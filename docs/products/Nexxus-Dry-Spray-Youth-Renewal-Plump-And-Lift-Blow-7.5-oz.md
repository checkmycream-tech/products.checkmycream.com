      <li>Not the best stuff I have used.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is wonderful for gray hair!  </li>
      <li>This blow-dry volumizing spray is not the best product in the Nexxus lineup.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s best.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This was the best deal I&#x27;ve found on this product.</li>
      <li>This spray works wonderfully -</li>

      <li>I like my hair to look great but have no noticeable gunk in it.</li>
      <li>Works great for my thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Smells great not over powering.</li>
      <li>It smells really great</li>
      <li>It does give great root lift.  </li>
      <li>I will use this up happily, but I prefer [[ASIN:B000B9WF8U Lemon-Grass Lift from Mop</li>
      <li>This Nexxus product has a great scent and does just what I hoped it would do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made a great difference in the health of my hair, more shine and strength !!</li>
      <li>The smell is very, very nice.  </li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>It smells good, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>some good quality ingredients</li>
      <li>It is a good product and Nexxus line can be trusted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved all but one of all the Nexxus products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smelled good though.</li>
      <li>For the price it is a very worth while product from a company that gives us the quality that we need to keep ourselves looking our best.</li>
      <li>I tried this product because of the great reviews, and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>It does a good job of adding a bit of volume to my hair and leaves it smelling nice.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is very nice, not at all overwhelming, and the manual spray gives out a controllable mist.</li>
      <li>I was formerly able to get without any product at all!</li>
      <li>This spray did however provide really amazing frizz control.  </li>
      <li>but I tried this and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>It gives my hair body, but it kind of leaves a bit of a sticky feeling.  </li>
      <li>I would buy this again because it does give you a nice bounce.  </li>
      <li>It also has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>I explained that I had read the information, but still did not know how to use the product most effectively.  </li>
      <li>Gives you the hold of hair spray without being brittle like in the old days and adds some really wonderful body to make your hair look</li>
      <li>and the smell quickly fades (a good</li>
      <li>I will not purchase any more of their products if this is the extent of their interest in their clients.</li>
      <li>This spray works more like hairspray than styling spray.</li>
      <li>Be sure that you pay attention when buying, because Nexxus also makes another spray conditioner that needs to be rinsed out.  </li>
      <li>used some at the roots, where my hair is the most lifeless, in hopes that I could gain some lift and/or thickening there.</li>
      <li>I love it and it does add volume to your hair.</li>
      <li>I love it and am so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>so perhaps it would work much better with someone who has more course hair.</li>
      <li>Would probably be a better product for hair that is perhaps thinner without the weight of my hair.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>and it is like magic.</li>
      <li>I felt when ordering this it may increase the shine and be more manageable.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see results and it acted a bit more like a spray gel.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product for my thinning, curly locks.</li>
      <li>I have purchased additional items in the Nexxus line and love them all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with that just because it&#x27;s more affordable</li>
      <li>It works better for me that way.</li>
      <li>the pump spritzes it out in more of a stream, so I put about 5-6 pumps in my hand and mix it around in my hair from end to roots.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I hope you get better results than I did.</li>
      <li>The combination of the two helps to give your hair more body.  </li>
      <li>I use it every day now and am quite pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because the fragrance is QUITE strong.  </li>
      <li>NOt helpful, not too bright and certainly a turn off regarding the products and their customer care.  </li>
      <li>This product has a nice, fresh, fragrance.</li>
      <li>Purchased on clearance , then checked Amazon price, can&#x27;t beat it and it gets delivered right to my door !!</li>
      <li>and it works better for my hair with good bounce, soft to the touch volume and shine.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often use hair products but when I do my goal is one easy product that does everything I need.</li>
      <li>This does not which makes it so easy.</li>
      <li>B00778LTDU Garnier Fructis Style XXL Body Thickening Mousse, Ultra Strong Hold, 6.8 Ounce]]</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for, and it&#x27;s pretty amazing when you do blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>but it did make it more full of body and my curls looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but this spray helps make it look thicker and stronger.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t super sticky, but was more \\&quot;product-y\\&quot; feeling than the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>As for frizziness, it didn&#x27;t help in that area at all, which kind of leaves you with the whole curly hair quandary again.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;*Offers light control without leaving the hair with a sticky, coated feel</li>
      <li>With all the great styling products out there in the same price range (around $15.00), this one just doesn&#x27;t stand out.</li>
      <li>I have a few that I like for volumizing (Bedhead&#x27;s S Factor is awesome)</li>
      <li>Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Smells fantastic....</li>
      <li>This was my first experience with a blow dry spray product and I was very impressed.</li>
      <li>There is a strong sweet smell which bothered me.</li>
      <li>So, I was excited to try this product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great blow dry spray.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, scent is lovely and not too strong and it actually provides volume to my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>One of those changes is that my hair is not as full of body as it used to be.</li>
      <li>This product has a lovely smell and works very well.  </li>
      <li>She said it was a good product and would consider buying it in the future if it were on sale.</li>
      <li>good price versus local retail</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it when blow drying my hair straight, so that would be interesting to see.</li>
      <li>think that someone with very fine/thinning hair might benefit from this product more than I did.  </li>
      <li>I like to have my hair looking full.</li>
      <li>Still not a bad product though, at all.</li>
      <li>It really does smooth the frizz and leaves my hair with just the right amount of healthy shine.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is really nice and even better when you start to blow dry your hair.  </li>
      <li>blow dry spray combats frizz, gives hair a nice shine, and makes it look healthy again.  </li>
      <li>This product provides better volume while allowing me to blow dry my hair to a nice style.</li>
      <li>But it an ordinary spray gel, and there are a lot of competitor products that are equally good and better priced.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend !!!</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight hair that gets highlighted a lot.</li>
      <li>and I literally section off each area just like my stylist does, but you get amazing volume so its worth the extra time.  </li>
      <li>I am only in my mid-30s but the changes are becoming more and more apparent as I age.  </li>
      <li>It left a nice and shiny look, and did not make my wife&#x27;s hair look greasy.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as a mousse, but is far more convenient.</li>
      <li>it is fresh smelling.  </li>
      <li>have long hair that is color treated and generally in pretty good shape.  </li>

    <li> Nexxus youth renewal lifts hair at the roots, creating a fuller look.  This product also seems to make blow drying faster.</li>
    <li> good price versus local retail</li>
    <li> I now use this product and this product  only for volume and hair fortifier !! It&#x27;s made a great difference in the health of my hair, more shine and strength !! My hair has always been very fine and fragile, but now I can grow it longer and retain the volume and strength . Purchased on clearance , then checked Amazon price, can&#x27;t beat it and it gets delivered right to my door !! Highly recommend !!!</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Smells fantastic....the smell also lasts well into the next day (many compliments)&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect amount of spray&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle will last a long time as you don&#x27;t need much&lt;br /&gt;-definitely lifts the hair&lt;br /&gt;-gives dry ends a &amp;#34;healthy look&amp;#34; as promised&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly thickens hair in a &amp;#34;natural way&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Can build up and get heavy quickly, so use lightly&lt;br /&gt;-Can get sticky if you don&#x27;t style/blow dry right away</li>
    <li> I have used this spray for about six months. I love it and it does add volume to your hair.</li>
    <li> Works great for my thinning hair. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had to stop using it because it strips the color off of my resistant gray.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, scent is lovely and not too strong and it actually provides volume to my fine hair.  It is more expensive than some other root volumizers but it is worth it.  I have purchased additional items in the Nexxus line and love them all.  I will definitely buy the Youth Renewal Plump and Lift spray again.</li>
    <li> Helps make my thin hair fuller</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful for gray hair!  Makes it soft shiny without weight.</li>
    <li> The product is actually good but the packaging/shipping was horrible.  The bottle was sealed in a plastic bag but the cap was loose so it leaked into the bag.  What a mess!!  How hard is it to ensure the cap is properly sealed and tight before shipment??</li>
    <li> Am glad to see that the price on this product has decreased a little as I use it all the time.  It does detangle my hair and gives it a little body after shampoos.  Be sure that you pay attention when buying, because Nexxus also makes another spray conditioner that needs to be rinsed out.  This does not which makes it so easy.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of the great reviews, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is super thin and frizzy and in bad shape.  Hardly anything makes it look good.  Except this blow dry spray, when I do blow dry (I try not to blow dry as much, as that can damage your hair, but even when I don&#x27;t, I have frizzy hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blow dry spray combats frizz, gives hair a nice shine, and makes it look healthy again.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down the hair very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have frizzy or damaged-looking hair and blow dry, try this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels if I use it and don&#x27;t blow dry.  I think it sort of has a crunchy feel to it if you don&#x27;t blow dry (probably meaning it would help it hold a style well).  But that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for, and it&#x27;s pretty amazing when you do blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have thin, frizzy, damaged-looking hair, try &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012UEJ1S/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B0012UEJ1S&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;dragonundergl-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;IWMXXZ27III4P4PZ\\&quot;&gt;John Frieda Liquid Shine Clear Hair Glaze, 6.5 Fluid Ounce&amp;lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best two products I&#x27;ve found for my crazy hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often use hair products but when I do my goal is one easy product that does everything I need. I usually want some volume at the root and shine, nothing too fancy. I have a bit longer than shoulder length, color treated straight hair. I was looking forward to making this Nexxus plump and lift blow dry spray my go to product, but it didn&#x27;t really cover all the bases for me.  I follow the directions and applied it to towel dried hair, worked it through and blow dried upside down for lift. It definitely \\&quot;plumps\\&quot; and makes my hair look fuller, but doesn&#x27;t give me the volume I&#x27;m looking for. Beyond that, I still needed a shine serum as this felt like it dulled my hair rather than improve it. It wasn&#x27;t super sticky, but was more \\&quot;product-y\\&quot; feeling than the [[ASIN:B00778LTDU Garnier Fructis Style XXL Body Thickening Mousse, Ultra Strong Hold, 6.8 Ounce]] I typically use. I like my hair to look great but have no noticeable gunk in it. I&#x27;m going to stick with that just because it&#x27;s more affordable and it works better for my hair with good bounce, soft to the touch volume and shine.</li>
    <li> This product has a lovely smell and works very well.  I&#x27;m not sure about the claims of renewing the hair on a permanent basis--suppose I would only know that after using the product for a longer duration--but as far as plumping up the hair and smoothing it for styling the product is excellent.  I will definitely buy it in the future and glad I got to try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really skeptical about hair care products.  I try so many, and most do not live up to their claims and basically waste my money.  However, this product is a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as directed and blow dried my hair to big, bouncy fullness. This makes your hair \\&quot;fluffy,\\&quot; -- it&#x27;s almost a dry feeling, as opposed to other products that will make your hair shiny and sleek.  (Just to be clear, the hair doesn&#x27;t LOOK dry.)  I use it every day now and am quite pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because the fragrance is QUITE strong.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but the first couple of times I could smell it all day.  Now I don&#x27;t notice it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product certainly gives you extra volume when used with a blow dryer, though 80% seems like a pretty high estimate.  As for frizziness, it didn&#x27;t help in that area at all, which kind of leaves you with the whole curly hair quandary again.  Oil/Serum to reduce frizziness and then it kills your volume... oh well.  I would buy this again because it does give you a nice bounce.  I haven&#x27;t tried it when blow drying my hair straight, so that would be interesting to see.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice, fresh, fragrance. This spray is supposed to add an 80% increase in volume, while maintaining touchable softness. I used this spray on half my hair to test it out. While I admit it did not weigh it down and did, indeed, maintain the \\&quot;touchable softness\\&quot;, I did not really feel it increased volume. The treated side looked pretty much like the untreated side.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair body, but it kind of leaves a bit of a sticky feeling.  Not the best stuff I have used.  I don&#x27;t spray it on directly b/c the pump spritzes it out in more of a stream, so I put about 5-6 pumps in my hand and mix it around in my hair from end to roots.  That way it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at the roots.  It works better for me that way.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have ordered several times. It makes my hair soft and less frizzy in humid weather.</li>
    <li> I am only in my mid-30s but the changes are becoming more and more apparent as I age.  One of those changes is that my hair is not as full of body as it used to be. I cut off the length of my hair to my shoulders hoping it would take the weight off and my hair won&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s glued to my scalp.  It helped but I am still flat at my roots.  I have a few that I like for volumizing (Bedhead&#x27;s S Factor is awesome) but I am always open to try others.  So, when Vine offered the chance to try the Nexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray I figured it can&#x27;t hurt! I do like the Nexxus line of hair care anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this after showering and washing my hair.  The smell is very, very nice.  First thing I noticed is that this is not a sticky product.  When I finished blow drying, I definitely noticed more volume and my hair didn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.  I am very pleased.  The staying power didn&#x27;t hold through the day but I haven&#x27;t found one that lasts 10 hours that isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy.  All and all... thumbs up, Nexxus.</li>
    <li> I really like this blow dry spray for volumizing my fine hair. It leaves no residue after application and blow drying, plus it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair as so many of these products do. The smell is also really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and blow dryed my hair upside down, which I do believe makes a big difference to the end result. I find that if you do this until it is almost dry and then finish blow drying your hair upright it stops it from being too &#x27;fly-away&#x27;. I use hair straighteners to then get the desired style that I want.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say about this spray is that it comes out rather thickly and not in a fine mist as I expected. Therefore it is a good idea to comb it through your hair a little bit before blow-drying, just to ensure there is even distribution.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this product and find that the volume it gives lasts for the entire day. I have used this every day for a week and have had the same results each time, plus my hair still feels soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> I recived this product through the Vine program and ordered it because if it says it will give your hair volumne and is youth renewable I wanted to try it.  I am 87 years old and my hair is thick so I did not notice that much difference.  This spray is used after you towel it dry and before you blow dry your hair.  I really did not have all the problems with aging hair mentioned as breakage, less shine, brittleness, unruliness of loss of color etc.  At my age I already lost most of the color and is now shades of grey with darker streaks.  I felt when ordering this it may increase the shine and be more manageable.  I did not notice any of this, but the product is easy to use and no unusual smell a it is fresh smelling.  They suggest to hold your head down and then blow dry your hair which I did but I came up with my hair looking like a scare crow so now just blow dry it normally.  It is a good product and Nexxus line can be trusted.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not weigh it down but ads some volume.&lt;br /&gt;the product smells okay and the smell quickly fades (a good thing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like with all product though by end of the day my hair starts to look greasy and weighed down.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on here, but I felt compelled since I bought this product based on the reviews.  I have very naturally curly, yet fine hair and use a plethora of different volumizing products.  I wanted to try this as an alternative so I could &amp;#34;mix it up&amp;#34; and not have my hair become too acclimated to the other products I like and start not working as well, which tends to happen when you use any single product too long.  I wear my hair both curly (diffuse dry) and also straight (blow it straight with a volumizing roll brush) so I tried this both ways.  When I wore it straight, it was almost too straight and seemed to lack the normal volume I get when I blow dry it straight and was almost flat looking. Note it is a pain staking process and I literally section off each area just like my stylist does, but you get amazing volume so its worth the extra time.  When I wore it curly, although I liked the volume and look of the curl initially, I almost seemed to have to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; my hair throughout the entire day to get it back to that look as it would look very flat (and unattractive) within a half hour it seemed.  So I probably would not use this again or recommend it to anyone.  On a positive note, it does make your hair feel really soft so perhaps it would work much better with someone who has more course hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this particular Nexxus line.  It smells really great and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray took a minute to prime but since I got it  primed it works well.  It&#x27;s  a clear spray that feels a bit like a gel when dried.  It does a good job of adding a bit of volume to my hair and leaves it smelling nice.  I tried it without the blow dryer too, in the sauna.  It left my hair feeling a tad stiff, which quickly brushed out to a soft feeling, and it STILL had a bit more volume, though I had not used a hair dryer and left it just completely flat on my head to dry.  Another time I tied my hair up in a slipknot on top of my head and let it dry in the sauna- that worked very well and my hair, once brushed, had big loose curls and lots of volume, more like when it&#x27;s been blown dry.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind using this Blow Dry Spray. It didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair looker thicker (it states on the bottle it will) but it did make it more full of body and my curls looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used some at the roots, where my hair is the most lifeless, in hopes that I could gain some lift and/or thickening there. I didn&#x27;t see results and it acted a bit more like a spray gel. I also applied it to the bulk of the hair and ends, where I did see improvement in the body - it made my curls perk up a bit, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it looked thicker at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would continue to use this product for the added body, because I did like the results, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it or recommend as a thickener. Different hair types will have different results though, so it may work better as a thickener for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to be too rough on my hair, so that&#x27;s also a plus. Sometimes with certain products, when you wash your hair you can feel that the texture is kind of rough from the product - that didn&#x27;t happen with this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 stars because I did like the results, but took off that 5th star due to it not actually making the hair look or seem/feel thicker at all, for me. Still not a bad product though, at all.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time today and ~can~ see a boost in volume. I did not notice any particular scent, pleasant, unpleasant or otherwise. I have short hair so I do not bend over to dry my hair as the bottle suggests but I did spray liberally and comb through before blow-drying. My hair is not sticky and the hold seems firm but flexible. My hair is not thin but I am 50+ so it is not as thick as perhaps a younger persons hair might be and could result in more volume than others might experience with more or even longer hair. Overall I am pleased and will consider purchasing this product again in the future</li>
    <li> Does build body in &amp;#34;mature, thinning&amp;#34; hair. Great results especially when used in combination with other Nexus Youth Renewal products.</li>
    <li> There is some confusion about proper use of this product.  When I called their customer care line, the person with whom I spoke did not understand the problem( conflicting instructions) and could or would do nothing but read the information to me.  Same info was included in the product packaging and did not address the problem.  I explained that I had read the information, but still did not know how to use the product most effectively.  She seemed that the extent of her knowledge or care was to read to me.  NOt helpful, not too bright and certainly a turn off regarding the products and their customer care.  I will not purchase any more of their products if this is the extent of their interest in their clients.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this plump spray to work, because I have very fine, naturally wavy hair that I am constantly fighting with to get volume.  But this didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  Not only did it not add any volume, but it weighed my hair down.  My hair looks crunchy after using this, and it goes flat in a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using a decent amount of spray, when my hair was wet and then blow-dried it upside down.  I thought perhaps I used too much spray, so the next time I used about half the amount I used the first time.  I got the same results.  Flat, crunchy looking hair.  I don&#x27;t know why this doesn&#x27;t work for my hair, as others are raving about it.  It smells good, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but if you think it might work for you, give it a try.  I hope you get better results than I did.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, and is thin at the temples.  I have to be very careful with my hair products and the way I style my hair, in order to camouflage the problem.  I have been using Nexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray for almost a month, and I am very pleased with the results.  After my hair is towel dried, I mist it lightly with this Nexxus spray, and comb it through to distribute evenly.  I then use my normal brand of mousse, blow dry with a round brush, and style it like I normally do.  This does not take the place of my normal hair spray, but it definitely makes a difference in the volume of my hair, without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit expensive compared to some other brands of spray volumizer, but I will purchase this in the future when I run out.  Based on the amount I have used so far on my short hair, I estimate that the bottle should last me around 3 months, with daily usage.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have fine hair, but this spray helps make it look thicker and stronger. HIghly recommend for women with fine or thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was skeptical that a few sprays of this product could plump and lift my fine, thin hair, but it has.  I used to use mousse, but my hair would always feel almost sticky.  So, I was excited to try this product.  I apply a few sprays to my damp hair after shampooing and conditioning.  I brush the product in and blow dry.  My hair is fluffy and silky.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> This Nexxus product has a great scent and does just what I hoped it would do. I concentrated the application near the roots of my hair, and when I blew out my hair it gave me outrageous fullness that lasted &#x27;till the end of the day. This is well named Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray, because it gave my hair the look I was formerly able to get without any product at all! Several people actually commented that I was lucky to have \\&quot;so much hair!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
    <li> This is a styling product that you spray on wet/damp hair before blow drying.  I&#x27;ve used it a number of times, and while it&#x27;s not bad by any means I certainly wasn&#x27;t wowed by its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair that is color treated and generally in pretty good shape.  While the individual texture of my hair is fine, I do have a ton of it.  What I was looking for - and what this product claims to do - is to add a little body while at the same time controlling frizz.  The product delivered, at least partially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Offers light control without leaving the hair with a sticky, coated feel&lt;br /&gt;*Leaves the hair soft and shiny looking&lt;br /&gt;*Contains some good quality ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Strong fragrance&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t expect a big volume \\&quot;boost\\&quot;; I didn&#x27;t notice much difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that someone with very fine/thinning hair might benefit from this product more than I did.  With all the great styling products out there in the same price range (around $15.00), this one just doesn&#x27;t stand out.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this \\&quot;Blow Dry Spray\\&quot; would provide more lift to my hair than it did.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as a mousse, but is far more convenient. Would probably be a better product for hair that is perhaps thinner without the weight of my hair.</li>
    <li> Nexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray is applied to the hair after towel drying. I was very skeptical but it does give the hair a nice sheen and texture and truly even more volume without making it feel like it&#x27;s been coated with shellac or pomade. The fragrance is very nice, not at all overwhelming, and the manual spray gives out a controllable mist. I am very sensitive to some fragrances and sprays but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This spray works more like hairspray than styling spray. It felt sticky and very stiff on my hair. I expected it to feel more natural so was surprised by the stickiness. That said, it does hold. I just wasn&#x27;t as comfortable putting it on my hair on a daily basis. There is a strong sweet smell which bothered me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved all but one of all the Nexxus products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great blow dry spray.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any type of buildup on the hair, and yet it does add some volume.  I already have very thick, dense hair and when I use this it poofs it out so that it is so thick, it looks like I have enough hair for two people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I aim this down at my roots on my damp hair, then blow it out straight, I have a ton of hair, that stands away from my scalp nicely, and stays that way until the next day.  It&#x27;s a hairspray basically, but the heat sets it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is too flat to your head try this.  It does give great root lift.  I do recommend bending over at the waist and first drying your hair as it hangs forward, before then brushing it back into your preferred style, for maximum volume.</li>
    <li> I very seldom use a blow dryer just for the fact that my hair is short but I tried this and really liked it.  I used it with the corrosponding shampoo and conditioner and my say that it looked like I had my hair done at the salon.  Gives you the hold of hair spray without being brittle like in the old days and adds some really wonderful body to make your hair look it&#x27;s best.  The fragrance is really nice and even better when you start to blow dry your hair.  For the price it is a very worth while product from a company that gives us the quality that we need to keep ourselves looking our best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with Nexus&#x27; Youth Renewal line. This spray works wonderfully - it&#x27;s lightweight, not sticky, and it gives my hair just the right amount of hold without making it hard and stiff. It really does smooth the frizz and leaves my hair with just the right amount of healthy shine. This was my first experience with a blow dry spray product and I was very impressed. It also has a light, pleasant scent. Great product!</li>
    <li> An old trick to getting more volume out of your hair is to blow dry your hair upside down.  The directions say to use this to blow dry your hair upside down.  The combination of the two helps to give your hair more body.  You could achieve the same effect somewhat without the use of products, but the spray helps maintain the hold.  It left a nice and shiny look, and did not make my wife&#x27;s hair look greasy.  She said it was a good product and would consider buying it in the future if it were on sale.</li>
    <li> If you are tired of limp dried out frizzt hair then this is the blow dry spray for you. I like to have my hair looking full. Sometimes I cannot get that. But by using a round brush and Nexxus Youth Renewal this will make your hair full of body not dried out and limp and brittle. You will see a big difference in your hair. Smells great not over powering.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about a year now. I have fine, straight hair that gets highlighted a lot. And, yes, I noticed my hair becoming drier as I aged. I found this and tried it. The sprayer on the bottle I don&#x27;t like. It sprays out a very coarse stream. So, I spray about 15 pumps into my hand and smear it around and coat the outside of my hair and comb through. This was the best deal I&#x27;ve found on this product. I usually pay $20 for it in most stores around here. I also use Pureology Pure Volume Blow Dry Amplifier gel. This, I put only on the roots and out about 2-3 inches from roots. The two products combined make my hair look shiny and like I have twice as much hair. But I will say that this Nexxus product does give my hair its youth back. I style with round blow-dry brush (hair in Bob) and it is like magic. I have shine and bounce I haven&#x27;t had in a long time.</li>
    <li> I was using mousse until I found this product. This product provides better volume while allowing me to blow dry my hair to a nice style. I love it and am so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair, but I usually like to add a bit of volume.  Sometimes I use spray and other times I just tease it.  The sprays can lead to faster results.  I was disappointed by this product.  First, I did not notice much in the way of volume.  Next, the product left a sticky feeling on my hair.  It also did not promote longevity of the hair style.  Due to hard water, I try to minimize the number of times I wash my hair in a week (two to three washes is optimal for me).  After waking up, my hair was disgusting.  It looked greasy and even though it had been straightened the day prior, my hair had a bunch of curls.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product for my thinning, curly locks. It&#x27;s never sticky, wear well over the days I don&#x27;t shampoo, and is very expensive. (That part I&#x27;m not so crazy about.)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think anything will make my hair increase 80% in volume like this implies is possible, I mean short of emptying a can of hair spray into it.  This spray did however provide really amazing frizz control.  My long straight hair was beautifully smooth, and not weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this almost daily in Florida (visiting Nana) and it has really helped my hair anti-poodle from the humidity!</li>
    <li> This blow-dry volumizing spray is not the best product in the Nexxus lineup.  There is nothing wrong with it; it&#x27;s not sticky or odd-smelling.  But it an ordinary spray gel, and there are a lot of competitor products that are equally good and better priced.  I will use this up happily, but I prefer [[ASIN:B000B9WF8U Lemon-Grass Lift from Mop [8.45 fl. oz.]]]... IF I want a spray product. I find that for my hair, spray volumizers tend to be stiff and not well distributed throughout the hair, a spray-gel effect. Lotion volumizers are much easier to distribute evenly.</li>
    <li> If you want to look like Bozo when you use a \\&quot;plump and lift\\&quot; product then this one is for you.  It did plump but it also minimized all control.  I ended up showering again and starting from scratch with my regular hair products.  Definitely disappointed.  Smelled good though.</li>
