    <li> Best product for hair</li>
    <li> I love love love this product!  Keeps my hair manageable and healthy without the use of chemical products.  Very handy when in a rush or when you need your hair looking good and aren&#x27;t in a position to wash product out of your hair that same day. Be sure not to use a lot our it does make your scalp and hair too greasy which can clog pores.  Rule of thumb for any hair product is to use sparingly and never near the roots of your hair.</li>
    <li> I truly like the palmers coconut oil formula moisture grow . It really moisturizes your hair . It smells so good it is long lasting as well. A little goes a long way. I use it after deep conditioning my hair. I mix a little with black castor oil and oil my entire scalp  and massage my scalp for 5-10 minutes.  I will definetely be making another purchase soon.  I still have more left.</li>
    <li> love their skin products but not their hair products</li>
    <li> This hair formula is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. Makes my natural hair soft, shiny and manageable. It&#x27;s really really good.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair. I use this product after I shampoo, condition, and towel dry my hair. I apply it liberally at my ends and then the rest of my hair, using a little more where my hair is more dry. Don&#x27;t use too much at first, that way you&#x27;ll see how much your hair requires...you don&#x27;t want your hair to appear greasy!! I love this product and the coconut scent is a bonus! Retouch dry areas when hair is dry, by rewetting with a little water and a dab of product!</li>
    <li> Me and FH are in love with this! his barber was feeling on his hair and said it felt very soft. i get comment all the time bout my hair how shine and health it looks and how long it got. Very good product i would buy this!</li>

    <li> SUPER SHINNING HAIR, soft with a pleasant smell of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for people with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I did not order this but brought it from my local Wal-Mart! My hair was dry and lifeless so I went hunting for a healthier hair dress alternative!After buying the Coconut Oil by Palmer&#x27;s, I went home and washed my hair and cut my ends and blow dried my hair. Took a quarter sized amount and rubbed in my hands then ran my hands through my scalp to my ends! Ater hair was completely dry I repeated and rubbed it through my hair and sectioned my hair for flat ironing! Took me 20 minutes to flat iron! My hair was gorgeous!!!!! I have been using it now for 5 month&#x27;s and my hair is young and vibrant again...not to mention manageable!!! I am 56 years young and I look younger now just because of the Palmer&#x27;s Coconut oil Hair Gro! Thanks for whoever invented it! I still have my first jar but I am buying another just to have when the other is gone!&lt;br /&gt;Want it on hand! Afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it when I need it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this coconut oil it has made my hair so soft and so shiny I cannot even explain it. If you straighten your hair a lot and your hair gets frizzy I would suggest buying this item it works wonders!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I use this in conjunction with castor oil as a primary hair care product for my daughters. It smells great and aids with hair growth.</li>
    <li> Great product highly recommended to all makes all the difference to my appearence especially when nature dries the hair out .</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Palmers Coconut Oil for the hair but I was a bit disappointed with this product.  This is not a lotion or cream for the hair.  It has the texture of cold oil.  It was a bit hard to rub on my hands and apply to the hair.  I will not purchase this product again...sticking with the hair oil.</li>
    <li> I use this every almost every nite.. AWSOME!!!</li>
    <li> Used this in the past but was unable to find it in the stores.  Was delighted when I found it at Amazon.com.  It is the best product ever. Great moisterizer for very dry curly hair.  Smells wonderful and it does not have as much petrolatum as most moisterizers which is really nice as that makes your hair stiff.</li>
    <li> This worked better than I expected. love the way it sleeks the hair down for a smooth look, when I wear my&lt;br /&gt;natural hair in a ponytail. the smell is ok.</li>
    <li> No worries with the product its all good and greatly sealed. I&#x27;m very proud of this outcome. I have two so it&#x27;s a go</li>
