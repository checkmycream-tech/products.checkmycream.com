      <li>My order arrived promptly and I was able to give as Christmas gift.</li>
      <li>Since using this product my skin feels and smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>I had to order the Top 6, and I love them all.</li>
      <li>Just wish this was available to be ordered in Prime!</li>
      <li>I am in love with these soaps.</li>
      <li>Love all the samples included with purchase.   </li>
      <li>Awesome love it, already purchase a second set..</li>
      <li>I love these soaps.</li>
      <li>Gave one to my Mom and sister as a gift, they love it.</li>
      <li>Smells great and makes your skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Everyone in my family agrees that it literally makes you squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>My daughter loved it, it smelled up the whole house, we all knew what it was before she opened it.</li>
      <li>But other then that the soap is 5 stars and the best.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s great to be able to try different ones.</li>
      <li>Excellent all natural soaps, very fragrant.  </li>
      <li>The scents are strong and fragrant.</li>
      <li>I simply love the mild scent and the moisturizing quality of these soaps; I will buy them again.</li>
      <li>Great soap 2nd time around ordering this combo!</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Very gentle and mild, yet effective cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Very nice smelling and lasts a long time, I bought them months ago and they are still going strong.</li>
      <li>All of them smell  and look wonderful - I especially like the patchouli, which really surprised me.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased many products from Plant Life and the soaps are by far my favorite product.</li>
      <li>Skin feels clean after use.</li>
      <li>It rinses clean.</li>
      <li>It leaves no film or residue, just a nice natural essence and leaves you genuinely clean.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>What more does one want from a natural organic soap?</li>
      <li>I love the scents and that they&#x27;re so well made, all natural without the additives found in all of the popular brands found at your local market, and the essential oils make taking a shower a nice, relaxing experience.</li>
      <li>just the right amount.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this soap, but I was pleasantly surprised that it lathered up so well and was very moisturizing!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Only if I can have my husband stop using it :-)</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the feel but does become flimsy as it gets smaller.  </li>
      <li>They are really pretty and organic to look at.</li>
      <li>The fact that it has yet to cause any irritation to either of our skins is the main reason we keep coming back and buying more.</li>
      <li>My wife is not crazy about the square corners but that is what real soap looks like because originally it was left to set in a pan and is cut to squares rather than injection molded.</li>
      <li>It does not stink up the whole house.</li>
      <li>The soaps are very fragrant and come in a variety of flavors.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and the scents are invigorating and relaxing.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m particularly fond of the shape.</li>
      <li>They all left my skin felling soft and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>my wife and I both have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The only thing that would make them better is if they were individually wrapped instead of side by side in the same box.</li>
      <li>They make your skin so soft!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, not extreme in smell...</li>
      <li>Only draw back is that it the bars are soft and melt away quickly.  </li>
      <li>They actually lather really well also.  </li>
      <li>This is the only soap that I can use on my skin because it doesn&#x27;t have all of that perfume stuff in it that normally dries my skin.</li>

    <li> EXCELLENT!  I love these soaps. High oil content, moisturizing, wonderful fragrance. It rinses clean. Gave one to my Mom and sister as a gift, they love it.</li>
    <li> I especially enjoyed the vanilla-orange aroma. They all left my skin felling soft and comfortable.  I would order the vanilla-orange again.</li>
    <li> Aroma is strong but subtle. Very gentle and mild, yet effective cleanser.  Skin feels clean after use. No residue soap on skin.</li>
    <li> I love these soaps! All of them smell  and look wonderful - I especially like the patchouli, which really surprised me.  They scents are subtle and leave my skin soft and clean. Love all the samples included with purchase.   Great company, great products.</li>
    <li> I like the soaps  , just I feel its too poor in essential oils. Barely I can smell it .</li>
    <li> Great product, aroma is exceptional, lovely variety.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many products from Plant Life and the soaps are by far my favorite product. The scents are strong and fragrant. They are not sticky like store bought soap and last much longer than average. Very happy with my purchases</li>
    <li> Love this brand...worth every oenny</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling and lasts a long time, I bought them months ago and they are still going strong. Thanks!</li>
    <li> . Not overpowering. It does not stink up the whole house. I like to give it as a gift. My wife is not crazy about the square corners but that is what real soap looks like because originally it was left to set in a pan and is cut to squares rather than injection molded.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that I can use on my skin because it doesn&#x27;t have all of that perfume stuff in it that normally dries my skin. It helps my skin because I have eczema. This is worth buying!!! Only if I can have my husband stop using it :-) This gives me a chance to buy more.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend, not extreme in smell...just the right amount. Each soap lasts me about  3.5-4 weeks. Not  cheap like buying Ivory body soap at your local grocer, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted with these soaps. The only thing that would make them better is if they were individually wrapped instead of side by side in the same box. The scents tend to blend together but it&#x27;s still a nice scent. Some scents I like better than others but it&#x27;s great to be able to try different ones.</li>
    <li> Plantlife top 6. It was Xmas present to a friend. She is very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> The scents wake up the senses!  I love them!  I have only tried this brand and I repurchase every time.</li>
    <li> Just received my order of Plantlife soaps and they all smell amazing!!! I can not wait to  try them out!</li>
    <li> Excellent all natural soaps, very fragrant.  Have already let family, friends and coworkers know about these products.  I&#x27;ve previously purchased Plant Life soaps and intend to continue to do so.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE GREAT !  HAVE ORDERED BEFORE AND VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. DOES LAST A WHILE AND EACH SCENT IF NOT SO OVERPOWERING.  DOESN&#x27;T DRY MY SKIN OUT LIKE OTHER SOAPS.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this soap, but I was pleasantly surprised that it lathered up so well and was very moisturizing! The smells are not too overpowering either, which was a pleasant surprise as well.  Would order again!</li>
    <li> I simply love the mild scent and the moisturizing quality of these soaps; I will buy them again. The price was also good and they were packaged well.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and the scents are invigorating and relaxing.  Best of all they are all natural, love that the most.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it, it smelled up the whole house, we all knew what it was before she opened it.</li>
    <li> We love this soap!!! It smells wonderful and is great for people with sensitive skin, my wife and I both have very sensitive skin so a harsh soap just will not work for us. We both like the way it cleans and does not leave a soap residue on our skin. The fact that it has yet to cause any irritation to either of our skins is the main reason we keep coming back and buying more.</li>
    <li> The scents are sublime...so this product not only cleanses with a soft insistence, but leaves behind a sublime scent that lingers. What more does one want from a natural organic soap? Nada!</li>
    <li> Wife loves them. Convenient size, great lather and wonderful aroma.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. The soaps are very fragrant and come in a variety of flavors. My only issue was that the package arrived a little banged up. Some of the soaps were dented, so I would recommend better packaging. I gave these as a gift and my mother in law loved them.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the feel but does become flimsy as it gets smaller.  Has a tendency to crumble but still a great product.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love how clean this soap gets me!! It&#x27;s definitely my favorite! Everyone in my family agrees that it literally makes you squeaky clean! It leaves no film or residue, just a nice natural essence and leaves you genuinely clean.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these soaps.  The bars are a substantial size.  They smell wonderful and make nice soft suds.</li>
    <li> The soaps smell wonderful. I love them!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  Smells great and makes your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I love the scents and that they&#x27;re so well made, all natural without the additives found in all of the popular brands found at your local market, and the essential oils make taking a shower a nice, relaxing experience. I detest the artificial smell of Proctor &amp; Gamble, etc.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for.  could be packaged separately so the scents don&#x27;t mingle.</li>
    <li> Awesome love it, already purchase a second set..</li>
    <li> PlantLife makes the best aromatherapy soaps. My order arrived promptly and I was able to give as Christmas gift. The recipient loved it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to display and scent my guest bathroom which they do very nicely.  They are not overpowering or fake smelling.  They actually lather really well also.  They are really pretty and organic to look at.</li>
    <li> I have used a few of the bars so far.  It has very pleasant scent; cleans and rinses off well.  Only draw back is that it the bars are soft and melt away quickly.  Try to stand them on the edge in the soap dish; that will help to make them last longer.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these soaps. After what seemed to be an endless search for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bath and shower products, I was ecstatic to come across this brand. The soaps smell wonderful and do a great job of moisturizing. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Fantastic Product with great smells! Their soaps sound so great I had to order the Top 6, and I love them all. I am in Afghanistan where the water is hard and full of chlorine. Since using this product my skin feels and smells fantastic! I will def order again! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product has prevented breaking out do to sensitive skin! Great soap 2nd time around ordering this combo! Just wish this was available to be ordered in Prime! But other then that the soap is 5 stars and the best.</li>
    <li> These soaps smell great and make great gifts.  I gave them out to all the ladies at our office.  They loved them.</li>
    <li> These soaps are so fragrant! They make your skin so soft! Can&#x27;t wait to start the next bar! And they do last a while... I will definitely suggest this to friends!</li>
    <li> Good size for guest bath. Quite aromatic. But I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m particularly fond of the shape.</li>
    <li> These soaps are great. They smell nice and feel great on the skin. They don&#x27;t make me itch afterwards like other store brands. They are of course a luxury. Unless you can afford it, they are not for everyday use. They make excellent presents.</li>
