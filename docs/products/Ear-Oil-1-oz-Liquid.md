      <li>I use it all the time and love it!</li>
      <li>It smelled more like a pleasant tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil smell.  </li>
      <li>and I remember a more pleasant smell</li>
      <li>product is amazing.</li>
      <li>These antibiotics don&#x27;t treat the problem and not to mention they end up killing all the good bacteria leaving the child prone to more infections and an upset tummy.</li>
      <li>Effective.  </li>
      <li>I also tried putting baked onion vapours in his ears and gave him warm massage on the ears</li>
      <li>Do your own search-</li>
      <li>The oil smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I changed tactics to putting 3-4 drops of warm olive oil 3 nights in a row and on the 4th day, my cotton bud scooped it all out (yuck).</li>
      <li>oil, I was kind of hesitant.</li>
      <li>Liked it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is good for something.</li>
      <li>Really nice stuff.</li>
      <li>It is acute pain now.  </li>
      <li>I does have a nice cleansing aroma.</li>
      <li>and u don&#x27;t need to heat it, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>No ear infections of any kind.</li>
      <li>I cover the ear opening with a cotton ball and cover all of that with a comfortably warm gel pack heating pad.  </li>
      <li>If you get a pleasant smelling bottle of this, count yourself fortunate.  </li>
      <li>just have to remember more is not always better!</li>
      <li>I used this product for 2+ years with great success at warding off ear infections for my daughter.  </li>
      <li>When it smelled like tea tree oil, I liked it better because that is not an offensive smell to most people.  </li>
      <li>My ear has been fine ever since!</li>
      <li>should&#x27;nt matter how many words i use to describe or rate this product, just what i think of it.</li>
      <li>I was able to remove the gook from my ear .</li>
      <li>and I thought for sure that I was going to end up in urgent care for an ear infection.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>so I feel confident in using it.</li>
      <li>I can feel some healing going on, though I think I may need more help than the oil can give.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>By the time he reached 6-7 episodes of ear infections, I started a more aggressive quest for an alternative remedy.</li>
      <li>I make sure I always have a bottle in the medicine cabinet.</li>
      <li>I have had to buy more since I have twice ended up giving my partially-used bottle away to friends with earaches.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this to go more of a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; route....I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>It works best for me when prior to bed I take 500 mg of Quercetin and 1000 mg of Bromelian.  </li>
      <li>You must be able to be at peace with that.  </li>
      <li>This product has changed ingredients since, it does smell much more like garlic.</li>
      <li>I have tried many others and most irritated my ears.</li>
      <li>The company even called to make sure I got the product and how I was liking it.  </li>
      <li>and then her body was able to fight the infection since she has not been on antibiotics for a year.</li>
      <li>This item is ok.  </li>
      <li>We recently went for a well visit for my boys and the doctor was very impressed after looking at their ears.</li>
      <li>Not any more.</li>
      <li>more Wally&#x27;s for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if another ear oil would have worked better, but I&#x27;ll stick with Wally&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i am not sure of the benefits here, but will use a few more times to give it a full test</li>
    <li> Yes, your ear will smell like garlic.  You must be able to be at peace with that.  My ear gives me the blues:  almost constant itching and pain.  Once the pain gets unbearable it&#x27;s back on antibiotics...again.  I was taking antibiotics every 6 to 8 weeks and hating it; the relief from antibiotics is always temporary.  I have allergies and lots of sinus problems.  I have tried EVERYTHING.  I have found that Wally&#x27;s ear oil does make me feel more comfortable.  It works best for me when prior to bed I take 500 mg of Quercetin and 1000 mg of Bromelian.  That gets the swelling down so the oil can \\&quot;get in there\\&quot;.  I lie on my side with  the \\&quot;good ear\\&quot; on the pillow and the \\&quot;bad ear\\&quot; pointing up toward the ceiling.  I use the dropper to add a small amount of ear oil to the bad ear.  I cover the ear opening with a cotton ball and cover all of that with a comfortably warm gel pack heating pad.  I can sleep through the night and there is less pain in the morning.  I also take two 500 mg doses of Bromelain during the day.  I&#x27;m an adult, so a child&#x27;s dose would be different.  Please consult with a supplement expert to determine the right dose for you or your child for any supplement.  It also seems to help to use the oil with a cotton ball during the day. Bottom line: I do recommend this product and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> A must have for ear infections.</li>
    <li> I WASTED ALMOST THE WHOLE BOTTLE AND IT DID NOT SOFTEN MY SON&#x27;S EAR WAX. HENCE, COULD NOT FLUSH IT OUT. SORRY!</li>
    <li> This item is ok.  I guess it does what it says.  I am just not sure what I was expecting from it really.  I am using it to try and soften up the ear wax prior to using a syringe to remove the wax.  It did not seem to work, but like I said, not sure what I was expecting from it anyway.</li>
    <li> I was tired of giving medicine to my daughter every time she had a cold and ear infection.  That left her nervous and each time she had to take stronger antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I decided just to wait and observe her.  I gave her these ear drops for comfort, a lot of fluids, and after 2 weeks she was completely recovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is 3y and cannot tell if she is in pain.  But I could see she was feeling better after these drops: less cranky, more apetite</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My daughter kept getting ear infections every time she got a tooth.  Ever since I started using this product, no more ear infections!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> my ears clog after flying, and sometimes just driving into higher elevations...this is the only oil that breaks through the clog and allows me to hear normally again.  that muffled hearing can drive one crazy and make you feel bad all around.  a couple of times I&#x27;ve had to use a few drops, then another half hour maybe another few drops....in the past I&#x27;d have to finally break down and go to the doctor to get the ears flushed....this stuff is magic.</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous if you have dry, itchy ears or struggle with frequent ear problems.  I use it all the time and love it!</li>
    <li> This contains natural products (herbs, etc.) so I feel confident in using it. It is soothing as soon as you put it in your ear. It really seems to help, better than the drugstore OTC products. I make sure I always have a bottle in the medicine cabinet. I have had to buy more since I have twice ended up giving my partially-used bottle away to friends with earaches.</li>
    <li> I bought it to have it &#x27;just in case&#x27; for my baby ... i ended up using it on myself once I felt a little earache coming (I used to get ear infections all the time up to few years ago) ... I think it somehow helped although the mell is extremely powerful, it smells like very strong garlic, I have to store it in a ziplock otherwise my whole cabinet smells.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews on this product after searching for something after the 4th time to the doctor with my 11 month old and an ear infection. I decided to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did. We have been ear infection free in our house for 3 months now. At the first tug of the ear, I put a few drops in and it doesn&#x27;t progress. I definitely recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> My son has very itchy ears.  He is constantly pulling on them, trying to relieve the itchiness.  I brought him to the Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor, but that didn&#x27;t help.  They cleaned his ears, but the itchiness never left.  So, I bought this hoping to bring him some relief.  It has helped.  After he uses this, I don&#x27;t see him yanking on his ears for a few days.  When he starts to do it again, I encourage him to add a few drops.  I love that it is natural ingredients.  When we run out, I will be buying more :)</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than I could find locally and did the job</li>
    <li> I purchased this ear oil because my 4 yo has had ear infections for the last 5 months and I would rather not use antibiotics.  I have only used it for this past month and also have stopped most of her dairy intake and started using saline spray daily.  So far so good.  She has monthly allergy attacks and up until she turned 3 never had an ear infection, until she started eating dairy.  So what I am basically saying is.....I am not sure about this product yet for ear infections.  The dropper works well and u don&#x27;t need to heat it, which is nice.  She doesn&#x27;t mind when I use it.</li>
    <li> I use it every time I have my ears candled and every time I candle someones ears! Stuff works wonders!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything from prescription medication for my itchy ears to this stuff. It does not work but I will tell you what has stopped my itchy ears after all these ears.....HYDOCORTISONE CREAM! I tell no lies. Put some cream on a  swab, insert in ears, and let cream sit in there...instant results!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! We have been using this oil at the first sign of ear discomfort and sometimes as a preventative measure after swimming. In a household of 8 people we haven&#x27;t had an ear infection since we discovered Wally&#x27;s Ear Oil, that was 14 years ago! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have two children, aged 19 months and 6 months old. My 19 month old started getting ear infections since he was 7 months old. As new parents we didn&#x27;t know any better. So we went with treating him with antibiotics. Within a month, he got another one. Since I strongly believe in natural treatments, I started hunting for alternatives. I came across several home remedies and some of them worked but not consistently. By the time he reached 6-7 episodes of ear infections, I started a more aggressive quest for an alternative remedy. These antibiotics don&#x27;t treat the problem and not to mention they end up killing all the good bacteria leaving the child prone to more infections and an upset tummy. I got tired of this process. Also, I didn&#x27;t want my younger one to go through the same things. After several visits to blogs and different sites, I found WALLYS ear oil. Soon after we bought this oil, my elder one developed an ear infection. We got the prescription for the antibiotics but decided to hold off until we used the oil for few days. Also, this time we used Hylands ear ache drops for pain management instead of Advil. Within the next day he stopped tugging his ears and in 3 days, infection was completely gone. By the way, I have an otoscope at home and was able to track progress everyday. In the same week, I noticed my younger one&#x27;s left ear had some fluid. Again, started using the oil for him and he didn&#x27;t develop anything and also the fluid drained immediately. Since then, everyday I have been using Wally&#x27;s oil once as it also helps with clearing wax and stuff. We recently went for a well visit for my boys and the doctor was very impressed after looking at their ears. She was especially very surpised looking at my elder one&#x27;s ear and commented that it looked very clean and clear. We have seen consistent results with this product and have always recommended this to family and friends.</li>
    <li> This really smells like garlic. I can smell it on myself. The first time I used it my husband asked what the smell was. Ugh! It seems to be soothing my ears but I just can&#x27;t get over the garlic.</li>
    <li> This is an unfair evaluation, because after I tried the Ear Wax Removal System I didn&#x27;t need this product.  I does have a nice cleansing aroma.</li>
    <li> My ears had been getting red, flaky and itchy recently.  Nothing seemed to stop it, problem was persistent and a doctor visit ended with a shrug \\&quot;wait and see\\&quot;.  My mom recommend this to me so I tried it out.  The problem was all but gone in a week.  If you&#x27;re having a problem like mine give it a try or really any of the other brands as they all have the same ingredients in them.  For application I drop some of the liquid onto a Qtip and just rub it around the outer entrance to my ear as opposed to applying the eye dropper directly to the ear.  I&#x27;m pleased with how it works and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> i do not recommend this.... waste of money. it did not do nothing to my ears.  I should have bought something else</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughters ear infections.  My youngest daughter kept having repeat ear infections and after using these drops, the ear infections haven&#x27;t returned.  My oldest daughter started running a fever &amp; complaining of her ear hurting one weekend so I put drops in it.  Her ear got better and I didn&#x27;t have to take her to the doctor for meds.  So glad I got this!  Truly worth the money!!</li>
    <li> my ears have been plugged and itchy all spring, and I used ear candles and that helped somewhat, but this worked very well. The smell is not my favorite, garlic and eucalyptus and the other herbs are a strange combination, but it works and its non chemical, and that matters more to me.</li>
    <li> My 6 yr old suffered constantly from ear infections and earaches. After reading reviews I decided to give this a try and boy this is great! She was very hesitant with ear drops, lets face it is not a nice feeling, but now she asks for them if she feels that they are starting to bother. She haven&#x27;t got an ear infection since we started with the drops. My babys happy and I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Effective.  My ears tend to itch and build up wax, and this helps.  However, I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the smell.  I can only use it when I don&#x27;t have to leave the house anytime soon, as it smells strongly like a very garlicky salad oil!</li>
    <li> This product really relieves the aging itchy ear without  any side effects; easy to use with great results. Would recommend this  product.</li>
    <li> A MUST before using any wax removal tool.  Soothes itchy or irratatated ear almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I use to always buy this stuff from the whole foods store and I remember a more pleasant smell not it is a harsh garlic smell. While I didn&#x27;t put it in my ear before I was about to go somewhere I really do not now. I still would use it because garlic is good for the body and the oil still helps my ears but I am not happy with the smell.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to compliment my ear candles.  Had never bought ear oil,before.  Some on the market have only 2 essential oils in them and this has 5 different essential oils and other extracts also. What I received has a 2 1/2 year shelf life.  Quick delivery and I am using it and like it.</li>
    <li> If you get swimmers ear then this product is for you. I have been using it since my daughter was small. She had an ear infection every three weeks her first year and this was recommended by a chiropractor and it did the job.</li>
    <li> Maybe this should be a 5-star.  I made a mistake.  This is ear OIL.  Dah!!!  My ear already has oil and wax &amp;#34;junk.&amp;#34;  I needed an ear cleaner.  Ehhh!!</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised, but it smells horrible, with a stale garlic smell. I am not a big fan of this stuff but it gets the job done and it is cheap and relatively natural.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I suffer from constant ear itch and the occasional ear pain. So when I saw this ear oil, I was kind of hesitant. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would really help alleviate the pain or itch. I decided that if all those people gave it such great reviews, I would try it too. I am glad that I did. Now, every time I start getting an itch or a slight pain in my ear, I put some on and within seconds, the pain and/or itch are gone. i highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Throughout the month of November I suffered from 5 separate ear infections. After going to the doctor twice and getting put on 3 different antibiotics one of my friends told me to get sweet oil. I could not find sweet oil by itself, but I did find Wally&#x27;s Ear Oil. After I used this oil in my ears I did not have any more ear infections! I had a friend who was suffering from a ear infection that would not go away, once she tried this stuff she was ear infection free! This stuff worked faster then the antibiotics that I was given. From this point on this will be my first solution to ear infections!</li>
    <li> I have 3 Dachshunds, and one of them is prone to have mites; this product takes care of that very quickly.  I also use it when I have earaches.  Have been using Wally&#x27;s for about 12 years now.</li>
    <li> Every time our toddler seems to be getting flu-ish symptoms we use some of these drops.  She hates it, but together with our prayers and massaging  her ears, we have been able to control the ear infections, and avoid the tubes.</li>
    <li> I had heard that this product works really well and was highly recommended to me.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t confirm whether it works or not - my daughter went berserk when I tried the drops on her.  She is very sensitive to smells and hated the garlic odor, which is very strong.</li>
    <li> This Wally&#x27;s ear oil is a favorite product of mine!  I keep it in my medicine cabinet for PRN use.  I used Wally&#x27;s ear candles several  years back and that&#x27;s how I found out about this product.  Works great on the few occasions I get an ear ache and I find it very soothing and dependable.  I just place a drop or two of the oil in my ear with my head tilted to the side and then place a little cotton ball in the opening to keep the oil in the ear canal and repeat (with one or both ears) as needed.  I&#x27;m not sure about shelf life, yet I find it keeps for a long time.  Check with the company if you have questions about expiration date, etc.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I started reading online about people with ear problems and found this brand of ear oil. All the reviews were top notch. I bought a bottle and am now on my second one. Do your own search- this is the one you want.</li>
    <li> I would give this 5 stars but I hate the garlic smell.  Way too overpowering.  I decided to go back to using olive oil instead.  I would buy this again if they get rid of the garlic.</li>
    <li> Did not help with my ear issues and could NOT tolerate the smell of the garlic oil. Sticking with DermOtic oil.</li>
    <li> Works for me in two days when I have itchy, irritated ears.  It&#x27;s thick stuff.  A bit too expensive in my book, but I would buy it again.  Don&#x27;t forget to shake it--that will minimize the garlic smell some.  I find the smell strong enough that I&#x27;ll only use this at night.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like garlic at work.</li>
    <li> Completely got rid of the mites in my dog&#x27;s ear.</li>
    <li> The ear oil works as well as expected, but no better nor worse than any over-the-counter earache drops; eg, Samilison&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> MY SON SUFFERS FROM EARS INFECTIONS EVERYOTHER MONTH,&lt;br /&gt;I USE THIS PRODUCT IN THE NIGHT BEFORE HE GOES TO BED, AND IN 2 DAYS TIME&lt;br /&gt;THE INFECTION IS COMPLETELY GONE, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ANY DRUGS OR MEDS....&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!!!!!!!!11</li>
    <li> With a child getting frequent ear infections, I used this ear oil as soon as my child got a cold to ward off infections. It does provide ear pain relief (per an adult) and has &#x27;cured&#x27; a few minor ear infections (no antibiotics). I am not saying it cures ear infections, nor to avoid antibiotics should the pediatrician recommend. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Years ago I bought this product from a store.  It was a great product that worked.  It smelled more like a pleasant tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil smell.  The next bottle was a little bit different in the listing of ingredients and did not work quite as well, but still was useful. The smell was a little milder but still pleasant.  This is the third bottle I have purchased, and the only bottle purchased from Amazon.  It stinks like garlic and is not the same as the first great bottle I purchased years ago.  I can&#x27;t use it like before because I don&#x27;t want to go to work stinking like offensive garlic. The garlic smell is noticeable to other people.  My husband could smell it. When it smelled like tea tree oil, I liked it better because that is not an offensive smell to most people.  If I had known the formula had changed to smell like garlic, I would not have bought it.  It is such a disappointment for this previous customer that the formula was changed to stinky garlic.  The first bottle was a wonderful relief for ear troubles that come about periodically.  This new bottle makes me wish I had not bought it,  but I thought I was getting what I bought before.  I can&#x27;t use because of the super stinky smell of it.  Maybe the hand mixing of the product does not yield the same product every time.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2+ years with great success at warding off ear infections for my daughter.  I needed to order a new bottle and received it.  Oh my word, it STINKS!  It smells terribly rancid/foul.  Yet the expiration date says 2016.  Oh my word.  I can&#x27;t say how bad it smells.  I am in touch with Amazon about it.  But I think someone seriously messed up with the storage of this product that made it sour terribly, OR sadly the formula was changed and it smells horrendous now.  How terribly frustrating either way.  Ugh.  My stomach turns to smell it.  If you used to buy this and need a new bottle, beware, it may be rather off-putting.  If you get a pleasant smelling bottle of this, count yourself fortunate.  That stuff is awesome to work with and does help tremendously with little ears.  Sadly, I may have to figure out how to make my own or look elsewhere for a different product.  I can&#x27;t bear to use this on my kiddos.  If there was any error that is resolved and I get a sweeter smelling bottle, I&#x27;ll be sure to update.</li>
    <li> So long story short we had two ear Infections in a row a penicillin allergic child and I knew more infections to come. From my first child I know once there is one there is a string of them.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product and bought it on amazon. For the price of a dose of antibiotics at that. One day two weeks after the last ear infection battle my 15 month baby boy came down w a fever and was rubbing his ears. It was sat afternoon so I figured I&#x27;d try it and if he was still sick Monday morning I&#x27;d take him back to the pediatrician. Twice sat and the fever broke Saturday late evening. Twice Sunday and he was acting totally fine. Then once a day until Wednesday. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Now every time he is rubbing an ear and acting off we give him a few days of drops and if he&#x27;s in a pool I give him drops that night as a precautionary measure. It&#x27;s been 2 months and NO ear infections.&lt;br /&gt;I wish drs would admit that there is something  safer and better available. The dr we saw at his last check up would not even say the drops probably worked when the proof was so obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it smells like garlic and onion spaghetti sauce and at first they fight you tooth nail fist and foot!! But the smell is small potatoes compared to the benefits!!!!!! And now he just sort of  protests a minute then he lets us put them in no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I only have 4 stars as we have yet to really test it enough. I may bump it up of lasts the test of time.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but this has garlic oil in it and I could not stand the aroma that lingered along with me. It definitely cured the itching in my ears (I have eczema in my ear canals), but be warned about the smell. I thought I&#x27;d use this daily until the itching cleared more and then apply as needed, but I only use it when it&#x27;s very itchy due to the garlic.</li>
    <li> This ear oil is the best we have used! Since discovering my child is allergic to penicillin products, we are very careful to treat ears when there is the slightest big of congestion. Between prevention treatment with this oil and massaging, we&#x27;ve warded off ear infections for 2 years!!</li>
    <li> The oil helped me with the ear infection, very soothing for the irritated and itchy ears. Smells like herbs and garlic. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Typical scenario, our baby was getting ear infection almost to the point of tubes (yikes) and after Rx number 3 round 3 on same diagnostic I decided to go all natural and do further research on alternative ways to help baby&#x27;s ear. I came across this product on a blog, and was a bit skeptical but once it arrived and it was put to use it REALLY DID WORK! My only regret is not buying it sooner. It usually works within 24-48 hrs (just a few drops throughout day) and viola no more antibiotics. When we take her to pediatricians the doctor is always amazed at how much better her ears look. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help take the itching out of my ears but It really didn&#x27;t help me. Was very oil/greasy</li>
    <li> Mix 1 part rubbing alcohol with one part vinegar and put in baby bottle and dispense into your ear, babies ear whoever is in need.  One kills the bacteria and one dries it out.  I got ear infections all throughout childhood from swimming in the pool and finally a doc told me that she puts this mixture in her bassett hounds ear (yes, a dog) for their infections.  I am now 34 and I now use it on myself and my kids any time we go in a lake or pool, knock on wood, haven&#x27;t had one since!!!</li>
    <li> I use it to help with wax removal and general ear comfort&lt;br /&gt;Has a slight aroma that I hoped would keep the deer flies away.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe in the next release</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product. My Mom picked up a bottle and I&#x27;ve used it in my ears and my daughters for a couple of years. I&#x27;ve also used it on cuts and scraps and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;However, this Labor Day weekend has sold me. The PA weather is hot and humid and allergies are terrible. My ears have been clogged and I woke up yesterday morning with my right ear hurting. I took a decongestant, but the pain got worse. We have picnics and plans this weekend and I thought for sure that I was going to end up in urgent care for an ear infection. I used the ear oil yesterday and, this morning, woke up with no pain at all. I put it in 3 or 4 times a day and let it sit for a while before draining. I have it in right now and will continue to use it for a couple of days to make sure I beat the infection.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Wally&#x27;s for saving me our $25 copay at urgent care, the cost of an antibiotic, and our weekend plans!</li>
    <li> Great product for all minor ear irritations. I also use it on my German Shepherd to naturally kill funky ear smell. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Great Price and good quality.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff I have found that relieves the itching inside my ear. A couple of drops on a Q-tip and a gentle wipe is all it takes. My only issue is that is smells like garlic.  The smell dissipates after a while - so no harm no foul.</li>
    <li> My four year old daughter had eight ear infections in six months and her doctor said she HAD to get tubes put in her ears. After some research I decided to discontinue all medication, start using probiotics and try Wally&#x27;s Ear Oil. In the past year she has gotten one ear infection and I just treated it with Wally&#x27;s and it went away in two days. The ear oil eased her pain right away and then her body was able to fight the infection since she has not been on antibiotics for a year. We also stopped eating dairy, which helped a lot. She no longer takes allergy meds, she does not need an inhaler or nebulizer, no cough medicine, no ibuprofin for ear pain, and best of all no antibiotics.  She is healthier than ever without the constant medications. When she gets a cold and has excess drainage, I just use Wally&#x27;s oil for a few days and it keeps her from getting an ear infection. I can not recommend this product enough. Our bottle does have a garlic smell but it is not overwhelming and I only use it on her at night and after school. The smell is gone by morning. I would not want to send her to school smelling of garlic. I do cover her pillowcase to keep the oil from ruining it. I love this stuff. Oh, it also worked on my 19 year old in two days time. No more nasty antibiotics!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years now.  The first time I used it I was in a store and my ears were itching terribly.  I had another product that I used with me as well as Wally Ear Oil out in the car . The other product did nothing, made them itch worse , so I ran out to get the new oil by Wally.  As soon as I put it in my ear, the itching stopped. I think I have yeast in my ears cause sometimes I itch like an old dog LOL .     I just put it in my cats ears tonight , but only in one ear, in the other I just cleaned it . The ear mites he has are terrible,  as soon as I clean it, the next night they are back .   The cat was itching in the other ear but not in the ear that I put Wally ear oil in it . I call it Wally&#x27;s , don&#x27;t know which  name is correct.   I will put some in the other ear the next night,  I was a little hesitant because I&#x27;ve read that tea tree oil is very bad for cats .   I washed the area around the ear and dried it with a paper towel , I hope he will be O.k.      But I know it works for me and it&#x27;s great stuff.  Let&#x27;s just hope it works  as good for kitty.  I will post update.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;i received the item before the actual delivery and was very pleased. The item was as described,it does smell really bad.lol...I have only used it once and plan to use it again. I put the wax oil inside my ear(hoping to loosen the wax) and waited a while and then cleaned my ears afterward with a ear syringe to clear the ear wax out. I think the combination worked well.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Really nice stuff. All natural.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old has ear infection problems so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  I haven&#x27;t taken him to the dr. to check his ears yet, but it seems to be working!  And he likes the drops too which is surprising.  My major complaint is the bottle... the dropper inside comes loose from the top and you have to replace it constantly.  It is just really leaky overall, but good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at great price</li>
    <li> Works ok as long as the ear infection is not advanced</li>
    <li> Just like I remember. Super helpful!</li>
    <li> This product works and I use it for my 2 year old and myself; mainly needed it for just keeping ear infections away. The result: No ear infections!</li>
    <li> We ran out of a bottle purchased a few years ago and purchased a new one. The smell of the oil in the new bottle is a lot more stinky and unpleasant even though it has the same ingredients. But it works well so we won&#x27;t switch.</li>
    <li> Did not seem to do anything to help my tinnitus. Also, it has an odor that is not horrible, but is not pleasant either.</li>
    <li> LOVED your ear oil!  I have suffered from ear infections since I was a child.  For some reason, when I swim or are exposed to very windy and cold weather, I get terrible ear aches.  I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works without me having to rush to the emergency room for antibiotics!  THANK YOU so very much for creating this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> My family &amp; I have used Wally&#x27;s Ear Oil for YEARS and have recommended it to friends. It works!  Please note that I am referring to Wally&#x27;s ALL NATURAL Ear Oil....NOT Wally&#x27;s ORGANIC Ear Oil.  I accidentally purchased the organic and discovered the ingredients where very different and quickly returned it.  Wally&#x27;s All Natural DOES stink but it is for your ears and trust me, you won&#x27;t mind when your ears feel better.  This is a PREVENTION so if you have a severe ear infection...go to the DR!  This gets rid of swimmer&#x27;s ear  &amp; itchy ears almost immediately (in our experience)  I have used it in my pet&#x27;s ears when needed too!  Great stuff.  NOTE:  Don&#x27;t always assume this product will last as long as exp date...like any oil, discard if it starts to smell rancid.  P.S. The All Natural actually has organic ingredients too, it is just not certified organic. (check Wally&#x27;s website)</li>
    <li> stronnng garlic smell. Not like our last maybe this was older or maybe newer i dont know! we use it regardless the stench and it knocks out ear wax and keeps the ear infections at bay. use it on the whole family. 1 year and up!</li>
    <li> I wish I was as lucky as some of the other users of this ear oil, but unfortunately it only made me smell garlicky. I had a stubborn ear blockage for well over a month- this started off as an ordinary water clog that went on to ache, ofcourse I had wax build up. I used this for 7 days, every night before I slept and nothing drained out and my ear was still silent. Then I changed tactics to putting 3-4 drops of warm olive oil 3 nights in a row and on the 4th day, my cotton bud scooped it all out (yuck). My ear has been fine ever since! I&#x27;d suggest you try plain old olive oil before putting down your money for this &#x27;ear oil&#x27;!</li>
    <li> We tried this oil after my son(3yrs) got recurring ear infection (6 rounds of antibiotic).  We were told to go for surgery, instead we used this finally.  We used to put 3-4drops oil twice a day  and when he used to sleep that time we used to do little hot pack/warm cloth below his ear for 5-6 mins each ear. After 2-3 days there was no infection and not appeared for till now(1yr touchwood).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say ,regularly check with doctor and put the oil only if there is no eardrum rupture or discharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( u can by it from any local natural product store too.)</li>
    <li> The product might work just fine but it came with no directions and I&#x27;m a bit reluctant to blindly put liquid into my ear</li>
    <li> I had some irritation in my ear that wouldn&#x27;t go away. In fact it seemed to be getting worse. Many years ago it was possible to find simple products in the drug store that solved a simple problem, but no longer. Discovered this on Amazon and it seemed to be like a product from long ago. Bought it. Tried it. Liked it. It works. The relief was almost immediate. The oil began soothing the irritation. And shortly the pain left. Its probably not necessary to mention it. But you should use a small piece of cotton ball in the ear to prevent the oil from leaking out.</li>
    <li> Last year, I used a different ear oil and didn&#x27;t find relief throughout the ordeal I was going through so I decided on this oil due to the reviews I read.  I bought it over the summer in preparation for winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for four days and started at the first sign of discomfort.  Unfortunately, my condition is getting worse!  It is acute pain now.  I am so disappointed, this oil doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for me and my son.  Mostly my son who is disabled and for some reason his ears are always dirty (like he has dirt faries in his pillow) I was hesitant about cleaning someone elses ears so I ordered this and the syringe. Now my son&#x27;s has very clean ears and so do I. This product is easy to use and gentle.</li>
    <li> I have used this product once so far when my toddler was complaining of an ear ache. She had just had an ear infection a few weeks before and I wanted to prevent round two of antibiotics. I put the drops in her ears twice a day for two days and she never complained of ear pain again. I will definitely be keeping this in the medicine cabinet as a first resort before going to the doctor or considering antibiotics.</li>
    <li> I started using this years ago to help ease my ear discomfort. Read somewhere I could use it on my dogs as well. I have two small dogs who frequently have ear issues and a few drops of this seems to offer some relief.</li>
    <li> I rellly like this product it works well and  the bottle and the droper are very well made. i love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow, this product works, I had this sharp pain in my ear, I prayed and used this, viola pain is gone.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to re-affirm what other buyers have said…this stuff smells TERRIBLE! I was only able to us it in one ear. I couldn&#x27;t use it in the other because the first ear smelled so terrible. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because the ear I used it in seems to feel better than the other, but surely there&#x27;s something else that works as well without making you sick to your stomach. It&#x27;s not just the garlic smell, I could tolerate that, but the combination of ingredients produced a smell that&#x27;s far worse than garlic alone. And the smell lasts and lasts and get on your fingers when you try to clean it off.</li>
    <li> My daughter had itchy ears and this has helped her with that and the wax build up. It has worked great for her.</li>
    <li> This is better than the ear drops from the local pharmacy for sure!  I do like that it helps when my ears are feeling effected by my sinus congestion when I get sick.  I only took a star away because they aren&#x27;t AMAZING.  They are helpful, yes, but they aren&#x27;t a cure or anything.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend and even let them borrow mine because there is plenty and a little goes a long, long way!</li>
    <li> ****Update:It&#x27;s now been 2 years since I first tried wallys. This product has changed ingredients since, it does smell much more like garlic. The bulb top tends to wear out before my bottle is empty, and i learned it is best to store it with no oil sucked into the dropper, the essential oils in it will ruin the eye dropper top. However you can easily buy replacement dropper tops for cheap. I have been able to use this oil on ear aches and it helps immediately, and the time i put alcohol in my ear for swimmers ear my ear stung badly, and this worked right away. We have successfully warded off ear infections by using this consistently, and the times we did get ear infections we were able to avoid a trip to the doctor by using this and clearing things up in a few days. ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing. I have eczema in the ears and wake up with wet ears constantly, itchy all day, worse with my sinus problems. This product has helped my ears so much. It soothes, I use it after I peroxide my ears and I have not gotten an infection in 2 months. This product does not irritate my ears at all, and helps with itchiness, and takes away my ear pain immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t warm the product up but a few drops at room temperature does not make me dizzy, which is great because most products do. I warmed it once by letting the bottle sit in some hot water for about 2 minutes and then tested it on my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any build up or pain of any sort and it has reduced the ear aches I get when going outside in the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an eye dropper and I use 2 drops in my ears and I let it sit for 5-10 minutes and then let it drain out and go to sleep. I have fallen asleep with the drops in my ear which eventually came out as I turned in my sleep but did not cause any negative affect on my ears. I use it once or twice daily and a bottle lasts me 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus it makes your ears smell great. I think it&#x27;s the eucalyptus but they are left with a nice fresh minty smell. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go without this stuff. If you are looking for a product that with sooth a wide variety of ear problems this is the one. I have tried many others and most irritated my ears. Even better is that the essential oils in it are anti viral and anti fungal to a degree, which is a little added protection against sickness.eft with a nice fresh minty smell.

    <li> only used this product once and i didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my ear discomfort. haven&#x27;t used it again.it should&#x27;nt matter how many words i use to describe or rate this product, just what i think of it. who&#x27;s idea is it to measure words.</li>
    <li> I live in Colorado, so the insides of my ears frequently dry out and start to itch. I&#x27;ve heard about the dangers of getting a q-tip lodged in your ear, and while they often satisfy the immediate itch they don&#x27;t solve the actual problem of dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ear oil turned out to be a life-saver; just dropping a couple drops into my ears in the morning of a dry day will have me set for a couple weeks. (It&#x27;s best not to do it before bed, if you sleep on your side, as it will seep onto your pillow.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad actually bought me my first bottle a couple years ago, and it looks small, but since I don&#x27;t have to use it very frequently, it&#x27;s lasted a very long time. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, and they&#x27;ve changed the packaging, but I haven&#x27;t had to clean my ears more thoroughly than a rinse in the shower for months, so I can tell it&#x27;s still the same great product.</li>
    <li> Weird in a good sense . I have had ringing in my ears for years , so i ordered Clear Tinnitus ( Capsules ) and Wally&#x27;s Ear Oil at the same time . I also ordered Ring Stop ( Drops ) . One week in to using the Capsules twice a day and the Ring stop drops i lost my hearing almost completely in my left Ear from the Ring stop drops hardening in my left ear . The ringing was still there . I was able to remove the gook from my ear . Then after a few days i started using Wally&#x27;s Ear Oil( because of the healing affect) and it seems like all at once the ringing was cut in half in the next 2 day&#x27;s after i started using Wally&#x27;s . Also my Ears felt really good . Then experimented with stopping the Capsules for a few days and the ringing was getting stronger . Now i leave things alone and take 2 Capsules of Ring Stop per day and a cotton swap with a drop of Wally&#x27;s in both of my ears and I&#x27;m happy .</li>
    <li> I use this oil each time before I dive and then after each dive.  I used to get ear infections after diving but this oil has stopped all my ear issues.  Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I like it, but wish it didn&#x27;t have to be refrigerated! That is the only con. It worked very well tight out of the package. The second use, I had to warm the bottle with warm water since it was so cold.</li>
    <li> This really helped my ears! I felt like pressure and they hurt a bit. I tried this for 4 days and it was like a major ear cleansing! I recommend it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now, a couple of drops in each ear in the night. Have a half cotton ball to keep the oil in your ear and not on your pillow after you let it set in there a few minutes and then do the other. I can feel some healing going on, though I think I may need more help than the oil can give.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says.  It works well and will continue using it.  I just have to make sure I use it when I am going to be at home, since it has a strong bad smell to it.  I also found that if you apply to a q-tip and very gently apply it to your ear the smell and taste are not as strong.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love all-natural products and was eager to try this based on the positive reviews.  It really is soothing to sore ears, and it helped ease the pain I was feeling during a recent sinus infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the garlic oil that is used as one of the ingredients is so strong that it literally almost caused me to get sick to my stomach.  It&#x27;s the last ingredients on the list, but the strongest smell, and it doesn&#x27;t dissipate at all.  Since the oil stays outside your ear a bit, I kept getting the oil&#x27;s smell on my fingers when I rubbed the exterior of my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong but it&#x27;s so overpowering for me that I think I may just end up throwing this out since I&#x27;m not sure how hygienic it would be to give it to someone else.  It&#x27;s a good product, but the smell makes it un-usable for me.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful . . . Feels warm and cozy when you drop it in the ear canal.  However, for someone with a tendancy to severe swimmers ear, this just adds moisture, and aggravates the issue!</li>
    <li> We use this stuff in our daughters&#x27; ears when they have ear infections, and although I can&#x27;t provide proof, it works! And does a much better (and safer) job than antibiotics. Our youngest one is allergic to penicillin and amoxicillin, and we really depend on this for removing the infections when she gets them. It&#x27;s also good for infections caused by scratches and whatever else. Great stuff, and as long as they keep making it, we&#x27;ll keep buying and using it.</li>
    <li> I have never used anything like this before and it does work.  I have even used it on my dog.&lt;br /&gt;I just have to remember more is not always better!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this to go more of a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; route....I&#x27;m not sure if it works, but the smell is awful!!  The garlic smell is very overwhelming!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I ordered this, it is such a cleansing sensation that I advise anybody else to buy this. I am an avid swimmer and I always have problems with ear infections. Not any more.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the ear oil yet.  I am using up a bottle of something else.  Ask me in a couple of months</li>
    <li> This is obviously one of those products that works well for some people, not so well for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dealt with excessive ear wax for a number of years, and recently my doctor recommended this product as an aid in preventing build-up.  Two weeks later I was back in his office in severe pain due to a double ear infection (inner &amp; outer ear) and am currently on my second round of ear drops and oral antiobiotics to treat the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more Wally&#x27;s for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if another ear oil would have worked better, but I&#x27;ll stick with Wally&#x27;s.  I put it in my ear once or twice a day for three days and then I used an ear irrigation kit and couldn&#x27;t believe all of the wax that had been soften and left my ear.  Wally&#x27;s plus the irrigation system did the trick!!</li>
    <li> I wear hearing aids in both ears and this year has been just awful with the &#x27;itch&#x27;! My doctor suggested olive oit but I found this and my ears had cleared up in three days! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and great packaging.  The only complain I have is the residue it leaves behind and how hard is to clean it off.  I scratch my ear canal trying to clean it and got an outer ear infection which is very painful, so be careful.  It does provide relief to the itchiness.</li>
    <li> This oil works so well and has no chemicals or drugs in it!  We use it for our dogs and our humans.  Amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> ALWAYS knocks an earache out in a couple hours for my family of eight.&lt;br /&gt;Never have to go to the doctor &amp; it has always worked, VERY QUICKLY!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years! Works great for sore ears, and I trust the ingredients. Lower price here than stores</li>
    <li> My 3 year old has suffered from many internal ear infections and had ear tubes. Then he started swim lessons and had an external ear infection so I decided to try this about a year ago and since then he has been fine. No ear infections of any kind. Is it a coincidence or is it this oil? I am not sure but I will keep on using it. I usually use 3 drops per ear. He likes it and that is great. The garlic smell is a bit overwhelming but I apply it at night and the next morning the smell is gone.So far so good.</li>
    <li> My ENT gave me a prescription for very expensive drops to moisturize my ears. I filled the prescription, it worked great, but a tiny bottle for $60 was just too much so I started looking for a replacement. This is my replacement and it works great. My only comment on this product is it smells like Vics Vapor Rub, but a strong smell is definitely worth the difference in price.</li>
    <li> My son started getting ear infection when he was 14 months old in April 2012. Doc prescribed antibiotic we gave him for 10 days and on 12th day he had infection again, The doc prescribed another antibiotic for 10 days, this happened 4 times so basically our son was on antibiotic for 2 months till June 2012. Then the doc prescribed us getting the tubes, we tried to get the ENT appt, but could not get one for 2 weeks, I did not want to start another antibiotic. I started searching online for home remedies and came across Wallys ear oil. I also tried putting baked onion vapours in his ears and gave him warm massage on the ears but it did not help. I started using Wallys ear oil from June and we did not get an ear infection till today. But the fluid was not draining, I tried Osteopathic massage and also&lt;br /&gt;took him to chiropractics, but the fluid was not draning. The ENT advised us to get tubes so that his hearing does not get affected due to the tubes. We did get tubes and the ENT doc said that there was thick fluid in both ears. I am glad we got tubes, but I think that had we used wallys ear oil right from the first time he got infection, the fluid might have not gotten so thick so as to not drain at all. Anyways, I recommend this oil, it has prevented ear infections for me, it might do so for you too and there are no side effects, so there is no harm in trying.</li>
    <li> We are first time users of Wally&#x27;s Natural Ear Oil Liquid and my husband and I give it a thumbs up without any reservations.  My husband has a chronic problem of ear wax that has to be coaxed out and ear oil with a bulb to irrigate the ear gets the wax plug out almost efortlessly. The product was packaged very well so no breakage or leaks and it arrived within estimated delivery time.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with itchy ears for a long time.  I kept trying to stop the itching with liquid ear wax remover, but all it did was make the problem worse.  Thankfully, I found this ear oil.  Just put a few drops in each ear, let sit for a couple of minutes, and then tilt my head the other way to let the excess drain out.  It is designed to help your ear wax work its way out of your ear canal naturally (apparently, when the wax gets hard, it is going nowhere and makes your ear itchy).  The oil smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (October 2013):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased another bottle of Wally&#x27;s Ear Oil.  It still works very well, but they have apparently added garlic oil to the formula, which leaves a revolting smell.  I don&#x27;t understand why they made this change, unless it was to save money.  I will still use it, but is is not as pleasant as before.</li>
    <li> My daughter had some wax build up that seemed to bother her. I used this on her a couple times and she no longer grabs or scratches at her ears! I just put some on a q-tip and held it to the opening of ear canal (just so it wouldn&#x27;t be too much). She didn&#x27;t mind it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years. One bottle lasts a couple of years. I use it on myself, children and husband. It is great for minor earaches, itchy ears, dry ears. You feel the difference immediately!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it whenever I feel ear infection coming on, and ha e had great results. My kids love it too.</li>
    <li> It works almost as good as it used to, but it smells like garlic now, they must have changed the formula. I loved it before, but I don&#x27;t think it works a good as it used to, and now it stinks for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product works way better then the doctor prescribed ear drops.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for some time for a product for my ear. I had caught a cold in my ear during this winter. I had tried other products locally but to no avail. This product after a couple of treatments gave me the relief that I had been seeking. I no longer feel any ill affects.</li>
    <li> We use it for the whole family.</li>
    <li> My doctor suggested I use sweet oil for itchy ears.  I tried this, but, unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t help me.  In fact, unfortuantely, my ears really  bother me at night.  ENT is next stop for me!</li>
    <li> I wanted this ear oil to work, I really did. Everyone under the sun recommended it to me when I mentioned my ear issues, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my ears REALLY itchy after using it, and itchiness was a problem I didn&#x27;t have beforehand. I stopped using it and tried again a few days later and the itchiness came back, so I&#x27;m obviously sensitive to one of the ingredients. Aside from the fact that it kept vampires away (because of the very strong garlic smell!), sadly it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> This is the good bottle! I have used Wally&#x27;s for 8 years now. I purchased it with my first son for whenever he might get water in his ears or for the occasional ear infection and have used it ever since. The most recently purchased bottle was different. It had a different smell, which was not as pleasant as the one I had previously purchased. Then I noticed it was organic, which in itself is not bad. However a few of the ingredients changed and possibly even the amounts of some of the others. They have always had garlic, which seems to dominate the scent of the newer bottle. The new organic Walley&#x27;s is made with olive oil and lavender oil vs. sweet almond oil and eucalyptus oil. I&#x27;ve heard the order of the ingredients dictate the amount in greatest to smallest. If that&#x27;s true then the older version had a higher amount of tea tree oil than Mullein extract. The older version also had echinacea oil vs echinacea extract. I believe the echinacea oil and eucalyptus oil did a far better job of dominating the scent of garlic, than the lavender oil and echinacea extract. I will ensure I check ingredients on the next bottle.</li>
    <li> Had severe pain in my ear one day, I used this and a day or 2 later it dislodged a tiny tick.  I have no idea how long it had been in there (yes, it was dead)  My husband is trying it for his tinnitus; will report back and let you know if it works.  From everything I&#x27;ve read, it will depend on what has caused his tinnitus as there seems to be a few different way to get it.</li>
    <li> Jury still out. Will have to wait and see but love that it is all natural just as God gave us to heal our every ill.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and it has been great for my family.  The company even called to make sure I got the product and how I was liking it.  Great service!</li>
    <li> Wow does this stuff stink!  Stopped using it I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  Wound not buy this again for sure.</li>
    <li> I had to put all caps in my title.  For the last 4 months I have had an ear infection affecting my sinuses.  t would be blocked one minute then start to ring then release for a few hours and I would be fatigued with a slight fever.  I tried everything from just garlic oil.  I tried grapefruit seed extract internally and in a base for my ear.  NOTHING worked.  I have no health insurance and was getting desperate.  I heard a lot of people online talk about this oil so I ordered a bottle.  First day I tried it I put 3 drops in my ear...probably too much. But it started doing something in about 15 minutes. It felt like the swelling in my ear moved from the middle of my ear to the canal and I could hear a little better afterwards.  However, that night I got really dizzy and took some Sudafed to help me through the night. Sort of figured I may have done too much.  So the next day I did only 1 drop and held my head down for about 5 minutes.  Felt a little bit of a release in my ear but not much.  Took the next day off and cleaned out my ears with approved ear cleaner liquid and then the next day started with 2 drops.  I put a heat pad on my ear with my ear down so the oil could go deep in my ear for about 10 minutes.  I left it alone the whole day.  3 hours later the ringing and blockage has stopped.  NO results from anything else.  This has got to be some heck of an ear product.  If you have an ear condition this stuff rocks.  THANK YOU WALLY!!!</li>
    <li> Last words the pediatrician told us was that if this next round of antibiotics, 5 round, didn&#x27;t work he would need to go to an ENT and get ear tubes. I was freaked out because I&#x27;ve seen my son go down before and I couldn&#x27;t let that happen again. I found Wally&#x27;s ear oil her on amazon and here I am!!! They worked and my son enjoys getting them put into his ears. I just came back today from the pediatrician and she told us that his ears were beautiful!!!!!!!!! I just started using them but it fixed my problem, now I plan to use them at least before bed, prior to the morning and night ritual. This product avoided my son getting ear tubes put in and for that I thank you!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I had high hopes!  I must have an allergy, my ears didn&#x27;t clear up at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product due to others positive opinions. After using a few drops &amp; flushing with ear syringe &amp; water, it DID dislodge my ear wax but my hearing continued to be muffled. Doctor said my ear was perfectly clear. Now I was worried. The only thing I did different was use this new product. It WAS very oily so on a hunch, I put a few drops of peroxide in my ear for a few minutes. Directly after I emptied out the peroxide, I could hear again. All I can deduce is that the peroxide removed left-over oil film from this product. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I will never use it again.</li>
    <li> My ears use to itch so bad.  I went to my doctors and purchased a prescription oil for my ears.  It semi-worked but I knew the ingredients wasn&#x27;t something I should continue to be using over the long haul.  I did research, and decided to purchased this product.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  Great ingredients: Sweet almond oil, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, mullein extract, echinacea oil and garlic oil and I get relief from these oils.  Although my ear still itches, but not as frequent, I know I&#x27;m not doing my body any harm with these ingredients.  I believe once I get my humidifier going my ears wouldn&#x27;t be so dry.</li>
    <li> I use this oil at the first sign of irritation (throat and ears).  It works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> These were purchased for a friend who said they worked amazingly quickly for her ear infection / pain. Yay for a quick herbal remedy!</li>
    <li> It did help with my itchy ears, but didn&#x27;t help when I tried to use the syringe but its soothing</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help as hoped but then maybe my expectations were too high.  it was worth a try any way.</li>
    <li> this is great to keep the ear from drying out and flaking if or when you scratch it. I like Wally&#x27;s products and use them frequently.</li>
    <li> Product is good for calming ear irritation but the smell and oily texture takes some getting used to. Will continue to use</li>
    <li> I had a problem with a clogged ear, and Wally&#x27;s was recommended to me to help clear the ear. However, when I got this product and used it, it ended up being an oily mess and didn&#x27;t help whatsoever. If anything, my ear felt more clogged! I don&#x27;t recommend this for a clogged ear at all. I know it has other uses, and I have no comment on those. I&#x27;m sure it is good for something. It is just way too messy and unhelpful for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having some ringing in my ears lately.  Particularly with my left ear.  Normally I clean my ears once or twice a year with Hydrogen Peroxide but I decided to try some Ear Oil instead as I figured it was more gentle.  There aren&#x27;t really any directions other than shake well and apply as needed.  I put some in and basically got oily ears and somewhat muted hearing.  After a week what I decided to do was do my normal routine of clean with hydrogen peroxide, flush gently with warm water, then a couple drops of oil and another flush with some water and towel off the outside.  That seems to have gotten rid of the ringing for the most part and I can hear a litte better.  The one annoying thing, was the cap didn&#x27;t seal well so when I first opened the bottle I got oily hands.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this oil as it&#x27;s very gentle and smells nice.  I would just prefer some more detailed instructions.</li>
    <li> This smells so bad I really can&#x27;t stand to use it.  It did work all right when I did use it, but it&#x27;s just so so bad smelling.  Mostly I smell onions and garlic, which are two things I can&#x27;t stand the smell of.  If you do use it only use it the comfort of your home, not when you are going out unless you want everyone to side eye you.  I&#x27;m going to have to search for something else.  Still giving it 3 stars because it does work somewhat and it would be fine for your cats and dogs.</li>
    <li> My daughter began using Wally&#x27;s Ear Oil when my oldest grandson was 3 &amp; suffering from frequent earaches.  Using Wally&#x27;s oil after baths or swimming has prevented trips to the doctor for him.  I am a swimmer &amp; have had problems in the past removing water from my ears.  Now I use a couple drops before swimming &amp; have had no problem with water draining since.  It&#x27;s also wonderful to help keep ear wax from building up.  And it&#x27;s natural, with no chemical additives.  Safe for babies, kids &amp; adults.&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product.</li>
    <li> My moms ears have been itching so bad and getting sores in her ears because of our water.  When she used this after two days, no more dryness, itching or sores.  thank you so much</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do so that is enough for me to like. I used it a few times.</li>
    <li> As so many others have said, this product STINKS!!! I smell like I&#x27;ve got crushed garlic in my ear, so there is no way I can use this stuff at any time other than bedtime. But the oil seems to be helping me avoid both wax buildup and recurring ear infections due to a chronically perforated eardrum. If I can avoid using antibiotic so frequently, I&#x27;ll be quite satisfied. But peeee-uuuuuuu!!</li>
