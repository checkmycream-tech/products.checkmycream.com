<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> has a terrible smell. ive used it for 2 weeks now and cant really see any change yet. hopefully i&#x27;ll see some improvements soon.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It absorbs into my skin quickly and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s softer and it also minimizes the appearance of acne scars. I use it twice a day. I also bought a bottle for my sister and she&#x27;s noticed a change in her face also.  I will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> Dried my skin...very unhappy with it.  Did not do what it claimed... I would never recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed withamazon for selling this product.</li>
    <li> Like it but no results yet maybe a little longer then u see the results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle! Love the way this product makes my skin feel and look. It&#x27;s light weight absorbs readily and is so good for the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin tone has become more even and smooth. I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> Have only used for a short while but my skin feels softer and certainly less dry.</li>
    <li> It is OK haven&#x27;t noticed any great difference yet.</li>
    <li> Love this product.....just ordered more for when I run out. Feels so good on your skin and dries quickly</li>
    <li> I use this product for two months, it reduced the sun damaged skin by 50%.  It takes patience, but I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Product really works.  I&#x27;ve been in cosmetics industry for 15 years and it&#x27;s been a long time a product has worked this well. I&#x27;m 63 years old so when a product works I&#x27;m excited.</li>
    <li> Horrible watery product  no oily like expected it burned my face  does describe no to use if have sensitive or psoriasis  Never again then is water not oily or thick with dropper  do t get</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite vitamin c serum just the right consistency. My skin craves this and just literally drinks it in.my skin looks amazing since using, am on my 2nd bottle.LOVE</li>
    <li> IT WORKS ! This is the first product I have tried that actually works. I have been using it for several days and there really is a lessening of that  wrinkly look on my cheeks and upper lip. My advice...try it..follow the directions, use twice a day and you will get results. I am one very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I like the serum and hopefully it will improve my skin a little bit. Your skin feels a little bit dry afterwards so I always put face cream on</li>
    <li> Very happy with results of this product..</li>
    <li> I find that it drys out my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now with unbelievable results. My skin feels softer and the significant reduction of wrinkles around my eyes have left me speechless. Definitely recommend this product for everyone out there seeking for a soft radiant skin.</li>
    <li> I so love this serum and use it daily! I have received so many compliments!  Kudos to you!</li>
    <li> I just got this and tried it last night after my shower... Could feel my face tighten ... Love it.  Used it on my hands also and it took away some of the wrinkling on my hands.  I am not that old my hands are showing their age.  Will be purchasing more of this product and will recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Can really tell a difference!</li>
    <li> After a certain age. my sun damaged, tired skin needed all the help it could get. I wasn&#x27;t convinced at first, but over time this fantastic serum has been a godsend.... IT REALLY WORKS,  MY FACE LOOK SMOOTHER AND YOUNGER.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now every night and have not noticed any difference at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every day for a month with no good results</li>
    <li> In just the few weeks I have been using this serum my face does seem brighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> This serum goes on smooth and clear, leaving no oily or greasy residue. It makes my skin feel more moisturized, smooth, and supple! I love the texture, and hydrating effects - plus that it protects my skin from environmental factors. Overall, this serum is a great go-to product!</li>
    <li> Feels good on my face...Very hydrating!</li>
    <li> This is a really great product! It left my skin feeling fresh and best of all it is super easy to use.  Can I just mention how nice looking the bottle is as well. No foul smell of any kind. I had a really positive experience using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It actually works and take it from me....I have tried many. You can&#x27;t beat the price. Give it 30 days and you will see a difference.</li>
    <li> I could not see any change whatever.  Would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I used this every day, after receiving it to review, for about a month. While, I didn&#x27;t see any anti-aging effects (I&#x27;m only 24 and don&#x27;t have any of those concerns yet) I did notice that my face looked brighter and more even toned. I use a pretty heavy facial routine in the evening and it was leaving my face dull and lifeless and this helped to breath in new life to my skin. I would highly recommend trying out this vitamin C serum. I read that it can help with sun protection which is great too, especially since I am photosensitive! There is no weird smell. It comes in a dark bottle designed to protect it from light. Your dispense the serum with a dropper which makes it sanitary, no transfer of bacteria. The shelf life says it is good from two years upon opening, and it will last you at least a year if used once a day...if not longer.</li>
    <li> I have noticed an improvement in my skin and tightening of the fine lines and wrinkled</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic acid works really very well. After even one week you can see a difference in the way your skin and face looks. I am a grandmother of a 20 year old grandchild and my face looks much younger since I have been using this product.&lt;br /&gt; There are a lot of anti aging cream on the market ,much more expansive, and they do not improve your skin or looks much. So I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I can tell the change with my skin and several friend have said &amp;#34; you have done something and you look younger!&amp;#34;  Tell me what woman would not like to be told she looks great and younger?</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after one week.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle- just giving it time to improve my skin even more!</li>
    <li> this serum is a definite re order tightens your skin and gives clarity I am so pleased with results as I finished my first bottle fine lines softened very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a week and have seen a slight difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> The way the product was promoted is not the way I see any results. I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time and I see very little change. I do like the way my skin feel, soft and smooth. The results is still out, I&#x27;m willing to give it some more time.</li>
    <li> Watery consistency, hard to apply. I believe in the technology, but this product had no effect after 1 and 1/2 bottles.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and the results are great.I get compliments all the time.and I make sure to tell my friends what I use and where to find it.Thanks for sharing this product.</li>
    <li> New Radiance Naturals goes on easily with the dropper which is included. I use a drop or two and gently massage it into my face until dry. It sinks deeply into my skin cells and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue. I&#x27;ve it for about four days so far and my face is more radiant and possibly a bit more glowing. My skin feels smooth and I don&#x27;t have any irritation from using it. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results and am going to continue to use it. I received free product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see a difference anywhere but my checking account!</li>
    <li> I feel and see an immediate response to my skin</li>
    <li> no improvement that I can see</li>
    <li> I purchased this to eliminate the dark spots on my face. I started using it last Sept. I applied the serum once in the morning and once in the evening every day. After the first 3 weeks, I noticed a very slight change on one of the dark spots and that was all. I just finished the second bottle a few days ago with no further noticeable changes so I requested a refund. I am so impressed with their fast response that I felt I had to write a review. I emailed my request to the seller today (Sunday!!) and I got a response within 25 min. stating that my order had been refunded. I then received an email from Amazon (about 3 hours later) stating that they were processing the seller&#x27;s refunded to my account. Even though it didn&#x27;t work well with me, I would recommended others to try. The 3-star rating is for the seller&#x27;s seriously impressive customer service. Now I have to try to find another product :(. Just an update: My credit card posted the refund on Monday!!</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve EVER used, and I&#x27;ve tried a TON. It has a really like scent to it, which is nice if you have sensitive skin. I can feel it working on my face right away! It&#x27;s helped with my fine lines, acne, and I feel like I look like 5 years younger after using it a month. Seriously, I thought all Vitamin C serums were essentially the same until I used this one. It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite and the only one I use now!</li>
    <li> Alittle goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used this product for about 1 month now and can&#x27;t really tell a difference yet.</li>
    <li> Same as I said before......take care of yourself....eat healthy.....exercise..... sleep.....don&#x27;t have bad habits.....dont be overweight.......and yes try this......don&#x27;t think it will hurt you.....and when you are 72.....you need some extra help......you are only as old as you choose to be!!!!  I think it does help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually shocked at the results .  I thought my dark spots was just a part of my me, there to stay.  I was wrong , this stuff really works .  I mix it with my coconut oil to cleans my face and moisturize . I also use it alone .  I know I&#x27;ll keep using it and I totally recommend it .</li>
    <li> As someone that is obsessed with using vitamin C serums I was so excited to receive this New Radiance Naturals professional vitamin c serum in the mail!! I&#x27;m always on the look out for my top favorite vitamin c serums and have to say after trying this one out for myself I can say it is an amazing vitamin c serum and it&#x27;s definitely a favorite of mine!! Vitamin c serum is extremely beneficial to your skin as it fades sunspots, reduces discoloration, refines skin texture and reduces lines and wrinkles. It&#x27;s also proven to dramatically increase the production of collagen and cellular turnover, resulting in a much smoother texture and even skin tone!! These are only a plethora of some of the amazing benefits of vitamin c serums there are many other amazing benefits as well!!! This New Radiance Naturals Professional Vitamin C Serum can actually bring back radiance and firmness to your face, and fade wrinkles, lines, freckles, acne scars, discoloration and age spots just by applying it topically!! New Radiance Naturals also use a uniquely stabilized Vitamin C; this is the most bio-available meaning it is absorbed by the skin almost immediately yielding the most dramatic and rapid results!! This vitamin c serum works wonders for your skin and I definitely recommend it to everyone and anyone!!</li>
    <li> Very running, much like water. This also had an off scent that I didn&#x27;t find pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have really noticed a difference in my skin since making the Vitamin C Serum a part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I am seeing slight results not as much as I had expected.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum is one of the hottest new products on the market.  And with good reason; there is strong evidence, including a 2002 study from the NIH, that concluded: “This formulation of vitamin C results in clinically visible and statistically significant improvement in wrinkling when used topically for 12 weeks.”  (See link below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried a number of vitamin C serums, including New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum, and so far I’ve have been very impressed with the results.  It’s designed to reduce fine lines, smooth the skin, clear up acne and make you look younger.  It even held diminish a scar I have on my face from surgery due to skin cancer.  I love the stuff!  Oh yes, and it’s gluten free for those with a gluten-related disorder like celiac disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://theglutenfreeprofessor.com/new-radiance-naturals-vitamin-c-serum/</li>
    <li> the best IMO! and especially for the price - you can&#x27;t beat it...</li>
    <li> I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for about a month now and I like it a lot. It comes in an amber colored glass bottle with glass eye dropper. The serum also doesn&#x27;t have any funky scents; I don&#x27;t notice a scent at all. This is great because it doesn&#x27;t interfere with whatever other products or perfumes I am using that day. I apply the serum once in the morning under my moisturizer and makeup. I also apply it at night under a thicker moisturizer. Both work great and this product hasn&#x27;t messed with my makeup application at all. I love that the serum isn&#x27;t super thick yet isn&#x27;t watered down either. It is a thinner liquid but I can still easily control it. It absorbs amazingly fast which I love. My skin feels so much softer, smoother and more even textured that I find myself wanting to touch my skin throughout the day. Not only has this serum helped with the way my skin feels, but overall I feel like I look better. My skin has much more of a &#x27;glow&#x27; and just looks healthier. This is a serum I&#x27;m enjoying using every day and that makes a difference in my skin. I would suggest checking it out if you need a decent serum containing vitamin c. I did receive a complimentary product for testing purposes. Regardless, my opinions are always completely my own and unbiased.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C serum for about two weeks or so. To be honest I am really impressed how much better her skin is starting to look in such a short period of time. Her dark circles have lightened up a lot, her skin has a nice glow to it, and her age spots are lighter already. Some days she only applies it once in the morning or twice with a night application. She says it absorbs quickly and feels a little tight at first, but it doesn’t last. Here is a pic of her age spots over the past two weeks. I am sure after 12 weeks they will be almost totally gone.</li>
    <li> There are so many facial serums on the market today, it might seem confusing on what product is better for your skin. Well, let me tell you I have been using this Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum for a while now and I see, and feel, the difference in my facial appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wake up in the morning, I dab a bit of serum under my eyes, on my temples, cheeks, chin and neck. If you have ever felt a precious babies skin, this is what your skin will begin to feel like. The day after I put this on my face, I woke up and felt how soft my skin was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial serum really wowed me and it will wow you as well. Being able to apply an organic made facial product is very important for people today, just as it is important to eat and drink a product that is organically grown. Just as it is important to read all ingredients that are in our food and drink products, so to is it important to be able to read and see what ingredients are in our facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum is made with the best natural and organic ingredients and it is made 100% CRUELTY FREE! This company will only use vegan, cruelty-free formulas with active natural/organic ingredients. Plus, if you are not a fan of chemicals such as parabens, sulfates or  gluten, alcohol and phthalates, none of these ingredients are used in making this amazing facial serum. In fact, this serum is 98% natural and 72% organic and 100% plant based. If you are looking to support American made products, that is exactly what the Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum is, Made in the USA in an FDA registered facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, you can not go wrong with this facial serum. I use it in the morning and evening and wow, my face feels softer and looks younger than ever before.</li>
    <li> Can this be used on face with rosacea? Will it help?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on products I buy. But I have used this for about a month now I think.  I really feel there is a difference in my freckles becoming lighter and just the overall skin tone of my face.  I usually put this on my face in the morning and sometimes at night (I rotate with an Origins night moisturizer).  The reason I bought this was to lighten my freckles and seems to be working!!  I&#x27;m happy and hope they won&#x27;t increase the price of this serum because then I may need to re-consider.  At the current price, it is affordable in my opinion.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I just ordered second bottle.  Goes on a little milky however dries clear and doesn&#x27;t make my face look like a glazed donut.  Overall I am happy w/ the results as it has helped clear up my complexion.  I am a 45YO male.  Oh and straight too.  :)</li>
    <li> Came quick, I actually think it is working , has a smell ,but the price of beauty has its issues some time</li>
    <li> Used it for quite a while but really didn&#x27;t see any big changes. Moving on</li>
    <li> Love this product! Does what it says!</li>
    <li> My skin is starting to look better everyday. Clean smell glides on your face and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Still trying it out.  No one has said I look 10 years younger yet.  lol</li>
    <li> made me feel like a pow wowzer during the winter time. no ashy face here. i got my summertime cali sun kissed glow even though it&#x27;s winter time in the east coast. awesome product!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very soothing and it does make my skin feel radiant, glowing.</li>
    <li> Love it very much. I already re order today 😄</li>
    <li> Really like this product</li>
    <li> Does not remove age spots very well.  My spots are not that dark so I expected far better results.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery so far love the product gonna buy more for sure I&#x27;m telling my friends bout this it works great</li>
    <li> No change in skin. Smells like burnt grass (not the fun grass). I will not order again.  Also vendor contacted me for feedback, which is bothersome to me. Most people who purchase and love a product, especially Amazon customers, will leave feedback without &amp;#34;begging.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks. I like the fact that the ingredients are natural. My skin has good moisture and seems to be a bit smoother. I can&#x27;t see any great difference in areas of hyper pigmentation however I am hopeful this will improve over time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. After using New Radiance Naturals for 1 month I am amazed at the softer appearance if my smile lines and the lines around my mouth. I plan to continue using this product.  My skin just looks and feel so much softer I am very satisfied. Would recommend to anyone who wants to soften the lines around their mouth and their smile lines</li>
    <li> One of the things I really love about New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum is the fact that it comes in a dark amber coloured glass bottle, this ensures that the serum is not damaged by light! Unlike other Vitamin C Serums that I have used this is the only one with the claim that it can be used for the hands as well. This Serum has a slight scent to it, but once applied and absorbed you can no longer smell it. The consistency of the serum itself is nice and it absorbs fast leaving no greasy or unpleasant residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this serum twice daily for 3 weeks now. I have to say I’m impressed! Not only does my skin feel smoother and it appears to me to be more radiant as well! Another fantastic thing about New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum is that they offer a 365 day Money back Guarantee! Now that’s standing by your product! If you’re in the market for a Vitamin C Serum, I would recommend New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum!</li>
    <li> Got to me right on time great stuff</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT. I ACTIALLY SEE IMPROVEMENT IN MY SKIN.</li>
    <li> Tightens skin and nourishes...love it</li>
    <li> Facial serums can be a great way to keep your skin feeling smooth and hydrated all while keeping your skin healthy and happy. Vitamin C Serums are an essential staple in any skincare regime as they have a light watery consistency that allows fast acting ingredients to penetrate the pores quickly. Vitamin C is great for their anti-aging properties and make skin brighter and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum is just like most serums. It has a very light consistency which allows it to absorb into your skin within a matter of seconds. It leaves behind no oily residues so your skin is left feeling refreshed. This serum contains a Hyaluronic Acid base rather water so you get even better skin benefits. Hyaluronic Acid is great for the skins elasticity and helps with cell turnover. It is a great way to keep wrinkles and fine lines at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for a few weeks now and it has left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I no longer get those dry, itchy patches of skin and, better yet, none of that scaly looking dead skin patches that not even makeup can take care of. My skin feels a lot healthier and it leaves behind a radiant glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is made out of 98% natural ingredients and 72% organic ingredients. It also contains no parabens so you can feel confident about what you are putting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complementary in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
    <li> With the sensitive skin I have, I am very weary about what I put on myself but this sounded like something I could trust putting on my face.  I also decided to use this on my arms because of the uneven dark spots I have from scarring.I would recommend buying yourself a bottle or two!  This isn&#x27;t a remedy or miracle product, its a natural product which is going to help keep your skin healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Read more at http://www.aluckyladybug.com/2015/02/new-radiance-naturals-vitamin-c-serum.html#ZIk6RKQwtDYfeMio.99</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum works great on the skin. It goes on more like a toner but it absorbs quickly &amp; leaves no residue behind. Skin is left soft &amp; smooth. Helps clear up acne as well! Definitely recommend this product. (Product sent as promotional for review)</li>
    <li> Great serum! Good value!</li>
    <li> This is a WONDERFUL AND EFFECTIVE product!!! My very favorite EVERRRR! I only wish they made 4 oz size!!!!😉😀 It is also a fabulous company to deal with!</li>
    <li> parts of my skin look better since using however, i am still waiting for the wrinkles to disappear.........</li>
    <li> Great product - I use it every day</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very easy to apply with the dropper and the instructions are simple. I look as if I have had a well rested good night&#x27;s sleep with this product. I only get about 5-6 hours of sleep per night. lol..... .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I Love this product!!!! After only using it for two days there is a notable difference in my skin.Colorado winters can be brutal! This winter has been especially cold and dry. I feel like this vitamin C takes away the redness as well as the dryness that only a face wrapped in wool can feel. Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it. It&#x27;s SO affordable! Love Love Love it!</li>
    <li> I see the results while using the product, but no long term results.  I have been using this product for well over a month now</li>
    <li> DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY I feel like everything&#x27;s gotten worse it didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
    <li> I received this for a review and liked it the most of all the vit c serum things.  I liked it the most because it worked just as well as everyone else but it also had vit e added.  Vit e is a natural &amp;#34;preservative&amp;#34; so it made sense to me that adding that would be the best way to anti-aging.  I didn&#x27;t see a difference between this and the other bottles, but I think that longer use would make a difference due to the vitamin e addition.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it works!!!! And Amazon is the best price I have found</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements using this product</li>
    <li> I truly love this product; thus far, I&#x27;ve have ordered it twice and will cont&#x27; because it makes my skin look good, but feels good as well, and I can see the difference. Most product say you can see a difference in a certain period of time, but you really never see it, but you can feel and see a difference with this product right away. Now I&#x27;ve used different products all my life and I can say, some of them work, but I can also say, this one truly works! I&#x27;ll be 59yrs of age in lil over another month, two-time cancer survivor and I can say, &amp;#34;I still look good&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend as we are both sun lovers in our early 50&#x27;s.  She has only been using the serum for 5 days and we both see a difference already!  Excellent product ... will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> this product is incredible!!! I saw a huge difference after only 3 days..</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a topical Vitamin C serum before, so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. It has the added benefit of Vitamin E ( 2 anti-aging, free-radical scavengers are better than one). I&#x27;ll admit, after a \\&quot;certain age,\\&quot; we ladies can use all the extra help we can get with our laugh lines, dark circles, etc. Have only used this serum for a few days, but I can already see results... more even skin texture and brighter appearance. I&#x27;m hoping these results will continue with daily use. Highly recommended !</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum.  My skin is much smoother and clearer. My face feels refreshed and healthy.  My acne is clearing up.  People I work with say my face looks brighter.  I can’t believe the results!!!</li>
    <li> I was always told it&#x27;s never too early to start taking care of your skin but I never believed it until now! I&#x27;ve already seen improvements after a few days of use and feel like my skin is softer and more radiant. The product is way more natural than what I usually use but the results seem to be even better - definitely recommend and can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, after the first use, my face felt better hydrated and softer/smoother!&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to doing a follow up review on my blog in the next couple of weeks! Check out my review at&lt;br /&gt;http://addicted-reviews.blogspot.com/2015/08/new-radiance-naturals-vitamin-c-serum.html</li>
    <li> I like this product and will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> No good. Does not work. I want my money back. It&#x27; like water.&lt;br /&gt;M. Jones</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! This is the first product review I have ever written-partially due to laziness, but also bc I have honestly never been wowed by a purchase before. New Radiance Naturals, however, definitely warrants one. About a year ago I began to notice my first real signs of aging. The stray grey hairs could be easily dealt with but what really freaked me out were the fine lines that had developed beneath my lower lash line as well as the smile-induced crows feet. I began kicking myself for having boycotted sunscreen for the past 25 (that&#x27;s right-I&#x27;m only 25!!) years. Following my panic attack I sat at my computer for hours doing extensive research on the effectiveness of anti aging eye products and searched around for one with a 5 star rating, but to my dismay, they were all SO EXPENSIVE. Vanity won over in the end and I purchased one that is supposedly used by Jessica Alba (yea, right). After 3 months of use and no noticeable difference whatsoever I decided to try another-same story. I halfheartedly continued using it until about a month ago. I was on vacation and refused to let a friend post a picture of me because of my awful crows feet. He then recommended New Radiance Naturals. Though very skeptical, I decided to purchase a bottle. After all, it was far less expensive than what I had paid for the last two failed products.  I have now been using it for 3 weeks and am absolutely obsessed!!!!! The lines have faded significantly, to the point where I can barely make them out-even with the mirror centimeters away from my face. This is honestly a miracle product. Not only have I  noticed a huge difference in my appearance but my mom and several friends have also made comments! Needless to say I turned all of them on to New Radiance Naturals as well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product so far.  I have&#x27;nt been using it long enough to tell much of a difference.  It does make my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Really like product can already see a difference in my skin ! Seems to be doing what it claims to do</li>
    <li> Getting old isn&#x27;t easy! As we get older, the products we use on our skin should change with us. For example, the moisturizer I used in my 20&#x27;s just won’t cut it for me now! I still need the hydration, but a little anti-aging and wrinkle help would be great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great combination product because it offers Vitamin C which helps with collagen levels and also helps reduce wrinkles. It also contains Hyaluronic acid which is great for wrinkles, age &amp; dark spots, and help healing damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this product after I wash my face, but before I use my moisturizer. It helps lock the serum in place, so I can get the benefits all day long. It’s easy to apply, just takes a few seconds to gently rub into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I notice less dry skin areas, and over time I’ve noticed a reduction in red areas, fine lines, and even dark spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add in the fact that it contains Vitamin E which is great for your skin’s health, not to mention scars and damaged spots, but also for hydration, healing damaged skin and this product is several individual products rolled into one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this won&#x27;t roll back the years and give you that 20&#x27;s glow again.. it does help with the dry skin and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical when I first saw this product as I have tried many others over the years.... To my surprise this is the IT product. I noticed the difference in the tone and glow of my skin after only a few uses. I must say I&#x27;m hooked on New Radiance Naturals. I wish I knew of this product years ago, I would have saved years on my looks and hundreds in my wallet. Thanks again New Radiance Naturals!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Daughter. She uses it regularly and really likes the results.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product! Within days my skin looked better! I&#x27;m 59 and have some brown spots. They are fading and my skin is just brighter and healthier looking!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!  I bought this to see if it could help rejuvenate my skin. After a week or so a couple of discolored areas started fading. I was quite happy with that, but what I realized after 2 weeks was that a couple of white bumps that had begun to form near my eyes called Syringomas disappeared. Amazing.  Nothing has worked on the Syringomas on my upper chest in the past.  So now I am applying it to those on my chest.  Great product.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I loved how my skin felt after applying this product. It did not do aything with my frecles. Maybe using this product in winter would be a better idea. I wanted to get my frecles a bit lighter...this product did not do that, but my face felt healthy after using it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. I could see and feel the difference almost immediately. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I love this product and you&#x27;ll see results right away.</li>
    <li> The top isn&#x27;t a secure fit.  I shook it prior to application and lost half of it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll I haven&#x27;t used it that long yet but I already see a difference.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this produce. Will buy again,</li>
    <li> Had to stop using it for a while cause it dry out my skin. Will try it again soon.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week, I noticed a  brighter hue to my skin.  The circles I&#x27;m used to waking up with under my eyes have all be vanished.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what a difference another week will make.  I not only look younger but feel younger!  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Within 3 weeks I noticed a difference in my skin. Tighter pores smoother &amp; brighter</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Will definitely order more</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the difference this has made in my skin!! I keep getting asked what I am doing differently and recommend this exact serum to many of my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle based on reviews.  I thought I would give it a try.  I had no idea what this serum would do for me.  After using this serum for about 3 weeks, I noticed that the dark spots on my face faded significantly.  They did not all disappear but faded so much that many spots were no longer visible after applying makeup.  3 small birth marks stayed and did not fade.  I also noticed that my skin is smoother and easier for me to apply makeups.  I think this is a good product.  I also have tried other Vitamin C serum from Amazon.  Others did not fade the dark spots further.  I decided to come back to this serum for a few more weeks to see if the dark spots could be lighten up even more.  I will update.    December 10 update:  My dark spots did not fade further.  They are still visible without makeup.  I continue using this serum since I do feel my skin is tighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> Waited a while to see if I liked this and I really do.  Some Vit C serums that I have used are sticky but not this one...like it and will purchase again</li>
    <li> I have seen a wonderful change in my skin. It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Well I have used it 3 days now and my skin feels softer. Haven&#x27;t used it enough to give a good feedback but will be happy to up date this after a few more days of using product.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for only a week, so i really don&#x27;t know yet if it is going to live up to it&#x27;s promises</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I gave my mom a bottle and she loves it too. She&#x27;s 82 and uses it every day. People she sees once a week at church tell her she looks really good and ask what she&#x27;s doing. I will continue using this. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> this is great stuff...i love it</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels.  In only 1 week I see dark spots already fading.  I look forward to great results as I keep using this product.  I emailed a question and received a very fast reply from the company. I intend to buy more New Radiance products and am excited to see even better results as I continue usage.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It has been about a week since I&#x27;ve been using it and I already see a difference in my skin. I know it is used for wrinkles, which I have started dabbing under my eyes and on my forehead, and expect that to help with those areas. BUT the best part was some areas where I had sun damage. I put it on those and have already seen an improvement. I thought nothing would ever help with that. This is my new wonder product!</li>
    <li> Like most women, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market to find that one product that will do miracles. When I read about New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum, I almost did not try it because of my past negative experiences with other products. Well, I can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am that I tried &amp;#34;one more product&amp;#34;. Within one week, my skin was noticeably smoother and clearer. As I continued using it, I noticed the skin under my eyes starting to tighten and the fine lines are almost gone! It hasn&#x27;t been a month yet, but I can&#x27;t wait to see what will happen with continued use. This product is definitely a keeper!!!!</li>
    <li> Feels like the product is watered down.</li>
    <li> Unlike a serum this product is very thin like water but I wanted to give it a chance. The price compared to other products is very affordable. I was extremely excited to get great results following use the first month. I&#x27;ve been using this product two times a day in the morning and at bedtime. I&#x27;ve notice some improvement, but not what I expected. I noticed a little improvement the first two weeks to my face feeler softer and age spots starting to diminish, in the second two weeks there has been no changes or improvement. I wash my face before use and wait dry 10 minutes before applying this product. I will continue to use for another month hoping to get better results. I am 45 years old and definitely have uneven tone. age spots, crows feet, and wrinkles around my mouth and forehead. I would appreciate any advice available. I hope this helps you.</li>
    <li> After only a couple of weeks, I see a noticeable improvement in my skin. Love it! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works good but I don&#x27;t like that its watery so I try two drops but its only covers half of my face cuz it dries so fast. I like the hippie vitamin texture better and I feel that works as good and around the same price. I just hate that I run out so fast.</li>
    <li> This is great products . Silky smooth, has improved texture of my skin. I use it first thing of am and pm.. one of best product I have ever used. If it works for me , I&#x27;m sure it will work for a new you.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless beauty products over the years. One of the added challenges I have is that I am a runner, so my skin can be oily/combination depending on the season. This product is simply the best. I have been using it for a week and have had zero issues with any break outs of any sort and already see improvement in my skin tone, elasticity and clarity. Thank you for this product and please don&#x27;t ever discontinue it!!</li>
    <li> Product is great.....saw big difference in  texture of skin and wrinkles in a couple days of use.  Love the feel of my skin.  I have recommended product to 3 friends.</li>
    <li> I recently have gotten into making my own whipped shea butter. I wanted to add in extra goodies that would do great things for my skin, and one thing that I have been adding in lately is this Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Vitamin C Serum in the past, and it has always worked wonderfully for my skin. It brightens my face and gives me a natural radiance that I love. I make my whipped butters with enough product to last for a week, that way it stays fresh. I have been putting in a good 6 drops of this serum into my mixture, and that is enough for me to use to achieve that radiant look. I use this twice a day, in the morning and also before bed. I also use this alone by itself when I am doing a serious at home facial. I try to do these about once a week. My face feels so supple after using, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still young, in my late twenties, so I don&#x27;t have any problems with wrinkles or age spots. However I have noticed that my skin just isn&#x27;t as firm as it was say 5 years ago. Along with giving me a beautiful glow, this also makes my skin feel very youthful. It tightens my skin, and it makes me look fresh, well rested, and just naturally beautiful! I&#x27;ve been a fan of Vitamin C Serum for a while now, and it is something that I swear by!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I really did not like this product as  well as well as the Oz Naturals I guess they are probably the same but I have made myself believe  that the Oz Naturals is better.  what ever makes me happy right.</li>
    <li> After just 10 days of use, I can see a more vibrant tone to my skin and some of the puffiness under my eyes begin to reduce.  I am confident that this product will eventually smooth the lines around my eyes and face and I will continue to achieve a more youthful and healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and wish I found it years ago!  I&#x27;ll resupply without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. Just bought a couple of bottles to give as gifts.  After 2 weeks, the texture do my skin has improved greatly.  After using for 5 days, I cut down on the prescription creams and only use every other day.  I put The New Radiance on right after my shower, allowing it to dry before I put on my moisturizer and neck cream.  The dark spots seem to be fading but the biggest most noticeable change has been in the condition of my hands.  They look 10 years younger.  I always rub the left over product on my hands after applying to my face.  Will keep you posted on my progress.  At this price point, it is the best deal going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am waiting on a serum for the body.</li>
    <li> Had to return fur allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received a free product for review purposes. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this formula is non greasy, isn&#x27;t thick, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. It goes on easily and leaves my skin feeling amazing, even after the first use. It&#x27;s formula doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I can add moisturizer and makeup as usual. I don&#x27;t use many products on my face but this has easily become a part of my daily routine. I can use it on my face, neck, &amp; hands, and my skin feels smooth and youthful.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first becauseI tried other products from various places over the years but none ever produced results of any kind. However, this product is all natural, unlike the others, so I just had to give this product a try and I&#x27;m so very glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time on Saturday; today is Thursday - when I arrived at work this morning, one of the first things a co-worker said, &amp;#34;have you changed make-up?&amp;#34; I asked why she asked. Her response was: &amp;#34;your face looks healthier and better than I&#x27;ve ever seen it before&amp;#34;. I told her why it looked so good; she can&#x27;t wait to try this herself. I feel and see the difference myself - my skin DOES look healthier and is so soft to the touch now.&lt;br /&gt;I can absolutely say this is a truly amazing serum that everyone should use!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product for my wife, as she was looking for an organic anti-aging skin care product to fade her acne scars. After only one week of use we both noticed positive results. My wife was so thrilled with the product it inspired me to try it on the dark circles under my eyes. WOW! After only a few days I noticed positive changes in the look and feel of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for women (or men) who want to improve the look and feel of their skin!!!</li>
    <li> Tried it everyday morning and nite no change on anything very disappointed I would not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Disappointed...the &#x27;improvement&#x27; was ever so slight. A tiny bit of eyelid tightening is the only thing noticeable. I expected greater results. I am half-way through the bottle using morning and night.</li>
    <li> There wasn’t a strong scent, and no greasy residue remained on my skin. The bottle is very small so I use this quite sparingly!  At the right price, it’s definitely something I’d use on a regular basis to improve my skin’s appearance.  I received this to try out; the opinions shared here are mine.</li>
    <li> **I received a free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weeks product review is from New Radiance Naturals. A professional vitamin C 20% serum anti-aging formula that is vegan and not tested on animals. This is something important to me as I am an avid animal lover and do not like to endorse animal testing. This formula of anti-aging is the highest possible which should ensure the ingredients will create a potent and effective complexion on your face. The ingredients are to penetrate the skin creating a radiant anti line, wrinkles and age spots complexion. The product has a 365 day guarantee that they will return your money no questions asked if not pleased with the product. This is a true testament in my opinion to how confident they are in providing you with a youthful face once more. The product is made in the USA which is nice and is 72% organic. The ingredients stimulate the collagen and work on fading freckles, scars, aging spots and more. I was definitely excited to try this product to see the difference it could make for me in the sense of freckles and acne scars, etc. I used the product for a week before reviewing so I could note the appearance/feeling within the time frame. When I first tried this I used the dropper to place on my hands and then massage onto thinly my face and neck. The Vitamin C serum did not have any real smell or odor to it and immediately seemed to absorb into my skin. I used the product daily and I typically have dry skin so I was curious how it would work out for me. The first thing I noticed was how smooth my skin felt to the touch after using just one evening. The texture was very transparent like water and had with no odor was nice as a lot of creams and lotions have very strong odors that can sometimes irritate my skin. I have noticed the lines by my eyes (crows feet) have disapeared more gradually as I have used the product. My complexion just looks clearer and my face more refreshing and renewed. So, all in all I would give this a HIT review. The product is worth trying and I do not think you will be disappointed!!s by my eyes (crows feet) have disapeared more gradually as I have used the product.

    <li> An amazing serum for a great price. It left my skin feeling soft, made some of my skin spots fade. I would recommend for anyone who needs a great serum for after pregnancy. *opinion is my own, but I was gifted this product.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of vitamin C serums as I find consistent use makes a difference with my skin. I received a sample of New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C serum to try and to review. It has many of the qualities I appreciate in a vitamin C and I also feel it is a good value. (Some well-known vitamin C serums can be quite expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that New Radiance includes Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, and Ferulic Acid as I read from a number of sources (The Beauty Brains, Cosmetic Cop and others) that these work well with improving the effectiveness and stability of vitamin C (my layperson paraphrase). I also like that this serum is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formulation is gentle and does not irritate my skin. Sometimes  skin care products containing vitamin C can irritate sensitive, depending on your skin sensitivity and the formulation. I gave if four stars as I prefer another form of vitamin C as my first choice, this form is less likely to cause irritation to sensitive skin though. So it is mainly a matter of preference.  I recommend New Radiance if you are looking for a reasonably priced vitamin C serum that is made with natural and organic ingredients (New Radiance claims the ingredients are 98% Natural and 72% Organic).</li>
    <li> Good serum, non drying!</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Saw a difference within a few days. Getting ready to order again!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used other oils and this is by far the worst.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a week, and I just love it, my skin looks so much better, thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this product following the comments from other buyers. I don&#x27;t feel a big difference, maybe I need more time</li>
    <li> I like it but is a little runny.</li>
    <li> I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WRINKLES AND SOME SKIN DISCOLORATIONS.  I HAVE TRIED EVERY PRODUCT ADVERTISED AND SPENT A LOT OF MONEY WITH LITTLE OR NO RESULTS.  I HAVE BECOME  QUITE SKEPTICAL AND DECIDED NEVER  TO TRY ANOTHER ONE.  MY BOYFRIEND IS MUCH OLDER THAN I AM AND LOOKS MUCH YOUNGER THAN ME, HE HAS NO WRINKLES AND THAT MAKES ME SELF CONSCIOUS,NEVERTHELESS, I STILL HAVE AN OPEN MIND THAT MAYBE ONE DAY SOME GREAT PRODUCT WILL BE DEVELOPED AND COME TO MY RESCUE. THAT PRODUCT HAS ARRIVED, IT;S  NAME IS NEW RADIANCE NATURALS.  A FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT IT AND INSISTED THAT I TRY IT. I RELUCTANTLY ORDERED A BOTTLE WHICH ARRIVED ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO.  I IMMEDIATELY TRIED IT AND WITHIN ONE WEEK BEGAN TO SEE SOME CHANGES IN MY FACE.  MY FACE FELT SMOOTHER, THE WRINKLES WERE REDUCING, SKIN DISCOLORATIONS WERE DISAPPEARING AND BAGS UNDER MY EYES  GETTING SMALLER. MY BOY FRIEND SAID TO ME \\&quot;YOU ARE A 67 YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE A 40 YEAR OLD YOUNG LADY\\&quot;+ WHAT ARE YOU EATING. I DID NOT TELL HIM MY SECRET YET.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT REGULARLY, IT WORKED FOR ME  AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.  I ran out of the product. I cannot wait to receive my new shipment. I already miss having the product to use.</li>
    <li> This makes you skin quite LITERALLY glow! I saw significant improvement on my acne spots. Do keep the bottle tightly closed as it evaporates quite easily as I unfortunately learned. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wify and she looks better as far as I am concerned.  Best thing is she also loves it.</li>
    <li> It has cleared up dark spots on my face. I&#x27;m impressed</li>
    <li> So far I like this product, its too soon to say if its the best serum for anti aging but my skin does look better than when I started it.</li>
    <li> One of the best serum I have ever used. Ordering another one.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this facial product.  It does glide on easily, but disappears immediately into my skin leaving it feeling drier than before application.  O won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> It irritated my skin. I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell yet....no improvement so far.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I&#x27;m hoping it will work. My only question is how much is a layer as it state in the bottle to apply on face and neck? Confused!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Works well with lightening spots</li>
    <li> I was really expecting &amp;#34;more&amp;#34;.....or SOMETHING.... Needless to say I was disappointed and would not purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> leaves my skin feeling very soft</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to know if it makes a difference, but I like the easy application.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my skin . It was softer and I looked like I got a good night sleep.  The texture of my skin was smoother and more youthful. Radiant and glowing. This product is I believe better at night.</li>
    <li> Great product for exfoliating.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on the 90 dollar version.  I tried that and this works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved vitamin C serums, but they were always so insanely expensive and generally only available from dermatologists or boutique/spa brands. To be able to find a serum of this quality at such a low price is incredible. It&#x27;s a large bottle and will last forever, you only need a few drops. It&#x27;s nourishing and feels really good when you put it on your skin and I saw results almost immediately. Discolorations fade and the skin tightens- it does a particularly good job on the back of your hands at turning back the clock. My hands look younger and smoother and the skin is tighter while some of my heavy freckling is fading. I&#x27;m a big fan of this blend as well, you get not only a high level of vitamin C, but a ton of other wonder ingredients to boost it&#x27;s efficacy. This is a good serum to use in the mornings under your makeup to boost sun protection and the prevention of free radicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount, but opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> So far so good can tell more about this product in one Month.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this very long, but I do like the way it goes on and the way my face and neck feel after using it!  So smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I really believe that I&#x27;m seeing a bit of improvement around my lip area already!!&lt;br /&gt;I will leave more feedback once I&#x27;ve used this a bit longer!</li>
    <li> After using this almost every night for a couple weeks I really notice a difference. Age spots and other pigmentation is lighter. I would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> jury is still out on this. just started using it. can update in a month?</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Love it. Takes a couple of weeks to see a difference....but you will :)</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks I see a dramatic improvement in my skin.  Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> I can see great improvement in my skin!!</li>
    <li> Awesome. All what says and more</li>
    <li> The ordering and receiving of this product was good.  No problems in getting it.  However, I have sensitive skin and this did not work for me.  I have given up on these formulas and will just use a gentle cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using  this for about 2 weeks, I think my skin looks brighter, wrinkles less noticeable, I am 57.</li>
    <li> looks good Works good</li>
    <li> Give it to my wife couple days ago and She told me She really loves it!!! And it was a reasonable price!!!</li>
    <li> I had to order another bottle, the first I could not tell any difference. So I thought I should at least try one more time. I can see a little difference now. Just a little, maybe in time I will see more.</li>
    <li> I have been using it will be two weeks  on Sat the 4th can&#x27;t seem any difference I use it in the morning and at night I&#x27;m sure it works for some people but it&#x27;s not working for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has great ingredients. My pores are even getting smaller! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product needs to be on everyone! It&#x27;s a wonderful serum don&#x27;t be without this ladies.)</li>
    <li> I have used many expensive facial products but have never had such wonderful results as I am having with New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C serum.  After using this product for two weeks or so, I already was noticing a glow and my wrinkles seemed much lighter.  It wasn&#x27;t just myself that noticed the glow.  I made a new friend when on vacation, she called me to ask me what I was using on my face because I had a very becoming glow.  I am a big fan and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see a difference after a month....aside from the breakouts I&#x27;m experiencing.</li>
    <li> I have been battling with dark sun spots on my face, I had to use lots of make-up to cover them up, a friend told me about New Radiance Naturals and I decided to try it.  I bought two bottles and was very pleased with the result within days, I am so excited about the product I am sharing the good news with everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not seen any improvement, yet.  Hoping to see something soon.</li>
    <li> Love love love this serum after many years I finally believe in vitamin c serum</li>
    <li> The wife has only been using this for less than a week but twice a day and her skin does feel smoother and tighter.  So far she is very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a month ago and wanted to give it some time to work. It has produced amazing results. I spend a lot of time in the sun and had started to develop some spots (like big freckles). After a month using this serum, those have faded to become almost unnoticeable. It is pleasant to use any time, because it is absorbed almost immediately, so no mess, and my skin feels completely natural a few minutes after application. A very small amount seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also saw some negative reviews - two from people who apparently did not even buy the product (or at least not from Amazon). Either they did not use the product long enough, or they don&#x27;t understand what it does. This is not a temporary tightener - it gradually improved the tone and color of my skin over time. I didn&#x27;t see much change for the first few days, but after a few weeks, friends remarked that I looked more relaxed, and I could see why - tension lines were reduced, skin was smoother and seemed to &#x27;glow&#x27;. The improvement is quite obvious after a month&#x27;s use, not only for repairing the sun damage but for the overall skin tone. I have used less than a quarter of the bottle in that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is concerned about protecting and revitalizing their skin, especially those like me who spend a lot of time in the sun.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month.  Love the results.</li>
    <li> I would like to have lost a few more wrinkles,  but I am very happy with what the products did for my skin tone</li>
    <li> Love it, I use it on my face &amp; back of my hands to lighten up brown spots!!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money. It&#x27;s like foul-smelling water. Save your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.</li>
    <li> I have damaged skin due to sunburns when I was young (before the days of sunscreen) and now in spite of scrubs, peels, etc.the skin on my cheeks and nose gets just like sandpaper.  This serum takes away the roughness and I am happy with the results.  I was using a much more expensive serum that was good, but this product is just as effective for half the price.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any difference in my wrinkles but, I am going to keep using it and ordering  it.  I understand that it is not&lt;br /&gt;any fault of yours.  Thank You</li>
    <li> Was not too sure this would be of assistance but my wife encouraged me to order and try.  I have little experience with beauty products beyond hair gel and shave cream so this to me seemed a bit odd.  After consistent use of only 2 weeks we both noticed fine lines began to fade away. Glad she was right.</li>
    <li> Used for 3 weeks had no results at all not worth the money</li>
    <li> Goes on clean, not greasy at all. I see improvement in elasticity, I love it. I will definitely get sev more bottles.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever used on my face.  I noticed a difference after about two months.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> It is alright. But needs more body, is too fluid at times drops were wasted if one is not careful. It is good enough for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum....skin like a baby!!</li>
    <li> Well pleased!&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> It did a pretty good job. I am 76 years old and I am using it to take as many of the wrinkes out tha</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  I use it morning and evening then with my regular skin care products. I&#x27;m  loving how smooth my skin feels.</li>
    <li> Face feels nice, but no noticable difference</li>
    <li> deep wrinkles seem to be less noticeable</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic. I have never used a product that works so fast. It got rid of some sun spots on my face in two days. Incredible!</li>
    <li> Delivered quick. Great product!#</li>
    <li> It  showed  improvement in my  skin  condition</li>
    <li> I am currently using it. Too early to see results but it appears to be working.</li>
    <li> Question:  Can I use this product around my eye area/eyelid?&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!</li>
    <li> Is does nothing at all, have been using it I see no difference, just discoloration under my eyes and puffiness...always teary eye....</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife and she is very pleased with the results.  She thinks it has helped her.</li>
    <li> This product does firm my skin up when applied, but wears off quickly. Not long lasting.</li>
    <li> The best products I ever bought I do recomended to any one to get this products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and don&#x27;t see any difference from when I started. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after a short time. It is very light and it is easily absorbed. I have mixed skin and this product does not leave my skin feeling oily at all. The price is great compared to other serums in the market. Would recommend 100%</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this 60 days don&#x27;t see any change</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I have everyone at work using it now after they were all wondering why my skin was looking so good.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are nice. I didn&#x27;t specifically buy it for aging, which probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea considering it&#x27;s an anti aging product, but the ingredients are definitely good for your skin if that was upon any of your concerns.</li>
    <li> Loved it. My skin is more radiant, glows, soft. Getting lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Saw results in days.  Will continue to use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I the serum did go on smooth and I was able to apply my makeup over it with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;After using New Radiance for several weeks age spots seemed have faded.</li>
    <li> good product. I like it. works for me.</li>
    <li> For the first 2 weeks it took about a dropper of Serum on my face.After that a lot less.After using almost a whole bottle my face looks clearer,and I feel good about using it.I wish it werent quite so expensive because then you could be more generous putting it on and also use it on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle, so that means I am pleased with it. I have been a dedicated Philosophy customer but really intend to live my values, so the fact that this product is cruelty free is a plus. I use it on my hands and can see a difference there too.  The price is very low so I don&#x27;t skimp on using it. I do use it morning and night.  All in all a great product ! I am over 60 and outdoors with my dogs and horses quite a bit, no matter the weather.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to facilitate a review. Regardless all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different Vitamin C Serums in the past, so I know a little bit about Vit C Serums. (I&#x27;m not a doctor, though!). Vitamin C helps protect your skin from the sun. The New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum applied evenly, absorbed quickly, and did not irritate my skin - which cannot be said for other serums I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does the New Radiance Naturals Serum have Vitamin C with a 20% concentration - which has been \\&quot;scientifically proven to reduce the effects of sun exposure on the skin, including sunburn, sun spots, redness and wrinkles\\&quot; - but the New Radiance Naturals Serum contains Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin E. Vitamin C and E work very well together to reduce the appearance of aging and Hyaluronic Acid is a skin toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only 23 but I have a few scars I like to use this on and a few sun spots. I&#x27;ve already been using this product for a week and have noticed a slight difference. It can take several weeks to notice any big changes. I&#x27;ll update this in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I REALLY like this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a nice combination of Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin E. And it&#x27;s cruelty free!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a huge surprise to me was the fact that although the serum looks incredibly thick, it is actually extremely nice and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being so light, this so easy to apply and goes on quite smoothly! There is absolutely NO stickiness and I felt almost immediate absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the active ingredient that causes this, but I did feel a little tingling after application which felt interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I can&#x27;t exactly place the scent- but I really like it. It&#x27;s very herbal-esque and reminds me of a high end spa product. All, at a really affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this serum for a short while and it definitely gives an immediate glow. But, that&#x27;s not what impressed me so much with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I absolutely LOVE about this was just how soft it instantaneously look and feel. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally dig this!!</li>
    <li> This worked so amazingly well on me and I was shocked! I have acne scars and sun spots that never seem to go away and this has helped me tremendously. I can’t wait to try their other products as well!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty fantastic! With so many great reviews how can you not try it? First off, dropper applicator, genius and thank you! It is just so easy to apply with and works amazing and super quick! What makes this product stand out is really that it is more liquid than actual gel which I find absorbs into my skin so well! New radiance indeed! This product really magically erases dark spots and scarring which I have my fair share thanks to acne. This is really a fantastic product! I received this product complimentary for my honest review and here it is, it is one of the best vitamin C serums that I have ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out or flake off at all which I really appreciate with this combo skin of mine. Overall excellent product, I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks and I feel and see the difference in my skin. Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I was excited to try the products. I have to say only after one application I noticed a difference! My sunspots were already lighter and my skin glowed. Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like after a week/month. I&#x27;m so afraid to run out that I&#x27;m going to order more immediately!!&lt;br /&gt;Renee</li>
    <li> I am not expecting a miracle but when a product has a 365 day, no questions asked, money back guarantee....how can you go wrong? You have nothing to lose but some saggy, wrinkly skin! My problem area is my neck, eyes and around my mouth. Ok, so call me skeptical, but even if I could drop a couple years I would be happy. New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum can help fade acne scars, age spots, freckles, wrinkles and lines. And just by putting it on topically....no pills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need is a little bit. Rub it on and it&#x27;s absorbed almost instantly. I like that it&#x27;s not greasy and drys quickly. I also like that it&#x27;s made with natural and organic ingredients and never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the proof at http://plumcrazyaboutcoupons.com/new-radiance-naturals-vitamin-c-serum/</li>
    <li> Not what you rate it to be</li>
    <li> Great quality, very satisfied. Perfect transaction, professional seller, thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for a little while now (it was sent to me). It contains no parabens, no sulfates, no gluten, no alcohol and no phthalates. This serum is 98% natural, 72% organic and 100% plant based. I’ve been loving Vitamin C serums and have used several other brands in the past. I prefer this one by the New Radiance Naturals, because there is no scent and it doesn’t leave a greasy feeling on my skin. It’s watery and get absorbs into my skin easily. I apply it at night and I use about 6 drops each time. It’s not irritating, does not feel like it’s drying out my skin or making it oilier. I feel like the fine lines around my eyes (oh, how I hate them!) are less visible, my acne scars are almost all gone and my face definitely looks brighter, like it’s ‘glowing’ from within. Like I said, I have tried several brands of Vitamin C Serum and this one is is my favorite because of its consistency and effectiveness. It’s also pretty affordable.</li>
    <li> I am always open to trying new beauty products. The most recent trend of products I have tried is facial serums. While I have hated some and liked others I have hardly loved any. One recent serum that I have tried that I do love is the New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the product is not tested on animals and is made with natural ingredients. It is so hard to find beauty products these days with BOTH of these attributes so this was important to me. I also loved their money back guarantee if you were not pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, however, was pleased with the results. After only a couple of weeks of using I could tell that my skin was &#x27;happier&#x27;. What I mean by &#x27;happier&#x27; was that it no longer looked dull and actually looked brighter when I had no makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum was not greasy at all. It was actually very watery for a serum so it absorbed much faster and was not sticky on the skin. You also did not have to wait as long to do the rest of your beauty routine since it did not take as long to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some redness on my face that I do need to cover with at the very least a BB Cream but I am hoping over time that it was also fade as I continue to use this serum.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, have been using for 3 months and no difference in my skin. Not worth buying.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s, and since I started to see fine lines around my eyes, I am always seeking for natural solutions to look after my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that vitamin C serum is one of the best and safest things you can use. Vitamin C lightens pigmentations, and promotes collagen production in the skin. And because I love natural organic products, I was very excited and happy to accept this serum in return for a review.&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea that it contains 20% vitamin C, vitamin E, Hyaluronic acid, and Amino complex. Not all serums contain all these ingredients at once, also they are (98% Natural and 72% Organic)which is great!&lt;br /&gt;Applying a light consistency serum can be a bit of challenge for some, but I managed applying it by time. I used it twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, and followed by a moisturizer. Whenever my skin looked dull, vitamin C always is my number one choice, and this serum from New Radiance naturals was no exception. It also helped lighten few dark spots on my face that appeared lately. My skin now has a natural glow, more even tone, and very smooth.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference or changes to know if product works :-(</li>
    <li> When I tried it, it went on rather smooth, not greasy at all. There was no filmy residue after drying and it didn&#x27;t make my skin break out whatsoever. I am very happy with the results and recommend this product to anyone looking to care for their skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks on a daily basis, the bottle is now half full, and I’ve used it day and night before I apply my moisturizer. I had been looking forward to seeing some results in this product, but I haven’t seen much of a difference in improvement to my overall skin. I can’t say that it has helped enhance hydration nor improved any discoloration – let alone helped with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this product is actually really pleasant. I can definitely smell the witch hazel (a natural anti-inflammatory ingredient). The texture of the product is extraordinarily runny. It took about 5 minutes for the product to dry in which I could definitely feel a layer of it on my skin, but the feeling disappears after I add my own moisturizer to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t really notice my skin feeling any softer or looking any smoother. I’m just not excited about this product, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I have tried three kinds , but this is the best. works quickly making your skin look much younger. this ones a.keeper</li>
    <li> Enjoying the stuff this far and I do feel like my acne prone skin is evening out. I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with an acne medicated moisturizer as well as masks a few times a week but nonetheless I do believe it to be helping evening out the skin tone aside from my red pimples of course lol</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and boy do I see a difference. My skin looks brighter and clearer, the eyes circles I once had have gone away completely. When I wake up in the morning they aren&#x27;t puffy and I don&#x27;t look like a zombie. I have had friends comment on my skin in the last month saying it looks noticeable better. I love being out in the sun so it&#x27;s nice to have a product like this that will help keep my skin young looking. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a natural and really effective way to improve the health and look of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of products in the past, and this is by far the most effective and gave me the fastest results.</li>
    <li> Not doing what I thought it would</li>
    <li> This product has worked great for me. Within a few weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in the health of my skin. I don&#x27;t want to have a complex morning regiment, so I appreciate that this is the only product I need to use.</li>
    <li> Does not compare to Image hydrating ACE Serum, have tried this serum and a few others, but always go back to Image.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in dark spots. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again. My biggest issue with it is the smell - it has a strong and distinctive odor of rotting fruit. I used it a few times as an overnight mask under my regular moisturizer - I do think it evened out my skin tone a little bit (I&#x27;m very fair so every little thing - be it a zit or a scratch - leaves a mark). But I simply could not get past the smell, so much so that I became concerned it was spoiled (and without any sort of expiration date on the bottle, it could have been!) and threw it away. So while this product did sway me in terms of what topical Vitamin C can do for the skin, I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere to get my fix - and I&#x27;ll be pucky about finding a product with a clear expiration date.</li>
    <li> I believe this product has made my skin look more even, less dry, and actually younger.  I just bought my 2nd bottle and use this every day.</li>
    <li> Great poduct!!! I can see the difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;decent&amp;#34; 58 year old fair to medium toned skin that tends to be on the dry side with a few pale pink/reddened areas on my forhead, chin and cheeks.  Over the last 2 years, I have purchased thousands of dollars of high priced department store brands (Chanel, Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, Clinique) only to see little to no difference after use, dry patchy areas and/or major skin breakouts after a few days.  I purchased the Vitamin C Serum, the Sea Infused Moisturizer and the BEST Retinol Moisturizer and have been using them for 5 days.  I use the Serum followed by the Sea Infused Moisturizer in the morning and the BEST Retinol Moisturizer at bedtime. The Serum is absorbed almost immediately without any oily residual feel.  With the use of all three products, the appearace of my skin is brighter, moisturized (never oily), fine lines and wrinkles are diminished and, quite honestly, my skin looks about 10 years younger - without skin breakouts or dry patches.  In fact, I no longer am using a foundation - just mascara, eye brow pencil, a cream blush and lipstick.  UNBELIEVABLE PRODUCTS with UNBELIEVABLE RESULTS.</li>

    <li> The products seems to work pretty good, but I didn&#x27;t see a big diff in my skin.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work - bought 3 bottles. Didn&#x27;t do anything. I took it for several weeks, applying every morning. Took pics on Saturday morning each week. Can&#x27;t tell the difference from the first pic to the last...Asking for a refund.</li>
    <li> Calling it average, because I really haven&#x27;t had it, or used it long enough to review it.</li>
    <li> Still to soon to tell but been using this for 5 days . Fast shipping and good packing . Face feels a little tight after I use it . I feel like I have to put a cream on right away after to take the tight feeling away . I have had no skin reactions using this and I have sensitive skin.</li>
