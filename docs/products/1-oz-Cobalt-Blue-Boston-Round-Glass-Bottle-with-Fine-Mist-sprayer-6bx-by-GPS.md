      <li>The sprayer has to be trimmed to fit the bottle</li>
      <li>You will need to trim the tube on the mister to get it to fit.</li>

      <li>I keep hoping that it&#x27;s just how I put them together, or that I&#x27;m tilting/shaking them too much, but so far I haven&#x27;t pinpointed any user error, so</li>
      <li>Only using one right now</li>
      <li>I just made my first room/car/body aromatherapy spray using essential oils/distilled water/vodka.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted to use with my essential oils.</li>
      <li>Love the dark blue color.</li>
      <li>I love these little blue bottles.  </li>
      <li>They work very well when I am diluting essential oils to apply to my skin.</li>
      <li>The reason for only four stars is that an oil based blend (almond oil) doesn&#x27;t spray very well.</li>
      <li>Cobalt, so I know my oil is safe in it, small enough to carry in my bag!</li>
      <li>I just received these and have only used once so far</li>
      <li>Also, despite clear tops being shown in the photo, the tops on my bottles were all black, with clear lids.  </li>

    <li> these bottles were exactly what I was looking for and work great. I have essential oils mixed with water in them so have not experienced any clogging.</li>
    <li> Since I started making my own cosmetics these have been such a great find! Cobalt, so I know my oil is safe in it, small enough to carry in my bag!</li>
    <li> Great bottles for all types of uses.  I put Witch Hazel in it to spray my face whenever I need a refresher.  I also have mixed my own mosquito repellant recipes and put them in these convenient to use bottles.  Great for all types of liquids.</li>
    <li> Bottles arrived very quickly. I just made my first room/car/body aromatherapy spray using essential oils/distilled water/vodka. The fine mist sprayer workes perfectly!</li>
    <li> These have worked well for me. The other reviewers are correct the tops are hard to screw onto the bottles, but they seem secure even so.</li>
    <li> A great product, works well and quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. No problem with roller. Some were a little tight at first but loosened with little effort. Would recommend an purchase again. Like he blue color for protecting oils from light. Pretty too.</li>
    <li> So nice to find pretty bottles at a good price.  They arrived quickly and work great.  We made &amp;#34;room spray&amp;#34; for &amp;#34;auntie and grandma&amp;#34; gifts and they all loved them.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> These bottles are great.  The sprayer has to be trimmed to fit the bottle so don&#x27;t be alarmed when you open the item and the sprayer looks too big for the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love these little blue bottles.  I use them to mix my aromatherapy blends in.  I have made essential oil mosquito repellant and sent to my daughter in Alaska, she said &amp;#34;No more mosquitoes&amp;#34;, the jars are perfect for carrying on her hikes and camp outs and when she gets home she refills them.  I also use them for other essential oil blends.  They spray beautifully.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel size. They create a nice mist that I use for my 2.5pH EO water, 6.0pH Beauty water and 11.5pH water for cleaning my face. I only had one bottle of 20 not spray correctly; it streamed versus misted.</li>
    <li> Only using one right now but it works just fine. Exactly what I wanted to use with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> I just received these and have only used once so far but I like it. The sprayer is a fine mist and works well. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> They work very well when I am diluting essential oils to apply to my skin.</li>
    <li> these bottles are just as described. the inside tube is nice and long so it goes to the bottom of the bottle. nice and sturdy. no hitches. good product.</li>
    <li> Cute, and very practical little bottles.  The mist is very fine.  I have a bottle in the kitchen and each bathroom, for a refreshing spritz, and have shared a couple with friends, who also love them.</li>
    <li> The bottles are really nice for my essential oils blends. The reason for only four stars is that an oil based blend (almond oil) doesn&#x27;t spray very well.

    <li> Nice sturdy well made bottles. Love the dark blue color. I bought these to give away as gifts and to use for essential oils mixing. The bottles are working very well, great spritzing from the pump and no leaking from the lid.</li>
    <li> True cobalt blue glass, nice size for travel or small gifts, but sprayer tops don&#x27;t quite fit right. I&#x27;ve been playing with them to get them on, but they fit a little awkwardly. However, they work great - nice fine mist and the 2 I&#x27;ve used have not leaked. I will probably order them again, but wish the spray tops fit the bottles better.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love these bottles.  And I will say, when they don&#x27;t leak around the threads of the top, the spray is absolutely superb - very fine, and a good spread.  However.  Of the six I got, I&#x27;ve used three, and two of those three leak.  I keep hoping that it&#x27;s just how I put them together, or that I&#x27;m tilting/shaking them too much, but so far I haven&#x27;t pinpointed any user error, so I&#x27;m going to have to blame the tops.  Also, despite clear tops being shown in the photo, the tops on my bottles were all black, with clear lids.  If the seller addresses these issues, I&#x27;d be happy to update my review.</li>
    <li> Great quality bottles, used as gifts and they work very well.  You will need to trim the tube on the mister to get it to fit.</li>
    <li> The quality is there, but I thought I would be getting white spray caps, instead I got black ones. And also missing 1 covering cap.</li>
    <li> works great for EO spraying,even w/carrier oil.</li>
    <li> received timely and intact</li>
