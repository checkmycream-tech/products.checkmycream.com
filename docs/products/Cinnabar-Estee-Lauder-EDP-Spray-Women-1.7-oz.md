      <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>I use it too, but more so in the winter instead of during the summer.</li>
      <li>Estee Lauder has had this fragrance for decades and it&#x27;s still a favorite with women.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the fragrance, though my husband wrinkles his nose and finds it too strong-smelling.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, clean smell that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s time tested and true and doesn&#x27;t ware off!</li>

      <li>I knew my girlfriend liked this perfume, but when I bought this for her for the first time, I had no idea</li>
      <li>My wife said her bottle was fine</li>
      <li>and we both agreed that it was fine and smelled</li>
      <li>Appreciated the smooth easy transaction and fast shipping with this GREAT Seller.</li>
      <li>and you guys know how important that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you love Cinnabar, it might be worth adding your voice to the reviews there, to let Estee Lauder know; maybe it will make a difference.</li>
      <li>I wore this scent many years ago &amp; wasn&#x27;t aware they still made it.</li>
      <li>its very strong and if you use it that strong old smell will stay on you all day.</li>
      <li>i wish companies would quit messing with the classic scents!!!</li>
      <li>Sultry, spicy, intriguing...</li>
      <li>The fragrance lasts for hours making it worth the price.</li>
      <li>another old favorite of mine i ordered and am disapointed with.</li>
      <li>I used to use Opium and had used it since the first year it appeared on the market.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a fragrance in the same exotic mode</li>
      <li>It will now always be one of my first choices.</li>
      <li>&quot; I had never been successful with scents in the past</li>
      <li>I still love the scent after wearing it for the last 25 years.</li>
      <li>I just love the scent, and it really does stay on your skin a long time.  </li>
      <li>Cinnabar is available through the Estee Lauder web site, priced at $42.00 a bottle, with free shipping, free gift wrap (if requested), no sales tax, and the usual freebie offers and</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to try a perfume I had not sampled, but reading a lot of reviews really prompted me to buy it.  </li>
      <li>The original fragrance is much stronger and last much longer.</li>
      <li>Only the fragrance is offered now, apparently, the lotion and powder are no longer available, howeever many of the reviews request they be brought back, so maybe it will help.</li>
      <li>This became a classic as soon as it was launched.  </li>
      <li>I remember when Cinnabar first came out, and now (in my 60s) when I wanted a fragrance, I test a huge stack of scents and Cinnabar won hands down.  </li>
      <li>can highly recommend this</li>
      <li>I encountered another woman the other day who had such a nice &#x27;incensey&#x27; fragrance on ...</li>
      <li>A pet peeve of mine is receiving goods I&#x27;ve paid good money for, only to find out that they are past the date of usefulness.  </li>
      <li>It is a spicy, mature scent that lasts and lasts!</li>
      <li>Someone said in an earlier review that it has been around since 1978, but I am sure I have been wearing it since the early &#x27;70&#x27;s, and I was not aware of it being a new fragrance at that time.</li>
      <li>and it was bad, Amazon&#x27;s customer service is very good about replacing or refunding a defective product.</li>
      <li>Whether you like your perfume light and airy, or heavy and musky, you&#x27;ll find just what you&#x27;re looking for at Estee Lauder.</li>
      <li>smells to be old as well, NOT as all like the scent i used to wear.</li>
      <li>But the formula was obviously changed a few years ago and it was NOT a change for the better.  </li>
      <li>The subtle blend of cinnabar and her own personal scent is well beyond compare.  </li>
      <li>And though not overbearing, it is a long lasting fragrance; a light spritz in the morning will last throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>its missing that rich under tone</li>
      <li>I am concerned to read that Cinnabar is becoming hard to find.</li>
      <li>For special occasions or everyday.</li>
      <li>It will come as no surprise that I highly recommend this fragrance, and certainly do not want to see it taken off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8 September 2012:</li>
      <li>but alas, I am hooked on the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to describe a fragrance, and this one is truly unique; it is spicy as opposed to floral, however, it takes on its own nuance with each wearer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder products and it was great shopping from  home.</li>
    <li> Shipper was on time everything went as it should</li>
    <li> Love it great service</li>
    <li> My sisters favorite perfume.  Gave it to her for a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Cinnabar has been a favorite for 25+ years. I was extremely disappointed when my last bottle ran out and I was not able to locate another anywhere! It had been four years and I had given up on finding it again, but I decided to try my hand at searching on-line. This is something I had never done before, and am now very glad I did, since I successfully found on Amazon and am now enjoying a favorite once again.</li>
    <li> I love Cinnabar!  So finding this made me so happy!</li>
    <li> Great product. My wife was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a wonderful spicy smell.  It has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for many years.  It has become hard to locate of late.</li>
    <li> I am a woman that likes my fragrance to last and Cinnabar does just that!  It is a spicy, mature scent that lasts and lasts! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It is only one of two that my wife has been able to use that does not give her a headache, and it smells great without being to over-bearing.</li>
    <li> This has been a sort of \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent, since I accidentally discovered it years ago, though I confess to wearing something lighter during the summer.  When my grandkids arrive with hugs, they say things like, \\&quot;Mmm!  You smell good,\\&quot; or \\&quot;you smell like Grammy.\\&quot; I had never been successful with scents in the past (I avoid the detergent aisles in stores and won&#x27;t walk into candle stores).  They either made me sneeze, seriously inflamed my sinuses or made me smell like I&#x27;d immersed myself in fly-spray (even the ridiculously expensive brands worn by friends).  I&#x27;ve never had a complaint about it having a negative reaction for others, though I get lots of, \\&quot;What are you wearing--it smells great.\\&quot; Maybe that&#x27;s because I \\&quot;spritz\\&quot; in the air BEFORE I dress and then walk through it, so it&#x27;s my body chemistry that creates the distinctive scent. (I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on others who wear it.)&lt;br /&gt;In any event, if Estee Lauder ever plans to discontinue it, put me down for a case.  I&#x27;ll need a lifetime supply!</li>
    <li> I remember when Cinnabar first came out, and now (in my 60s) when I wanted a fragrance, I test a huge stack of scents and Cinnabar won hands down.  I just love it, not everyone is an spice/oriental scent person, and it is strong, but if you do... try a sample!</li>
    <li> Have used Cinnabar by Estee Lauder for years and years and have not found anything that comes close.  The price was comparable to department stores but the convenience of free delivery and no sales tax made it an exceptional buy.</li>
    <li> Appreciated the smooth easy transaction and fast shipping with this GREAT Seller. Estee Lauder is a popular name brand and this fragrance is my Mom&#x27;s favorite! Whether you like your perfume light and airy, or heavy and musky, you&#x27;ll find just what you&#x27;re looking for at Estee Lauder.</li>
    <li> A pet peeve of mine is receiving goods I&#x27;ve paid good money for, only to find out that they are past the date of usefulness.  I have always loved Cinnabar and looked forward to using it again.  The oils are so stale that the only thing I can use it for is to sweeten the inside of a trash bag.  Cinnabar itself is lovely.  Just watch where you buy it.</li>
    <li> Cinnabar has been my favorite for years. I always receive compliments when I wear it. The fragrance lasts for hours making it worth the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance. Thanks</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!!!</li>
    <li> I used to use Opium and had used it since the first year it appeared on the market.  The fragrance was wonderful and it had real &amp;#34;staying power.&amp;#34;  But the formula was obviously changed a few years ago and it was NOT a change for the better.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a fragrance in the same exotic mode and I&#x27;ve finally found it.  CINNABAR!!!  it&#x27;s wonderful -- much better even than the old Opium.  So all your former Opium lovers -- try Cinnabar.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I encountered another woman the other day who had such a nice &#x27;incensey&#x27; fragrance on ... then I rememberd Cinnabar and ordered this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So glad they still make it - it was not easy to find.  I LOVE the fragrance, though my husband wrinkles his nose and finds it too strong-smelling.  It is the &#x27;parfum&#x27; so a tiny dab is all you need.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Have always loved Cinnabar. Wish they still had dusting powder.</li>
    <li> This is just not what it was years ago....its missing that rich under tone it used to have.  i wish companies would quit messing with the classic scents!!!</li>
    <li> This was given to my sister in law for Christmas. It&#x27;s something she wears all of the time. It&#x27;s a nice, clean smell that lasts all day. I use it too, but more so in the winter instead of during the summer. Estee Lauder has had this fragrance for decades and it&#x27;s still a favorite with women.</li>
    <li> Used this product since 70&amp;#34;s !  Is my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; fragrance !! Hate that Estee Lauder has put out a NEW cinnabar that is not equivalent to the original ! Call me crazy... LOL... I ordered 85 bottles for my personal use so would have the original  scent for rest of my life :-)</li>
    <li> I wore this scent many years ago &amp; wasn&#x27;t aware they still made it. I was so happy to find &amp; purchase it.</li>
    <li> Nice strong winter scent. I used to buy KL but at $300. uh no. This is close but always has the excellence of anything by Estee Lauder. There&#x27;s a reason this perfume has lasted a long period of time. It&#x27;s time tested and true and doesn&#x27;t ware off! A must have for winter!</li>
    <li> ...what else do you need to know? Excellent gift for my wife as this is no longer sold in stores. This is one of my two personal favorites that she wears.</li>
    <li> I simply love Cinnabar by Estee Lauder.&lt;br /&gt;The only fragrance I like by them.&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet yet present.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!  One of my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> another old favorite of mine i ordered and am disapointed with. as like a bottle of youth dew i also purchased this one smells to be old as well, NOT as all like the scent i used to wear. dont waste your money. its very strong and if you use it that strong old smell will stay on you all day. youd be best to order something like this from a department store.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try a perfume I had not sampled, but reading a lot of reviews really prompted me to buy it.  I just love the scent, and it really does stay on your skin a long time.  It will now always be one of my first choices.</li>
    <li> I am concerned to read that Cinnabar is becoming hard to find. Someone said in an earlier review that it has been around since 1978, but I am sure I have been wearing it since the early &#x27;70&#x27;s, and I was not aware of it being a new fragrance at that time. I have read elsewhere that is is one of Estee Lauder&#x27;s foundational fragrances, and has such a solid following that it is no longer advertised, but this is the first I&#x27;ve heard that it has become hard to come by. I usually buy at least a couple of bottles at a time, thus I don&#x27;t need to restock very often, so this is news to me. Also, it seems the price has gone up substantially since I last purchased. I hate to see the price increase-- it was pricey enough before-- but alas, I am hooked on the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to describe a fragrance, and this one is truly unique; it is spicy as opposed to floral, however, it takes on its own nuance with each wearer. And though not overbearing, it is a long lasting fragrance; a light spritz in the morning will last throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply love, love, love this fragrance; there is nothing else like it, and in all these years I have never tired of it. It will come as no surprise that I highly recommend this fragrance, and certainly do not want to see it taken off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8 September 2012: The prices I am seeing for this product on Amazon are crazy; one seller is asking $69.99 per bottle! Cinnabar is available through the Estee Lauder web site, priced at $42.00 a bottle, with free shipping, free gift wrap (if requested), no sales tax, and the usual freebie offers and samples-- I just ordered some today. Only the fragrance is offered now, apparently, the lotion and powder are no longer available, howeever many of the reviews request they be brought back, so maybe it will help. If you love Cinnabar, it might be worth adding your voice to the reviews there, to let Estee Lauder know; maybe it will make a difference.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  its usually difficult to find now.  Wish they still made the powder.</li>
    <li> I will be returning to purchase this product in the future, it is the only perfume I use....a little more expensive then in the store, but I hate shopping in the mall</li>
    <li> The only perfume I wear! The price was cheaper than my local cosmetic counter. I love the spicy undertones of this fragrance.</li>
    <li> The bottle has leaked everywhere and wasted a ton of the contents, this perfume is a luxury that I buy only once a year and now almost half of the bottle has leaked and wasted.</li>
    <li> Great price, very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I knew my girlfriend liked this perfume, but when I bought this for her for the first time, I had no idea how appreciative she would be..! I&#x27;ll have to remember to keep this perfume well stocked in her bedroom..!  The subtle blend of cinnabar and her own personal scent is well beyond compare.  I&#x27;ll never shop for another, since I smelled it in her hair...Well done, estee lauder..!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Cinnabar for over 20 years and it&#x27;s all I wear!  I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on how good I smell, it has become my signature scent! There will never be another perfume that will ever compare to Cinnabar for me...great, great product and it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I still love the scent after wearing it for the last 25 years. It is a perfume that doesn&#x27;t shout that you are wearing it. Very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the product I have used in the past. The original fragrance is much stronger and last much longer.</li>
    <li> My mother in law loved it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. It was delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> This became a classic as soon as it was launched.  One spray will tell you why:  one of the best warm, spicy orientals.  Great sillage and longevity.  If you like orientals this should be part of your collection.</li>
    <li> Sultry, spicy, intriguing... my signature perfume. Nothing else will do. For special occasions or everyday.</li>
    <li> My wife was thrilled when I gave her this. Perfume has a strong but very nice scent to it. Price was good and it arrived in the specified time. I was very pleased she was pleased and you guys know how important that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviews have mentioned that the scent had changed from what it once was or that it had gone bad. My wife said her bottle was fine and we both agreed that it was fine and smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that  Estee Lauder may have had a bad batch of this or the bottles that others were complaining about might have been very old from sitting to long somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can highly recommend this and if someone were to buy it and it was bad, Amazon&#x27;s customer service is very good about replacing or refunding a defective product.</li>
