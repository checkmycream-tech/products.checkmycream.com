    <li> I use this unscented grapeseed oil for diluting essential oils for my little one. It doesn&#x27;t soak in as fast as FCO, so it works well for her after-bath massage.</li>
    <li> Quality product has a thicker viscosity than some carrier oils</li>
    <li> Great quality. Love the clear bottle. Allows you to see the fine quality of the oil.</li>
    <li> I use Essential Oils and for many things, need a carrier oil. I&#x27;ve used Fractionated Coconut Oils but after reading other reviews decided to try Grapeseed. I&#x27;m hooked! It&#x27;s so much lighter and not at all greasy feeling. Plant Therapy has a wonderful product and I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone else who needs carrier oils. I&#x27;ll for sure be ordering more when I need it. Thanks for carrying this Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use this for massages (at home... not professional).  It is a good base out at a fairly reasonable price.  I use it with hot stones and it works well.  Does not gum up, and retains a silky texture as I use it.  There is no aroma associated with it, so if you would like one, just apply an essential oil that has your choice of aromas.  I would suggest that you add the essential oils in a separate (smaller) container so as not to have the entire container of grape seed oil with a single aroma... i apply just a drop or two to what I intend to use for a single massage.  That way i can rotate between the essential oils that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for....thanks</li>
    <li> Nice Oil.  No Smell, does what is expected and goes on smooth.  take a little longer to dry up than Coconut Oil, but feel it is smoother and spreads better.</li>
    <li> My wife and I were looking for an essential oil that was applicable to being an intimate oil,&lt;br /&gt;soothing sore muscles oil, an oil that would absorb easily into the skin and not be oily or&lt;br /&gt;greasey. This oil was thin in texture, yet stays on your skin long enough for slow, penetrating&lt;br /&gt;absorbsion without being sticky or gummy. You don&#x27;t need much of it to cover a large area&lt;br /&gt;needing to be messaged such as back, arms, legs and feet. My wife especially likes this&lt;br /&gt;oil for her feet which tend to be dry and tired after a full day of standing and working on them.</li>
    <li> Great base/carrier oil for essential oil use or as a moisturizer.  Since it does not clog pores, it &#x27;breathes&#x27; very well.  A little oil goes a long way - perfect for home massage use.</li>
    <li> great with DoTerra oils</li>
    <li> Smooth, light, not greasy. I use it with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> It did not work as well as product I used from Whole Foods. Price was the same.</li>
    <li> You have to have this message oil. The aroma is amazing. It mellows you right out and at the price they&#x27;re offering it for, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Spoil yourselves and get this and you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
    <li> Silky just like they say!  I use as my carrier oil but I have a recipe for paleo lemon bars that calls for grapeseed oil so it will already have a dual purpose.  Great product, thank you!</li>
    <li> Great massage oil.  Thick and creamy.  Not very fond of the smell, but when mixed with therapeutic grade essential oils this is a WONDERFUL carrier oil for massages!</li>
    <li> Works well with essential oils for massaging.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted and fast shipping! It is perfect for my acne-prone skin and works for my partner&#x27;s sensitive skin as well!</li>
    <li> Good oil for mixing with essential oils.</li>
