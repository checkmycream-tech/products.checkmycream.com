      <li>Wonderful and thank you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this item and the results were very good.</li>
      <li>I am reviewing this to report good results on a condition this cream makes no claim for.  </li>
      <li>Customer Service was good, got the product on time as promised.  </li>
      <li>, AMAZING, AMAZING!</li>
      <li>will continue a bit more!</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING</li>
      <li>But after about 6 weeks, I can say I&#x27;m very pleased with how much better my legs look.</li>
      <li>So didn&#x27;t even bother buying more product.</li>
      <li>I plan on ordering more of this when this jar is gone, but using it strictly for my roseacea.  </li>
      <li>Should have know better.</li>
      <li>I have been satisfactorily using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my credit card gets to looking better</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>No, my spider veins didn&#x27;t disappear, but they look much, much better.</li>
      <li>I even took pictures to make sure I would notice if there were a change.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping and great product.</li>
      <li>I am a healthy 29 year old and I take good care of myself.</li>
      <li>Must say, you need to really gop it on to work best, and when I am at home alone, I may use it several times a day............</li>
      <li>very costly-no results!!!</li>
      <li>I bought this originally to put on my spider veins on my legs.  </li>
      <li>I believe that this does help for the varicose veins, but you have to use it more consistently</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many other creams and pills to help my spider veins, and this was the only cream that worked best for me and visibly reduced my spider veins by 80%.</li>
      <li>I read another review before I bought the product that stated she got more spider veins, but I really did not believe the review, until I saw the fact for myself.  </li>
      <li>But if you use this consistently and are realistic in your expectations...then you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
      <li>I chose this product based on a very positive article in a  magazine.</li>
      <li>As of right now I would not recommend.</li>
      <li>My husband asked me what I was doing because he said my face was looking better, more like just rosy cheeks than heavily veined ones.  </li>
      <li>I saw no lessoning of spider or varicose veins, in fact, I actually got more spider veins while using it.</li>
      <li>This is my first time to buy this product.</li>
      <li>At first when I opened the product it was liquid lotion..</li>
      <li>Actually, they are more pronounced after applying the cream.</li>
      <li>Was good after rubbing the veins, but the next day, veins came back.  </li>
      <li>really tell if it works or not....will keep using it.</li>
      <li>I really felt I was ripped off on this one.</li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>But now after few months it become more liquid like milk..</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s supposed to take to work, but I&#x27;ll give it the whole first jar.</li>
      <li>But I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>At least I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only speak for my results of course, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this item and recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
      <li>Like this product so far but haven&#x27;t been using it consistently.cant</li>
      <li>Amazon has by far exceeded its customer service with return policies.</li>
      <li>During my 1st pregnancy I developed a 3 inch leg vein.</li>
      <li>Have used the product for two weeks, and so far, I have seen no improvement at all.  </li>
      <li>The spider veins I developed while I was pregnant have gotten much less noticeable.</li>
      <li>The container is only half full.  </li>
      <li>I used the whole container as directed and saw absolutely no change or improvement in my spider veins.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say they are completely gone, but they are definitely diminished.</li>
      <li>I started on July 20 applying regularly and so far I do not see any change.</li>
      <li>Kind of expensive for not working so well.</li>
      <li>It did not work at all - even the most minimal of veins did not fade in the least.  </li>
      <li>As one of the other reviewers posted, you have to have realistic expectations.</li>
      <li>My legs look exactly the same after a few weeks of using this product, thus it does not work.  </li>

<li> As one of the other reviewers posted, you have to have realistic expectations.</li>
<li> My legs look exactly the same after a few weeks of using this product, thus it does not work.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Second, I have used almost the whole jar and I have not seen even the smallest improvement on the SMALL spider veins I have on my legs.&lt;br</li>
<li> It does not say how long it may take to show improvement.</li>
<li> It was half full of this very thin watery white liquid that I would not dare use.  </li>
<li> The worst part of the Rosacea for me is the visible spider veins on the cheeks and nose, which greatly increase the redness.  </li>
<li> I am a runner, and had spider veins for a few years now around my knees, but recently I noticed some on my thighs as well.  </li>
<li> I think that if you were to rub your veins without the cream everyday, you would get the same results.  </li>
<li> I know people have been pitching bad reviews on this product, but I stopped using this to try other more cheaper brands.</li>
<li> but boy....... it has really lightened ad diffused my broken little veins my face</li>
<li> but I was hoping for more so a little disappointed</li>
<li> One star only because I couldn&#x27;t post this without at least one star.</li>
<li> I would get it directly from the lab that sells it, this seller I ordered from may be sending false product.</li>
<li> I have now used it twice a day for one month and the veins are half as visible as they were.  </li>
<li> are definitely less visible.  </li>
<li> This is a rather watery cream that did not seem to do anything to make the appearance of my spider veins look less noticeable.  </li>
<li> I have to say, that I am less than half way through the jar and the ones on my thighs</li>
<li> What a mess.  </li>
<li> I found no significant change after using this product.  </li>
<li> I think I may have wasted $21.00</li>
<li> I have used it for a few weeks and cannot tell any difference in my veins.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been tried this product few times..</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> Just wasted 40 dollars.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t bother with this; it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
<li> Was a waste of money.  </li>
<li> Instead of clearing after 4 weeks it seemed to make them worse, stopped using the cream and the veins seemed to go back as before.</li>
<li> I not sure it works.  </li>
<li> I just got too lazy to apply, but I do think it works on varicose veins, not sure about the spider veins though.</li>
<li> I was just not satisfied with this product and was applying it faithfully.</li>
<li> What is worse, the surrounding area is actually getting worse.</li>
<li> the laser was broken, so I ordered this, with little hope.</li>
<li> There seems to be an uptick in negative reviews on this product which is disheartening for me.</li>
<li> Thick or liquid?!</li>
<li> I was going to have the broken veins taken out by Dr., but when I showed up for appt.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve contacted the manufacturerer but they have failed to take action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> However, not impressed.</li>
<li> If you expect things to vanish overnight then of course you&#x27;ll be unhappy.</li>
<li> It is very difficult to rub into your skin and I am seeing no improvement at all.</li>
<li> it for someone who has bad veins.</li>
<li> no results..:(</li>
<li> disappointed and will never buy this product again.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> No results.&lt;br /&gt;Did not perform as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Hopeful...but very disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It did not work at all - even the most minimal of veins did not fade in the least.  I used it faithfully for over a month.</li>
    <li> did not do anything for me</li>
    <li> Customer Service was good, got the product on time as promised.  I have used it since I received it as directed.  I don&#x27;t see any change yet. I not sure it works.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and hope it does what they claim.</li>
    <li> The product declares to deminish the appearance of spider veins. I&#x27;ve applied VariClear Varicose Spider Vein Cream faithfully since 2-22-11 and have seen no results. Just wasted 40 dollars. This must be another scam. Should have know better.</li>
    <li> I used this product faithfully morning and night as directed.  I saw no lessoning of spider or varicose veins, in fact, I actually got more spider veins while using it. I read another review before I bought the product that stated she got more spider veins, but I really did not believe the review, until I saw the fact for myself.  I would not recommend this product, because it did not help a thing in the month I used it.</li>
    <li> First, this arrived jar arrived unsealed, so I am assuming the product in it was the one I ordered,but not really sure since the container was neither in a box or the cap sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I have used almost the whole jar and I have not seen even the smallest improvement on the SMALL spider veins I have on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it I would get it directly from the lab that sells it, this seller I ordered from may be sending false product.</li>
    <li> This is a rather watery cream that did not seem to do anything to make the appearance of my spider veins look less noticeable.  I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It does not say how long it may take to show improvement. I started on July 20 applying regularly and so far I do not see any change. As of right now I would not recommend. I think I may have wasted $21.00</li>
    <li> I have used the product for 4 weeks and have not seen any disappearance in spider veins. Actually, they are more pronounced after applying the cream. I will finish the product in about 6 weeks to see if there is a gradual improvement.</li>
    <li> Amazon has by far exceeded its customer service with return policies. I was just not satisfied with this product and was applying it faithfully. no results..:(</li>
    <li> I am a runner, and had spider veins for a few years now around my knees, but recently I noticed some on my thighs as well.  I have to say, that I am less than half way through the jar and the ones on my thighs are definitely less visible.  Still hoping for results on the ones that have been there longer.  I will definitely replace the jar when I am running low.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing. Followed instructions to the letter....Waste of money</li>
    <li> There seems to be an uptick in negative reviews on this product which is disheartening for me. I&#x27;ve used this item and the results were very good. No, my spider veins didn&#x27;t disappear, but they look much, much better. And that&#x27;s what it promises - to diminish the appearance of spider veins and varicose veins. If you expect things to vanish overnight then of course you&#x27;ll be unhappy. But if you use this consistently and are realistic in your expectations...then you&#x27;ll be pleased. At least I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only speak for my results of course, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this item and recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of usage, I&#x27;ve found this product doesn&#x27;t really diminish the tiny vein lines as I thought it would.  Kind of expensive for not working so well.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for weeks and there was some improvement but I was hoping for more so a little disappointed</li>
    <li> actually I don&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
    <li> My legs look exactly the same after a few weeks of using this product, thus it does not work.  I would not suggest that anyone buy it</li>
    <li> Like this product so far but haven&#x27;t been using it consistently.cant really tell if it works or not....will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and thank you.</li>
    <li> Update* I know people have been pitching bad reviews on this product, but I stopped using this to try other more cheaper brands. Next to none worked on me except for this brand. My opinion is if you tried every brand under the sun with no results then try this.&lt;br /&gt;Once my credit card gets to looking better I&#x27;m going to buy more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is, but what doesn&#x27;t work for every one else works for me. I&#x27;ve tried many many other creams and pills to help my spider veins, and this was the only cream that worked best for me and visibly reduced my spider veins by 80%.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of this cream thru The Amazon, unfortunatey I received them  in two shipments, one of the cream received open an  unsealed as if it was used, I wrote an email about this but no one replied to me.</li>
    <li> It helps to diminish spider veins</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tried this product few times.. At first when I opened the product it was liquid lotion.. But now after few months it become more liquid like milk.. Is it expired product? This is my first time to buy this product. I don&#x27;t know how the lotion supposed to be. Thick or liquid?!</li>
    <li> I have been satisfactorily using this product for many years. However, what I received from my Amazon purchase was a watery substance that spilled all over the place when I opened the jar. I&#x27;ve contacted the manufacturerer but they have failed to take action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed and will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I believe that this does help for the varicose veins, but you have to use it more consistently than I did after awhile I just got too lazy to apply, but I do think it works on varicose veins, not sure about the spider veins though.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this to report good results on a condition this cream makes no claim for.  I bought this originally to put on my spider veins on my legs.  However, I began to wonder if it would work on my Rosacea.  I used Revitol (which is advertised for Rosacea for one month with no difference whatsoever).  The worst part of the Rosacea for me is the visible spider veins on the cheeks and nose, which greatly increase the redness.  I started putting this cream on my face twice a day and started noticing a decrease in the spider veins on my cheeks.  My husband asked me what I was doing because he said my face was looking better, more like just rosy cheeks than heavily veined ones.  I have now used it twice a day for one month and the veins are half as visible as they were.  I plan on ordering more of this when this jar is gone, but using it strictly for my roseacea.  There appears to be about a 4 month supply in one jar by just using it on my face.  Where the Revitol only lasts one month and it makes no difference in the spider veins.  Someone ought to start marketing this for Rosacea.  Best product yet that I have found for that condition.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all. I used every drop and there has bee no change. Don&#x27;t bother with this; it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I used it as directed but saw no difference in my varicose veins. I would not&lt;br /&gt;recommend it for someone who has bad veins.</li>
    <li> I chose this product based on a very positive article in a  magazine. However, not impressed. It is very difficult to rub into your skin and I am seeing no improvement at all.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a few weeks and cannot tell any difference in my veins.  Will finish up the jar and see if anything changes.</li>
    <li> Item was received with no safety seal.  It was half full of this very thin watery white liquid that I would not dare use.  Know telling whose hands have been in it.  The container is only half full.  Returning for credit.  What a mess.  One star only because I couldn&#x27;t post this without at least one star.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I used the whole container as directed and saw absolutely no change or improvement in my spider veins.</li>
    <li> During my 1st pregnancy I developed a 3 inch leg vein. After my 2nd pregnancy that vein turned into a six inch leg vein. I am a healthy 29 year old and I take good care of myself. I purchased this leg vein cream and faithfully used it as suggested and I saw no results. I even took pictures to make sure I would notice if there were a change.What is worse, the surrounding area is actually getting worse. I guess surgery is my next option.</li>
    <li> Instead of clearing after 4 weeks it seemed to make them worse, stopped using the cream and the veins seemed to go back as before.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 3 weeks ago.  On some of my smaller veins I saw some minimizing.  On the larger clusters of visible veins I definitely saw a difference.  The clusters are not visible.  I am going to order this again.</li>
    <li> very costly-no results!!! followed the directions to no avail. I really felt I was ripped off on this one. definitely would not purchase ever again.</li>
    <li> Have used the product for two weeks, and so far, I have seen no improvement at all.  I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s supposed to take to work, but I&#x27;ll give it the whole first jar. (I bought 2 jars).</li>
    <li> I think that if you were to rub your veins without the cream everyday, you would get the same results.  Was good after rubbing the veins, but the next day, veins came back.  Was a waste of money.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my legs or the spider veins on my face that I could see even after 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work...save your money!&lt;br /&gt;Used for 5 weeks, as instructed. No results.&lt;br /&gt;Did not perform as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Hopeful...but very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hope that this would work, as nothing I&#x27;ve tried before has made a difference. But I was pleasantly surprised! The spider veins I developed while I was pregnant have gotten much less noticeable. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are completely gone, but they are definitely diminished. As one of the other reviewers posted, you have to have realistic expectations. I did not see results overnight. But after about 6 weeks, I can say I&#x27;m very pleased with how much better my legs look.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING! Love it. I was going to have the broken veins taken out by Dr., but when I showed up for appt. the laser was broken, so I ordered this, with little hope. Must say, you need to really gop it on to work best, and when I am at home alone, I may use it several times a day............ but boy....... it has really lightened ad diffused my broken little veins my face</li>
    <li> After 2-1/2 weeks I have not seen any results yet, no change! will continue a bit more!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!!! I have instantly noticed a difference in the appearance of my spider veins as well as my varicose veins! Super fast shipping and great product. I recommend it, ladies!</li>
    <li> I found no significant change after using this product.  Perhaps different people react in different ways to its effectiveness, but I didn&#x27;t find it made any difference for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results after using it for a month. So didn&#x27;t even bother buying more product. Would not recommend</li>
</ol>
