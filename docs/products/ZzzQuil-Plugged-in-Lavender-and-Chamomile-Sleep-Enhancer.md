      <li>but I found the smell pleasant.</li>

      <li>Aromatherapy seemed like a good alternative.</li>
      <li>I must stay that the results were  surprising.</li>
      <li>I received this product for free for testing and review purposes and it has been one of the best things to happen to me</li>
      <li>It does not smell like you just plugged in an air freshener which I think is a good thing.</li>
      <li>i still think the idea is good and will continue to use the unit that was given to me by the company</li>
      <li>I look forward to getting refills and hope the good sleep lasts.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s good cause</li>
      <li>This is a good idea because we fall asleep in every room of the house.</li>
      <li>scent pads are basically good for one night, so this might not be for long-term use.</li>
      <li>I simply loved this product.</li>
      <li>I DID GET A FULL NIGHTS SLEEP!!!    </li>
      <li>so I added those to a wall diffuser and they continue to experience the same wonderful sleep and bright happy mornings!</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful, it does tend to relax me, but getting sleep for a full night was not a benefit of the product.  </li>
      <li>It took a while for the unit to warm up and distribute the scent throughout the room, but once it circulated it smelled pleasant</li>
      <li>I received this complimentary plug-in from Influenster, and I was very happy to test and review.</li>
      <li>I really liked the way this product made my room smell (it&#x27;s a wonderful, fresh fragrance), but I didn&#x27;t notice that my quality of sleep had improved.</li>
      <li>it needs better directions!</li>
      <li>The first night, I slept great!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would say it is an okay product, but for me, it wasn&#x27;t successful in aiding my sleeping issues.</li>
      <li>I woke up well rested and felt better than I had in months!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love the sleep enhancer!</li>
      <li>Smells amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although the smell is nice and calming, I would not purchase this item.  </li>
      <li>the fragrance of lavender and chamomile was very soothing and relaxing, perfect for the end of any day.  </li>
      <li>Not for me, but to each their own.  </li>
      <li>I plan on buying more refills and continuing to use this to help me get a good night of rest.</li>
      <li>I loved it because I love the scent of lavender.</li>
      <li>but it did have a &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; kind of smell, so be warned there.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an effective non-medicated sleep aid, continue searching because this isn&#x27;t it.of buying the refill pads and that you have to use one per day, so you&#x27;ll be spending lots of money on something that doesn&#x27;t help with insomnia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The ZzzQuil is a nifty product and the fragrance is nice.</li>
      <li>The aroma of camomile and lavender was nice and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I liked this plugged in aromatherapy sleep enhancer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how effective it will be over time, but the fact that I have to replace the pad every night may make this in-effective in totality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The packaging also states that for best results, you need to plug it in 30-60 minutes before you are ready for bed, so</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>was a nice scent to go to sleep to.</li>
      <li>Scent was nice and relaxing not over powering.</li>
      <li>so that was a nice</li>
      <li>The scent was nice and it lasted for two nights instead of just the one night it states on the packaging,</li>
      <li>Have to admit that the room smelled nice, but this didn&#x27;t knock me out.</li>
      <li>It is nice that it is aromatherapy instead of having to take a pill or liquid.</li>
      <li>It smells rather nice, flowery.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an effective non-medicated sleep aid, continue searching because this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>The scent IS pleasant and relaxing, but was way too strong for me.</li>
      <li>like the scent and the scent is pleasant and strong.</li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasant and when I first started noticing the aroma after plugging it in, it was almost as if I kept inhaling just to smell it more.</li>
      <li>Now, if you like the scent, it&#x27;s a good thing that it&#x27;s so strong.</li>
      <li>the room had a nice lovely and relaxing smell to it (but not overpowering by any means).  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to discover how great it works!!</li>
      <li>Not recommended for those with sensitivity to strong scents!</li>
      <li>very clean, not overpowering, its relly nice.</li>
      <li>I am giving this 3* because it has a pleasant scent, but didn&#x27;t help me sleep quickly.</li>
      <li>Great peaceful nights rest.</li>
      <li>I am a very light sleeper and have often had to move to my couch to keep from waking my husband as I toss and turn every night.</li>
      <li>Normally I am a very light sleeper</li>
      <li>The jury is out on whether this thing helped me sleep better</li>
      <li>With this aromatherapy unit plugged in I am able to drift off into tranquility until my alarm sounds in the morning.</li>
      <li>but I can tell you that my room smells a bit better.  </li>

      <li>I have the Vicks Vapor plug and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t sleep better</li>
      <li>Make sure you put it in the outlet closest to you and try not to overly touch the pad.</li>
      <li>It did help me relax and sleep better.</li>
      <li>My husband isn&#x27;t sure if it helps</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a light/fussy sleeper most of my life, so I&#x27;m always looking for ways to help improve my quality of sleep.</li>
      <li>However, the next day I put it on the lowest setting, and it was absolutely perfect.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think that this is a really nice product, especially for those who are having sleep troubles. Now I am not sure that this actually has any sort of medication (which is good because then it will likely not be habit forming) but it has a strong mixture of lavender and chamomile. I had it plugged in about 5 feet away from me, and the scent did travel. I also think the pads last longer than the box suggests; only throw out the pads when you no longer smell that scent. Also I did unplug it in the mornings. I would recommend buying the starter pack and seeing how you like it. The starter pack has four pads, which is plenty to know how it will affect you. I only took away one star for the price and for the fact that there is no off switch, so you have to unplug it after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I did receive this product complimentary from Influenster to test and review, but all opinions are my own).</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to try for free. I am grateful for it. It smells really light and relaxing. With this aromatherapy unit plugged in I am able to drift off into tranquility until my alarm sounds in the morning. It&#x27;s like falling asleep at the spa. I plan to purchase some for my children&#x27;s rooms as well.</li>
    <li> I received my ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Scented Sleep Enhancer from Influenster to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has difficulty dealing with insomnia, I am eager to try any new sleep enhancement products that come out. And the ZzzQuil Scented Sleep Aid really fits the bill with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of reasons that make this a great product. First, the assembly is quick, easy, and simple. Basically unbox, unwrap, plug it in- and you&#x27;re ready to pass out. Also, I found the Lavender and Chamomile scent to be very nice. It is not overwhelming but fills the room. It doesn&#x27;t that weird &amp;#34;soapy/chemically&amp;#34; scent that some lavender products seem to have. Using only 1 of the scent pads on medium, the sleep aid lasted through a very restful night. I also find the initial product and 5 sleep pads to be very fairly priced. I was concerned about the cost of the refill pack if I wanted to continue use of the product. But knowing that I could easily use one pad per evening instead of using both, I can rationalize the cost a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only had the small issue I had was that the directions specify not to touch the scented pad when removing it from packaging. There was no way I was getting the pad from the packaging into the sleep aid slot without touching it. Easily rectified by washing my hands right after- no biggie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, I really love the scent and how simple and easy the ZzzQuil sleep aid is to use. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> I received from my #ZzzQuil Scented Sleep-Aid Plug-in from Influenster free of charge for testing and review.  In the box you will received one plug-in with 4 refills.  (One refill will last one night.)  The pads are small and it took me a minute or two to figure out to add them.  You do need to pull the unit all the way up so you can add the pad.  There is only one way to enter the pad which made sense once I figured this out.  Our room is not huge so I placed it on the lowest setting as not to overwhelm us.  When I crawled into bed, I definitely could smell it.  It is a great combination of lavender and chamomile but is a tad overpowering in those first few hours. I didn&#x27;t have a problem falling asleep because of it so it did have the effect I was looking for.  I get up several times with our old dog and I was able to fall back asleep quickly and soundly.</li>
    <li> I received the Zzzquil Plug In free as a tester from Influenster AND I LOVE IT!!! I haven&#x27;t been able to fall asleep naturally for months since starting my new job. With this I&#x27;m no longer tossing and turning all night. I really do have a nice nights rest. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong or overpowering for me and I have a very sensitive sense of smell.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. As I typically spray my pillow with a night scent. However, while it was plugged in I woke up with almost a migraine. Not cool</li>
    <li> I received the ZzzQuil Scented Sleep-Aid to test and review from Influenster.com. I suffer from insomnia and most nights I only sleep an hour or so at a time, if I sleep at all. I was pretty skeptical when I received the ZzzQuil Sleep Enhancer. It took me a few minutes to figure out where to put the pad but once I figured it out, it was fairly easy. I noticed right away that it had a strong scent. I am usually not a fan of lavender scented anything but, this was a fairly pleasant scent. I plugged it in by my bed and waited about 20 minutes before I headed to bed so that it could start warming. I crawled in bed thinking it would be another sleepless night and the next thing I knew..it was morning! I woke up well rested and felt better than I had in months! I have been using it for a few weeks now and I am still sleeping all night and sleeping well. I really like that you can adjust the scent intensity. I have been telling everyone about this great sleep aid. The only thing I see wrong with it is you have to change the pads after 8-16 hours. Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> I received the ZzzQuil Plug in from Influenster.com to test.  I do normally use essential oils so I expected the product to work very well since it has the lavender and chamomile in it.  When inserting the pads, you have the option of inserting one or two pads.  Even though I read the directions I wasn&#x27;t sure really where to put the pads.  Once I inserted the first pad I realized that I did not put it in correctly.  I left it alone and used it for that night.  The smell is wonderful, it does tend to relax me, but getting sleep for a full night was not a benefit of the product.  I did use the plug in the next night with two pads instead of one.  The smell was overpowering.  Almost too much.  Even with two pads, I did not get the sleep that I thought I would though.  I do love that this product is not something you have to poison your body with in order to relax a little bit.  I&#x27;m sure it will work well as for others, but for someone with severe insomnia it doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
    <li> I received this unit to test for free as a member of Influenster. I often have a difficult time staying asleep during the night and thought I would give this a try to see if it would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the instructions on how to place the scented pads into the unit a bit confusing and nondescript. It took me a while to figure out how to place them properly. Once the unit was plugged in, I waited for the scent to radiate throughout the room. It didn&#x27;t take long. After a full night with the unit plugged in, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my sleep pattern. I still was up for an hour during the night. The scent was pleasant enough, but felt medicinal rather than aromatherapy. I came home the next evening and upon opening up my apartment door, I could smell the scent the unit gave off even though it was unplugged all day. I gave it a try for a second evening and, again, no change in my sleep pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say it is an okay product, but for me, it wasn&#x27;t successful in aiding my sleeping issues.</li>
    <li> I have insomnia and struggle to relax at night, so I decided to try this product in lieu of sleep medications. The product comes with four zzzzpads, and a plug-in unit. The directions on the box say to insert one or two pads into the unit. I had a hard time figuring out how to get them in and am still not confident I did it correctly because there were no clear instructions besides &amp;#34;insert one or two pads&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is definitely strong, and can be strengthened or decreased by moving the lever on the unit up or down. I was a little surprised by the odor because I use lavendar essential oil in my diffuser, and this does not smell anything like it. Maybe it is because chamomile is mixed in? At any rate, I did not find the smell entirely pleasant, and it was definitely too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as relaxing me? Eh. Not so much. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work on you. I think my body is just used to drugs.</li>
    <li> Initially, I tried this product with just one of the pads that came with it. It came with 4. It took about an hour or so before I could smell anything and when I did, I became very naseous, and it in no way put me to sleep. The smell stayed in my bedroom well into the next afternoon. I tried two pads the next night and got the same awful smell times two. I&#x27;m a Lavender and Chamomille lover and have scented oils and candles in these fragrances. I don&#x27;t know WHAT the smell is coming from this plug in. At $20 for just the plug in, Nyqil should really go back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> The ZzzQuil plug in gives off a wonderful scent of Lavender and Chamomile.  One packet lasted me about 12-24hrs.  The scent is very calming but not helpful for sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the smell is nice and calming, I would not purchase this item.  I found it to be more of an overpriced air freshener.</li>
    <li> So I got this for review and I thought why not give it a try. I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my sleep at all. I always wake up about two hours before I need to and have a hard time going back to sleep. I had this plugged in right by my bed and could hardly even smell it and I had it on the highest setting. I was really actually hoping this product would work better and I see it&#x27;s worked for some but I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference. :( When I could smell it I really wasn&#x27;t that keen on the smell, it stunk to me and I just didn&#x27;t like it. Although it didn&#x27;t work for me it could work for others, but I can&#x27;t recommend it. :(</li>
    <li> I received my ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Scented Sleep Enhancer from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical having tried aromatherapy sprays before, but this thing is just wonderful. The scent does help to keep me asleep once I fall into dreamland. I really hadn&#x27;t noticed before how many times I was waking up during the night until it was cut in half!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent adjustment doesn&#x27;t do as much as I would like which is why I marked 4 stars. It starts out strong and fades fairly quick. About 7-10 days for me before I can&#x27;t smell it anymore and need to replace</li>
    <li> I received my ZzzQuil Sleep Enhancer to test and review for free from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really skeptical. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to help me sleep. I have lupus and a handful of other diseases and it&#x27;s hard to sleep when you hurt. Because of that I certainly know my way around the sleep aids. I used it five nights in a row and every single night I fell asleep quickly and was able to stay asleep. That is so uncommon for me, so I can&#x27;t really attribute my sleep to anything but the ZzzQuil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews that say the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, but for me it was. By the second day I really liked the smell and would get a little sad when it wasn&#x27;t plugged in/I couldn&#x27;t smell it.</li>
    <li> Received this product to test and review from Influenster. I was skeptical at first and didn&#x27;t think the ZzzQuil was gonna help me sleep through the night but it did I got at least 8hrs of sleep. Love that you can adjust the scent to more or less. I would most definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical of this product being able to help me sleep through the night, but to my suprise I was able to get a full 8 hours of sleep the very first time I used it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I am not a fan of lavender.</li>
    <li> I received the ZzzQuil  Sleep enhance free from. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how the product worked, but once I referred back to the instructions, I found the product was simple to use. I plugged it in about an hour ahead of my bedtime and for the first time in a long time, I didn&#x27;t wake up in the middle of the night. So I left it plugged in until the next night, this was a big mistake, the fragrance became overwhelming to the point where I had to move it to another room. I think when used properly this product is very useful.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have had trouble sleeping at night fir a long time. The calming scent soothes me and helps to make sleep come a little easier. My husband also loves the calming feel and he wants to put one in every room of the house. This is a good idea because we fall asleep in every room of the house. I recommend this product to help make it a little easier to fall asleep. Thank you BzzAgent for allowing me the chance to experience this product for myself and my family. I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I received this from #Influenser and this worked for me. I love that you could adjust the scent and if I woke up during the night, I could go right on back to sleep. This is a must buy if you have problems w insomnia.</li>
    <li> I received the ZzzQuil Scented Sleep Aid for review from Influenster and prior to using it for the first time, I was extremely skeptical of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had problems with sleeping for as long as I can remember - I have trouble falling asleep when it&#x27;s dark out and I have trouble staying asleep no matter what time of day it is. I&#x27;ve taken pretty much every kind of sleeping pill and supplement available and nothing helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the ZzzQuil plugin, the first thing I did was put in one of the pads and plug it in. It was on the opposite side of the room as my head so the smell wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and to my surprise, I slept through the entire night without waking up for the first time in years. The next day, I left the sleep aid plugged in and noticed that closing the bedroom door caused the scent to become incredibly intense, even without changing to a new scented pad. Since it was the middle of the day I just unplugged it. That night, the scent was still fairly strong in the room so I plugged it in just outside my bedroom door and turned it to the highest setting. This turned out to be perfect. It provided just the right amount of relaxing scent without making my nose hurt or giving my husband a migraine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued using the sleep aid until I ran out of scented pads and will start using it again as soon as I get more. I&#x27;m still shocked that it worked so well given that it&#x27;s essentially a fancy air freshener and will recommend it to anyone that has sleep problems.</li>
    <li> I received a ZzzQuil Plug In Lavender and Chamomile Sleep Enhancer free from Influenster to try out and review.  I was very excited because I have a hard time sleeping.  I put in one pad only, as I wasn&#x27;t really thrilled with how it smelled when I opened the package.  I plugged it in about an hour before bed and turned it on the lowest setting.  When I went to bed, the smell was too much for me.  Maybe it is just the scent of the lavender or the chamomile, but it isn&#x27;t a very pleasing scent, and I did not get a better night sleep than any other night :(</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster to review and I like it! It worries me that you con&#x27;t touch it though. How toxic it must be! But it smells good and has enough scent for me to smell. I slept well and had peaceful dreams!</li>
    <li> I  received my ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Scented Sleep Enhancer from Influenster to test and review. I really like this product. The first night I used it I only used one scent pad instead of the two that is said to use. Scent was nice and relaxing not over powering. I slept very well, did not wake up multiple times like I am prone to do. I also fell asleep much faster than normal. The only reason I am giving this item 4  stars instead of 5 is I feel that the scent pad refills are a bit pricey. I will buy refills but not for every night use, just for those most needed times.</li>
    <li> I am a horrible insomniac and usually have a hard time sleeping under the best of conditions. The ZzzQuil Plugged In Sleep Aid sounded like it might do the trick since I am into aromatherapy and Chamomile and Lavender is a potent and relaxing scent combination.&lt;br /&gt;This is a compact unit that plugs in to a wall outlet. It has an adjustable switch that lets you control the degree of scent. I turned it on a high setting and inserted a scent pad. Have to admit that the room smelled nice, but this didn&#x27;t knock me out. It took a couple of hours before I put my book down to doze. Ditto for a second night. I read again only to nod off 2 1/2 hours later. Both nights I used a fresh pad since each one provides about eight hours scent regardless of the setting.&lt;br /&gt;While this may work on people differently, this just didn&#x27;t work for me. The only thing that works for me is a dark room without noise or light distractions and an Aleve PM which knocks me out in 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;If scent knocks you out, this may work. I am giving this 3* because it has a pleasant scent, but didn&#x27;t help me sleep quickly.</li>
    <li> I have to say that set up was a bit confusing and the instructions were not perfect.  I misunderstood that you had to pull out the &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t take that long to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other customer&#x27;s reviews, I only used one pad.  I was afraid it would be overwhelming if I used two.  I have only three outlets in my bedroom, one on my side of the bed, one on my husband&#x27;s side of the bed, and one across the room.  I plugged it in on my side of the bed and was not at all overwhelmed by the smell.  The first night, I slept great!  After that, when I forgot it was there, I slept exactly how I normally do, sometimes great, sometimes not as great.  So at least it seems to work psychosomatically.  Still, I like it and it did help me when I was thinking about it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t think the scent is as bad as many people are posting. It&#x27;s a rather pleasing smell, but it&#x27;s not enough to put you to sleep in a wondrous aroma of lavender fields with chamomile blossoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give the 2 star rating is because I absolutely do not like the single use pads; it&#x27;s wasteful, expensive and I think it&#x27;s ridiculous that they have to be changed each night or every other night. I think this was designed to be someone&#x27;s &amp;#34;get rich quick&amp;#34; scheme, and it&#x27;s not quite worked out for them.</li>
    <li> I often have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I received from my ZzzQuil Scented Sleep-Aid from Influenster free of charge for&lt;br /&gt;testing and review. This Sleep-Aid came packaged with one plug in unit and 4&lt;br /&gt;scented pads. The directions on the package were easy to follow. I used one pad, plugged it in and set it on low. The aroma of camomile and lavender was nice and not overpowering. I unplugged it during the day and plugged it up at night about 15 minutes before going to bed. I feel like the soothing smells helped me fall asleep and stay asleep all night.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d like this item because I love the scent of lavender. Sadly, the lavender is not dominant over the chamomile and I don&#x27;t care for the scent. It was okay at first, but as the hours went on it got stronger and stronger. I tried it with only one pad and on the lightest setting, but it was still too much for me. Now, if you like the scent, it&#x27;s a good thing that it&#x27;s so strong. The pads only last 8 to 16 hours so running only one at a time and on the lightest setting will give you the most hours for your money. I could not find a price for replacement pads on line, so I have no idea what the price per hour of use will break down to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is simple enough; a tiny heating element sends warm air up through a scent soaked pad. The distance from the heating element determines the strength of the scent, so you just move the insert with the scent pad up and down. This looks like a weak spot in the design to me; the force needed to move it up and down requires some serious squeezing and pushing on the device - nothing even a weak person couldn&#x27;t do, but I don&#x27;t know how long the device will last. You have to slide it up to change pads so there is no avoiding doing this. There is no on/off switch so you have to unplug it in the morning to avoid using up the scent when you aren&#x27;t in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I didn&#x27;t like the scent, I can&#x27;t say whether it helps sleep or not, sadly.</li>
    <li> I like the scent, it may have helped a little, but it dries out quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a light/fussy sleeper most of my life, so I&#x27;m always looking for ways to help improve my quality of sleep. I&#x27;ve read several articles that espoused the benefits of certain smells (particularly lavender and peppermint) that help you sleep, so I was excited to try this product. This product is small and discrete: I plugged mine into a wall socket in the corner of my bedroom and hardly even notice it. This product comes with twelve sleep pads, and each pad lasts up to eight hours (so you&#x27;re getting about one night per pad, if you like a heavier smell). You can adjust the level of the aroma, and I left mine on the middle level, because any higher was a bit overwhelming in my small bedroom. Since I used the medium level, most of my pads lasted about two full nights. I really liked the way this product made my room smell (it&#x27;s a wonderful, fresh fragrance), but I didn&#x27;t notice that my quality of sleep had improved. After using this product for two full weeks, I felt more like it was a fancy air freshener that requires (expensive and pretty frequent) refills. I don&#x27;t think I would buy another refill pack of sleep pads for this product for awhile.</li>
    <li> We have mixed reviews on this one. It started out in my room but it was too overpowering for me. I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter moved it upstairs to her room and she feels she is sleeping better. But during the day I started smelling it downstairs and the smell seemed to be getting stronger and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now she has been plugging it at night and unplugging it when she gets up but she says the smell is starting to not be as soothing so it is not something she wants to use every night.</li>
    <li> The ZzzQuil is a nifty product and the fragrance is nice. However, my husband and I didn&#x27;t really feel a difference with our sleep. We both still got up in the middle of the night and we both felt normal the next morning. Also the fragrance is a bit strong, even on the lower levels. The packaging warns against touching the fragrance pack directly due to skin or eye irritation. Overall I think it&#x27;s a nice thought that may help some, but for us it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> I did not believe that this product would work as described. I followed the directions to set up and plugged it in. I only use one pad at a time because the scent is pretty strong. I was a little tired so I laid across my bed. When I woke up it was the next day. I thought it was a fluke so I plugged it in again the next night and got the same results. The results have been consistent. It helps me fall asleep and stay asleep.I received the ZZZquil plug in  fro free to test and review.</li>
    <li> I received the ZZZQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Sleep Enhancer for free to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;My initial encounter found me a little confused upon attempting to place the scented disc into the unit. It took a few minutes of trial and error, but I was able to successfully insert the pad...but NOT without touching the pad as instructed in the packaging. The scent for me was quite strong, so I put in one pad versus the two that the unit can hold. I plugged the unit in and within a very short time I could smell the lavender and chamomile. After a few hours, I had to unplug the unit because the scent was too overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I love the concept, but for me, this just doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> I rate this &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34; because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three settings: low (last 16 hours), medium (lasts 12 hours), and high (lasts 8 hours... according to the box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. On low the smell is very strong, on medium it is overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;2. How much are the pads?  As of this writing there is a 6 pack and a 12 pack.  Neither are listed on Amazon yet.  I&#x27;m guessing this product will be more than most are willing to pay.&lt;br /&gt;3. Waking is more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;4. Sleep quality is MUCH worse, both subjectively and measurably objectively (according to my fitbit).</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample from influenster. This plugs into the wall at night and comes with scented refill pads that last eight hours. I have trouble sleeping at night and this really did help. I have tried melatonin before but I actually think this works better. I plan on buying more refills and continuing to use this to help me get a good night of rest.</li>
    <li> I received this product free from ZzzQuil &amp; Influenster. I love it. It has a calm, relaxing scent which isn&#x27;t overpowering. It helped me to get my 2 y/o into bed &amp; asleep an hour &amp; a half earlier. I plugged it in before giving her a bath &amp; then once I had her bathed &amp; dressed, I took her I to her room and read 2 short books to her and she was out!!! No fussing or distraction techniques from her to get out of bed. It worked like MAGIC &amp; we ha e already purchased the refill pads. I&#x27;ll not be without them from now on :)</li>
    <li> I received a free ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Sleep Enhancer to test for Influenster. I was very excited to try the product because I often have trouble sleeping, but I&#x27;m reluctant to take any sort of sleep aid. Aromatherapy seemed like a good alternative. Apparently I didn&#x27;t read the directions very thoroughly, because I had trouble getting the unit to slide apart so I could insert the scented pad, but I finally figured it out. The fragrance seemed really powerful when I opened the first pad, but after I plugged it in, the heat somehow made it more subtle and very pleasant. I have to admit that even though I had the unit on the highest fragrance setting, I barely noticed the scent. However, I really do think it&#x27;s effective. On the nights that we used the ZzzQuil unit, my husband and I both slept more soundly and felt rested when we woke up. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received from my ZzzQuil Scented Sleep-Aid from Influenster.com.  it is a plug in scent warmer meant to help you relax and sleep better. I cant say that it MADE me sleep better, but the scent is WONDERFUL. very clean, not overpowering, its relly nice. the only DOWN side, the pads that are used (not an oil bottle like other warmers) does not last very long. It would be more improved if it was in an oil form in my opinion.</li>
    <li> @Influenster I have a 5, 4 and 2 year old....so there isn&#x27;t much that is going to help me sleep......I will say the smell was wonderful, calming and soothing....a nice addition to bedtime!!!</li>
    <li> I received ZzzQuil lavender scented pads to test and keep free from influenster.  I was completely satisfied with the result.  I sleep peaceful and soundly all night.  I also woke with more ease than I normally experience.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have nevernever used these before n I have been having a lot of trouble sleeping.  I received this and plugged it in right next to my bed. Not only does it help me sad keep, it smells good and helps with my sinuses. The scent of lavender with Vicks, you cant go wrong. Sleep sound, sleep clear and make your whole room smell good. If your having trouble sleeping try this with your chamamile tea!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free in an influenster voxbox and hate it. It smelled great when I opened the package, however it didn&#x27;t work. My husband and I didn&#x27;t even smell it on the highest scent setting. I&#x27;m glad I got it for free because I would have been mad if I had spent money on it. Disappointing!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Very relaxing. Great peaceful nights rest. Will definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary plug-in from Influenster, and I was very happy to test and review. I like that it emits a soothing lavender scent (aromatherapy)...and has varied settings for the intensity. I used it on the medium setting, and the scent pad lasted for about 11 hours. After the scent dies, you are to switch out the little pad...basically one for each night you use it. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 of 5 stars, I don&#x27;t care for switching them out that often and adding to landfills. However, I like that the aromatherapy oils on the pads are oils, and not just some noxious chemicals. I woke a few times (I have a 5 month old), and had no problem getting back to sleep. They do sell refills for the plug-in.</li>
    <li> I received one of these from Influenster to try, complimentary, and it&#x27;s amazing.  The scent can be as subtle or not, as you&#x27;d like.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and it&#x27;s very rest-inducing.  I lead a very high stress lifestyle and I strive not to take medicinal sleep aids.  This is definitely a great tool to help with that.  It&#x27;s easy to use and you have absolute control over the power of the scent.  You have the option to use one or two scent pads and then even to control the strength of those.  I definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re into aromatherapy or are trying to steer clear of medicinal sleep aids.</li>
    <li> I liked it. I did. I am not sure it made me sleep any better but the smell was refreshing and rather strong. But it smelled clean and the first night I used I swear I did sleep better but then it was the same after that....I received the product free to test and again while I liked I don&#x27;t see myself spending the money on it once I am done.</li>
    <li> I liked this plugged in aromatherapy sleep enhancer. I agree with other reviewers that it doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender and chamomile but I found the smell pleasant. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with falling asleep, though. It&#x27;s nice and easy to use, but I would&#x27;ve liked it better with a more true to lavender smell.</li>
    <li> This unit smells nice and is a very soothing smell. I&#x27;m not sure it is helping e sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent pads are basically good for one night, so this might not be for long-term use. It&#x27;s a little difficult to get the pad arranged correctly. The directions say clearly do not touch the pad, so you have to use the wrapper to put the pad in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pretty strong, but you can control it by sliding the pad.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to test and review. When I first got it I was completely thinking another plug in scent thing lol, but I figured might as well give it a try. I def can say that the stuff works and smells so good and really put me in a relaxing mood. The only thing I did notice is that the scent pad dried out fast and the scent started to fade. Other then that I def would buy this again and am really glad I got the chance to try it out.</li>
    <li> awful didn&#x27;t work at all would not buy</li>
    <li> Love the scent of the lavender and chamomile. It did help me relax and sleep better. The scent carries throughout the house so everyone was able to experience the ZZZZ&#x27;s. Love this</li>
    <li> The jury is out on whether this thing helped me sleep better but I can tell you that my room smells a bit better.  I have been dealing with a sleep disorder for the better part of 3-4 years now...ever since I had a brain aneurysm and surgery....  Instead of taking prescription medication for sleep, I have opted to try natural remedies and the occasional zzzquil capsule (one instead of the recommended 2).  When this was offered to me I immediately jumped on to trying it.  I used one pad for the first night to see if it would make a difference....I figured two would be overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My room is about 150 sq feet in size and one pad was enough to spread the scent in my room....although I did not notice any improvement in my sleep.  The unit was plugged in about 5+ feet from my bed...  I don&#x27;t know how effective it will be over time, but the fact that I have to replace the pad every night may make this in-effective in totality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this 3 stars because it is a soothing scent and will leave your room smelling cozy...  I subtract 2 stars since as a sleep aid it may be misleading and because a new pad has to be used every night that you want to use this device.</li>
    <li> As someone who suffers from insomnia a few nights a week but doesn&#x27;t want to take medication for it, I was excited to try this. In the package, you get the plug in unit with 4 lavender chamomile scented non-medicated pads. The plug in unit is made of cheap plastic and has an outlet attached to plug into the wall as well as an adjustable sliding tab to customize the fragrance output to low, medium, or high, which I liked. To insert the scented pad, you have to slide the tab to the highest position and pull it up, unwrap the pad, place it into the slot, push down, and adjust the output to your desired level. The directions state not to touch the scented pad, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible not to touch it even if you try to use the wrapping it comes in to place it in the slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent and the scent is pleasant and strong. I tested it at each output level (low, medium, and high) and found that on the low setting, the scent was barely detectable, at the medium setting the scent was very noticeable and comfortable, while on the high setting, the scent was overwhelming and made me cough, which obviously doesn&#x27;t  lend well to falling asleep. The packaging also states that for best results, you need to plug it in 30-60 minutes before you are ready for bed, so if you can&#x27;t sleep and decide to plug it in when you are having trouble sleeping versus on a regular basis before bedtime, you&#x27;re still going to be awake for up to an hour at least. The scent does last close to 8 hours on the medium output, but is undetectable at time frames longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this product does not do what it claims - help you sleep. I found no difference in getting more restful sleep or even in being able to fall asleep when I used this, so as a sleep aid, this fails miserably and I still found myself wide awake. It&#x27;s basically an expensive air freshener, but not the intended purpose. The unit&#x27;s current price is about $20 then you have to factor in the continued expense of buying the refill pads and that you have to use one per day, so you&#x27;ll be spending lots of money on something that doesn&#x27;t help with insomnia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t help and will end up costing you way more than it&#x27;s worth. If you are looking for an effective non-medicated sleep aid, continue searching because this isn&#x27;t it.of buying the refill pads and that you have to use one per day, so you&#x27;ll be spending lots of money on something that doesn&#x27;t help with insomnia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t help and will end up costing you way more than it&#x27;s worth.

    <li> I was sent the ZzzQuil Sleep Enhancer to test and review from Influenster. I was impressed with this product. It comes in a relaxing scent of lavender and chamomile. You insert one or two of the scented pads into the plug in, and you can adjust the strength of the scent. I inserted one of the pads and used it at about medium for about a week and have slept well all week long. It doesn&#x27;t come with an on/off switch, so can unplug if you are worried about it. It is nice that it is aromatherapy instead of having to take a pill or liquid. I would recommend trying this if you have trouble sleeping.</li>
    <li> I love ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Sleep Enhancer.  For several years now I have struggled with sleep.  I usually drift off to sleep just fine but have a hard time staying asleep.  I received this product for free for testing and review purposes and it has been one of the best things to happen to me, I sleep like a baby now.  The lavender and chamomile smell wonderful.  You can adjust the setting on how little or much &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is dispensed during the night.  If you are not a huge fan of lavender or have problems with strong fragrances then I would recommend setting this on the lower settings.&lt;br /&gt;How I use mine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st night - I started off using mine with just one scented sleep pad inserted into the plugin and plugged it in right before we went to bed and turned it to the lowest setting for fragrance.  We slept pretty well that night but not enough that I would have given the product 5 stars and let&#x27;s face it, some nights we just sleep better than others, so I was optimistic to if it was the product or just my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd night - I waited two days before trying again.  This time I did just one scented sleep pad inserted into the plugin like before, but this time I plugged it about 1 hour before we went to bed and closed our bedroom door.  I turned the fragrance setting to about the middle.  When we opened the bedroom door to go to bed the room had a nice lovely and relaxing smell to it (but not overpowering by any means).  That night I slept about 90% of the night, which is a huge improvement for me.  Before I had only been getting about 57% sleep according to a monitor I wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd night - For the final night I took the two remaining sleep pad and inserted them into the plugin like before, kept it set on the middle setting and plugged it in about 20 minutes before heading to bed.  I didn&#x27;t close the bedroom doors this time since I was increasing the number of sleep pads.  Once again, the room had a light and lovely smell.  I sat in bed and read for about an additional 20 minutes before going to sleep.  I slept all night long!!!!  ALL NIGHT!!!!  Hasn&#x27;t happened it years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  Needless to say, I am now sold on this product.  And the best part about it all is that it&#x27;s not a pill or drug that I have to take.  If you have ever had an issue with sleep then I highly recommend you trying this product.ely smell.  I sat in bed and read for about an additional 20 minutes before going to sleep.

    <li> I received this complimentary ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Sleep Enhancer from Influenster.  I have chronic sleeping issues, so I was that much more interested in trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;I used only one scented pad, even though it holds two.  The scent was nice and it lasted for two nights instead of just the one night it states on the packaging, so that was a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;This was a nice scent to go to sleep to.</li>
    <li> I was not the least bit impressed with this product. I normally hate the smell of lavender, but I will say the only positive on this was the nice scent. It was faint and not overpowering. But as far as helping me sleep, I used it multiple nights and there was no change to my sleep. I put in 2 of the pads and set it to high to get the max benefit, but still nothing. I also almost broke the diffuser loading it-it needs better directions! Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product for free from Influenster to review.</li>
    <li> I received the ZzzQuil Plug in Lavender &amp; Chamomile Sleep Enhancer from Influencer for testing purposes.  I was very excited to try it because I have terrible problems sleeping and have tried many different things in the past.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The sample only came with 4 nights worth of samples so I was only able to use for that many nights but I will definitely be getting some refills when I am able.  It didn&#x27;t put me into a deep sleep like I have only dreamed of (the way I slept when I was a kid...before becoming an adult, having kids and added stress in my life...oh to be young again!).  Instead, it really helped me relax and fall off to sleep easier and stay relaxed so that when I woke up I was able to go back to sleep easier.  All and all I would say I did get better sleep when using it.  I look forward to getting refills and hope the good sleep lasts.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received the ZzzQuil Sleep Enhancer from Influentster.  I really like the smell of the inserts, it was a very relaxing scent and helped me to feel relaxed at night.&lt;br /&gt;While using this item I felt that I was able to fall asleep more quickly and slept more restfully.  Normally I am a very light sleeper but I was able to sleep through noises that would normally wake me while using the ZzzQuil Plugged In Sleep Enhancer.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to sleep better without taking pills!</li>
    <li> This smells a bit strong when you pull it out of the package, but as it dissipates in the room, it&#x27;s actually quite pleasant.  The scent can be overpowering at first if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells (my husband didn&#x27;t like it) but gradually fades and I have found the scent pads to last longer than the 8 hours or so the package states they will.&lt;br /&gt;My son seemed to have a little bit more trouble sleeping, but since my &amp;#34;installation&amp;#34; of this coincided with potential teething, I think it could have been either one causing it!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great little product and I do think it helps to &amp;#34;create a relaxing and soothing sleep environment&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing refills.</li>
    <li> Our youngest (8) has SPD and ADHD and has issues sleeping. He would wake up several times per night. I plugged this into a hallway outlet closest to his bedroom and turned it on about 20 minutes before bed each night. 1 pad. lowest setting on unit. left it running for an hour and would unplug the unit. the scent lingered softly in his room all night. not only did his room smell amazing, but he was asleep in 10 minutes and remained asleep all night. He said it was the best sleep of his life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our older son (11) enjoyed the benefits of the plug in as well! his bedroom is next closest and has always found lavender relaxing. allowing the plug in to be on in the hallway allowed the scent to travel to all bedrooms without being over powering to one room of the house. He said he slept great and woke up refreshed and ready to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did this every night for a week and had the same results each night/morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product. We are out of scent pads now, but I have the essential oils and diffusers in my home so I added those to a wall diffuser and they continue to experience the same wonderful sleep and bright happy mornings!</li>
    <li> Um, one night only from each scented pad? This will cost a fortune if you want to use it every day. Scent was ok, not fantastic, and not very strong or noticeable in a large room. There are far better products than this for aromatherapy purposes. I think Nyquil is just trying to capitalize on the grocery-shopping public who aren&#x27;t more informed about aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m very disappointed that I never got to try out this product.  I lay that fault at the feet of the manufacturers... Vicks, which made the scented pads and Kaz, which made the plug-in enhancer.  When the product arrived at my house, the box had a warning that stated &amp;#34;Not recommended for infants under 10 pounds&amp;#34;.  That immediately had me concerned as I wondered if it was dangerous to small animals, such as cats (which I have two in my house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I reached out to both manufacturers.  Vicks said it wasn&#x27;t their issue because they didn&#x27;t made the device (even though they made the pads that go in it).  So, I the contacted Kaz.  They said the product was not testing for animals.  So, they could not answer my concerns.  I have a problem with this because most homes have pets and knowing the risks of a product like this to those pets is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As I was not able to get an answer on my concerns, I could not, in good conscience, choose to use this product.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars for an incomplete rating.  It&#x27;s not fair to give it one star if I don&#x27;t even know if it works.</li>
    <li> Frankly I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. I followed the instructions to install it in our bedroom. After half an hour later, I didn&#x27;t smell a thing and neither did my spouse. I got up and checked to make sure it was turned on and set on high. It was. Nevertheless, when I got close enough to it, I detected a very faint scent that was rather artificial and nothing close to a real lavender or chamomile smell. Our master bedroom is of an average size, so it&#x27;s either this product isn&#x27;t strong enough to fill an average bedroom or we have a desensitized sense of smell. Even if I could smell it, I doubt I could actually sleep in that artificial scent, let alone help us sleep.    All in all, this sleep enhancer doesn&#x27;t work for us. Even our Air Wick Scented Oil Air Freshener Warmer with Lavender and Chamomile refill that we used in our family room has a more natural and pleasant scent than this, which is way cheaper and last longer, and also a scent that I could actually sleep in.</li>
    <li> I received my free ZzzQuil to test by Influenster. Wow!! I was pleasantly surprised to discover how great it works!! It took about 30 minutes for it to kick in after it was plugged in!! I truly needed it because it lulled me to sleep after a very long day!! I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it myself.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand how something scented can possibly help with sleep but it worked great for me. I normally wouldn&#x27;t bother with something like this. I received the zzzquil scented sleep aid for free from Influenster to try and review. The night after I got it I couldn&#x27;t sleep and figured that was the best time to try it out. I don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender so I thought for sure the smell would bother me too much to fall asleep. I fell right to sleep! I woke up the next morning in shock that it worked so well for me. My husband even noticed (I had been keeping him up with my tossing and turning) how fast we both fell asleep. Without a doubt I reccomend this!</li>
    <li> I received  the product free to test and review for free! I love that this little guy helps me sleep better AND I don&#x27;t have to put a pill in my body to get it! The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming. It gently calms your mood until you fall asleep. Love it!</li>
    <li> I received this free to test from Influenster. I was a little hesitant that it would work. But my oh my! I slept like a baby! The scent is great and it lasts a long time. Only downfall is the pads are expensive. But not bad enough to keep from purchasing them again. I love this product and recommend it if you do not not like taking meds like i do.</li>
    <li> Influenster sent me this product. While I had high hopes that I would get some rest, the sents bothered my allergies and I was not able to sleep for the entire week that I tried it. As well as giving me an allergy headache. I finally got relief when I unplugged and removed it from my room so sadly I will not be purchasing this product</li>
    <li> I received this product from Influenster to review. As someone who has had sleep problems for a number of years, I was really hopeful this product would be a great, natural way to fall asleep. Unfortunately, this product was way too strong for my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I have few problems with lavender or chamomile. I will drink chamomile tea on occasion, and I have bathed using lavender oil to help calm me at night. But this was just too strong. Even though I had it on the lowest intensity setting, within seconds of plugging this in, I was having horrible reactions, was unable to breathe and even got a bit hazy in the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that Vicks can work on another formula that does not affect those of us with sinus issues and allergies. For now I&#x27;m going to find someone to give this to who doesn&#x27;t have the allergy issues I have.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. When I first got it I was sceptical,I want sure if this little thing would do anything for me not being able to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I went to plug it in I had to figure out had to get the little pads in the device. Once I figured that out within rent mins or so I could smell the room filling up with the lavender. I was impressed with the smell it wasn&#x27;t medicinal. I laid down and within maybe a couple hours a floated off to sleep. That&#x27;s good cause I toss and turn a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second night things got earlier I knew how to open it to put the pads in. When I came in the room I laid down and relaxed myself I must have passed out way before I knew it so it helped when it came to helping me go to sleep...Would like to get some of these for a friend of mine so she can get some sleep. This product it&#x27;s great when you allow it to work. If you keep thinking is it working then no it won&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I am a very light sleeper and have often had to move to my couch to keep from waking my husband as I toss and turn every night. I was given this product for free to test out and actually had pretty low expectations of it, but even on the first night, I noticed a difference in my sleep. After plugging it in, it takes about 10-15 minutes before you begin to smell the sweet scent, similar to Vicks Vaporub, but a little less aggressive, perhaps because I don&#x27;t have it directly on my body. The scent is very pleasant and when I first started noticing the aroma after plugging it in, it was almost as if I kept inhaling just to smell it more. The scent is very calming and helped me drift off pretty quickly. I did wake up a couple of times throughout the night, but was able to fall back asleep within minutes, as I noticed the scent in the air and began breathing it in. Almost as if my senses were craving that scent! I do feel as if this product has the potential to become quite expensive so I don&#x27;t think it would be something I would use daily, but perhaps when I find myself really struggling to get rest. That is really the only downfall that I noticed.</li>
    <li> I received from my #ZzzQuil Scented Sleep-Aid from @Influenster free of charge for testing and review purposes. The ZzzQuil Plugged In Lavender and Chamomile Sleep-Aid came packaged with one plug in unit and 4 scented pads. Users can choose desired intensity by adjusting settings: low, medium, or high before plugging it in the outlet before sleep. After reading reviews of the scents being fairly strong, and opening the package and discovering for myself that the scents were indeed strong, though not overpowering, I decided to plug in the unit on the other side of the room. It took a while for the unit to warm up and distribute the scent throughout the room, but once it circulated it smelled pleasant and I noticed I was beginning to drift off..&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use the unit when you will be able to get at least 8 full hours of sleep for best results. I actually only achieved about 7 hours of sleep, but that&#x27;s because of own personal internal alarm clock; sometimes I just cannot sleep past 6-7 hours. Anyhow, I thought I noticed a little more restfulness upon waking and had an easier time rising and getting moving! I will definitely try the unit again when I&#x27;m on vacation and do not have to wake up for work. Perhaps then, I will get my full 8 hours and resubmit a review. I would like to pit this unit against the ZzzQuil sleep aids that one takes internally for comparison, although I usually don&#x27;t need to take sleep aids, I&#x27;m kinda curious to see how the two compare. Thanks @Influenster for the free product to test and review.</li>
    <li> Occasionally, my daughter has trouble getting to sleep . . . And then getting up on time in the morning.  We&#x27;ve tried the standard &amp;#34;sleep hygiene&amp;#34; strategies of winding down in the evening, no TV/computer light, eliminated trace caffeine, sugars, etc, and thought this was worth a try.  She used one pad at a time, low setting, and found it helped some and lasted a few days.  We&#x27;re now adding low-dose melatonin: she&#x27;s tried 1,3, and 5 mg tabs, but her doc recommended *time release* 300 micrograms (1/3 mg)</li>
    <li> I received a ZZZQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Sleep Enhancer for free to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;First thoughts - it was a little confusing and slightly difficult to open the device and insert the ZZZpad.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how you&#x27;re supposed to put it in without touching the tab. So I touched and washed my hands after and that was fine. The aroma from the pad was really strong when I opened the package, but it&#x27;s very subtle in the diffuser. It does not smell like you just plugged in an air freshener which I think is a good thing. I&#x27;ve slept well the last 2 nights, but my poor sleep comes and goes so it&#x27;s hard to say how much is due to the device. It&#x27;s certainly not hurting anything. My husband isn&#x27;t sure if it helps but he is a regular ZZZQuil taker, so again hard to separate out the effects. I think long term use would depend largely on the cost of refills.</li>
    <li> I received this ZzzQuil™ Scented Sleep Aid through Influenster to test out and review.  I wasn&#x27;t sure to expect, I&#x27;ve tried other plug ins before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  When I first opened the pack, the fragrance was pretty strong.  I thought it smelled more medicinal than like lavender, but then after a few minutes of plugging it in, I got used to it. The fragrance lasted through the rest of the night and into the next day- I used both pads the first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a night owl and just generally have trouble drifting off to sleep.  I decided this would be a perfect opportunity to use something that didn&#x27;t put me to sleep medically  to help me out.  I must say, this actually worked.  I plugged it in and slept straight through the night, couldn&#x27;t believe it.  My kids even woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and when I normally would be jolted out of my sleep, I didn&#x27;t even hear them....thank God, my husband did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second night, I just used one pad and thought maybe I wouldn&#x27;t sleep as well....but I slept pretty much the same way.  The fragrance the second night was not as strong and more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with the plug is is you have to touch the pad with your fingers and the fragrance is really strong, it stays on your hands.  I had to wash my hands a few times to get rid of the smell as best I could.</li>
    <li> I love the sleep enhancer! It smells wonderful without being overpowering. i tried it for 3 nights after I received my free one from influenster! the first night i used one pad on medium then two pads on medium then two pads on high, i slept best on the second night but probably because the third night i had to wake up early. all three nights i fell asleep easier than usually and stayed asleep through the night which i almost never do. I will definitely use his when im feeling mega stressed out.</li>
    <li> Although I followed the directions for this product, I have found nothing positive about this it. I have installed it in a small bedroom, and I smell nothing. I closed the door to the room to see if the scent could build up. Still nothing. I could only smell the scent occasionally if I stood over it, and then it was very faint. I have it set on high. Then, I wondered if it worked subliminally, but I found no increase in relaxation or sleep quality. I had been hoping this would work. Sadly, it does not.</li>
    <li> I received my ZzzQuil Scented Sleep-Aid from Influenster free of charge for my review. Sleep-Aid came packaged with one plug in unit and 4&lt;br /&gt;scented pads. The second I received it I loved it because I love the scent of lavender.</li>
    <li> I received ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Sleep Enhancer from my friends at Influenster.  When I opted to take the quiz for the box, I thought, why not!  I do often have trouble sleeping.  I am wary to try medicines because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t wake up if something happens to the kids.  So I was excited to try this product!&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of aroma techniques for &#x27;curing&#x27; things.  I love my bath soaks for sore muscles, stress relief, and have tried it for sleep before.  I thought this would be similar.  I was wrong :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  There&#x27;s a lot of different reviews out there, and to each their own! The product is a small plug in item that has a place for two little scented pads to go in.  There are a couple of different ones, the one I was given was the sleep version.  Lavender and chamomile.  Easy to use? Absolutely.  You&#x27;re not supposed to touch the little pads but, if you do, it&#x27;s okay.  There&#x27;s an adjuster on the side of the product that allows you to have a lot or a little bit of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This product gave me a bit of a headache. Regardless of what number I set it on, the smell of lavender and chamomile was INTENSE.  I set it on the lowest smell and plugged it the farthest away from my head.  I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  I ended up unplugging it after a day.  HOWEVER, when I used it on my kids, it was great!  This product is in my 3 year olds room.  I&#x27;ve been putting it in and taking it out every few days so that the smell isn&#x27;t too intense, but so far so good!  I&#x27;ve noticed that he takes naps a little easier and goes down without a fight a lot of other times.  So as I said.  Not for me, but to each their own.  It&#x27;s a relatively inexpensive item to try and figure out if you can use it to fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I got the ZzzQuil Plug In and yes it smelled lovely, but didn&#x27;t do much more for me.  When I got this to try and review I as very excited, but the overall experience wasn&#x27;t as exciting.  After opening the box and reading the info provided to get a scented-pad into the plugin does not seem to hard till shouldn&#x27;t be too hard until you try it.  First but the wrapper holding the scented pad clearly states DO NOT TOUCH EXPOSED PAD, well the way the packaging is then how you need to place the product into the devise (one you figure out how to do it, is rather hard to not touch the scented pad, so right there it is a fail to me.  As for the smell, I have been very stuffy over the winter months and the few times I have actually be able to smell it is was lovely but it definitely wasn&#x27;t at full strength....and with that said it didn&#x27;t keep me asleep or my dogs with lavender and chamomile in the air.</li>
    <li> I received the #zzzquil product for free to test from #influenster. The scent IS pleasant and relaxing, but was way too strong for me. I had to unplug it. Unplugged the scent was pleasant and subtle, and did make for a relaxing sleep. But I cannot use the product as designed.</li>
    <li> I find the smell of lavender very soothing, so thought this would be a good idea for the family as we all have sleep struggles.  I&#x27;m sorry to say it did not work for us.  The scent itself was a little heavy and if we left it on overnight it was overwhelming even on the light setting (we are in an apartment so if you have big room this might not be as much of an issue).  It actually woke me up because I was coughing.  I do find it is a nice room deodorant in the bathroom - as long as you just plug it in for an hour or so.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to put me to sleep, or keep me asleep  Directions are confusing on how to install the pads.  Description also said it came with 12 pads, each good for 8 hours of sleep, but actually only came with 4 pads.  Item might work for some people, but just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I received from my ZzzQuil Scented Sleep Aid from Influenster free of charge for&lt;br /&gt;testing and review.  I have trouble staying asleep at night so I thought this was definitely worth a try.  When I initially plugged it in I was sick and had a cold.  I used two of the scented pads and had it about 3 feet away from the foot of my bed.  Although this product was meant to help with sleep, I found that it also helped with my congestion.  I could actually breathe when I was in my bedroom but not when I was in any other room.  The scent was pleasant and although it was at first overpowering, I quickly adjusted to the smell of it, and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have always had issues sleeping--both falling asleep and staying asleep.  When I was younger it would take me at least an hour of laying in bed to fall asleep.  Although it has gotten better as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I still have a lot of issues with sleep.  I got to try this out via Influenster, and I have to say: I am really digging it.  The first day I tried it out I set it to the middle level, and it was a bit too strong.  It actually woke me a up a couple times.  However, the next day I put it on the lowest setting, and it was absolutely perfect.  I slept like a baby--and I have been the whole time using it.  I got about a week out of one strip.  As the scent got weaker, I would just put the device on a stronger setting.  I&#x27;m sure there are other things out there that could help with sleep--maybe anything to do with chamomile and lavender scents, but this is a good one.  I really suggest it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Vicks &amp; Nyquil products through the years as Sleep Enhancers for insomnia, and restless nights. I never had any complaints about those products, but this ZzzQuil Plugged In Sleep-Aid did Not work for me. The Lavender &amp; Chamomile fragrance is too strong, over-powering. This kit includes 1 Plug-in, with 4 Pads, which is over-priced, especially for those living on a budget. I tried it with 1 Pad only, and was over-whelmed by the strong fragrance. Not recommended for those with sensitivity to strong scents!</li>
    <li> This is one very, very expensive air-freshener that seems to capitalize on the 22% of Americans who suffer from insomnia (and are willing to try anything to find some rest).    This is just a standard piece of plastic in which you deposit a fragrance scented-pad and then plug it into the wall. Bath and Body Works had similar products a few years back (but those were just pleasant scents for the car and home). Therefore, this price seems shocking ... especially since you need a new insert each night. (Mine came with four, not twelve as mentioned here).    It also seems to have a very, very limited range. We have a standard-sized master-bedroom, so after an hour, I asked my boyfriend if he could smell the product (because I could not). He said he didn&#x27;t even know that I plugged it in. I went into the bathroom, brushed, moisturized, etc. I thought that when I emerged, the smell would be noticeable. Not a bit. Nonetheless, when I walked over to the wall where it was plugged in, I could finally smell it. I removed the device and made certain it was on the highest setting ... it was. So, in a small area of the room, it was noticeable, but not elsewhere. Now, it may be a big bedroom, but it is not so big that the scent should become lost. Disappointing.    Here is what I was most interested in when ordering this: are these genuine essential oils ... or just fragrance. Now, I had a bad feeling when I opened the pad ... something did not smell \\&quot;quite right\\&quot;. (They did not smell like true lavender and chamomile). So, I scoured the package and the materials: nowhere does it indicate that these are true oils. Obviously, it&#x27;s much cheaper to use \\&quot;fragrances,\\&quot; but any potential therapeutic quality is then eliminated. And, products that do use genuine, 100% essential oils proudly mark their merchandise as such (because those components are expensive and because customers KNOW to look for that).    If you really want to experiment with essential oils like lavender and chamomile (asa natural remedy for sleeplessness), buy a diffuser (this one is FANTASTIC: [[ASIN:B00NUSH4EE AromaFresh Ripple Handmade Ceramic Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser, 100 ML]] and it doubles as a humidifier ... it is so amazing!!) and pick up a 100% essential oil of lavender and/or chamomile (like this: [[ASIN:B001DJ6J0C Aura Cacia Essential Oil, Lavender, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]]). It may seem expensive at first, but it is cheaper in the long run, chemical-free, and MIGHT TRULY help.    Unless you are seeking a very expensive air-freshener, look elsewhere.    (And, do understand that this is not a \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; product. The box clearly states that there is no \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; on these pads ... so understand that this is not a form of NyQuil or ZzzQuil).</li>
    <li> I used to use similar product for treating nasal congestion, and likes it quite a lot, so I was very curious to try ZzzQuil. There is two spaces for putting in the scented pads inside the device, you can use one or two pads. After inserting the pad, you can adjust the strength - there were three different settings. I am using only one pad, and the lightest setting. It smells rather nice, flowery. The smell is not too sweet. The package said each pad should last up to 16 hours on the lightest setting, but I could definitely smell it 24 hours after I first install it. The smell is not overpowering. I did sleep better on the nights I used it, but of course I cannot tell if it is due to the device use, or not. You know, placebo effect and such. What I did not like is that it is quite hard to replace pads without touching it and getting the oil on my hands.</li>
    <li> The fragrance was odd - it seemed to smell more like some type of soap than of lavender and chamomile.  The package only comes with four inserts and last only overnight. It seems very pricey for what you get and how the product works. The smell did not help me with my sleep and it didn&#x27;t last very long.  I have better luck with the fragrance set that comes from Bath and Bodyworks and those last for weeks and smell much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had difficulty figuring out how to open and insert the scent pads.  The manufacturer should have included a diagram.  I wasted one scent pad because I put in on the wrong side of the opening and then had to pull it out using tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because it physically worked and I generally save one star reviews for something that doesn&#x27;t work; however, I cannot see any situation in which I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The ZzzQuil Sleep Enhancer is an interesting idea. I&#x27;ve been battling sleep issues for as long as I can remember, Using pills, using relaxation techniques, natural aids. Nothing beyond Ambien really provided sleep support. But considering the addictive nature of Ambien, I always searching for alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sleep Enhancer was easy to unpack but I did find the pads rather difficult to install. The ZzzQuil Sleep Enhancer fills the room with a relaxing, sleep inducing scent that sometimes would distract me as I slept as my body was wondering what that foreign smell was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, did it work? I can&#x27;t really say. I didn&#x27;t sleep better but I also didn&#x27;t sleep worse. I didn&#x27;t find the scent bad but it did have a &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; kind of smell, so be warned there. I think it may take time and many nights to really see if it enhances your sleep.</li>
    <li> I received the ZzzQuil Scented Sleep Aid for review from Influenster.  I always have a horrible time falling alseep.  The scent is pleasant and it is soothing.  You do have to adjust the scent to your liking.  I had it stronger to over ride all the scents around me from my scentsy burners to incense.  I am a huge fan of using scents to influence life.  I slept pretty well using this item.  I still do not sleep soundly through the night, but that is just how I am programmed I think.  I had a hard time getting the slider to work on mine, but then again that could be user error as I was excited and rushing to get it plugged in and working.  Overall I love it, it helps a lot with relaxing me and has made it easier to fall asleep at night!!</li>
    <li> I received my ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Scented Sleep Enhancer from Influenster to test and review this product. Since I am someone who really struggles with good sleep I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product. I often try any new sleep enhancement products that come out. The ZzzQuil Scented Sleep Aid really was better than I was expecting. It smells so awesome and when I used it for the first time my husband and I both slept like babies. I would very much like to use this product on a daily basis. The only down side for me is I haven&#x27;t been able to find the refill pads anywhere yet. I like definitely keep looking till I find them.&lt;br /&gt;#influentster</li>
    <li> I was really surprised by this product. The smell isn&#x27;t to strong and does actually help you sleep. That was one of my worries about a sleep aid, does it really work! Yes it does!!</li>
    <li> I simply loved this product. The scent is soothing and not overpowering. I only had to set it at the lowest point to acheive a comfortable level. There are 3 adjustments and the box comes with 4 scent pads. Each pad last approximately 8 hours, so one pad per night. Make sure you put it in the outlet closest to you and try not to overly touch the pad. Note: I received a complimentary product for use and review.</li>
    <li> I received my ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Scented Sleep Enhancer from Influenster to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried a plug in sleep aid before but I have been having problems sleeping for weeks so I was up to trying the ZzzQuil. When I first put the pad in (I  put one in), it was kinda strong but after about thirty minutes I got use to the lavender and chamomile smell.  The smell lasted throughout the night.  I  did sleep much better and only woke up once throughout the night vs. 3 or 4 times like I usually do.  I feel that it did help!</li>
    <li> i got this for free to test from zzzquil.  i am a chronic insomniac and i felt that altho this really didn&#x27;t put me over the edge, it was helpful in the calming down process in a natural way.  the fragrance of lavender and chamomile was very soothing and relaxing, perfect for the end of any day.  my major complaint was hat it wasn&#x27;t strong enough coming from the electrical outlet.  i felt this unit needed to be either a table top unit, for night stand use OR the pods needed to have a stronger fragrance.  i still think the idea is good and will continue to use the unit that was given to me by the company - i will just try to squeeze extra pods into the unit to make the fragrance stronger.</li>
    <li> I received from my ZzzQuil Scented Sleep-Aid from Influenster free of charge for  testing and review. This Sleep-Aid came packaged with one plug in unit and 4  scented pads. I had to carefully insert the scented cartridge into the plug in  holder tray (without letting my fingers touch the pad) set the plug-in on the  intensity of my choice  (low, medium, or high) and plug it in the outlet closest  to me, the user.    I did as per the packages directions and this was my experience:    Night #1    I placed the unit in the outlet that was closest to me. Which is about 1 foot  away from the head of my bed. Because the scented pad seemed to be a little  strong when I opened the packet I decided to use only one for my first go round.  I also started out on the lowest setting. I figured if I needed a higher  intensity then I would just raise the bar. Once I plugged in the unit, it took  approximately about 15 minutes for the scent to begin spreading throughout the  room.    Initially the Lavender and chamomile scents are subtitle, but overtime the scent  became overpowering. Needless to say I had to turn off the unit because I had  become adversely effected by it. Both my eyes and chest/lungs became irritated  and it was almost as if I was using a vaporizer and poured  too much menthol  solution in it or something. Because of my level of irritation I could not sleep  with the unit. I presumed that the unit was too close and decided that I would  allow myself to get adjusted and try again another night.    Night #2  I again started with a fresh scented tab. Because of my initial experience I  started out with one scented tab on the lowest setting. I then placed the unit  in a outlet that was further away (approximately 2 feet away from the foot of  the bed)    Of course now the unit was too far away for me to enjoy the effects with just  one tab inserted therefore I first increased the intensity to maximum and then  wound up adding an additional tab. I closed my bedroom door and waited for the  sleep scented sleep aid to \\&quot;kick in\\&quot;.    I must stay that the results were  surprising. I DID GET A FULL NIGHTS SLEEP!!!    adding a little back drop about myself, I normally find that I get up at around  3am unable to fall asleep again until about maybe 5-ish. However this time I  awakened, used the rest room (TMI) and went right back to sleep.    I also love using scented candles to create a relaxing and soothing environment.  I may fall asleep with them but of course i could never get restful sleep with  the idea that a candle is actively burning so i wind up getting up to blow it  out. Anywho, with the scented sleep aid, I did not have to worry about blowing  out any candle and once adjusted to my personal preferred setting, I was able to  have a comfortable and restful nights sleep.    I definitely would use this scented sleep aid again.    Pros:  I does help create an environment soothing enough to get restful sleep.    Cons:  It has to be used in a room that is large enough to give adequate space between  the user and the unit.    The lavender scent can be over powering which can be more annoying than useful.  I could not use the device to help my sleep during the first night because the  scent was strong enough to affect me in a negative way. However, i found the  unit to be very useful and positively effective.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample for review. I was HIGHLY disappointed with this product. I have the Vicks Vapor plug and LOVE it. I was hoping for the similar, positive experience with the sleep aid. I noticed no difference in my sleep. I still woke up about 2 hours before I needed to and still couldn&#x27;t go back to sleep.  I never even noticed the scent it had until I walked past it. :( Don&#x27;t spend your money on it.</li>
    <li> ZzzQuil Plugged in Lavender and Chamomile Sleep Enhancer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not care for these at all.  Flimsy container, scent didn’yt last for long, would not buy.  I prefer the Glade or the Frebreeze, but they are more expensive, but I’m worth it. Aren&#x27;t you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GUNNER  JANUARY, 2015</li>
