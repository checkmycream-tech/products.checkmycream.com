      <li>Not my favorite makeup bag.</li>
      <li>&amp; an additional larger elastic on the flap that covers the brushes that is perfect for a mini kabuki brushes.</li>
      <li>Probably the last since it&#x27;s perfectly what I needed.</li>
      <li>If you just google this bag you can find more pictures.</li>
      <li>couple spaces for brushes, it expands if you want to put more stuff in...</li>
      <li>I love this cosmetic bag/ organizer.  </li>
      <li>I gave 4 stars because when I put brushes in the holders the heads got smooshed and that bothers me, so I put them in the zipper pocket and that was better.</li>
      <li>Needed better description and pictures.  </li>
      <li>Much more flimsy.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I did not read that review until after I had ordered the bag.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>So I moved things around and still wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Everything will fit nicely and will stay put.</li>
      <li>The one thing that made me nervous about purchasing this bag though it that my brushes would be too tall to fit!</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s perfect for when I need to take only my must-have essentials.</li>
      <li>Can hold lots of items and love the section for the brushes.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite items.</li>
      <li>Love it :)</li>
      <li>Super handy,  space efficient, and</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;features/specifications&amp;#34; describing the bag were accurate but both the picture and the price suggested a bag of much better quality.  </li>
      <li>I am able to fit all my essentials (travel sized for the most part) into this little bag and not even have to expand it.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very nice to carry all your Bare Escentuals Make-Up in!!!</li>
      <li>It is great for keeping all your Bare Escentuals makeup organized.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect and I now keep my make-up in the little brown pouch all of the time.  </li>
      <li>I want to be able to reach in and know if I&#x27;m touching my glasses case, make up case, smart phone, etc.</li>
      <li>Great as a travel bag for personal makeup when I&#x27;m staying away from home for a while.  </li>
      <li>The price was really great with it being $6.79 when the regular price is $25 from BE.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>My order was filled incorrectly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about make up honestly</li>
      <li>great basic makeup bag to keep your portable stuff in.  </li>
      <li>Easy to wipe clean.</li>
      <li>collapsable zip works for light or, em,</li>
      <li>I know that I have mentioned a fair share of cons about this product, but honestly, for the price, it really is a bargain for a great travel makeup bag where I can have all my makeup in one place (except for my bigger brushes) and be able to see it with the plastic cover (unlike with regular bags where you have to meddle through everything to find your mascara).</li>
      <li>The alternative would be mesh, but I think the version I received is much easier to clean! :)    </li>
      <li>Light weight, easy to store, and just the right amount of space.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with my this Bare Escentuals expandable makeup bag.  </li>
      <li>It was not what I expected but it really is great.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is a good quality makeup bag</li>
      <li>The bag is well designed, zippers are good quality, and I personally like the brown color.</li>
      <li>Also you can double up brushes in the elastics to make them fit more snug and to put more in it.</li>
      <li>Love that has a zipper around to expand it when needed and make it very compact for travel when needed.  </li>
      <li>At first it seemed too small but when the zipper expanded it was the perfect size.</li>
      <li>...carry in your purse for those quick touch-ups.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s small enough to squeeze into my over packed luggage or purse and big enough to fit all of my makeup essentials.</li>
    <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t buy a expandable makeup bag priced below $5?! I now know where to go when I need new makeup bags and I don&#x27;t have to send over $10. Shipped fast as well</li>
    <li> Very speedy shipping! Received in 2 days!!! Bigger than expected! Makes a great gift for mothers day (:! Light weight, easy to store, and just the right amount of space.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a simple make up bag that could keep my brushes separate from my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;This make up bag was perfect for it. I  don&#x27;t like opening up the extension because it makes the bag seem a bit flimsy. If you are someone who is going to carry a lot of make up this probably isnt the bag for you, but if you just need it for the basics  (powder,blush,mascara, eyeliner, concealer, lip balm ...) then this bag is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Use it every day and for travel.</li>
    <li> This is a nice travel size makeup bag. It stores plenty for short trips. The photo was a little deceiving. I wished I had actually read the dimensions of the product prior to purchasing because I needed a bigger sized bag. However, it did give me some justice for my shorter trips.</li>
    <li> All brushes fit good and all my other essential fit well. I would recommend it to any just starting out with bare minerals make up.</li>
    <li> This is a great product it was exactly what I was after, great size and easy to use.. Love it :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this bag as a gift.  I haven&#x27;t given it to her yet, but I think she will love it.  I previously ordered one for myself and it is perfect for all my makeup products as well as the brushes and small mirror.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought it was going to be, but a great addition to my makeup carriers! It&#x27;s actually helping me condence what I have, and what I don&#x27;t need! Lots of slots for makeup brushes (I think 6), and room for my four powder containers, as well as two eyeshadow cases and eyeliners. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> My wife thought this was going to be like the one she bought at the BE store.  Turns out, this is much smaller and can barely fit 2 brushes, let alone the 5 she fits in her other bag.  We were planning on giving this as a gift, but now it&#x27;s buried in a cupboard.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my this Bare Escentuals expandable makeup bag.  I can fit all of my cosmetics and brushes I need for my basic face. I keep this under the bathroom sink on top of my larger makeup case.  I work out of this small bag on a daily basis.  When I am running late, I toss it in my tote for on the go makeup appllication. The bag is well designed, zippers are good quality, and I personally like the brown color. I looked awhile before finding this bag.  The price was great, and mine even came with a small green mineral powder brush. I viewed a video before deciding on this bag.  It really does expand to fit quite a bit of make-up.  In my bag today: powder foundation compact,eye brow powder compact, two eyeshadow compacts, eyeliner pencil, eyelash curler, full size mascara, blush compact, bronzer compact, tube of eyeshadow base.  Foundation brush, brow brush, eyeshadow brush, eyeliner brush, sponge tip blender tool, blush brush, In a small snack size zip-lock bag, eye pencil sharpener, a few sponge tip applicators, old clean mascara wand for unclumping wet mascara. And, I still have room!  Easy to wipe clean. Definitely would purchase again, or give as a gift.</li>
    <li> I like it because it is very light in weight.  It is as described. I would highly recommend it unless you carry really small purses/clutches.</li>
    <li> This bag is exactly what I was looking for! Now i don&#x27;t need a separate bag for my brushes or have to worry about putting them with the rest of my makeup!    I think the version of this bag that I received may have been an update to the one the previous reviewer was sent. Instead of pockets for brushes there are 6 elastics of varying widths attached to it. &amp; an additional larger elastic on the flap that covers the brushes that is perfect for a mini kabuki brushes. Also you can double up brushes in the elastics to make them fit more snug and to put more in it. You can also stick mascara or eyeliner tubes in them :) very handy!    The compartment where I stick my makeup in is also different...I saw on another website of pictures of the interior of this bag, and I know there are two or three different versions. The place where I keep makeup has a clear plastic material with a zipper. The alternative would be mesh, but I think the version I received is much easier to clean! :)    The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I know that a lot of people prefer more decorated or colorful makeup bags. HOWEVER, I check on a couple other websites and they have different special editions of this bag for a little bit more $$$. However,  I think that the brown is less juvenile than the colorful versions.    When it says Expandable on the name of the product. It means it! I can fit a pretty decent of amount of makeup in here!    The one thing that made me nervous about purchasing this bag though it that my brushes would be too tall to fit! I have the MAC 239 AND 224 brushes and they fit perfectly! :)</li>
    <li> This product was the perfect solution to my travel needs. The selection afforded by Amazon allowed me to choose the perfect item. Excellent quality and great design.</li>
    <li> ...carry in your purse for those quick touch-ups. I like that it takes up little space in my bag and that it holds enough product to be practical. However, this is NOT the case for you if you&#x27;re looking for genuine storage, on a long trip, or want to carry every full size brush you own. Check the dimensions, then double-check &#x27;em! It&#x27;s small and the photo is deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight, soft nylon is sturdy but not stiff&lt;br /&gt;Zippered netted pocket easily holds 2 full sz jars plus 2-3 eyeshadows/smaller jars plus a few extra slim brushes&lt;br /&gt;Brown color makes it look less like a cheap camera bag&lt;br /&gt;Expandable/collapsable zip works for light or, em, even lighter days&lt;br /&gt;Relatively inexpensive for a Bare Minerals branded product&lt;br /&gt;5 brush pockets....see below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Out of 5 brush pockets, warning- only 2 hold the standard handle brushes!! TWO. The rest are clearly meant for eyeshadow brushes&lt;br /&gt;Dark color means the typical Bare Minerals &#x27;dust&#x27; will show all over it, requires constant wiping&lt;br /&gt;Too small for a trip, not enough space for full size jars and standard, not slim brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/19/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well has only been a few months since my review and sadly, even with gentle care the inside zipper has broken. It did that weird thing where it looks securely zipped but you can pull it apart at the zip &#x27;seam&#x27; with your fingers. My hubby tried to fix it but it promptly broke again. It still runs bath and forth like a zipper, it just won&#x27;t actually zip. I didn&#x27;t pay much for this so no big loss..but I see they&#x27;ve hiked the price. So beware. Just trusting the main outside zipper is not enough. The inside zipper is a netted pocket, keeping those messy, pesky jars secure.  Which, no pun intended, is an ESSENTIAL  part of a good cosmetic bag. :-(</li>
    <li> I love this bag!  Perfect size, and you can make it bigger too! holds everything from my setting spray to my eyelash curler.  Even a place for the brushes, so they don&#x27;t have to roll around in everything. Easy to clean, small enough to through in a purse and take with you!  Perfect.  Wish it came is funner colors but LOVE this!</li>
    <li> Okay bag so far. Kind of small but not bad for the price. If you have a lot of makeup don&#x27;t buy this bag. Purchase something bigger. If You have a few items then you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
    <li> This bag has worked well for me. The material can have stray make up washed off. I would recommmend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing bag for putting all my makeup travel essentials. At first it seemed too small but when the zipper expanded it was the perfect size. To the people who say all their makeup does not fit in this bag: note that this is a travel bag. Obviously if I tried to put all my makeup in there I wouldn&#x27;t be able to – that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s perfect for when I need to take only my must-have essentials. It doesn&#x27;t fit my real techniques brushes with a wider handle, but it doesn&#x27;t detract from the overall product experience. Another thing is that it would be awesome if there was a handle on the top of the bag. Also, the material does not seem too sturdy and the zipper threatens to get stuck at any moment. I know that I have mentioned a fair share of cons about this product, but honestly, for the price, it really is a bargain for a great travel makeup bag where I can have all my makeup in one place (except for my bigger brushes) and be able to see it with the plastic cover (unlike with regular bags where you have to meddle through everything to find your mascara). Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t give this bag less than five stars because it arrived exactly when it said it would and it served its purpose for me, not to mention that it&#x27;s sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much space in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> Love this make-up bag!!!  Has dfferent compartments and sections for different items!!!  Very nice to carry all your Bare Escentuals Make-Up in!!!</li>
    <li> I could put all my domestic in this kit but my Korean bb cream lol. It&#x27;s really nice kit for a girl who just needs daily make up stuff</li>
    <li> Love that it has a space for my brushes and the zipper compartment is clear so you can see everything you have</li>
    <li> Not like the picture.  Much more flimsy.  I like it though.  Great for the price and holds everything I needed it to hold.  Fits good in my purse too.  Not too big and not too small.  :P</li>
    <li> I love this cosmetic bag/ organizer.  Everything fits just right.  I will definitely be purchasing again in the near future or purchase one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Bought at wife&#x27;s request. Good quality, was the size she wanted. Nothing negative to say.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it is intended to do.</li>
    <li> Use this case all the time. Love that has a zipper around to expand it when needed and make it very compact for travel when needed.  very convenient.</li>
    <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a make-up bag. It&#x27;s affordable and expandable. It opens up and on the left is a spot for your brushes. On the right is a zippered off area for storage. Everything like it was double the price and didn&#x27;t have an expandable area. If you just google this bag you can find more pictures. I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This makeup bag is nice and I like a lot but its extremely small. Although I make good use of it. love the brown color on the outside of this makeup bag overall I make good use of this makeup bag. But I must tell u to this bag is not that pratical. Kristen</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I realized. Not my favorite makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a different makeup bag from Bare Escentuals.  It was smaller than what&lt;br /&gt;I needed.  When it arrived, I realized my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;the seller accepted the return and refunded my money.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup bag, just the right size, I orginally got this to take on trips, but I am using it everyday.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this case! I travel some with my job and many times found other makeup cases bulky and taking up too much room in my luggage. I recently had two back to back trips and used this case for my makeup. The absolutely only reason that I did not give this 5 stars is because the little slots for you to store brushes in aggravated me. The elastic slots were a little large for eye shadow, eye brow, and eye liner brushes. I solved this problem/aggravation by putting 2 in each slot. No big deal really; I just wish that a few of the slots were a little smaller is all. If you need a travel bag for your Bare Escentuals or even for your non Bare Minerals makeup, get this one...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;features/specifications&amp;#34; describing the bag were accurate but both the picture and the price suggested a bag of much better quality.  I fear with regular daily use this bag will not last long.</li>
    <li> At first I was disappointed because it appeared to be so small, but once I started putting my make-up in it, I was very pleased with the bag. It organizes my make-up for me and while not the most stylish thing on the planet the price was amazing. I love it.</li>
    <li> This was my go to make up bag and I have ordered it twice. It has now ripped again and now the price is much higher! I will unfortunately have to look for another bag</li>
    <li> Bigger than looks. Good size. Clear compartment so easy to find right makeup. Holds brushes in individual slots. Great for travel</li>
    <li> Makeup bag is not exactly what I wanted, but will definitely use it when I travel. Everything will fit nicely and will stay put.</li>
    <li> This expands enough to hold the larger jars of Bare Minerals, as well as all the smaller jars and even your brushes. Very handy when traveling. Or could even be an every day use makeup bag if you wish.</li>
    <li> I picked this up for not a whole lot of cash but it has proven to be really useful. I have noticed that the stretchy fabric piece that holds the &amp;#34;protected&amp;#34; compartment in has stretched a bit, but it still holds my Transformer tablet in just fine while keeping my gym clothes/other stuff stored in the main compartment.</li>
    <li> Nice bag for brushes.  easy to pack or just hold all of your bigger brushes at home. I have two</li>
    <li> I have to totally disagree with the person who said the picture is deceiving and the bag is too small. I was so surprised when it was delivered. It is big enough to hold ALL of my makeup and ALL of my brushes and that&#x27;s not an easy thing to do. I have 5 of the big brushes, you know like the ones you apply foundation, mineral veil, blush, Luminizer, etc. It has slots big enough for all of them. And I am a Bareminerals collector. I have it all and it all fits in this bag. I am so glad I did not read that review until after I had ordered the bag. Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I use this bag when I travel. It holds brushes well and since it&#x27;s expandable it also holds a lot of makeup. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected it to be. Wonderful for make up and lots of space and lots of room for expansion. I gave 4 stars because when I put brushes in the holders the heads got smooshed and that bothers me, so I put them in the zipper pocket and that was better. I don&#x27;t know if you are supposed to put them in those though. I don&#x27;t know much about make up honestly and this is the first make up bag I have ever owned. Probably the last since it&#x27;s perfectly what I needed. It&#x27;s about the size of a woman&#x27;s hand, maybe a little larger depending on how big your hands are.</li>
    <li> My order was filled incorrectly.  Rec&#x27;d only one, ordered 2 but the company refunded me for the one missing as they had sold out.  To error is human so not going to give a bad review for one mistake.  Would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> The bag is flimsy. The part where you store the makeup is not easy to get into. Needs to be redesigned. Just don&#x27;t like it at all. :( I&#x27;m dissappionted because I am a huge Bare Escentuals fan and this bag really let me down.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly impressed with this bag! I was expecting it to be rather small but it is very large and very spacious. Definitely a must have for anyone who uses Bare Minerals makeup set, because if you are like me and want to keep the little compacts in an upright position, this is the perfect way to ensure that.</li>
    <li> Pocket was frayed on edged, so it wouldn&#x27;t close and everything falls out.  I wasn&#x27;t given a receipt so I am unable to return it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple cosmetic case and I bought this.  It&#x27;s great so far, the zippers were a little difficult at first but I think with usage, it will wear down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this is the thickness of the layers.  I would have liked more and maybe more compartments because it looks like it has a lot of space to have more.  But I&#x27;m quite satisfied and would definitely recommend this to other customers.</li>
    <li> I really like the bag and it holds almost everything I need.  Just wish it would hold a little bit more.  I would love to be able to add eye shadow, liner and mascara to the case..</li>
    <li> Nice look and feel. Ample space for credit cards and pockets are spacious.  Like so far. One of my favorite items.</li>
    <li> I do like this make-up bag.  It&#x27;s compact yet holds a lot. Ironically, a seam that separates the brushes ripped today.  Not the end of the world especially given the cost of the bag.</li>
    <li> Useful makeup bag. I purchased this one for my teenage granddaughter. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Great as a travel bag for personal makeup when I&#x27;m staying away from home for a while.  Can hold lots of items and love the section for the brushes.</li>
    <li> Love my new little travel make-up bag.  At first it seemed a bit small mostly based on my expectations.  I loaded my products into it and found it a bit snug.  So I moved things around and still wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied.  Then I remembered the zipper that allows for an additional inch of expansion.  It&#x27;s perfect and I now keep my make-up in the little brown pouch all of the time.  Good job Bare Escentuals!</li>
    <li> great basic makeup bag to keep your portable stuff in.  I bought this for the car, the \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; kit and it works great. couple spaces for brushes, it expands if you want to put more stuff in... it&#x27;s just a basic bag, but has a couple bonuses.</li>
    <li> The make-up bag is great. It is a little larger than I would have thought but this is good as I was concerned it would be too small. It easily holds the Bare Esentuals brushes, powder, all-over face color and mineral veil, plus several eye shadows. The quality of it is decent, not the best, but for the price I wouldn&#x27;t expect more.</li>
    <li> Hold lots of stuff! Good even for products other than Bare Minerals (or a combination of the two)! Ok, so it won&#x27;t fit into a small purse but I gave up on them a long time ago. It fits well one size up and above....also in a brief case. I&#x27;m weird, I like organization! I want to be able to reach in and know if I&#x27;m touching my glasses case, make up case, smart phone, etc.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting this makeup bag for some time and had looked at it numerous times on the BE website. I was under the mistaken impression that it was much larger than it actually is. However, this is likely my fault. It is hard to understand dimensions online. Overall, this is a good quality makeup bag and I really like it. I think I will use it for travel. The price was really great with it being $6.79 when the regular price is $25 from BE.</li>
    <li> Before I became a lipstick and eyeshadow hoarder, I used this to store all my brushes and makeup. Now I just use it when I&#x27;m traveling. It&#x27;s big enough to hold all the basics -- I can fit the six brushes I use,  my primer, my foundation, two blushes, contour-er, highlighter, and mineral veil, along with a few small eyeshadow palettes without overstuffing it. Sometimes I end up overstuffing it (makeup is like clothes! You don&#x27;t know what you might want or need to wear! Really!), but it&#x27;s never broken and I&#x27;ve had it for probably at least five years. It&#x27;s a good bag for when I&#x27;m just staying somewhere for a night or two.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected but it really is great.  Got it super quick.&lt;br /&gt;My friend has a bare escentials bag and it has little compartments. Mine just has one compartment</li>
    <li> I do not like to carry tons of makeup when I travel, but this perfectly fits all of my BE brushes and powders. I can even fit my eyeshadow compact, mascara, eyeliners, and a few other essentials. The expander portion is really great when you want to make sure you have everything you need. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> It was not the one I thought it was.  Needed better description and pictures.  The bag itself was in great condition, just not what I wanted</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use Bare Escentuals, but this seemed like it might be a nice replacement for the make-up bag I&#x27;d been toting around in my purse. I travel a bit, so I keep pretty much everything in there. The front of the bag holds my liners, concealer, mascara, nail file/clippers, tweezers and some hair pins. The larger compartment holds pressed powder, blush, a kabuki brush,  an eyeshadow pot, my contact case, Neosporin, a mini hair claw, my spare e-cig capsules, and some extra jewelery. I expand the compartment when I want to dig around in it, then zip it/collapse it before I put it back in my purse. Super handy,  space efficient, and the chocolate brown fabric with small rose-colored accents is quite tasteful and seems to be made of material that will wipe clean well.</li>
    <li> The bag I received is the same size, color and outside appearance- However, on the inside, the zippered compartment is Netted- not clear plastic like in the photo. As well, the other side has Pockets- not stretchy holder rings. There isn&#x27;t a large ring on the protective flap either. I had to cut open two of the smaller pockets to make one big one, which tore the material. Speaking of material- the polyester is flimsy and has already torn in a couple of places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the bag is too small to fit my daily carry-along items, and I could have paid less for something better. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bag because my old bag was looking pretty rough and the zipper had broken. This bag fit all of my brushes and my Bare Minerals makeup I take on the go. I love this bag! It was a great buy!</li>
    <li> Roomy, but flimsy sides, and no liner, so if it gets wet sitting by the sink then your makeup will get wet, too.</li>
    <li> Great makeup bag. Love the color, wish the elastic holders for brushes/makeup were a little smaller but I just double things up. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This little bag is great. It is surprising how much it holds for such a small bag.  Not expanded it easily holds large size foundation, radiance, mineral veil, small blush, and four eye shadows on one side and on the other side it has elastic band slots that hold a large kabuki brush, and slots for several other application brushes.  It is great for keeping all your Bare Escentuals makeup organized.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Exactly like the original black one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and bought this as a small toiletries bag to keep on my backpack for those random times when I find myself not at home for a couple days. I am able to fit all my essentials (travel sized for the most part) into this little bag and not even have to expand it.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hold makeup?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure,but I wouldn&#x27;t know about that.</li>
    <li> This bag is absolutely essential for any girl who likes to wear makeup!! It&#x27;s great to carry in my purse so I can do touch ups throughout the day, and it&#x27;s also great to store all my brushes in a neat manner, so they stay nice and clean.  This makeup bag holds A LOT more than you would initially think.  I have 4 brushes, a pair of tweezers, like 6 or 7 different eyeliners, my mineral foundation, my mineral veil, my moisturizer, a mirror,  and a couple other things.  It&#x27;s truly amazing!</li>
    <li> What was a turn off for me when I actually saw this makeup bag was that there is no handle on it.  Outside of that it is Okay</li>
    <li> Holds the right amount of makeup to take with you especially on vacation.  Keeps your brushes and eyebrow pencils/lip liner in separate place.</li>
    <li> I use Bare Escentuals products.  When I saw this bag offered, I decided to try it.  It is expandable and I have used it many times already.</li>
