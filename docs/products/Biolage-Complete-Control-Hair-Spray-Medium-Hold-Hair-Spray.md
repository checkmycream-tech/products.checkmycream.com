### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I love everything biolage!!!!</li>
      <li>I remember Biolage as smelling good!</li>
      <li>This is a great hairspray it does the job.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>though when I take care to do oil masks twice per month and use a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t think the quality would be as good as a salon purchase, and was convinced the product wouldn&#x27;t arrive in good shape or on time.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased with product.</li>
      <li>I love the hold this spray gives, however, the smell isn&#x27;t very nice.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled after trying it:</li>
      <li>She is thrilled with the hair spray and with the Amazon service.</li>
      <li>We also liked having the ability to just click, order and pick it up at the front door.</li>
      <li>Great job Matrix Biolage, and thanks, Amazon!</li>
      <li>Huge plus!</li>
      <li>Love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>I will deffinitely buy it again when I need more.</li>
      <li>Love the hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I wish they could make it smell better.</li>
      <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>Love this hair spray.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be so glad you used all the Biolage products on your hair.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be so glad you did .....</li>
      <li>Love this hair spray.</li>
      <li>I love this hair spray.  </li>
      <li>but this is so light and refreshing</li>
      <li>Easy to brush out without leaving a sticky residue.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-You can layer it on more for added hold or just a light spritz for a normal day/style&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll have fists full of lather</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different hairsprays from the high end to the low end trying to find that perfect balance between hold and breakage and</li>
      <li>Because of this it breaks pretty easily if I don&#x27;t take care of it with the right products.</li>
      <li>finally a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t break my hair and has respectable hold!  </li>
      <li>Worth the splurge.</li>
      <li>It holds your hair in place without making it stiff and it has a great fragrance too.</li>
      <li>This MATRIX BIOILAGE spray is just right.</li>
      <li>When the hairspray I used for decades added &amp;#34;a touch of conditioning&amp;#34; and essentially ruined the product by adding water to combat VOCs, I purchased what seems like dozens of hairsprays to find a suitable replacement.  </li>
      <li>This product is light, no build- up, not sticky, hair stays soft and in place.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It is pricier than the spray I formerly used, but prices on Amazon are better than I find in stores.  </li>
      <li>pretty girl.</li>
      <li>It adds such body to my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>well enough for loose curls, up-dos, and adds good volume</li>
      <li>Matrix products are reasonably priced so get the whole series.</li>
      <li>Biolage hair spray is hard to find, so it was nice to find it on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>I have been unable to find it in my salon and was so happy to see it on your site.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Not sticky at all, no residue, no dull buildup over time</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and hard to keep in place.</li>
      <li>Not stiff at all but holds the curl or body in hair.</li>
      <li>, a little conditioner worked in and you&#x27;ll have silky, smooth hair and a medium spray held about 8&amp;#34; from your head</li>
      <li>If you buy this buy it from your stylist or a hair supply store because this stuff is so old it must have ruined in storage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-I am sensitive to fragrance</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know a person who is truly beauty conscious that can go without aerosol hairspray.</li>
      <li>I saw an ad for Biolage Complete Control Hairspray indicating that it contained no water.  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally blonde, fine, and down to my shoulder blades (Long).</li>
      <li>Even old line hairsprays seem to have all had  water added to their list of ingredients, every one of which which caused my hair to frizz, break, and definitely not hold my hairstyle.  </li>
      <li>I bought all 3 at the same time: Biolage Shampoo, Conditioner and the Biolage Complete Control Hair Spray by Matrix for Unisex.  </li>
      <li>Just the right hold without making my hair stiff.  </li>

<li> Unfortunately, my extra fine hair needs a hairspray to look at all presentable, and it needs a medium hold spray that isn&#x27;t too difficult to brush through, and that does NOT have water added.  </li>
<li> This one doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> I have used this product for quite a few years, and find it holds hard, but brushes out to leave hair soft, but manageable, since it remains on the hair, and I can then tease it a bit, or style it with a flatiron, and it retains some shape and substance.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair as stiff and hard to manage as my old hairspray.</li>
<li> Just a little shampoo</li>
<li> There is the stiff, heavy spray where you&#x27;re hair won&#x27;t move.</li>
<li> It holds our hair in place without making it feel too stiff or stickky.</li>
<li> Hair seems a bit sticky and dull after using.  </li>
<li> Without getting to sticky or making your hair look dull</li>
<li> I can shake my fingers throughout my hair at night to reduce breakage then just thick comb in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Seriously, these hair product companies need to take a clue from Matrix and find a way to combat VOC&#x27;s without adding water.</li>
<li> However, this had a dank, rank sweaty arm pit, smelly dirty foot odor underneath the coconut and actually made me feel sick.</li>
<li> She was wrong on all three counts!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this hair spray. I have very fine hair and hard to keep in place. This product is light, no build- up, not sticky, hair stays soft and in place.</li>
    <li> Hairspray can either do or kill your hair style.  There is the stiff, heavy spray where you&#x27;re hair won&#x27;t move. This MATRIX BIOILAGE spray is just right. It holds your hair in place without making it stiff and it has a great fragrance too. I bought all 3 at the same time: Biolage Shampoo, Conditioner and the Biolage Complete Control Hair Spray by Matrix for Unisex.  Don&#x27;t mix your hair care products. Matrix products are reasonably priced so get the whole series. Just a little shampoo and you&#x27;ll have fists full of lather, a little conditioner worked in and you&#x27;ll have silky, smooth hair and a medium spray held about 8&amp;#34; from your head and you&#x27;ll be so glad you used all the Biolage products on your hair.  Stay with Matrix Biolage from shampoo through hair spray and you&#x27;ll be so glad you did ..... pretty girl.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray.  Just the right hold without making my hair stiff.  Easy to brush out without leaving a sticky residue.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my sister who is \\&quot;on-line\\&quot; gun-shy.  She didn&#x27;t think the quality would be as good as a salon purchase, and was convinced the product wouldn&#x27;t arrive in good shape or on time.  She was wrong on all three counts!  She is thrilled with the hair spray and with the Amazon service. This transaction definitely deserves 5-stars. My sister would give it 10 stars!</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray. Worth the splurge. Not stiff at all but holds the curl or body in hair.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I like this product and have used it for years. It holds our hair in place without making it feel too stiff or stickky. A little bit goes a long way. We also liked having the ability to just click, order and pick it up at the front door.</li>
    <li> I love everything biolage!!!! And I got this in 3 days! Huge plus!</li>
    <li> I love the hold this spray gives, however, the smell isn&#x27;t very nice.  I wish they could make it smell better.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair as stiff and hard to manage as my old hairspray. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite a few years, and find it holds hard, but brushes out to leave hair soft, but manageable, since it remains on the hair, and I can then tease it a bit, or style it with a flatiron, and it retains some shape and substance.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. Keeps my hair in place without feeling like a lacquer.  Does just what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.  Have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Hair seems a bit sticky and dull after using.  I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s the same as the Biolarge I have bought over the counter.</li>
    <li> Biolage hair spray is hard to find, so it was nice to find it on Amazon.com.  I will deffinitely buy it again when I need more.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally blonde, fine, and down to my shoulder blades (Long). Because of this it breaks pretty easily if I don&#x27;t take care of it with the right products. I have tried so many different hairsprays from the high end to the low end trying to find that perfect balance between hold and breakage and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Holds well enough for loose curls, up-dos, and adds good volume&lt;br /&gt;-Not sticky at all, no residue, no dull buildup over time&lt;br /&gt;-You can layer it on more for added hold or just a light spritz for a normal day/style&lt;br /&gt;-I am sensitive to fragrance but this is so light and refreshing it doesn&#x27;t bother me or follow me throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t give me split ends and to unstyle I can shake my fingers throughout my hair at night to reduce breakage then just thick comb in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It is aerosol hairspray so it still has alcohol in it which can be drying but I don&#x27;t know a person who is truly beauty conscious that can go without aerosol hairspray. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair though when I take care to do oil masks twice per month and use a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> When the hairspray I used for decades added &amp;#34;a touch of conditioning&amp;#34; and essentially ruined the product by adding water to combat VOCs, I purchased what seems like dozens of hairsprays to find a suitable replacement.  Even old line hairsprays seem to have all had  water added to their list of ingredients, every one of which which caused my hair to frizz, break, and definitely not hold my hairstyle.  Unfortunately, my extra fine hair needs a hairspray to look at all presentable, and it needs a medium hold spray that isn&#x27;t too difficult to brush through, and that does NOT have water added.  (The kind of hair that just looks dirty if I use a gel or mousse.)  At long last I saw an ad for Biolage Complete Control Hairspray indicating that it contained no water.  I was thrilled after trying it: finally a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t break my hair and has respectable hold!  It is pricier than the spray I formerly used, but prices on Amazon are better than I find in stores.  And well worth the cost for someone like me who has delicate hair that truly needs support and body.  Seriously, these hair product companies need to take a clue from Matrix and find a way to combat VOC&#x27;s without adding water. Great job Matrix Biolage, and thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a great hairspray it does the job. Without getting to sticky or making your hair look dull It was delivered on time and I will give it a 5 star rating ,</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray.  It adds such body to my fine hair.  I have been unable to find it in my salon and was so happy to see it on your site.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love the hairspray.  Have used it for years and it never leaves a buildup in my hair nor leaves a smell of perfume.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I remember Biolage as smelling good! However, this had a dank, rank sweaty arm pit, smelly dirty foot odor underneath the coconut and actually made me feel sick. I just trashed it instead of trying to return it. I do not recommend it at all! If you buy this buy it from your stylist or a hair supply store because this stuff is so old it must have ruined in storage.</li>
