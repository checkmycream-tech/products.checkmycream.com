      <li>It was amazing!</li>
      <li>They will not replace a bleaching kit, but they are a very mild abrasive and are excellent for those brown stains at the gum line.  </li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>

      <li>good for trying to clean your teeth in your own home</li>
      <li>Works great for general surface stains, but not as great for removing stains between teeth.</li>
      <li>I was driving one day and looked at my teeth in the mirror on my visor in the bright sun light</li>
      <li>but it is not the magic answer.  </li>
      <li>but I still think there&#x27;s a need for a better DIY system.</li>
      <li>i dont want to write 18 more words</li>
      <li>you have any sort of sensory issues with anything rubbing on your teeth, you might not be able to use it, depending on your tolerance level.</li>
      <li>Works okay on the front of my teeth where I have more control over the eraser.</li>
      <li>You may have to erase for 10 minutes or more but wat a difference.  </li>
      <li>You are better off getting sand paper and putting it on your teeth; That is basically what this is.  </li>
      <li>OK for the price.  </li>
      <li>I had two tobacco stains on my front top teeth for years.  </li>
      <li>I love it and would not go without one.</li>
      <li>I do not  think there is anything practical or appealing about this stain eraser.  </li>
      <li>This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for cleaning stains from the gum line and the spaces between my somewhat crooked teeth.</li>
      <li>UHHH, its okay, but not as results driven as I had imagined.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for removing stuff from your tooth surface..</li>
      <li>For the cost of this product, it worked pretty good and holds up quite well.  </li>
      <li>I take very good care of my teeth and am constantly ticked because the backs of my front teeth (top and bottom) get brown stains from espresso, tea and smoking.  </li>
      <li>have multiple causes, but this device is very good at solving the problem it solves.  </li>
      <li>This was the best $6 I have ever spent.  </li>
      <li>There is just nothing else quite like the &amp;#34;crumbly&amp;#34; tips on this stain removal tool to easily access the stained areas and &amp;#34;rub out&amp;#34; these stains.  </li>
      <li>(And it shipped fast, which is always nice. :) )</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe it was so easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have stains at the gum line - on the front of the teeth - easy to get to.</li>
      <li>This product is light and easy to use too</li>
      <li>Perfect for stubborn stains in tight areas.</li>
      <li>This stain remover is the first one I have tried and is good and does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure one would be able to clean their teeth before the whole thing wears down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was hoping that this item would clean the stains from my teeth</li>
      <li>But... it does erase it like it says it does, like a Mr. Clean Eraser for your teeth.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is true that it does not get into the cracks between teeth</li>
      <li>After receiving the Tooth Stain Eraser (in about 10 days), I was delighted to discover that this tool actually works to remove the stain!</li>
      <li>While it doesn&#x27;t replace the hygienist it can give you a quick polish</li>
      <li>This product is a mild abrasive.</li>
      <li>I think this product is very effective for spot stains on the surface of teeth, not fixing general yellowing of teeth caused by smoking, a bleaching kit is likely better suited for that.</li>
      <li>The tip to fit in between your teeth chipped off moments after I first tried it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require much pressure.  </li>
      <li>The texture is not &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; like I thought it would be, it was more &amp;#34;gritty,&amp;#34; but it was a fine enough grit for me to not be bothered by it</li>
      <li>This is pretty cool.</li>
      <li>I can finally smile and have conversations</li>
      <li>This tool has saved my smile.  </li>
      <li>But, at this price, its worth a try for you.  </li>
      <li>Ok I was a bit over dramatic but this stuff works great.</li>
      <li>oh,so right .</li>
      <li>It can only clean smooth surfaced though and will not get in-between the teeth.</li>
      <li>They seemed like they were working when I first started using them, but I haven&#x27;t been consistent.</li>
      <li>My teeth were visabily whiter after just the first use.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get rid of yellow teeth, but top surface stains.</li>
      <li>I really like this one!</li>
      <li>Very impressed, especially after all the whitening and stain toothpaste I have tried in the past.  </li>
      <li>I expected the eraser to remove my stains, and it does to some degree, but not quite as well as I would have liked.  </li>
      <li>I drink hot tea and it leaves stains between my teeth.</li>
      <li>Shape makes it for use on front of teeth only for the most part.</li>
      <li>wanted to order more because they were only $1.08 each but can&#x27;t find that price anymore.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s two sides, one side for between teeth, and another side better for working on the flat surfaces.</li>
      <li>It was OK, but the tips are not very strong, but it does clean the stains that I had on my teeth.</li>
      <li>This also really didn&#x27;t bother me very much because when I&#x27;m done using the product, I can brush and if I need to, floss to get it out.</li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;ve been smoking for about 12yrs and was highly upset that smoking had sacrificed my smile.</li>
      <li>This little wonder is compact, light, simple and, most importantly, it does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>It does work, but the heads seem to wear down more quickly than I thought they would.</li>
      <li>They were dark and visible when I smiled.  </li>
      <li>It should last for a good long time.</li>
      <li>Good for tough stains like coffee and wine, works out pretty well!</li>
      <li>Believe it or not this handy little tool works.  </li>
      <li>I just wish they made one a little more narrow to fit between the teeth a bit better.  </li>
      <li>Used with a powdered tooth scrubber and it worked very well.  </li>
      <li>and I really wish I could post a before and after picture.</li>
      <li>I wish I could yell to the whole world</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product for removing tobacco stains!</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like the eraser stuff in my mouth after use.  </li>
      <li>It really does erase stains from your teeth.  </li>
      <li>I was persistent and worked on it for 3 days straight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely Hate It....not only is this product unexpectedly tiny...it is not functional at all!!! The eraser part of it breaks away when it becomes moisten then it leaves its debree all over your teeth!!!!!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. Black particles from the product keep chipping off slowly, which I don&#x27;t like. Overall it is a decent product.</li>
    <li> It does work well.  I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> The dark gray eraser/tip of the tool comes off on your teeth.  The tip is much harder than what I thought it would be.  It might help a little bit but, I think my family will stick w/ the old fashioned whitening w/  mixture of baking soda and peroxide.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy these again, so I can&#x27;t recommend them to anyone else.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  They will not replace a bleaching kit, but they are a very mild abrasive and are excellent for those brown stains at the gum line.  As a coffee and soda drinker my dentist told me I would need 3-4 times a year cleanings which my insurance doesn&#x27;t cover.  I was driving one day and looked at my teeth in the mirror on my visor in the bright sun light and I about died with embarrassment over how gross my teeth looked at the gum line.  I made the appointment, had the out of pocket cleaning and even after that cleaning still had the brown gum line staining.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the dentists whitening kit so I went online and found the $14 kith they have here on Amazon with the blue mineralization gel and then I found this thing.  The bleach made my teeth white but left some blotching and still the brown at the gum-line.  At that point I used this device and this thing removed all of the brown, scaly nasty stuff from my gum-line and the blotchy look I had after bleaching.  I don&#x27;t think this would be a sole solution since discolored teeth have multiple causes, but this device is very good at solving the problem it solves.  I love it and would not go without one.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all.  The tip to fit in between your teeth chipped off moments after I first tried it.  I was looking forward to receiving it, but just contacted the seller to see about getting a refund.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical about this product, but was frustrated enough about some stains on my teeth to give it a try.  I just got some braces removed a month ago, and was displeased that the area near the gum line was slightly darker than the rest of the teeth, especially in the small triangle space between some teeth at the gum line. Even the dental hygienist was unable to remove the stain at a dental cleaning appointment. After receiving the Tooth Stain Eraser (in about 10 days), I was delighted to discover that this tool actually works to remove the stain! The narrow tips fit well into the triangle space between my teeth at the gum line. With just a little rubbing, the stain was gone! I definitely recommend giving this product a try if you have some frustrating stains.    A word of caution though...try to avoid rubbing your gums with this tool. Since I was cleaning stains at the gumline, some of my gums became tender about two days after using the tool. This was my fault for being so enthusiastic about the tool working so well. The next time I know to be a little more gentle with my erasing.</li>
    <li> Did not remove any stains for me, could tell no difference after use. Tips crumbled with pressure of use. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money... it did nothing for me! :(</li>
    <li> I have/had 3 badly tobacco stained teeth....front row bottom...I tried every product out there with no success. I can&#x27;t afford the dentist right now and would not smile because I was embarrassed by the ugly black stains on my bottom teeth(the stains covered 3/4 of each tooth on my lower bottom row)....I tried this product, basically because it was inexpensive and every other product I used failed, so nothing to lose.  Much to my surprise and delight, this product actually removed every bit of the tobacco stain that I could get to on my teeth.  I wish I had taken before/after pictures to document it. Major difference!  As some other reviewers noted, the rubber tips do begin to fall apart as they get wet, but as they disintegrate they still are removing the stains on the teeth. Not a big deal because they do the job and they are inexpensive.   Highly recommend this product for removing tobacco stains!</li>
    <li> this was a waste of a couple of $&#x27;s.  This is literally a Q-tip, with sandpaper on the end...it&#x27;s gritty, and not necessary to use...teeth are bones, by using sandpaper on them, it will only wear away the teeth.  Some peoples teeth are never going to get white, no matter what they try- like me! it sucks, but after trying about 50 products, I have come to that conclusion. and I DO NOT smoke, or drink coffee/wine.  If you go tanning, it will make your teeth look whiter.  This product can damage the condition of your teeth. I would advise not to use.</li>
    <li> The stain eraser is a bit awkward to use.  My lower teeth are crowded so does not get in the tight spaces on the back of my teeth as much as I would prefer.  Works okay on the front of my teeth where I have more control over the eraser.</li>
    <li> This worked for the coffee/tea stains between my bottom front teeth. Perfect for stubborn stains in tight areas. Just be patient and follow package directions.</li>
    <li> You are better off getting sand paper and putting it on your teeth; That is basically what this is.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Completely useless. I used the product in every possible way. Gave it all the time and effort it deserved. I would say that it made a difference, about 5%. And that&#x27;s being generous. Maybe it worked on some customers with easier stains on the tooth surface (reflecting on the great reviews), but it is completely useless for stains between teeth.</li>
    <li> I see from other reviews that it didn&#x27;t necessarily work for everyone... but it does wonders for tobbaco stains! The tip does indeed flake a little during use, but the results to me are well worth it! The first time I used it was about 3 days after I had a dental cleaning... and this removed the stains left behind! I am using it now about once a week to prevent further staining and to remove the yellowing particularily at the point where the teeth meet... It doesn&#x27;t actually get between teeth (unless you have really large gaps) but along those edges it is great. My teeth were visabily whiter after just the first use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on pretty convincing reviews and trying to avoid the costly visit to the dentist for a cleaning for a little while longer. I have some pretty bad staining from drinking coffee, to where people were starting to point it out. I was getting self conscious about it and starting to smile with my mouth closed. I used this (it only took about 5 minutes) and the stains were gone! I didn&#x27;t do all my teeth, just the two front ones where the really bad stains were, but the look of my teeth improved greatly! It&#x27;s not a teeth cleaning, but if you have stains that you need gone and can&#x27;t get to the dentist, buy this!</li>
    <li> The eraser is designed to crumble a bit so that you don&#x27;t scratch the enamel of your teeth by pressing too hard.  Just don&#x27;t use it when the metal tip at the center is showing.  This does work well on coffee/tobacco/red wine stains.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys those vices!</li>
    <li> So I was skeptical of this thing that &amp;#34;erases&amp;#34; tooth stains, but as a coffee drinker, I was starting to get self-conscious of the staining that was beginning to set in. And for how inexpensive the product is, I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deal. This product is a mild abrasive. I did some research and found out that in the long run under normal usage, you will be able to remineralize any minor abrasion caused by the use of the eraser either by natural means or by using a remineralizing mouthwash or toothpaste. Whew, that&#x27;s a relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting to work the last few nights. There&#x27;s two sides, one side for between teeth, and another side better for working on the flat surfaces. I worked on my top two teeth the first night for a few minutes, really getting in the cracks and have been repeating the routine for a few days now, going to different teeth and getting more spots I missed on the teeth I did already. This thing really did erase the staining beginning to form between my teeth and along my gum-line. I suppose you could do everything in one session, but it might take up to 200 strokes (I think I read that somewhere) to get everything off (and could be why one negative reviewer thought it didn&#x27;t work). Breaking the task down really helped me make the task easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it works eventually, now here&#x27;s some other stuff you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any sort of sensory issues with anything rubbing on your teeth, you might not be able to use it, depending on your tolerance level. I personally have this problem, but the abrasive action was not bothersome enough for me to not use the eraser. The texture is not &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; like I thought it would be, it was more &amp;#34;gritty,&amp;#34; but it was a fine enough grit for me to not be bothered by it thankfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as the negative reviewer stated, it does break down a bit and leave some debris on your teeth. This also really didn&#x27;t bother me very much because when I&#x27;m done using the product, I can brush and if I need to, floss to get it out. I do imagine the contents of the eraser will wear out eventually, and be of no use, but I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few days and even though little bits rub off, They still look new, so I&#x27;m sure one would be able to clean their teeth before the whole thing wears down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even with the couple mild negatives, it&#x27;s not enough to remove a star. I liked the immediate results of using this eraser and would recommend this to anyone who would like whiter teeth between dentist visits.</li>
    <li> I expected the eraser to remove my stains, and it does to some degree, but not quite as well as I would have liked.  It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require much pressure.  Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I guess I just don&#x27;t get it.  I do not understand the application of this product.  If you put it in your mouth, it disintegrates into dust like pieces.  I do not  think there is anything practical or appealing about this stain eraser.  This is a fail for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this is even supposed to work but I tried it and it does absolutely nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
    <li> Lots of work. There is no quick fix for stain issues on teeth and with some due diligence and persistence,  this product can help you.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. Came from Japan. Even the directions were Japanese. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Oh ,  oh ,  Staino ! Where  have  you  been ?  Tooth stain removal , without  all of that expensive  waste,and  in between  dental  visits,done well  and  priced ,oh,so right .</li>
    <li> Works well to get stains off, but too fat to get between teeth where brown creeps forward.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase but I still think there&#x27;s a need for a better DIY system.</li>
    <li> This little wonder is compact, light, simple and, most importantly, it does exactly what it says it will do.  (And it shipped fast, which is always nice. :) )</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product. It felt like i was scrubbing my teeth with a nail file without seeing any lightening of stains .</li>
    <li> It was amazing! I tried everything and this worked instantly. It literally changed my life. I can finally smile and have conversations</li>
    <li> This device really works as it removes stains and tartar from your teeth. Couldn&#x27;t believe it was so easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely pointless to buy a huge waste of money! i thought the product was going to be electronic, you have to manually scrub your own teeth what a joke! dont waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is so bad I can&#x27;t believe I fell for it.  I will never buy anything like this again. ever</li>
    <li> OK for the price.  Would have preferred a product that would get in between my teeth. I drink hot tea and it leaves stains between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Works just as described. Took me literally 5 minutes to remove tobacco stains! Love this product! Would recommend for tobacco stains!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to try to remove two brown stains on my front teeth that I got from smoking.  They were dark and visible when I smiled.  I tried putting new toothpaste on my firm toothbrush again after normal brushing just to really scrub at the stains for a few extra minutes each day for the past couple weeks with no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this out and was able to rub off the stains in about two minutes, seriously they came right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not comment on wine or coffee stains, but for tobacco stains it seems to work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a little firmer than a pencil eraser, but not anywhere near as abrasive as some of the negative reviews claim.  Some negative reviews make it sound like a pumice stone on a stick and it is not.  The eraser material does flake off as it works, just like a pencil eraser on paper, and you will need to rinse after using obviously.  I think this product is very effective for spot stains on the surface of teeth, not fixing general yellowing of teeth caused by smoking, a bleaching kit is likely better suited for that.</li>
    <li> This really gets rid of stains especially used with the polishing compounds</li>
    <li> Very good product! I was definitely amazed at how well this product worked. I am very satisfied and recommend this.</li>
    <li> Dis not remove stains.</li>
    <li> The stains I am trying to remove are those at the roots, so getting those off is very difficult.  It works well for the other stains on the teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for removing stuff from your tooth surface.. but DEFINITELY does not whiten. Also, leaves gray stuff on your teeth so brushing /flossing/mouthwash is a MUST after.</li>
    <li> This gadget is great!  I just wish they made one a little more narrow to fit between the teeth a bit better.  The price here is a little high, though, and you can find this much cheaper elsewhere.</li>
    <li> never bought one of these instruments before.  Used with a powdered tooth scrubber and it worked very well.  I would buy again</li>
    <li> didnt work i dont want to write 18 more words, this is why I normally dont review. This is ridiculous</li>
    <li> Great for removing stains between teeth. Works where bleaching strips can&#x27;t reach. It should last for a good long time.</li>
    <li> Was much smaller than I anticipated.  Tips are some type of rough material which, so far, have not removed the stains between my teeth.  You might consider buying a whitening gel instead.  Product did come in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Worked as promised. My son had developed a stain in the middle of his front teeth from smoking. He had gotten hurt and they had to wire his jaw shut for nearly a year and after smoking through a wired jaw for a year he had a considerable stain. This tool got rid of the stain in a couple of uses. Not sure how it works, only that it does.</li>
    <li> This tool does nothing...saw absolutely NO DIFFERENCE!</li>
    <li> Ordered this in hopes of removing brown Chlorhexidine gluconate stains (which haven&#x27;t responded to standard tooth bleaching products) from my teeth.  It&#x27;s like using a tiny pencil eraser, and it did very little to diminish the stains, not on the flat surface of my teeth nor in the crevices between teeth.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> The eraser crumbled while using it, and left pieces of gray on my teeth.  I do not recommend this product.  There was a very small amount of stain removed.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I had two tobacco stains on my front top teeth for years.  Even after  dental visits they were still there.  I long since stopped smoking. However, the ugly stains remained.  I received this product and within 10-15 minutes the stains were gone.  It will remove surface stains.  You may have to erase for 10 minutes or more but wat a difference.  I will continur,e to use this product for in between cleanings and very thankful for getting my smile back.</li>
    <li> it did not work as I expected and it got all gritty.</li>
    <li> Works, you&#x27;ll notice a difference. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of yellow teeth, but top surface stains.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for cleaning stains from the gum line and the spaces between my somewhat crooked teeth. It doesn&#x27;t get stains from the tiny spaces in between teeth but it&#x27;s small enough that just about anything left is too small to be noticeable. Keeping them white is usually a hassle. Just one eraser has helped my teeth stay whiter and cleaner looking for months.</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail, opened it, read what I was suppose to do, and it works!!! I&#x27;m a coffee drinker, and we know it can cause stains....removed them with no problem!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this for the lower&#x27;s primarily behind the teeth.  Good for tough stains like coffee and wine, works out pretty well!</li>
    <li> Such a waste of my time and money!  Not at all what I expected.  I had rather go to dentist than use these!  Bad choice.</li>
    <li> I have no needed to use this product as i have just had my teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to order more because they were only $1.08 each but can&#x27;t find that price anymore.</li>
    <li> So far so good; it seems to work to remove stains well, if not a little slowly.  I only use it a few seconds on what I believe is a stain, and then I let the tooth &amp;#34;rest.&amp;#34;  Saliva can remineralize the tooth finish given proper diet and conditions, so I only gently rub on the stained tooth a little every few days.  The stain has decreased in size, and I&#x27;ve experienced no sensativity or other problems, so I think it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;ll continue until the staino is worn down completely or the stain is gone.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZIN! Removed old coffee satins took a week but my teeeth are WHITE! Will always use this! I ahve 5 family members who are buying this! The only issue I did not like was the cost of shipping. Other tahn that I am a Staino for lifo!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. I have stains at the gum line - on the front of the teeth - easy to get to. This product did not help at all. I was persistent and worked on it for 3 days straight. No difference.</li>
    <li> It does work, but the heads seem to wear down more quickly than I thought they would. But still think it works.</li>
    <li> It was OK, but the tips are not very strong, but it does clean the stains that I had on my teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product and it does absolutely nothing.  I saw no difference on the stains on the back of my teeth.</li>
    <li> It is a cheap product worth not more than couple pennies.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it to anyone. No way.</li>
    <li> Not good to remove stain  for my purpose.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this item would clean the stains from my teeth but it did not work at all.</li>
    <li> My wife had tea stains on her teeth.  This is great stuff anytime and you could skip the dentist for another time.</li>
    <li> This works very well. I 100% recommend it. I used it over 3 days and am amazed with the results.</li>
    <li> UHHH, its okay, but not as results driven as I had imagined.  It can assist in stain removal but it is not the magic answer.  Best to just go to your Dentist and let him do it.  But, at this price, its worth a try for you.  You may have the results you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I used to hate cigarettes but now I&#x27;ve been smoking for about 12yrs and was highly upset that smoking had sacrificed my smile. I am a vain person and have become self conscious about the tar stains on my teeth. Recently I&#x27;ve tried the whitening products which brightened everything except the tar stains. I am a skeptic about everything! I thought the only way to get rid of tar stains was by going to a dentist. This product has made me a believer. It worked perfectly for me, tar stains gone after one use! I Will be recommending this product to every smoker I know.  Extremely happy consumer</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed and quicker than I expected it. Thank you for a prompt delivery and quality product. This took my cheesy looking smile stained by espresso and cigarettes and made me look like a movie star. Ok I was a bit over dramatic but this stuff works great. Even works great on tile and grout. ha ha just kidding! still it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Since I am a smoker and drink a lot of coffee, my front teeth (in between the teeth) in particular tend to stain between dental visits.  There is just nothing else quite like the &amp;#34;crumbly&amp;#34; tips on this stain removal tool to easily access the stained areas and &amp;#34;rub out&amp;#34; these stains.  It is also conveniently packaged to carry with me in purse or luggage.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has this type tooth staining problem.</li>
    <li> This little stain eraser really does work. Although it does not remove all the stains, but definitely helps with reducing the stains.</li>
    <li> For the cost of this product, it worked pretty good and holds up quite well.  I would suggest getting 2-3 of them as I did cause they last a few weeks.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this from other reviews! It does NOT work!!</li>
    <li> good for trying to clean your teeth in your own home</li>
    <li> I was a little leary about buying this product, wondering if something this inexpensive could really work.  But I bought it and I&#x27;m amazed with how well it works!  It erases the stains as advertised.  I would recommend it![[ASIN:B000BF3ZVA STAINO TOOTH STAIN ERSR 1 HNDL Size: 2 TIPS]]</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. I had some dark stains around my gum lines from years of smoking and coffee drinking and this little tool just rubbed them off. It can only clean smooth surfaced though and will not get in-between the teeth. While it doesn&#x27;t replace the hygienist it can give you a quick polish</li>
    <li> Works great for general surface stains, but not as great for removing stains between teeth. Also wish they had a tool with a hinge joint to remove stains from behind the teeth. It was a little hard to get behind the front teeth.</li>
    <li> I had red wine stains on my teeth. This stain eraser took a lot of effort and didn&#x27;t remove the stains completely.</li>
    <li> Shape makes it for use on front of teeth only for the most part. Useless for back of teeth as you cannot get the right angle needed.</li>
    <li> This tool has saved my smile.  I have been a smoker for 15 or more years and have not visited the dentist in at least 13 years due to financial reasons.  My smile was suffering due to very dark brown tobacco stains.  It had gotten to the point where I smile with my mouth closed to avoid the embarrassment.  Bought this tool with little hope of it actually working effectively.  It took about 15-20 minutes of erasing...but 90% of the stains are gone.  The only problem was getting to the stains that are in between my teeth.  The tool does not fit well in between the teeth and those stains will have to be removed by a dentist.  I am very happy with the results.  Very impressed, especially after all the whitening and stain toothpaste I have tried in the past.  This was the best $6 I have ever spent.  Staino-$6, your smile-priceless!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely amazed that for this tiny price this product worked like a charm.  I can&#x27;t believe it so I had to get on to post a review.  I have pretty white teeth to start but had to switch recently from coffee to tea.  The tea really stained one bottom tooth almost black.  I tried whitening strips, bleaching pens, bleaching mouthwash, hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to no avail.  I applied this producet with tooth powder and the stain rubbed right off with minimal effort.  Yes, it is true that it does not get into the cracks between teeth well but it does help.  It does crumble while being used and the tooth turns a little grayish but once you rinse it all washes away and in my case, the tooth is now sparkling and matches the rest.</li>
    <li> This stain remover is the first one I have tried and is good and does exactly what it says it does. It can be a bit tricky getting right in between teeth especially if they are a bit squint but overall it removes the stains. This product is light and easy to use too</li>
    <li> I wish I could yell to the whole world this product is legit and works. I tried hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, listerine. This product was the ONLY thing that removed the brown stains from my teeth and I really wish I could post a before and after picture. Thank you for the product and GODBLESS</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Believe it or not this handy little tool works.  It really does erase stains from your teeth.  I drink a lot of coffee and regularly have some staining on my teeth.  Just rub this on the stains and watch them go away.  I really like this one!</li>
    <li> I only used this once because it simply doesn&#x27;t work. I rubbed it on my teeth for about 15 mins and nothing except for a bunch of grey pieces in my mouth.</li>
    <li> This is pretty cool. It removed these really dark lines I had on the front of my teeth from smoking that I could never get rid of before. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this stain eraser because it has small tips to help get to some of the spots between teeth. I have not had it break on me as some reviews have stated, but I can see how it would if you are not careful when handling it and using it.  It&#x27;s really VERY small and since it ships from Japan it can take a month to get, but it does work.  I use this to augment the stain eraser that comes with the ZJchao 3 in 1 Oral Dental Hygiene LED Professional Cleaning Tools I purchased via Amazon several months ago.  The cleaning tool in this kit is WONDERFUL - sturdy, the angle and the handle &amp; light make it a REALLY great tool for safely removing stains.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work started crumbling</li>
    <li> I take very good care of my teeth and am constantly ticked because the backs of my front teeth (top and bottom) get brown stains from espresso, tea and smoking.  I have veneers upper and lower and was concerned that this might harm them, not to worry, this little eraser is a miracle worker and doesn&#x27;t scratch the tooth in any way!  Will save me a lot of money since I will not have to have my teeth professionally cleaned as often!</li>
    <li> It does do as it claims but... I really don&#x27;t like the eraser stuff in my mouth after use.  I feel like I never get it all out.  But... it does erase it like it says it does, like a Mr. Clean Eraser for your teeth.</li>
    <li> Did not remove any stains, In fact left grey crud between my teeth- at least it was only a 10$ mistake!</li>
    <li> I am ambivalent as to how effective these &#x27;stain erasers&#x27; are. I suppose with regular use, they might make a difference. But they do sort of crumble away with a lot of pressure, and you need to apply a good amount of pressure in order to get to stains between the teeth. They seemed like they were working when I first started using them, but I haven&#x27;t been consistent. If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle, I don&#x27;t think this would be it. But they might help you get some stains out if you are determined.</li>
    <li> THE WORST PRODUCT I EVER BOUGHT</li>
