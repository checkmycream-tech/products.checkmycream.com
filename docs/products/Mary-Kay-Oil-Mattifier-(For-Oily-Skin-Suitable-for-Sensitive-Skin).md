      <li>Great product, keep skin shine free</li>
      <li>It disappears and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly after order and works good.</li>
      <li>I feel that there are probably better products out there that will keep the shine away and cheaper ones that give you more product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many mattifiers.</li>
      <li>Make sure you reord way before running out...</li>
      <li>and I still love it.</li>

      <li>The only downside is that if you put too much your skin will look chalky and dried out...not a good look.  </li>

<li> I will buy it again and refer other people to this product.</li>
<li> For me, my skin stayed matte for a few hours, maybe about 5</li>
<li> After washing my face, I use mattifier like usual, but then blend some in around my hairline to absorb oil that collected over night.</li>
<li> Oil control lasts for approximately 2 hours, wish it lasted longer.</li>
<li> and I desperately needed something to wear under my makeup to help with this.  </li>

    <li> Good Product and great price.  Shipped in a timely manner and would recommend seller.  Will order again sometime soon. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It came on time, and worked nicely!  You only need a little bit, so quite economical!</li>
    <li> After blotting on this product I put on my powdered foundation and my face looks amazing!! Received lots of compliments on my makeup from family and friends. No one knew that I added this product. If you have oily skin, get this mattifier. You&#x27;ll find after awhile you can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly after order and works good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using MK&#x27;s mattifier for about 5 years.  It&#x27;s the perfect solution for controlling shine on my oily forehead and hairline without having to load up on a lot of powder.  I can get a natural look by simply blending in a pea sized drop before I use my SPF moisturizer from Biore.  It disappears and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps if you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair the next day, too, so your hair doesn&#x27;t get as oily.  After washing my face, I use mattifier like usual, but then blend some in around my hairline to absorb oil that collected over night.</li>
    <li> Make sure you reord way before running out...</li>
    <li> My favorite matifier; I will always use it.</li>
    <li> Great product, keep skin shine free</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin like mine !</li>
    <li> This is the only oil mattifier that really works for me without the hassle of dealing with a local rep.</li>
    <li> I use this oil magnifier very regularly. I have very oily skin and it helps control the shine almost all day.  The seller was prompt in sending to me.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used this for years and I still love it. I will buy it again and refer other people to this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for very oily skin. I&#x27;m using for years. Fast delivery. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin all year round but excessively so in the spring and summer months. I stumbled upon oil mattifiers and finally decided on this one. My skin is sensitive so I am careful what I put on it. I&#x27;ve been using this mattifier for about a month with good results. I apply it to my T-zone before applying my makeup and it controls my shine. Not completely, all day, as I have to touch up my face with powder 3-4 times during the day. This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and I&#x27;ve tried many mattifiers. This one is the best. It keeps shine at bay for several hours without over-drying your skin. The vendor delivered it quickly. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My skin is shiny, all the time, even when it is as dry as a bone and I desperately needed something to wear under my makeup to help with this.  You only need a small amount around the T-Zone after applying a moisturizer and before applying makeup. For me, my skin stayed matte for a few hours, maybe about 5 then it did get shiny.  The only downside is that if you put too much your skin will look chalky and dried out...not a good look.  I feel that there are probably better products out there that will keep the shine away and cheaper ones that give you more product.</li>
    <li> Left some kind of film that looks like dry skin anywhere I used it on my face. didn&#x27;t really  keep the oil away for more than a couple hours. will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This mattifier works instantly. It makes your foundation appear flawless. Even if you do start to get oily hours later, just dab your face with kleenex and you&#x27;ll look completely refreshed without using any pressed powder.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works well, but the only down side is the amount you have to use. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel chalky or have any discoloration, it feels light and there is no smell. My skin is very oily and I have to use a lot, so if you&#x27;re like me get several bottles when you first purchase it first like two or three! When I run out I&#x27;m order three next time!</li>
    <li> Oil control lasts for approximately 2 hours, wish it lasted longer. I find I need to use quite a bit of the product to see results.</li>
