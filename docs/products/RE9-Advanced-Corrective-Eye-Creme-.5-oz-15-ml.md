      <li>I like Arbonne products, but this eye cream is only good for moisture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used the face moisturizer for years and thought this would be great for the eye area. Well... Sadly enough.. It was not!&lt;br /&gt; It bothered my eyes so much I had to get my eyes checked. I wear contacts and it really irritated my eyes. Can not wear.</li>
    <li> Again, I love this product, but it will not last long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne for years and I love it. I&#x27;ve tried other product lines like Origins, Mary Kay, and Clinique and none of them measure up. I always go back to Arbonne. This eye cream is just what you&#x27;d expect. It smells great and you really don&#x27;t have to use that much of it for it to work.</li>
    <li> Awesome eye cream - Have been using it for past 6 or 7 years, and absolutely love it.  Have used all the other RE9 Arbonne facial products, but this is my favorite.  Removes puffiness, keeps eyes looking young.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product, use it every day.  I am 47 this year and have NO wrinkles or dark circles around my eyes thanks to Arbonne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this eye cream for four days, but honestly, I could see results after the first use.  My lids seemed sort of puffy, and I&#x27;ve struggled w/ dark circles.  This cream really seems to give me a lift and brightens my entire eye area. I love it!      Sure, it IS pricey, but I can tell you right now, you need less than a pencil eraser-sized dollup to do both eyes. It will last quite some time, even when applying twice/day.</li>
    <li> I got talked into buying this product through the Arbonne pyramid scheme.  I have been using this twice a day for about 2 months now and have seen no difference.  Don&#x27;t waste you money and definitely don&#x27;t buy into this pyramid scheme!!!</li>
    <li> I used the RE9 Advanced Corrective Eye Cream for a long time and loved it.  I lost my job and tried to cut back on unnecessary expenses.  I tried nearly ever drug store eye cream and a few of the less expensive eye creams from Sephora.  None were even close to the magic that RE9 has.  I have the beginnings of loss of firmness and crow&#x27;s feet as well as bags.  This stuff significantly reduces all of those issues.  One of the most moisturizing eye products that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ll never leave them again!</li>
    <li> Great product, helps with puffiness, fine lines and smoothing under the eyes. I have really sensitive eyes and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found in a while that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and still does the job at perfecting and firming. I&#x27;ve been using for 6 months now and I started seeing a difference in radiance and firmness under the eyes after 1 week.</li>
    <li> This product is no different from any other eye creme &amp; expensive.  Next time I will go by the other reviews &amp; save my money.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product in years past from a friend who sold Arbonne and loved it. However, it seems as if the product has changed.  I did not see any noticeable difference in dark spots or puffiness under my eyes.  Also, it used to have a faint soothing spa smell and no longer does.  It is completely different from what I had before.  I would not spend the money again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye creme for over 2 years and I love it.  It is one of my favorite Arbonne products.  I think it helps with dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles all in one.  I apply morning and night.  The newer bottles have some sort of air pump funtion, which is great, because you only need a tiny, tiny bit.  The only problem is that you can&#x27;t tell how much is left in the bottle.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for 5 months and I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s getting close to running out.</li>
    <li> The product itself is good.  Overall it has reduced puffiness and makes the area smoother.  It is concentrated therefore only a small amount is needed for application.</li>
    <li> I WAS SO IMPRESSED THAT AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF ORDERING, MY PACKAGE ARRIVED.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW FAST  I RECEIVED MY PRODUCTS.  WHAT A WONDERFUL SELLER \\&quot;INSPIRED BY MY GIRLS\\&quot; IS... THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reviewing several items on Amazon and comparing their rating and price - and this one was the higher rated product and more affordable. At first I thought this product worked and I enjoy the citrus smell, but over the last month and a half I haven&#x27;t seen too much change in my dark circles. Disappointed in this product, I had hoped it would do more.</li>
    <li> My undereyes got really really red and SWOLLEN the next morning after I used it..I&#x27;ve never had any issues with any products before. This was actually the first time that I had an unusual reaction from using an eye cream. I would stay away from it expecially if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used the RE9Advanced Corrective Eye Creme for quite a while and really like it. Everytime I run out and have to wait, my eyes show it!! My experience with this order was great and I received it quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye creme for about 2 years....This is the first eye cream that I&#x27;ve tried that worked AND didn&#x27;t cause burning eventually in my eyes. I love this product, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.I have tried numerous eye creams, but this was my answer.</li>
    <li> I tend to react to just about everything with skin irritation in my eye area, so I was very pleasantly surprised to experience no bad reactions to this crème! Like others have said, it makes a noticeable difference in a matter of days. It has helped lessen puffiness and firm up the fine lines.</li>
    <li> The area around our eyes needs special care and I have found that this product (which lasts a long time) is a great way to take care of that area.  Personally, I have tried some other ARBONNE skin care products and found that I was one of the VERY FEW people who had an allergic reaction, but this product works well for me.</li>
    <li> I find this product is very moisturizing, a little goes a long way. It works well under makeup. After using it under my eyes for a while, I started getting excessively puffy. My skin was going through a sensitive fussy time though so I backed off using it and it&#x27;s fine. However, the REAL gem for me was when I tried it on my chest during the break from my eyes. I have some very fine lines there and this eliminated them. Now I use it almost exclusively on my chest to keep the lines away and hoping it will fade some freckles. Arbonne should market it for the chest!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and absolutely love it&#x27;s skin renewal benefit!  It works wonders and is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the ONLY eye cream I have ever used and didn&#x27;t have a reaction.  It arrived promptly and faster than the company of \\&quot;Arbonne\\&quot; sends it to you.  I love this eye cream-try it!!!</li>
    <li> I was in an accident a few years ago and my eyelids were all stretched out from severe bruising. My lower eyelids ended up so permanently wrinkled that it made me look and feel terrible.  This product makes those lines disappear in a minute or two and the effect lasts all day.  What a morale boost!  This is one of my favorite Arbonne products and I am grateful that I can buy it here.</li>
    <li> I used to subscribe to Arbonne in order to purchase their products. I let that expire and am so happy Amazon carries their products. This eye cream is pricey, but I love the smell and it helps with my smile lines.</li>
    <li> Great product...need to have sales or lower prices</li>
    <li> Best product for eye care</li>
    <li> After battling painful dry, peeling skin around my eyes, I landed on Arbonne&#x27;s solution.  Have used for several years, eye tissue has healed, rehydrated and is near wrinkle-free.  It works!</li>
    <li> Alright, so as I&#x27;m aging, I&#x27;m really starting to see the fine (and not so fine) lines creep in - especially around my eyes.  And, although I really want a miracle product, I guess just trying to minimize the progression will have to do.  This eye creme by Arbonne is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried, and does help.  I use it in conjunction with their lightening creme to soften the effects that this aging process is creating. This creme goes on nicely and can easily be worn under make-up without splotching up.  I recommend this and the other RE9 products - which I discovered during a nice facial at a local spa.</li>
    <li> Favorite eye cream for bags.</li>
    <li> I have lost most of my eyelashes and the only change was adding this eye cream to my facial care.</li>
    <li> This was in an Arbonne RE9 bottle, however it is not the RE9 eye cream. I have been using this cream for 2 years and it is an off white, very thin lotion that absorbs easily into the skin. The stuff that was on the bottle was white and thick and did not absorb easily, and when I would wake up in the morning after using it my eyes were burning from whatever that stuff is getting into my eyes. This sale was a scam.</li>
    <li> My skin breaks out all the time and is super sensitive. My sister recommended this and it feels amazing. I don&#x27;t know if it is, but it really really feels like it&#x27;s working. Definitely keeping my under-eyes hydrated!</li>
    <li> I like ke using this product!  Glad to be able to purchase on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Have used for years ... seems like the container is getting smaller and the price is getting higher ... but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase fast shipping and great product thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it only last maybe a couple of weeks. When I opened the bottle it wasn&#x27;t even filled but MAYBE an 1/8 of the way down. There wasn&#x27;t even a pump down to the bottom. Don&#x27;t waste your money with these people, they rip you off with very little cream in the container!! There was definitely NOT the amount stated on the bottle!</li>
    <li> I used this product every day until it was gone!  I saw absolutely no results!  For the price and the small size try a different product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week and so far so good. Not too greasy and a little dab will do you. Have already seen a difference in puffiness but too soon for wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
    <li> Excellent for getting rid of the dark circles</li>
    <li> The ease of use is positive and twice a day is most effective.&lt;br /&gt;Small lines have disappeared, dark circles have improved.</li>
    <li> Great product and completely non allergic.  A bit on the pricey side but very effective in controlling wrinkles around eyes.  Biggest thing is non-allergic.</li>
    <li> Hello fellow wanting-to-look-younger chicks.  I have been using eye creme since my early 20&#x27;s, and I am now somewhere over 39 ;)    Within those 20 years, I have tried many many products.  Simply put, this is the best eye creme that I have ever used.  I have been using this product for 5 years now, and I still love it.  It&#x27;s lightweight, goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, instantly makes the skin around your eyes look better, and as other reviewers have said, you only need a small amount of product.  I can still remember the first time I ever used it...applied it when I woke up, then applied my makeup about an hour later.  I could not believe how smooth my under eye concealer went on!  One tip that I have found...if you plan to apply your makeup later in the day, I would apply another very small amount under your eyes a few minutes before putting on your makeup.  This makes it go on much smoother.  Yes, it is more expensive than eye cremes that you could purchase at your local store, however it lasts a looooooooong time and is much LESS expensive than some eye cremes sold in department stores.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife who bought one initially from an Arbonne distributor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little cheaper to get it from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note that the bottle from the Arbonne distributor was almost twice as big as the one from amazon even though the actual content was the same amount.... .5 fl oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I have been using RE9 AdvancedCorrective Eye Creme for quite a long time and I like it. I will order more next time.</li>
    <li> I found this for my wife who had been using the product already but she had been paying much more from a personal sales person. Delivered quickly, great packaging, and big $$ savings.</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic.  I have incredibly dry skin and the skin under my eyes is so crepey that when it gets dry, it will actually tear.  This cream is so incredibly hydrating that as long as I&#x27;m using it, I have no problems.  It is pricey and while I was pleased with it, I tried several other less expensive products and none of them gave me the results I needed.  I will definitely be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne Products..</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for for a good price</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a couple years..wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t believe it was genuine product, the item didn&#x27;t come sealed so I coulda been anything in this bottle. It slightly burned when I applied. Far too sketchy. Get product from actual website.</li>
    <li> I have used all of the RE9 products and I love the product.  I will always use this product for life.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the only one I will use. It is soothing and leaves my skin very soft and supple. Probably because of it I have no eye wrinkles at all at age 51.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle eye cream that feels good and smells good. It does not burn or tingle like many eye creams I have tried, and it also does not give me an allergic reaction (MANY eye cream products do). I have the pump bottle, which is easy to use and dispenses a small amount. I suspect one bottle is enough for at least 6 months of twice daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have not \\&quot;noticed\\&quot; a change, but I&#x27;m religious about my skin care routine and know the importance of using an eye cream. Arbonne makes good products, but I&#x27;m looking for something a little more amazing. That being said, I haven&#x27;t yet come across an eye cream that&#x27;s in this price range, does everything this product does, and is universally *loved* by lots of women.</li>
    <li> BEST EYE CREME.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE HIGHLY SENSITIVE SKIN &amp; THIS DOES NOT BOTHER ME AT ALL PLUS MAKES MY SKIN LOOK GREAT</li>
    <li> This eye cream keeps my under eye skin supple and smooth.  However I NEVER received the product.  Could you resend overnight?  Please</li>
    <li> I am definitely going to be a regular with this seller.  Just ordered 2 more products. I absolutely love this eye cream more than any other I have ever ever used.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years.  When I try other eye creams I seem to wrinkle more - so I return to RE9 Advaced Corrective Eye Creme.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact I think this product is overpriced,  it works well.  A little goes a long way.  I use it twice day and it last about 3 months.</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne products and have been using them for a few years.  I am 47 years old and people can&#x27;t believe it because my skin looks so young.  I use the entire line and even using it every day, this product will last at least 6 months.</li>
    <li> Maybe the women who rave about this product don&#x27;t truly have wrinkles, but I do; in my early 40&#x27;s with fair skin that I&#x27;ve unfortunately neglected, especially since having kids 7 years ago. I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully, at least once a day and sometimes twice, for 2 months and have seen no noticeable improvement at all. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> This product is great, works well, and you can see a difference within 48 hours of using it. It is not for all skin types though, but Arbonne has many other products for different skin types. So far have not met anyone who does not like this one though.</li>
    <li> I like Arbonne products, but this eye cream is only good for moisture. Not working for dark circles and according to cosmeticcop.com ladies don&#x27;t need an eye cream for moisture.  Any good cream that works on the face without serums/retinol will work for the eyes.  Nice, but not a necessary purchase.  Paula&#x27;s choice creams are working for me as face and eye creams and are much less expensive than Arbonne.</li>
    <li> I am a redhead with very sensitive skin around my eyes. I have no reactions to this product plus the puffiness and darkness under my eyes no longer exist.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best eye cream ever</li>
    <li> It is not quite clear if this is really a natural product. Taking all the explanations it seems obvious that there are chemical Things in it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! You have to pump product to get the desired amount. Always keep the cap on after using. I use a small amount in morning under makeup, not too near eyes or lashes, or on a clean natural face. Night time I use more for renewal during sleep. I recommend for all woman and men, a must have. After a short time of using you will be convinced.</li>
    <li> Love it my eyes look great</li>
    <li> This is a great product but Jojo&#x27;s Top Shelf screwed me this time I had bought this product 2 years ago for about 40.00 and received 30ml a nice size bottle, this time the description did not mention that for 60.00 I would only receive 5ml.  I mean a teeny tiny bottle, if there was a way I could return it I would who has 60.00 for a 4 inch high bottle or cream I sure don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne products.  Been using them for years.  I do have one complaint.  Every time I order the product, it seems to come in a smaller packaging even though it is supposed to be the same size.  And then of course the price is more.</li>
    <li> When one of my friends became an Arbonne representative and invited me to one of her Arbonne parties, this is one of the products I ended up buying--so definitely an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creme comes out of a pump, which works well and lets you get a tiny amount, all you really need. The creme itself is white with a slight yellowish tint and has a fresh, almost citrusy smell. And that&#x27;s about where the good points of this creme end for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turning 30 next year, I don&#x27;t have major problems with wrinkles, but I did have some issues with dark circles and some occasional puffiness under my eyes. I used this for a couple of months. It did nothing for my dark circles or puffiness. What it did do is moisturize under and around my eyes to the point of greasiness and then spread onto my cheeks. And this stuff BURNS going on for at least 10 minutes, and although you should always be careful with products getting into your eyes, this is definitely one of the worse ones for me if that happens (like accidentally rubbing my eye and forgetting I had this stuff on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I could handle some burning and greasiness if this product delivered results (beauty is pain!), but unfortunately for me, it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m glad most of the other reviewers found success with this creme, though, even if I didn&#x27;t. If you have the chance to grab some samples from an Arbonne rep, I would recommend that instead of buying the full size without trying it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin profile: late 20s, fair skin, combination/oily, with occasional breakouts. Maybe this works better for dry skin?

For what it&#x27;s worth, one of the other products I got from the Arbonne party, the [[ASIN:B00476PLQ6 Arbonne FC5 Deep Cleansing Mask]], did a good job cleaning pores and leaving my face feeling clean--I just ended up liking the Lush Mask of Magnaminty better.

    <li> The only eye creme that works for me! I am highly allergic to other products (you name it!). Will never be without!</li>
    <li> A light and non-greasy, gentle moisturizer. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it removed a brown spot on the side of my face. I assumed it was a beauty mark and I hated it so I was advised at an Arbonne party by the rep that it would help my dark, puffy circles under my eyes and to try it on that spot. Still have puffy eyes but quarter size brown spot is gone! received product in two days. hope it works on new (age) spots on my face. AAA+++</li>
    <li> Made a difference in the puffiness around the eyes and moisturizes without a greasy or oily look. jd</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  I have tried many eye creams over the years on my now &#x27;mature&amp;#34; eyes.  For several years now, I have been using the RE9.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but a small amount of the cream goes a long way, so one bottle lasts quite awhile. This product is absolutely worth every penny spent.  After years of trying to find the one eye cream for me, this is the winner!</li>
    <li> I received this production expired</li>
    <li> Maybe I was wanting miracles but after 2 bottles, I don&#x27;t feel or see much difference</li>
    <li> Love this product, works great and the price is right.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I have used it before and then switched to something else.  I switched back because this eye creme softens lines around the eyes and between the eyes on the bridge of the nose.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Just a little bit is needed. This works really well on me. Helps with the fine lines, -- Crows Feet--- Don&#x27;t have them too bad but I know they are there. This stuff helps to fade the look of them. I use it in the morning and again before bedtime. doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs in quickly. works fine under make-up as well.</li>
    <li> The eye creme goes on smoothly and only a minimum amount is needed.  Notice the under eye wrinkles and especially the bags are diminishing.  Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and always come back to it.  Wonderful ingredients.</li>
