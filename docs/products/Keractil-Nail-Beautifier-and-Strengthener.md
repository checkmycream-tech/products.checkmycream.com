      <li>Am I glad I did.</li>
      <li>but glad I tried it.</li>

      <li>I have not had any adverse effects from using it; it is safe and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that it is working so quickly.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many things to cure fungus and this one is the first one that gives me hope!  </li>
      <li>but I have already noticed a huge difference.</li>
      <li>It did not work like I would have had liked I did use it till it was gone and did not see much over all improvement.</li>
      <li>It is important to use it each day.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy &amp; clean to apply.  </li>
      <li>I think it is well worth your while to purchase this product if you have tried many over the counter products and nothing has worked.  </li>

      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>And keep in mind that your nail may grow out darker than the original but be fungus free.</li>
      <li>Treatment - SAFE, SUPER EFFECTIVE - Complete Cure</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the product, and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>It takes a while, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for about a week and a half now with very good results.</li>
      <li>My nails look healthy and are growing out quite fast.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about your products-</li>
      <li>After several more months, it will be even better.  </li>
      <li>However, improvement is noticeable quickly.  </li>
      <li>No smell &amp; dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was prescribed with an oral anti fungal but didn&#x27;t do it because I got pregnant.</li>
      <li>Also I do get frequent peticures to make sure the nail is really clean.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be better to live with the nail fungus.  </li>
      <li>My big toe is looking so much better!  </li>
      <li>I have tried numerous over-the-counter products to treat my LONG TERM nail fungus issue, but I have NEVER had better results since I purchased Keractil!!!</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that the big toe nail now looks like</li>
      <li>and I will be buying it again not saying it works for every condition but its worth a try</li>
      <li>I still have 2 nails that are not fully cured, but am SO CLOSE to being able to wear cute sandals this summer and look forward to FINALLY having strong, pretty toenails at last.</li>
      <li>There is no magic bullet for the fungus, but after using this in conjunction with the Tea Tree Ultimates soap and foot soak, I have seen a great improvement.  </li>
      <li>This is okay and about as good as anything else for Nail Fungus which in itself is very hard to treat.</li>
      <li>It is odorless, and dries clear which makes it easy to use right before bed and in the morning.</li>
      <li>Finally, my affected nails look great and looking forward to wearing sandals next year.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on medication for my nails now and a few more started to get healthy because of it but</li>
      <li>I have tried all kinds of treatment and with most, if you miss even one dose/treatment the fungus grows back on the nail (for toenails).  </li>
      <li>I have been using Keractil for several months now and it has helped my nails look much better.  </li>
      <li>After reading the reviews, I gave this a shot and think it has really helped!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have had it over 2 months and (at first) it started to show signs of clearing, but it did not continue.</li>
      <li>I got discouraged with the first  fungal nail treatment that I used before.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was not working, but soon I did see an improvement in my nails.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, but this one actually seems to help.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different products for toenail fungus without any results that is noticeable.</li>
      <li>At first, it seemed to be doing its job.</li>
      <li>Tried many different nail fungus treatments over the years.  </li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re on a super budget I would highly recommend going to the doc.</li>
      <li>I may try one more tube, bringing my total to $60, but it would just be out of pure hope of something working.</li>
      <li>The only one product, without prescription and no nasty side effects that shows real results.</li>
      <li>You may not need to do this if you are able to keep your feet dry in shoes.</li>
      <li>so far product is as described, no orders and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to do much after a couple weeks, but that&#x27;s not enough time to accurately assess it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
      <li>Some nails are responding very well to it</li>
      <li>I really have no idea how I got it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used up 2 tubes of Keractil, meeting or exceeding the directions, and I am not seeing much improvement.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Product as described and fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t give much of an opinion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It did not work like I would have had liked I did use it till it was gone and did not see much over all improvement.</li>
    <li> My doctor said I would have to have the nail removed. Not wanting to do that, I decided to take a chance on Keractil. Am I glad I did. Because the nail grows slow, it takes a while to se results.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product I have tried that has helped my nail grow out clear.  It helps to file the nail down so it&#x27;s not thick. It takes a while, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on one of his toe nails and he has not seen any results from this product. He will try it longer and maybe will see if there is any change???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used up 2 tubes of Keractil, meeting or exceeding the directions, and I am not seeing much improvement. It&#x27;s hard to say if there is any difference, but if there is any it is minimal. I have thick, discolored nails with keratin debris underneath. The debris underneath on my smaller nails causes them to not lay right against the skin, so I am able to trim it all the way down, and I can apply the product directly to the skin and to the nail as it grows back in. I am still having the same issues with the nails. I may try one more tube, bringing my total to $60, but it would just be out of pure hope of something working.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of treatment and with most, if you miss even one dose/treatment the fungus grows back on the nail (for toenails).  I must wear thick stockings year round and closed toe shoes which also makes it difficult to rid of the fungus.  I decided to try this product and see if it works,and actually thought I&#x27;d be disappointed or that it would be another new product that does not work.  I had very low expectations, but I have been surprised.  So far I can say that it works.  Its been two months and half of the fungus infected nail has grown out.  It does take at least two weeks to see the uninfected nail growing out.  And keep in mind that your nail may grow out darker than the original but be fungus free. I do continue to give myself weekly pedicures and a weekly foot soak in half water and half apple cider vinegar.  This aids in killing the fungus on my feet that could reinfect the nails. You may not need to do this if you are able to keep your feet dry in shoes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 6 months and I&#x27;m yet to see the smallest result. Waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> I have been fighting nail fungus on a large toe nail for several years now.  Seems like I&#x27;ve tried everything with marginal success only to have it continue to be a problem.  I&#x27;ve used this product now for a month &amp; it has put a halt to the progressive fungus growth.  I am hoping to see the nail completely grown out &amp; clear in another month or two.  I also have had horrible splitting &amp; peeling fingernails &amp; wondered if that could be attributed to any fungus.  I have used this product in conjunction with Nail-Tek II for a month now on my fingernails and my nails have never looked so good &amp; been so strong.  I am ordering 2 more tubes, as I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this stuff again! It&#x27;s easy &amp; clean to apply.  No smell &amp; dries quickly.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> My big toe is looking so much better!  I have tried so many things to cure fungus and this one is the first one that gives me hope!  I think it is well worth your while to purchase this product if you have tried many over the counter products and nothing has worked.  I definitely see improvement!</li>
    <li> This did not work.  There is no active ingredient.  If you want to get rid of toe fungus, go to a doctor and get a prescription.</li>
    <li> Tried many different nail fungus treatments over the years.  Had the best and quickest results with Keractil.  Finally, my affected nails look great and looking forward to wearing sandals next year.  I have to say this was the cheapest and safest way to get rid of my nail fungus.  My Dr. gave me a prescription.  Whoa, that was the worse.  Gave me headaches and messed up my day.  I thought it would be better to live with the nail fungus.  Then I bought Keractil.  Good-bye nail fungus.  If  you buy this, I hope you have the same response.  I have learned that not everything works for everyone.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I was misled by the product descriptions.  I bought 2 tubes and have been using them for 4 months strictly following the instructions on the package but there is no effect at all. My nail fungus remains as it is.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results I am getting with the Keractil. Not only is it removing the fungus starting on my big toe, it is making all my fingernails so pretty! And the polyactil is excellent also. It is curing a burn I was having problems with for a while! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about your products- and I especially like the fact that there are no side effects.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a few weeks it did nothing for me . Maybe it will work for someone else.</li>
    <li> Went through several tubes along with filing the nails and it simply did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;In the long run it is wasted money.</li>
    <li> I have had toenail fungus problems on my right foot for the past decade. My first attempt with Lamasil cleared up all the nails except for the one on my big toe. The second attempt again failed to cure the fungus problem on that toe. Every now and then, I try a new product hoping that it might permanently eliminate this problem. Keractil was definitely not the solution. In fact, over the past month I have been using Keractil and noticed absolutely no improvement. If you have have had a similar experience with this product (or with others) and want a cheap, temporary solution, I recommend that you apply Vicks VapoRub topical ointment [[ASIN:B003CP15G8 Vicks VapoRub Topical Cough Suppressant Ointment, 50-gram Boxes (Pack of 3)]] to your infected nails twice a day. For me, the results come very quickly - the white, flaky deposits all but disappear and the nails become thinner and nearly clear. From a standing view, the nails look perfect. Be warned however that this is merely an aesthetic solution that lasts only as long as you continue to apply the VapoRub. For me, it is the best solution until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> Received this product expeditiously . . . the application process is easier than other products I have used . . . too soon to report on its&#x27; effectiveness.</li>
    <li> It is a bit early for me to review this product, as I think I need a longer trial with it. However, I am tired of getting emails asking me to review it, so I will give my results so far. It does at least appear to be working the part of the infected nails which has grown in since I started using this looks like it is coming in healthy. This is far more than I can say for any other anti nail fungus product I have used, as most did nothing whatsoever, regardless of their claims,  and were a pure waste of money. I will edit this review later, when I have been using the product longer, with an updated description of the results.</li>
    <li> The only one product, without prescription and no nasty side effects that shows real results. Everything else I tried before did not work.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a little more expensive, but well worth it !!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not fast, but after a month of application there appears to be a degree of change in the color and appearance of my infected nails.</li>
    <li> Prior to using this product, the nail on my big toe was thick and dark. 6 weeks later, they are not as dark and no longer thick. I will continue to use this until the nail fully grows out.   **I don&#x27;t always apply this twice a day as instructed, but I have applied it everyday for the 6 weeks.   I will update this review in about a month.</li>
    <li> Unsuccessfully battling nail fungus for 15 years.  Including visits to Dr. and removal of toenails.  This product works!  Be patient, as clear nails will require several months.  However, improvement is noticeable quickly.  Odorless, painless and remarkable.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> After giving this product 3 months, it did not work for me. At first, it seemed to be doing its job. However, after 2 months, I could see the fungus on my toenail at the cuticle starting to grow again, and I kept on with the treatment. I&#x27;m not going to say it is a bad product, mostly because at the beginning, my toenail was getting a different look. I was impressed with how fast the product was working, but it did not stop my fungus from growing. I ended up visiting the doctor.</li>
    <li> This is okay and about as good as anything else for Nail Fungus which in itself is very hard to treat.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous over-the-counter products to treat my LONG TERM nail fungus issue, but I have NEVER had better results since I purchased Keractil!!! I still have 2 nails that are not fully cured, but am SO CLOSE to being able to wear cute sandals this summer and look forward to FINALLY having strong, pretty toenails at last. I use the product morning and night and make sure I always have plenty of Keractil on hand. As soon as my nails are clear, I will use it as prevention against any further outbreaks, and am confident that I have \\&quot;nailed\\&quot; this problem.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for three weeks so I can only rate it as a 3.  I will return and update at a later time.</li>
    <li> This is quite helpful for peristent nail fungus issuses and prevents you from having to go to a foot doctor.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002A6H7V2 Keractil - Nail Fungus Treatment - SAFE, SUPER EFFECTIVE - Complete Cure; Prevents Fungus Return - No Side Effects - Beautifies &amp; Strengthens Nails]]This products totally effective, unlike many others we have tried. A must have for any with nail problems!</li>
    <li> I have been battling foot (skin) &amp; toenail fungus for decades.  Finally, I found topical Lamasil generic (got 1 oz equate at Walmart for less than $7 for 1 ounce) for the skin (will NOT work on the nails) and THIS product for nails.  After filing my nails down, I noticed improvement in less than a week.  Toenails take long to grow (3 to 12 months) but after 3 months and several tubes of Keractil I noticed about 85% improvement so far.  After several more months, it will be even better.  Oral meds for nail fungus are very dangerous so this topical is safe.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Keractil is making a difference.  Since 2005, I&#x27;ve been trying everything the medical community had to offer as well as several over the counter treatments, including Lamisil from the dermatologist and laser treatment from the podiatrist.  None of which as made a difference except in my pocket book.  Keractil was one treatment in a long line of treatments, so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hope.  After 3 months of applying two times a day, this product has made a big difference.  I have reordered and hope to see complete recovery.</li>
    <li> With constant use it will clear away fungus. Use as directed and you will notice the difference. It does work.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I&#x27;ve been having a terrible nail fungus on my big toe nail for the past 3 years. I got discouraged with the first  fungal nail treatment that I used before. I decided to just just get my nail removed but then it came back. I was prescribed with an oral anti fungal but didn&#x27;t do it because I got pregnant. It got worst to the point that it lifted the nailbed and it&#x27;s very painful even if you just put a little pressure on the nail. So I made a research and found this one. The first few days, I can really actually see my nails getting healthier. My husband noticed it too and I am so happy with the result. It may take a while for it to be completely healed but it gives me hope. I can&#x27;t wait to wear flip flops this summer again.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my gf her toenails had some type of black fungus on it and due to no medical insurance she just keeps them covered instead of seeking medical treatment but not anymore now she be like baby looka my feet lol they clearing up and I will be buying it again not saying it works for every condition but its worth a try</li>
    <li> Took a couple of months and it is all cleared up. Couldn&#x27;t be more please with the product. Was skeptical at first but glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 months and have seen no difference in my two nails that have fungus.  I was really disappointed since there were some positive reviews and others that have had success with it.</li>
    <li> I have had toenail fungus for several years. I have tried everything short of the toxic meds that may cause harm to your liver. I have been using Keractil now for several months and three nails are completely clear and the other seven are in hot pursuit of clearing up. This stuff really works. My nails were very bad and extremely thick. I am thrilled and so pleased that this product is safe to use. I put the product on after my morning shower and then again at bedtime. Hurray!! I recommend Keractil wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> I had nail fungus on all 5 of my left fingers. I really have no idea how I got it. I have tried Fungicure and all the other so called cures and creams. I really did not want to go to the doctor and have all those blood tests. I did research and saw Keractil and decided to try it. It really works. I used it twice a day for about 7 weeks. Now I use it once per day. My pinky finger is already cleared. Two other fingers are ALMOST cleared. The last two fingers are\\&quot;getting there.\\&quot;  When all 5 fingers are completely clear, I am getting a manicure.</li>
    <li> I had 1/4 of my toe nail affected by fungus. After using this product for 6 months my whole nail get affected and became thick and deformed.</li>
    <li> Eight years ago, I received a pedicure in which my two large toe nails were left with fungi. I was reluctant to go to a doctor in fear that the nail would painfully removed and other OTC treatments have not improved the situation. I have only used this product for a month but I have already noticed a huge difference. The nail surface is totally flat, rather than bumpy like before, and I see my cuticles! Awesome product :)</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple weeks or more and I noticed that my nails are nice and soft and can be more easily trimmed to get rid of the bad stuff.  Also my toes nails are becoming straight again and not growing out in odd shapes.  This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> It appears that it may work over 9-12 months time.  In three months, there was some minor improvement of nail conditions.  Liked the thin tube opening that can allow product to be applied under nails.</li>
    <li> This product hasn&#x27;t worked yet. I have had it over 2 months and (at first) it started to show signs of clearing, but it did not continue.</li>
    <li> I too have the one big toenail problem (and one small toe also) that I have been living with and trying to cover up with nailpolish when it is warm out. I began applying this product on 12/8/12 morning and night, everyday (never missing a day) on the affected nails. I can honestly say that the big toe nail now looks like the other one - FINALLY! Just about two weeks ago I decided to begin to apply it once a day, in the evenings, instead. I wanted to test it out to see if my nails will revert back to how they were. So far so good. I am ordering a second tube because I want to make sure ALL the fungus is cured and gone before stopping this treatment, even if my nails look good. I decided to do this over the winter because I don&#x27;t wear nailpolish on my toes and it is the best time to prepare for the upcoming warm weather.</li>
    <li> I have battled toe nail fungus for decades, in two toes. Tried everything. Nothing worked--even the oral prescription! Keractil takes a long time (the nail has to grow out, very slowly). But, it definitely works! It is amazing! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I first bought this product because of the fact its completely harmless to you and secondly because of the reviews. I have tried it and was skeptical of course because I&#x27;ve had to suffer ugly toenails for years. To my surprise it worked (only on a few nails). I don&#x27;t care if it only worked on a few nails, the fact is it still worked on those nails and its stayed healthy since I stopped using it. I&#x27;m on medication for my nails now and a few more started to get healthy because of it but the last two on both my feet only showed slight improvement. I&#x27;m thinking of using this stuff on top of my medication to help boost the improvements. Maybe someday I wont have to hide my feet anymore.</li>
    <li> I have struggled for years with toenail fungus, and have tried just about everything.  After reading the reviews, I gave this a shot and think it has really helped!  There is no magic bullet for the fungus, but after using this in conjunction with the Tea Tree Ultimates soap and foot soak, I have seen a great improvement.  It is odorless, and dries clear which makes it easy to use right before bed and in the morning.</li>
    <li> Always a sceptic...until I started using this product and saw results after only a few days of use!  I saw the blackness of the nail start to disappear and get smaller after I used the product twice a day for three days!  I am seeing the base of the nail looking much better too!  I can&#x27;t wait to see my new toenails after a few months!  Sandals....here I come!!</li>
    <li> This POS either not working at all, or working so slowly, you will die faster than the fungus. Don&#x27;t waist your money on that. There are better products out there. Pur nail for example.</li>
    <li> Product as described and fast shipping.  Still trying out product to see how well the product works. so far product is as described, no orders and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Living with a nail fungus after an infection on my hand the last four years really bothered me. Other than prescriptions where I would have to get blood work on a regular basis I really didn&#x27;t think there was anything on the market that would help until now. I&#x27;ve seen great improvement with Keractil and I don&#x27;t have to worry about liver damage.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about three weeks ago and I am already seeing results with my finger nails.  I have a fungus on a couple of nails, but using this product only once per day (and my nails are polished nails), I am seeing the fungus going away. My nails look healthy and are growing out quite fast.  I&#x27;m glad that it is working so quickly. I will continue using it until the affected nails are back to normal.  I have not had any adverse effects from using it; it is safe and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> its been working but like it tells you in the instructions it takes time i just purchase my second tube...i highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> You got to have patients with this product it works with time. I saw a difference in about a month of using this product.</li>
    <li> I recieved my item quicker than I thought. Thanks for the on the time product. Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be blessed&lt;br /&gt;Doree Boyd</li>
    <li> three years ago i had a pedicure and a few weeks later my big toe discolered and eventually i figured i have a toe fungus, i went to the pharmacy used the most expensive stuff off the shelf didnt work, i went to three foot doctors, they prescribed two different items which didnt work, and the other doctor wasnt concerened i also asked can you remove the toe nail, he said he could but that didnt mean the fungus woulndt grow back. i cant believe the total unconcern these foot doctors had.. i was reading other reviews, thought ok ill try it, so far ive used it for three mths, total change, its not black and really thick anymore. i keep trimming the toe nail and i use a qtip to spread this stuff on my toe around the edges and i jam it under the nail, three mths ago i could jam it almost to the base of the toe nail, know its half way.  Im hoping it completly works, ive gotten pedicures for over twenty years and to have this happen, i hate it. but now i can almost hide it where you cant tell, so today i purchased another tube. you will notice a difference with this, ive tried five other types no improvement at all. good luck</li>
    <li> I started getting fungus in my fingernails about a year and a half ago.  I have been using Keractil for several months now and it has helped my nails look much better.  Although the fungus is not gone yet....It seems to help keep it in check and it soothes the minor discomfort that comes with nail fungus.  If my nails ever get back to normal...I will still continue to use Keractil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I&#x27;ve used other highly recommended and very expensive products and not seen the same results and not nearly as fast. I also love that it is labeled as a nail conditioner so that my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t know that I have a fungus, ick!</li>
    <li> Used for a couple of weeks but had to stop because this product caused gastro-intestinal problems and diarrhea every day. My nails started clearing up but it was not worth the cost. Use at your own peril.</li>
    <li> I got Keractil in June, 2013 and have used it for about two and a half months.  Some nails are responding very well to it but others are not much better, if any.  I think maybe it will eventually fix them all.  It takes a long time for nails to grow.</li>
    <li> Almost all of my nail peeled off in early December of last year and I&#x27;ve been using Keractil since then, so a little over 2 months now. I apply once a day and my nail has almost grown back to the normal length. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> I have been useing this product for a while now at it seems to be working well. I will continune to use for another six months.</li>
    <li> After using the product for 6 months I thought my condition would be a bit better.  Not only was there no improvement but I&#x27;m convinced that it actually infected one of my non-infected toenails!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time to help keep my finger under control.  It is important to use it each day.  It does the job, if you use it faithfully.</li>
    <li> There was no improvement by using this product.  It did not soften the toenails or do anything to help with the fungus.  Used this&lt;br /&gt;product twice a day for months.  My advice is not to buy this product if you think it will remove any toenail fungus.  It just not&lt;br /&gt;work.  Money wasted.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I finally found something that worked!!  This didn&#x27;t smell bad like others I had tried.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Six months of religious daily application: no results. Only one nail, my right small toenail, is affected. Hope and hope, but no results, the nail has not changed one iota since the day I started using this stuff. YMMV but I can&#x27;t recommend it based on my experience.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical buying this product until I forgot to bring it with me during a business trip. The fungus was going away but to slow to really notice. After one week of skipping treatment the fungus almost doubled in size! So it is working for me but it is very slow and you have put it on at least once a day. I try to do twice a day but I frequently forget. I wish they had a larger size since I use it up pretty quick. I have gone through about 3 tubes and estimate in all it will take 6-8 tubes. I think it would have been gone much quicker if I didnt skip that one week. Also I do get frequent peticures to make sure the nail is really clean.</li>
    <li> Like the ad says, it is safe and super effective. What you must keep in mind is that toe nails grow very slow so it will take time to see results....and you must be diligent with the product. I use it 2x a day completely covering the nail and cutical and completely under the tip. The yellow color is leaving and the space under the nail tip is healing back to the nail bed. Remember, you have to be patient and diligent.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products for toenail fungus without any results that is noticeable. I happened to&lt;br /&gt;see this product on Amazon and decided to try it. It is slow,but, all 5 nails on my foot had fungus and I am now down to just a little left on 2 nails. Try this one, give it time. Be patient!!</li>
    <li> I had a pretty bad case of fungus on my big toenail and pinky toe. Not sure how it happened, but figured it was from playing a lot of soccer in the heat and wearing non cotton socks with closed toe shoes at work. Hint. Prevention is definitely the way to go! Gotta keep them little piggies clean and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used this product for a short time so I can&#x27;t give much of an opinion. It didn&#x27;t seem to do much after a couple weeks, but that&#x27;s not enough time to accurately assess it&#x27;s effectiveness.  Unless you&#x27;re on a super budget I would highly recommend going to the doc. I got a referal to a podiatrist who prescribed Lamasil and some expensive gel product which basically killed the fungus. However, it still took several months for the healthy new nail to &amp;#34;push out&amp;#34; the dead nail. A lot of hiding my toes in the meantime. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product please. Is not a nail fungus treatment is a nail conditioner it says it on the tube. I have tried this product over a month and have not seen the difference</li>
    <li> Keractil is a great product.  I have tried other treatments but no success.  I see an improvement with Keractil.  My toe nails are almost clear of the fungus.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products, but this one actually seems to help. It has cleared up much of the under nail gunk, and has helped with appearance. After the nail polish comes off, we&#x27;ll see what happens!</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was not working, but soon I did see an improvement in my nails.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about a week and a half now with very good results. The yellowing is starting to subside, and the cracked layers are beginning to merge back together.</li>
    <li> I never ever went without nail polish in the past 6 years due to yellow thick gross looking big toe nail. I tried EVERYTHING. Only thing that was constant was that I kept losing the same nail. I bought this on a whim and I am so glad I did! I wasnt even expecting it to work but its been 2 months and my nail looks so much better. I am very impressed and happy</li>
    <li> I did not use this product for a fungus.  I had 4 nails on my hands that just kept peeling and chipping, and would not grow.  I tried many things on the market.  One of the nail polishes did work, but you had to put it on every 2 days.  I decided to try this product just to strengthen and condition my nails.  Over a period of months, my fingernails got stronger, smoother, shinier and as long as I want to keep them.  I am thrilled with the product, and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought it was in liquid form not in a tube. I have been using since it arrived. i don&#x27;t have complete results yet.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I did not see great improvement with this product.  It is nice to have options.  I went with a different company and product.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from toenail fungus for years and nothing seemed to work...I asked my doctor for help and was told to just wear nail polish because any pill out there could damage your liver..Then I found this and within two weeks I could see the change...It is a little on the costly side but it does work...</li>
