      <li>/&gt;(You know how it is when a product is great and the company decides to make it &#x27;new and</li>
      <li>Love how easily it packs away in my overnight case for traveling.</li>
      <li>Phillips makes the best synthetic material brushes, and in fact, they work better for me than any other - including Mason-Pearson, for you brush snobs.</li>
      <li>However, this one did and easily I might add.</li>
      <li>Best brush in the world, practical in size, firm for my type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I purchased the Brush for my wife, after her telling me how much she liked her friend&#x27;s Brush.</li>
      <li>absolutely recommend the brush!!!</li>
      <li>The Phillips Brush Light Touch provides extraordinary detangling to fine hair, or processed hair with out damaging or overstressing hair strands.  </li>
      <li>I bought my first Phillips Light Touch Brush (purse size) better than fifteen years ago</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone honestly.  </li>
      <li>the fact that I&#x27;ve spent years looking for the perfect brush, it&#x27;s high praise to say I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
      <li>They feel good and last forever!</li>
      <li>I love this brush it works so well for brushing my kids hair gently.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, if you love your hair and would like to treat it well.</li>
      <li>In addition they are a great gift for older folk who may have especially tender scalps</li>
      <li>Great little brush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for touch ups when I&#x27;m on the go, but would not use for regular styling due to the static problem.</li>
      <li>This is a high quality product, not at all like the cheaply made brushes sold in drug and grocery stores.</li>
      <li>My hair is waist-length and super straight.</li>
      <li>This is the exact brush I was looking for and could not find in the store any longer</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend Phillips Brush Light Touch for anyone who has fine delicate hair.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce nearly the same amount of flyaways and static as my plain Goody&#x27;s brush, and does a really good job at smoothing my hair without flattening it.</li>
      <li>The bristles have the little plastic tips which are always nice.</li>
      <li>They go through most fine to medium thick hair without scratching or tearing.</li>
      <li>Gentle on the scalp.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.  </li>
      <li>Love the Wet Brush.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy and quality craftsmanship.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was fast.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be using it too much.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair, but I imagine it should work very well on straight hair as well.</li>
      <li>Like the brush, doesn&#x27;t seem very purse sized to me.</li>
      <li>Ok product, but check out the Wet Brush also.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly, highly recommended.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Believe it or not we bought this quite a few years ago and it&#x27;s a great brush my husband loves it, it&#x27;s in perfect shape</li>
    <li> I purchased the Brush for my wife, after her telling me how much she liked her friend&#x27;s Brush. Now she has her own Phillips Brush and loves it, and me for buying it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush it works so well for brushing my kids hair gently. It does seem to work a little better for shorter hair because it seems to make long hair a bit statickey but still works well. Especially good for slicking hair for ponytails and braids.</li>
    <li> high quality brush that will last at least a decade, or until my hair falls completely.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, smooths hair without damage.  Great purse size.</li>
    <li> Best brush in the world, practical in size, firm for my type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this brushes for the last 15 years, got it stolen in a hotel and just replaced it, but they would last for ever</li>
    <li> Phillips makes the best synthetic material brushes, and in fact, they work better for me than any other - including Mason-Pearson, for you brush snobs. And they last. They go through most fine to medium thick hair without scratching or tearing. In addition they are a great gift for older folk who may have especially tender scalps</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend Phillips Brush Light Touch for anyone who has fine delicate hair.  The Phillips Brush Light Touch provides extraordinary detangling to fine hair, or processed hair with out damaging or overstressing hair strands.  I bought 6 units to give it as gifts to family members whose hair range from a 4 year old with fine curly hair who used to cry when her hair got brushed with other hair brushes, to her grandmother&#x27;s hair which is chemically treated.</li>
    <li> Why oh why did I not find this brush years ago before I plunked down over 100 dollars on a Mason Pearson brush? Because this little punch of bristled power out-performs the Pearson easily. I was worried about using the Phillips because I have very thick hair and must soft bristled brushes cannot go through all the way to the scalp. However, this one did and easily I might add. Also, I have dry scalp and found that the rounded tips of these bristles don&#x27;t aggravate my skin or cause flaking. It doesn&#x27;t produce nearly the same amount of flyaways and static as my plain Goody&#x27;s brush, and does a really good job at smoothing my hair without flattening it. I thought the size was a little too small, but it actually works out just fine and, as a result of its tiny size, fits into my cosmetic bag rather nicely...which is good b/c I hate keeping a brush in the main body of a purse as it tends to deposit hair at the bottom. Nothing like going in to grab a bit of something and coming out with numerous strands of hair sticking to everything you own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great size, solid feeling construction, and does a good job on my hair.  Love how easily it packs away in my overnight case for traveling.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Perfect for purse and I will buy another one.</li>
    <li> Quality, looks, size. Classy little brush. Best ever. Love the pale pink for my little girls. Doesn&#x27;t scratch their scalps, but gets through wet hair and tangles in fine hair.</li>
    <li> I picked this brush up for carrying in my purse, but find myself reaching for it instead of the one on my dresser. My hair is waist-length and super straight. This brush keeps it shiny and tangle-free. My boyfriend grabs this brush whenever he sees it and has said he plans to get one just like it for himself. (I may have to surprise him!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the fact that I&#x27;ve spent years looking for the perfect brush, it&#x27;s high praise to say I&#x27;ve found it. Now, I may get another one for the dresser and toss the more expensive one on my dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really nice. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best brush I&#x27;ve had in years. I have shoulder length, fairly thick hair. This brush glides through it. I was so impressed that I ordered a full size brush for the house. I highly recommend this brush. It does not snag your hair. I don&#x27;t know how they made this little brush but it is amazing.</li>
    <li> Like the brush, doesn&#x27;t seem very purse sized to me. Maybe my purse isn&#x27;t as big as the average womans purse, who knows. Still a good brush.</li>
    <li> A friend had this brush in her purse and I used it on my daughter and wow - what a great travel gem this is.  I highly recommend it to anyone honestly.  It brushes your hair great and keeps those fly away hairs in place.  Its great for all types of hair -plus the quality is awesome.  Don&#x27;t even think twice - you&#x27;ll thank yourself once you use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using these hair brushes for a very long time. It seems they are hard to find. I have given them as gifts also. I was glad to see them here on Amazon. They are the best!</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush that I like for home, office, and the gym.  Very sturdy and quality craftsmanship.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Made to last!</li>
    <li> I keep one in my gym bag the other one I was going to use for travel, but ended up liking it so much, I now use it daily.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush for keeping in a purse or throwing in your bag when traveling.  It&#x27;s a small brush so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.  The bristles have the little plastic tips which are always nice.</li>
    <li> Great size brush for purse or travel. I&#x27;ve always loved Phillips brand. They feel good and last forever!</li>
    <li> My mother who is a 76 year old retired hairdresser who used to whine every time I combed her hair until I used this brush...Now the brushes seem to disappear every time one of my 3 girls appear.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my hubby and he loves how gental it feels on his scalp while brushing, and it does wonders on his hair.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Phillips Light Touch Brush (purse size) better than fifteen years ago (that is no lie, in fact it&#x27;s probably closer to twenty years!).  It is extremely well made, works great on thick hair, is comfortable in the hand and is a great size to tuck into any purse.  I haven&#x27;t even started using my new brush yet but figure that when I do it will probably last for the rest of my life.  A great investment and a fine product.</li>
    <li> My Family thinks there better the sliced bread</li>
    <li> I have very thick long hair and I LOVE this brush.  My sister stole it, so I ordered through Amazon.  Now my hair is happy again.</li>
    <li> Very good brush for traveling.</li>
    <li> PERFECT size for your purse. Amazingly awesome. Highly recommended, if you love your hair and would like to treat it well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple hair brush that keeps my hair shiny and fits in my purse. I was reading all the good reviews and decided to order one. Came in today and i could&#x27;nt be more happy with my purchase. Time to say thank you to the ones who take the time to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend the brush!!!</li>
    <li> I have long stick straight hair that&#x27;s prone to tangling and split ends. This brush glides through my hair and works out the tangles without breaking my hair. It&#x27;s relatively small, so it also travels well. I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> The quality of this hair brush exceeds my expectations.  The size is perfect for a purse or cosmetics bag. I have curly hair, but I imagine it should work very well on straight hair as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a harder time finding comfortable brushes since my hair started to thin out. Most brushes felt like needles on my scalp. Not this one happily. Firm enough that I can feel it going deeply in my hair but built such that there&#x27;s only soft tips on your scalp. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the exact brush I was looking for and could not find in the store any longer I even bought in the bigger size too.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a hairbrush to replace the one my husband had in his possession for over 20, maybe almost 30 years. He complained that he could never find one that have soft bristles that will not hurt his scalp when he combs his hair. I read the reviews and had high hopes that this will replace the old one he has. I ordered it for him and it was perfect! I tried using it one time and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on a young child.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast.  Product is of excellent quality...worth every penny...you get what you pay for!  I am very satisfied with my purchase...it&#x27;s perfect for my handbag.  Will be getting the bigger brush next.  I have no doubt that these brushes last a lifetime....more than I can say for the hairbrushes I&#x27;ve bought in the past!</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes!!!!!  As a matter of fact, I have now ordered four of them as my daughter and sister love them as well  : )</li>
    <li> I bought a Phillips Light Touch Brush while looking for a replacement for my beloved but dying brush.  The Phillips worked so well not only on my hair, but on my daughter&#x27;s tangle-prone hair, that we bought another, an also bought the purse sized brush.  Unfortunately, the bristles on the purse sized brush are set up differently - they have clusters with multiple bristles in each cluster.  There may be a difference in materials as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result is terrible static when using this purse brush.  If your hair has any tendency towards fly-aways, you may have a halo rather than a hair style after using this brush.</li>
    <li> I have short thick hair with a fine texture.  I prefer nylon brushes.  This reminds me of the Fuller hair brushes we used  when I was a child.  I like the small size for travel.  This is a high quality product, not at all like the cheaply made brushes sold in drug and grocery stores.</li>
    <li> I like the size. it fits in my purse. however, when I push my hair, it creates so much static. I don&#x27;t think I will be using it too much.</li>
    <li> I have 3 of the regular sizes of this hair brush.  This one fits in my purse nicely.  I hope Phillips continues to make this hair brush and doesn&#x27;t try to improve it.  I don&#x27;t want to try any other style.  This one is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You know how it is when a product is great and the company decides to make it &#x27;new and improved&#x27;...then it no longer is the great product you liked.  Philips - don&#x27;t do this.)</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSH THAT IS GENTLE AND YET BRUSHES HAIR WELL</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for my purse.  It works well, but does cause static electricity in my hair.  It&#x27;s great for touch ups when I&#x27;m on the go, but would not use for regular styling due to the static problem.</li>
    <li> I always get the Phillips brushes for my family, once you use one you would never go back to any other hair brush.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes as gifts for girl friends after getting one for myself. The brush is wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great little brush.  Larger than a mini brush.  I use mine every day and love it.</li>
    <li> I have one in each bathroom &amp; one in my bag....have given 4 as gifts!  Best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Really like the brush, performs well so far with no bristles falling out. Gentle on the scalp. So far wife loves it. The big con is that it was made in China.</li>
    <li> There was only one place I could find these brushes and that was in McAllen, Texas. Was thrilled when I saw them on Amazon.  The only brush my family and I have used for 20 years - the bristles don&#x27;t pull hair, absolutely the only brush I ever want to have.</li>
    <li> I tried this brush and the Wet Brush.  Love the Wet Brush.  Not particularly impressed with this one.  I got it for my girls originally, but it is not soft enough for them.  Even with my hair it is a little too stiff.  Ok product, but check out the Wet Brush also.</li>
