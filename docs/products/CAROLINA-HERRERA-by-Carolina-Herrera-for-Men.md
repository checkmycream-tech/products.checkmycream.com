      <li>of the high end stuff impressed me  </li>
      <li>My husband was thrilled that I found one of his favorite scents.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this purchase, it was what i expected, for me this is an excellent item, thanks.</li>
      <li>I love CH for men.</li>

      <li>Love it every time.</li>
      <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it and so will your lady, period.</li>
      <li>I have had as many men ask me what I wear as women</li>
      <li>middle notes play just perfect!</li>
      <li>I am so glad I happened to check for it at Amazon.</li>
      <li>i love you....</li>
      <li>This one is my husband&#x27;s favorite for many years.</li>
      <li>Is there ANYTHING YOU CAN&#x27;T GET HERE?????????  :-)</li>
      <li>i have been using this cologne for sometime now, and i love ordering it online, don&#x27;t have to hassle with traffic and lines at the store.</li>
      <li>Even after I retired but have not been able to ever find it for almost 10 years.</li>
      <li>It has a very unique smell and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
      <li>A truly unique smell that gets noticed!</li>
      <li>About 23 years ago I was wandering around a department store and stopped by the Men&#x27;s Fragrence Departmen,t more to checkout the attractive young woman working there than to checkout the fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love the original scent of this perfume</li>
      <li>its smell wonderful,not too strong.  </li>
      <li>the product arrived on time and the scent was genuine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells kind of classy and sophisticated.  </li>
      <li>Product is original, smells great, and will definitely be used for times to come.</li>
      <li>You used to be able to find it in most any drug store or supermarket that carried a decent selection of Men&#x27;s fragrances, but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>when i did get my own bottle, well after high school, i would get women asking me what i was wearing.</li>
      <li>You can see in the box that this is not the original carolina herrera for men.</li>
      <li>You will surely spend far more if you buy Herrera somewhere else.</li>
      <li>this old perfume has been and will always be a favorite to me :)</li>
      <li>Amazons prices are about the same as the Duty Free shops in the airports, so that&#x27;s a good thing</li>
      <li>Neroli and citruses present pleasantly and make it fresh.&lt;br</li>
      <li>to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected.</li>
      <li>Maybe my chemistry at my age or the cool temperatures.  </li>
      <li>but overall was good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking this would be a great one for a 30-50 year old man in Little Rock, but a guy in his 60&#x27;s in Astoria, OR might like a cool nautical better.</li>
      <li>Worth the purchase, I would say.</li>
      <li>Beautiful classic fragrance unlike any other from a recognized name.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my most favorite, clean masculine, romantic colognes I have used in years.</li>
      <li>Everyone always wants to know what I am wearing because it is so unique and pleasing to smell.  </li>
      <li>Price was right.  </li>
      <li>That photo could be the best describing for this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s divine, clean, pure, powerful, young, masculine, sweet and bitter, sharp a bit, natural, classic, vintage, alluring, seductive, charming, handsome and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It arrived NEW &amp; GENUINE.</li>
      <li>thank you very much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so chic and young, powerful and rich.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She immediately came over to help me out and we started going through the higher end offerings.</li>
      <li>I found this fragrance at Walla Walla many years ago, here in Spokane, only selected stores sell it.</li>
      <li>THE SCENT FOR REAL MEN!</li>
      <li>This is the first time we have purchased this</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m never bored by it.</li>
      <li>I have no idea why such a great masculine scent was discontinued in major department stores.</li>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the smell of this cologne is wonderful</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase, it was what i expected, for me this is an excellent item, thanks.</li>
    <li> About 23 years ago I was wandering around a department store and stopped by the Men&#x27;s Fragrence Departmen,t more to checkout the attractive young woman working there than to checkout the fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She immediately came over to help me out and we started going through the higher end offerings. I was ready to purchase something just because of the personalized service and the fact that she was smokin Hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the high end stuff impressed me  and she agreed with me. She then said, I have one for you, she pulled out a brown box with pink polka dots from under the counter, it was Herrera For Men and they didn&#x27;t even have an open sample bottle on display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She proceeded to open it and before she sprayed it, she leaned over the counter to me and quitely whispered \\&quot;this one makes me wet\\&quot;. I was sold and she was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This fragrance rocks the office, you can see the women taking in a deep breath in your wake after you walk off the elevator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never saw that sales girl again and It looks like the brown box with pink polka dots has been updated, but I&#x27;ve also have never purchased a different Men&#x27;s Fragrence for the past 23 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get complements on it all the time and questions about, what are you wearing? It smells great. I tell them Herrera For Men, and the response is always the same, \\&quot;never heard of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why I say, I&#x27;m glad that this is getting harder to find. You used to be able to find it in most any drug store or supermarket that carried a decent selection of Men&#x27;s fragrances, but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stocked up now with what is likely a lifetime&lt;br /&gt;supply off of Amazon just in case the quit making this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and, women who know what they like!&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccommened for any man that I don&#x27;t personnaly work or hang out with!</li>
    <li> What is the origin of this product( Made in....) ?</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my husband and love the way it smells on him! It&#x27;s a great pick, guys! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> perfect scent for my husband! great price!</li>
    <li> I love CH for men. Great seller</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped in tjme</li>
    <li> Truly one of the best colognes, ever!  This is my go to cologne for a night out on the town, and I always get a few compliments.</li>
    <li> This one is my husband&#x27;s favorite for many years. I like it also.</li>
    <li> Good smell, lots of compliments...</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this as it spells/wears just like it should.  I know someone reported a possible older batch from one of the retailers being &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  This bottle was spot on and we are so happy we can still order it.  A truly unique smell that gets noticed!</li>
    <li> I am a very picky person when it comes to men&#x27;s cologne and women&#x27;s perfumes.  I only use Herrera.  Nothing comes close to Herrera for Men.  It has a very unique smell and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  It&#x27;s sure to set yourself apart from the traditional guy cologne&#x27;s and old man musks out there.  Everyone always wants to know what I am wearing because it is so unique and pleasing to smell.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it and so will your lady, period.</li>
    <li> This phenomenon is the best release by the company.&lt;br /&gt;It opens so so chic and pleasant. In the beginning it opens with lots of lavender (which I&#x27;m crazy about) and rosemary which makes it sharp and peppery but not harsh and annoying. Neroli and citruses present pleasantly and make it fresh.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so chic and young, powerful and rich. Do you remember the ad of CH? That photo could be the best describing for this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s divine, clean, pure, powerful, young, masculine, sweet and bitter, sharp a bit, natural, classic, vintage, alluring, seductive, charming, handsome and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;The middle notes play just perfect! The scent of geranium and clover pet the nose. This repeats for the base and dry down; just a masterpiece. Nobody will dig it, nobody will deny it. I get lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Its longevity is perfect as well as sillage; both perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe a cologne but let&#x27;s just say that I like this particular one because it is classy and distinct. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the other 10 or 15 brands that all basically gear themselves to the high school/college-boys. And to seal the deal: it is the cologne that I&#x27;ve had my husband in for 10 years now and I&#x27;m never bored by it.</li>
    <li> This is an &amp;#34;Old Batch&amp;#34;, or this product has been diluted.  Arrived promptly though.  (But save your money and look elsewhere)</li>
    <li> I will not recomend this product.  Odorless perfume.</li>
    <li> is simply delicious&lt;br /&gt;I love the original scent of this perfume&lt;br /&gt;delivery and packaging fully met&lt;br /&gt;my husband is very happy&lt;br /&gt;I recommend&lt;br /&gt;is the perfect size</li>
    <li> Best scent for men! I found this fragrance at Walla Walla many years ago, here in Spokane, only selected stores sell it. This was a great deal via Amazon.</li>
    <li> THE SCENT FOR REAL MEN!</li>
    <li> Simply AWESOME...this old perfume has been and will always be a favorite to me :)</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne ever!  This is not an imitation brand...it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
    <li> i first had the pleasure of being introduced to this scent while i was in high school. it immediately grabbed my attention and i asked two friends who were wearing it what it was. when i did get my own bottle, well after high school, i would get women asking me what i was wearing. you know it&#x27;s a good scent when people ask you what it is. that being said buying it on amazon for the price listed was a no brainer for me. the product arrived on time and the scent was genuine. beautiful product provided at a very good price, i did shop around and so far i have yet to find a cheaper retailer. thank you amazon yet again for an awesome shopping experience. i love you....</li>
    <li> This is a yearly Christmas gift that my husband loves receiving during Christmas.  He loves the fragrance and doesn&#x27;t need to use but a little.</li>
    <li> This is the first time we have purchased this and my husband was please with the scent a little more than we expected to pay but overall was good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real thing and size. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would receive, but when I saw it, I was very happy.</li>
    <li> It took a week to get here. If that doesn&#x27;t matter to you, then this is the real deal. It is the name brand Herrera (not some fake or rip off). If you need it quick, you may want to go to your local retail store.</li>
    <li> The best stuff out there. Really manly and subtle.</li>
    <li> its smell wonderful,not too strong.  Good price value and love the package, quality is awesome.excellent cologne  thank you very much.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! Everything was as stated by the seller</li>
    <li> Start using it right away when it initially came out and haven&#x27;t worn anything else since.</li>
    <li> Smells great my wife is always complementing me on how good I smell!!</li>
    <li> I have used this forever. Even after I retired but have not been able to ever find it for almost 10 years. Go figure....here it is on Amazon! After reading some negative reviews about alleged FAKE bottles of this fragrance I was really afraid to order. But wanted it so bad I just stuck my neck out. It arrived NEW &amp; GENUINE. It was factory sealed and in the exact same box &amp; bottle as I have gotten since this was invented. So if you love it like I do, NO problem. It IS the real deal. Please note that I bought DIRECTLY from Amazon &amp; NOT through one of it&#x27;s subliterary storefronts or 3rd party vendors! I am ordering a 2nd bottle today since Amazon has it WAY cheaper than the one I just bought here a week ago. I have had as many men ask me what I wear as women and i KNOW that is hard to do since I would never have the nerve to do it...I am so glad I happened to check for it at Amazon. Is there ANYTHING YOU CAN&#x27;T GET HERE?????????  :-)</li>
    <li> This is my Husbands favorite scent, it smells so nice !</li>
    <li> received as expected, no problems</li>
    <li> The best scent I&#x27;ve ever had since I have permission for using one of the kind,&lt;br /&gt;others make me feel as if I was using nothing else but water with alcohol...</li>
    <li> Un aroma especial que con el transcurrir del tiempo aun levanta suspiros en las mujeres cuando lo huelen. Lo recomiendo excelente como toda creacion de carolina herrera.</li>
    <li> I hear that all the time when I use this. I have maybe 20 bottles of cologne, but this is my go to brand, and has been for the last 20 years. I guess &amp;#34;What are you wearing?&amp;#34; could be taken the wrong way, but I have enough experience to know when someone ask that, it&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;And Amazons prices are about the same as the Duty Free shops in the airports, so that&#x27;s a good thing too.&lt;br /&gt;So, what are you wearing?</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised, arrived on time at a great price. Very good deal.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband</li>
    <li> This is totally fake, don&#x27;t buy or you will be very disappointed. You can see in the box that this is not the original carolina herrera for men.</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorites for a very long time. This is a sensuous blend Including citrus and tobacco scents (like pipe, not cigs - hahaha)  As a younger man (30-40s) and in a hot humid climate in the south, this evoked LOTS of complements from women. They found it very attractive - some indicated exciting.  I think it is too mature for younger men in their teens or 20s. Now years latter and in a cool pacific NW climate, it does not have that sort of sensuousness.  Still &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; and pleasant.  Maybe my chemistry at my age or the cool temperatures.  I&#x27;m thinking this would be a great one for a 30-50 year old man in Little Rock, but a guy in his 60&#x27;s in Astoria, OR might like a cool nautical better. Of course this is all just my opinion.</li>
    <li> best ever i will oder same again again price could go down-little bit its all most half way down so far</li>
    <li> to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations</li>
    <li> Love it every time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> back when i was about sixteen my girlfriend loved it. so at thirty two i had to get it again. a very masculin scent.</li>
    <li> i have been using this cologne for sometime now, and i love ordering it online, don&#x27;t have to hassle with traffic and lines at the store. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for this scent and brand ever since the department stores stopped selling it...I have no idea why such a great masculine scent was discontinued in major department stores. Maybe, it was the price but you couldn&#x27;t beat this price on Amazon! My husband was thrilled that I found one of his favorite scents.</li>
    <li> I made a small mistake with this product...I couldn&#x27;t tell from the small picture, but I thought I was purchasing Carolina Herrera&#x27;s 212 Men&#x27;s spray...instead it was just Carolina Herrera. It is a nice smelling cologne, but I prefer my 212. The packaging is identical, so it tends to confuse the consumer with visual similarities...but this was still my mistake.</li>
    <li> good buy, good service</li>
    <li> Big time fan of this fragrance, I will purchase this hands down over any other fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the sprayer on this latest purchase is problematic, the plunger stays down after you depress the nozzle so more than one spray within 5 mins or so is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;Have others who purchased this product had similar issues with this seller?&lt;br /&gt;I have worn this fragrance for years &amp; have never experienced a problematic sprayer before.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I wanted, nothing less. Product is original, smells great, and will definitely be used for times to come.</li>
    <li> Classic cologne! Great buy with quick shipment and of course, quality product! Will order again from here!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and delicious scent at a great price. You will surely spend far more if you buy Herrera somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Great price fantastic my husband loves this cologne</li>
    <li> Beautiful classic fragrance unlike any other from a recognized name.  Been wearing it for years. Delivery prompt.  Price was right.  Compare, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> not happy with it ,it goes away after 4 hours !</li>
    <li> This is one of my most favorite, clean masculine, romantic colognes I have used in years.</li>
    <li> This is a nice fragrance.  It has sort of a uniquely spicy type of scent, but it&#x27;s different, hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells kind of classy and sophisticated.  So nice, but not Wow!  It&#x27;s pretty good.  Worth the purchase, I would say.</li>
    <li> Great memories the fragrance!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have had trouble finding it where I live now.  But now I know where to get this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and good it&#x27;s high quality</li>
    <li> Got it in a timely manner smells good.</li>
    <li> I used this perfume 10 years ago, I did not buy it back because he did not remember actually. I make the purchase (Shipping and delivery by Amazon was very fast) with the plot if it was the same smell of long ago, amazingly is the same! The scent is exquisite highly recommend it, when I finish this I will buy another without thinking.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat disappointed in this product it does not smell like what I remember the original to be. Perhaps I got a bottle that has been sitting in the warehouse for a while? Or even worse maybe a fake? I do like how it smells but its seems just a little of..</li>
    <li> Received as expected and on time</li>
    <li> Have been using this fragrance for years. I remember it lasted longer than what it does, but that might be just me. Definitely will recommend this to others.</li>
