### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best of all, it becomes invisible on your skin ...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best I can find.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!!!</li>
      <li>it is just as effective as a mantle thank god!</li>
      <li>But this is the best substitute I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
      <li>I tried it and found it to be 95% as good.  </li>
      <li>It is almost as good</li>
      <li>I am so happy Risabal is available.  </li>
      <li>Risabal-Ph Cream is a good replacement but is not as good as the original Acid Mantle cream.  </li>
      <li>Great product, replaces acid mantle at a much lower cost.</li>
      <li>I found this hand cream to be okay.</li>
      <li>and it is the best product I have found for dry, cracked skin.  </li>
      <li>Not an easy product to find.  </li>
      <li>BUT IT WORKS FINE</li>
      <li>I tried a cream then called \\&quot;Acid Mantle\\&quot; and now sold as Amantle Skin Restorer (available through Amazon.com for $87/pound).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While searching Amazon&#x27;s site, that provides a wealth of free information, I came across this product as an alternative, and at about 40% the price of Amantle/Acid Mantle.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this instead of AMantle,which I had used for years.but for some reason was no longer available.</li>
      <li>Risabal-ph cream works great on dry skin and it has no aroma.</li>
      <li>The cream is good, but the Amantle was thicker and went further.  </li>
      <li>I have not found Risabal-ph to work as quickly of as well.</li>
      <li>It is a wonderful product that simulates natural sebum (your own skin wax), plus it is slightly acidified that is protective to human skin.  </li>
      <li>may or may not pay for it (unless your doctor will prescribe it for you), but the relief is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>but now I can get here- shipped very fast</li>
      <li>This has almost the exact ingredients and works well.</li>
      <li>I have eczema on my hands and have bought Amantle cream for the past several years and it worked great!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>If your skin is cracked and/or bleeding, you need to address the issue of infection  FIRST, before using this cream.  </li>
      <li>Plus, the price was completely reasonable; the price for Amantle kept going up by leaps and bounds every time I ordered it</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>acid mantle has not been available for several months from the producers.</li>
      <li>None really worked OR they made my hands greasy all day.  </li>
      <li>Really works for chronic skin conditions.</li>
      <li>When I saw that Amantle was no longer available, I was in a panic, then I discovered this Risabal Cream which in my opinion, is no different than Amantle.  </li>
      <li>Got what I wanted at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bring the original Acid Mantle Cream back.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to find it, but was used to the other cream, which the pharmacist said they can&#x27;t get.</li>
      <li>But, the price sure hasn&#x27;t gone down.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as thick as A-Mantle cream, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to heal my skin quite as well, but it&#x27;s a really close 2nd, and since A-Mantle isn&#x27;t available any more</li>
      <li>I recommend Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, Non-comedogenic as an alternative.</li>
      <li>Looks exactly the same.</li>
      <li>My skin is very delicate, so the Risabal-ph was gentle and went on very easily.  </li>
      <li>I had used acid mantle cream previously and now it is no longer available - this product is almost exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone with sensitive and allergic skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like the old acid mantle--very soothing and comforting--at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
      <li>Took a chance and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Good, but like its predecessor AMantle or Acid Mantle, is frequently expensive or unavailable.</li>
      <li>over time my hands started to heal and are back to my normal soft hands-  </li>
      <li>I generally apply it liberally all over my hands at bedtime, and as needed after washing or cooking during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Risabal-pH works very well as a substitute at far less cost.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using A-Mantle for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find any, so I tried this product and so far it&#x27;s &amp;#34;great&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>As a nurse I wash my hands frequently each day and I always found Acid Mantle would heal my dry skin rapidly.</li>
      <li>I have had a problem with chronically dry skin on my hands to the point of splitting open almost all of my adult life and Acid Mantle, later known as Amantle, was the only product that worked for me.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m a Pharmacist by training and have always suffered from dry skin, especially in the Winter when the relative humidity drops or after having my hands in water for extended periods.  </li>
<li> but apparently it is no longer made.  </li>
<li> The price had nearly doubled a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll continue to purchase as long as price remains within reason.</li>
<li> Also as a Pharmacist, I had access to non-prescription ointments and creams generally unknown to the public but used to \\&quot;compound\\&quot; dermatological prescriptions.  </li>
<li> I agree with the other reviewer, this product is very, very similar to the Amantle.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what has been taken from this cream, but it does not work well on dry skin now.  </li>
<li> it claims to have the same active ingredient that the Amantle cream had that made it work.....</li>
<li> you suffer from dry skin, give this stuff a try!  </li>
<li> For some unknown reason, Acid Mantle has disappeared from the internet</li>
<li> know what else I could be expected to say.  </li>
<li> After a few weeks, it seems to work the same also.  </li>
<li> I use this on my face and other tender areas.  </li>
<li> I noticed the other reviewer was a pharmacist, which I am also.  </li>
<li> This cream does a great job of clearing/preventing that dry &amp;#34;winter skin.&amp;#34; As someone who used Acid Mantle -- lately called &amp;#34;AManlte&amp;#34; -- for decades, I was very disappointed to discover that its price has risen to three to four times what I paid for RisaBal-ph Cream.</li>
<li> it is NO better than regular hand cream that you buy at the store.......at least for my dry skin.</li>
<li> I subtract the 5% because Risabal appears to be slightly \\&quot;thinner\\&quot; to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and it is half the price.</li>
<li> Because I was not familiar with this product, I researched it on the manufacturer&#x27;s (Rising) website.</li>
<li> it does not feel greasy after a few minutes.  </li>
<li> It is pricey and is definitely not as good as Acid Mantle</li>
<li> not too thick; not too thin.  </li>
<li> the least expensive 16 oz.</li>
<li> Thin, watery when compared to Acid Mantle.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this is not a good replacement for Acid Mantle Cream.  </li>
<li> Sorry to see Acid Mantle go by the wayside.</li>
<li> jar I&#x27;ve found is now around $120.00, which I consider to be too expensive for the product.  </li>
<li> and they responded on 11/7/13 that \\&quot;we are unable to find a listed product with either the NDC number or the product</li>
<li> What a disappointment.  </li>
<li> Amantle (acid-mantle cream) appears to be no longer made and was also very expensive.</li>
<li> I have to say I have been a bit disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, replaces acid mantle at a much lower cost. Use it every night for softer skin. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase as long as price remains within reason.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my hands and have bought Amantle cream for the past several years and it worked great! When the price jumped from $92/1 lb. to $150/LB. I decided to try this Risabal cream....it claims to have the same active ingredient that the Amantle cream had that made it work.....well, it does NOT. Do not be fooled into buying this product....it is NO better than regular hand cream that you buy at the store.......at least for my dry skin. Sometimes I have to reapply it every 5 minutes.  I refuse to pay $150 for a hand cream.....that was a %50 increase!</li>
    <li> I had used acid mantle cream previously and now it is no longer available - this product is almost exactly the same.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The cream is good, but the Amantle was thicker and went further.  My skin is very delicate, so the Risabal-ph was gentle and went on very easily.  I was glad to find it, but was used to the other cream, which the pharmacist said they can&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> Acid Mantle cream is currently off the market and had risen in price from $ 30 to $ 100 a pound jar.  This has almost the exact ingredients and works well.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and other tender areas.  It&#x27;s just like the old acid mantle--very soothing and comforting--at a fraction of the cost.  I recommend it to anyone with sensitive and allergic skin.  It&#x27;s so helpful.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! In my profession I wash and use anti-bacterial hand gel-my hand&#x27;s hurt and crack-1 time I put this on and it was instant relief. over time my hands started to heal and are back to my normal soft hands-  I could only get in my phar but now I can get here- shipped very fast</li>
    <li> I found this hand cream to be okay. It is supposed to have the same composition as Acid Mantle which is no longer being made. I have to say I have been a bit disappointed. As a nurse I wash my hands frequently each day and I always found Acid Mantle would heal my dry skin rapidly. I have not found Risabal-ph to work as quickly of as well.</li>
    <li> Amantle (acid-mantle cream) appears to be no longer made and was also very expensive. Risabal-pH works very well as a substitute at far less cost.</li>
    <li> acid mantle has not been available for several months from the producers. i have tried several alternates; nothing worked until i found risabal. it is just as effective as a mantle thank god! i have excema on my hands.  ps ifound one jar of amantle on amazon for 450 dollars! an entrepeneur no doubt.</li>
    <li> not too thick; not too thin.  I&#x27;ve been using A-Mantle for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find any, so I tried this product and so far it&#x27;s &amp;#34;great&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Good, but like its predecessor AMantle or Acid Mantle, is frequently expensive or unavailable. I recommend Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, Non-comedogenic as an alternative.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this is not a good replacement for Acid Mantle Cream.  Bring the original Acid Mantle Cream back.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered this instead of AMantle,which I had used for years.but for some reason was no longer available.It is almost as good and I will keep using this product and it is half the price.</li>
    <li> Was in the need of a substitute for Amantle. Took a chance and was pleasantly surprised. Looks exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Got what I wanted at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what else I could be expected to say.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I am so happy Risabal is available.  I have had a problem with chronically dry skin on my hands to the point of splitting open almost all of my adult life and Acid Mantle, later known as Amantle, was the only product that worked for me. When I saw that Amantle was no longer available, I was in a panic, then I discovered this Risabal Cream which in my opinion, is no different than Amantle.  Plus, the price was completely reasonable; the price for Amantle kept going up by leaps and bounds every time I ordered it and hopefully the same won&#x27;t happen with Risabal.</li>
    <li> This cream does a great job of clearing/preventing that dry &amp;#34;winter skin.&amp;#34; As someone who used Acid Mantle -- lately called &amp;#34;AManlte&amp;#34; -- for decades, I was very disappointed to discover that its price has risen to three to four times what I paid for RisaBal-ph Cream. RisaBal does the job!</li>
    <li> GREASY..... BUT IT WORKS FINE</li>
    <li> Because I was not familiar with this product, I researched it on the manufacturer&#x27;s (Rising) website. The NDC (drug code) listed on the label and on the website is 64980-321-45. I could not find this code in the online NDC database of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). I e-mailed FDA on 11/6/13 and they responded on 11/7/13 that \\&quot;we are unable to find a listed product with either the NDC number or the product name\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Wish we could still get this - somewhere - anywhere!!!  Really works for chronic skin conditions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Pharmacist by training and have always suffered from dry skin, especially in the Winter when the relative humidity drops or after having my hands in water for extended periods.  As a Pharmacist, I had access to and tried virtually every OTC moisturizer and skin remedy.  None really worked OR they made my hands greasy all day.  Also as a Pharmacist, I had access to non-prescription ointments and creams generally unknown to the public but used to \\&quot;compound\\&quot; dermatological prescriptions.  I tried a cream then called \\&quot;Acid Mantle\\&quot; and now sold as Amantle Skin Restorer (available through Amazon.com for $87/pound).  It is a wonderful product that simulates natural sebum (your own skin wax), plus it is slightly acidified that is protective to human skin.  Best of all, it becomes invisible on your skin ... it does not feel greasy after a few minutes.  BUT $87/pound is a  lot of money!  The price had nearly doubled a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While searching Amazon&#x27;s site, that provides a wealth of free information, I came across this product as an alternative, and at about 40% the price of Amantle/Acid Mantle.  I tried it and found it to be 95% as good.  I subtract the 5% because Risabal appears to be slightly \\&quot;thinner\\&quot; to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from dry skin, give this stuff a try!  It does NOT require a prescription and your drug coverage may or may not pay for it (unless your doctor will prescribe it for you), but the relief is worth the price.  REMEMBER, this product is not designed to be antibacterial.  If your skin is cracked and/or bleeding, you need to address the issue of infection  FIRST, before using this cream.  I find that a one pound jar lasts me 12-18 months.  I generally apply it liberally all over my hands at bedtime, and as needed after washing or cooking during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT WORK FOR ANY COMPANY AND AM NOT BEING PAID TO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I AM SIMPLY A SUFFERER WHO USES IT AND FINDS IT BENEFICIAL!</li>
    <li> We used to purchase this product when it was called Acid Mantle, it was then changed to A/Mantle and now to this Risabal-ph Cream, there is no comparison to the Acid Mantle.  I don&#x27;t know what has been taken from this cream, but it does not work well on dry skin now.  What a disappointment.  My husband works with his hands, the Acid Mantle used to heal his cracks and rid him of the peeling of his fingers.  It does nothing now.  But, the price sure hasn&#x27;t gone down.  This product does not justify it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Amantle (formerly known as Acid Mantle) for years and it is the best product I have found for dry, cracked skin.  However, the price has kept going up and up and the least expensive 16 oz. jar I&#x27;ve found is now around $120.00, which I consider to be too expensive for the product.  I saw this product listed next to the Amantle, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I noticed the other reviewer was a pharmacist, which I am also.  I agree with the other reviewer, this product is very, very similar to the Amantle.  It feels and smells the same.  After a few weeks, it seems to work the same also.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I had used Doak&#x27;s  Acid Mantle for years to control eczema. For some unknown reason, Acid Mantle has disappeared from the internet I saw several reviews that indicated Risabal  was a comparable replacement. It is pricey and is definitely not as good as Acid Mantle but I use it anyway. I will probably not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used acid mantle from the 1980&#x27;s but apparently it is no longer made.  Risabal-Ph Cream is a good replacement but is not as good as the original Acid Mantle cream.  Sorry to see Acid Mantle go by the wayside.</li>
    <li> It used to be called \\&quot;acid mantle cream.\\&quot;  It is the same thing just different name.  The cream cleared up eczema within a week.</li>
    <li> Not an easy product to find.  Local physician needed us to use for a customized compound we prepared in our pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;Received it as promised.  Thank You</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite as thick as A-Mantle cream, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to heal my skin quite as well, but it&#x27;s a really close 2nd, and since A-Mantle isn&#x27;t available any more it&#x27;s the best I can find.</li>
    <li> Thin, watery when compared to Acid Mantle. Somebody out there, bring Acid Mantle back! But this is the best substitute I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
    <li> Risabal-ph cream works great on dry skin and it has no aroma. It soothes my hands and the cracks on my fingertips.</li>
