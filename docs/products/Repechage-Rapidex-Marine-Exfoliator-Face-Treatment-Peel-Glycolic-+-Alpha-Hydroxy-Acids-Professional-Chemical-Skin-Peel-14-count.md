    <li> Delivery is very good.&lt;br /&gt;But it was opened and 2 ampules are missed.</li>
    <li> According to my friends it made my face a bit brighter and younger, but didn&#x27;t really remove the darker spots on my skin.

    <li> I love this! It makes bright and smooth my face and helps easy to accept other skin care products.</li>
    <li> I love this product. With my face flashes. It is recommended for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation, facial settlement.&lt;br /&gt;Repurchase plan to continue to use.</li>
    <li> This was a what I expected product.&lt;br /&gt;and delivery was also fast.</li>
    <li> when I got the rapdex, the case was broken. I was a little disappointed but it was ok because the real things inside was fine.&lt;br /&gt;However once I have opened one of 14 rapidexs for the first time, the cotton applicator was supposed to get wet with serum but it was dried. I could not use it and then I opened another one, it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;personally, I love Rapidex but I am not happy that I got defective product..</li>
    <li> My wife loves them !!!!</li>
    <li> First use a sharp feeling under the skin may be flushed is&lt;br /&gt;Over time, skin is red and irritated like symptoms are reduced.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of keratin tend to disappear.</li>
    <li> It is little irritating. It could make your skin red and feel burn. If you have a sensative skin, I do not recommand this product.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work.... this product is not good for my skin . :(</li>
    <li> I purchased for girl friend. She loved so much. Next time also I want to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
