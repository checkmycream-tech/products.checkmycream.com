<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference between the two.</li>
    <li> This razor gets every nook &amp; cranny on my face &amp; head. Smooth, comfortable shave. Very glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this razor, then I remembered with any new change in razors, it must be given a chance for a couple of weeks.  After a few weeks I have come to really like this razor.  It shaves closely for the most part (it still has trouble getting a couple of areas, but I think with a few more weeks even that won&#x27;t be a problem as it&#x27;s getting easier to shave those areas.)  The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this razor is the cost of the replacement blades, even at wal mart they are high priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a four bladed disposable razor for a long time, then I switched to a three bladed razor to cut costs down.  What a mistake.  The three bladed razors would nick my face on a regular basis and showed no sign of ever stopping.  Then BzzAgent sent me this Gillette.  If somebody tells you that multiple bladed razors are just a gimmick.  They&#x27;re lying or don&#x27;t know what their talking about.  I thought the four bladed razor was good.  Gillette Fusion Pro Glide has them beat, but not by much.  It&#x27;s a very comfortable razor and has not once nicked my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave cream that came with the razor has a really good scent (Alpine Clean) I like it very much.  It&#x27;s easy to shave with and rinses very easily and I have not had razor burn.  It&#x27;s a very good shave gel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a smooth gliding  razor , I don&#x27;t have a rash or bumps when I use it. I grew up with Gillette and will stay a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> The Fusion may have been my favorite razor blade for years. The comfort guard, lubricating strip, and easy grip were all huge benefits. The multiple blades gave a great feeling to my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This next generation Fusion is all that and more. It will smooth your face to a baby&#x27;s butt. It&#x27;ll get the hard to reach places. This blade makes it easier than ever to keep your sideburns clean and trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet there&#x27;s one large counter argument - the one against expensive razor blades. Refilling this thing will be pricey and after 5 shaves there is a marked decrease in shave quality. If you have to shave daily or every other day, this can become an expensive habit. Right now there are plenty of great alternative ways to shave that are at a reasonable price point. If price per shave is an issue, then I&#x27;d recommend the alternatives. However, if you want the best blade out there, look no further.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about 5 weeks now and I have really been enjoying the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very fast growing beard(from clean to 1/2&amp;#34; in about 2-3 weeks.) but I only shave about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;This razor has been great. Fast shave, smooth, and feels great. almost no tug even if I go 3-4 days before using it.&lt;br /&gt;I am still on the first disposable blade, and plan to buy more to use with the razor.</li>
    <li> The handle is much heavier then in older models though it&#x27;s too slim for my grip. The pivoting mechanism (Flexball) does not seem to make a big difference in comfort of shaving. Shaving itself is very good as with all Fusion models.</li>
    <li> RIP OFF! I thought this came with handle and 2 bladze as usual for the past what 10yrs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This packaging not worth the money then.</li>
    <li> As a man, I find it frustrating to find the perfect disposable razor to shave with.  I have my electric razor and my mustache/beard trimmer and they serve their purpose.  Yet, there are times I can just get a closer shave with a regular razor, considering how my facial hair grows.  My aggravation with disposable razors is associated with all the gimmicks and fancy names billed with these razors. When it is all said and done they basically are all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leads me to this Gillette \\&quot;Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor with Flexball Handle Technology\\&quot;; see what I mean about fancy names, this one is a mouthful. So is this razor any better than a standard razor?  I would lean towards not really.  As for the razor itself, it comes with five blades, a lubrication strip, the handle is ribbed so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hand.  And the razor itself rests on a ball; this is so it will adjust to the contours of one&#x27;s face for a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow me to tell you what I found after using this razor about four or five times; the razors become very dull, the lubrication strip is mediocre at best (have had better, have had worse), the \\&quot;flexball\\&quot; is really sort of a joke since it seemed like the razor was working against me.  The ribbed handle for a controlled shave is a bit funny; unless a person has a condition where their hands shake uncontrollably I don&#x27;t see how any man is going to have any razor slip out of his grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I did feel like had a nice clean shave with a smooth face after I used this razor.  In contrast, around my fourth or fifth use the blades are becoming a bit shopworn.  Again I realize this is disposable razor, but I feel the blades should last longer than a half a dozen times, especially when the name Gillette is involved.  And for what it is worth, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my face when I used this razor.  In addition, the replacement blades go for about thirty dollars.  I feel that is a great deal of money and I would rather just buy another razor.  Sadly this is a practice done by many companies not just Gillette.  I would love to see a company make a quality razor without all the razzle-dazzle with affordable replacement blades and I would be a customer for life.and I would rather just buy another razor.

    <li> This is Lori&#x27;s husband writing this post.. I received this product from the company to try out and write a review. Overall I have been really happy with the product. I feel like it gave me a great close shave without causing any irritation. So it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.It doesn&#x27;t tug or pull at your hair and glides smoothly over my skin. I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I have a confession to make, but it&#x27;s no longer one I&#x27;m embarrassed about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very, very jagged face. My chin plunges and abruptly swoops upward. My cheekbones sharply point to my jawline, and it&#x27;s all acutely angled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Mach whatevers took too long with too few blades; electric razors didn&#x27;t have the finesse to take on the angles. A shaving track like mine requires a luxury vehicle, and put quite simple, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Flexball is a Mercedes among Kias. After a good month of usage, my shave is as close as I could only previously receive at a barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I was able to sample this product for free directly from the brand itself. That being said, I&#x27;m already in the process of ordering extra blades for the inevitable dulling to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, shaving has been nothing but a chore that often took multiple laps around my face. Even my previous blade of choice, the first version of the Gillette Fusion, required a fair amount of backtracking. I don&#x27;t know much about the science of this &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; or this &amp;#34;Proglide&amp;#34; business, but I do know that it used to take me two or three rinsings to get down and around my chin, but now I can basically do it in one long swoop. It&#x27;s beautiful, even. I can&#x27;t even say I&#x27;m exaggerating. It moves right along with my difficult face demands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it was just a new blade, but after a month&#x27;s worth of quality shaves, I&#x27;m converted. You can get this thing for $15 on the Internet. It&#x27;s a fantastic value, even factoring in the inevitable refills. If a run-of-the-mill store-bought razor hasn&#x27;t impressed you yet, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this bad boy a try. It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s easy, and it gives a complete shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could you want?</li>
    <li> For the most part I maintain a full beard so I really only use a razor to shape it up under the chin on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 for years and while it worked, I always considered trying another razor to see if I could get a smoother shave. The 5 blades are very fine and provide a nice shave without needing to go over it twice (shaving with the grain). It was only when I shaved against the grain did I experience a little bit of razor burn on my neck, but it was pretty minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spring of the head of the razor that allows it to move to the contours of your face is a nice feature but I&#x27;m not sure what the point of the flexball is. I didn&#x27;t notice it ever swiveling as I shaved, but as I mentioned, this was not a full shave so perhaps this was not necessary. It&#x27;s definitely a fancy blade with nice grip and some weight to it that makes it feel like a real tool in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor thing is that it was not obvious to me how to eject the razor head and the packaging came with no instructions on how to do so. I noticed while shaving that the orange button (which I didn&#x27;t know was a button) had some give to it so I pressed it which ejected the head. Glad I worked it out before it went flying into my face.</li>
    <li> I have transitioned over the years as Gillette has improved their technology.  I have tried electric razors but they just cannot cut close enough. I had been using the Proglide Fusion Power before I had the opportunity to try this razor.  I noticed right away that the shave was smoother then the previous generation.  Not sure if the Flexball helps or not but blades are real thin and flex easily. Of the course the downside is the price of the blades.  I still fall back to my Mach 3 from time to time.  I usually wait when a good deal with coupons for Proglides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your are a Gillette user I would recommend moving up to the latest razor technology</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s in a shave?  The elusive perfect shave has been sought after by men since a razor was first used to rid hair from the face. With its great agility, movement and finesse, the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology will launch you into the future of razor technology.  I have taken a giant leap towards the elusive perfect shave.  Its great handling and smooth glide makes it the best yet.  Don&#x27;t waist your time on others.  Use the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the traditional Proglide handle, so was excited to check out the swivel handle.  Unfortunately the action on the handle was a little more than I was comfortable with.  If I was just shaving my face, I could see how the added movement might come in handy.  But I shave my entire head and all the extra flex felt too unpredictable for me.  Probably a great product for some, but Im going to stick to my traditional Proglide handle.</li>
    <li> I really like the gillette fusion proglide razor. The proglide flexball handle is great it makes shaving my face easier and cuts smoothly and closely. I would recommend this to all the guys and ladies that don&#x27; t like there current rwzor.</li>
    <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used. Fits well, stays put. The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale. By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz. I measured a Gillette disposable at 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it. I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced. I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor. Again--felt very solid and well constructed. The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #1,&amp;#34; I did not shave for several days, so that I had a 3-day beard. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard. I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel. I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften. This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck. I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory. As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave. Thus, both the Field Tests confirm the capability of this product. It works as advertised. When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel. With 5 blades closely spaced together, this is not a trivial feat. After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color. The Flexball pivots in 2 different ways. As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction. There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far. You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting. This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever. There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place. This fastener appears to be very solid; I doubt anything will come lose. The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering. It appears to operate flawlessly. All of this is to allow the razor to match the contours of your face. That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. The razor feels very solid. One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris LawsonY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors.

    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with Fkex Ball from Gillette. When I first held it in my hands I noticed the sleek design. The design was very appealing and not cheesy looking. The razor also was well designed ergonomically. It just fit so well in my hand which made shaving easy and pleasant. The pivoting head and flex ball of the razor also made shaving easy and with no razor nicks. The blades on the razor were very sharp and shaving was fast and razor bump free.The design of the blades and the spacing made it easy for me to rinse out build up of hair and I had no clogging problems which arise often with cheap razors and blades. I enjoyed using this razor and will continue to. Good job Gillette! Kudos!</li>
    <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used razors but tend to stay away because I don&#x27;t get close shave and razor bumps, but this razor here is awesome. With the multiple blades,MIT allows you to get close without causing irritation. This is a razor I will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> I received my razor free from Gillette, to test and review a few weeks ago. At first it felt a little awkward due to the precision of the flexball in fact it almost felt like the razor head was loose. However after only a few uses I quickly realized It&#x27;s very smooth, and the swiveling head allows the razor to reach spots that I would normally have to go over again, this includes both disposable and electric razors. It also gives a much smoother shave than I have experienced in the past, with minimal razor burn and/or skin irritation. Definitely worth the price and I will only buy this razor when in need of a a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> I received a razor from Gillette to try and was pleasantly surprised.  You get a close shave and the pivot head really helps get to those hard to reach angles. I recommend this to any man who wants a close shave.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to test and I must say I was thoroughly, and sincerely, surprised.  I honestly expected it to be a gimmicky razor where its key feature was nothing more than a cool novelty to sell a razor but boy was I wrong.  Never have I used a manual razor with the contouring power of this one.  The flexball is NOT a gimmick.  Great razor.  Now my only issue with it is the handle.  When wet the grip can leave something to be desired.</li>
    <li> Like the other razors in the fusion line, the sample I got from Gillette didn&#x27;t disappoint.  These razors give an excellent shave, and while I&#x27;m not sure I see a clear advantage with the ball being added, I certainly don&#x27;t see how it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the power razors, because they seem to cut down on pull a little more, but that could all be in my head.  I&#x27;m not sure there is a power version of the flexball razor, but I&#x27;d likely prefer that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all the Proglide razors as a whole are the smoothest closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten.  I just wish the refills weren&#x27;t as expensive.</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER: I received this razor free from Gillette in order to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;face-hugging&amp;#34; razors off and on since the Sensor first came out, and this one is far better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. The improved contact from the flexball means fewer strokes, and that means a noticeably quicker shave for me. It makes the hard-to-reach spots easier to reach, but it&#x27;s not perfect. Those spots still need a few extra strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this razor gives a niceshave, it&#x27;s not perfect. So this is great for daily use, but if I needed a superior shave, like for an interview or a wedding, I&#x27;d go with a battery-powered Fusion. (I have the standard battery one. I&#x27;d love to try the battery-powered Flexball!)</li>
    <li> May 21st&lt;br /&gt;I used THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE RAZOR WITH FLEXBALL HANDLE TECHNOLOGY for the first time this morning after not shaving for a couple of days. Since I received the product free from Gillette I figured I’d really put it through it’s paces and just used liquid face soap instead of shaving cream after my shower. I was surprised the length of my facial hair did not make my shaving experience miserable. In fact, the razor cut it down with ease. I wasn&#x27;t focused too much on the flexball or handle today (just trying not to pull the hair out my face and neck) I’ll write another review once the blades have had a chance to dull a bit which will be the true test. Let’s face it, every razor gives you a close shave the first time out but the first with this one was very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 23rd&lt;br /&gt;Second shave with THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE RAZOR WITH FLEXBALL HANDLE TECHNOLOGY I’m trying out free from Gillette, still a very close shave today without any nicks or irritation! I looked closer at the handle, noticed how the blade swiveled by being attached by a thin metal line. I like how that works but I’m curious how long it will last as it isn’t part of the blade but rather part of the handle; it doesn&#x27;t get replaced with new blades.</li>
    <li> My son (16yrs) was thrilled to receive this Razor, so thrilled that I thought I should&#x27;ve kept it for myself. Ribbed handles are not common in women&#x27;s razors. The feature really helps when your soapy hand holds a razor in the shower. But he was so excited, talking about how the quality was supposed to be, so I decided I wouldn&#x27;t take it back LOL :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it he says it&#x27;s a really nice razor that doesn&#x27;t have the typical pull he feels with the cheaper razors. In general the razor met what he&#x27;d read in the advertisements and he felt it&#x27;s worth the price. It seems to be lasting longer than his other razors typically do. The single blade on the back of the razor head is somewhat hard to use and doesn&#x27;t really seem necessary. You might use it for more precise cutting. The mobile head allowing the razor to turn more laterally at different angles is nice, but again isn&#x27;t something that you absolutely have to have either. He also tried the &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology With 1 Razor Blade&amp;#34; which seems the same with just a different color handle. (If I&#x27;d known they were the same, I would have surely kept one for mom&#x27;s shower!)&lt;br /&gt;~ Would definitely purchase this again when these wear out.</li>
    <li> I received mine free from Gillette, to test and review a couple of weeks ago. It&#x27;s very smooth, and the swiveling head allows the razor to reach spots that one would normally miss with regular razors, both manual and electric. It also gives a much smoother shave than I have experienced, with a minimum of razor burn or irritation. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I got this razor in the mail from Gillette Fusion. I only shave once every 2 months. The shave was a lot better then the shave I get from my mach 5. Thank you Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Slivertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball from Gillette as a sample. I was excited to try the razor because the company had invested millions of dollars in advertising this advancement in shaving. I was a little disappointed. The razor did a fine job of shaving my face, head and crotch areas. It was sooth and gentle. The problem is the price. It didn&#x27;t perform any better than the one dollar disposable razor I normally buy. Gillette claims the blade will last a month, I got four days from it before the performance became poor, the same amount of time I get from the cheap disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this razor an overall three. I give it five stars for performance, and one star for price. If you don&#x27;t care about price, this is the razor for you. If you are frugal, Gillette offers cheaper razors that perform just as well.</li>
    <li> After using this razor for the last 2 weeks I am a big fan. It is faster than my other Gillette razor and gets a closer shave.  It also shaves wider than my other razor.  I think the time savings might only be in the seconds ( maybe 30) but sometimes in the morning that can help.  I think the blade will last for a while but I have not checked out the replacement blades which can be often more expensive over the long haul.  Could the ball be just another marketing idea - perhaps but it does contour to my face better and allows me to go faster which is nice. The refills  look to be less than 4.00 a razor so that works for me. That is the only reason it dropped a star. I did receive this as a free sample from Gillette to review.</li>
    <li> The flex ball feature of the razor is good and does a good job of keeping the blades in contact with the contours of my face. The multiple blades are nice to help ensure a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with that said, there  some disadvantages with the razor - the biggest issue I had is with the handle of the razor. It is a metallic like finish and when wet is extremely slippery and hard to keep a good grip on. This makes it difficult to hold and get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I did not feel that I got as close of a shave using this razor as I have with other Gillette razors in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the price, I may or may not purchase this razor again.</li>
    <li> One of the best, This is one of the best razors my husband has used.  Clean shaven and no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;  got every inch of hair and he will surely be using this razor from now on.  The flex ball technology is the bomb!</li>
    <li> Decent enough, but prefer the mach 3 strongly.  As the price isn&#x27;t much different, I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars since I&#x27;d say skip it and go for a Mach 3 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34;...yes it can &amp;#34;contour around curves better&amp;#34; but while that&#x27;s great for wide swaths of skin like legs or armpits, it&#x27;s not so good for any detail work in areas with crevices or for which you&#x27;re trying to achieve a specific line.  My partner (I&#x27;m female, but we share a bathroom and share razors...) has a beard and showed me this issue first....he was having trouble keeping the beard lines straight because the razor tried to follow its own path a bit more and he had less fine control of it.  To me this is really more of a minus...even trying to get hair at ankles was harder because it wanders around a bit as soon as it hits anything that&#x27;s not a plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, yes it has more blades, but no that does not seem to improve the shave any over the mach 3...in fact it seems to take more passes to achieve the same effect. It does, however, seem that the increased number of blades and tighter spacing between them make it so that you have to clean it more often (not just between but also during uses) since the spacing between the blades &amp;#34;collects&amp;#34; more.  The handle with the flexball and features also seems to collect scum and whatnot more making the whole thing a messier razor.  Not so good since the handle is the part you keep if you replace blades only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads and handles of the Mach 3 and Proglide with Flexball are not, by the way, interchangeable.  Just FYI...I believe handles and blades are interchangeable within the Proglide family however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle has a nice weight...more curvy than the Mach 3...not sure if this is a care about or not - as long as it doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic and I can use it, I&#x27;m good personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic holder is fine, but not great/not fancy...if you don&#x27;t already have someplace to put your razor...which most people do I&#x27;d think.  Otherwise, be aware that, as of the time of writing this at least, Amazon sells the identical item without the holder (same name) for a dollar or two less....the pictures can tell you which you&#x27;re looking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the razor appears to be of decent quality...good manual razor in general.  Does give clean shaves (even if you have to make a few more passes).  However, I&#x27;d definitely opt for the Mach 3 instead for me.  Partner feels the same.put your razor...which most people do I&#x27;d think.

    <li> I choose 5 stars because this is a 5star product. It glides wonderfully and is great around obstacles. I say obstacles because I have a mole on my face and it was easy to glide around, instead of that missed area I sometimes get this one worked well. I was using the older Gillette razor that was not Proglide and I&#x27;m glad Gillette let me try this for free because I thought my old one was just fine and did the job. This new razor does a better job, and I recommend other brand or Gillette users get this new upgrade!</li>
    <li> This is one impressive razor. And that is a difficult thing to do in this day. What has passed for innovation in recent years is simply adding another blade, i.e. &amp;#34;This one goes to 11!&amp;#34; Because of that I&#x27;ve been using the same old Sensor razor for the past ten years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until this came along. The swiveling mechanism actually does work. The blades follow the contours of my face, which does ensure a close shave and an unblemished outcome.This is a big deal for me, as I have very sensitive skin and usually have a splotchy red face at the end of every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the wife was impressed by how close and clean the shave was. That was just icing on the old cake, as it were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get a fifth star is the price. Replacing these blades regularly is an expensive affair, even though that&#x27;s is par for the course. Just doesn&#x27;t make me happy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Gillette provided this product for me to review.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a free campaign from Gillette.  I know Gillette Fusion very well as I have used them for years.  The newest iteration is the same quality and precision that you&#x27;d expect from Proglide but I don&#x27;t understand the new capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved everyday with this razor since I got it and tried to see if I could see the new flexball in action and I just didn&#x27;t see it pivot the way it&#x27;s designed to.  I just don&#x27;t shave in a manner that would require the razor to pivot from side to side, in fact I try to avoid it because I would think that would lead to cuts.  This is a great razor that gives a fantastic shave but the new flexball featur seems gimmicky to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with anything that Gillette Fusion Proglide can offer but the flexball just didn&#x27;t move for me the way it&#x27;s designed.</li>
    <li> I definitely feel less tugging/pulling on my face while shaving.  Blades have stayed sharp for the last month and a half (I dry the razor after each use).  The lubrication strip is very nice.  Not sure the flexball does anything though as I haven&#x27;t been compelled to change my shaving technique.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from Gillette, and really wanted to like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave was great! However, it seemed to get a lot duller after every shave and was due for a replacement after the 4 or 5th shave.  Due to the cost of the refills, I think that these should at least be good for a full week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it got duller, it still shaved fine, but wasn&#x27;t spectacular.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch manual razor is a great product. I grew my facial hair out just so I could truly test out how good it would be. No cuts, no ingrown hairs, and no irritation at all. For me that is amazing because of my sensitive skin. This is the first time in a while that I&#x27;m actually fully satisfied with my shave. The only thing I can say is the downside is just the holder for the razor. You can&#x27;t put it on the wall so it&#x27;s really just something to keep it from getting dirty. Other than that it is a fantastic product. The best part about it was that Gillette was nice enough to give me it for FREE. So I am happy they let me try their great product an I am definitely going to be a customer of theirs from here on out.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of using a new type of women&#x27;s razor (not my usual Venus)....I felt like pampering and opted to use this for my legs and underarms and really like the results. I find that men&#x27;s razors work better with gel shaving creams versus old standards like Barbasol and I get a smooth shave without irritation when using this product with a gel. This one didn&#x27;t reach my husband, but as a general rule, Gillette Fusions are a favorite of his.</li>
    <li> This razor is, hands down, one of the best razors to have ever graced my skin. Smooth shave and no irritation&#x3D;winning in my book! The only problems I had was holding on to the razor. As with most men our hands tend to get wet while shaving. The handle became slippery and would slide right out of my fingers. After digging my fingernail into the rubber to keep it from sliding, I was given one if the best shaves of my life. The edging blade, I think saved my beard and the mineral strip kept irritation down. I would have to give the FlexBall ProGlide a 4 out of 5 stars. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty cool. I used the fusion and liked it so changed to the pro glide liked the way it moved around my face with ease. I would recommend it to anyone. And as of right now its a great deal on amazon.com</li>
    <li> I was excited to recieve the razor  iam a bzzagent and recieved it for free through bzzagent I liked the razor it didnt leave razor bumps left my face feeling smooth except the blade was to big and in the tight areas of my face it was hard to shave but other then that I like this razor</li>
    <li> First I am a BzzAgent and received this product free to try. I am a fan if the Gillette Fusion Razors. So I was excited to try the Flexball handle. The handle is compatible to all of the Gillette Fusion razors. And easy to use  The concept is amazon ho it so easy to get all the little spots that are hard to get with most razor  Although it has the Fusion razors the movement of the Flexball keeps the razor from making consistent contact to the skin and easy to use. Which is a disappointment given that the razors are great razors,so you need to buy this and try it your self!!!</li>
    <li> Gotta say, this is a really nice razor.  I got mine free from Gillette, to get me to post this review, and that would usually make me skeptical.  But it came in the mail, I tried it out, and was very pleasantly surprised - close, comfortable, easy to use.  The only two complaints are, first, the lubricating strip on the blade cartridge makes it feel a bit greasy.  I&#x27;ve never liked razors with a lubricating strip; that&#x27;s what the SHAVING CREAM is for!  The other issue is that the replacement blades are $30 a pack, which is close to three times the cost of the razor itself.  I usually use a twin-blade cartridge on a Barbasol brand handle, and I get the carts at the local dollar store.  Does this five-blade razor provide a better shave?  Sure.  Is it 30 times better?  Probably not, but your experience might vary.  I&#x27;m notoriously cheap.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for testing purposes, and he loved it. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t get clogged, no nicks. It seems kind of large and odd-looking to me, but I&#x27;m not the one using it. It&#x27;s surprisingly lightweight for the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;m going to have to order some refills now.</li>
    <li> i have used Gillette razors all my life, they r the best!!!! i used to use the gilette fusion which i love but the flexball technology steps the bar up to a whole new level. gives a super close shave b/c it naturally adjusts to the contour of ur face.u don&#x27;t have to worry about adjusting the angle of ur hand to get all around ur chin w/ this razor.no more feeling ur face after u finished shaving and thinking to urself,&amp;#34; how the hell did i miss that spot?&amp;#34;. buy 1.....ur girl will ty!!!!</li>
    <li> Hello to get a clearer picture of my razor usage I like to shave once every 1-2 days due to very strong stubble growth that goes all they way up to my side burns. My hair is relatively hard so shaving with a good razor head is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I really do like this razor it is nothing revolutionizing but does provide a little extra comfort due to its flexible ball compared to a straight on razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might not do anything much but my guys who shave on a daily basis will notice it is slightly easier to get into those hard to reach spots so this razor is perfect for you if you find that to be one of your problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would rate this razor a straight 8 out of 10 the innovation of the flexball is interesting and does provide some utility and reachability that a straight head can&#x27;t. I would surely get this as my beard is growing in size all the time and hard to reach places become more and more noticeable.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive the new Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology to try out.  I have been a user of the regular Fusion ProGlide Power razor and blades for the past two years, after switching from many years of electric razor use.  I have sensitive skin, and have been prone to razor bumps and ingrown hairs, so I was anxious to see if this new FlexBall technology improved upon my  current Fusion ProGlide Power routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daily routine is simple- I shave in the shower each morning.  The day after the package arrived, I eagerly stepped in the shower with my new razor.  The handle felt great in my hand, nicely balanced.  worked up a good steam and applied my usual lubricant, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide clear gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result?  The razor and blade indeed effortless glided across my skin.  At first I had to reach up and feel whether I had actually shaved any stubble off- it was that smooth.  I think the FlexBall also helped me get a better shave on the trick curved areas such as the chin and parts of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I really missed the power sensation from my usual razor.  For some reason, and I have no idea why, I prefer the sensation and result using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next few days, I alternated the two razors, just to be sure.  It felt like the power version left less irritation for the rest of the day, even though the FlexBall model shaved better on the harder parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict? I just looked and see there is a power version of the FlexBall razor.  Now I have to decide whether to just continue with my current non-FlexBall power model, or spring for the power version with the FlexBall.  I will be listening to what others think, and discussing it with my friends.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a product trial from Gillette.  For the record, I don&#x27;t use a manual razor to do most of my shaving. I use an electric shaver and then use a manual razor to touch up areas that require a closer shave or that the electric razor can&#x27;t quite reach. Anyone who uses Gillette Fusion ProGlide razors should be well aware of the fact that the razor itself is a high quality razor that provides a very smooth shave, so this review really just focuses on the Flexball handle technology. In short, it works very well in terms of being able to position your arm/hand in conjunction with the razor any way that feels comfortable to you. The Flexball allows you to basically shave any part of your face at any angle that you choose. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a game changer, but it certainly is convenient. Overall, if you&#x27;re a person who has a hard time getting maneuvering your razor to shave your face at just the right angle, then I think this razor is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> because this actually gives a good shave on most of the face.  The problem is that even with more blades, nice thin ones in fact, you still have an issue with the contours.  My husband still uses a disposable BIC with a single blade that has a fixed tilted head to get the area that the fusion can&#x27;t because of it&#x27;s flat head.  A bit pricey too</li>
    <li> This razor provides a very close shave and the flexball truly allows the razor to move smoothly over the contours of my face.  I like the results.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey (as are the refills) and I can buy multiple no-name brands at the dollar store for pennies each but those razors don&#x27;t perform very well at all and a bargain isn&#x27;t a bargain if it doesn&#x27;t do the job. The one negative to the Gillette razor is that I find the handle to be a bit slippery when wet. I wish they&#x27;d made it with a more secure grip and had they done so this would be a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> The flex razor is a great razor for any face, especially, if it&#x27;s rugged.  It moves smooth across the cheek bone and neck line.  Little to no irritation.  My facial hair is corse and this razor had no problem getting through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball razor is a must.</li>
    <li> I have a very rough beard and have tried all kinds of razors in my life so far.  By far, this is one of the best that I have used.  It glides easy over my face and leaves a nice smooth shave.  This is just a great razor and I will continue to purchase this for years to come.</li>
    <li> This razor was fun to use, gave a very close shave with no razor burn, and easy to clean out under running water (a problem with most multi-bladed razors.  This razor is fine for face, armpits or legs.  A great addition to the Gillette Family of razors.  No matter what you shave, you will do it with a smile on your face.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a promotion from Gillette.  I was a little skeptical of the FlexBall when I opened it, as all I could envision was the blade sliding sideways a little and slicing my face.  It actually turned out much better than expected.  The side-to-side movement wasn&#x27;t drastic, and I ended up with only a tiny nick - much less than my other razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is excellent, perfect for doing close quarters,  multiple blades.  You can get a lot of shaves out of one blade, if you clean it properly and put it away.  This maneuvers well around the face.  It is ideal for trimming beards, mustaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, this handles beautiful!  It is geared toward better ergonic grips.  Clean it properly, clean it everytime, and you will get good long lasting shaves.  This is precise....Rizzo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bzzagent and I #gotitfree a full size Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology free, from Gillette and using it was truly amazing! This razor literally provides the closest and smoothest shave that I&#x27;ve ever had, hands down! It&#x27;s great because the Flexball handle technology actually responds to your contours to provide the closest possible shave! If you want to feel like a brand new man, just give this Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle razor a try! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Very good, but the swivel is more a novelty than a working part.  I use it for shaving my face and my head, and it actually seems to work a little better on my head.  But it&#x27;s not noticeably better than a Mach 3 Turbo.  Overall it&#x27;s a good manual razor, but not anything ground breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> The Fusion ProGlide Razor with Flexball handle felt great against my skin, I could feel it not slipping when I would go from cheek to neck and the contouring of skin from different elevations made it a smooth shave, a clean one end to end. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusio Proglide With Flexball from Gillette to try and was surprisingly happy with it. I haven&#x27;t used disposable razors in a while because I was getting a better shave from my electrical one. I gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. I had no razor burn and no irritation after shaving.  I really felt that the razor glided much better over the face contours. My only complaint was that it seems to get clogged by shaving cream rather quickly.</li>
    <li> I recently got my hands on a Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle Technology and brought it with me on my trip to a friend&#x27;s wedding. I work from home and sometimes I go a whole week without a shave. However, I wasn&#x27;t going to go to a black tie wedding looking like a caveman. On the day of the wedding, I decided to put the Gillete razor to a test and shave off a 7 day old beard. With any old razor, I would go over and over, back and forth, and in every direction to shave every single hair off my chin. But with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor, I was finding that it took a fraction of the time to get the same result. My problem area is under the chin and around my neck. The Flexball handle allowed the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor to go over every contour of my face with ease and without any nicks or cuts. I also like that there are 5 blades and 1 precision trimmer blade that allows me to shave more in less time. I am very happy with this razor and will be using it regularly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing the way it runs along my face. It gets every curve and every inch on my face and it leaves it amazingly soft and it makes it feel like i was young again with no hair anywhere on my face.</li>
    <li> This razor took the Gillette Fusion I&#x27;ve been using for years and made it even better. It&#x27;s extra smooth and close shave only got better with the contour of the ball they added. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great first shave, smooth and gentle as you&#x27;d expect from other fusion proglide razors, with a twist :D</li>
    <li> Gillette razors are always thought to be top notch and this one definitely proves this to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving this product from Gillette, the first thing I noticed is that the product comes with a nice stand to hold the razor when not in use. Although it&#x27;s plastic, it&#x27;s very sturdy and is great for collecting any dripping water from the razor after rinsing it off or just simply keeping it from touching the surface it&#x27;s resting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the razor itself is very strong and has a nice metal feel to it and was easy to use with its rubber grips for easier handling. The weight of the razor is considerably heavier than disposable plastic razors, but not enough to where it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use. The five bladed tip provided me a VERY close shave with no annoying pulling or snagging of hairs. I honestly didn&#x27;t really use the flex-ball feature of it all too much simply because I was only using it for my face, but the razor has a wide range of motions so you don&#x27;t accidentally cut yourself which I found handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In review, I&#x27;d have to recommend this razor because of its built solid and shaves great. The added five blade design means it will last longer than your casual razor and that combined with the several features it offers such as the sturdy design and the flex-ball means you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth out of this product.</li>
    <li> The control on the flex ball needs improvement it moves to freely. The blades a clean-cut.but u have go back over a couple times for a complete cut do to the movement of the flexball. the packaging is nice but the holder for the shaver has no real purpose. you to be able to hang it on the wall.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. Every manual razor that I have used leaves me with, at the very least, some minor cuts and razor burn. So for the longest time I have used an electric razor made for sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave, but it gets the job done. I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette and was a bit skeptical about Gillette&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;#1for sensitive skin.&amp;#34; I grew out my facial hair for a couple of days and used the razor this morning. This was the first manual razor that didn&#x27;t make me bleed or give me razor burn. And it gave me a much closer shave than my electric razor.  There was still quite a bit of tug and pull as I shaved, but nothing too uncomfortable. It was also a bit difficult to get  real close under my nostrils. So far it&#x27;s a very nice razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about two weeks now and am very happy with it. The shave is very smooth with no nicks at all around the lips and jaw. The shave lasts from morning to night and really feels good the whole time. All I am using is a generic shave cream and am still getting very good results. This razor is really a good one. Even if I skip a day shaving it still gives a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I love the entire line of Gillette Fusion men&#x27;s razor.  They work great, and they last forever.  The flexball version is just as great as the others.  They may be a little more expensive than cheapo razors, but they are long lasting, and I never cut myself with these, whereas other razors look like I tried to shave with a samurai sword :)  I did receive the item for free from Gillette, but have been a long time fan of Gillette Fusion razors, and have even converted my Father in law, who is a bit tight with his money!</li>
    <li> Usually when I shave with a razor I come back with a ton of nicks.  The first time using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball Technology, I only had like two.  The shave was nice and smooth and has a nice feel to it.  I have no real complaints about this product other than the price.  If I hadn&#x27;t have received this for free from Gillette, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t be buying it unless I decided to splurge on a razor (I&#x27;m frugal and I usually use electric razors).  I&#x27;m glad I got the chance to use this thing, though.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide free from BzzAgent to try out.  My package contained one razor and one cartridge.  I really liked how the razor worked on my face.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with the Flexball, but I was very happy with the closeness of the shave.  Unfortunately the refills are very expensive which may keep me from using this razor in the future unless I can find a really good deal.</li>
    <li> I received a Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology razor from Gillette today in the mail and I just shaved with it. This ProGlide has a new feature called the FlexBall Handle, the razor moves side to side and responds to the contours of your face as you use it. The areas of my face that I really noticed this ProGlide Flexball razor exceeding in was right below my ears and my jaw line. It was cool seeing the Flexball contouring my face as I made each pass from the flatter surface under my sideburns past my jaw line below my ears. I noticed that I only had to make 1 pass in these areas that sometimes take 2 or 3. While shaving my chin this razor also only required 1 pass. I was very pleased with the results of the shave. I didn&#x27;t bother shaving against the grain with this razor because when I was done shaving I couldn&#x27;t see any stubble and my skin felt very smooth. Other razors I&#x27;ve used required shaving against the grain which can result in skin irritation or nicks. I had seen this new razor showing up in stores before I used it today, and wondered what the hype was all about. The ProGlide Flexball isn&#x27;t just a new gimick razor, as you use it you&#x27;ll benefit from the closer shave as the razor makes maximum contact over contours getting virtually every hair in a single stroke. I&#x27;ve shaved with Gillette Sensor Excel then moved on to the Mach 3, I&#x27;ll now stick with the ProGlide with Flexball Handle technology as it has proven to me to give Gillette&#x27;s best shave.</li>
    <li> I just got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide and used it the next morning. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it shaved. This razor shaved much closer than my Mach3.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I received it as a sample from Gillette and will be sticking with it. It feels heavy, which give me great control around the contours of my face and neck. I have been using it for three weeks and haven&#x27;t cut myself yet. For this alone, I love it.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I&#x27;m not a man (and it actually irks me a bit that razors are &amp;#34;gendered&amp;#34; because I&#x27;ve been using the 5-Blade Gillette Fusion since the day it came out while my husband prefers the cheapie disposables and neither of us care for the &amp;#34;ladies&amp;#34; selection of blades) but I figured this Flexball option would work great for me because I use it to shave everywhere there&#x27;s hair and there&#x27;s a lot of tiny nooks and crannies that would theoretically benefit from having a responsive, flexible razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Gillette blade is fabulous and does not disappoint, the flexball gimmick really was a dud for me, simply because I could not control when it decided to do it&#x27;s little swooshie thing and shave a different area than the one I had intended.  I found myself going over the same spot numerous times because it would swoosh around a stretch of hair that I had intended to shave and suddenly it was anyone&#x27;s guess where I&#x27;d find stray patches of missed hairs.  It became frustrating on especially sensitive areas where I needed to have precise control and couldn&#x27;t get the razor to cooperate.  In the end, I went back to my old standby and haven&#x27;t looked back.  This will not be the next upgrade for me.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical at first; I mean, who needs a Dyson-vacuum-style razor anyway?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After living with this razor for the last month, I am compelled to relay that I am now a fan of it&#x27;s close shave....so much so, that I have been able to go without using any shaving cream...a little soap, or shampoo suds, and its smooooooth shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In full disclosure, Gillette sent me this razor to try for free...no strings attached via BzzAgent.com; however, I&#x27;ve been so impressed with the product that I couldn&#x27;t keep from writing something.</li>
    <li> Full disclaimer: I received a free product sample directly from Gillette to use and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this razor a shot, and while it does a good job of getting all the hairs, and its mobility around my face is one of the best I&#x27;ve experienced so far, it just isn&#x27;t for me. It still makes a difficult transition for someone used to almost exclusively electric razors. I just don&#x27;t like how these types of razors feel on my face as a whole, and I doubt I can ever get over that. While it isn&#x27;t something i&#x27;d personally get again, I will say that for what it is, any fan of these razors would find it quite well. It gripped comfortably in my hand, the weight felt just right as I held it, and price wise, its pretty affordable.</li>
    <li> Well, it seems like everyday these companies are coming out with newer/better/safer/smoother/fancier razors for keeping yourself well groomed.  After a while, you start to wonder if there really is that big of a difference between 3 blades and 4.  I&#x27;ve been using my razor for quite some time now, and I decided that it was time to try something new.  Luckily for me, Gillette was offering a trial of their new Fusion Proglide Razor.  I received one free razor to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this razor different?  Well, it seems like the main thing is this Flexball Handle.  Basically, the razor pivots side to size so as to help it stay in contact despite the contours of the face.  When opening the package, the first thing I did was play with this feature.  It does rock back and forth pretty smoothly.  While checking out the ball, I noticed that the razor has a good weight to it, and a solid grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the shave:  It was good. Did the Flexball make a huge difference?  Hard to say.  I did notice that each stroke really does take off what it is expected to.  I didn&#x27;t notice any drastic tilting by the head, but perhaps I&#x27;m not supposed to.  I did notice that the shave was smooth.  I didn&#x27;t notice any tugging.  I didn&#x27;t need to redo the same area multiple times. I suppose when it comes to the Flexball, it&#x27;s like Futurama says, &amp;#34;When you&#x27;re doing something right, people won&#x27;t be sure you&#x27;ve done anything at all.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor a few times per week for a couple of weeks now. I use it with some standard shave gel, and generally on slightly longer facial hair. I feel like I&#x27;m pretty qualified to say that this razor does a good job of taking off the hair without causing any problems.  If you want to very visibly see some sweet Flexball action while shaving, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. But if you want a razor that efficiently does what it is supposed to, you&#x27;ll be making a good choice by picking this one.</li>
    <li> I was a fan of the shave but not a fan of the FlexBall. I found myself worried about cutting myself and the movement of the head was distracting. I&#x27;ll stick with the Fusion for now.</li>
    <li> A good razor overall. The flexball is nice and does help make the shaving process easier. That being said, if you already have a Fusion razor I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money to upgrade. The ProGlide Power was much better for my sensitive skin. This razor is definitely good, but not a huge upgrade over the regular Fusion or ProGlide series.</li>
    <li> Excited to try the newest razor by Gillette. I was very happy with the complete job it did. I also liked that it was easy to maneuver around my face and chin. I didn&#x27;t get any cuts or nicks and got a close, clean shave.</li>
    <li> I chose this product to review for Vine because, frankly, I wanted to try one of these men&#x27;s razor to shave my legs.  Guys always have these razors that look like they were designed in some tech whiz&#x27;s lab, while we women get the small-headed, rigid pink razors.  So boring and so easy to nick oneself with them if one doesn&#x27;t have model-thin legs.  If you&#x27;ve got a lot of leg acreage like me, using one of those little pink things takes forever.  Hence my choice to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it.  I liked the movement of the razor head along the curves of my legs, it did a good job without nicks and left smooth skin behind.  It was easy to hold and use.  I don&#x27;t know yet how long the blades will hold their edge, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s a better product than my usual disposable pink razors.</li>
    <li> When I received the Gillette fusion proglide silvertouch to review I was a bit skeptical. I had quit using disposables about a year ago in favor of a safety razor, but I still use Gillette disposables and electric razors for those times when I need a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that this wasn&#x27;t that much different than any other disposable razor. sure the flexball provided a little more movement, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be a dramatic change. However, when is used the proglide flexball the first time i immediately could tell a difference. I was able to shave very quickly, and the flexball really allowed me to get those hard to reach spots around my chin, nose, and under my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving I waited a few hours to write this review. I have very sensitive skin around my neck, and any disposable razor i used before would inevitably cause razor burn. The Gillette Proglide Flexball has so far eliminated any razor burn. I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the flexball allowing me to shave in one pass, or because of the new moisturizer strip on the razor, but whatever it is works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Summary:&lt;br /&gt;The razor provides a close shave on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;The flexball really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be using this on a daily basis, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep it in the medicine cabinet for those times when I&#x27;m in a hurry or traveling.</li>
    <li> Love this razor, super sharp, no pull. definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> After I received this razor from Gillette for FREE and upon my testing.... my review is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every mans face has 1 or 2 tough shaving spots, spots/areas that cause irritation or razor burn if not extremely careful while shaving.  I have used the original fusion proglide manual razor for over a year consistently(2-3 times wk) and my take on the new innovated version with the swivel head is that it takes to these specific areas on my face a lot better.  I enjoyed a smooth shave with little to no irritation.  I give it 4/5 stars as its definitely an improvement and Im sure Gillette will continue to innovate the personal handheld razor to where I can vote 5/5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all it is a very good quality razor and much better for ME then the original Proglide.  I&#x27;m sure you wont be disappointed with this purchase and if you were for any reason I&#x27;m positive the good customer friendly folks at Gillette would make it right with you</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette for free to try and review. I must say this is my new favorite razor. It is very fast and easy for me to shave with because it moves so quickly and safely around  the curves of my face. I was skeptical at first about the ball on the razor because I thought it might swivel a little too much and not be as easy to control as the standard razor. I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts. I have been using this for a couple weeks now and the blades still seem to be just as effective as they were when I got it, which is a nice change from my normal disposables. I also have a much closer shave than with my previous razor. I am very satisfied with it so far, and I may purchase the refills for it rather than going back to my usual three blade disposable. Thank you Gillette!</li>
    <li> I liked the razor. It gave me a smooth and clean shave. I didn&#x27;t honestly notice a difference in having their new Flexball Handle Technology. I would use this as day to day razor, no problem. I got this razor from Gillette for free to try and review. To the point though, I liked the razor; sharp blades, nice premium handle, smooth and comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something new but as far as the Flexball goes...I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in having it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a product test from Gillette (via BzzAgent). This is a completely 100% unbiased review, I promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the headline says - Awesome razor! The ball concept is super cool, which made me excited to try it out. Yes, I was excited about trying the razor before I even opened the package. The razor really does contour to your face when you shave, unlike other razors that simply claim they do. This razor gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. And there was ZERO irritation! I can sometimes have fairly sensitive skin, but you couldn&#x27;t tell it after using the Proglide to shave. No blotches, no irritation, no \\&quot;bumps\\&quot;. Also, no nicks, which is always a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra precision trimmer is nice, too. It&#x27;s skinny enough to get that irritating spot just under my nose and it still shaved smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only future drawback I see with this razor is the price of the refills. I haven&#x27;t mustered up the courage to check the price yet, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re pricey (as are every other razor cartridge on the market...). The blade seems like it will last a while, though. I&#x27;ve been using it for over two weeks and it&#x27;s still just as sharp as the day I took it out of the box.</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Mach III for many years and was ok with its performance. When I used the Gillette Fusion Proglide I received from Gillette, I was blown away by the difference in performance. It was a much smoother and closer shave. I was so impressed that I decided to try shaving with only hot water to see how that would be. Again, I was stunned with how it performed even without the aid of shaving gel. No nicks, cuts or scrapes, just a smooth shave. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Gillete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Gillette brand  of razors for the last 5 years. By far, the Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball is the closest shave I have gotten with the Gillete brand. I usually shave every other day, but now I feel I can go every two days without shaving.</li>
    <li> When i received my Gillette Fusion Proglide with FlexBall in the mail from Gillette I was intrigued. It had all the would be necessities to be a very unique but damn good razor. I have tried it for a few weeks and have been impressed with how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully when i had heard about it i was fully expecting it to come with a rolling ball not unlike a certain brand of vacuum cleaner. Its not quite like that, and i was a bit disappointed, but otherwise it works very similarly to one.  I think if it was an actual a ball it would follow the contours even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using it in the future and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product. The CLOSEST Shave you can ever get with no burns, scratches etc. AWESOME !!!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion is safe and smooth. Best razor on the market. I ordered three for all our family needs.</li>
    <li> What a great Razor, such a close shave now compared to the other manufacturers out there.  This razor was apart of a promotion I got through Gillette and such a great product.  I would HIGHLY recommend this to EVERYONE!!!</li>
    <li> This fusion was one of the best razor&#x27;s that I have shaved with. The razor cut closer and left me with a cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the new Proglide  3 times and I absolutely love it! Very smooth on the contours of my face and cuts the hair nice and close. Definitely recommended for those with sensitivity issues as well. Did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have migrated to an electric razor, but I had the opportunity to test the new Fusion Flexball razor.  I have to say it surpassed all my expectations.  I had just started to grow out my beard, but once I gave this razor a chance, I embraced it. It cut smoothly and without issue.  Also, the replaceable blade has lasted several weeks now.  It very easily adjusts and glides over my jawline, chin and neck.  It has remained sharp and the flexball design is strong.  I have found my razor for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Received the razor two weeks ago and have been using it every other day. Very happy with the results, the blades that come with the razor itself always seem to be better than the replacement blades! The ball works well, but the ads they show on men making funny faces to get certain areas is amusing as the ball really doesn&#x27;t help much for the area right under the nose, so faces are still made. Hoping the razor continues to work just as well as it is!</li>
    <li> After the first use I was ready to write a bad review.  The handle kept slipping in my hand when wet and was very inconvenient and cumbersome.  But did keep using it and seemed to get better and held firm in my hand.  It does a nice job of rotating and avoiding nicks...but in doing so, did not shave as close...could not give as much pressure to make close.  Think I may go back to my Mach 3.  When I use it I only have to shave every 3rd day.  With the Proglide I was shaving every other day at least.</li>
    <li> I first want to say i&#x27;m not a huge fan on just plain old razors,I like the ones that have the vibrating motor I just seem to get better results with those than a traditional razor. Now with that being said,Gillette provided me a Free Proglide razor to try,This razer did not only look cool it preformed about 20-30 times better than the razors I was using with the little motor in them. The Pivot action this razor has is simply amazing,It conforms to my face so easy,I can get from my neck to my side burns all in one swipe. Any one looking at this razer should definitely try it,It could be the last razor you buy.</li>
    <li> One of the best, closest shaves that I have ever had! I have not gotten cut or nicked once and it leaves my face smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom! Really if i had to complain i just wish the cartridges for this specific model were easier to find at a store, but Amazon kinda fixes that issue! I will definatly be purchasing this razors&#x27; refills over and over again!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology provided a close shave. The flexball really helped with shaving down the cheeks and past the jawline. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has a neck beard.</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion razor line for a few years now and have always liked their design and precision. I received a free SilverTouch razor from Gillette the other day and have been very satisfied by the results. This new line is even better than the last as it contours much better then the latter. The only flaw that I see with this razor, along with the others before it is the release button for the razor itself. The location of the button is placed right where I naturally place my index finger causing it to release on accident at times while I shave. Besides this I think that the razor is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an accurate and precise tool.</li>
    <li> My first impressions of this Gillette razor was, &amp;#34;big whoop.&amp;#34; I received it right on time for the next shave in my cycle but it was disappointing to use compared to my cheaper wholesale brand of razors. The Fusion Proglide was tugging on my facial hair and it was missing the &amp;#34;hard-to-reach&amp;#34; places under the chin. I found such experience to be strange because I&#x27;ve owned a previous generation Gillette Fusion razor and it performed exceptionally well so I decided to try again.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I mention my initial experience with this razor is because I&#x27;m not sure if it has to be broken in before it works properly but after my initial shave, the rest were as promised. The razor glides along the face with no interruption in between. The only real complaint I have about this razor is that it doesn&#x27;t reach EVERYTHING - most, but not all. It still misses some hair under my chin but I&#x27;m fine with that because its hardly noticeable. I remember noticing a 5-foot ad for the Gillette Fusion Proglide walking out of a Rite Aid store and thought &amp;#34;wow, that looks like it works,&amp;#34; and boy was I right. Thanks for sending me one Gillette</li>
    <li> This is zakukillerz I am a bzzagent. I received one of the Fusion Proglides by Gillette.  I have been a fan of Gillette for many years all the way back to my military years in the 80&#x27;s so you can imagine I have gone through my share of razors. I have to say I was a little wary about the ball with the little spring on it. Well Gillette did it again. I had planned on buying one but when I was picked to try one out that was even better. The razor with its five blades does a one stroke job, however I do double shaving just like the shave shops so it takes a little longer. The swivel and flex action are great. It makes shaving alot easier in tight spots. One of the draw backs is it does not have a single blade on top for outlining. It has done an awesome job at shaving, however the reason I give it four stars is that Gillette makes such an excellent razor that my wife runs off with it for her use, then thats it no more razor. Well can&#x27;t say to much more great things about the Gillette Fusion Proglide it might get a complex.  Bzz out.</li>
    <li> Typically I shave at night to give my skin a chance to &#x27;settle down&#x27; before I go to work in the morning - with this razor I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor! I received a sample Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from Gillette a couple of weeks ago. This is a smooth razor that does not irritate my face. I would highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> One of the best razors i have used over the last 30 years.  I have tried cheap ones and good ones, they are all a bit less than this one.  I have tried multiple blades, and even the mail-order ones, and this so far has beat then for quality.</li>
    <li> I love my Gillette Fusion razors. They cut nice, smooth, and very close without leaving a burning sensation afterwards. With the new Flexball Handle Technology, it allows the razor to flex around the slightest curved areas without leaving gaps that need to be shaved twice. I will definitely be buying this one in the future. If they had the Flexball handle in the Power edition, that would be the perfect fit.</li>
    <li> My husband got this great razor from Gillette to try.  The blades have held up for multiple shaves. It pivots around the curves of your face effortlessly and gave him a close shave with fewer passes over his face. He said there was no tugging, nicks, or irritation. Over all a Great razor!  Now replacement blade cost is high, just like all razors.  It&#x27;s cheaper to just by another razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette and loved it right out of the box. Worked great, was comfortable and gave a nice clean shave. I was a little disappointed how the lubricated strip dried up so quickly but other than that, I was happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Did the other 371 reviews actually use this razor? The pivoting ball does nothing, it&#x27;s an absolute gimmick. My husband cussed the entire time and threw it away, it tore his face up, bleeding, it pulled his skin and the ball only got in the way because it only goes side to side. What is that ball suppose to do? Even if you have problems turning your wrist don&#x27;t get this razor because it won&#x27;t help and only tear your face up. And after going through all the torture it wasn&#x27;t even a close shave! The second blade must have been dull. His said his whiskers bunched up in it and it was a very rough and torturous shave. He threw it away and went back to just the regular Gillette fusion which he loves.</li>
    <li> Gillette fusion Proglide is a excellent razor it leaves your face smooth and no nicks</li>
    <li> My husband tried this razor and he has really sensitive skin, it gave him a smooth close shave and no razor rash or bumps.</li>
    <li> Just received this a few hours ago From Gillette and since I din&#x27;t bother to shave this week I thought it might be a good test for this razor.  I usually use a combination of Electric trimmer and disposable razors if I have not shaved for a week the trimmer cuts the beard down so the disposable can shave the rest off without becoming clogged.  The Gillette went right through my beard, no pulling and because the blades seem to be fairly far apart they didn&#x27;t clog up at all. I just use regular shave cream and the razor did the job.  No nicks, no cuts, No issues at all.  Depending on how expensive the replacement blades are I have an new shaving system I highly recommend.  Good job Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette.  This might have been one of the closest shaves I have ever had.  I have very sensitive skin and usually get razor bumps from the razor tearing my neck skin.  This time I did not and it was great.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin and who likes a close shave.</li>
    <li> While this was my first time using a manual razor, I had a pretty good experience. The razor left me clean and smooth without any irritation. I&#x27;m not sure if the rotating head was revolutionary but it worked. So if you&#x27;ve had troubles with fitting the corners of your shave I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The fusion proglide line is by far the best razor Ive ever used. I only use razors to shave my head but i do not doubt that i would experience the same comfort on my face. I couldnt distinguish a difference between the original fusion proglide and the the one i received with flexball technology. There were instances were i felt the razor did not line up to my preference with a stroke or two but overall i have no major complaints</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this razor.  Expected the flexball to be some gimmicky marketing bs, turns out it really works well.  Keeps the blade in contact without excess force. This means I can shave safely yet effectively even when still half asleep.  Starting a blade subscription shortly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already reviewed the ProGlide with Flexball in general. My thoughts on that apply to this product as well, with this addition: The vibration is useless. I know it&#x27;s been a thing for a few years now, but I really, really don&#x27;t get it.  It&#x27;s supposed to make the hairs stand up and cut them even closer to the skin? Because after my first shave with the vibrating razor I felt no difference in that area from my first shave with the regular razor. Also, after a while the vibration rendered both my face and my hand slightly numb. I worry that that will increase the risk of cutting myself. What a great feature! So four stars for the flexball design (well, three and a half maybe, once we factor in the limitations imposed by a not-too-impressive cartridge) and a penalty tacked on for employing a stupid, unnecessary, counterproductive gimmick.</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion Proglide since it came out and Ive been happy with it. I shave my head as well as my face and unless I shaved in front of a mirror I would usually find some area that I had to touch up. Especially on the head it seems like I could miss a strip of hair. I think the blade just doesn&#x27;t make enough contact with the head to hit everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started this razor shaving in the same way as always (without mirror). I didn&#x27;t really feel much difference but I did notice that I would have to do less touch-ups and there weren&#x27;t the same trouble spots that I would routinely miss with the fusion. I really think, the movement the handle allows the blades is the difference so the handle is worth the cost of this single pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade however is the money maker for Gillette everyone knows that. The nice thing about this is I got a greatly improved handle but it uses the same replacement blades I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really would suggest this as an upgrade if you  already use the Fusion Proglide with the regular handle. That extra side to side movement seems to make a difference in allowing the blade to track better on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS....There are some great tips on greatly increasing the time you get before you have to change the blade. I saw these tips on a review for the fusion blades and they work with the proglide blades so look at them and save yourself some money.

    <li> The gillete fusion proglide send from gillete gives you better shaving by addapting to your contour it is a good pruct that i will continue to use</li>
    <li> The first thing I liked about the Fusion ProGlide, that Gillette sent me to try, was the heavy handle. I wanted to feel something in my hand. I didn&#x27;t want a dainty plastic razor like my wife uses. I like to think of my razors as a tool, not a toy. I lathered up my three day old scruff and shaved away. The razor shaved smooth, no cuts, and absolutely no hair left. I did take it easy though because my face has been known to break out pretty bad if I don&#x27;t take my time. Two days later, no bumps, no redness, and only a small stubble. So far so good. The only thing I was not impressed with was the \\&quot;ball joint.\\&quot; I do not think it makes any different if it was there or not. Indeed it went over my chin like a pro, but that was really the only place I even noticed the \\&quot;ball joint.\\&quot; The only other con is that the refill cartridges are very expensive. Other than that, the Fusion ProGlide is a awesome razor with the power to shave my rough exterior.</li>
    <li> I am a Bzzagent as well and received the product from Gillette and really enjoy using it. This flexball shaver is the best shaver I have used in a long time I highly recommend getting it. I have a sensitive face and this shaver doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all and gets all of the hard to reach hairs.</li>
    <li> I recently received this from Gillette to try out, i was pleasantly surprised on the outcome. To begin with i&#x27;ve used Progilide(non-flexball) and it does a good job but wasn&#x27;t worth the cost compared to Dorco products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying out this new Prolide with flex-ball i think ill be switching back to Prolide i really love the swivel and the areas it can reach my face without having to do much maneuvering</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. It gives a nice clean shave!! I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> This razor is a definite improvement over older models. Scraps the contours of my face with minimal effort. I shave in the shower and now have no need to double check in the mirror after I am done. Great product. Only disadvantage is the claim that these blades last a month each. I give them a week if I&#x27;m feeling lazy.</li>
    <li> First of all,for durability this blade is a 1st choice!Still using the the blade that came with the set and it still cuts like it just out of the box.Gillette Fusion Proglide does exactly as advertised.It conquer that dreaded around the underside of the neck to the jaw and around the chin.I must admit I had my reservations  about a pivoting razor.Wound it have enough stability to cut properly? Well the answer is yes!After 30 days my shaves are smooth and no nick or missed spots on my face.The Proglide also has a comfortable fee land the ball motion is is well designed and has a quality  feel to it.To me also cleaning the blades was easy and rinsed off well.Fellows,don&#x27;t always blame your razor for gunking up,check you shaving gel or cream.I tried both a gel and cream and both cleaned right of with a warm water rinse with the Gillette ProGlide.Overall I would recommend the Gillette ProGlide as a first choice if buying a razor if your a long time shaver like me or just starting out because it meets all the demands of shaving a man needs to to get a close clean shave.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. The Flexball allows to get an unbelievably close shave. I was sick and didn&#x27;t shave for a week and I didn&#x27;t to hack away at my face like you do with other razors. I recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> The razor works great. The blades are very sharp and cut hair but not skin even using soap as a shaving cream (as I do). The blades are replaceable by other Gillette blades that I had lying around which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, this is a razor.  Any man that has been shaving for years, uses the same technique to shave, in roughly the same pattern each time.  You make the faces, and go about your business.  Honestly, the razor is nice but I don&#x27;t think the pivot point ball adds much to the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly continue to use this product through its useful life, but I am yet unsure if I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best razor I have ever used.  Smooth to the touch and glides across the face with ease.  Im hooked.</li>
    <li> I have used a Gillette Mach 3 turbo for nearly a decade and I decided to take the plunge and try the new razor. The rotating ball definitely helps keep the razor flat to my face with the different angles the ball allows for. The 5 blades work well and cut my hair pretty good and the trimming blade on the back is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not a bad razor it definitely leaves me with a clean shaven face. But It&#x27;s not noticeably better than my older Mach 3. The blades don&#x27;t last as long and are more expensive.</li>
    <li> Gillette fusion flexball disposable razor system is a great I had no problems with the razor I really enjoyed how well it shave without going back over to reshave.</li>
    <li> This razor is my all time favorite out of any razor I have ever used. It shaves close and makes my face feel so much smoother than other razors. It&#x27;s also easier to use with the swivel pivot in it, makes it so much easier to shave, gets into every curve on my face. I will definitely be buying refills for this razor! This razor is AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product from  Gillette and I love this razor!!! I wish I had it when I was in the army, I wouldn&#x27;t have had to do as many push ups because it gets that 5pm shadow lol!!!!</li>
    <li> This razor is the last razor I will ever buy. Smooth and quick. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the packaging is the coolest I have seen. Very innovative.</li>
    <li> I just got the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide and used it for the first time.  I have been a long time user of Gilette razors and I have to say that this is the best razor they have produced.  It has certainly made shaving easier and more comfortable.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Got this new razor free from bzzagent and I love the way it glides accross my face and swivels around the curves of my face without knicking work well with Gillette shaving cream and with the many blades it cuts down on the razor bumps and irritation would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to handle this Razor, the extra blades definitely help. However, in terms of closeness of the shave it remains same as my previous Gilette</li>
    <li> i finally found a razor that lives me feeling great and does not live me irritated its gives me just what i need a smooth shaving living my skin feeling like babys skin..wants you try it you will love it</li>
    <li> Have been using the Proglide for several weeks and was at first intimidated by the 5 blades. Not to worry as I have still not cut myself and am getting the closest shave of my life. I&#x27;m over 60 so face not as smooth as when I was 20. The one blade on reverse side is great for trimming anything.</li>
    <li> I just received  a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology razor from the company to try and..  it is the best razor I have tried in many years!It glides over every angle of your face with ease..cuts super clean,no worries about any misses or those terrible bumps!This is a razor you will love to use and be so glad you did!Thank you!</li>
    <li> I received a sample razor from Gillette and am very thankful for it. I have always felt that Gillette razors stand up and last longer than other brands. I am still using the same razor head 3 weeks later, while many times the blades are dull after a week. This razor does turn and flex better than most, however it is still just as important to know the direction to shave your face to avoid razor burns and get as close as possible, this will help that. The only negative comment I have about this razor is the trimming blade on the back. It&#x27;s embarrassing, but I cut my nose pretty good with it my first time using it, as I did not notice it.</li>
    <li> Good razor but not the best... it gets the job done.  It gets the job done but I felt I had to make several passes to get that real smooth feeling which is more than I&#x27;m used to.  The flexball isn&#x27;t really a ball but a round shaped plastic cap sitting on a metal strip that gives it that swivel/ball action but I feel it hinders the shaving experience more than helps it.</li>
    <li> I went from two blades disposable razor to a 5 blades Pro Glide.  6 blades if you count the trimming blade.  It was quite a difference in comfort vs the two blades I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I liked the feel of the handle in my hand made for a good grip.  The gel pad added to the comfort.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the shaving head gave me the go ahead to speed up my shaving time with no nicks.  The pivots work well not matter which way I try to go around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks, the gel pad is gone.  The blades are still cutting semi well enough, but time to start looking for blades.&lt;br /&gt;That is when I decided to go back to disposables.  Refills are going for 3.50 to 4.00 each.  I’m just too frugal to pay that.  Twin blade disposables with a lubricated strip are going for .19 cents each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend for someone who wants total comfort.</li>
    <li> Meh, tried this product and to be honest the 2 blade cartridge from dollar shave club does better. Granted this razor does contour better if you don&#x27;t adjust your angle of your grip, but some basic knowledge of how to properly shave and adjust to the contours of your face you can achieve the same effect.</li>
    <li> This razor is one of the best I tried so far. Nice close shave...no stuble....smooth ...I used it on my legs and arms....you only have to go over an area only one time. Quickest shave ever. Smooths legs last longer than other razore. I would def recomend.</li>
    <li> THE  BEST!!!  I received this razor from Gillette to try for free and it\\&quot;s a major improvement over the original pro glide. No missed spots or multiple passes on my face needed. It has excellent contact with my round shaped face, getting all the hair off on  the first pass. No more hair bumps or snaggs on this baby face. Thanks Gillette.........</li>
    <li> Received this from Gillette for review.  Love the Flexball technology.  Glides smoothly with no nicks on the skin.  Would recommend this product for a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> The Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle gives a great shave.  Nicely curved handle is comfortable at all angles.  I have to shave my entire head since I lost my hair years ago.  Does a smooth job without cuts and nics, leaving a silky feel to the skin without razor rash.  While its a great razor, I don&#x27;t think its anything spectacular.  It does hold its own in a large market.</li>
    <li> I received my Flexball Silvertouch as a promotional offer by the company. I expected this razor to be about as gimmicky as a powered Fusion ProGlide and was half right. While I certainly noticed less tugging and nicks around the jawline, I don&#x27;t feel like the shave was any better than the plain Fusion ProGlide. I&#x27;ll stick with the Gillette brand but won&#x27;t go out of my way to replace this Flexball Sivertouch whenever it breaks down.</li>
    <li> I thought this razor was great, i received a free sample from Gillette, and both my boyfriend and I thought the swivel ball helped a great deal in preventing cuts and razor burn.</li>
    <li> Having just used this razor for the 5th time i figured I could post a review :) I&#x27;ve always been skeptical towards the rising number of blades put on our razors now, back in highschool (2006) most razors came in bundles of 10 with 2 blades &amp; I felt it was fine.  Eventually I decided it was time to use a razor that would last more than a shave &amp; a half &amp; due to a very nice sale i picked up a schick hydro 5...    Now i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, only managed to cut myself WHEN i used shave gel or cream...1st shave with that 5 blade beast had my face so irritated &amp; full of tissue pieces I felt my stance against excessive amounts of blades justified.  A friend of mine not long ago mentioned this fusion proglide with a swivel design for a close, comfortable shave that would \\&quot;literally glide across the contours of your face\\&quot; (interesting taste in friends, i know xp) lucky enough for me Gillette sent me a free one to try &amp; honestly...it&#x27;s proven to be the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with a standard razor! I didn&#x27;t really notice much difference with the flexball at first, but once I decided to shave as smooth &amp; close as possible for a performance &amp; shaved up i noticed i didn&#x27;t have to be so careful going from neck to sideburn. No cuts on my face whatsoever from first shave to now &amp; i honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price on the refills on this product as well, hopefully they don&#x27;t comeout with a new razor &amp; decide to no longer make these refills...at least for a looong time :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor from BzzAgent and I loved it!  Amazing razor w/ precise closeness.  If you need to try a new razor this is the one for you!  The swivel ball allows for easy as well as comfort. Love Gillette!</li>
    <li> You had not shave you if you did not use it... it is amazing the comfort</li>
    <li> This razor has almost been god sent. The best razor u had by far it dint leave red bumps on my skin or cause allergies.  I have very sensitive skin and this work perfectly. I had the closest shave I had in years left my skin felt pre puberty.  Amazing razor and I usually never leave reviews.</li>
    <li> I was able to test this product that I got for free from Gillette. I feel that this is a great shaver that gets everywhere you need it to. It&#x27;s comfortable so you don&#x27;t cut yourself. It also shaves really good and gets every hair. My only negative is that it clumps easily so I clean it more often then usual, although it could he because of my coarse hair. Otherwise I would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product thanks to a free trial from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a big fan of Gillette, but with so many products its hard to find one that truly delivers.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch definetly delivers! The best feature has got to be the low cutting blades, and the ability to reach every corner and edge of my face without cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great long lasting shave.</li>
    <li> There is nothing I (or my husband) found wrong about this razor, but at the same time, nothing jumped out about it to suggest it should now become the standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt substantial, and the ball mechanism allowed various contours to be followed, but not in a way that produced a noticeably better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider buying this, but wouldn&#x27;t seek it out specifically.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, gives me a really good even shave. after the first shave I immediately it amazon to buy refills, I see myself using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from the manufacturer recently, and was asked to try it out and then post the results in the form of a review. Though I have not reviewed a product of any type in quite some time,  I feel that I&#x27;m a good choice as a test subject here for one simple reason: I rarely seem to find the time to shave, and thus go for long stretches between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am a full-fledged member of the workforce rat-race, complete with long, difficult hours and ridiculous commute. It seems that I&#x27;m rushed by something or someone 24/7/365, and rarely seem to have time for anything anymore. Alas, shaving currently takes a backseat to working, parenting and general survival. I&#x27;m somewhat fortunate however, in that I work 2nd shift in a shipping department, and really lack the need to impress anyone with my appearance. Therefore, I often go as much as 2 weeks between shaves -- at which time the itchiness and unfrozen caveman appearance send me scrambling begrudgingly back to the ol&#x27; sink &amp; mirror for the ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Shaving in the shower is out, since I do still like to carve out my medium chops and goatee from underneath it all, and do not possess one of your fancy fog-free mirrors in that location. Electrics are out, as I have yet to find one that can properly &amp; completely shave my face --even under ideal (daily shave) circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have now used the ::deep breath:: Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology ::gasp:: on four occasions. The most important criteria for me right off the bat would be the clog factor, for obvious reasons. I have a moderately heavy beard, and 1-2 weeks of growth provides a serious challenge in this regard. Most multi-blade razors I&#x27;ve used in the past have required a complex and vigorous process of repeated slapping, swishing and tapping in order to fully clear the blades of the hoarded, dense whisker detritus. Today&#x27;s subject most definitely impressed me here, and was easily cleared out between strokes with a single swish, tap, or slap, but rarely required any combination of such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In short, this razor gives an excellent overall shaving experience, and the pivoting, flexing action really does provide a smooth &amp; comfortable shave, with good control. The grip is ergonomically sound, and the assembly has the right amount of heft &amp; balance. I have also given this razor a try with just 2-3 days between shaves, and the whole process took just a few quick &amp; easy minutes once the face was prepped. Though the blades are still quite sharp and efficient after these uses, I am now left with a simply wonderful razor... that will eventually need some refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And therein lies the problem with so many of today&#x27;s refillables: the rising and often prohibitive cost of blades. Even with all the hours of work, times are still tough; and until I can find a way around this working-class-person-on-a tight-budget obstacle, I will probably continue to go back to swishing &amp; slapping the stiff yet trusty old Wilkinson triple and its comparatively affordable refill blades.een strokes with a single swish, tap, or slap, but rarely required any combination of such.

    <li> I was sent this razor by Gillette to test it.  I&#x27;ve been using a Sensor Excel for as long as I can remember and was happy with it, but the handle was so old, that the disposable razor cartridges were falling off.  I have been looking for a replacement for a little while when I got this.  Now, I&#x27;m a shower shaver, with a goatee and brave (I don&#x27;t use a mirror).  This razor flowed across my skin, and didn&#x27;t leave any areas where it left some stubble where I had shaved.  The 5 blades mean the shave you get is thorough.  I always felt in control of where on my face the blade head was - despite it&#x27;s size and movement - it was a manageable shaving tool.  The ball works like it says it does - keeping contact with your facing, so you reach every space you cross.  Plus, my skin felt smooth when done, not at all irritated.  I&#x27;ve thrown out the old Sensor and moved onto this!</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this razor to try and review. So here is my honest opinion. I&#x27;ve been testing it for a couple of weeks now and I must say that I really like the way it shaves and how close. I have very sensitive skin and this razor doesn&#x27;t aggravated as much as other razors do so this is a bonus for me considering I don&#x27;t have to suffer too much for shaving. The pivoting head or ball works great and makes shaving so much easier. I think Gillette is a great company that always evolves and that brings us the latest innovations in their products. So I would recommend this product and brand to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had received this razor from Gillette to try and give my feedback. I used this razor for 8 shaves before writing this review. My first thoughts were &amp;#34;sweet this idea looks like it would really work to get a better shave&amp;#34;, boy was I disappointed. The quality of the shave was clean, smooth and sharp around the edges ,just what I expected from a Gillette Fusion razor, but to be honest almost no difference from their non roller ball edition. Same amount of strokes and movements I do with the standard one and the swivel action did not work as well as seen on TV. I was a little dumbfounded on how this was better. After the third shave I had figured out that this razor is not meant for everyone. Confused, let me tell you a little about my self to help clear things up. I am 23 years old, 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; and weight about 205 pounds so my face has a little roundness to it. I have been shaving since I was 15 and learned to do a motion to best fit my face. So for 8 years I have been following the contours of my face every single week, lifting my face, pulling on my neck and turning my wrist to get those curves. ( see where I&#x27;am going with this?) It had dawned on me, this razor was designed to swivel the the contours of your face ( with the right motion ). So I tried again in a few days with a different motion with success on getting the head to swivel.  The shave was a little closer and cleaner I think which is why I gave it 3 stars. The downside is breaking a 8 year habit of shaving a certain way to get only a little better shave. To me this just was not worth it and I continued to use the razor like I have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let this discourage you!&lt;br /&gt;Every man has their own way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it all up&lt;br /&gt;The design of the razor was great&lt;br /&gt;Was this razor for me-No&lt;br /&gt;Did it give a better shave- A little&lt;br /&gt;Is this razor for you- You wont know till you try&lt;br /&gt;This razor seems like it would work better for someone with a move defined faceline&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to a friend- I have and he loves it&lt;br /&gt;Improvements? A little more swivel</li>
    <li> I recently received this product from Gillette, and found it to be extremely smooth and it doesn&#x27;t nick. The Flexball  handle helps to shave those hard to reach areas on my face. This an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone. It is absolutely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00J2APS60 Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology With 1 Razor Blade]]  I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual razor for free from Gillette to try.  Overall, I must admit that it gives an all-around solid shave.  The attractive silver handle is heavy and fit comfortably in my hand.  The razor gave me a close comfortable shave, especially down around the jawbone.  The flexible head does make it a little difficult to maintain a solid line around my beard, but overall, I would have no reservations purchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Gillette. You know two things. It&#x27;s going to be a good close shave as long as blades are new and the replacement blades are going to cost you. Wish it came with more than one blade</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave, there is nothing like it. I shave every day and it&#x27;s a close shave.</li>
    <li> i got this razor from gillette to test, i like the razor leaves your skin feeling smooth and its very easy to use, the blade stays sharp for a long time i&#x27;ve used the same blade for a couple of week and its still works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this second one because I travel so much.  Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. The shave is very close and I love the cutting surface when you turn it over and shave under your nose.  Great feature.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend. He love this product. He usually used the old school safety razor and this work out great. A quick shaving on a tight budget.</li>
    <li> I got a test unit from Gillette and boy was it nice. I have been a Gillette fan since I started shaving but this really brings it to the next level. You get the same nice weight as previous models but instead of just rotating in one direction, the blade can pivot to match your facial contour. It gave a very comfortable shave with no nicks. I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> No doubt, the Fusion Proglide is a great razor. But looking at the price of refills ($30 for 8?), it&#x27;s frankly not that much better than, say, my more affordable Sensor. Yes, it&#x27;s got 5 blades, but I think we&#x27;re now getting into the territory of that old Saturday Night Live sketch on the subject. It seemed absurd at the time, it seems absurd now. Great shave, but I just don&#x27;t see the long-term value unless it had the ability to let me skip a day (it doesn&#x27;t, and neither does my beard).</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have used many brands of razors. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with new Flexball handle technology is by far the best razor that I have ever used. This razor gave me the closest shave with absolutely no skin irritation. I have also found that the blades on this razor last longer than the blades on other razors that I have used in the past. I received this razor free from Gillette so that I could use it and write a review. I absolutely love everything about this razor. There is nothing that I dislike. This razor will be the only one that I will use. I also highly recommend this razor to everyone. Try it. You definitely will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> the handle is sort of thin for my taste.... I prefer their wider handled razors...however, this one has a swivel head... not really sure its of much benefit...</li>
    <li> I got a free sample from Gillette    Packaging: The packaging pleases aesthetically, the guitar shape cutout is especially cool.  It required no tools to open and caused very little frustration.  I did start in the wrong place, so as you can see in the picture I separated the cardboard from the plastic at the glue joint rather than tearing the perforations on left side (middle in the picture).  It is important to start and pull downward at the very top tab with the small down pointing arrow as the perforations are surprisingly a little hard to tear (making them finer might be warranted).  A small set of picture instructions on the back for how to open would have helped.    Initial Shave: Having been a dedicated electric razor user all my life, I was pleased at how easy to use this razor was.  I got a truly \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; shave with hardly any irritation.    Longevity:  While I can expect a lot of variability in how long a blade should last, I got about 2 weeks use before I could sense it getting duller and started to irritate my face. That&#x27;s less than half the \\&quot;up to 5 weeks\\&quot; claimed by Gillette in their commercials:    [...]</li>
    <li> I received this product from Gillette as a free trial, and I certainly had no reason not to test it out on my face. I&#x27;ve always had a great impression of the Gillette brand, and that impression is certainly maintained with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, after using this new razor twice now, I have to say I don&#x27;t really feel like this razor is a huge improvement over any other razor I&#x27;ve used before, from Gillette or other manufacturers. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s any worse either. Just about the same. I don&#x27;t really think that any of the &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; made to the technology in this razor really helped me out. My face is just as cleanly shaven as it was last week before I tried the new proglide razor with flexball handle technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, thank you for the free trial. My face is definitely well shaved. But, I don&#x27;t think I will go out of my way to buy this product in the future. I suppose it depends on how much it costs.</li>
    <li> This is The Best Razor my face has EVER Met! It glides, pivots &amp; WORKS!!! I was lucky enough to have been chosen to test it for free! Thanks Gillette! The Best A Man Can Get!  It&#x27;s WONDERFUL &amp; My Wifey agrees!!!</li>
    <li> better than previous version of Gillette. I love to use it.</li>
    <li> The razor is nicely goes around the edges of your face with the help of the ball design that is also used in dyson vacuums. It comes with a nice little holder too that is sturdy and keeps the razor safe when not used. Pretty simply product which means it&#x27;s a simple buy if you are in need of a new razor</li>
    <li> Shaving I find, is never made easier by any gimmick that is added to a razor. Vibration, swivel, etc. Everyones face is different and I still need to wet my face with a hot towel every time. As well I always need to take care to get hairs that grow stubbornly in an odd direction. No extra feature has ever made the process easier. This is a good razor like many others. Swivel is neither here nor there, at least for my face. Maybe if your hair all grew in a very uniform way it might help. Mine does not. I also think razors and cream in general are way overpriced. I will try and use a razor as long as I can to save money.</li>
    <li> My husband is the ultimate cheapskate - he always looks for coupons for razors and tries to save money whenever he can. We got this razor to review and let me tell you - his cheapskate ways have disappeared...at least when it comes to this razor. This is the first time he&#x27;s ever reviewed an expensive razor and has then gone out to purchase blade heads because he loved the product so much! This is what he said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The swivel action works beautifully and it goes right across your face like it&#x27;s not even cutting. But it definitely is. The blades are extremely easy to clean and I can even shave my face without having to use shaving cream and don&#x27;t have to deal with razor burn. I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and will continue to use it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual razor for three weeks now and the results have been reliable. The brand Gillette is synonymous with a great shave. My first razor in high school was a Gillette and I have been a loyal user since then. To give some background, I have a tough, thick beard that grows back fairly quickly. I work in an industry where it is important to maintain a clean-cut look. I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual handle and cartridge through a program sponsored by Gillette. The ProGlide SilverTouch has features similar to my ProGlide Power except for one new feature – FlexBall Technology. The flexball is supposed to enable the blades to pivot back and side to side to respond to the contours of the face. It reminds of the ball feature in most new vacuum cleaners today that enhance maneuverability. Gillette is currently running a rather simple yet memorable advertising campaign that highlights the benefits of this new feature, particularly above the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the flexball to be effective in responding to the contours of my face while staying close to the skin. In particular, it was more effective below my nose and along my jawline, which is area where I often have missed hairs. The ergonomic design of the handle made it easy to grip. The microcomb lifted the hairs up and guide them in a uniform direction for a closer cut. The lubristrip allowed for smooth strokes and as a result, the razor was gliding effortlessly. The mineral oil from the lubristrips also left my skin feeling soft and irritation-free. The power of 5 blades meant that I did not have to repeat my strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the razor under multiple conditions over the past three weeks: 1 day shave, 3 day shave, and 1 week shave. In each situation, the result was a smooth, close shave. With the 1 day shave, where I had limitedhair regrowth, I did experience a few nicks below the nose but because of the mineral oil from the lubristrip, I could not even notice the cuts. Normally on the 3 day shave, I have significant regrowth by the end of the 2nd day but because of the closer shave from the ProGlide SilverTouch, I didn&#x27;t notice the same level of regrowth until the middle of the 3rd day! The product was also able to handle a 1 week shave with the same level of comfort and ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One aspect that left me missing my ProGlide Power was the factor that the ProGlide SilverTouch was not battery powered. I feel that the power technology allows for the razor to glide effortlessly with no friction (ie. no tugging and pulling) or discomfort. I think the closeness and smoothness of the shave that I got from the ProGlide Power versus the ProGlide SilverTouch was comparable. However, the power technology coupled with the flexball would have been a killer combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rate the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Silvertouch handle 3 stars, because it really does fulfill what it is advertised to do and offers a comfortable shave, primarily because of the flexball technology and ergonomic design. (I would expect that if it was power operated, I would give it an additional star.) The 5-blades and microcomb allow for a smooth shave and remain resilient after repeated uses, but because the lubristrip wears out, the cartridge needs to be trashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s great about the Fusion razor series is that the innovators at Gillette are truly concerned about optimizing the shaving experience and the new products they release are not just marketing gimmicks but tried and tested improvements of their product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT – I have learned that there IS a version of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power, which would address the concern that I mention above. I am strongly considering switching to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Silvertouch Power because I think that would deliver an even better shaving experience.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors out on the market right now.  I&#x27;m used to just the Fusion Proglide, so adding the flexball technology improved my shave and gave me a closer and cleaner shave as I typically have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow around noon.</li>
    <li> Good product, the pivoting head works well. Have used a Quattro for years and have found the shave to be perhaps a tad closer with this Gillette.  The battery powered electric vibrating part is a little gimmicky, found that it was more annoying than shave improving.  Gimmick stuff aside, this is a good razor.</li>
    <li> I was already a Gillette user (Fusion Power Razor) and have been happy with the performance of it when I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball for free from Gillette. I&#x27;ve liked the power aspect of my old razor - when I use a non-power one, I can usually tell the difference (or at least I think I can). After trying the Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle, I would say that I&#x27;m getting an even better shave, but more because of the Fusion Proglide Razor than the Flexball feature. The thinner razors and improved lubrication strip seems to make a difference. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my old handle, but I have a feeling that it will be similar to what I&#x27;m getting with the Flexball handle. As for the Flexball handle, I personally don&#x27;t know if it makes that much of a difference if you&#x27;re shaving your face. Watching it in the mirror, it doesn&#x27;t seem to bend all that much - it does take some force to make it move. I think if you&#x27;re using it to shave your head or body, it may make more of a difference. Bottom line - I will probably make the switch when I run out of my current supply of razors.</li>
    <li> The razor is a pleasure to use . The flexible roller head makes it very easy to get the hard spots . Gillette fusion proglide is a must have.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette, and I am seriously in love with this razor.  As someone who needs to shave on a regular basis, it&#x27;s always nice to come across an improvement to something that I love that is an actual improvement.  No unicorn horn or Sasquatch hair...Just some smart engineering to make something great into something incredible.  It&#x27;s the closest shave I could hope for, but with more comfort.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. It&#x27;s the smoothest shave he has ever had. The flexball technology is wonderful because it really gets close to your skin. We will be buying this product soon.</li>
    <li> I like how this razor doesn&#x27;t pull hair as much as my other razors. I&#x27;m really impressed with this brand.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the coolest looking razor I have ever owned. It was like unwrapping a James Bond gadget. It gives a smooth, clean shave, and the flexible head is easy to use in one motion from cheek to neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a shaving aficionado akin to Andre Benjamin or Adrian Brody, so I don&#x27;t really see the difference between 4 blades or 5, or the point of the \\&quot;flexball\\&quot;. While using it like the razors I am accustomed to, it worked just fine. In my deliberate attempt to make use out of the flexball function, I think I went against the grain a bit and nicked myself...but maybe that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t read the instructions of this razor. I only have myself to blame for not reading the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside, I was very happy with this product and will certainly be replacing the cartridges as needed and going with the grain from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: This Gillette razor was given to me by Gillette to test and review.</li>
    <li> Very nice shave. I received mine through a testing promotion. Honestly don&#x27;t know if I will pay the high price for refills.</li>
    <li> I was very fortunate that Gillette sent me the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Razor with Flexball technology to try out for free. As I usually shave with razors containing only 1 blade, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how I would like this razor. I was pleasantly surprised. It left a very clean cut with no stubble. The flexball technology is pretty cool, definitely helped with reducing the amount of nicks during shaving, the reason I went back to single blade razors to begin with. All in all I am sold on this razor. If you want a razor that will leave a smooth, close shave and adjust to the contours of your face, this is the razor to use.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Silvertouch Razor from Gillette to try out for free. I&#x27;d like to share with everyone what I thought about the razor. First off It has been a great razor I really likes how smooth it left my face after shaving. Gillette razors have always been the razor I chose overall, would recommend this razor to everyone I know. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> i was given this razor as a company sample  first thing I notice was a solid razor handle  and its 5 cutting blades then I looked closer at what I would assume is a ball  but it was not a ball at all it was a spring like wire that gives the razor a left to right  movement  so I can not call it a ball at all  but while shaving with this razor it did give a nice clean shave as a 5 blade razor should give nothing less, I personally  I could not  tell much of a benefit  from the left and right pivot of the razor I think with out the so called ball you would still receive a good shave the razor is good for the close shave that&#x27;s all I could say about it really or just try it for your self.</li>
    <li> I read a review before I decides to write mine and I chuckled at the suggestion that the new razor looks like a Star Wars weapon. Now that I think about it, it&#x27;s true. I do like the razor that Gillette mailed to me but it&#x27;s about the same quality as all the cheaper disposable razors I buy. True enough, I shave my face and head daily so this blade will do me at least two good close shaves before disposing where as two disposables per shave gets pricey... About as pricey as a carriage refill for one of these here Star Wars devices. Given the price, without coupons I won&#x27;t buy this razor again. It doesn&#x27;t really stand out in the crowd. Nice looking but no different.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent this to my dad for free he absolutely loved it now it&#x27;s the only brand he wants the cut was smooth and he swears by them now</li>
    <li> A very smooth long lasting razor. Expensive but very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this product from Gillette and it was the second Gillette razor I have tried.  The first Gillette razor I tried was the Fusion Proglide Power handle with the blades.  My reaction to the latest iteration of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor (with FlexBall Technology) is much the same as the reaction to the Fusion Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these razors have provided great shaves, especially with the blades that come with the handle originally.  There is virtually no tug, the shave is extremely close, and your skin will feel great after the shave.  Usually I have some face irritation, but it seems to be far less with the Fusion ProGlide blades.  However, my experience after using the Fusion ProGlide Power for months is that the best blades you get are with the original handle.  For whatever reason the replacement blades don&#x27;t seem to provide as good of a shave and there is a noticeable increase in the amount of tug from the blades.  The difference was evident when I tried out the new handle with blades from right out of the package and noticed a distinct difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the handle itself, I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference comparing it to the Fusion ProGlide Power or any of the other similar handles I have used.  While shaving you don&#x27;t necessarily notice the ball although the corners do feel slightly smoother I suppose.  I was expecting to be able to feel the movement a little more, but the ball part of it feels a bit stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the benefits of this razor definitely lie in the blades.  They will give you the closest and most comfortable shave on the market, and the handle is good as any out there.  The one point of caution would be the price of the blades.  Replacement blades are pretty expensive (about $18 for 4 replacement cartridges) and don&#x27;t seem to have quite the same quality as the blades you get with the original handle.  Still, for those with sensitive skin, this is probably your best bet!</li>
    <li> I was happy to have opportunity to test this product free from Gillette from being a Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;I  liked the flexball technology, it did glide smoothly overly all the contours of my face and throat very well and also provided me with a comfortable, clean, close cut shave without any irritation and did not pull my whiskers or hairs at all, as some other razors in past have done. I really like the razor a lot, but the only negative for me, is that when I checked into buying refills for it, I found them to cost a lot more than other razors and more than I am willing to pay for refills, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;If that is not an issue for someone else, then I would highly recommend this  razor to them.&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the refills is the only thing preventing my review and rating of 5 stars instead of 4.</li>
    <li> Great grip on the razor made for a secure feeling. I was worried about the blade moving in ways that would cut me, but those worries went away using it for the first time.  The flexball really did the job and felt natural moving across my face.  I keep a goatee and beard and worked well being able to navigate my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued using the product and still no nicks or cuts.  Really enjoying the flexball movement.  I may try some more unique beard styles now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> My husband already uses the Gillette Fusion razor so I thought he might like to try this one out.  The base of the razor is what pivots creating a closer, more flexible shave.  The good news, is that you don&#x27;t have to get new blades for this.  If you&#x27;re already using the old fusion, those blades will work with this razor.  He liked it very much.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette for review.&lt;br /&gt;This new Proglide razor by Gillette is great. I didn&#x27;t think they could improve a razor any more then, Boom here they come with a pivoting blade. So much easier to shave. I used to have to angle the razor in different, awkward positions to get a smooth shave but now this new design minimizes that problem with its built in Flexball. This allows the blade to pivot in all directions. I had found myself using disposable razors for quite some time now but this new design by Gillette has changed my mind and I have disposed of me disposable razors...</li>
    <li> My husband has always used basic (the cheapest) razors.  He says now that this is the only razor he wants to use!  He says it shaves better than any razor he has ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t nick or cut and gives a really smooth shave with no tugging or pulling.  The flexball fits the contours of your face nicely.  The lotion or creme makes the shave even better.  It is rather pricey but shaves so well that it is worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love marketing gimmicks!&lt;br /&gt;It is the same for laundry products and razors. They were already claiming perfection but they have to justify their new models and prices...&lt;br /&gt;I must have tried already all their previous products.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The blades can last from a few days to a month, depending on your beard type.&lt;br /&gt;The price is outrageous as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must buy if you believe in the virtue of the flexball. Otherwise, the old ones do the same job...&lt;br /&gt;A final comment: beware of the mustache trimmer, I managed to cut myself with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect score minus one star because the previous models were already excellent.</li>
    <li> Have used this razor about two weeks now, I just have to say it is fantastic.  I have always been a electric shaver guy, but this gives a super close shave with out any irritation. It is a joy to use smooth operation and it feels good in the hands. I received this product for free to review, I liked it so well I would purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Gillette shaving products and was pleasantly surprised to receive the razor from the company. At first, I thought that this new razor with &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; technology was just going to be another gimmick, eventually to be mocked on SNL or another late night show. Boy was I surprised! I felt like the shave was much closer and smoother and I didn&#x27;t miss as many spots. You can tell that the flexball actually helps for a more consistent shave. Great razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a big supporter of Gillette products ever since I started shaving. The Gillette brand is well known for it&#x27;s amazing razor cartridges and they have not stopped making the best manual razor out there. I was sent a free Proglide razor from Gillette with their new Flexball handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been very pleased with the results. Usually in the mornings I use an electric razor but when I want a closer shave or need more control on my face I use a manual razor. I&#x27;ve never really been one to cut myself during shaving but using the new Flexball for the last few weeks I haven&#x27;t cut myself once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a problem with the razor not going with the contours of your face while shaving, then this razor will help you out. The Flexball does allow for the blade to move more with the curves and edges of your face. I&#x27;ve noticed myself not having to stretch out my face or open my mouth to get a close shave now too which is cool but not necessarily a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new handle it does make it easier to shave but honestly it isn&#x27;t life changing. I can easily get the same shave with the old style handle. It&#x27;s all about the cartridges and the Gillette cartridges are the best to shave with. The only thing I have against the cartridges are that the moisture strip runs out a little too fast for my liking. Other than that these cartridges are going to get you the best shave ever. I will continue buying from the Gillette Proglide line once I am done with this free sample.</li>
    <li> This is a great new product that gives you a super close shave every time. I have used Gillette razors for years, but this new ball technology is amazing. This is my new favorite razor!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette, and I love it. It moves not just back and forth but side to side. It conforms to the curves of my face exceptionally well. Super close shave with the multiple blades, and no nicks or cuts whatsoever. Great product will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I was sent the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Silver Touch Manual Razor from Gillette to review.  The way the razor forms to your face gives quite a good shave with less effort on your part. While the shave is good, the blades do not last all that long which is a bit of a disappointment. I am pleased with the quality and comfort of the shave just not the longevity of the blade.</li>
    <li> Received this from Gillette and have gotten the closest shave that I have had in a very long time.  Good job Gillette.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to sample the razor from Gilette and I was doubtful that this razor would be an upgrade over their older models.  I thought it was just a new name and a new face-lift. I was wrong. This flexball moves so the razor follows the contours of my sensitive face.  I was surprised that I was able to shave under my chin and below my lip without any cuts and on the first try.  I had my doubts, but I am not a fan of this razor.  I just hope that the cost of the cartridge replacement does not make find another razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom&lt;br /&gt;Flexball makes a difference</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor With Flexball from Gillette.  This razor is the most innovative razor I have ever used.  It lives up to the claim that it contours to the curves of the face.  The blades remove virtually all facial hair without razor drag.  The skin-conditioning strip leaves the skin exceptionally smooth.  I have found that with other multi-blade razors, hair particles can get stuck between blades making the razor difficult to clean.  However, the blades of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor are spaced so that hair does not collect between blades, leaving the blades clean and sharp.  I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor With Flexball to anyone who wants the closest shave with a minimal amount of effort.</li>
    <li> It worked well and seemed to get even the fininest hairs.  I have used mine for a couple weeks now and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> First off, I have used Gillette Fusion Proglide razors before, and have had a good experience with them. Using this new razor, with flexball handle technology just does not work as well for my face. Although the razor shaves well, it cuts/gives me razor burn underneath my chin, which has never happen to me before. Also, I feel like I have to make a couple of passes over the same spot, as when it flexes, it cuts closer on one side of the razor. The handle itself feels someone cheap compared to my past razors. Overall I will continue to use this razor as maybe I need to become accustom to how it contours to my face.</li>
    <li> i have receive my razor from  gillet and this is an awesome razor it glides so smoothly it does a great job</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette and when I tried it I really thought it was a quality product. It give a very clean smooth shave thats  lasts. It contours to your face very well also.  I have been using it for awhile now and its definitely going to be my shaver of choice from now on.</li>
    <li> Honestly there is a bit too much hype on the razor as Gillette&#x27;s lower end razor work equally the same. The pivot of the blades really doesn&#x27;t do anything extra. All in all it&#x27;s a basic razor that gave a good shave.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!!...This one of the best razors I have ever used.  Smooth as silk even as a dry shave.  Head even cleans good...unlike some razors.  I will be using this product for years!  Thanks Gillete :)</li>
    <li> It contours my face very well and leaves a very close shave. Haven&#x27;t had any cuts. I don&#x27;t use it every day and it works very well on longer hair. Very good shaver.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is one of the best razors I have used to shave with... I like the fact it cuts real close to the skin, without cutting you. It is such a smooth shave, and leaves your face feeling really smooth. I have used several other razors in the past, even other Gillette Razors, and nothing compares... I will recommend to other people.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me one of these to try for free the swivel head is great for getting those tough to reach spots the cut was smooth knocked out my tough beard easily without giving me razor burn the precison blade is my favorite feature so far Ill be buying this brand from here on out</li>
    <li> When I received this razor free from Gillette I was excited to test it out. While the razor works well and leaves skin smooth, I was surprised to find no real improvement upon past models. The pivoting head actually made shaving slightly more difficult as it didn&#x27;t allow forvthe normal and neccessary pressurevto get a close shave. I&#x27;d use this razor again, but wouldn&#x27;t search it out.</li>
    <li> I started using the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch several weeks ago and I have not had one nic since. The flow is amazing as I move across my face around the chin area the blade stays tight to the skin and the cartdrige follows along flawlessly. I have been a Gillette user for years and by far this is the best design I have used</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well, though it was a strange sensation to get use to when I&#x27;m use to pushing a little harder to get into certain spots on my neck particularly. Disclosure I recieved this product from Gillette for free for review!</li>
    <li> Best razor ever!!! I love how it gives me a close shave and does not irritate my skin. Now my face is smoother and I like how it gets hard to reach curves on my face.</li>
    <li> I had received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide silver touch manual Razor from Gillette. This razor with the many blades (5) as well as the flex-ball technology increases shaving efficiency and helped me ensure that I was able to shave areas clear of hair in one clean swipe. With the flex-ball, I could maneuver slightly better my facial contours and helped prevent cuts and knicks as it redirected pressure into a curve motion instead of cutting my skin. The blades with the flex-ball move on two axis, all I needed  to maneuver to each spot efficiently. The handle is of hefty well-constructed weight, comfortable and grippy in my hand. The head itself is made of high quality materials. It looks high tech and rust free. A very well made shaving instrument and a work of art in itself.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to test it out and it&#x27;s definitely the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. The shave is smooth and close without nicking your skin.</li>
    <li> It says one razor and one extra cartridge,but I looked repeatedly and no extra cartridge.The plastic package says it was made in Mexico.Well it seems that somebody doesn&#x27;t know how to count.</li>
    <li> After just a few shaves I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of this design.  The hefty handle is a nice touch, and although it can get a little slippery if your hand gets wet, I found that it wasn&#x27;t hard to control.  The ball moves in all directions, which is something I wasn&#x27;t used to.  But after a little practice, I was able to get a nice, clean shave in minimal time, without having to pull out the styptic pencil.  I can&#x27;t comment on the price because I got the razor from Gillette before it was released to the public, but I did see it get positive press on the June 8th CBS New Sunday Morning show as part of a documentary clip on the evolution of razors.  Overall, I like the design.</li>
    <li> Some context to kick things off: I maintain a short beard and only shave below my chin two times per week to keep things nice and clean. I recently replaced my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology, which I received for free from Gillette as part of a review campaign. Okay, on to the product. I was a big fan of the former razor; though it may have taken a few strokes to get skin smooth and I&#x27;d experience the occasional hair tug here and there, it was a fairly comfortable shave that never resulted in any nicks or irritation. The latter is quite nice; the shave is faster, easier and more precise, and it removes hair as well, if not better, than the Power Razor. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, but I have nicked myself both times I&#x27;ve used the razor in the same exact spot (lower neck). Overall, I can&#x27;t say that I prefer the ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology to my old razor (definitely don&#x27;t enjoy cutting myself), but it&#x27;s definitely just as good, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> First I am a BzzAgent and received this product free to try. I am a fan if the Gillette Fusion Razors. So I was excited to try the Flexball handle. The handle is compatible to all of the Gillette Fusion razors. The concept is great however it misses the mark on some things. Although it has the Fusion razors the movement of the Flexball keeps the razor from making consistent contact to the skin. So multiple passes are needed. Which is a disappointment given that the razors are great razors. Maybe if it had more directions to move instead of just side to side. I probably would still is it. But it is definitely not my go to handle.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch from Gillette through BzzAgent. It is very well constructed with a comfortable handle. The blades have held up for multiple shaves. It pivots around the curves of your face effortlessly and gave me a very fast, close shave with fewer passes over my face. There was no tugging, nicks, or irritation. Great razor!</li>
    <li> I first used the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall and noticed it was markedly better that the double blade disposables I have used in the past. The blades cut my facial hair close without any discomfort. At first I thought the blades were going to be too thin and the razor wouldn&#x27;t hold up  but I have been surprised as it has been a month and I haven&#x27;t had to change the blades at all. The overall comfort of the product has been better than expected. I think that I will be using the cheaper razors because the cheaper razors while inferior are more in my price range.</li>
    <li> After receiving this razor from Gillette as a sample, I wasn&#x27;t impressed as I may have been thinking. The Gillette brand still provides the exceptional cut they are known for but I think I will stay with the straight handle. The concept was ingeniously implemented and worked great for some portions, while some portions I wish I just had a straight handle. Putting an optional lock on the pivot would make for the next great step. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> When Gillette gave me the chance to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide with FlexBall I have to admit that I was pretty skeptical. I moved away from using the Fusion Proglide a while back in favor of a safety razor because of the decreased cost of the blades. But after a few weeks of using the new FlexBall handle I think I&#x27;m going to switch back. The FlexBall makes it easy for the razor to move with the contours of my face so that I can go straight from my cheek down to my neck in one stroke. This reduces the number of overall stokes and overall time needed to save my face. I feel like it also offers a smoother more consistent shave too. I don&#x27;t have to think about what angle I&#x27;m holding the razor at in order to get a close shave. It just pivots and flexes to always stay in contact with my skin. All I have to do is apply light pressure on the handle. I love it.</li>
    <li> My husband liked the shave I love the smoothness!&lt;br /&gt;It took less time for him to shave than it normally does.&lt;br /&gt;Great item, thank you Gillette for allowing us to try the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor!&lt;br /&gt;Love the Flexball!</li>
    <li> Loved it! I recieved this as a promotional gift from Gillette. I usually stick to Gillette anyway. I was shocked the difference this one made. I shave dry so i usually get a tad bit of burn and bumps. This gave me a very close smooth shave, and no razor burn. The ball helped to keep things even while going around contours. Thus preventing a few areas where i get razor burn the most.</li>
    <li> I just got the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall a few days ago, and I love it so far. What a close, comfortable shave! The blades are sharp enough and shave closely enough that they even made easy work of my 3-day stubble. I can&#x27;t tell that the Flexball does that much, really, but I will say that they&#x27;ve got something good going with the product.</li>
    <li> I got this product free to try through bzz agent and loved it! I always get razor burn and bumps but had no issues with this product!</li>
    <li> Not sure if Gillette is going away from its battery powered devices or thought maybe they are indeed too gimmicky, time will tell, but this Razor is quite nice.  I purchased 2 of the battery powered Gillettes so found this &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; razor a bit surprising.  But having not need to worry about batteries makes it all the more convenient.  Functions well so far, and as the commercials have portrayed, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all contorted our faces to get here and there....though I still do, that might be from habit.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from BZZAGENT , I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use any shaving cream and I got a very close, nonirritating shave.&lt;br /&gt;No pulling or cutting of my face. This is definitely a great new razor !</li>
    <li> I am a guy that is a stick to what you know person. I have used the same razors brand  for years. So therefore when I received this razor to try I went in with doubt&#x27;s. However I was surprised at the results. It was gentle on my face and the flex ball technology is wonderful for my sharp chin line. I get bad ingrown hair under my chin. But after using this razor for the last week I have not had any. I recommend this razor especially if you have sensitive skin it is amazing. And the price is great I have officially found my new razor.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs that its supposed to, it does a good job but then I&#x27;m partial to the old 3 blades wilkerson razors.it does a good job but it could be better,the blades are xpensive to refill so for my money it will stay on the shelf at walmart.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome! It makes my legs feel so soft and smooth with no stubble! Great product!</li>
    <li> So I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual for free from Gillette to evaluate.  I&#x27;m moderately impressed with it.  In order to give it a REAL work-out I allowed my beard to grow out for about 3 weeks.  Just past the itchy stage.  I then jumped into the shower, lathered up my face and shaved it off with the Proglide.  It was up to the task, but it couldn&#x27;t handle the thicker hair without many MANY passes.  Not a big deal, it&#x27;s designed for maintenance, not deforestation.  I&#x27;ve since used it a few times on 1-day and 2-day growth, and it zips over my faces and fits my contours on my face very well.  Even my wife grabbed it for... maintenance shaving.  Even after ripping through the beard on my face she found it comfortable, quick to use, and managed the curves and straights with little drama.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product, but a touch on the pricey side.  I give it a SOLID 4 stars, and would jump to 5 if they were a bit cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to add a bit to this due to having used the razor for a few more weeks.  I must say, I&#x27;m impressed by the longevity of the blades and their continued sharpness.  Not having to replace them nearly so often is a big boon in this design.  I do think that it could benefit by having a touch more space between blades to allow it to clear out more easily.  I find I have to smack it against my hand now and then to get the hair/trimmings out of it.  Not really a big problem and I still stand by my 4 stars.  It&#x27;s a great product from Gillette.</li>
    <li> Best dang razor a man can have or women for that matter. If you want a nice smooth shave for yourself without all the nics and cut this razor is for anyone that likes a clean finish. Myself I have sensitive skin so every time I use a low budget razor I&#x27;ll break out. With this razor I haven&#x27;t had that problem yet. Thanks Gillet for an awesome razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flaxball handle from Gillette to try out since I know what it means to get a good close shave.  They trusted me to put this thing through the motions and I did.  My experience in shaving really started in 2000 when I joined the military.  I had to shave every day for 11 years.  At that point, shaving became a daily habit, and I do consider myself a subject matter expert.  I have very thick facial hair so a lot of blades caused a large amount of discomfort and I learned quickly which ones were the \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; blades.  I have tried almost every blade out there.  I have used this razor for a full month and here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;5 blades make for a smooth, quick shave and it seems like the extra blades (5 vs. 3) seems to keep them sharper longer.  I&#x27;ve used it for a full 30 days and seems to still work like new.  This never happened with any 3 blade system I used before.&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head does allow for a HUGE increase in closeness around my chin and under the nose.  It did take a few days to get used to using to its full potential, but once I had it down it hit spots that I normally had to move my skin with the other hand to shave properly.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is well designed and allows for a great amount of control, and also provides a weight balance that makes it feel solid and well designed.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The blades are very close together (I&#x27;m guessing to allow for room for 5 blades on the head) and clog easily.  It takes a good shaking under the water for a few seconds just to get it cleaned out.&lt;br /&gt;The head is larger due to the extra blades and does require some careful navigating if you are trying to shave precisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I will keep using this razor and am EXTREMELY SATISFIED with it.</li>
    <li> Got this for free from Gillette, and Its the bees knees, his arms and his legs. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a closer shave. Its pretty awesome. Hopefully I can get more new stuff from them. Their products are pretty B.A.</li>
    <li> I received a free product sample from Gillette and I can say that I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor works exactly as described and is by far the best razor I have used. Compared to the past razors that do not have the Flex-Ball handle, this razor manages to get all those hard to reach areas by your chin and neck that the other razors could not reach. I recommend this razor to anyone in need of a new razor, especially if you had any complaints with your current razor missing hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> I received the razor from Gillette as a trial. I really liked the idea of the Flexball and was really looking forward to this product. It wasn&#x27;t great and it wasn&#x27;t terrible. It was just kind of average. I have a very sensitive neck and have been using the Proglide Power with great success and was expecting even more success from this one. I figured the Flexball would enhance the already great working Proglide and sadly it did not. It actually agitated my neck more. So it&#x27;s pretty average for me.</li>
    <li> While I personally think this handle is overrated and ridiculous, my friend to whom I gave it to as part of a shaving kit enjoys it, and that&#x27;s all that matters to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a fusion for years and wanted to try the ball.  I was very impressed with how well it shaved.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I give it 5 stars!</li>
