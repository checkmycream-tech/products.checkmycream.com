<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I know that when some people read patrouille they think it&#x27;s automatically going to smell very unnecessarily strong. But this is a very nicely mixed smell. The actual deodorant stick is kind of like a gel instead of a powder.</li>
    <li> I bought this product cause I was going all natural and organic. I have really sensitive skin so I heard this would help at first when u smell it it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all but it doesn&#x27;t make u Smell or sweat</li>
    <li> Smell great when your face is right in it but doesn&#x27;t do much for me..after 3 hours I had to reapply, I heave it to my daughter- an 8 year old, works well for her</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I still stink. Going to try the crystal stuff next. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but by the end of the day (at work sitting at a desk) I did not smell good at all.</li>
    <li> Have been using Tom&#x27;s for years but thought I&#x27;d try something new and I love the smell of this. Patchouli really is the dominant smell, but that&#x27;s fine by me. Seems to be effective.</li>
    <li> The Nature&#x27;s Gate Oranics Deodorant gives you 24 hour protection. The deodorant does not have any Aluminum. The price is also good. If you spend $25.00 or more on Amazon you get shipping but have to pay sales tax.</li>
    <li> Was trying to find a replacement for Toms of Maine deodorant I was using... I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but it doesn&#x27;t work too good on me... The smell is decent but I find myself reapplying this deodorant more often! Shipping was fast, product might be good but just didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> You have to watch out for these small business Like O wow, phony hippie real Libertarian  characters; and if you&#x27;re blaming Large corporations you&#x27;re blaming the wrong people: the former people only charge way too much under a phony facade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young Oriental woman said something like - &#x27;this makes me smell like an old Oriental woman and I&#x27;m too young to smell like that yet&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I bought it anyway because my drag character is an old Oriental woman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(just kidding). Anyway that young woman was being most generous because the orange part smells like orange cleaner fluid, remember that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Patchouli I used to put it in my beard and younger women claimed to like it (I think they just liked my beard and used the Patchouli as a pretense to get close to me) but the Patchouli mixed with the orange cleaner fluid scent makes the whole thing smell like mid level retail management trying to not be lumpen proletariat - but hey in terms of the economic growth Liberal economy mid level retail management is doing pretty good, they socked me for $6 on 1/4\\&quot; plugs that are unsuited for my purposes which they charge a $5.07 \\&quot;restocking fee\\&quot; for under pretense of here let us deduct $5.07 for shipping of what is essentially 2 nearly weightless objects, so is all of that worth the trouble for $1.29?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much for honesty and now here&#x27;s another $4 for this thing. So they&#x27;re plus $10 for 3 objects that are essentially worthless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you were crawling thru windows after a hard night and have to meet someone and the booze is like just barely wearing off, and you see this on someone&#x27;s shelf, maybe it would work IF you kept your arms down, but even thoroughly washed and clean this stuff lasts 2 to 3 hours tops and then it&#x27;s like greasy arm pits with no scent whatsoever except you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want good cheap deodorant - Arm and Hammer scentless - it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> pretty good.  we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts</li>
    <li> I really love this product,</li>
    <li> NOPE!!! This deodorant, like so many other natural/cruelty-free deodorants, made me stiiiiink worse than not wearing deodorant at all!</li>
    <li> love this deodorant, surprisingly it last for the entire day under my arm, which I never expected due to its natural ingredients. smells really nice, will buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price and it really works without all the chemicals in regular deodorants. Buying again!</li>
    <li> Smelled great after inital application, but actually made my body odor worse than wearing nothing after a short amount of time. My wife and I are both nurses and this deodorant was awful for the both of us!</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars because it lasts about 6 hours on me. I did switch from antiperspirant to just deodorant... so there maybe some culture shock going on. However, I think if they added just a smidge more fragrance to the mix, it would give the average person a few more hours of protection. The over all smell is nice.</li>
    <li> Does not work like my Sure did. Does not hold up. Put me in an embarrassing situation.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Great scent. As a man, I am very pleased with its gender neutral scent.  I was a bit concerned that it may smell flowery; I had no idea what patchouli smelled like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Excellent odor protection.  I would say it provides 24 hours of protection. In the interest of scientific research, I skipped showering for a day and no one in close proximity complained of me smelling like something out of The Walking Dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Non-irritating. Of all the deodorants I&#x27;ve tried over the years, this one appears to be most agreeable with my chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think about it, a deodorant is a product that is essentially on your body 24 hours a day: you put it on, take it off during your next shower, then put it right back on.  That makes it critical that you find a product that is gentle, non-toxic, and non-irritating. While I can&#x27;t completely attest to its toxicity, this deodorant seems so far to possess the other two qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Product quantity.  Like other reviews have said, the packaging is deceptive. There is only half the product you&#x27;d expect in packing of this size.  For that reason alone, I removed 1 star.</li>
    <li> Sorry, works OK but does not smell good. Can&#x27;t reccomend.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.  doesn&#x27;t smell very good ether</li>
    <li> Ugh the scent. I should have thought about it before I bought it. I think they were going to unisex?? Patchouli basically smells like BO and it&#x27;s strong here. I wasn&#x27;t huge on the gel form, but that&#x27;s just me. I THINK it&#x27;s working well as deodorant but I can&#x27;t tell because of the patchouli. I&#x27;m a dancer so I actually sweat and then have to get close to people. Maybe it would be better for someone with a desk job or something, but really why bother with something that&#x27;s not great?</li>
    <li> I put it on right after my shower and it actually made me smell like I hadn&#x27;t taken my shower. It also made my sweat smell stronger when I did start to sweat.</li>
    <li> Came in the mail before expected date, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Argh, the curse of sensitive skin! I wanted to like this deodorant so much but flaming armpits of hell are not my first choice. It had a nice and light smell that wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed with patchouli-some patchouli products can be. I had no choice but to give it to a friend who never told me how the product worked on sweat/smell, so that remains a mystery. Hopefully it&#x27;s working out better for others.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell that great and feels a bit oily? I dont feel as fresh as i do with other deodorant but i like supporting a good company :/ ill try some other ones i think</li>
    <li> The scent is very strong and really not a great smell.  I think I may have liked the product, but I would need to get it in a different scent.</li>
    <li> this smells much better than expected-a good patchouli scent w/o being overpowering.  Will buy again!5 more words-if i could only think of 5 more words-goes on clear</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant....great smell...organic...lasts quite a while...this is my second order....definately recommend</li>
    <li> Made my under arms red and itchy. Tried for 3 weeks. Back label was off so I was unable to read the ingredients.</li>
    <li> not as effective as arm and hammer when working out</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in February for $3.99 and I find it to be just right for me. Mild scent that blends with the scent I use and an effective deodorant. The problem? When I went to reorder today, the same product from the same vendor now is listed for over $7.00! AND is STILL not available in the larger size. If I didn&#x27;t have to drive so far, I would not order it again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product because I am obsessed with patchouli. Well I tried it and I didn&#x27;t like it very much. I happen to have a rough day and perspired out of stress and it didn&#x27;t work. My arms felt wet and it wasn&#x27;t even a hot day. I love the scent and I will still use it perhaps on cold days when you don&#x27;t need much protection but if you are looking for something to wear on hikes, stressful sweaty days or work outs this is a bad choice.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would smell great, but it smells musty like mold.  Not the smell you are going for in underarm deodorant!!</li>
    <li> I have a really hard time with natural deodorants.  I know they are better for me but for the most part they don&#x27;t work at all.  This has been the best I have found.  It&#x27;s a clear stick but not sticky nor greasy.  Smells nice too.  Breaking up with secret is still very hard but this makes it a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Smells great, didn&#x27;t protect for long enough.  Needs to be stronger.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. I am pregnant and am sweating more, anytime I sweat even a little bit I stink. I have to wash amd reapply at least 3 times a day. This was a total waste of money for me. I&#x27;ve gotten tired and having to buy and try something else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deoderant is all natural, no unnecessary additives (No aluminum inside this thing!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells a little odd at first but after awhile I&#x27;ve grown to love the smell. Only complaint, if I had one? It rubs off easily so I find myself applying it twice a day, once at the beginning after a shower, the other after I finish work or sometime in the afternoon when I&#x27;m winding down from the day. Works great!</li>
    <li> dont like smell and this does not last started noticing oder after 2 hours</li>
    <li> I tried this deodorant to get a break from a few more toxins out there, especially since you use deodorant every day.  I found it worked just fine in a 90 degree, humid, hot, East Coast (Baltimore, MD) day.  This particular flavor is mandarin orange and patchouli.  The patchouli is not overbearing, so it has a peaceful, calming scent.  (If you do not like patchouli, try another flavor.)  I have used  Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoo and conditioner and have been happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid stick in a hard plastic container and it applies smoothly to the pits.  It appears to be suitable for packing.  The turning wheel at the bottom works smoothly (unlike some other deodorants that you feel like you need a wrench to turn the wheel).  The container is 1.7 oz, 4 3/4 inches in height (about the size of a normal stick deodorant).  It is aluminum and paraben free.  No petroleum glycols and made with baking soda and vegetable enzymes to help neutralize odors. Cruelty free and vegan, without animal testing and no animal derived ingredients.  Made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give your pits a break and poo poo the parabens one more time :)</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  I have tried several natural deodorant brands, but they all created a bad odor.  This one actually eliminates odor, and doesn&#x27;t create its own bad odor when I sweat.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the mandarin Orange -patchouli lotion so when Amazon had an add-on deal for the deodorant ( 3 pack) I jumped on the deal to try the product. I only received one (instead of 3) , so I called customer service. They quickly apologized and said they would send the other two. When the box arrived, it only contained one instead of two, plus the paper work said I needed to return the defect product or I would be charged again. The original product was not defective. I called customer service and they said the listing for only one product and if I didn&#x27;t return the defective item, I would be charged. So I sent back the used deodorant. I like the product, but not the bait and switch for the product. PS: The original price was not worth it for the one item I received, plus the postage to return that one item.</li>
    <li> Not as fragrant as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I really love the fragrance of this deodorant, however it is moderately effective as a deodorant. I am a person that can use most any average deodorants with excellent results, but this product falls slightly below the mark.</li>
    <li> This is deodorant (not antiperspirant) obviously -so it works a little different than the APs. It used to be the most effective deodorant but this particular stick was sub-par. It could just be me or maybe this one wasn&#x27;t as fresh (the scent certainly wasn&#x27;t as strong), or maybe it was the reformulation (done so to make it &amp;#34;easier to apply&amp;#34; or something like that). It smells good and for me it lasts about 5-6 hours before a wash and re-apply is necessary. It was still effective, just not quite as effective as previously (where I could get a full 7-8 hours of protection). Still better than Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Went bowling, sat in the heat, and sweat. This stuff won me over and that&#x27;s hard to do with a deodorant with aluminum and petroleum!</li>
    <li> I love the scent but too WET for me</li>
    <li> I work in an air-conditioned office and this deodorant does not hold its own. It doesn&#x27;t even try. The heaviest labor I do is lifting a few boxes once a day. By lunch time I feel that this deodorant has worn off. I tried applying it a few times throughout the day and that does not help either. I feel like I stink worse when I wear this than when I do not wear deodorant at all. It also irritated my skin. Unfortunately, I had ordered multiple sticks so I just leave the cap off and use them as restroom air deodorizers. They do smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; deodorant and it works a lot better than this. My confidence is back up.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite deodorant for years now. The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering - just a hint of patchouli. It glides on smoothly and invisibly and never feels sticky. It works as it&#x27;s supposed to: my pits never smell bad. Great product with non-toxic ingredients. I&#x27;m happy that Amazon carries it; it&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 stars instead of 1 just because I&#x27;m one of those peeps with crazy body chemistry that has to switch deodarants every month or so because they stop working.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m constantly adapting or something.  Anyway, this one didn&#x27;t work from the start, which I kind of expected.  Disappointing since I&#x27;d really like to switch to all natural, but not at the expense of running everyone out of the room.  :(</li>
    <li> It smells great, but doesn&#x27;t last very long. I have to reapply it a few times a day.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> Very natural, no itching or irritation, smells and works great. Other Nature stores sell these things for $12 or more, a great buy</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it smells gorgeous, but only lasts for about 30 seconds.  within 30 minutes of using right after showering and staying indoors in the a/c, I smelled faint body odor.  If it worked, I would have loved it, but paying $7 for something that literally lasted 30 seconds?  I would have probably been better off rubbing essential oils on my armpit.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the patchouli-would rather of had mandarin only.  Smells musky or manly and works ok.  I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I know smell is completely subjective, but I really did quite like the smell of the patchouli and mandarin.  Love the earthy smell and a bit of citrus!  So I bought it and gave it a whirl.  My only problem is that it won&#x27;t last all day for me (it may work with all day with other bodies).  For me, it works for about 9 hours.  If it only lasted longer, this is the only deodorant I would buy!</li>
    <li> Very poor product. It did no good for us, and it felt funny when installed under my arms. Not to mention the smell.</li>
    <li> I notice a funny smell after a few hours. This happens to me with most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants. A funky smell of sweat (and I don&#x27;t sweat much) seems to follow me when I use this deodorant. I alternate using it with regular deos.</li>
    <li> It is better and easier to use than others I have tried. I am not a big fan of the smell but it sure is better than others and it does glide right on.</li>
    <li> Nice that it&#x27;s organic.  Does it work?  Not so much.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I wish it lasted longer, although it might just be me, as my hubby says it works great for him.</li>
    <li> I cannot make any comment on whether or not this deodorant works because I couldn&#x27;t bear to wear it long enough to find out. So many other comments said they loved the smell, so I figured even though it said patchouli that it couldn&#x27;t be that bad. I was wrong. I can barely smell any orange at all and the patchouli is very, very strong and unpleasant to me.</li>
    <li> This gentle deodorant is nice for days when you don&#x27;t need an antiperspirant. It is good to alternate days with.</li>
    <li> Were looking for a deodorant for our daughter, she has such sensitive skin and nothing worked until we found this product.  So affordable, and she loves it.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> arrived on time and love the natural product would recommend to any one who likes products with out chemicals in them</li>
    <li> So far I have no complaints. I was looking for an aluminum free deodorant and I think I have found the one!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as a deodorant. It does not control odor</li>
    <li> I like it. Less sticky than Toms and glides on easy. Very subtle natural smell. The patchouli is not overpowering as it is in other brands. This is the only natural stick deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried that holds me longer than a couple of hours. I get tired of wet roll-ons that take a little while to dry. This is now my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Smells great.... BUT doesn&#x27;t protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 15 mins. in the gym... maybe an hour out on the town... or a business meeting or two... its over.  No chance of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula needs to be re-worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINIMAL PROTECTION at best.</li>
    <li> Trying to make a positive change and remove the good old fashioned lady&#x27;s antiperspirant because of the aluminum. This is the first alternative I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent. Its like having aromatherapy :)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone else interesting in trying to impact their lives positively.</li>
    <li> works for both me and my husband - smells great! tried everything else natural, including Tom&#x27;s and crystals, and this is the only one that works for both of us. Sometimes we reapply before going to bed if not showering until morning, but only if a very sweaty day.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as expected but do the job.If you are not sweeting a lot it will control the odor.Smell good and easy to apply</li>
    <li> First time trying this product.guess I had high expectations.Like it would help prevent body odor.Doesn&#x27;t work for me.Fist time a deodorant failed me.</li>
    <li> You practically have to wash every day because the deodorant doesn&#x27;t lasts but a day or two. Should have gotten something stronger but it smells so good.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but it is complete ineffective for me. I put it on in the morning, and by lunch time, I smell only body odor and no deodorant. It&#x27;s still winter time, so I hardly sweat. There&#x27;s no way this could even almost work when I&#x27;m actually sweating.</li>
    <li> Great organic deodorant! Smells AMAZING. I love oranges. That&#x27;s pretty much why I ordered this. But anyways, the scent lasts long enough for me and it&#x27;s comfortable to wear. What else could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Before ordering make sure you have smelled patchouli and actually like it.  Such a strange smell- not pleasant to me.  It is hard to tell how well it keeps body odor at bay because the deodorant itself smells pretty yucky.</li>
    <li> Thanks for offering a safe product. IT does not work as well as the chemical laden counterparts but if applied a few times a day I dont smell my stench. The deoderant stone sold on amazon works better for me.</li>
    <li> I want to like this product but it doesn&#x27;t do much for me. I&#x27;ll apply it multiple times a day with little result. And worst of all, after sweating, this product actually smells worse than B.O.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works well for what it is, but is priced too high. I make my own deoderant and it is terrific and much cheaper. In general however it is a nice alternative to the store bought chemical garbage.</li>
    <li> Yes the smell is nice and it rolls on smoothly but it only takes a couple of hours before the telltale smell of body odor cuts through.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to find an organic (non-alumimun) cream roll on that works.</li>
    <li> not a fruit-flavored deodorant fancier...should not have purchased this...I prefer floral scents.</li>
    <li> Although I really enjoy my conditioners and shampoos from Nature&#x27;s Gate, their deodorant is worthless. Smells great, but prepare to have to apply every 3 hours.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is not good at all.&lt;br /&gt;I had to reapply 2-3x a day.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is good but, even when i would just stay home and not sweat i would have to re apply.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, but the deodorant part often falls out.</li>
    <li> This is exclusively a deodorant, but not an antiperspirant. The smell is nice, but barely any hints of patchouli in the scent. I would recommend just going to the store and buying some deodorant there. Pass on this product.</li>
    <li> you need to put it on every 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> The smell is like pine trees.  It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    <li> Has a nice scent but does get the job done. Does not stand up through out the day. Sorry will not buy again</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product, i don&#x27;t know why some people don&#x27;t like the natural smell of tangerine.&lt;br /&gt;im guessing that people are used to the robust smell of chemical filled deodorants. i wear my deodorant&lt;br /&gt;once a day on a normal day, and twice on a very sweaty busy day specially before gym.&lt;br /&gt;overall i am very pleased with this. thank you</li>
    <li> Felt stinky just a couple of hours after use.  It definitely  did not keep me fresh during/after workouts, as other alum free deos have.Liked the smell of the deodorant which would be the reason for the one star.</li>
    <li> Ok but still was kinda smelly after using it.</li>
    <li> Smells good but quickly turns to an unpleasant smell when I sweat. Might just be my chemistry, but for me it was just okay. Probably better for cooler temperatures.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the product, but I feel as though I can still smell sweat.  I realize this is deodorant &amp; not an antiperspirant so I expect to sweat, just not to smell it so much.</li>
    <li> My husband works outdoors and was hesitant but gave it a go. It works even in the heat of summer. He has never had odor but always used a typical mainstream antiperspirant/ deodorant and was unsure that deodorant alone would do it. But we both hate chemicals and try to go as natural as possible, this was just something he wasnt sure would do it alone. He loves it now, wont go back. Good smell and it works wonderful. Great product</li>
    <li> Updated: Tried this for a few more weeks.  It does a decent job when I wear it to work (Office Job) but seems to wear off after about 8-10 hours and I usually need to shower in the evenings.  It will wear off more quickly during periods of high physical activity.  The primary reason I can&#x27;t recommend this is because it has failed me every single time I&#x27;ve worn it to the gym. 20 minutes of high intensity cardio and this stuff is gone.</li>
    <li> It smells very good but if I sweat I do not smell good I have realized on some days .</li>
    <li> Works good as long as you reapply throughout the day, especially after any physical activity</li>
    <li> Natural and it works!</li>
    <li> As soon as I took off the cap the deodorant stick fell out and it also has a very unpleasant scent.</li>
    <li> It was just ok, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to the gym!</li>
    <li> I started off really liking this deodorant, and I&#x27;m ok with it not being an antiperspirant. However, after a few months of use, it really stopped working for me, and caused really noticeable body odor. In the meantime, I also experimented with Tom&#x27;s and Kiss My Face, and of the three, Kiss My Face is the one that seems to work best for me - of the deodorants that are aluminum-free and paraben-free.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the mandarin orange patchouli.  I use this as my main deodorant but it&#x27;s not for very hot days when you know you&#x27;re going to sweat a lot and need something stronger like an antipersperant.  I use this just in case I need it and because I like the smell.</li>
    <li> LOVE this fragrance and it lasts so well.</li>
    <li> This product does have a good smell to it and it&#x27;s worth buying and trying if you like a citrus scent.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and texture of this deodorant. i seek it out online to buy it. It&#x27;s not so effective for a 90 degree summer day&#x27;s worth of athletic activity, but it&#x27;s a nice pick-me-up if you want a little cheer in your deodorant cache.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work for me because I really wanted to find an all natural organic style deodorant but unfortunately it did not. I don&#x27;t like the gel form, it never absorbed and felt sticky  all the time and it didn&#x27;t smell the best, also it didn&#x27;t keep me smelling great all day either. I&#x27;ll probably try something similar but in powder form.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it worked very well and I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. It smells weird. Also, it doesn&#x27;t keep me dry.</li>
    <li> I have always needed to use extra strength or RX strength deodorant, but I have done away with most of my store bought, chemical laden soaps and lotions. I ordered this hoping it would work for me, but unfortunately, it doesnt. It does however have a very pleasnt smell and works great for my daughter. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Does not work. Smells bad...</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s a natural deodorant, but it doesn&#x27;t quite do the trick for protecting from odor, even on days I don&#x27;t sweat much and I&#x27;m one of the least stinky people I know!! I was disappointed, but I won&#x27;t throw it away, I&#x27;ll be using it in conjunction with my old deodorant (making sure I apply the organic deodorant first, then my old store bought deodorant on top).</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of patchouli, you will like this deodorant. I personally don&#x27;t and so can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great smell but was not as effective as I would like it to be, was not heavy at all, went on smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a useless deodorant, as I put a lot, but without any effect. Will never purchase again and will switch to a different brand.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the smell. Some did not like the smell of patchouli, and others did. I did not know what patchouli smelled like. Since I thought the price was reasonable, I gave it a try. I guess I&#x27;m not a fan of patchouli, but it&#x27;s okay enough to use. I have used it for two days now and have had no problem with the way I smelled. It kept me smelling okay (not stinking) for an entire 10 hour work shift. That&#x27;s all I can ask of a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recently learned about the dangers of aluminum in deodorants. I threw away all of my deodorants and anti-perspirants that I had at home and at work. This is the second aluminum-free deodorant I have purchased on Amazon. The first one smelled REALLY good! But it was very pricey and had shipping costs. I have ordered three other aluminum-free deodorants on Amazon, simply because I want to try a good variety and because I need deodorant for home, work and one for vacations. I cannot purchase these kind of deodorants locally, so thank goodness for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found out that anti-perspirants are bad for you because they clog up the pores in your arm pits; this is how they kep you from sweating. However, for anyone like myself, who is concerned about toxins, this also prevents toxins from sweating out of your system, via your arm pits. Because of this, I will no longer use anti-perspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this deodorant until it is gone. If I order again, it will depend on my opinion after having used it over a period of time, and of course the price.</li>
    <li> no aluminum! yess! That is what makes peoples arm pits dark and unhealthy looking from other deodorants, pretty much any deodorant that is for sale in the supermarket everywhere has harmful aluminum in them that causes darkened skin tone. Go natural and you wont have to worry about it. I used this one week and saw a difference, natural everything is the way to go,</li>
    <li> This is my favorite natural deodorant. I just can&#x27;t get enough of the smell. I am not someone who needs a strong deodorant. Most days, I can get by without wearing anything. I put this on before the gym or if I am going out on a hot or humid dady. Can&#x27;t get it at my local co-op so I buy it on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the product shrinking like other people have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews about the smell, since there were more people that said it smelled great. Wrong. It is terrible. To each his own. Aside from the bad smell, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my armpit odor.</li>
    <li> Smells good, slides on easy, keeps me smelling fresh all day long! What more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh right, ALL NATURAL! :D</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last longer than a couple of hours. I find myself applying then reapplying it. I&#x27;m the kind of person that needs to put deodorant on morning and night but I wanted something that would last during the day(or at least half the day) without using aluminum salts. I don&#x27;t mind the sweat so much as it&#x27;s more the odor that I&#x27;d like to cover up....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Glides on easily&lt;br /&gt;Natural product&lt;br /&gt;Smells great!! Like fresh oranges, I was concerned over the patchouli but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable&lt;br /&gt;Comes in an easy apply container&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours&lt;br /&gt;Have to keep applying, then applying some more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unfortunately WILL NOT be purchasing this product again though it&#x27;s not because I don&#x27;t love the smell or how it feels, but because I need something that will last longer. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week and I&#x27;m already halfway through!! I will continue my search for the perfect deodorant.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/3/14:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m changing my original review of 4 stars to 2 stars. This product works terribly for my needs, only lasts about an hour, and we&#x27;re in the middle of winter!! I don&#x27;t sweat profusely but the smell at the end of the day is worse than when I started out. This product smells nice on the tube but once I put it on it barely lasts. I will most definitely NOT be buying this deodorant again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. It was very ineffective. In fact it performed so poorly I had to replace it with a new product.</li>
    <li> I really like how this deodorant smells, and for an organic deodorant, I found that it worked pretty well! It also was not as sticky as many of the other organic deodorants have been.</li>
    <li> it might not be poison but as far as d/o goes, idk not a whole lot of smell to it, it doesn&#x27;t last that long either</li>
    <li> I like that it is natural but it smells EXACTLY like deodorant from a hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mix of citrus and spice could have been a better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keeps me smelling fresh and help slow down sweat. although its no an antiperspirant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works good, smell is ok</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s what I felt about this deodorant. Very strong unpleasant scent. Had to throw it away, it made me gag!</li>
    <li> Trying to be healthier but unfortunately you still think when you wear this</li>
    <li> I really love it, but I have to give 4/5 because my husband thinks it stinks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an aluminum free deodorant but so far haven&#x27;t had much luck. Although this one smells good and is free of chemicals, it does not last very long.</li>
    <li> I was excited about getting this, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work at all for me. It does smell good.</li>
    <li> This is really just...terrible. Like many others, I purchased this product thinking &#x27;well, I&#x27;ll try to use something more natural without the chemicals.&#x27; I&#x27;m sad to say, I&#x27;d rather go back to the chemicals. It isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s just ineffective (though it is, very), it&#x27;s that by the time you&#x27;re done lathering this on multiple times a day, just to keep the armpit odor away, something about the heavy patchouli scent makes you begin to smell like what I can only imagine is a middle-eastern goat market, the stench of which is only faintly covered by the overpowering sweetness of liquefied prunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two facts: It doesn&#x27;t provide coverage to help armpit odor. And in fact, it makes said natural armpit odor WORSE than if you used nothing at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
    <li> Smells great, works... but attracts bees and flys like honey</li>
    <li> Most other deodorants cause me to have skin irritation.  This one rarely does. Fragrance is mild but does the job and to me very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s aluminum free and organic, but I found that it only works if applied 4-5 times a day.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t care for the smell (I&#x27;m a woman).  I don&#x27;t know why companies insist on scenting their deodorant-- particularly natural ones. The whole point is that I&#x27;m trying to reduce the number of chemicals and things I&#x27;m putting on my body. Do away with the fragrance!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell of this product.  It works fine but just isnt my thing.</li>
    <li> I usually love Nature&#x27;s Gate products, however, this deoderant does not work at all. Other natural deodorants which work much, much better, are - Jungleman (good for men and women) and Herban Cowboy (also good for men and women). You can steer clear of antiperspirants and bad chemicals, but still stay fresh but this Nature&#x27;s Gate deodorant simply doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> Nice natural scents.  Cap slides off too easily.</li>
    <li> Love the scent however the deodorant doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.  I&#x27;m not totally disappointed with this product but would be nice if it was more effective.</li>
    <li> Fine product if you need it. I don&#x27;t. However, I do know someone who uses it regularly and they&#x27;re fairly content with the deodorant. Made in the US.</li>
    <li> i started having random allergic reactions to deodorants that i had used for years and could wear them for at least a year.  I tried this product without any issues so far.  there is essentially no fragrance, if any, it is very mild and seems to last the whole day.</li>
    <li> Great purchase for all individuals who can not use traditional deodorant because of allergies to metals.  I plan to continue to purchase this item for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Ive been using this deodorant for over three years and love it.  I wish there were more in the container . I dont know if the ingredients kill bacteria but I&#x27;ve noticed that the longer I used this deodorant the less odor I would develope and now, I dont get B.O at all, just a clean sweat smell when I do sweat.  I hope natures gate never stops making this and never changes the formula (except to maybe increase scent) I&#x27;d  love the Mandarin orange patchouli in a body spray or body oil. I also have sensitive skin and have not had any issues. I am also sensitive to scents and have never had any issues with this deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant! Love that it has a subtle clean sent to it, but not exceedingly strong. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in sweating between this one and my old chemically loaded &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34;, so I was happy about that, it seems to work great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and wanted to try a natural deodorant.  Unfortunately this product wasn&#x27;t strong enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to reapply it a few times a day.  For me it would wear off after a few hours.  No one told me I stunk, but I could smell myself which is not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched over to this [[ASIN:B001ET769Y Degree Men Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant, Extreme Blast, Twin Pack,(Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a natural deodorant, but it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> It feels a little oily when first applied, but that goes away. I find that the citrus smell fades and the patchouli becomes more dominant as it dries, which I personally love. I apply once in the morning and once at night, over my crystal deodorant for double protection  and I&#x27;m good to go. Much better than Tom&#x27;s. I will absolutely buy more once I run out.</li>
    <li> i love the scent, i love how it is natural.  i wish it was better at deodorizing, however. it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Good and non toxic but is not made for sports or for people the swepts a lot.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> Very good as aluminium free deoderant,,but wont last the whole day as my personal experience</li>
    <li> Não gostei, com temperatura alta ele nao resolve</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure which smells worse, the deodorant or my sweaty armpits while wearing the deodorant. I think it actually made me smell worse and sweat more. I barely even sweat. Not to mention it&#x27;s November,  not July.</li>
    <li> Smell is faint, no worries about other people freaking out about the patchouli smell. It works as well as most other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used-that is to say, not as well as the regular kind, but better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this deodorant but I am very disappointed in the smell. It seriously stinks! I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many natural deodorants, some with great success, some not so much. This one is by far the worst! I think it makes me smell worse than if I was wearing nothing at all. This is a natural deodorant fail. Save your money!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work --I still stink</li>
    <li> yum ...nice smell, and it works against body odor, is not an &#x27;antiperspirant&#x27; [that rates thumbs up for me] has &#x27;clean&#x27; ingredients and is priced right. what more could one ask for?</li>
    <li> Works well.  Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> My health conscious girlfriend tried this and it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Prime did refund me though!</li>
    <li> I like that this product was organic and aluminum-free. Especially because of the harmful chemicals used in today&#x27;s popular brand deodarants. Prepare to apply another coat before or after working out.</li>
    <li> My husband loves patchouli;so, this product seems to be a great choice. Also, the product should be better than more harmful brands. He will have to see if it is effective as well.</li>
    <li> Love that it is all natural! Definitely not antiperspirant but it does smell good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear antiperspirant because I&#x27;m breastfeeding and I couldn&#x27;t see myself paying $13 for primal pit paste. So glad I found this! Works well and smells pretty good. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> About to start buying it in bulk if that is at all possible!</li>
    <li> the cap doesnt stay on.  it broke off for no reason. not particularly strong. would not buy from natures gate again</li>
    <li> I just have to be honest and say that even though I tried to go natural with my deodorant and not use all the harsh chemicals and aluminum that most other deodorants have...this stuff just didn&#x27;t work. The scent makes you think you are going to be fresh but by the end of the day I just ended up smelling worse than if I hadn&#x27;t used any deodorant at all. Not sure what the deal with this stuff was.</li>
    <li> The cap does not stay on tightly, it is easy to come off and the smell is kind of rotten.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but odor protection is just a little on the weak side. I&#x27;ve been using Toms for years, and I thought I&#x27;d branch out. Nice fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, but if I have a day where I anticipate sweating more I use the old reliable Toms instead. I like this, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> Deodorant works great and it&#x27;s so much safer for the body. Stay away from aluminum!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the smell but it works</li>
    <li> This deodorant is ok. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. The only thing is that it really doesn&#x27;t stop my perspiration. It also doesn&#x27;t protect for a long period of time. Still on the search for a good deodorant.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and works good.</li>
    <li> Reordered this product because it works well, has no overpowering fragrance and no bad ingredients.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, keep in mind its deodorant not antiperspirant. So it will make you smell fresh and neutralize your underarm odor but will not keep you smelling fresh for overly long.</li>
    <li> Works well but it does have to be reapplied a few times a day. But if you are someone like me that prefers to use organics then you won&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it works pretty well.. I think my body had to get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to not having aluminum in my antiperspirant.  lol..&lt;br /&gt;Happy with this product and I am happy to be able to not have aluminum in my products anymore!  Thanks for creating these great scented products!</li>
    <li> My favorite smell and works well. I will buy more when I run out. Goes on nice. Not wet and not dry!</li>
    <li> If I took a scented candle and rubbed in on my pits, I would have the same level of odor protection that this &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a combination of deodorant (usually Arm and Hammer) and a scented cornstarch concoction I make myself. I do this not because I have allergies or I&#x27;m a hippie, but because I like making my own stuff and I&#x27;m cheap. This combination successfully neutralizes any smells even if I&#x27;m at an outdoor all day festival in the summer . I do sweat but I don&#x27;t smell like locker room after basketball practice, if you know what I mean. This Nature&#x27;s Gate stuff does not provide any odor protection for me and I believe it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  One of the worst choices I&#x27;ve made in a long time. This deodorant was very disappointing it wasn&#x27;t close to keeping me dry.  I went back to my Secret.  If I could give this mess a 1/2 star I would.</li>
    <li> Natural, not bad smelling, and sweat fighting! I am very happy with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my shirt and it seems to last.  (Although, I don&#x27;t really sweat a lot)</li>
    <li> It did what It was designed to do although It irritated my underarms, maybe to strong IDK but, the fragrance is not that great either wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> Yes, organic. It sounds great and all but after using it for a week, I was not impressed. I thought it actually made me smell worse because of its weird scent. I couldn&#x27;t figure out whether it wasn&#x27;t working and it was me that really stunk or if it was the scent of the deodorant and I just think it&#x27;s both. Not a fan, don&#x27;t like it, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It Smells soooo gross. Like a musk smell and it also feels sticky like I have glue under my arms. Also when I went to open it the whole thing came out of the container. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to deodorants.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and so far it&#x27;s been working great.  It has a pleasant smell and keeps me fresh all day long.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all! Smelled kind of weird. Everyone is different and may work for others. Felt grease and odd when applied. I use skin2spirit now and it is much better!</li>
    <li> I like this brand, is inexpensive, works very well and smells wonderful.I would highly recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural and vegan deodorant in the world! Cruelty free as well! Highly recommended! No longer do I have to smell bad!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it enough to see if it cut down on the odor  because I didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> I really like the fragrance although I tend to use it more on the weekends, when I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t offend anyone I&#x27;m in close contact with, rather than on work days. It&#x27;s fine if your routine is not one that gets you out of breath or includes intense workouts; in those cases, I&#x27;m not sure this would stand up to the challenge, or perhaps you&#x27;d have to reapply.</li>
    <li> Great product. I wears off after about 12 hours but it smells really great when I first put it on and it is nice to my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells pretty good, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to combat other smells. More annoyingly, it goes on feeling wet when applied and never dries, so it feels like your pits are sweaty from the instant you put it on until your next shower. For that reason I really prefer no deodorant to using this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for me but my boyfriend started using it as regular deodorant gives him a rash. He loves this deodorant. I definitely am ok with that because the smell is more masculine than I would like to wear</li>
    <li> I developed a rash after using it. I have never had this reaction before but i waited a week and tried it again and the same rash developed. I must be allergic?</li>
    <li> This has more of a manly smell than I liked.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells more like citrus in the tube but the patchouli scent comes out more when you put it on. Still a good scent in my opinion. It is a clear stick which is nice. Only giving 4 stars now because I am not able to determine how well it works yet. If it holds up during a workout, I would rate it 5.</li>
    <li> It has a patchouli smell which I like. However, I bought this knowing that it&#x27;s 1.7 oz size (unlike the regular 2.5 oz size), and I needed a smaller travel size deodorant. It turns out that it&#x27;s regular size - big plastic container with 1.7 oz of the actual product in it. Very disappointed. What&#x27;s the point? It&#x27;s misleading.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t prevent the smell</li>
    <li> Smells great. Feels great. Doesn&#x27;t do its job. And, like another baking soda based, aluminum free deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, my sweat was actually smellier after it soaked through the deodorant. Like, smelled worse than going au natural. If you don&#x27;t want or need an antiperspirant, just a deodorant, I recommend getting a mineral salt bar. Those will make your sweat smell about like water for at least 12 hours.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant for around the house and rate it as such because an organic product like this has never lasted very long. If you are getting this for your every day arm soap think again lol. It lasts about 4 hours on smelly manboys like myself so don&#x27;t expect much there. It&#x27;s for when I don&#x27;t want any kind of harsh chemicals on under my arms all day. And that is how I rate it.</li>
    <li> I received the deodorant a few days ago and was really excited to use it. It rolls on very easily and you can smell the citrus which is nice; however, it has a retro musk-y smell that in mine opinion makes it more suitable for men (I am a woman). I gave this to my husband who really likes the smell. I&#x27;ll set out to look for something more feminine.&lt;br /&gt;Note: the stick is very soft so if you press hard while applying it, you&#x27;ll go through the stick very quickly.</li>
    <li> This organic deodorant is not for me. I tossed it, if I didnt put it on atleast four times out the day, I would smell musty. I honestly think it depends on the person&#x27;s sweat level. I am now using Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant which works perfect for me. If you do not sweat much(I think this would be a decent deodorant for you). If you sweat more during the summer try something stronger ( Tom&#x27;s of Maine or Desert Essence works well for me.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Scent is not overbearing and I feel better knowing that I&#x27;m putting natural ingredients on my skin.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure about this yet, but still giving it a try. I&#x27;m trying to make the switch to a more natual deodorant, I&#x27;m not sure if I have found it in this. Still deciding.</li>
    <li> this stuff does not work.  Maybe if you apply every couple hours, but if you don&#x27;t, then you&#x27;re pretty stinky by the end of the day.  And it feels wierd too</li>
    <li> Smells horrible. Reminds me of an old man! Can&#x27;t even wear it because of the smell.</li>
    <li> I got this because the price was good, the reviews were good and I wanted to have a small stash of natural deoderants.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I have to say it smells awesome!  A person could use this as a light cologne (I think it&#x27;s a smell that women would really like.)</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t smell how i thought it would and didn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
    <li> Today is my first day trying the product. It smells wonderful, not at all too masculine (I&#x27;m a woman). I have high hopes for this product. Sometimes natural deodorants don&#x27;t last throughout the day or work when you need them to most. I have another brand that I have to use alongside baby powder. I really do want to continue using natural products and so far, I&#x27;m liking this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/13/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this deodorant and it works well for me. I&#x27;m not funky in the middle of the day and the smell is still mild and pleasant. I&#x27;m going to order another for my mom to use.</li>
    <li> I usually dont have odor but when I use this product and sweat, my underarms smell really bad.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Glad to find this scent and others they have created.</li>
    <li> Like the scent (more orange than patchouli--not what I really wanted, but I do like it), but it fades so fast, it&#x27;s not really worth much as a deodorant.  Sad, because it&#x27;s very nice in every other way.</li>
    <li> Smells great when applied but not as much protection as other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried. Tom&#x27;s is better but I try not to support them for personal reasons.</li>
    <li> The fruit blend deodorants&#x27; scent is actually quite nice, and it does seem to work... just not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; t lasts for a couple of hours on me, but after a few hours I can easily smell the tangy musk of man armpit lofting up out of my shirt. (Thankfully it&#x27;s not the worst smell in the world)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter, this deodorant may work longer as I&#x27;m not expecting to sweat as much, but I have a feeling it still won&#x27;t give me the anti-stink time I need to be a sexy confident stud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried rinsing it off and adding another layer, but that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result: Gave it a shot, but it just didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Works better than most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deoderants.</li>
    <li> love this!  Love the fragrance, and love that it is natural.  I have developed allergies to most deord.&#x27;s lately --so this is the solution.  love the patchouli frag.--not too loud--just a clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this deodorant after seeing so many good reviews. This product did nothing. It did not work at all, not even for an hour. It was as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant at all. I have been using natural deodorants for many years. This one was clearly a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have to reapply this multiple times a day. It doesn&#x27;t last very long and is too expensive for the amount you need to use to smell fresh.</li>
    <li> Whole Foods stopped carrying this product and I am thrilled to buy it here! It&#x27;s even a buck cheaper! I love this deodorant! I am gonna try the other scent next time.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted me to switch to a healthier choice in deodorant. I love the smell of orange and patchouli, so I thought I would give it a try. It smells great!!! It works great, too! On high stress work days, you might want to reapply. So happy I switched.</li>
    <li> This deodorant does not contain harmful chemicals.  Seems to help with odor but you still perspire.  Nice fragrance.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found something that&#x27;s very gentle to my skin, doesn&#x27;t give me any discomfort and smells great! Will buy again, definitely!</li>
    <li> I only buy cruelty free and usually buy another brand.  However, I thought the description of the scent on this would be nice.  I do find, however, that the actual deodorant does not last as long as I need it to.  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He said that it felt sticky after a while but the scent was pleasant and it didn&#x27;t keep him dry.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t quite get a 5 as she finds it doesn&#x27;t help a lot after track practice, she doesn&#x27; react to it as she does many, it doesn&#x27;t give me headaches the way chemically perfumed things she uses does, and she likes the smell.</li>
    <li> I use this and my other organic (homemade) deo. At first I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the patchouli, but now it has grown on me and actually smells fresh to me now. I still sweat, but I don&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> Smells great but makes me sweat more</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! The grapefruit is the only scent I&#x27;ve tried..smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews saying that is smelled great and works.. There must be something wrong with the product I received... It&#x27;s smells TERRIBLE!!!!!! My daughter used it once and was completely grossed out and asked me to buy her something different.. After getting her a different brand I thought I&#x27;d try this one out for myself.. I couldn&#x27;t believe how terrible it was!! It smelled like gym socks and a bunch of other nasty-grossness mixed all in one!! I couldn&#x27;t handle it and I had to get in the shower and wash it off....If you are looking into Nature&#x27;s Gate products, please don&#x27;t let this review detour you.. I use many of their other products and love them! Just not this one.</li>
    <li> As natural products are my &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;, I must say this deodorant is wonderful. The blend of orange and patchouli is extremely pleasant. Applies nicely and lasts. Would recommend to natural product loving people.....</li>
    <li> The product arrived without a cap so it dried before I had a chance to use it all, quality OK, nothing extraordinary.</li>
    <li> I dont think this works at all to be honest... I use nothing and smell and feel better than when I use this product... I was hoping to love this, but in the end, I wish I hadnt wasted my money... will probably end up in the trash</li>
    <li> I have used Nature&#x27;s Gate for 15 years. But this was the worse scent ever. The mandarin orange sounded good. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the patchouli. Well the combination made my armpit smell like a old Chinese woman. I know because I&#x27;m Asian, and I don&#x27;t want to smell like that. Maybe when I&#x27;m old, I will like it, but not right now.</li>
    <li> Smells so great, and works so well, that I ordered a second one in a different scent!</li>
    <li> organic yes, bad smell too</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells very good but like many other natural deodorants, the odor protection doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
    <li> This is certainly a reasonable price and hopefully will do a good job.  Have only used it a few time, so far.  It smells nice, without having a strong scent.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but it&#x27;s just very sticky and uncomfortable to wear and it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.  Maybe plain patchouli would be better. It was difficult for me to tell if it actually worked because I kept reshowering just to wash this sticky stuff off.</li>
    <li> I should have researched the scents before buying this because I can&#x27;t stand the Patchouli smell.  Besides the smell it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I have tried Tom&#x27;s and it at least worked most of the day.  This didn&#x27;t even make it through half the day.  The size is smaller too.  The package is the same as other deodorants but you get much less.  Sorry Nature&#x27;s Gate but not a fan!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff (male).  Not at all a strong patchouli smell.  I wear it all week long to my office and I feel clean and fresh and never feel like I exude a patchouli smell.  The patchouli and mandarin small are noticeable on application but that&#x27;s about it.  Gives e all day protection.  Not a work out / gym product though...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for an effective natural deodorant, and this isn&#x27;t it. I love that hippie-ish smell, but not on my underarms. The patchouli scent is overwhelming and on top of that I sweat right through this in a couple of hours. I don&#x27;t feel like I can wear this out of the house for fear that my b.o. will overwhelm people. Nature&#x27;s Gate is a great brand, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular product again.</li>
    <li> Smells great. No harsh chemicals and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! On the downside, it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Put it on before bed and woke up kinda musty. Seeking a new product with better performance. Also, it feels like chapstick for armpits.</li>
    <li> great company, and my favorite scent</li>
    <li> this smells great, however not very effective, I liked the idea of the natural but ....</li>
    <li> Never worked. Stinky after five minutes.</li>
    <li> This product is cheaply made and has only a very mild smell that does not last. I am also not sure why the picture shows two of the product, because you only get one.</li>
    <li> I am going to give this product a similar review to the one I gave Nature&#x27;s Gate Winter Clean Unscented deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Vegan&lt;br /&gt;*Easy on my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;*Nice fragrance, not girly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Weak defense against odors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My armpits react to many different soaps and deodorants, even without anti-antiperspirants. For example, Tom&#x27;s of Maine Lemon Grass gave me a rash. Luckily Nature&#x27;s Gate Winter Clean left me free of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not as effective at suppressing odors as I would like. And I tend to have less odor than the average dude. With a previous product, I was able get away with one swipe per armpit per day, maybe an extra swipe before exercise/sports. Unfortunately, that product is sold by a company which tests on animals. With Nature&#x27;s Gate Winter Clean, I sometimes end up with odor at the end of a day or night. This is with swiping up and down multiple times on each armpit. It also doesn&#x27;t clear up an existing odor too reliably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t so weak that I won&#x27;t finish the stick. I&#x27;m just applying it like crazy with no attempt to &amp;#34;make it last&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this product, I haven&#x27;t had itchy underarms as I had with the normal deodorant, and I haven&#x27;t had any sort of bumps or negative reaction. I was skeptical if it would work for smell, and it actually works really well. I use to have to use men&#x27;s deodorant sometimes in the summer it got so bad, but this has really been an awesome product and worked great all the way around, I am definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> I find that this really works no better than using nothing. I will go back to using magnesium oil spray for deodorant. It works great and I get my magnesium.</li>
    <li> dont panic its organic. im rating this good. legit. i love this product. love love love this product. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> For an all natural deodorant, this works pretty well for me. I&#x27;m very particular about these things and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of them, so on that front I give it 5 stars. My issue is that I&#x27;m paying the 2.5 ounce price for 1.7 ounces of product. Basically it&#x27;s a travel size portion in a full size dispenser. It&#x27;s a waste of plastic and frankly, a little deceptive. But overall a good product.</li>
