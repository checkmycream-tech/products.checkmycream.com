    <li> Just as described. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Best soap family and I used! We highly recommend for a soft feel, facial or body.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturize and helps reduce stretch marks on skin. Moringa soap is really great for those with dry skin. We defiantly continue ordering this moringa soap. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Like the shape of the bar, the lathering is really good, and it smells nice without being feminine/perfume-y.  Whether or not it is any better for my skin than other soaps, hard to say.  But I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I adore this soap. I have sensitive skin and I try to stay away from &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; bar soaps. This bar has a very delicate scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It also seems to last a very long time. I have not tried the other scents of this soap because I find this one very pleasant, but if they are subtle like this one, I&#x27;m sure they are nice as well.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great !  Leaves a clean fresh sent.  That&#x27;s a plus.  A little pricey but we will buy again.</li>

    <li> nice smell and remain it for a while.</li>
    <li> I was having such problems with my face skin. Rashes, especially on my eyelids and throat. Since I have been using this as a facial bar every morning and night the rashes have gone away. The rashes had to be caused by some ingredient in the other products I used to wash my face. I like something that soaps up! I don&#x27;t enjoy cream cleansers that don&#x27;t make me feel clean. This bar soaps up nice and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!!! I love the scent, the way it leaves my skin feeling after my shower too. I hope I never let myself run out of it. I also drink Moringa tea. It is very light and smooth, not harsh. All I can say is Moringa is a good thing.</li>
