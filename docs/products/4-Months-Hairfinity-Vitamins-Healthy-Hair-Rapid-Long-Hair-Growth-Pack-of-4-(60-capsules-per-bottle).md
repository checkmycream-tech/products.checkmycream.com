    <li> great job on healthy hair</li>
    <li> My hair stylist was shocked after 7 weeks when I returned to her chair my hair had grown several inches. I them told her I was taking the vitamins. I have been very pleased thus far with the results from the product. So much so I went back and purchased a 4 month supply</li>

    <li> great stuff. arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Best Price, Straight to your house</li>
    <li> It is amazing.  I was using rogaine for men to keep my hair from looking so thin.&lt;br /&gt; Hairfinity worked for me.  I keep my hair short, but it&#x27;s fuller and for the first time in my life I have fingernails,&lt;br /&gt;and I used to fold my fingers under to not show my thin, easily breakable nails.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try,&lt;br /&gt;but go for 3-4 months before you say it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Ok, i just received my bottles of the product and now I am about to start and document my progress. My hair is already 20&amp;#34; long and thick. So now I hope this product works! I will later track my progress and I will write my progress in 1-2 months. Then I will give you my ending results for the product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours Truly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KoreanCubaniQue</li>
    <li> It seemed to make my hair stronger but I used a treatment along with it. It definitely helps.I was hoping it would be much longer</li>
    <li> I used a 2 months supply of hair infinity  pills then  used a 3 months supply of hair finite supplements and then I reorder a 4 months supply. I have eaten 7months worth of hair infinity  pills and see no hair growth .  I do have fingernails though and 2 more bottles left over.  I rate hair infinity a 1, because it doesn&#x27;t make hair grow.</li>
    <li> Did not get full order</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not seen any results yet</li>
    <li> These really work!!! All I can say!!</li>
    <li> My hair shows noticible growth and I&#x27;ve only been taking the vitamims for a month!  I have recommended Hairfinity to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> It does me justuce you see results in 30 days 👍👍👍.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I first purchased a two month supply &amp; shared with my daughter. I already notice hair growth in about three weeks my hair is  now down my back  past my shoulder blades. My daughter also sees great hair growth.</li>
    <li> I am using it with boiten and I got a wouderful result</li>
    <li> I was using this for 6months I didn&#x27;t see much growth</li>
    <li> It was a great experience thank you very much</li>
    <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
    <li> There really worth every penny. I see results</li>
    <li> It seems to be working fine</li>
    <li> so sad ..some pills I&#x27;ve found open inside</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had any hair growth until I did a length check. By looking at my hair I didn&#x27;t think this worked at all. But I grew 1 inch in a month. My nails not so much of a difference but my skin is really loving these pills. I haven&#x27;t had a break out since I started taking these pills. I think I will be ordering these just for my skin. I&#x27;m on the 2nd bottle and I trimmed my ends but I will be checking the length before and after I did my trim to see if my hair grew for the 2nd bottle.</li>
