    <li> I LOVE IT WISH I GOT THE BLACK TOO</li>
    <li> Great clutch!  I bought this to wear to a wedding and received many compliments.  This bag is a very bright red which is exactly what I was looking for.  Very roomy inside for an envelope clutch.  The only downside is the strange smell of the bag.  Otherwise, I am so happy I made this purchase!!!</li>
    <li> inside pocket zipper broke shortly after using.  otherwise product quality is acceptable, considering it is a made in China product.</li>
    <li> Cheap material, it is not matte like the picture.</li>
    <li> this will be my spring purse</li>
    <li> Purse is as expected only draw back is it doesn&#x27;t  have an inside pocket but it a great buy and fits the occasion perfectly.</li>
    <li> The size of this bag is awesome.  It is large enough to fit just about everything in it.  I went out and was able to carry a pair of flats in my bag.  There was one slight disappointment, it came with an odour that was unbearable.  It had gasoline or benzene odour.  Had to use perfume and moth ball to try to get rid of the odour.</li>
    <li> I have still not been able to use it because of the chemical smell. Too bad it is a beautiful purse.</li>
    <li> The bag was larger than expected but I loved it. It&#x27;s spacious and roomy. The only problem was that there was a kerosene odour on the inside and the long and short straps are stained with black patches and have a strong smell of kerosene. Guess I&#x27;ll have to rock this purse without the straps! Overall good purchase!!!</li>
    <li> not bad for the price. It is well designed and the quality is pretty good. It comes with two types of stripes which is nice. As others said, it does have a strong smell. One thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is the pocket on the back. It is completed visible from inside which is cheap looking. But overall, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> So beautiful and so big</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! Cheap and broke</li>
    <li> Even after spraying it down with Febreze, the smell will not go away.  In addition, the strap was just stuffed into the purse which caused a permanent indentation in clutch.</li>
    <li> I loved this clutch perfect for clubs I never wore it with the strap but it comes with one this would make a perfect gift</li>
    <li> I received the red bag. The color in person is a little plastic-cheesy looking, but it&#x27;s great for the price. The over the shoulder strap isn&#x27;t long enough for any normal sized adult, maybe a small child. And it was wrapped in the packaging weird so it&#x27;s been kinked in weird spot, which I haven&#x27;t been able to fix. But it also comes with a wristlet, which I liked. The bag does have an odd odor to it when I first opened the packaging, but when I took the bag out for the first time I didn&#x27;t notice it. It seems to have gone away within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag does have a small zipper pocket on the back of it which is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the bag with great timing.</li>
    <li> The strap broke withen 10 mins of me wearing it</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought it would be. It is literally an envelope bag, as in there is no width to it at all.  It fit quite a bit, but parts of it were peeling off and it smells like gasoline even after three perfume baths.  Perfect bag if you cannot smell.</li>
    <li> I just received my clutch here at work and I love it. My co-workers love it also. The first thing I did was open it and smell it to see what all the commotion was about the inside smelling like kerosene and what ever other awful smell I read in the reviews. Mines smelled very good on the inside there was no funny smell. I also had 2 of my co-workers to smell it and they were baffled why I wanted them to smell the inside so I explained in some of the reviews I read they were saying there was funny smell on the inside. My strap was nicely folded on the inside and I did not see no permanent indentation in it like someone mentioned in their review. Bottom line I love my CLUTCH. I can&#x27;t wait to get the green and the black one. Thank you Neewer.</li>
    <li> Too big and cheap looking</li>
    <li> Received my purse today and its a nice size, but it&#x27;s closer to an orangy red than a fire engine red. Will have to air it out a bit because it has a plastic smell. For the price, it will work for the costume I&#x27;m putting together.</li>
    <li> Yes! finally the pefect addition to my Sundays Best wardrobe. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell at all....not sure what the other buyers are experiencing? Its pretty big. The color is great. Looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> As pictured , Loved it!</li>
    <li> Smelt weird but just let it air out for like a day and it was gone. Did fall apart after six months. But its cheap and cute. And I got a ton of compliments on it though.</li>
    <li> this bag is cheap and thats ok, but what i have a problem with is the zipper was sewn in backwards which makes it unable to use.</li>
    <li> This purse is larger than in the picture. I do love it, but the picture appears normal sized. In person, it&#x27;s very large, but still sturdy. Easy to wipe stuff off of it.</li>
    <li> Very kute purse.  My only complaint is that the strap isn&#x27;t long enough to wear it as a cross body purse..but it makes a cute large clutch!</li>
    <li> Poor materials and cheap looking</li>
    <li> Cheap is what you pay and cheap is what you get. Brackets were broken when I got it.</li>
    <li> Holds nothing except tissues and paper money and it smells awfull.</li>
