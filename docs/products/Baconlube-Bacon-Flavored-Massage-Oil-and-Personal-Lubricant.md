### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought this for my boyfriend because everything bacon is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;what is that wonderful aroma\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This was a great addition!</li>
      <li>genuinely awesome</li>
      <li>Great gag gift for the bacon officianado in your life!</li>
      <li>Have a good friend who LOVES bacon - they are even having a &amp;#34;Bacon Bar&amp;#34; at their wedding!</li>
      <li>A great poet once proclaimed \\&quot;This must be just like living in paradise\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s Baconlube, good sir\\</li>
      <li>Plus one star for surprising effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Bacon is fairly slippery already, what with all the grease.  </li>
      <li>I believe they loved it because they love bacon.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for this kind of activity.</li>
      <li>Soon after, that same breathtaking fragrance was drizzled all over me.</li>
      <li>Why sell a lube to make it more slippery?  </li>
      <li>and we enjoyed it.  </li>
      <li>It might be OK for a gag gift.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even want it touching me.</li>
      <li>It tastes more like the inside of rubber bike tire smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;But if you are more tickled by the novelty of owning such an item it makes for a great shelf item to showcase your bacon enthusiasm.</li>
      <li>quick delivery good product thanks</li>
      <li>&quot; she responded with a playful wink, and asked me to turn over so she could begin her work on the front portion of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baconlube; a coalescence of the most fantastic of scents and the most intimate of circumstances.</li>
      <li>It was very fun</li>
      <li>The look on his face was totally worth the pants and chair!)</li>
      <li>It would not surprise me one bit if he was experiencing Baconlube when he wrote that, because I encountered true nirvana from this</li>
      <li>Worth the laugh!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>I have never heardy husband laugh louder.</li>
      <li>please* make the label more clear.</li>
      <li>I gave this present to a dear bacon loving friend, and they totally appreciated it for that.  </li>
      <li>I have no idea how it feels or works, but it is something unusual to get that person who loves bacon and is quite funny!</li>
      <li>Packaging looked a little worn, but product was good.</li>
      <li>Bought this as a joke and interested.</li>
      <li>Funny novelty tho</li>
      <li>This was a funny bridal shower gift for the bride and her hubby.</li>
      <li>All in all a funny as hell birthday gift.</li>
      <li>shipping was super fast though so two thumbs up for the Domestic Platypus for the fast handling!!</li>
      <li>bacon grease would be a lot better but not very sanitary.</li>
      <li>Smells like bacon but not so much on the taste.</li>
      <li>The packaging fails to warn you that you need to allow your bacon time to cool before becoming \\&quot;intimate\\&quot; with it.</li>
      <li>So I ordered this to write a review on it and honestly it has been the most disgusting experience of my life.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s worse is that I couldn&#x27;t even enjoy the bacon with all the lube on it; I really had to force myself to eat the entire package of bacon, which is normally not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was pure ecstasy as the masseuse worked the Baconlube into every one of my tight, aching muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> (Hehe, I don&#x27;t think the guy in the next cubicle was any less surprised than I was!</li>
<li> sorry...love my Bacon...but hard to get past the smell of dog food to enjoy item.  </li>
<li> its was such a dissapointment so not worth it</li>
<li> We opened it, and it smelled and tasted like dog food gravy, not sure anyone could stomach that for very long....</li>
<li> this past Tuesday afternoon, as I lay face down on the massage table with my eyes closed, I thought to myself</li>
<li> A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so bad it can&#x27;t be funny.</li>
<li> If this lube is supposed to taste like bacon then whomever made it has never enjoyed the blissful taste of bacon.  </li>
<li> lube works fine as a lube, but the smell is so awful that it will leave you reeling.</li>
<li> As per group policy, lately I have been using this on my cockwombling adventures.</li>
<li> Try it for yourself and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.  </li>
<li> It was not a good purchase.</li>
<li> I think I was using this all wrong: you add it to Bacon to lube up your digestion process.  </li>
<li> Even the worst bacon could never be this gross...</li>
<li> I still can&#x27;t believe they would label it so vaguely.  </li>
<li> However if your husband is a serious bacon lover you will be disappointed.</li>
<li> What a bad idea to make Baconlube.  </li>
<li> disappointed in the product for that reason.</li>
<li> It smells terrible and not like bacon at all!</li>
<li> this is so nasty doesnt even smell like bacon, dont but save ut money</li>

    <li> Bought it as a gag gift and it was a hit! She ended up passing it around and had everyone &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; it. Smells like bacon but not so much on the taste. All in all a funny as hell birthday gift.</li>
    <li> As per group policy, lately I have been using this on my cockwombling adventures. I would recommend this product for this kind of activity.</li>
    <li> sorry...love my Bacon...but hard to get past the smell of dog food to enjoy item.  Funny novelty tho</li>
    <li> I puked. She puked. The dog puked.&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lube works fine as a lube, but the smell is so awful that it will leave you reeling.</li>
    <li> Foul stench, and not actually bacon-flavored</li>
    <li> This was a funny bridal shower gift for the bride and her hubby. I believe they loved it because they love bacon.</li>
    <li> Have a good friend who LOVES bacon - they are even having a &amp;#34;Bacon Bar&amp;#34; at their wedding! This was a great addition!</li>
    <li> Not as described. It did not taste like bacon or smell like bacon. We tried it one time and that was enough. In the trash it went.</li>
    <li> quick delivery good product thanks</li>
    <li> Packaging looked a little worn, but product was good.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a bacon lover and it was a big hit.  I have no idea how it feels or works, but it is something unusual to get that person who loves bacon and is quite funny!</li>
    <li> The packaging fails to warn you that you need to allow your bacon time to cool before becoming \\&quot;intimate\\&quot; with it. Two stars because it seems like it should function well as lube. I will give it a try again when the burns heal.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this to write a review on it and honestly it has been the most disgusting experience of my life. Even the worst bacon could never be this gross... It&#x27;s been hours since I put it away after only smelling it and I&#x27;m still nauseous!! Don&#x27;t get this, not even as a joke! It&#x27;s so bad it can&#x27;t be funny. Ew ew ew!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was super fast though so two thumbs up for the Domestic Platypus for the fast handling!!</li>
    <li> It might be OK for a gag gift.  However if your husband is a serious bacon lover you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because everything bacon is wonderful!  It was very fun and we enjoyed it.  Every man needs baconlube!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a joke and interested. It smells terrible and not like bacon at all! I don&#x27;t even want it touching me. It was not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> For my bacon collection</li>
    <li> I have never heardy husband laugh louder. Great gag gift for the bacon officianado in your life! Worth the laugh!</li>
    <li> If this lube is supposed to taste like bacon then whomever made it has never enjoyed the blissful taste of bacon.  It tastes more like the inside of rubber bike tire smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are more tickled by the novelty of owning such an item it makes for a great shelf item to showcase your bacon enthusiasm.</li>
    <li> I found this to be just the thing for lubrication of donut holes.  Try it for yourself and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.  A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
    <li> bacon grease would be a lot better but not very sanitary. it is not something that I would try twice.</li>
    <li> this is so nasty doesnt even smell like bacon, dont but save ut money its was such a dissapointment so not worth it</li>
    <li> Smells like chemical-laced Spam.  Gross.  Given as a gag gift.  That&#x27;s about all it&#x27;s worth.  Actually kinda made me gag...so it got an extra star.</li>
    <li> What a bad idea to make Baconlube.  Bacon is fairly slippery already, what with all the grease.  Why sell a lube to make it more slippery?  What&#x27;s worse is that I couldn&#x27;t even enjoy the bacon with all the lube on it; I really had to force myself to eat the entire package of bacon, which is normally not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[update]&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I get it now-- I think I was using this all wrong: you add it to Bacon to lube up your digestion process.  Plus one star for surprising effectiveness. (Hehe, I don&#x27;t think the guy in the next cubicle was any less surprised than I was! The look on his face was totally worth the pants and chair!) ...I still can&#x27;t believe they would label it so vaguely.  I bet I&#x27;m not the only person who has had this problem.  Manufacturers, *please* make the label more clear.</li>
    <li> I gave this present to a dear bacon loving friend, and they totally appreciated it for that.  We opened it, and it smelled and tasted like dog food gravy, not sure anyone could stomach that for very long....disappointed in the product for that reason.</li>

Soon after, that same breathtaking fragrance was drizzled all over me. It was pure ecstasy as the masseuse worked the Baconlube into every one of my tight, aching muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;What is this lotion of the gods that you have used to relax my back while stimulating my nasal passages\\&quot; I asked her? \\&quot;Why it&#x27;s Baconlube, good sir\\&quot; she responded with a playful wink, and asked me to turn over so she could begin her work on the front portion of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baconlube; a coalescence of the most fantastic of scents and the most intimate of circumstances. The creator of Baconlube is to be commended along with his/her innovation in massage oil and personal lubricant technology. Hail the creator!</li>
