      <li>Vitamin C is a huge trend in the skin care world right now and it is really effective for skin that seems to be aging harshly and needs a touch up.</li>
      <li>was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>But I really believe this product does a lot for my skin!</li>
      <li>Came across a lot of studies supporting the use of vitamin C serums and chose this product based on the number of favorable reviews and the price.</li>
      <li>, it is great product helps in completes vitamin c needs and also prevents acne and mainly its helps in eyes dark circles and completely remove them.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>

      <li>Vitamin C topical products have long been part of super-expensive beauty regimes....and for good reason.</li>

      <li>This serum is not irritating to the skin.</li>

      <li>I like that better than some other boastful claim.</li>
      <li>This Vitamin C serum is exactly what I was looking for to keep my skin young and radiant!.</li>
      <li>I don’t need any other beauty product after using this because it fulfill my all need and gives better result.</li>

      <li>you know it&#x27;s quality stuff not like some others that comes in a clear bottle</li>
      <li>Let me say that it has really helped with the white heads</li>
      <li>so I have decided to go the natural way and try this vitamin C serum</li>
      <li>But this serum really does have the strength to reduce &amp; redefine you and not let facial lines do that for you against your will.</li>
      <li>and I really noticed a overall tightening of my skin.</li>
      <li>Though I&#x27;m only twenty-three, I am very concerned about the prospect of wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It is a little harder to apply vs the C30, but I just mixed a few dabs of aloe vera with a few drops and it worked great!</li>
      <li>course I know this only after researching options for naturally removing and preventing wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It can reduce inflammation and irritation, both of which cause damage and it fades post-breakout red marks by improving the skin’s natural healing response too.  </li>

    <li> Though I&#x27;m only twenty-three, I am very concerned about the prospect of wrinkles. I am constantly looking for ways to moisturize my skin, and because I&#x27;m a smoker I am even more concerned than a typically vain millennial. A friend recommended Bleu Beaute&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum because it had worked wonders for her. After only two weeks of use, I&#x27;m happy to report that I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is moister and has that &amp;#34;healthy glow&amp;#34; they&#x27;re always prattling on about in skin-care commercials. I also appreciate any chance to get more vitamin C into my body. The serum is plentiful enough for at least a month&#x27;s worth of use, perhaps two if you&#x27;re stingy with application. I&#x27;ve since compared this product with equivalent serums on the market and found it came out on top: higher quality ingredients, more product, and a better price. I highly recommend the serum for anyone even slightly worried about their skin!</li>
    <li> I’ve used this Vitamin C serum for a couple months and I love it! I’m not one to wear a lot of make up or use a ton of skin care stuff. But I really believe this product does a lot for my skin! I&#x27;ve seen such a difference in my time since using it. I really like the way how good it feels when I apply it, also that it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn’t leave my skin dry. Such a good Product! So glad my friend introduced me to it.</li>
    <li> Quality serum priced extremely well!</li>
    <li> I am now 35 and started to notice some laugh lines and crows feet around my eyes so I have decided to go the natural way and try this vitamin C serum, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks since and I have noticed a difference my face looks more youthful and bright no more acne scars or dark under eye circles, all you need is to rub this on day or night make sure to use with sunscreen for daytime also store in the fridge and it will last longer you can also separate into 2 bottles keep one in the fridge. This Bleu Beaute product is amazing you know it&#x27;s quality stuff not like some others that comes in a clear bottle, if you know about vitamin C serum you know it should come in a bottle like this one .</li>
    <li> If you want to give your skin a healthy glow, have smoother skin appearance and work on getting rid of acne marks and wrinkles then try this serum.  Vitamin C Serum reduces the appearance of brown spots and other types of sun damage as well as helping to boost healthy collagen production. It can reduce inflammation and irritation, both of which cause damage and it fades post-breakout red marks by improving the skin’s natural healing response too.  Try a small amount twice a day, as part of your usual skin care routine and differences can be seen within 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I like that better than some other boastful claim. But this serum really does have the strength to reduce &amp; redefine you and not let facial lines do that for you against your will. A formula specifically designed to reduce lines, crows feet, sub-orbital wrinkles while improving skin texture and radiance. Fabulous, in other words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also, and since it is the onset of summer, will boost collagen, while helping to repair sunspots, damage, dark circles, fades &amp; spots. If you spend as much time engaged in outdoor activities (esp. w/ children) or like to spend long days at the pool, this is a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed benefits right away as the serum is absorbed rapidly into the skin, it&#x27;s super smooth and packed with vitamins. I love it+</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed. Definetly not worth the price, and it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s promise. I regret buying this, and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have used c serums I liked a lot better.  Bought this for the size/price.  Does not smell good, and is watery, not really a serum.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering  more of it..</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C serum is exactly what I was looking for to keep my skin young and radiant!. My dermatologist recommended this product and I found it here on amazon. The price is really great and the shipping was fast. I have been using this product for one month now and I really noticed a overall tightening of my skin. It support collagen production and makes your skin flexible so you don&#x27;t get as much wrinkles with aging. I am really happy with the purchase and wanted to let you know my results with the product. I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> An Organic Vitamin C serum. This is the second Vitamin c serum I have tried. I am seeing minor lightening of some dark spots above my lip. Unlike the other serum, this one leaves my face feeling soft, not sticky. Very much enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to give it another star, but so far I am pleased.Amazing product. Saw results within a few days. Love this line. All natural products that really work as they claim. My skin looks radiant. Absolutely wonderful and a total bargain for the results I have seen! I would recommend that anyone give it a try.</li>
    <li> Have not used long enough to evaluate</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman in her 40&#x27;s and I have been using this product for a week now. Let me say that it has really helped with the white heads i get on my chin. I can tell that my skin looks brighter and more vibrant. I will do a follow up rating once it has been 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;Red</li>
    <li> Too soon to review about the effect of the product, but as promised the delivery was fast, will complete the review once result is achieved.</li>
    <li> This is such a helpful product for all skin types. Vitamin C is a huge trend in the skin care world right now and it is really effective for skin that seems to be aging harshly and needs a touch up. I prefer to use this at night just so it doesn&#x27;t mix with my make up in the morning. It is pleasantly easy to use and you see results right away. I like that at 22 I can see my skin getting brighter and healthier using this a couple of times a week, or after harsh sun exposure.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C topical products have long been part of super-expensive beauty regimes....and for good reason. Vitamin C is well-known for its ability to brighten your skin and repair skin damage. It&#x27;s also really good for lightening dark spots and moderating your overall skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I know this only after researching options for naturally removing and preventing wrinkles. Came across a lot of studies supporting the use of vitamin C serums and chose this product based on the number of favorable reviews and the price. I can&#x27;t attest to the long term benefits of use (yet) but I can say that I received a quality product, well-packaged, and shipped in a timely fashion. Recommended product and seller.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so the fact that this serum is 100% Vegan, 72% Organic and fragrance-free is very important to me. This serum is not irritating to the skin. This is also a 2 oz bottle which might not sound like a lot, but the majority of serums come in a 1 oz size, so if you&#x27;re comp shopping keep that in mind. The Witch Hazel also provides a nice cooling effect when you apply it. I do not wear foundation so pay close attention to the overall tone of my skin&#x27;s tone. After a very short amount of time, my skin looks brighter. The finer lines around the edges of my mouth and corners of my eyes have really began to diminish. I am impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•  American Made&lt;br /&gt;•  Vegan&lt;br /&gt;•  Cruelty-Free&lt;br /&gt;•  Fragrance-Free&lt;br /&gt;•  Organic</li>
    <li> I am receptionist and looking good is very important in my line of work and with my growing age, I need something great which fulfill my skins need and I choose to go for this vitamin C serum and believe me after its great result I am very satisfied, it is great product helps in completes vitamin c needs and also prevents acne and mainly its helps in eyes dark circles and completely remove them.&lt;br /&gt;Now I don’t need any other beauty product after using this because it fulfill my all need and gives better result.</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant scent. I have used this for about 2 weeks now and really like the results. I wash my face and use a toner and then apply this vitamin C serum followed by moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with irritation and it has help to improve my complexion. This serum is not greasy and goes on good and soaks into my skin quickly. I don&#x27;t have to set and wait on my face to dry. I can move on to the next thing. This bottle is a good size so it will last for a while. I like this vitamin C serum and would recommend it. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I like the the 2 oz size and the price was very reasonable. It is a little harder to apply vs the C30, but I just mixed a few dabs of aloe vera with a few drops and it worked great!</li>
    <li> This by far is tho most amazing and effective vitamin C I have ever used! I&#x27;ve tried different products for my face and did not see any results but this one actually gives you result in just 1st used! I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a prefect vitamin C!</li>
