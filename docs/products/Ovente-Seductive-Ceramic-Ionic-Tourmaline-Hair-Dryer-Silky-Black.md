      <li>This is a powerful, quick, perfect hair dryer.</li>
      <li>am really glad I chose this one.  </li>

      <li>You wont be able to unscew the filter screen after that; but doing this will keep it from falling off.</li>

      <li>Love this blow dryer</li>
      <li>I love this hair</li>
      <li>but they won&#x27;t ship Andis here any more.  </li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>The Andis has many better heat options</li>
      <li>the \\&quot;Super Salon\\&quot; and \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; in the name, or because the original price was $200 (I easily get sucked in by great deals).  </li>
      <li>it worked great for us and my wife who has long hair loved it</li>
      <li>It comes in the ceramic/tourmaline design that is popular now, but more importantly, this dryer&#x27;s wattage is much higher than most hair dryers out there (and I&#x27;ve looked!).  </li>
      <li>This hairdryer was really good at first.</li>
      <li>Make sure to  used glue that isnt too strong because you have to remove this piece to fix anything inside the unit.</li>
      <li>This is an amazingly sturdy and powerful hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>It has a great power and it worked like a professional hairdryer which you can find in a hair saloon.</li>
      <li>This thing BLASTS the air out and the flow is so strong it could damage your ear if aimed improperly either by air pressure or noise from the airflow over the ear.</li>
      <li>It is the most powerful available which cuts drying time.</li>
      <li>Pro was a great dryer but was bigger and heavier than this one.  </li>
      <li>It arrived promptly and it is the same great quality as the on ewe had overseas</li>
      <li>Overall great hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is a really cheap product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to use/hold.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>After Finding out that the return period is over for this product, I had a quick chat with amazon representative and they were able to provide me with a return label for full refund as an exception.</li>
      <li>This is the first time that I have been satisfied with  my \\&quot;at home\\&quot; hair results.</li>
      <li>the design is simple and nothing special but it is damn powerful and works great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame since the dryer was quick.</li>
      <li>Dries my hair quickly.  </li>
      <li>Really dries my hair quickly and allows for easy styling.  </li>
      <li>I (originally) ended up rating this 3 stars only because it dries my shoulder length hair so fast at top speed and top heat.</li>
      <li>At full speed this thing has a very powerful flow of air and is also Jet engine fast and cannot be used on my dog which is 1/2 the reason for me needing the dryer.  </li>
      <li>Even though the product says it is 2800-watt, I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference between this one and my good old ConAir from Walmart.  </li>
      <li>This is a salon type product and well worth the price.</li>
      <li>This dryer could have gotten more stars from me but the only setting I find useful is full heat at full speed.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing negative for me to say.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend the Ovente X3.</li>
      <li>so dry time is an issue - I love this product!</li>
      <li>It works as strongly and as loud as the hair dryers in the salons.</li>
      <li>It dryies my hair super fast</li>
      <li>I have purchased another Andis (lower end model than last time) because I want a dryer with more range than just one useful setting for me.  </li>
      <li>I suppose the reason for that may be that with the super fast air flow nobody would burn themselves accidentally.  </li>
      <li>I am able to dry my hair faster, this dryer is simple, powerful and it&#x27;s easy to handle!</li>
      <li>is too hot for a 4 lb.</li>
      <li>I think it is too dangerously hot.</li>
      <li>Lots of power, gets really hot, does not overheat.  </li>
      <li>Love this mid price dryer.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>, it , I also was very happy with it, relatively quit (compared to similar products) long cord.  </li>
      <li>I remind you that I only use this full blast full heat now.  </li>
      <li>Shipment was fast, i will most definitely purchase again.  </li>
      <li>The higher the wattage, the more air it can move around...and that means faster dry times.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It must run at the highest air flow level to get the highest heat safely from the dryer but do not aim it directly at your ears for long while on full blast.  </li>
      <li>The rubber grip on the back side of the handle tends to fall off easily.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product , it&#x27;s hot, powerful and will dry your hair quickly.</li>
      <li>Dries my hair fast.  </li>
      <li>I have very stubborn curly hair</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s probably why my hair dries so fast.  </li>
      <li>and it works very well on my hair</li>
      <li>This was my first &#x27;expensive&#x27; dryer, and I was very happy with it initially.</li>
      <li>When the air flow is at max and the heat full up, only then the dryer gets real hot and safe because the jet blast is so hard.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this dryer, adn the shipping was fast, too.</li>
      <li>I was searching in Amazon for a hair dryer after 2 died on us within teh first year of purchase and was surprised to find a 110V version of Ovente.  </li>
      <li>The lower fan with higher heat setting may not please others that need this for styling because it will cook your hair if you don&#x27;t keep it far away.</li>
      <li>, highly recommend it</li>
      <li>The hair dryer had great power and dried my hair really fast; however, it caught fire in less than a month.  </li>
      <li>Now I don&#x27;t know if I prefer the Andis over the super fast dry from this.  </li>
      <li>Too low to be useful for anything.  </li>
      <li>so I guess it fulfills my needs even faster than normal.  </li>
      <li>Normally I would have rated this 2 stars</li>
      <li>Very light weight and quiet, but controls are on the handle and are sharp... have to hold it at the very bottom of the handle so not to switch the settings, and smells like burning plastic...</li>
      <li>Works great but a little heavy.</li>
      <li>The sellers are sending Andis models to where I live again.  </li>
      <li>I list below but the Andis is hotter at all settings  but the air flows are set correctly and I would have got that again except they wouldn&#x27;t ship where I live (at the time I had to replace dryers)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the 150 dollar models I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s simply too hot.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it most everyday for 3 years and If this one ever goes out I will be heading straight back here to purchase another!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a professional hair dryer for styling</li>
      <li>It is lake a professional hair dryer, with AC motor, 2200 W and tourmalina.</li>
      <li>I swear my shoulder length hair dries completely in under 4 minutes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is quiet, really quiet for a powerful dryer.  </li>
      <li>I put it down in my bathroom, let it cool, then threw it away and went to WalMart.  </li>
      <li>Whatever they did, I get my hair dry so fast on the super hot super fast speed its crazy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hair dryer blew up the third time I used it!</li>
    <li> Dries my hair fast.  Love this blow dryer</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money, less than two months and stopped working</li>
    <li> I think I was fooled by the \\&quot;Super Salon\\&quot; and \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; in the name, or because the original price was $200 (I easily get sucked in by great deals).  Even though the product says it is 2800-watt, I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference between this one and my good old ConAir from Walmart.  The hair dryer always made a weird noise, which was even worse when I would turn the hair dryer upside down.  About a month after I received it, I was blow drying my hair when I noticed this horrible burning smell.  My hair dyer was smoking!!!  I thought it was about to catch on fire -- I put it down in my bathroom, let it cool, then threw it away and went to WalMart.  I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with natural (non chemically treated) hair. This dryer dries my shoulder length, thick hair in 10 minutes. I use this with my Denman hairbrush and it straightens my hair well. If I want my hair to resemble yaki texture/straight hair, I simply flat iron it (about a 20 minute process) and I&#x27;m good to go. I did a few months of research before finally deciding to purchase this dryer. I am very satisfied with my decision. This is the first time that I have been satisfied with  my \\&quot;at home\\&quot; hair results. You know a dryer is the real deal when it includes a disclaimer that reads, \\&quot;do not use on small children or invalids\\&quot;!!!</li>
    <li> I suggest you don&#x27;t waste your cash on those expensive hair dryers when you can buy this one.  It comes in the ceramic/tourmaline design that is popular now, but more importantly, this dryer&#x27;s wattage is much higher than most hair dryers out there (and I&#x27;ve looked!).  The higher the wattage, the more air it can move around...and that means faster dry times.  I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times, so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Very powerful hairdryer just be careful how you wield this bad boy or you may end up tangling up your hair. Go down the hair shaft not up! Overall I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is the second one we have mine is still going strong after two and a half years...and my daughters bombed out after 2 months and we have to get it replaced</li>
    <li> The hair dryer worked very well, until the cool shot button got stuck and now there is only cold air emitted. Next, the hair dryer kept tripping the circuit  and blowing the circuit. It&#x27;s a shame since the dryer was quick. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you want to replace your hair dryer in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This is an amazingly sturdy and powerful hair dryer.  Really dries my hair quickly and allows for easy styling.  This one should last me a long time.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer had great power and dried my hair really fast; however, it caught fire in less than a month.  I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> It works as strongly and as loud as the hair dryers in the salons. I have very stubborn curly hair and it works very well on my hair</li>
    <li> I (originally) ended up rating this 3 stars only because it dries my shoulder length hair so fast at top speed and top heat. Normally I would have rated this 2 stars but this thing blows everything away on drying speed but only on the fastest and hottest settings. This model puts out a very low heat at the the low setting either air speed.  Too low to be useful for anything.  On the other end you can cook your hair or self at the higher temperature and maybe even hurt your hearing if you are not careful.  The lower fan with higher heat setting may not please others that need this for styling because it will cook your hair if you don&#x27;t keep it far away. At low flow on high heat I think it is too dangerously hot. When the air flow is at max and the heat full up, only then the dryer gets real hot and safe because the jet blast is so hard.  I suppose the reason for that may be that with the super fast air flow nobody would burn themselves accidentally.  Whatever they did, I get my hair dry so fast on the super hot super fast speed its crazy.  I swear my shoulder length hair dries completely in under 4 minutes.  I only use it at max/max for me and at slow/low it is too weak and not hot enough to dry my dog and low speed hot is too hot for a 4 lb. dog.  At full speed this thing has a very powerful flow of air and is also Jet engine fast and cannot be used on my dog which is 1/2 the reason for me needing the dryer.  The low speed high heat would cook my dog and me. This dryer is smaller and lighter than the Andis 82005 Pro I list below but the Andis is hotter at all settings  but the air flows are set correctly and I would have got that again except they wouldn&#x27;t ship where I live (at the time I had to replace dryers) so I got this instead. I would have preferred to buy the Andis 82005 Pro again instead of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must run at the highest air flow level to get the highest heat safely from the dryer but do not aim it directly at your ears for long while on full blast.  This thing BLASTS the air out and the flow is so strong it could damage your ear if aimed improperly either by air pressure or noise from the airflow over the ear. That&#x27;s probably why my hair dries so fast.  I&#x27;ve only been using this 2 weeks now so I&#x27;ll give the long run rating later.  What I do wish this dryer would do is dry at a higher heat on low heat and low air flow.  It&#x27;s too weak for me otherwise as I don&#x27;t do styling or anything like that.  On low speed high heat it&#x27;s simply too hot.  I just dry my hair without styling so I guess it fulfills my needs even faster than normal.  I prefer the lower settings on the Andis for my dog and since I buy for my use and my dog&#x27;s this doesn&#x27;t fulfill my needs for use with my pooch.  Its not hot enough on the lower heat for a professional dryer.  I remind you that I only use this full blast full heat now.  This dryer could have gotten more stars from me but the only setting I find useful is full heat at full speed.  Anything else seems useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Andis 82005 Pro was a great dryer but was bigger and heavier than this one.  I used it (the Andis) about 2 to 3 times a week for 2 years.  The sucker died right after the 2 year mark.  The electric safety plug bit the dust.  I would have bought that one or a better Andis in a heartbeat instead this one but they won&#x27;t ship Andis here any more.  They&#x27;ll only ship this and and some other crud brands :( here now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/24/13 Its later.  I have purchased another Andis (lower end model than last time) because I want a dryer with more range than just one useful setting for me.  The sellers are sending Andis models to where I live again.  Now I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this Ovente X3 and I&#x27;ll be donating it to a shelter to someone who needs a hair dryer and can&#x27;t afford one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/28/13  I got the Andis a few days ago.  Now I don&#x27;t know if I prefer the Andis over the super fast dry from this.  The Andis has many better heat options but I think the speedin drying has me spoiled.  I guess I need to change my rating to 4 stars for speed in drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I forgot to mention that this item was either never submitted to Underwriter Laboratories or failed the UL seal of approval.in drying has me spoiled.  I guess I need to change my rating to 4 stars for speed in drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I forgot to mention that this item was either never submitted to Underwriter Laboratories or failed the UL seal of approval.</li>
    <li> While overseas I had the same one  which was 220V it worked great for us and my wife who has long hair loved it, it , I also was very happy with it, relatively quit (compared to similar products) long cord.  I was searching in Amazon for a hair dryer after 2 died on us within teh first year of purchase and was surprised to find a 110V version of Ovente.  It arrived promptly and it is the same great quality as the on ewe had overseas only 110V.  This is a salon type product and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> If you buy this unit be advised that you might need to to some repair work to fix quality issues. The filter on the intake end of the blower came off repeately on my dryer after a short time om my dryer. It wont screw down tight and stay put: You can fix that with PVC glue. Unscrew and remove the screen/flange then put the glue on the threads of the dryer and  screw the flange back on. You wont be able to unscew the filter screen after that; but doing this will keep it from falling off. The switches on the handle are positioned so that the unit must be gripped gingerly or the switches will accidently get switched by the grip of your hand. You can fix that by grinding the paddles on the switches down to about flush with the surface they extend from. I used a Dremel Moto-Tool for this. Doing this makes them harder to turn off an on, but after that the switched won&#x27;t poke the palm of your hand or get switched accidently. THe motor/fan assembly became dismouned in my uinit after I had used it a few months.  This causes a loud hi piched scream as the fan, when not monted properly, toutches parts on the inside of the unit as it spins.You can fix that by removing the back/housing and remounting  the assembly using larger screws. Two screws are needed. Go to the hardware store and get some of the same length but the next larger size in diamater.  Make sure that the ears on the fan assembly didn&#x27;t come from the factory bent, as mine were. Re-mountung with bent ears may require you to repeat the process later as ears that are not flat will cause the assembly to fall off again. That is the mistake I made and today I had to re-mount the fan for a seconf time. The rubber grip on the back side of the handle tends to fall off easily. You can fix that by gluing it back on. I have done this with my unit. Make sure to  used glue that isnt too strong because you have to remove this piece to fix anything inside the unit. I believe Revlon has a dryer like this that has no issues. A friend had a Revlon and never had any trouble.</li>
    <li> Does what it claims.  Lots of power, gets really hot, does not overheat.  I have very curly long hair and usually takes an hour to blow out straight.  Reduced time by about 15 min.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair quickly.  Only 4 stars because once in a while, the power switch does not turn the unit off--have to play with the switch to make it work.</li>
    <li> This was my first &#x27;expensive&#x27; dryer, and I was very happy with it initially. After 3 months, the Speed setting stopped working - the dryer only works on HIGH now. Manufacturer&#x27;s website has no information about warranty. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> is your product bevolt? Can I use it in Brazil that the voltage is 220V</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with blow dryer. Shipment was fast, i will most definitely purchase again.  The blow dryer came with  extra gifts and in two convenient travel cases.</li>
    <li> the price for this product was so high for the quality, and the function of the machine is so basic compare to its advertising, not worthy</li>
    <li> the design is simple and nothing special but it is damn powerful and works great. that is all you need from a blow dryer!!</li>

    <li> I recommend this product , it&#x27;s hot, powerful and will dry your hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Very light weight and quiet, but controls are on the handle and are sharp... have to hold it at the very bottom of the handle so not to switch the settings, and smells like burning plastic...</li>
    <li> I just love it. I was looking for a professional hair dryer for styling and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. The heat is just perfect and it keeps the hair shiny.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazinngggggggg ... Very strong heat and my hair is done so quickly&lt;br /&gt;I have a very kinky hair and so hard to style , but with this hair dryer it&#x27;s as if I went to the salon, highly recommend it</li>

    <li> I am able to dry my hair faster, this dryer is simple, powerful and it&#x27;s easy to handle! Love it!</li>
    <li> I wish I saved the box for this dryer so I can return this dryer. It is so heavy and very difficult to hold when trying to dry my hair.  Also I don&#x27;t think it has the ionic drying it claims to have.</li>
    <li> Exceptional dryer...I love this hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet, really quiet for a powerful dryer.  It&#x27;s comfortable to use/hold.&lt;br /&gt;I am really glad I chose this one.

    <li> This blow dryer is the best I have ever bought. It dryies my hair super fast and I dont even need a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome it cuts my drying time in half.</li>
    <li> This item showed up as advertised, and works great.  It&#x27;s crazy how fast that it dries your hair.  I highly recommend this dryer, adn the shipping was fast, too.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful, quick, perfect hair dryer. Definitely recommend it for salon professionals. The price is unreal ... It&#x27;s better than the 150 dollar models I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer was really good at first. It has a great power and it worked like a professional hairdryer which you can find in a hair saloon. But tonight, while my wife was using it as usual, it exploded in my wifes hand. Although it did not cause any injury (thankfully) you can see that it is pulled apart slightly at the connecting edges. And although it might sound crazy, i tried to make it work again (i put it on the floor of course) it did not work. I am going to try to return it to amazon. I will post updates here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 minutes edit: After Finding out that the return period is over for this product, I had a quick chat with amazon representative and they were able to provide me with a return label for full refund as an exception. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this mid price dryer. It is the most powerful available which cuts drying time. It&#x27;s not to heavy or loud. Overall great hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: Almost 3 years after purchasing this dryer it is still working as well as the day I got it! I&#x27;ve used it most everyday for 3 years and If this one ever goes out I will be heading straight back here to purchase another! Great hair dryer!**</li>
