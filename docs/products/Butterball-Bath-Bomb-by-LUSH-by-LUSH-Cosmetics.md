### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They smell so wonderful, great gift soaps!!</li>
      <li>This one is the best.</li>
      <li>Priceless...</li>
      <li>The moisturizing effect on the water is brilliant, but if I want that, I&#x27;ll go find a bath melt with a scent I like.</li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>This was also a gift to my great granddaughter and she loves soaking in the bath.  </li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>but it works great despite the size.</li>
      <li>Bath bombs are the greatest thing ever invented :).  </li>
      <li>Yes my skin felt great afterward and it smelled good</li>
      <li>The aroma is pleasant and buttery but not in that \\&quot;oh</li>
      <li>This bath bomb should be nominated for Best Supporting Cast!!    </li>
      <li>If you like milder scents and warm baths this would be good for you.</li>
      <li>The first one I tried was the Sex bomb which was awesome.  </li>
      <li>but I think I like Dream On more than Butterball, although the fragrant water was pretty impressive.</li>
      <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t very strong.  </li>
      <li>Experience LUSH soap and be delighted!!  </li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t change your bath water color but you can see the melted butters floating, on that note make sure to rinse your tub afterwards</li>
      <li>bath product won&#x27;t change the color of your bath water, but it will perfume the water like an invisible field of exotic flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will buy her some more.</li>
      <li>I love the bath bomb but in the stores its not 17 dollars...</li>
      <li>This one moisturizes and the smell is ok while in the tub..</li>
      <li>I think some color might make it a bit better experience...</li>
      <li>The Butterball smells gorgeous and adds just the right amount of moisturizer to bath.</li>
      <li>The coco butter melts at rather warm temperatures, so if you prefer a lukewarm or cool bath there are slivers of coco butter floating around.</li>
      <li>Great and fun lovely feeling very soothing skin!</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loved the scent so much from the butter, that it made him hungry.</li>
      <li>This is a bomb best used with other bombs, bubble bars, or bath melts.</li>
      <li>It is a smaller bath bomb but it made my bath waters and my skin silky, the smell was mild but very pleasant.</li>
      <li>LUSH soaps are very special and so very creative.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>These are so FANTASTIC</li>
      <li>This one has a rich vanilla buttery scent, it was so wonderful in the tub and left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is my very favorite bath bomb from Lush.  </li>
      <li>Picked this one up at the store, loved it&#x27;s scent, and since it&#x27;s smaller then the others, I got two.</li>
      <li>I found the scent to be very mild, but it was very moisturizing to my skin.</li>
      <li>- how many times do I want to spend five dollars or more for a single bath?</li>
      <li>It definitely leaves the water softened and silky, and I got out of the bath feeling nicely moisturized but not as if I was coated in oil.</li>
      <li>But for an occasional treat, this one is nice and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
      <li>This is not one of Lush&#x27;s more exciting bombs: It&#x27;s meant to relax with and is good for a before-bed bath when you want to wind down, not gear up.</li>
      <li>I like most of Lush&#x27;s bath bombs, but I don&#x27;t like this one, purely because of the scent.  </li>
      <li>My skin was SO SOFT and smooth afterward</li>
      <li>Of all the LUSH bath bombs I&#x27;ve tried, this one is probably my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>Butterball is by far one of my favorite lush bombs.</li>
      <li>Anything by LUSH is going to be worth it.  </li>
      <li>Very relaxing.</li>
      <li>now I&#x27;m hungry!\\&quot; sort of way that some products that smell too much like food can be.</li>
      <li>I have tried most of the other bath bombs</li>
      <li>If you have tried Dream On, this is a little less moisturizing, but may seem perfect on a day when you want a bath without leaves, flowers, coloring of any kind, bits of seaweed or any such annoyance that may not bother you on any other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So,</li>
      <li>I find the scent to be both musky and overly sweet, so it&#x27;s animalistic and smells of a bakery at the same time.  </li>
      <li>This bath bomb is very highly regarded by a young family member.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a soft scent that lingers without being overpowering and it really really softens skin.</li>
      <li>I also liked that this bomb isn&#x27;t full of \\&quot;junk\\&quot; like some other LUSH bath bombs that require cleaning up the mess in the bathtub afterward, or placing them in a stocking before use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it made your skin very soft.</li>
      <li>SILKY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was under the impression that the bomb didn&#x27;t work, because there was no fizz and the water was clear, but i came out and my skin was shining!</li>
      <li>A lesson learned never buy these types of products from other than the original manufacturer.</li>
      <li>If you aren&#x27;t a huge fan of the overly-perfumey then you could try this one with a little of your favourite bath oil or salt</li>
      <li>Not so all the Lush products I purchased were All old and the fragrance was almost non existing.</li>
      <li>I have been a customer of Lush products for some time now .</li>
      <li>LUSH on Amazon....</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and its fragrance lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>I ended up taking a shower after but still had soft skin. . .</li>
      <li>But, it did make my skin SOO SOFT AND</li>
      <li>My favorites are still Think Pink, Youki Hi, Dream On, Golden Slumbers, Ne Worry Pas and Romance</li>
      <li>However, it made the bath water very soft and silky and it was a relaxing soak in general.</li>
      <li>Especially if you don&#x27;t live near one!  </li>
      <li>This is my second ever Lush bath bomb.  </li>
      <li>Instant soft and silky.     </li>
      <li>Butterball is one of Lush&#x27;s smaller bath bombs.</li>
      <li>Left my skin soft, but not greasy.</li>
      <li>this little guy is fantastic when combo&#x27;ed with any other ones from Lush.     </li>
      <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t very strong and smelled faintly of confectioners sugar and vanilla.</li>
      <li>First off I&#x27;m in love with Butterball, not only is it extremely moisturizing with its little chunks of cocoa butter infused in the bomb; it also leaves a soft scent of vanilla and floral behind.</li>

<li> I try to keep a few on hand in case I need to be forgiven for something.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a huge bath fan (and neither is she)</li>
<li> The delicate fragrance is a blend of synthetic musk, ylang ylang oil and other perfumes.</li>
<li> But this price is a little crazy considering its $5 in stores and on the lush website.</li>
<li> The bomb I received was very small in comparison to other bombs I purchased in the past.</li>
<li> Word of Caution:  This will leave a slight tub residue behind and may make your tub slippery.</li>

    <li> The Butterball smells gorgeous and adds just the right amount of moisturizer to bath. Left my skin soft, but not greasy. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Butterball is one of Lush&#x27;s smaller bath bombs. I found the scent to be very mild, but it was very moisturizing to my skin. The coco butter melts at rather warm temperatures, so if you prefer a lukewarm or cool bath there are slivers of coco butter floating around. I found the scent didn&#x27;t linger at all. There wasn&#x27;t any color change that I noticed but it did leave a thin film I had to clean off. Butterball doesn&#x27;t break down well, I found half of it is not enough for a standard bath. Compared to Lush&#x27;s other bath bombs, I found Butterball to be just so-so. If you like milder scents and warm baths this would be good for you.</li>
    <li> This is my second ever Lush bath bomb.  The first one I tried was the Sex bomb which was awesome.  This one moisturizes and the smell is ok while in the tub.. but after you dry off the lingering smell is gross.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it.. to me it smells like cooking oil.  Definitely not purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite bath bomb from Lush.  My skin feels so soft and its fragrance lasts all day.  I just wish that there were other products with the same scent.</li>
    <li> I have tried most of the other bath bombs but I keep going back to this one.  It leaves your skin smooth and silky. I don&#x27;t even know why I ever try the other ones at this point.  This one is the best.</li>
    <li> Picked this one up at the store, loved it&#x27;s scent, and since it&#x27;s smaller then the others, I got two. This one has a rich vanilla buttery scent, it was so wonderful in the tub and left my skin soft and smooth. My boyfriend loved the scent so much from the butter, that it made him hungry.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these.  I try to keep a few on hand in case I need to be forgiven for something.</li>
    <li> This bath bomb should be nominated for Best Supporting Cast!!    Not to be used alone (at leats in my house)... this little guy is fantastic when combo&#x27;ed with any other ones from Lush.     If you have dry winter skin, pick a bath bomb you like the smell of, and pop a Butterball in with it. BAM! Instant soft and silky.     If you aren&#x27;t a huge fan of the overly-perfumey then you could try this one with a little of your favourite bath oil or salt and it would work just as well.</li>
    <li> I like most of Lush&#x27;s bath bombs, but I don&#x27;t like this one, purely because of the scent.  I find the scent to be both musky and overly sweet, so it&#x27;s animalistic and smells of a bakery at the same time.  The moisturizing effect on the water is brilliant, but if I want that, I&#x27;ll go find a bath melt with a scent I like.</li>
    <li> I never take bath&#x27;s anymore, and i was going away for a birthday party weekend and i heard a bunch about these bath Bomb&#x27;s! So, i got it and tried it and i must say..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it didn&#x27;t do that Big Fizz thing everyone talks about... But, it did make my skin SOO SOFT AND SILKY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was under the impression that the bomb didn&#x27;t work, because there was no fizz and the water was clear, but i came out and my skin was shining! I loved it!</li>
    <li> If you have tried Dream On, this is a little less moisturizing, but may seem perfect on a day when you want a bath without leaves, flowers, coloring of any kind, bits of seaweed or any such annoyance that may not bother you on any other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this completely white (not yellow as pictured) bath product won&#x27;t change the color of your bath water, but it will perfume the water like an invisible field of exotic flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spending about 20 minutes in the bath is all it takes to moisturize you all over. The delicate fragrance is a blend of synthetic musk, ylang ylang oil and other perfumes. The catalog states that this has vanilla in it, but I don&#x27;t see it in the list of ingredients and maybe that is considered part of the perfume ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I felt this was a relaxing bath with moisturizing qualities but I think I like Dream On more than Butterball, although the fragrant water was pretty impressive. My favorites are still Think Pink, Youki Hi, Dream On, Golden Slumbers, Ne Worry Pas and Romance In a Stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> This is not one of Lush&#x27;s more exciting bombs: It&#x27;s meant to relax with and is good for a before-bed bath when you want to wind down, not gear up. It&#x27;s smaller than All That Jasmine (about the size of a plum rather than a baseball), which was a surprise but it works great despite the size. It&#x27;s got a soft scent that lingers without being overpowering and it really really softens skin. I think some color might make it a bit better experience... as it is it just sort of clouds up the water a little.</li>
    <li> The bomb I received was very small in comparison to other bombs I purchased in the past. The smell wasn&#x27;t very strong and smelled faintly of confectioners sugar and vanilla. It turned the bath milky and I couldn&#x27;t smell anything at all once it had fizzed up. However, it made the bath water very soft and silky and it was a relaxing soak in general. My skin was SO SOFT and smooth afterward and I was so moisturized that I didn&#x27;t even need to put a lotion on!  This is a bomb best used with other bombs, bubble bars, or bath melts.</li>
    <li> Experience LUSH soap and be delighted!!  This bath bomb is very highly regarded by a young family member.  LUSH soaps are very special and so very creative.  They smell so wonderful, great gift soaps!!</li>
    <li> Great and fun lovely feeling very soothing skin!</li>
    <li> It is a smaller bath bomb but it made my bath waters and my skin silky, the smell was mild but very pleasant. This one doesn&#x27;t change your bath water color but you can see the melted butters floating, on that note make sure to rinse your tub afterwards or you may get an oil ring.</li>
    <li> Yes my skin felt great afterward and it smelled good but this was still not worth $17+</li>
    <li> I love the bath bomb but in the stores its not 17 dollars...</li>
    <li> I have been a customer of Lush products for some time now . I had to purchase some products at the last minute and as a Prime member could still get them overnight. As we never have any issues with Amazon I believed this to would be alright. Not so all the Lush products I purchased were All old and the fragrance was almost non existing. A lesson learned never buy these types of products from other than the original manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge bath fan (and neither is she) but this definitely makes for a relaxing soak.  I ended up taking a shower after but still had soft skin. . . lol</li>
    <li> Anything by LUSH is going to be worth it.  Bath bombs are the greatest thing ever invented :).  LUSH on Amazon....Priceless...hehe.  Especially if you don&#x27;t live near one!  These are so FANTASTIC</li>
    <li> Butterball is by far one of my favorite lush bombs. It&#x27;s simple but so moisturizing. But this price is a little crazy considering its $5 in stores and on the lush website.</li>
