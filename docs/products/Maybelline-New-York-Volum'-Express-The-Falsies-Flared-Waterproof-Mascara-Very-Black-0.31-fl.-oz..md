<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They don&#x27;t call it Falsies for nothing!!!!</li>
    <li> its great it even gets my small lashes longer, the ones near my tear ducts, its fantastic maybelline keep on doing what you do</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried very expensive mascara before from brands like Dior, Clinique, Clarins and this is still my favorite. I apply 2-3 coats, makes My eyelashes full, thick, long and fabulous.</li>
    <li> Love that it is water proof.  Has a great brush.</li>
    <li> Very clumpy and dried out. But was shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I purchased Maybelline New York Volum&#x27; Express Waterproof mascara, Brown/black, locally for $5. I don&#x27;t like it. It has clumped each time I used it. It&#x27;s hard to get my lashes to look full because they&#x27;re too clumpy. The brush is gently curved &amp; very flexible. The most flexible mascara wand I&#x27;ve ever used. All mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past will clean the brush off as you pull the wand out of the tube. The opening is too big in the Volum&#x27; Express tube so the excess mascara isn&#x27;t removed from the brush which might be the reason for the clumping. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is waterproof as advertised. I use baby oil to remove waterproof mascara; petroleum jelly will work too.</li>
    <li> excellent - just as described and fast</li>
    <li> Really great product will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use this product in a couple years but I love it. I already have long eyelashes,this product brings them out more.</li>
    <li> this is not my favorite mascara, I have a few brands I prefer over this, just bought this one yesterday and tried it today it was slightly clumpy right out of the tube and also made my lashes stick together, it did accomplish making my lashes look longer but overall I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I like this product. My only complaint is that it seems to be running out of the schtuff and I only just started using it!</li>
    <li> This was by far the worst mascara I have ever used! I was just wearing it around the house &amp; it was flaking and smearing &amp; very hard to get off. It was not even easy to put on, it was very clumpy and it would smear on my eye lids &amp; under my eyes. I looked like a raccoon even before I was done applying it! What a huge waste of money! Very Disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added Note: I tried to use the mascara again, I figured Maybelline would not possibly put out such a mess of a product! This time, I wiped the wand off to get any extra makeup off of it, I figured if I started out with a clean wand, maybe it would go on better &amp; not flake &amp; smudge as much!  I was WRONG!  This stuff is Horrible! It says it&#x27;s waterproof, well, that part is true, now I have raccoon eyes &amp; the junk won&#x27;t come off!  I think it would only be fair if this company would replace this crap with a better mascara! I know that there are many, many more out there for much less than I paid for the so called \\&quot;falsies\\&quot;..which if you ask me, is totally misleading &amp; false advertising!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and it works very well.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are short, fine, and stick-straight.  Mascara and I have never been friends because they don&#x27;t hold curl well (what curl I can manage to get without pinching my eyelid, which admittedly isn&#x27;t much), and I had basically resigned myself to having to learn how to apply false lashes.  But the Falsies lived up to its name; I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it&#x27;s made for me.  One coat is enough to make my lashes actually visible, and it holds curl all day.  Usually I put on one or two coats, which is subtle enough for my natural-makeup style but still very enhancing.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, and my lashes tend to clump easily.  No problems with fallout either, even with multiple coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for waterproof...Just to test it out one night, I took my shower with the mascara still on.  I like hot showers, and I was in for about 45 minutes.  Got out, and the mascara was STILL there.  It had washed off the ends a bit, but there was still plenty on down to the roots, even enough to continue holding some of my curl!  My eye makeup remover does take it off, but I have to put some effort into it.  This stuff isn&#x27;t coming off unless you want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size of the brush, which is pretty large in comparison to my teeny-tiny lashes.  But as long as I&#x27;m careful I&#x27;ve had no problems with application, so I won&#x27;t even knock off a star.  I don&#x27;t foresee the brush size being a problem for most people; it&#x27;s not unusually large by any means.  (Nothing but those microcara brushes are actually small enough to be proportionate to my lashes, seriously.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> This mascara is terrific! It works well especially for my lower eyelashes. It really makes it look as if I was wearing false eyelashes on my lower lashes. For upper lashes it still works very well, and it IS very waterproof! It would not come off easily even when I remove my makeup with makeup remover, much less with just water (but don&#x27;t worry, it DOES come off with makeup remover if you work on it patiently for a few more moments and gentle rubbing; I use a water-based makeup remover). One satisfied customer here and will be coming back for more!</li>
    <li> This is a nice mascara but I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t live up to some of the advertising hype.  I bought this for my daughter and tried it myself and you get good coverage, and a nice build up, but you have to do multiple coats in a row, without letting your lashes dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Quick Notes:&lt;br /&gt;--As another reviewer noted, this product is very waterproof.  My other mascaras I can remove with a mild soap and water.  Not so with \\&quot;Falsies\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I found this product irritated my eyes and I had to discontinue using it.  BUT I have to say that I have bad allergies and I&#x27;m probably more sensitive to irritants than most people.  In fact, I have to use waterproof mascara because even the ultra-tested doctor-recommended eye products irritate my eyes.  I only add this warning just in case you are even more sensitive than I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product.  My daughter gets good results and the mascara doesn&#x27;t smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~&lt;br /&gt;mom</li>
    <li> Maybelline has, hands down, the best mascara! I absolutely love Falsies!!!! Your eyelashes don&#x27;t clump and it just gives them amazing lengths. Its one of my favorite mascaras. You will love yourself for making this purchase!</li>
    <li> I think some of you might like this mascara but it just wasn&#x27;t my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen any ads for this or at least remember seeing them before buying this so I don&#x27;t know what the claims were. Heck, I didn&#x27;t even read the description on the packaging. But seeing the words Falsies and Volum just tells you what to expect. So I got this considering that most of my favorite mascara&#x27;s are Maybelline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*First looking at the brush, which I did not see a sample of at Target, it&#x27;s a skinny brush which easily told me the results I was gonna have. It&#x27;s like a longer version of the Great Lash wand. It also flexes a bit towards the brush which I don&#x27;t really love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The formula or the product is more wet than the other mascaras. And I think that and the brush sort of makes for a messier application. At least for me. I was able to get some length with just one coat and it glided really easily, but I ended up getting a messy eye liner..you know when you apply mascara and some of it gets on your lash line. Kind of cool like it&#x27;s a two in one, but not really fun. haha.  That always happens but this time it was way more messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It definitely lengthens your lashes but they look long and skinny, almost kind of spidery or daddy long legs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Adds SOME volume. I&#x27;m used to and prefer the effect I get with the Colassal (the regular one and the Pumped in the pink tube) which will grab just about all your lashes making them look like you have false lashes on. It&#x27;s funny that this mascara is called Falsies but in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t look like falsies..but the other mascaras (the Colassal) do. Weird?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It separates lashes but  it also does clump in some places&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Since I got this in the Waterproof formula, it was definitely waterproof. I don&#x27;t always use an eye makeup remover even with waterproof products, but this one would leave some gunk behind so you&#x27;d definitely need an oil based makeup remover for this one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this might work out for some of you guys. I prefer a full looking lash and use the Colossal and the Pumped Up Colossal which works out for me.  I think Falsies is more like the Great Lash mascara with more lengthening. But it wont really shape em up or make them look too full or voluminous.r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this might work out for some of you guys. I prefer a full looking lash and use the Colossal and the Pumped Up Colossal which works out for me.  I think Falsies is more like the Great Lash mascara with more lengthening. But it wont really shape em up or make them look too full or voluminous.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thin and short lashes that are completely straight; they might as well be invisible. After using this product, it looked as if I had long looking lashes. It does what any mascara should do. My lashes looked longer and fuller as if I had any. It&#x27;s waterproof is it&#x27;s a bit difficult to take off but nothing a bit of oil can&#x27;t solve. It amazes me how I actually look as if I had lashes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been meaning to get one of these, but with a hefty $12 price tag, I was hesitant to want to spend that much on -any- makeup product.  Fortunately for me, I found it on a super good sale at Target, AND had a coupon.  All together, I spent $4.00 on one, and LOVE it!    PROS:  1.  I love the color.  I got the darkest shade that Target had, and when it goes on it is so dark that my top eyelid looks almost like it has a layer of eyeliner on it.  I love the effect.  2.  It doesn&#x27;t clump.  There are bristles all the way around the wand, and even some on top.  No clumps, no nothing.  It was WONDERFUL!  3.  It IS waterproof (I tested it) which means it will be great for summer and winter wear.  I&#x27;ll never have to worry about raccoon eyes due to rain, again!  4.  It really does add a thicker, fuller look to lashes.  My eyelashes did NOT look fake (I wouldn&#x27;t want them to), but with just ONE application it appeared as though I had twice as many lashes as my normal eye.  I did a second coat after giving the first about a minute to dry, and they still didn&#x27;t look fake-- and my lashes were so long they hit my brow area, and my glasses, when I blinked!      CONS:  1.  The only con I have is that this product is SUPER waterproof.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of makeup removers because my face doesn&#x27;t handle the oils, and discovered with this product that soap and water does NOT work.  It took me a few minutes of warm water and soap to get it off, and even then I couldn&#x27;t get it all.  If you are going to use this product then you will DEFINITELY need to invest in some (good) makeup remover.      All things considering, I give this product 5 stars!  Its got great color, adds a unique new dimension, is waterproof, and appears to add a whole layer of lashes. I don&#x27;t mind it didn&#x27;t readily come off because I know I won&#x27;t have to worry about the mascara trailing during the day if I sweat, get wet, or it starts to rain.  For the $4 that I spent, I definitely plan to stock up and get another. I&#x27;d recommend this to ANY person looking for longer, fuller lashes.  If it can make a believer out of me, then I am sure it will do wonders for you. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this once and it came with the brush not attached to the stick, I ordered again and the same thing happened. Its made like crap!!! would never order again.</li>
    <li> Really I have never tried waterproof mascara, this is excellent makes your lashes longer lasts all day and night of course smudge proof.. Good to wear on a date when wathching mushy movies, if you cry don&#x27;t worry it still leaves you looking like a DOLL (:</li>
    <li> Its clumpy, the wand always has clumps.  worst ever</li>
    <li> Not my favorite mascara but it does the job.</li>
    <li> The waterproof version, which I bought at the drugstore, not here, is awful! Clumped my eyelashes together and took days and a lot of baby oil to remove it. Now my natural lashes are all thin and sparse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with the non-waterpoof kind: comes off easily with Ponds wipes and there&#x27;s only a little clumping sometimes which can usually be corrected.</li>
    <li> Finally.....this products really works!  I have skimpy eyelashes and this product builds them up, leaves no clumpy look and waterproof.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a bazillion kinds of mascara, so take my review with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I always use the same color: black, like my soul, so can&#x27;t really comment on how black varies from black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I guess it doesn&#x27;t clump. I haven&#x27;t noticed if it does. I should be more watchful, huh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t know about the waterproof aspect because I don&#x27;t cry or run around in sprinklers with it on. But when I take it off, I use those makeup wipes, and even the cheap brands remove it fine for me. I also can&#x27;t comment on how long it lasts, since it always comes off on my wipe, and when I wear makeup, I tend to fear for my eyeliner more than my mascara coming off (wow, I&#x27;m a horrible reviewer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I really like the curved shape. I don&#x27;t use too much makeup usually, so I was like, &amp;#34;What does the concave side do?&amp;#34; because I used the convex side for everything. But now I&#x27;ve decided without the confirmation of society that that&#x27;s the only side you need for life, because it makes applying the top and bottom lashes so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Sensitivity issues are for those who are sensitive. Which I am not. I don&#x27;t think. Wait. Dagnabit.</li>
    <li> It works, but I think the original falsies works better.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like all the &#x27;Falsies&#x27; products I have used, but I needed a waterproof kind this time, and the flared is pretty cool.  I am very satisfied and will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I liked the coverage but did need to reapply as the day went on. It irritated my eyes so I had to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> It took me a few uses to get used to the brush head of this applicator.  It has a bit of intentional wiggle to it and it seems to make the lashes look fuller by getting deeper in the lashes.  My lashes do look very long when I use this compared to my older mascara.  My one complaint is that it&#x27;s not as waterproof as I usually like.  If I get wet and then rub my eyes at all, it does smear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use an eyelash curler so I&#x27;m not sure how it would react to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will buy it again.  My current one has lasted four months and still has a lot of life in it.</li>
    <li> Good mascara. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> the price did not make me buy this, Its about the same price in stores. but I really like it and would buy it again. No clumps</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever.</li>
    <li> looks nice, stays on, and comes off fairly easy.</li>
    <li> I have fine lashes and I feel that I like other brands better because they seem to plump up my lashes better than this mascara did.</li>
    <li> Provides good volume but clumps too easily. I will probably not purchase again for this reason. Looking for something smoother.</li>
    <li> Buying this mascara was a waste of money. It clumps, and I don&#x27;t care how much you try to fix it, it turns out to be a big mess. It went in the garbage. I will stick with my Bare Minerals mascara.</li>
    <li> this product makes my short lashes look much longer. one coat is enough. i really like this and will order again.</li>
    <li> as expected and works great!</li>
    <li> First thing I have ever bought online. I love it! I will buy again. Stays on all day! I don&#x27;t have to worry about checking the mirror all the time to see if there is black stuff on my eye.</li>
    <li> not very much comes out of the tube. I wont be buying again. I&#x27;ll spend extra money for a better mascara</li>
    <li> Best mascara, with blonde lashes I need something that covers and stays on well. And it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s glued to your lashes. I&#x27;ve tried all the falsies versions and this one&#x27;s the best. And oddly, it actually smells really good. Weird I know!</li>
    <li> Maybe I misunderstood the product, but I thought this was a fiber lash that was supposed to add volume to my lashes. It does not. The brush does nothing to my uncurled lashes, but I&#x27;ve never found a brush shape that actually does anything other than coat my lashes, so maybe it&#x27;s me. I&#x27;ll stick with my L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous as it does a better job of making my real lashes look fuller. This Maybelline mascara is not a bad mascara, just not &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; or worth a change from your favorite.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product based on the reviews here.  I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed. The brush is flimsy, it doesn&#x27;t build up on my lashes at all. I won&#x27;t buy this again. It doesn&#x27;t compare to my smashbox mascara at all. For the proce though, I&#x27;m sure its better than others I&#x27;ve tried in that $5.00 price range.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a mascara I can switch to.  Now let&#x27;s hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it like they did Maybelline Marathon Waterproof.  That was my favorite, and I can&#x27;t find anything that compares for swimming!</li>
    <li> Having used Maybelline products for a \\&quot;certain\\&quot; number of years, I was pleased to find this one &amp; have used it since it&#x27;s inception. Love the product &amp; was delighted to find it on Amazon for about $2 LESS than at the dollar store &amp; much less than the drug or grocery store. Will be subscribing to this product. NOTE: it removes easily with non-oily eye makeup remover or baby oil, if you don&#x27;t mind oil.</li>
    <li> I like this product... it layers nicely and makes my lashes nice and thick without being clumpy.  I can cry and it does not run!</li>
    <li> Super deal;) it works really good too! I get tons of compliments</li>
    <li> the color is good. It just like what I want. I like it very much, and the price is lower.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be as described.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the wand or initial look with this mascara, but it wears off and does not last through the day for me.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this , would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product shipped very quickly and arrived before it was supposed to. I love this product, my lashes look gorgeous very happy with it.</li>
    <li> However, every one I&#x27;ve gotten through this subscription has lasted no more than a week.  It is dry in a week and I never had this problem in the past when I bought elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just cancelled the subscription.  I can&#x27;t understand why this is, unless these items are held by the seller in improper conditions or unless they&#x27;re past their date.  I&#x27;ll go back to buying at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m adding to the review.  I just realized that not only is there a problem with the mascara from this vendor, I&#x27;ve now paid for two tubes, FAR over what I&#x27;d pay elsewhere for one FRESH tube.  I cannot recommend this &#x27;deal&#x27; to anyone.</li>
    <li> Really love this mascara! It makes my eyelashes look thicker than it really is.</li>
    <li> Gives me beautiful defined lashes.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Exccelent&amp;#34;, that was my girlfriend said. She said this product durability its longer if you compare with another brands. I doesn&#x27;t understand nothing about this product. I&#x27;m just describing what she said.</li>
    <li> I am looking for a new mascara that is reasonably priced and easily available.  It seems my old kind was wearing off so quickly.  This kind definitely does last longer, which I appreciate!  My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t totally waterproof...at the beach (never even had my head in the water) it ended up running all over my face which looked rather scary.  I also don&#x27;t do a great job fully removing it at bedtime, and it will smear on my pillow.  So, not perfect but my favorite so far due to longer-lasting wear as well as price.</li>
    <li> This mascara is a great drugstore brand mascara.  I was having problems with it smearing under my eyes, but I think it was due to my eyelashes having residual coconut oil on them following me washing my face.  To remedy this, I just dab baby powder on my eyelashes prior to applying mascara, which works perfectly, and makes my lashes fuller. I usually only apply one coat and it lasts 16+ hours.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you would find in the store, just shipped to your house!</li>
    <li> I normally wear expensive mascara but always disappointed with the waterproof formula. This waterproof mascara lived up to its name. It stayed all day and even held up through a shower (I didn&#x27;t rub my eyes). I wore it the ocean and it didn&#x27;t smear till about four hours in so I thought it was great!</li>
    <li> IT NEVER COMES OFF.  Even with makeup remover it is a pain in the ass.</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of MAybelline Mascara and I think black drama is the best one. This one is good too but it just takes long time to shape your eye lashes</li>
    <li> Good product by a reputable company</li>
    <li> LOVE.THIS.STUFF. Never, ever, ever paying $30 for mascara ever again. This mascara does everything it says it will do - curl, separate, thicken, lengthen...without clumping or flaking. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and it&#x27;s only gotten on my eyelids during application once and that was simply because my 3 yo ran in the bathroom and yelled, &amp;#34;MAMA!&amp;#34; and I startled. :-) Also, the waterproof aspect is unmatched - something I&#x27;m always particular about.</li>
    <li> I have naturally long lashes and this makes my lashes look very long almost, fake, but I also use this after applying Maybelline Lash Stiletto and I then apply this on top.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Maybelline Collasal Cateye mascara.</li>
    <li> Good product but I have had much better eye mask</li>
    <li> My cousin said this is her favorite mascara, so I bought one to try it out. I like it. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up and when I do then it&#x27;s only occasionally, so I&#x27;m not the best judge of this... but I can say that it does look good on and is easy to apply and is comfortable. I liked this application brush much better than previous mascaras I have bought, so I will probably continue to buy just this one brand. It&#x27;s a curved brush with many narrow/tiny bristles that apply the mascara on much faster than brushes with thicker bristles.</li>
    <li> I have these on subscribe &amp; save and it costs about 2 bucks less than Walmart.  Separates lashes well and is waterproof.  Comes off clean with eye make up remover.  Not gunky at all.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This mascara is my favorite!! It really does flare my lashes out and no clumps, it washes off easily and the best part is the applicator does not pull too much through when applying. Lasts all day, very good purchase!!!</li>
    <li> so perfect! this mascara makes my eyelashes look so much more full and voluminous. I did have to curl my lashes before applying for the best result.</li>
    <li> My all time fav mascara.  No smears, no flakes, makes lashes look great!</li>
    <li> This is great mascara!  It doesn&#x27;t come off during the day and it is waterproof, which works great!</li>
    <li> It clumps a little bit, but it works realtively well and stays put throughout the day.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara thus far.  Having two brush sizes on one wand is helpful to get both length and thickness.</li>
    <li> This mascara is really waterproof. i cant even remove it with eye makeup remover and water :)) so if you are looking for really good waterproof mascara you can buy it</li>
    <li> Clumpy, extremely hard to get off with eye make up remover. Lashes felt hard and stiff. Not as expected.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this mascara. It is  not easy to apply. It goes on thick and clumpy and makes your lashes stick together and it is a pain in the butt to remove. I love Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash mascara and thought why not give this one a try and I regret making this purchase. Buy a different mascara. This one sucks.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, but hate paying in store prices. The amazon price is much better, and you get the same product. I have super thin lashes and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found so far that thickens them and holds reasonably. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This mascara is very waterproof and builds lashes well.  I am not an enormous eye makeup wearer ( I have decently long, dark lashes), but I bought this for my wedding, because photos really require it.  I&#x27;ve tried it a couple of times now, and it both wore well and stayed on without giving me raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> The tube was outdated dry out my wife was upset and the bad part about this product is you can&#x27;t return it. I have to check to see if I can get a refund. My wife said it&#x27;s a learning thing just go to CVS that way you can return.Please stop ripping  people off with this trash. Have a bad day</li>
    <li> I usually hate wearing mascara, so I was skeptical to try this. My eyelashes are plenty long on their own. I put it on the top lashes just to see how much more volume it gave them and I must say I was impressed. Normal mascara makes my lashes look inhuman and just plain weird. This stuff flared the ends and made them a tad darker so it did not look at all unusual. Even if you already have long and full lashes, try this. It will make your eyes pop without looking like a barbie doll.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Falsies for 2 or 3 years now and I love it. Definitely get some makeup wipes to remove it, your skin will thank you as it is pretty waterproof. I recommend starting at the base of your lashes and wiggling the wand as you move away from your eye, repeat that as needed and you&#x27;re good to go. This is probably one of the only mascaras that doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I need to curl my lashes first</li>
    <li> This mascara is one of my favorites.  It can be a little touchy and it will get clumpy if not applied properly. The trick is to apply the mascara in steady motions with the curve of the spoon brush lining up with the curve of your lashes. If applied to quickly or too slowly it will clump.  The achieved effect looks really cool and does look almost like fake lashes (in a good way).  For me, it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look thick, but rather long and disctinct which is a look that I prefer.  I get many compliments while wearing it.  It is not flawless, for sure, but for my purposes I have found no better product.</li>
    <li> Definitely hard to take off, kind of bothers my eyes towards the end of the day.</li>
    <li> wonderful product - very first time I wore a co worker of 2+ years said she never had noticed before how long my eyelashes were!</li>
    <li> One of the best drug store mascaras</li>
    <li> It dried out really quick, but I do like the way my lashes look.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Normally, I love this product. However, the product I received was all dry and clumpy! I can&#x27;t even use the product. I also can&#x27;t even return this product because of Amazon&#x27;s rules about not being allowed to return items with flammable liquid or whatever. Don&#x27;t waste your money on Amazon. Go to the store and buy it. I have no idea how old the mascara I received was, but it must have been pretty old to be all dry the first time I opened it. Don&#x27;t waste your money here. You&#x27;ll get an ancient product from Amazon. At least you know its newer at the store and you can always return it if its bad, even though its more expensive there. Again, DO NOT BUY OFF OF AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for myself, my daughter and grand daughter...  We all like it</li>
    <li> It gives me long lashes without looking like I caked it on. Without it you cannot tell I have eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Best waterproof mascara that I&#x27;ve found. I have always loyally used, &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real,&amp;#34; by Benefit, but recently, for some reason, it started to leave little dark smudges under my eyes. I wanted a waterproof mascara that was relatively easy to remove, I&#x27;ve tried a dozen other brands and was skeptical about this one. This mascara had the highest reviews on Amazon, so I bought it. Now I see why. I am converted. I love Falsies!</li>
    <li> The best!!! Makes my eyes look alive n fresh! Best mascara I have ever tried:)it&#x27;s definitely waterproof. No messy smudges</li>
    <li> Not really over whelmed.  Its is okay.  I have found I like the brush on Colossal Lash better.  But it shipped fast and was a good price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t run or clump - but doesn&#x27;t lengthen like I&#x27;d hoped.  No trouble wearing it with my contacts.  Might buy again since it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I will not buy this again. I usually like the brand, but havent tried this version. Not sure if it is how it is supposed to be or a bad/old item. But it seemed old...and for water proof it smudged. I will stick to the other versions of Maybelline or other brands... may try this again from a store, only because I have hear of older products being shipped. I love my make up stores with quality product and easy exchange</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara! I purchased it for my trip to Puerto Rico to withstand the salt water from the sea and it surpassed my expectations! It really is amazing. It makes your eyelashes look great and it stays all day. My only problem is that it is hard to take off even with makeup towelettes but that&#x27;s something I can deal with when it offers all day at the ocean coverage.</li>
    <li> This is ok, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Does what it says. Only complaint is that it does flake at times.</li>
    <li> This just arrived so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test its waterproof-ness yet. So far so good! It looks wonderfully bold, so I think Falsies is a pretty accurate name! I applied over my Jane Iredale lash primer, as I do with all mascaras. It&#x27;s a tiny bit clumpy but if it&#x27;s truly waterproof, I can live with that. I&#x27;ll update my review with waterproof data after I wear it while swimming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This is very waterproof! I wore it through two showers and it still didn&#x27;t come off! I&#x27;m very confident it will hold up through swimming, too. My lashes look very dramatic, like I like. This is my new favorite waterproof mascara! Much bolder looking than Maybelline Stilettos, which was ok but not dramatic enough.</li>
    <li> I honesty do  it know why this doesn&#x27;t have higher reviews. This is the second time I am buying this mascara from this seller and I plan on buying a lot more. I have very sad straight lashes and this waterproof mascara holds the curl like no other. My holly grail mascara!</li>
    <li> Great mascara I&#x27;ve used it for years</li>
    <li> waterproof horrible or it was old and clumped.</li>
    <li> not what I expected, I like it but it doesn&#x27;t add a lot of volume to my lashes. I have to apply it more then 3x each eye.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this, bought it for my sister, she liked it a lot. Great product.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t order again. Clumpy; doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly: leaves chunks on eye lashes</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really waterproof and does not smudge</li>
    <li> THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU for not going to that horrid plastic brush!!!  I have bought several mascara&#x27;s that have it and I hate them!  For fine lashes those plastic brushes don&#x27;t cover at all, or worse are clumpy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very good on this, it is curved so it is very effective in getting the corners of the eye.  I don&#x27;t know if there is a waterproof version, but that would be nice...  the coverage is very good and not clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  Warm all mascaras a little before applying.  You can do this with warm water or by placing in your arm pit while applying your foundation.  (Your arm pit is very warm and will warm the bottle quickly, and don&#x27;t ewwww me! LOL my pits are clean)  Anyway, this is the best way to apply mascara to get great coverage and even without clumps.</li>
    <li> I have always used Maybelline mascara.  I just randomly picked this mascara to try.  I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t run, it doesn&#x27;t clump.  It will be my new mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I have naturally oily skin and by the end of the day most of it is all around my eyelid&#x27;s instead of my eyelashes, but with this mascara I never have that problem. This mascara is very black which is a plus and if applied correctly you&#x27;ll get amazing length added without any clumps. Also, shipping came about a day or two sooner than it was expected. This now my most favorite mascara and I do plan on buying this product again</li>
    <li> This is my GO-TO mascara now! I LOVE IT and how full my normal lashes look with it!</li>
    <li> Not bad! It&#x27;s mascara and it works decently. I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of these rubber wands.</li>
    <li> This mascara is no different then any other mascara. Nothing special about it. I thought it would give my lashes volume, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this one at all, clumpy and a bit dried out in the tube, maybe it sat on the shelf to long.. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend...</li>
    <li> Ok I like this out of all the mascara this is the best one I like so I am hook on it.</li>
    <li> This came in an unopened package but it seemed to be half empty (or half full, whatever your outlook is). This mascara was always my favorite and go to and lasted me for a long time. When I got this one it started clumping almost immediately and was feeling very dry after a week of use. Tossed it and switched to a different brand. Not sure if a bum one but, I was not happy with it!</li>
    <li> Let me preface this five-star review by saying that I absolutely hated this mascara (I hate all waterproof mascaras in general).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally bought the waterproof Falsies one day. I coated my lashes like I normally do, and went about my day. When I took a shower at the end of the day, I was horrified to find out that all the gentle rubbing, not so gentle rubbing, soap, and water streaming over my lashes was not doing ANYTHING to remove this mascara. Seriously, not even so much as a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason you&#x27;re needing cement grade waterproof mascara, this is the one to get. In terms of how a waterproof mascara is supposed to perform, and how it looks, it earns five stars.</li>
    <li> this product is very good</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It definitely defines my eyelashes, even my lower ones. The only issue I have that is also sated in other reviews is that this mascara is extremely waterproof. This is a really good thing, but it makes it hard to get off. All in all, great product!</li>
    <li> I love the brush on this mascara! It gets every lash and makes them look long &amp; Sexy! Waterproof and smudge resistent</li>
    <li> When they say waterproof they really mean waterproof. I can go swimming, sweat, really anything and this mascara doesn&#x27;t budge and still comes off relatively easy when I use makeup wipes. I also have really short eyelashes and these made them look so much bigger and hold a curl very well. I&#x27;ve tried some bigger name brands with like $30+ mascaras and this one works the best honestly. Now my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
    <li> As a professional I use this day to day on my clients and myself I love this product waterproof is a must for weddings and events</li>
    <li> I have never been disappointed with maybelline products before.  Made my lashes sooo clumpy, it looked like I was applying mascara for the first time.  Absolutely hate it!</li>
    <li> The brush is made so weird you can&#x27;t even scrape off the excess mascara to try to make it less clumpy. Will never purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of brand new mascara. I feel like it coats better after its dried out a TINY bit, or at least there isn&#x27;t so much in the tube. So far this is pretty good.  It does clump a little bit but that is to be expected since it&#x27;s a volume mascara.  I don&#x27;t think it creates a lot of length though.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! It actually stays on and made my lashes look longer</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, great product!</li>
    <li> the mascara was dried out when i recieved it :( was looking forwaed to using it too because of all the good reviews and what not</li>
    <li> Nothing special. I was hoping for fuller lashes and it just seemed like normal mascara.</li>
    <li> Good and waterproof. Doesn&#x27;t melt off me in the summer in the southeast....</li>
    <li> Disappointing. lots of clumps. Does not go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> It is very water-proof. Remind you to buy a good remover. It is really hard to remove. My eye lashes would not stick together any more with this product. But it doesn&#x27;t help my straight eye lashes curl.</li>
    <li> DIS IS A RIP OFFFF, MASCARES ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK JUNKY AND SQUISHY</li>
    <li> My wife bougth it and now she don&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;She bougth 5 of this in this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;she is crazy for this makeup</li>
    <li> So, I bought this mascara after reading a review online, and since I had a bad experience with Maybelline mascara before (namely the Great Lash), I was a little skeptical. But, oh my gosh, this mascara is absolutely amazing. I simply curl my lashes, and then I use an old They&#x27;re Real! Mascara brush to separate my lashes. Then I coat my lashes until I&#x27;m happy, and I end up with thick, dark, full lashes that look quite a lot like false lashes. I recommend this to all my friends!</li>
    <li> its chunky, i dont know if i happened to get a old tube or if it is suppose to be this way.. but i wont buy it again to find out..</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife.  She said she doesn&#x27;t like the waterproof stuff because it&#x27;s kind of cakey, but that&#x27;s probably just waterproof mascara in general.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million different mascaras that all leave clumps or are thin and don&#x27;t leave anything on the lash. After numerous brands, I tried Falsies Flared mascara and have bought nothing else for 2 years. It glides on smooth, no clumps, sticks well to lashes leaving a thick dark, dramatic look. I like the curved brush and the bristles are the perfect firmness for gentle but easy application. It IS highly waterproof and needs eye makeup remover (which I use every other day or so) but that&#x27;s perfect for me. I have no interest in trying any other mascara, this one is perfect and I&#x27;ll stick with it. Definitely recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Always use this brand, makes lashes look longer.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever! Love the brush and the ease of application!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an every-day make-up kind of girl so it takes me a while to go through mascara -- or any make up for that matter. Was running out of the Maybelline Rocket which I didn&#x27;t really like but it was fine. I like this a lot more, doesn&#x27;t clump as much and feels lighter</li>
    <li> clumpy after first week and not the volume I usually get from it.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t clump or flake, which is good for hard contact lens wearers.  Also is tear-proof and doesn&#x27;t smudge easily</li>
    <li> I love it because its a waterproof and  the brush&lt;br /&gt;is a little curve can follow your hair lash I love it&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s kind the product I am looking for long time.</li>
    <li> My relative has been the primary make up artist for several major shows on TV for several years, so whenever I see her I always ask what the best new stuff there is out there. I was shocked when out of all the mascara&#x27;s you could chose from she told me this is the best moderately priced mascara and is the one she uses everyday. Make sure you get the flared one with the wings on the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing, she was right as always. I have not purchased from Amazon yet but will do in the future.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Just be cautious though when taking it off.</li>
    <li> For some odd reason I received mascara that was missing a brush. At first I thought it had just broken so I took the top of the tube off and tried to fish around for the brush. There. was. no. brush. I am seriously baffled as to how this happens. Obviously this is not a seller issue but still an issue none the less. I feel like I sacrificed the brush for the 2 dollars I saved ordering this lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try the mascara with a different brush and it seems to be pretty awesome. It gave my eyelashes a ton of volume. I just wish I could rate on a complete product. This probably would have received 5 stars but unfortunately, the brush is pretty important to me....</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, it&#x27;s great for a formal event because it gives your lashes a beautiful elegant length.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suggest this mascara if you use baby wipes as your main makeup removing item, because it causes the mascara to smudge and almost stick to your lower lids!&lt;br /&gt;YIKESSS&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a neutral looking mascara I would recommend One-by-one Volume express by Maybelline and not this mascara because, this one makes your lashes look powerful and bold.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has helped!</li>
    <li> Made my lashes look great. Really depends on the brush.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. It is just as good as benefits they&#x27;re real mascara. I can&#x27;t believe all the money I&#x27;m saving by switching to this. Curl your lashes and one coat gives full dramatic lashes.</li>
    <li> The mascara is good, makes the eyelashes look full but I wouldn&#x27;t say it looks the same as wearing fake lashes. The only downside is that the mascara is difficult to wash off.</li>
    <li> Mascara lasts really hole day long and it&#x27;s perfect! but I&#x27;,m not lover of flexible brushes. It&#x27;s not easy to apply mascara on all of eyelashes. I tried to use another brush, and it was perfect!</li>
    <li> Very Happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> This mascara works best for me.  I like the curved brush and the way it makes my lashes look.</li>
    <li> This mascara does a great job of lengthening and thickening.  I purchased another &amp;#34;false eyelashes&amp;#34; brand at a vendor/bazarre sale for $30 and I think this works just as well.  Takes 2 to 3 quick coats and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
    <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing! I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine.

    <li> Works fine as expected</li>
    <li> This is an awesome mascara. It plumps, lengthens, and defines to lashes and works miracles to girls like me with less than glamorous lashes</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using this formula for at least 5 years now and have no inclination to look for anything else. Great mascara at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> I use this mascara on top of a L&#x27;oreal volumizing one, and the result is amazing! I find that using this mascara second flares my lashes out and gives them length, where the other gives them the thick volume. They both cost less than one designer tube, and give much better results!</li>
    <li> Mascara goes on easily and does not clump.  Makes lashes look nice and full.</li>
    <li> The product does not disappoint. I was a bit skeptical to try it though because it was a waterproof mascara which I&#x27;m not a big fan of but this has changed all of that! Recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Use with a light touch after you curl your lashes .. let dry well and then re-do the curl to tips .. and you will be amazed ...</li>
    <li> This is a very good brush with a good mascara!  I have short, thin lashes, and Maybelline New York Volum&#x27; Express Falsies Mascara separates my lashes really well while getting a rather good coat of mascara on them.  It does seem to volumize more than it lengthens in my particular case, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with that considering that some mascaras do neither.  It works REALLY well on bottom lashes, too.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice mascara, I use it when I want some thick lashes :D the price is also just right Give it a try</li>
    <li> This is my going out mascara but I have long and thick eyelashes its perfect for people with not a volume but long eyelashes</li>
    <li> Really like the wand shape.  It makes it easy to apply.  The only downside is there&#x27;s a bit of clumping with more than 1 coat.</li>
    <li> I love falsies flared but chose waterproof this time and am not so happy about it. It&#x27;s ok - looks good and gives a lot of volume and length to my eye lashes but I cannot for the life of me get it off! I end up just leaving it on because when I try to get it off it pulls out my lashes. But then leaving it on just causes clumping. Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to waterproof mascara, but Im not a huge fan of this. HOWEVER, I highly recommend the regular falsies flared!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy on amazon but anyway, this mascara is OK. Not the best out there and it does what it is supposed to do. Advice to all-- when using, drain off excess product back into the bottle as much as you can, that way you avoid the excess lumps of mascara on your lashes. Coat as fast as you can so you don&#x27;t have drying before a next coat goes on. Also for REMOVAL which seems to be the biggest issue with this mascara (for me it is easy)! the easiest/ quickest way to remove is to use extra virgin OLIVE OIL  or COCONUT OIL on some cotton balls. Swipe over the eyelashes, careful not to get oil in your eyes, and in no time, mascara goes off. In fact, I use this to clean make up off my entire face before I use my facial cleanser. Nope, it doesn&#x27;t break me out and I have acne prone skin, so try it. I hope fellow consumers find my tips useful...You&#x27;re welcome!!</li>
    <li> I am 67 so I have used a lot of maskara over the years. I needed to make a change because my eyelashes that have always been long and thick, were thinning.  This is a great choice!&lt;br /&gt;- not clumpy&lt;br /&gt;- brush makes go on smoothly and separates&lt;br /&gt;- covers ever last; width and length added&lt;br /&gt;- lasts all day without flaking&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe that after a long day at the office, my eyelashes are still beautiful without having the maskara all below my eye.  I should have started using this long ago.</li>
    <li> I received this item at the end of February, 2013. I used it every couple of days, as I was alternating mascaras at the time. I thought it was decent, but it tended to clump and it dried out after about 3 months. I guess 3 months is when you are suggested to replace your mascara, but I usually wait a little longer. With this mascara I had to get rid of it, since it was useless after it dried out. My favorite part of the mascara, however, was that it stayed put all day when almost every single mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried before, has smudged on my oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mascara since I was a teenager, I&#x27;m now a senior, and NEVERTALES had flaking until I used this mascara.  It&#x27;s awful!  I used Maybelline always.  Why does this flake?  I don&#x27;t know, but I won&#x27;t buy it again. Color me VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the clumping.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite mascaras. I like the wand and this product doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> big, huge, plump luxurious eyelashes. i get so many compliments that i am asked if my eyelashes are real or extensions. this makes an ever bigger impact when i skip eye shadow altogether and just use the mascara. my eyelashes look big and make my eyes pop when i go for the &amp;#34;i don&#x27;t need makeup&amp;#34; look or simply don&#x27;t have time to do a full face. of course using an eyelash curler really helps. don&#x27;t skip that step ever</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely - so far no clumping.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look like falsies, doesn&#x27;t add length at all in my opinion.  It just adds a little coverage and volume.  I don&#x27;t like that there are 2 separate brushes (one for upper lash and one for lower).  I usually just use the upper lash brush for both.  I don&#x27;t think this glides on smoothly either.  I feel like I have to give it a little pressure to really get in between the lashes to prevent clumps.  It&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s worth using til I use it up.  But there&#x27;s nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> out standing job thank you its awsome</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite, HG mascara. I like that it really does make my lashes look like falsies and thickens them up. It&#x27;s also really black, which I love in a mascara. It does flake a little bit, but I don&#x27;t mind sense all mascaras tend to do that. If you&#x27;re looking for a mascara that is pitch black, volumes and lengthens for CHEAP, this is it!</li>
