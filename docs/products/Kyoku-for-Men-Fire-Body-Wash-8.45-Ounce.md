### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good product!</li>
      <li>This soap has very good reviews</li>
      <li>The contents inside the bottle are ideal for a men&#x27;s body wash.  </li>
      <li>Hey it smells great.</li>
      <li>I do not agree with the reviews that give it great reviews.  </li>
      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>If you want something that feels the best and gets you clean then Water.</li>
      <li>It has a nice &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
      <li>They lather up nicely and you can tell the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>It has a nice musky scent to it.</li>
      <li>This is, by far, one of the best body washes I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>would say I liked Fire&#x27;s scent better than that of Wind, but Fire contains microbeads, so I can&#x27;t conscionably order it again.</li>
      <li>Both of the body washes do an excellent job of leaving my skin soft as anything.</li>
      <li>Each one of these are fantastic products that are unique and feel great.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This is the only one that has an exfoliant and probably feels the best.</li>
      <li>What a joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a technique that I use to get more than a drop out, I use 2 hands, but I squeeze with my palms and have it tilted in a way that I can get it in my hands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>has a warm scent to it that lingers ever so lightly after you get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Probably the most herbally scent with some citrus overtones.&lt;br /&gt;Earth-</li>
      <li>But, I really do love the smell</li>
      <li>Great product - nice masculine scent</li>
      <li>If you want something better consider the Baxter products on Amazon, and the others out there.</li>
      <li>This is probably my favorite.</li>
      <li>Every single one of these products is unique, smells great, and feels great.</li>
      <li>You can buy matching body lotion and smell good for almost the whole day when you combo them</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would recommend purchasing this product if you are patient and do not frustrate easily.</li>
      <li>It probably works fine as a body wash.</li>
      <li>But it is true, to get a drop out of this, you have to be Andre the giant or the incredible Hulk.</li>
      <li>This sounded like it might be interesting and worth a try...</li>
      <li>Unique.....</li>
      <li>The container is cool looking but not functional.</li>
      <li>A natural, hot-wood kind of scent that is not overpowering yet noticeable.</li>
      <li>But, on the bright side, you get an extra workout in the shower and the stuff really does smell fantastic.</li>
      <li>The product itself is okay, nice scent, and overall is a decent body wash.</li>
      <li>so hopefully this will be a useful review.</li>
      <li>To me there is definitely a cedar smell or woody smell of some kind that is very enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now, seeing them and hearing many have the same issue with the dreaded bottle, I am cracking up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;No more damaged or dry skin after using this for about three weeks.  </li>
      <li>There is certainly a price premium here, but if you can afford it, you won&#x27;t regret it.  </li>
      <li>so I really do a number on my skin.</li>
      <li>When you step out of the shower you feel a cooling sensation and really clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I ordered it, the product contained polyethylene (plastic) microbeads, much to my dismay.</li>
      <li>I have to say, the product description of each scent is very accurate.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this though until you find out what each version of this really does.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I wanted to find something that would treat my skin better and feature more subtle and mature</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of it to get you clean, which is good because, in both cases, the bottle it&#x27;s contained in is aggressively useless.</li>
      <li>but wish I read other reviews more closely.</li>
      <li>It also has subtle tones of rubber cement in there but somehow still smells good.</li>
      <li>If you are looking to try one of these I highly recommend the fire.&lt;br /&gt;Water-</li>
      <li>I tried these body washes because I said to myself &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not a teenager any more, nor do I live with my parents; it&#x27;s time to use something other than Axe or Old Spice&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I would avoid until they produce a new package design.</li>
      <li>Like most people, I was not able to find them at a store to see if I would like the smell</li>
      <li>First off with the cons that several people have mentioned.</li>
      <li>Makes you feel clean too, getting it out in the other hand...</li>
      <li>definitely ginger present with a unique masculine smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Wind- Lots of Antioxidants and keeps skin young</li>
      <li>Body wash is ok but the bottle sucks.</li>
      <li>Since trying so hard, the bottle actually cracked on me in the corner and now I have to get it out from the crack while the top is shut off.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great, but it is incredibly thick and, because the bottle is square and thicker plastic, I can hardly get the contents out of the bottle without having to take the cap off and slap it into my hand.</li>
      <li>Although I was not sure about the scent of this one at first, I ended up really liking it once I used it.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t think that plastic is what&#x27;s being hinted at when the product page says &amp;#34;Features natural ingredients traditionally used by the Japanese for skin ailments&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A single bottle will last you a decent while.</li>
      <li>reviews have raved about how great it is, and other have said the bottle is hard and it is hard to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I returned, I had a bottle of thick, red shampoo puddled in my bathtub, which took twenty minutes to clean up.</li>
      <li>Plastic microbeads are simply not ecologically friendly, and I feel that we should get ecologically responsible products for the high-end prices that are being charged.</li>

<li> Plastic microbeads are simply not ecologically friendly, and I feel that we should get ecologically responsible products for the high-end prices that are being charged.</li>
<li> I live in a harsh climate and swim five days a week</li>
<li> I transferred it to a new pump dispenser using a small funnel, then it was user-friendly.</li>
<li> but it didn&#x27;t do anything for dry skin)&lt;br</li>
<li> Smell seems to stick around at least as long, if not longer, than more expensive products.  </li>
<li> The main weakness is a poor container design, the soap is thick and the bottle is squared, you&#x27;ll have a pretty hard time getting it out.</li>
<li> Its purpose, I believe, is to actively hinder any attempts to dispense the product.</li>
<li> The packaging while unique is nonetheless very difficult to squeeze.</li>
<li> Yeah, it&#x27;s thick - means you can use less of it, as it lathers up well.  </li>
<li> I can think of no greater torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Although expensive, if you had to get one that you want to use for dates or nights out on the town definitely Fire.</li>
<li> /&gt;Wind&#x27;s scent is quite different and difficult to explain.</li>
<li> For such an expensive product that seems a little ridiculous.</li>
<li> yes, the thickness combined with the square-shaped bottle with the small opening makes it hard to get out.  </li>
<li> agree with the reviews that say it is hard to get out of the bottle.  </li>
<li> It is also obviously very expensive for such a small amount.</li>
<li> The packaging is retarded, but it smells very manly</li>
<li> Annoying enough that the quality of the body wash does not outway the crappiness of the bottle.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s lighter and has vague hints of fruit to it.</li>
<li> so I was disappointed to find it is nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
<li> Good-smelling, though impossible to get out of the container.</li>
<li> But it is literally impossible to use because of the design of the bottle.</li>
<li> However, this is where the bad stuff stops.</li>
<li> That sounds crazy!</li>
<li> but the bottle is tragic.  </li>
<li> I like the body wash, hate the bottle.</li>
<li> A square bottle with rigid sidewalls and a viscous material makes it impossible to dispense without using 50lbs of force!</li>
<li> Like everyone else has said- absolutely horrible bottle design.</li>
<li> Horrible design.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the body wash, hate the bottle. It has a nice musky scent to it.</li>
    <li> Smells.. Unique..... Makes you feel clean too, getting it out in the other hand...</li>
    <li> The contents inside the bottle are ideal for a men&#x27;s body wash.  Getting the contents outside of the bottle is another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed the bottle overlooked critical and basic design elements with regard to convenient liquid flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend purchasing this product if you are patient and do not frustrate easily.</li>
    <li> I tried these body washes because I said to myself &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not a teenager any more, nor do I live with my parents; it&#x27;s time to use something other than Axe or Old Spice&amp;#34;. I wanted to find something that would treat my skin better and feature more subtle and mature scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried both the Wind and Fire body washes at this point. Both of the body washes do an excellent job of leaving my skin soft as anything. A single bottle will last you a decent while. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it to get you clean, which is good because, in both cases, the bottle it&#x27;s contained in is aggressively useless. Its purpose, I believe, is to actively hinder any attempts to dispense the product. The person who designed this bottle should be punished by having to exclusively use the bottle to store any and all liquids. I can think of no greater torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fire has a warm scent to it that lingers ever so lightly after you get out of the shower. When I ordered it, the product contained polyethylene (plastic) microbeads, much to my dismay. Plastic microbeads are simply not ecologically friendly, and I feel that we should get ecologically responsible products for the high-end prices that are being charged. I also don&#x27;t think that plastic is what&#x27;s being hinted at when the product page says &amp;#34;Features natural ingredients traditionally used by the Japanese for skin ailments&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wind&#x27;s scent is quite different and difficult to explain. It&#x27;s lighter and has vague hints of fruit to it. It also has subtle tones of rubber cement in there but somehow still smells good. This product did not contain microbeads, so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I liked Fire&#x27;s scent better than that of Wind, but Fire contains microbeads, so I can&#x27;t conscionably order it again. I wish it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were it not for the microbeads and bottle design, I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Very good product!</li>
    <li> I have now bought and tried the fire, wind, water, and earth body wash by kyoku so hopefully this will be a useful review. First off with the cons that several people have mentioned. The packaging while unique is nonetheless very difficult to squeeze. For such an expensive product that seems a little ridiculous. It is also obviously very expensive for such a small amount. However, this is where the bad stuff stops. Every single one of these products is unique, smells great, and feels great. They lather up nicely and you can tell the quality of the product. Like most people, I was not able to find them at a store to see if I would like the smell so I just bought all of them. I have to say, the product description of each scent is very accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Fire- definitely ginger present with a unique masculine smell. This is probably my favorite. If you are looking to try one of these I highly recommend the fire.&lt;br /&gt;Water- This is the only one that has an exfoliant and probably feels the best. When you step out of the shower you feel a cooling sensation and really clean.&lt;br /&gt;Wind- Although I was not sure about the scent of this one at first, I ended up really liking it once I used it. Probably the most herbally scent with some citrus overtones.&lt;br /&gt;Earth- To me there is definitely a cedar smell or woody smell of some kind that is very enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Each one of these are fantastic products that are unique and feel great. The container is cool looking but not functional. Do what I do, just unscrew the cap when you use it, it&#x27;s really not a big deal. Although expensive, if you had to get one that you want to use for dates or nights out on the town definitely Fire. If you want something that feels the best and gets you clean then Water. For an every day body wash I would go with Wind and then Earth.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps</li>
    <li> The packaging is retarded, but it smells very manly</li>
    <li> Great product - nice masculine scent</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, but it is incredibly thick and, because the bottle is square and thicker plastic, I can hardly get the contents out of the bottle without having to take the cap off and slap it into my hand. In the end, my squeezing the bottle to get the contents resulted in the bottle cracking and, eventually, leaking the contents of the entire bottle into the bathtub while I was away. When I returned, I had a bottle of thick, red shampoo puddled in my bathtub, which took twenty minutes to clean up. It was a total hassle.</li>
    <li> Smells great. A natural, hot-wood kind of scent that is not overpowering yet noticeable. Yeah, it&#x27;s thick - means you can use less of it, as it lathers up well.  Smell seems to stick around at least as long, if not longer, than more expensive products.  You can buy matching body lotion and smell good for almost the whole day when you combo them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, the thickness combined with the square-shaped bottle with the small opening makes it hard to get out.  Take the cap off...</li>
    <li> I live in a harsh climate and swim five days a week so I really do a number on my skin. This is the only product that I have found that takes care of my skin. I use Fire and Water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fire- treats skin that&#x27;s irritated/worn out&lt;br /&gt;Water- treats dry/damaged&lt;br /&gt;Earth- Anti-inflammatory and firms up skin (I used this when I got a bottle as a gift I didn&#x27;t like or dislike this but it didn&#x27;t do anything for dry skin)&lt;br /&gt;Wind- Lots of Antioxidants and keeps skin young (Never tried this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more damaged or dry skin after using this for about three weeks.  I have been using it for about two months now.  I love this stuff.  Don&#x27;t buy this though until you find out what each version of this really does.  Just click on the different version in the Amazon product page and read the description.  The descriptions change each time you click a different version.</li>
    <li> The product itself is okay, nice scent, and overall is a decent body wash. but wish I read other reviews more closely. A square bottle with rigid sidewalls and a viscous material makes it impossible to dispense without using 50lbs of force! How they ever released this package is beyond me. I would avoid until they produce a new package design.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, one of the best body washes I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a nice &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  There is certainly a price premium here, but if you can afford it, you won&#x27;t regret it.  I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> Good-smelling, though impossible to get out of the container. Will add minutes to your shower just to get some soap out.</li>
    <li> Meh. This sounded like it might be interesting and worth a try... so I tried it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews have raved about how great it is, and other have said the bottle is hard and it is hard to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the reviews that say it is hard to get out of the bottle.  I do not agree with the reviews that give it great reviews.  If you want something better consider the Baxter products on Amazon, and the others out there.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else has said- absolutely horrible bottle design. But, on the bright side, you get an extra workout in the shower and the stuff really does smell fantastic.</li>
    <li> I did not read the reviews before I bought this, though I probably would have still bought it. Now, seeing them and hearing many have the same issue with the dreaded bottle, I am cracking up. For a moment I thought that I was losing my strength in my hands. But it is true, to get a drop out of this, you have to be Andre the giant or the incredible Hulk. Since trying so hard, the bottle actually cracked on me in the corner and now I have to get it out from the crack while the top is shut off. What a joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a technique that I use to get more than a drop out, I use 2 hands, but I squeeze with my palms and have it tilted in a way that I can get it in my hands. That sounds crazy! All that work just to get the product out. But, I really do love the smell and so does my woman; she cant get enough, in fact, it arouses her, and that I do not have a problem with.</li>
    <li> This soap has very good reviews so I was disappointed to find it is nothing out of the ordinary. The main weakness is a poor container design, the soap is thick and the bottle is squared, you&#x27;ll have a pretty hard time getting it out. I had to change the contents to a different bottle.</li>
    <li> but the bottle is tragic.  I transferred it to a new pump dispenser using a small funnel, then it was user-friendly.</li>
    <li> Hey it smells great. It probably works fine as a body wash. But it is literally impossible to use because of the design of the bottle. If you must use this product, be prepared to pour it into an actual squeeze bottle and throw away this worse-than-useless packaging.</li>
    <li> Body wash is ok but the bottle sucks. Pain in the ass to get the body wash out. Horrible design. Annoying enough that the quality of the body wash does not outway the crappiness of the bottle. Won&#x27;t buy again without a design change</li>
