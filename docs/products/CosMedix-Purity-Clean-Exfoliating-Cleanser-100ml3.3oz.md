      <li>Eh, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Although it feels a bit minty, and i enjoyed that aspect of it.</li>
      <li>If anything, it has caused my acne to flare up even more.</li>

      <li>Love this face wash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so used to the refreshing feeling and smooth skin</li>
      <li>Been using Cosmedix since 2008 and just love the purity clean exfoliating cleanser.  </li>
      <li>They did help with fine lines and eliminated my breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I sound like an infomercial</li>
      <li>It keeps my face blemish free without over drying.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
      <li>After reading so many positive reviews for this product, I was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>Myface is so clean after use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Purity Clean since the dermatologist I worked for 8 years ago recommended it.</li>
      <li>More specifically, if you have a oily T zone and dry cheeks and occasionally breakouts- this is PERFECT!</li>
      <li>Nothing special in my opinion</li>
      <li>Nothing special tho.</li>
      <li>The all natural products from LUSH are great</li>
      <li>Same quality better deal!</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m being patient about that because there are four months&#x27; worth of scars to heal.</li>
      <li>My skin feels very clean but not dried out.</li>
      <li>The reason I bought this product was someone&#x27;s comment saying this is the right product</li>
      <li>been using this product for a couple years and is by far the best cleanser I have come across in the past decade.</li>
      <li>It also didn&#x27;t give you that clean feeling after use and doesn&#x27;t really foam up even with a cleansing brush or pad.</li>
      <li>Very gentle exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>I thought this particular brand was more natural.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this brand and this product!!</li>
      <li>About four months ago, I had my first outbreak of cystic acne ever- all over my cheeks and chin.</li>
      <li>Use it every morning in the shower, and wash your face with this and a hot wash cloth when you get home in the evening.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to wear much makeup!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how to differentiate from which of their products did what, but will certainly keep going with them all.  </li>
      <li>Pretty decent cleanser.  </li>
      <li>You can use the benefit gentle cleanser and then this product.</li>
      <li>I use this at night and an off brand salycic face wash in the morning and seems to be working very well for me</li>
      <li>but I feel this cleanser really puts the icing on the cake for my skincare routine.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything else that even comes close to providing the same type of clean and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
      <li>I tried several products, watched my diet, slept on clean pillowcases, etc- nothing seemed to work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I bought a few products from this brand and my face has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>I have never loved a another skin product more and believe me when I&#x27;ve tried close to anything!-</li>
      <li>I tried Retin-A, Pro-Active, all natural products, drugstore products, department store products, you name it!  </li>
      <li>Helps keep my skin clear better than any other face wash I&#x27;ve tried (as a former product junkie, this says a lot).</li>
      <li>I have T-zone issue and struggle to keep my face clear.</li>
      <li>I immediately bought this and the Clarity serum (which advertises that its AHAs will fade acne scarring), and have been using them faithfully for nearly a month now.</li>
      <li>I use this cleanser in combination with the LUSH herbalism, ocean salt, vanishing cream, and grease lightning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s baby soft,</li>
      <li>/&gt;2 stars for at least cleaning my face :)</li>
      <li>I would defiantly reconsider using this product if your skin is sensitive.</li>
      <li>I have adult acne prone skin</li>
      <li>These products have been the only method that has worked so consistently for me, and I&#x27;m hoping the serum will fade the scars in the near future.</li>
      <li>Since starting to use it I&#x27;ve developed more painful large blemishes that I rarely had before.</li>
      <li>As a disclaimer I think the product caused a purge of some sorts because I got some new whiteheads the first few days of using it, but they were really small and cleared up quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It literally starts clearing up my skin over night. I know it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it is worth it. I went about a month without using CosMedix products and my face started breaking out again. I started using it this week and my face is already clearing up. GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for the past year, after an aesthetician suggested it for my oily skin. I have T-zone issue and struggle to keep my face clear. I use this cleanser twice a day. I apply without water and then use a wet washcloth to take it off. It keeps my skin clear and doesn&#x27;t dry me out too badly. One bottle should last about 8-10 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliator, however it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup. You can use the benefit gentle cleanser and then this product.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. My skin feels very clean but not dried out.</li>
    <li> I use this at night and an off brand salycic face wash in the morning and seems to be working very well for me</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for 6 years and love it.  I am 53 and get compliments on my skin all the time.  Very gentle exfoliation.  Non drying.  Keeps breakouts at bay.  I don&#x27;t have to wear much makeup!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a while back and I have to say it did nothing to improve my acne. In face I think it just dried my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for at least cleaning my face :)</li>
    <li> This cleanser dried out my skin. the morning after i washed it, my face was broke out and peeling everywhere. I looked liked I had a rash. My skin is sensitive and already dry, but when i use this wash my face gets worse. It also tightens my face, making it feel dirty and hard. I would defiantly reconsider using this product if your skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Purity Clean since the dermatologist I worked for 8 years ago recommended it. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that even comes close to providing the same type of clean and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal on a great product! Same as if I&#x27;d buy it from the day spa! Same quality better deal!</li>
    <li> Love all the products from this line!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help my skin almost whatsoever. Although it feels a bit minty, and i enjoyed that aspect of it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The pores on my face have become smaller and my ccomplexion has definitely improved.  Myface is so clean after use. Will definitely buy again. I use it every night. You only need to use a small amount to cleanse. Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> Eh, it&#x27;s OK. Nothing special in my opinion and it&#x27;s expensive. Will probably never buy again.</li>
    <li> Best face wash for my oily, blackhead-prone skin.  Helps keep my skin clear better than any other face wash I&#x27;ve tried (as a former product junkie, this says a lot).</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser in combination with the LUSH herbalism, ocean salt, vanishing cream, and grease lightning. The all natural products from LUSH are great but I feel this cleanser really puts the icing on the cake for my skincare routine. After only about 5 days of use I&#x27;m noticing my acne scars are fading and the white heads I would always get around my nose area causing inflammation are also clearing up. As a disclaimer I think the product caused a purge of some sorts because I got some new whiteheads the first few days of using it, but they were really small and cleared up quickly.</li>
    <li> Been using Cosmedix since 2008 and just love the purity clean exfoliating cleanser.  It&#x27;s amazing on the skin and helped cleared up my acned within 24 hours.  Amazing product!! Highly recommend this brand and this product!! It never disappoints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 24. I&#x27;m 38 ya&#x27;ll! Every time I buy a different product to try to save money or because I can&#x27;t run out to Walmart and buy CosMedix, I regret the decision. I&#x27;ve gotten so used to the refreshing feeling and smooth skin I get with this product.</li>
    <li> This is great face wash. I use it in combination with the clarity serum, and they have significantly reduced my hormornal acne</li>
    <li> I bought a few products from this brand and my face has never looked better.  They did help with fine lines and eliminated my breakouts.  Don&#x27;t know how to differentiate from which of their products did what, but will certainly keep going with them all.  I use this product, the serum and the hydrating spray.  (the spray I have used for a year now and is what inspired me to give the other products a try)</li>
    <li> Too chemically for me.  I thought this particular brand was more natural.  This cleanser looks like the old Prell shampoo to me and doesn&#x27;t smell good.  Unfortunately, I just had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle of this stuff and I will never use another product again. It keeps my face blemish free without over drying. I have normal to combination skin and have found that it is the best thing for me.</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews for this product, I was excited to try it. Unfortunately after using it faithfully for several weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin. If anything, it has caused my acne to flare up even more.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates and deep cleans, tightens skin pores for a healthier skin. Highly recommend this product. Lasts at least 3 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time.  Decided to buy it off amazon because my local store was closed and it was a bit cheaper.  Not sure I&#x27;ll do this again.  The formula feels and smells different.  It almost leaves a soapy film on my face.  When I looked on the back of the packaging, it says it was made in Canada, while all the previous bottle was manufactured in the US.  Not sure if that&#x27;s the difference or not, but I probably will not be ordering it online anymore.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne prone skin and this did not improve the problem. Since starting to use it I&#x27;ve developed more painful large blemishes that I rarely had before. It also didn&#x27;t give you that clean feeling after use and doesn&#x27;t really foam up even with a cleansing brush or pad. I gave it three weeks hoping it would improve things and still hated it.</li>
    <li> About four months ago, I had my first outbreak of cystic acne ever- all over my cheeks and chin. I tried several products, watched my diet, slept on clean pillowcases, etc- nothing seemed to work. The woman who runs a salon I visited gave me a sample of this about a month before my breakout occurred. After trying all the methods I knew, I found the sample and in just one use, I saw an improvement in softness and redness. I immediately bought this and the Clarity serum (which advertises that its AHAs will fade acne scarring), and have been using them faithfully for nearly a month now. I have seen such an improvement in the acne- no new breakouts besides an occasional blemish that will go away in a couple days of using both products. These products have been the only method that has worked so consistently for me, and I&#x27;m hoping the serum will fade the scars in the near future. I&#x27;m being patient about that because there are four months&#x27; worth of scars to heal. I hope that anyone else who struggles from cystic acne will give this product a try- it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this product was someone&#x27;s comment saying this is the right product is you have combination skin. More specifically, if you have a oily T zone and dry cheeks and occasionally breakouts- this is PERFECT! I have never loved a another skin product more and believe me when I&#x27;ve tried close to anything!-</li>
    <li> Pretty decent cleanser.  Nothing special tho.</li>
    <li> I am 27 and have had acne on my cheeks, forehead, chin, nose area, etc. for as long as I can remember.  I tried Retin-A, Pro-Active, all natural products, drugstore products, department store products, you name it!  Nothing ever seemed to help my oily skin, clogged pores, and never-ending breakouts.  10+ years of picking at my skin has left me with bad scarring as well.  I am so so so thankful my coworker told me about this face wash!  I have been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin looks AMAZING!  It&#x27;s baby soft, my breakouts are gone, my pores are invisible, and I can tell it is starting to slowly take care of my scarring.  I have never had results like this with anything I&#x27;ve tried, EVER.  If you&#x27;re wondering about whether to buy this, BUY IT.  Use it every morning in the shower, and wash your face with this and a hot wash cloth when you get home in the evening.  Leave it on a bit longer for a more exfoliating mask.  It works wonders!  I sound like an infomercial but honestly, you won&#x27;t be sorry you tried this!</li>
    <li> been using this product for a couple years and is by far the best cleanser I have come across in the past decade.</li>
