    <li> Always works as promised...What else can you ask of Shampoo?</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean using this shampoo. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> Paul Michelle has great products and with the price being so modest on Amazon how can you pass up such an opportunity.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair product! I use it along with the daily moisturizer. Amazing results with &#x27;pool hair&#x27; (hair gets very stiff and brittle when exposed to chlorine).</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this product for several years and are satisfied with it&#x27;s performance.  The shampoo is very good and the size is right for us.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo.  His hair and scalp can get dry, so this helps with moisture and gives his hair nice body without weighing it down.  If you need something for actual dry itchy scalp, then maybe a Tea Tree type of shampoo is best for that (my husband uses that as well once in a while).&lt;br /&gt;Paul Mitchell products are good basic hair care products that deliver what they say and aren&#x27;t crazy expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I still use many of their products as well.

    <li> Always buy Paul Mitchell shampoo.  I do not buy the off-market brands of this shampoo because it just is not the same. Leaves your hair clean, shiny and has a conditioner in it.  Love using it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Paul Mitchell products for years.  I know it&#x27;s not healthy to wash your hair everyday but sometimes it&#x27;s necessary to make it look right.  This shampoo does not dry out my hair when I use it daily.  My hair shines and is manageable.  I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos but always come back to this shampoo as my regular.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seemed like it had been watered down or something. This is my first time buying the moisture shampoo by Paul Mitchell so I&#x27;m not sure what the consistency of the shampoo is supposed to be. I was thinking it would be a bit thicker and not so runny.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought other Paul Mitchell products in the past but, they were from an actual like retail store (that you can walk into).</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo.  It makes my hair clean and soft.  I use it every day.  I would recommend this shampoo to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had hoped this would work without conditioner but for both my wife and I, without conditioner, it left our hair frizzy. With conditioner it seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> Thought Paul Mitchell products were suppose to be good...even though this is made to moisturize, it seem to dry my hair out. I used it for two weeks, washing my hair every-other-day. My hair is fine and fragile. This made my hair more brittle.</li>
