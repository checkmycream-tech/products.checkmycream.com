<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Why pay big buc&#x27;s to have a nail salon do this when you can do yourself.  JUST GET THEM FOR WHAT YOU PAY FOR THEM  THE NAIL SALON CHARGES YOU THE SAME</li>
    <li> Nice for granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;d read that some people were unhappy with the size, but these were just what I expected.  If you have a question about size, look at the pictures that show the fingernail and you&#x27;ll get an idea of the size of the individual rhinestones in context.  Mine arrived in great condition with only a tiny bit of spillover between colors.</li>
    <li> I love this product. the dispenser is easy to spin. fits well in your hands. the opening is big enough for me to fit my dotting tool in there to pick up rhinestone. looks amazing on my nails. love these rhinestones...</li>
    <li> get it in a very timely matter. and love all the color. will buy it again or even in a different size.</li>
    <li> What I saw on the website and what I got in the mail was exactly the same ! And they arrived a day early which was very cool ! I ordered two different sets of rhinestones and these colorful ones are so pretty, and the packaging they arrived in was very neat and clean. Good job !</li>
    <li> Shipped fast (all things considered) and has great colors.  I know there is not 100 of each color like there should be but for under $2, I don&#x27;t really care!  For that price I&#x27;ll just order some more.  All the little jewels are in the right spaces to boot!  No sorting!</li>
    <li> I expected these to be just a slight bit larger than what I received. The product itself is fine, it works, gets the job done. Pretty colors. I think they are pretty when you complete a design with them you get a better affect.</li>
    <li> Loved Loved Loved this product</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy your little nail crystals in the beauty stores. You get a tiny fraction for the price and amount you get with these. I&#x27;m not joking. Buy this, see its bursting with adorable little crystals in a myriad of colors and then go to a beauty supply store. The same exact little container is for sale, for the same exact price, except theirs is so empty its almost a joke. It seriously looks like a white circle with some colorful ants alone inside. I think it&#x27;s going to take me 5 years to get through all these crystals and I do my own manicure 2x a week. To be fair, crystals aren&#x27;t always a part of it but they are such an easy way to glam up a manicure they are included pretty frequently. Do yourself, and your nails a favor and buy this pack. You&#x27;ll never waste your money on packaging in the stores again.</li>
    <li> Las pelitas estan peque&amp;ntilde;as son de buen tama&amp;ntilde;o no se ven rusticas en la mano, me gusto mucho la rapidez porque estaba supuesta a recibirlas, hasta mediados de junio y vinieron rapidisimo.</li>
    <li> Theyre really cute and I think theyll be fun to decorate my nails with. But when I opened the package about half of them had already fell out of wheel since when its on the closed triangle gems can still get out through a crack. Besides that theyre pretty cute and if you dont mind picking up a few I would definintley reccomend them.</li>
    <li> very cute and exactly what i was expecting. They are smaller than it looks but its great anyways!! DEALS!! DEALS!! DEALS!!</li>
    <li> These are fun when you are playing with nail art.  Just place them with tweezers on wet nails, then cover them with clear top coat.  Takes patience, but the results are nice.</li>
    <li> I ordered a multi color pack and got an all clear pack, they are teeny tiny stones but I will use them anyways and order a new set of colors.</li>
    <li> I chose to start doing my nail designs on my own and buying these rhinestones was a great idea!! I apply a coat a clear polish then the stones and another coat of clear polish to lock them in place! They look amazing! Great buy!</li>
    <li> So cute and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  I&#x27;d buy more but I still haven&#x27;t ran out, you get so many!</li>
    <li> I bought this item because of good customer rating, but I am thoroughly disappointed. The rhinestones look like cheap plastic pieces that don&#x27;t even sparkle much. The shape is so uneven (not a half-sphere like it should be) and the bottom of each stone is so bumpy they don&#x27;t sit flat on the nail surface well at all. Most sit half floating and the edge catches on things very easily. 7 out of 10 fell off next day (usually maybe 1 or 2 fell off the next day at most). I do not recommend buying this at all. You get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> i ordered this, and instead, i got a similar pack with 2 diff colors- instead of black and light blue, i got hot pink and light purple. i would have preferred the other product, but i dont want to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but they sent  me the wrong product. I ordered these because it seemed like a colorful set from the description but when I opened the package it was the silver moon rhinestone set in different designs but all the same color. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Super cute and inexpensive. I only wish the gems wouldn&#x27;t leave the silver residue on the nail when they fall off. It is difficult to remove and is a bit damaging to the nail. These gems are a cute way to keep nail biters under control. Who would want to ruin a perfect design, or even swallow a tiny gem right?</li>
    <li> I bought these so I could make my nails all pretty but in my opinion they are too bulky for nail gemstones. They would be great to use for something else though.</li>
    <li> AWSOME. Great price. Good quality. Good size.  Only thing took couple weeks to get but worth the wait. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I just got these last night (12/30/13) and I did the math, they were about 4 months late ( i ordered them on 8/3/13) I was really surprised because I didn&#x27;t think these would ever arrive at all. They were sorted, but when you opened it they would mix and they are very tiny on my finger nails the colors in the picture do not look like the colors you get. They are very cheap, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Awesome they are nail jewels... I love em</li>
    <li> You dont get as much as you think from this, but its okay for what I need it for.  I mean, it was only  $1.30, but I expexted a bit more pieces. Also, they were packed great, no mixed up rhinestones or anything.</li>
    <li> Such flimsy packaging that the beads fall out.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors and they are so shiny even the black colored ones I mostly liked the light green ones they were above my expectations and also because I love green... thanks</li>
    <li> I ordered these and they came pretty quickly for nail stuff from overseas, but the colors in the picture are way off. I thought I was going to be getting  yellow rhinestones, which is one of the reasons I ordered them, but sadly I did not. They are green, which is fine, but not exactly what I wanted. They are great otherwise.</li>
    <li> just what i wanted. i just wish they would have come with a small wooden stick (or anything) to help put them on with.</li>
    <li> these rhinestones are amazing, they go with my nails perefectly, not too big or small. I would reccomend this product to people who want rhinestones</li>
    <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the wheel disc was insufficient and caused mixing of the gems, but then I saw the actual colors in them, and see that three of the compartments are a \\&quot;mixed bag\\&quot; of colors- which means I have to separate them out- not a lot of fun when they&#x27;re 2mm gems and dial wheel container- there are also rectangular pieces in one of the compartments, and that&#x27;s not what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad deal when you want a grab bag surprise, but when you want specific, you can do better.</li>
    <li> This probably would have been a good product if it had not arrived with the rhinestones all over the place. The container had come apart and they spilled all out and now the colors are all mixed up. :(</li>
    <li> The rhinestones weren&#x27;t separated well enough. Good product though.</li>
    <li> Great my wife loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the variety of gemstones that I received in this pack. The colors are vibrant, and they are a excellent way to jazz up my nails when I am in the mood for a little bit of sparkle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gems are easy to apply, I have found that it is easiest to first apply a small amount of topcoat to the fingernail, then simply dip a toothpick in a dab of clearcoat and use the tip of the toothpick to gently tap the top of the gemstone. The top of the stone will stick to the toothpick and allow you to place it wherever you like on the nail. Once all gems are placed in the desired design, finish with a high quality topcoat like Seche Vite and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> Good set with a good amount of stones.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for this to arrive. Once it did, I took off my design and did another one just to try this rhinestones. I really recommend them. Best of all, the price is amazing. You can&#x27;t beat a deal like that.</li>
    <li> Awesome if you want to add a little extra to your nails. Love the variety of colors. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> THe compartments are not very full. But still a value for the price. Really no complaints. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Stones are very poor quality ....cloudy, dull and no shine like they should have. I wouldnt waste my money on these again.</li>
    <li> i love these crystals! i use them all the time. i love the&lt;br /&gt;variety of colors that they have. You cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> Cute colors , cute wheel. I thought the pieces were going to better than they actually were but they still worked the same and did the same job.</li>
    <li> These are pretty and I did not pay very much for them.  I should have bought more for  my girls.</li>
    <li> Product came faster than I expected and the stones are perfect size/color. They&#x27;re not full of static like others I&#x27;ve bought before (plastic rubbing against plastic does that :( ), which helps make it easier to work with. They&#x27;re a nice edition to any nail art starter or pro&#x27;s collection.</li>
    <li> its great to have something to make flower and different design on my nails such as lines and to add bling to my nails</li>
    <li> got these for my goddaughter, she is really into nail design so I bought her a bunch of items from this seller because the prices were so great. Going to put it all together and give her a nail design kit for Christmas. I think she will be thrilled.</li>
    <li> The product came in the amount of time it was expected to get here. It took me a while to figure out how to open it. Haha. You have to slide the plastic top around to the different gems. It was a little tricky. Overall very pleased :)</li>
    <li> awesome product&lt;br /&gt;bigger than expected but they still worked&lt;br /&gt;bright colors&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t seem like much but worth the money being paid</li>
    <li> Certainly the right price.  Used them to decorate my granddaughters nails.  Cute but hard to stay on.  I&#x27;m sure they have a multitude of other craft uses.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors they give you, plus the size of the gems. I will deff be buying again.</li>
    <li> my wife uses it all the time with my nieces and her neice as well as herself and randomly while im sleeping grr lol</li>
    <li> This set came with a nice array of colors. The stones are very nice and show great when they hit the light. It came in a nice pin wheel. Not only did I find this great for nails but the stones are also great for personalizing things with. All of the colors that came in this wheel was lovely. They are easy to use and set on to nails. I was very happy with how long the lasted after being applied to the nails. They are the perfect size for nail art.</li>
    <li> Could have been more descriptive about the fact that it is very small and only give you about 15 per section.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my grown daughter and she loves it for herself and her daughter. They have fun with it.</li>
    <li> received thanks. was not happy that they wasn&#x27;t separated into colours every single one is mixed and took quite a while to sort it all out</li>
    <li> These gemstones have gotten me so into doing my nails now. I love all the creative styles I can do now. The colors are awesome and the small sizes are great for nails. Bright colors and so many stones to last for a while. Luv Em!!!</li>
    <li> Good price but I expected it to be bigger then it was still good I would buy again and I have been using them and applying them with crazy glue and it actually stays on with out losing color brightness and comes right off with out damaging my nail</li>
    <li> I ordered and received this item in record time - just a few days. I thought it would take forever. Unfortunately the other items I ordered from other sellers is taking longer so I haven&#x27;t been able to use them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I am not going to count the rhinestones but there is plenty here despite the containers not looking as full as the picture. I will grow bored of them long before I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are cute and sparkle. For the price, I am happy!</li>
    <li> They are very small, but if you have the right tools they&#x27;re not too difficult to handle. You get a lot of beautiful pieces for a small price</li>
    <li> These are pretty, and there are a lot of different colors. But they are not 2mm stones and so they are of no use to me for my project. They are much smaller.</li>
    <li> 1200 rhinestone for this price and the quality of them are wonderful.  I am going to buy different color wheel</li>
    <li> Very cheap...will never use</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. They are a good good size and they come in a plethora of colors. My favorite being clear.</li>
    <li> i love this thing and i love that they have too many color. also they come fast i only have to wait 2weeks</li>
    <li> I like the amount that you can get with the order,  especially for the price.  Nice colors too. Good job.</li>
    <li> size is extremely small and hard to work with.  but it was so cheap, I would consider it value for what was paid.</li>
    <li> this works with the pen great.  This is to use on my granddaughters.  They like bling and so do I.</li>
    <li> So adorable, very well detailed. Easy to use and remove, no need to go to an expensive salon when you can do it yourself with these.  There are so many it&#x27;s really a great deal!</li>
    <li> just wish the dial was a little bigger; a little hard to turn it and get into the right section, but great for what i needed.</li>
    <li> Good variety of colors and a good amount of rhinestones in each compartment.  Since I&#x27;m not a nail expert, I was not aware I need to have a wax rhinestone picker pencil to pick these up.  I used a pair of needle nose tweezers and for every one I got on my nail, I lost 5 or 6.</li>
    <li> Got them faster then I thought. Like the small size wheel. Will order again. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have had these before but again when I go to get my nails done they charge a lot why not buy my own</li>
    <li> i didnt think that they were that small and not enough to do multiples phones. i will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> i really love the colors i the container its easy to open and select the stones i will buy more</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these only received 1. I sent an E-mail they did send the either one. It took a kong time to get. Next time I will order from e-bay this type if product there they care if they get 3 stars or 5.  I think this product is ok nothing awesome but, like I said I would order these inexpensive type items from E-bay just to ensure you get them. Good luck</li>
    <li> Theyre a great product but the product itself is nowhere near as full as the picture looks. its barely even half full. but the gems that are in it dont look cheap and stick really well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get 1200 jewels like it says.. instead, I got nearly 200. that&#x27;s a whole thousand left! I would&#x27;ve ordered from someone else even if it wasn&#x27;t as cheap. now we know why it was so darn cheap! THEY RIP YOU OFF!</li>
    <li> These are nice and shiny and the stick very well on nails!!! I like that the colors are separate also!</li>
    <li> I love the colors. They&#x27;re so pretty and can match like any nail art design. I didn&#x27;t get all the same colors in the picture, but i was satisfied. One thing i noticed was that my dark pink and my black rhinestones were a tiny bit smaller than the others. I really don&#x27;t know why, and i can&#x27;t say i like it very much. Other than that, they&#x27;re great, and with about two coats of top coat you&#x27;ll be good for probably 4-6 days.</li>
    <li> love the variety in colors! there is a color for every occasion! can&#x27;t beat the price. Takes a while to get them, but I&#x27;m not complaning.</li>
    <li> nice lil colorful diamonds. would give a 5 star but not what i expected. still they&#x27;re nice, would be better if it included some type of glue for them.</li>
    <li> I love this case! It is larger than the other cases and I was able to put all the gems I have ordered in one case. Otherwise gems were great, I think I have enough gems between my 3 different orders to last me the next 15 years. LOL</li>
    <li> They took a while to get them about 3 weeks shorter then expected time. I&#x27;ve used them on my toes about a month ago &amp; they are still on my toes. I change my manicure twice weekly on average but when I use the rhinestones on my nails they stayed on most of the time had problems with the black ones staying on. And if I did a lot of cleaning/ moving furniture a few came off. But for the price well worth it!</li>
    <li> worst thing i ever had for nails it just slides right off of your nails u shouldnt by this worst</li>
    <li> My darther love it now i see her making new stily for it she ask me for more so she is</li>
    <li> lover the price to this...ive used most if it up after a couple time if you going to buy this buy a coupld at a time</li>
    <li> They are amazing I can do any design I want with these very easy to use very easy to remove the possibility with these are endless I even use them for blinging other stuff as well as my nails</li>
    <li> Love these rhinestones!! Great price, great product.  They stay in place with just top coat.  No krazy glue needed.  Just placed my second order for three more wheels.</li>
    <li> great color assortment.&lt;br /&gt;nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;this will work out fine for the gift basket of nail items we are making for our aspiring nail tech!</li>
    <li> great item so glad that I ordered it... exactly what it stated it was and no issues of any note</li>
    <li> takes a while to arrive but It&#x27;s worth it! plus super cheap, there are lots of colors. I would buy again</li>
    <li> The lid was very difficult to remove.  It cracked when I pried it off.  Now it is unusable so we had to find another way to keep the colors apart.  (They mixed together getting the lid off.)  The gems worked very well.  They stayed on for about 5 days on our first try.  They got caught on things.  When they came off, they took the nail polish with them.  My daughter likes them though and is happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Do not pass up this deal.  All the colors look great together. Use them for nails and crafts.  Buy 2 or more</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the picture makes the product look much bigger than what it is. The stones were mixed up instead of being in their own separate compartment.</li>
    <li> There are plenty of crystals for any project you have. The size is great for nails or small craft projects.</li>
    <li> Love these,I use these a lot when I&#x27;m making the 5 dotted flower. I decided to buy my sissy these so that she could use them too,she loves them.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my three daughters (tweens/teenager) and they love using these to add sparkle to their nails for fun!</li>
    <li> colors are very deceiving... these are not the colors I got but still cute... there needs to be a better pic</li>
    <li> Very nice! The colors are pretty. If your just starting out doing your nails, these will be great for you, especially if you&#x27;ve priced the stuff at the beauty supply stores!!</li>
    <li> Just live these nail art rhinestones for your nails but they do pop off easy that&#x27;s why I bought 5 of them bc u go through them quickly..</li>
    <li> Took 18 days to get (not bad), very pretty assortment, good price.&lt;br /&gt;However they aren&#x27;t a lot of stones, maybe 50-70 per container.&lt;br /&gt;Still a very good product for the price. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the different color assortments. Will be great to use for any creative design on the nail or even the toes. The wheel design helps keep the Rhinestones separate.</li>
    <li> It is what i expected.. a bit of waiting for delivery, but you cant beat the price. woth the money</li>
    <li> i have used them already. used my dotter to add to some flower designs . they were great add ons that brought out the simmer . easy to use.</li>
    <li> this is a great little wheel, fits in the palm of my hands, I have medium sized hands. great combination of colors. Easy to use and with the way the wheel works shouldn&#x27;t spill too easily.</li>
    <li> Descent Product. I&#x27;m Used To Using Crystals Not rhinestones. Once I TOp CoAt Them The stone seems To Be Really Cloudy. Do Not Like That Look At All. For The Price, Descent.</li>
    <li> My grandaughter loves these gems and the price was very reasonable and she can change her nail art in a flash.</li>
    <li> I loved the color rhinestones. I use this a lot for my nail design and the size is perfect, not too big nor small. The wheel is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t let the stones mix with the others. The opening is perfect to use with any type of tweezers. This item shipped fast and I would definitely recommend for those that like to give a nice finish to their nail art.</li>
    <li> The stones are pretty and nice small size for nail art but the wheel seems to contain less than 1200 as described by seller. I contacted the seller about it and was told to take pics, COUNT the stones and get back to them. Crazy!!!</li>
    <li> These are some teeny tiny rhinestones. But they are cute and worth the price. I like them a lot. Invest in nail art tweezers. it helps.</li>
    <li> What a gyp! There were not 1200 crystals.  There might be 20 crystals in each of the 12 slots. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I thought I was gonna get more rhinestones, but it does the job.... Ohhhh some of them are different sizes.... Watch out</li>
    <li> There are so many fabulous rhinestones in this container! They are smaller than some other rhinestones I have so I can do pave looks with these combined with larger stones. Terrific buy for the price!</li>
    <li> They give you lots of great colors. You will can use them for all kinds of nail art designs. Good price also</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for and I hardly use this. I wish they were brighter colors. Some of the colors are hard to see once placed on your nails</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised, exactly what I ordered.now I can practice doing my own nails.  I don&#x27;t have anything else to say</li>
    <li> There may not as many as promised, but its still a pretty good buy. I seriously paid $0.08 for these. Do you HONESTLY think I care if some are missing? Nope, not one care given. As long as you seal them in well with a good topcoat, you&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> It was very true to order.&lt;br /&gt;I like them alot.&lt;br /&gt;They look like they will&lt;br /&gt;stay on w/nail glu or top&lt;br /&gt;coat. Need to order from&lt;br /&gt;them...Nail glu.  I like their&lt;br /&gt;products. Colors are very&lt;br /&gt;pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> The colors are really nice, they are smaller then I thought they were tho. I havent had a chance to use them but they will add a nice little touch to your nails</li>
    <li> I love it. All is as shown on picture. Im going to have fun with my nails now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for it&#x27;s price. Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t have 1200 crystals, but I didn&#x27;t count like other customers. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the quality and quantity this little box provided.</li>
    <li> I never got it. Do not trust. I kept waiting and waiting but I still have not recorded it :(</li>
    <li> These are perfect! They are the perfect size and the colors are great! They even stayed on great just by applying a bit of topcoat underneath. My guess is that there is not 1200 but there is definitely enough that you could ever need.</li>
    <li> To be honest, this product really only gets two stars because I received part of it, and the shipping was much faster than expected (~2 weeks instead of 4). I ended up getting a little bit more than half the gems that was advertised in the posting (711, instead of 1200). Secondly, the photo is quite misleading; the wheel of gems is MUCH smaller (about 2.5 inches across) than the picture makes it out to be, and you don&#x27;t get many of the same colors. The wheel I received has the following colors: light blue, black, light pink, clear, light green, light purple, magenta, dark blue, dark green, dark purple, dark red, and amber yellow. Some colors have more quantity than others, with the lowest number of any I received being 39, and the highest 87. I&#x27;d originally bought this to give as a gift -- Not doing that, I&#x27;d be embarrassed for someone to open this!! Hopefully I can get my money back...</li>
    <li> very cheap and my friend likes it. so I can not complaint about it..</li>
    <li> It had many cute colors to play around with. when the light hits them they truly look amazing! I really like this product!</li>
    <li> Just as described and packed quite nicely for a international item!  Item was priced just right and while the quality is good, the items are so small you wouldn&#x27;t know without a magnifying glass if there were any flaws.  Circular storage is perfect for the item and made it easy to get just the right crystal.</li>
    <li> Love these little nail gems! Very pretty. Love all the colors! I have so many options now for my nail designs.</li>
    <li> This is as I expected. Really good!!</li>
    <li> I am not someone who is going to count these, so I have no idea if there are 1200 crystals.  Each compartment is totally full, and with 12 colors, I know it&#x27;s very close to what is stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought angled tweezers to apply these with.  Also, I use gel polish to put these on with.  A gel coat will not solidify unless cured under a UV lamp.  After applying a thin coat, the stones can be moved around until it&#x27;s cured.  This makes is much easier than using glue or regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are a good variety as well!</li>
    <li> i was really impressed with the amount of rhinestones i got and the colors on the picture here, don&#x27;t do it justice! they are so much brighter and gorgeous! love it and totally worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> all is good, just the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; rain stone like on the picture (why i ordered it) isnt in it :-( other color instate</li>
    <li> The container is Really small, but the rhinestones are PERFECT sized for doing nails and there seems to be a lot in there. i&#x27;m not about to count them. Good product for great price!</li>
    <li> Ok rhinestones if your just starting out with nail art. Are great for practicing.  They do dull when you apply a top coat.</li>
    <li> these save me tons of money . they are so expensive and I use them for nail art at work I can do much more for my clients and not charge an outragous price.</li>
    <li> The item listing says there are 1200 jewels, the only way that is possible it if there are 100 of each color, as there are 12 colors. there clearly are not 100 of each color. there are MAYBE 50 of each. the only reason i gave this 3 stars is it came earlier than expected, and i have not yet had the chance to use them so i cannot comment on quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and so easy to apply.  My girls and I have had so much fun creating new designs on our nails.</li>
    <li> FUN.Great quality,hell of a deal.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love doing my nails and ordering this was a great idea.Not only is it exactly wat i ordered it only came after 3 days of ordering it!!!!!!!!!! I would recommended this to any nail design lovers.</li>
    <li> I liked these, they were a good size for nails.  easy to apply to your nails, I would deff. order these again</li>
    <li> I expected them to be that color. and a little but higher then what they are. they are nice but I wanted those colors.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty!  They are great quality and a wonderful price!  I would recommend these if you are looking for a good product for a very inexpensive price!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good quality.  Nice colors. Very shiny and sparkly. Fairly easy to use. Perfect for what I wanted it for.</li>
    <li> liked the product, but it did take several weeks to arrive.  it was stated that it would take awhile, so i was not shocked.  but still, 3+ weeks is a bit crazy!</li>
    <li> I like the colors and the sizes are perfect. They took a while to get to CA but its great for the price.</li>
    <li> The nail gems are what they say they are but when you turn the top the different colors can mix super easy I didn&#x27;t care for the packaging to much.</li>
    <li> Lovely product can&#x27;t wait to get it again</li>
    <li> The colors in the picture are so pretty. They are not like that in person. They are very basic colors.</li>
    <li> These are a great addition to anyone&#x27;s nail designs. They are easy to apple with a curved tweezers and stays put when applying a top coat on or my preference (sealing them with gel polish)</li>
    <li> I love the gems...the container was a lot smaller than I expected but I still love them...love all the colors...</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife since she loves doing her nails. The product got here sooner than the estimated date. She was surprised that she didn&#x27;t get that many rhinestones. She thought it would be filled up with it or at least have a decent amount but it&#x27;s not. There&#x27;s probably 30 something in it. Some of the colors aren&#x27;t like the ones in the picture. But overall, she think this is a pretty good product. She likes making cute designs. But I just might order a different set of rhinestones for her when she runs out of these.</li>
    <li> I actually took the time to count each color, and then averaged them. 72 per color, a little over 300 short. a while quarter of the total is not there. I did not expect an exact 1200, but that is a very significant difference in what I was promised to what I received. So I can not get a better score for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had a chance to use them yet, hopefully tonight if my niece cooperates.&lt;br /&gt;**** I have now had a chance to use them. Sticking them onto tacky nails, they did not stick that well, my niece had peeled them off the next day. And my top coat did not help, but that may be because I need a new one. I would recommend Nail Glue to get them to stick. Then they will stay where you put them and a little hard to knock off, or pick off too easily.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, for the price, this was a pretty good deal, just wish I had gotten the full amount and I would be extremely happy!!</li>
    <li> They are serving their purpose well. No surprises and hold up well enough to body glue to be used as body jewel &amp;#34;tattoos&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell from the picture, but in the wheel I received, there are no clear gems, which is definitely a bummer. The only color that is remotely light enough is the light pink. Other than that, the colors are nice and the price was very low.</li>
    <li> Too small. Thought the product was going to be bigger</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price!,, :))</li>
    <li> I like it n used them on my nails all the time.</li>
    <li> Nice bright colors.  Easy to use.  I placed on a top coat that was still sticky but not wet or they slide.  I let top coat finish drying and added another coat over the nail and stones.  colors didn&#x27;t get wonky, sometimes they turn with a milky tint to them, these didn&#x27;t.  They stayed on till I removed them 2 weeks later.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Nice tiny wee little stones. Good sturdy container. Very Cheap, but very worth it.</li>
    <li> A bit large for my fingernails which are kept very short but perfect for my toes. They&#x27;re about 2 mm in diameter</li>
    <li> Great selection of jewels for home nail art!</li>
    <li> Love doing my nails with these</li>
    <li> This product is so misleading! It&#x27;s suppose to be 1200 in the pack but each color barely has 50 stones. They are so tiny so I probably doubt they will even look right on my nail. Will not be buying from this seller ever again.</li>
    <li> I mostly bought this pack for the black rhinestones, and luckily they were in there :) They are small, I didn&#x27;t realize that 2mm is smaller then the stones I already have, but I&#x27;m not mad. It was a nice surprise. They are still super cute! Also, all rhinestones you buy are going to be &amp;#34;static-y&amp;#34; and a few might stick to the top of the wheel as you turn it. Just don&#x27;t turn very fast and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> It is not true to size, this is a very small compact container, it appears larger on than it actually is</li>
    <li> Not exactly pack of 1200 more like 467 didnt have enough to fill two of my nails (short ) of the same color used about 17 per nail :( ....</li>
    <li> i love the colors but wish it would have came with more rhinestones, instead it only came with a small amount of each color.</li>
    <li> Product was recevied in a timely manner.  Howver, the crystals arrived spilled from the slots within the container it self.  I suppose I willl have to be patient in trying to sort my way through.  Recommend placing a plastic film coating over the slotted display case to ensure the crystals stay intact.</li>
    <li> It took a while to come but everything was there and there was no damage when it came it. Happy with it!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this set at all. This container is so small until you can hardly get the stones from out of it.</li>
    <li> Received the little gems today, they&#x27;re beautiful and shiny. The thing that&#x27;s bothering me though, none of the gems are in the container shown, they are all in the little bag it&#x27;s sealed in. I&#x27;ll be spending my weekend separating these buggers. I suggest a better container to who ever put these together. Other wise, pretty excited to use them!!</li>
    <li> you get a lot for your money, the quality is not the best but great for the money. they are NOT crystal so once the top coat is applied, the shine is mainly gone</li>
    <li> I chose to give the product two stars because I was expecting 1200 crystals - maybe half or less was actually supplied. There is an array of colors which I liked so I could change it up every now and then. Overall just disappointed in the false amount.</li>
    <li> First Time Purchase and my sister adores these and is looking for more as we speak. These stay on all week long. We received all colors as promised, and had no issues with the shipping.</li>
    <li> Received late but it&#x27;s what expected</li>
    <li> shipping was super fast but colors weren&#x27;t what was shown in picture wanted the bright colors got dark colors and bigger then 2mm, but at least they were separated not like the other ones i got from some one else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to count them  but it seemed pretty skimpy, but I can&#x27;t complain for the price, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I feel like I just can&#x27;t get enough gemstones to use for nail art, they are so cute and easy to use, I like the colors and the size.</li>
    <li> These are very tiny and are much much darker than they appear in the picture. I thought they were going to be crystal but unfortunately they seem like plastic :( but they are good size for nail art, not too big. If you want crystal I do not recommend you buying this product but if you don&#x27;t care go ahead</li>
    <li> Love all the colors, &amp; a great price!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is sooooo tiny. But the packaging is very convenient. You just need some tweezers to use them.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to recieve this. The package was wrapped up good, and the stones were all in there own compartiment., They look shiney and cool. The colors pictured are the same you recieve. Good product!!</li>
    <li> Colors look nothing like the pic they are off. Some lighter some darker I guess that&#x27;s to be expected so if you don&#x27;t mind the colors it&#x27;s a great buy for you</li>
    <li> I bought it for my nail lady.  She was happy and liked it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Price is good and it is good gift for nail saloon.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and adding gems, but this gets all the colors mixed up. I try to go into a color and they all get stuck on the top and fall into other colors as I twist to the color i want. I will still use them, but it gets fusterating.</li>
    <li> What was sold as \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; instead charged my card for an extra $25.00. Don&#x27;t get screwed by this scam!! Amazon should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> I got what I wanted, what was described was what I got and when I was told I would get item I did. Very Happy, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Im only giving them 4 star because there not the same color as in the pic and I dont think there is 1200.  But they are still really cute theres still a good amount of them. Perfect for nails. 12 different colors best way I can describe the color is there the same color as in the pic but there darker some of them are light. Overall im a happy customers. I ordered them January 5 estimated delivery was January 30 thru February 18. I got them today January 18.</li>
    <li> my friends and I really love to have this, we are always making different designs with a nice touch of the blink blink...lol</li>
    <li> Happy...satisfy..loved it...only that it took a bit more than expected..but satysfied with it!! My girls loved it and used it all the time.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding, they are far from premium quality, they are like flakes they are so dam small, it&#x27;s a joke</li>
    <li> Nice colors! It does get all over the place into other colors, which is not a biggie because when I go to useit, i&#x27;ll just make sure I grab the right color. Great price too. Even if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, it was only a buck something. ;)</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I expected it would be. Now I am just trying to fill the space required.</li>
    <li> I love it. Great purchase. Lots of variety, great colors, and shimmer. Great bling accent to nails.  xoxo xoxo xoxo</li>
    <li> great color variety.  I love how small the stones are HOWEVER there are not 1200 gems.  More like between 400-600 gems.  The wheel is great as none of the gems spill into other pockets.  But for the price I shouldn&#x27;t complain it was only a couple of bucks.</li>
    <li> Easy to use with a q-tip.  I can conceal the most of it with my clear polish.  They are small enough I can put them on my toenails.</li>
    <li> I just received this today, a week late. There are not 1200 stones, nor 12 colors. I doubt there is even 500 stones in here, and two sections are red (same type of red) , 1 dark green section, 1 dark blue section, 1 dark purple section, 1 black section, 1 silver section, 1 light pink section, 1 light blue section, 1 yellowish gold section, and 1 light purple section. I decided to count them, even though this was time consuming, I still knew I was right there are a total of 532 gems in here. I want a replacement or credit or something! RIP OFF! DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Full containers and perfectly sized for my daughter&#x27;s small fingers.  I think the people saying they are too small are misunderstanding the 2mm size given in the description (I measured them myself).  Took a month to get here since they came from Singapore but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I have not had the chance to use these rhinestones yet because of the tweezers I have don&#x27;t work to well.</li>
    <li> Different shapes and sizes because I though it would be just round stones but all in all i like it because it gives me a variety. I read someone say it was less stones than 1200. I did not count them but it looks somewhere near.</li>
    <li> I just used them today and my nails look so nice and cute. You can put them where you like phone or nails.</li>
    <li> Colors are great and price just right. Item is very small it looks big online but is very small.Bright rich colors.</li>
    <li> Excellent price to pretty nails.</li>
    <li> Very cute stylish case great for traveling to my friends house to do their nails all my stones in one place so they don&#x27;t get lost. Love It</li>
    <li> So i am super HAPPY with this item and how fast it came and i love the free gift!! I ordered mine Nov 20th and it came 12/7/13.. which was super fast compared to most things that come from over seas..honestly it looks like way more than 1200 crystals!!&lt;br /&gt;i will be ordering more to have!!</li>
    <li> I wish they came with directions on how to use these. I want to put them on my nails but theyre kind of bulky. They need to give us a tool to put them on. Not just the accessories. Other than that if you have the tool and knowledge for how to put these on, theyre perfect.</li>
    <li> the picture is sooooooooooooooooo much bigger than the actual thing when igot it it cae in a huge box with a little wheel that is about the width of a iphone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but i love it sooo cute on my nails</li>
    <li> Easy to use as rhinestones on nail art decorations.  Very small, which is what you want, so be prepared.  Good color selection.</li>
    <li> Love these, I like to put a little bling on my nails!</li>
    <li> great price very happy with what I purchased. love the colors was worth the wait. so many colors and shapes to choose from,</li>
    <li> The case is smaller than it appears, but contains a lot of little jewels. Lots of variety in colors as well. They are very easy to apply and look great! the only down side was that it did take a while to get here, but was within the given time frame.</li>
    <li> These are the right size for a very colourful nail design! I used 2 coats of a top coat to make sure they didn&#x27;t catch on anything! Won&#x27;t take long to go thru the 1200 of them! LOL</li>
    <li> I liked it, but I expected to be more  jewels.  It looks as though there were only 10 jewels in each section and look at the picture shown that their advertising, that look like a dozen more jewels to me.  but for the price I cannot complain.</li>
    <li> they are stunning in all ways! They are shiney and they stick perfectly to the nails when i place them. I am going to buy me some more!</li>
    <li> So many rhinestones! Amazing.</li>
    <li> I know these are for your nails but I use them for card making.  Either way this is a great product.</li>
    <li> these are too small havent used any yet. These would probably work on kids nails but not on adult nails!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for over a month almost 2 months for this stuff along with my nail art pens. I&#x27;m actually really getting upset cuz I&#x27;m always doing my nails and cuz I paid for this stuff and I haven&#x27;t got anything the money isn&#x27;t the problem it&#x27;s the fact that I couldn&#x27;t wait for this stuff to come in the mail and I haven&#x27;t seen it bummer!  These people suck! Never order from them! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
    <li> my girl enjoys using them her nails they look great on her nails they are a lot of fun to use</li>
    <li> as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really, really, wanted tiny gems for cardmaking, and this product promised an abundance matched with a good price. I am not disappointed in the product, but I&#x27;ve learned to loathe the wheel they come in. The cheap springs in the center pop out easily after a few turns, and when you turn the wheel to open a slot, heaven help you if you drop it or accidentally hit it! I&#x27;m still finding gems in my medium shag rug. LOL. If you want to try these yourselves, I would recommend finding a good beauty supply store and getting what is called a &amp;#34;Picker Upper,&amp;#34; which is a magnetic wand to pick up nail art. These are so tiny, but you can use dozens on a card and still have some left over. Beats the heck out of the limited number, expensive, craft gems that just don&#x27;t come this small.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 rating because the price is excellent and in my opinion, it&#x27;s the same quality stones most nail salons use. I use this on myself and 6 year old when we want to add sass to our toenail art!!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my nail art. I don&#x27;t mind the small size because I prefer that over the really big ones. The shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described but I wish there were instructions on how to use it because the first thing I did was accidentally break the plastic cover trying to lift it when you&#x27;re supposed to turn it instead. Oops. So I taped it so none will fall out but won&#x27;t be as fun as if it weren&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> Tiny, most likely not 1200 pieces and I&#x27;m not going to bother counting them all. It was cheap so you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Much cheaper then having the nail salons do it for you. They charge $1.00 per gem. And you can do it yourself for so much less.</li>
    <li> This pack offers many more colors that the one I purchased in the past. The price is excellent. I will buy this item again.</li>
    <li> bought them to use for a lip look. stayed on skin with eyelash glue. Variety of colors. took awhile to get but got them in time for what i needed them for</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, got here much quicker than expected, all of the gemstones were in their little compartment in the wheel. The wheel is smaller than I expected, especially since there are supposed to be 1200 of them, but considering how small the gemstones are, it makes sense. I haven&#x27;t counted them, but it can&#x27;t be too far off from 1200 if it isn&#x27;t 1200 exactly. Completely worth it, especially since at my local beauty supply store, it&#x27;s about $20 for 20 gemstones this size. I&#x27;m so happy I decided to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> Loved them! Cheap and you get a lot</li>
    <li> Nice nail rhinestones! Great price</li>
    <li> There was not 1200+ in the package, more like 500+.</li>
    <li> These are so much better than the picture made them look! The color is more saturated, and they are the perfect size for nails. The shipped way faster than  it said they would. A couple of my blue stones got mixed in with the pink but other than that they all stayed in there spots.</li>
    <li> The colors of this rhinestones are so easy to combinatr with the nail art .  It is a must have to make a nice flower of other nail art</li>
    <li> They were just what I wanted and shipped faster than expected!:)</li>
    <li> I ordered this on May 10th and got it on May 28th. Faster then it said it would get here. I can&#x27;t wait to create a lot of new designs!</li>
    <li> I use these every time I do mt nails so freaking cute</li>
    <li> A little mixed up on delivery. But I loved them</li>
    <li> Received sooner than expected but nearly empty !</li>
    <li> Too small of rhinestones like you can&#x27;t even grab them.</li>
    <li> wish it came with glue</li>
    <li> Very Very small and kind of hard to use. I wasted more trying to use them than I was able to actually use. I&#x27;m sure this had more to do with me than with the rhinestones themselves but it was frustrating.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my nail art designs.&lt;br /&gt;Received them a few days earlier than they told me which is good.&lt;br /&gt;I did not count them (way to many) to see if there were 1,200 of them, but there was a lot!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that the colors that are in the picture is not what I received. For example I didn&#x27;t get silver, which I could use, but its not that big of a deal. I did receive very nice colors, just not all of the gems were the same as the picture. Over all good product. I could see myself getting these again. If not the all silver pack.</li>
