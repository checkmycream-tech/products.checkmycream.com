      <li>So I decided to try this and just love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand and type before and remember it being much better</li>
      <li>/&gt;Only more time will tell if I keep using this; I think there&#x27;s a better than 50% chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; but it gives me a healthy shine.</li>
      <li>I love these products.</li>
      <li>I love the cost of this stuff.</li>
      <li>I had to fix the problem and buy more.....</li>
      <li>Since I started using this, my hair is way more manageable and shines more than ever.</li>
      <li>The damage eraser leaves your hair much more manageable</li>
      <li>It makes my hair smell great and makes it much softer.</li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and it does give my gray hair a nice shine.</li>
      <li>For the first time ever, I feel like I have hair as good as one of those girls in the shampoo</li>
      <li>Smells pretty good not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Decent amount of shampoo at a good price.</li>
      <li>This shampoo made my daughters hair look so smooth and shiny that even her friends were asking her what she was using.  </li>
      <li>This product is about the equivalent to tressemes keratin smooth treatment but just a lot cheaper.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this item because my teenager was begging me for it.  </li>
      <li>I used it in the past &amp; it is great!</li>
      <li>shampoo itself doesn&#x27;t make me feel clean.</li>
      <li>yes,as it does clean your hair.</li>
      <li>Super sleek and smooth.</li>
      <li>Garnier Pure Clean is a better option.</li>
      <li>Garnier&#x27;s Sleek and Shine Shampoo gives my hair a clean and full look.</li>
      <li>This shampoo cleans very well and it smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>Unlike some of my friends who are hairline challenged, however, I still have a full head of hair--and that&#x27;s all I got going.</li>
      <li>Overpriced, but useful to increase your discount level of recurring orders, or bumping up to get free shipping.</li>
      <li>I frequently use the Garnier Color Shield too, which is also pretty good.</li>
      <li>Garnier Shampoo is traditional very good item for heircare and so far I couldnt complain on pruduct from</li>
      <li>Luckily it was in</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>First i give 5 stars for the Shampoo!</li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves my hair very silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>I love how soft my hair is now as well.</li>
      <li>It has a great fragrance which is really important to me because I am a &amp;#34;scent snob&amp;#34; when it comes to products you can smell long after you initially used it.  </li>
      <li>(Who knew, right?)</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair smelling amazing all day long.</li>
      <li>If you experienced the same problem, I&#x27;d suggest using Organix Argan Oil Shampoo in the pretty blue bottle.</li>
      <li>This has done wonders for my curls and it is gluten-free at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>So it is entirely possible that Sleek &amp; Shine has more of an effect on thicker hair.</li>
      <li>There was no reason for it to say fragile either, just needed more protection).</li>
      <li>I have a dry scalp and get scabs time to time in the winter and this shampoo really helps to keep my scalp clean and scale free!</li>
      <li>so skip if you want :) Box was bigger then it should have been for one.</li>
      <li>Love this brand of shampoo especially the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Now, if Garnier only made a product that can take off my love handles...</li>
      <li>I am MORE THEN CONFIDENT that IF i returned items, Amazon would have sent me new ones, But it&#x27;s just not worth it to me.</li>
      <li>Was just an okay product overall, didn&#x27;t really see any difference with my hair ( 3c/ 4a/4b textture).</li>
      <li>/&gt;After the first time I used it, I thought that maybe I used too much.</li>
      <li>What a great price for a product that does even better than the expensive stuff my stylist talked me into!</li>
      <li>I have very long hair and periodically feel I need more shine.  </li>
      <li>Does it leave it super soft and silky?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a plethora of different shampoos, everything from cheap VO5, to Aussie, to higher end Fekkai and TiGi shampoos.</li>
      <li>My hair is manageable and, with this product, I really don&#x27;t need conditioner, which saves me cash.</li>
      <li>partner with his curly hair really likes it as well.</li>
      <li>So after trying it I gotta say I really like how my hair felt and smelled.  </li>
      <li>I thought, ok her hair is the complete opposite of mine, lets see how it works in my hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shampoo - Garnier does make great products - I found this sleek and shine makes my hair a little too sleek and flat with no body.</li>
      <li>However, it does seem to build up on my scalp and it initially makes my hair feel oily instead of squeaky clean -- and I&#x27;m not fond of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My normally wavy hair hates to curl it might hold it for 10 min with so much product</li>
      <li>I love Ganier but will try a different type next time.</li>
      <li>Looks like I&#x27;ll have to pay a little more and get it at a normal store.</li>
      <li>It really does make my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Smells good but came broken.</li>
      <li>Not a huge fan, it&#x27;s OK.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good price. I like it i bought like two of these... I buy it again</li>
    <li> Garnier Sleek and Shine Shampoo is a great product.  I have very long hair and periodically feel I need more shine.  I like having a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t seem harsh, does clean and gives the benefit of shine.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 4c natural and I use this to get out all the messy gel, product and buildup out of my hair. It smells great and bought it for the right price. I use it with the other sleek and shine products to get my hair super straight when I blow dry and flat iron. This product is about the equivalent to tressemes keratin smooth treatment but just a lot cheaper. I get about the same results.</li>
    <li> When I use this shampoo, I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo at a great price. However when I opened the box I noticed that the shampoo had leaked all over the bag it was in as well as the box, thankfully nothing else I had ordered was damaged. Looks like I&#x27;ll have to pay a little more and get it at a normal store.</li>
    <li> First i give 5 stars for the Shampoo! I used it in the past &amp; it is great! GOOD ITEM! The REST OF THIS REVIEW is ALL ABOUT SHIPPING so skip if you want :) Box was bigger then it should have been for one. There WAS air bags on top But nothing on bottom &amp; items could still shake around very easily. Since there was no air bags on bottom, during delivery or somewhere the box had to of been thrown or dropped (it did not say fragile so NOT USPS fault! There was no reason for it to say fragile either, just needed more protection). When i opened the box &amp; took out the 3 TINY air bags there was conditioner EVERYWHERE!!! This stuff is NOT easy to clean off of things since it is so smooth &amp; it was a chore just cleaning off the other items i ordered (all shipped from Amazon). My Garnier shampoo was intact &amp; not everywhere. My guess would be that MAYBE this is shipped by Air &amp; the pressure is what squeezed out over 1/2 the bottle of conditioner? Why not the shampoo...? I am guessing it is because the conditioner is so thick...I guess, no scientist here. Thankfully my other items (besides shampoo) were all wrapped in clear bags so no damage from conditioner. ****Now**** When i took my eye-kit clutch (eye-shadow) out &amp; opened it, shadow went everywhere :( NEVER had damaged items &amp; i don&#x27;t want to deal with having to ship back for low cost items. It would cost me more money in gas driving to USPS then i paid for damaged items). I am MORE THEN CONFIDENT that IF i returned items, Amazon would have sent me new ones, But it&#x27;s just not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans very well and it smells fantastic! I love the cost of this stuff. Amazons price is great considering this stuff is almost 5 bucks a bottle where I live.</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Use it every time I wash my hair, almost every day.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It leaves my hair smelling amazing all day long. I have long wavy hair and it is very thick. Since I started using this, my hair is way more manageable and shines more than ever. I love how soft my hair is now as well. This is all around an amazing shampoo and you get even better results with the matching conditioner.</li>
    <li> Overpriced, but useful to increase your discount level of recurring orders, or bumping up to get free shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent of this shampoo. It has a heavy, sweet smell and it also seems to weigh my hair down. Garnier Pure Clean is a better option.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of shampoo especially the smell of it. It makes my hair smell great and makes it much softer.</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my curls and it is gluten-free at a very reasonable price.  It also doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  However, it does seem to build up on my scalp and it initially makes my hair feel oily instead of squeaky clean -- and I&#x27;m not fond of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only more time will tell if I keep using this; I think there&#x27;s a better than 50% chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner with his curly hair really likes it as well.</li>
    <li> Works good for me !! Plus, it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
    <li> makes my hair have dandruff</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Works like shampoo.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this item because my teenager was begging me for it.  Needless to say I think I used it just as much as she did.  This shampoo made my daughters hair look so smooth and shiny that even her friends were asking her what she was using.  After seeing how it worked in her hair I thought, ok her hair is the complete opposite of mine, lets see how it works in my hair.  So after trying it I gotta say I really like how my hair felt and smelled.  It has a great fragrance which is really important to me because I am a &amp;#34;scent snob&amp;#34; when it comes to products you can smell long after you initially used it.  Only problem is that my teenager found out that I was using it and got mad at me because we ran out so fast.  I had to fix the problem and buy more..... would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I had bought this for summer in hopes of de-frizzing my naturally curly hair. I usually straighten it, but the humidity turns it into a huge frizz ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super unhappy with it. While it did control a small amount of frizz, it was overall, a waste of my time. My hair felt gorgeous in the shower after using it. Super sleek and smooth. However, the reason it controls hair in humidity is because it leaves this nasty film too heavy for the heat to lift. After washing my hair, no matter how much I scrubbed or rinsed, my hair was left feeling dirty after it dried. When I blew it out or straightened it, I could feel the residue on my hands, and even see it in my hair. I was almost pointless to even use, as it left my hair looking greasy. I felt like I needed to shower all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I used it, I thought that maybe I used too much. I used a different shampoo for a week with no problem, and then switched back to this one, using a smaller amount than before. Once again, my hair looked and felt dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless the formula is improved, I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. If you experienced the same problem, I&#x27;d suggest using Organix Argan Oil Shampoo in the pretty blue bottle. It has the same concept, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling dirty.</li>
    <li> Just what was expected great product and great shipping process thank you</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan, it&#x27;s OK. Hair isn&#x27;t as soft as you&#x27;d think it would be from the name/description. The damage eraser leaves your hair much more manageable</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shampoo - Garnier does make great products - I found this sleek and shine makes my hair a little too sleek and flat with no body. I love Ganier but will try a different type next time.</li>
    <li> Not upto the mark. Leaves hair dry.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan. Let my hair stripped of oils!</li>
    <li> Product as described. Excellent service. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo cleans your hair. No doubt about that. Does it leave it super soft and silky? not really. Sometimes I feel my hair a little heavy. I do use the Garnier Blow Dry Perfector Straightening Balm, Sleek and Shine, 5.1 Fluid Ounce that complements the product before blow drying and THAT works wonders!. Would I recommend it? yes,as it does clean your hair. Would it leave it like the model&#x27;s hair? no. You will have to use the other complementary products.</li>
    <li> It rinses nicely, does what I want it to do, but the scent is so-so.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my hair, leaves it weighted and dull... works well for a friend&#x27;s very curly hair though.</li>
    <li> The bottle was all slime because some of the shampoo leaked out. Luckily it was in a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself doesn&#x27;t make me feel clean. I feel like I&#x27;m putting oily water in my hair. I&#x27;ve used this brand and type before and remember it being much better</li>
    <li> Garnier Shampoo is traditional very good item for heircare and so far I couldnt complain on pruduct from Garnier&lt;br /&gt;On picutre you can see two shampoo but is coming only one</li>
    <li> Smells good but came broken.</li>
    <li> My hair had more shine before I used this shampoo, it just made my hair look dry and even frizzier :(</li>
    <li> Item is not bagged and not double sealed. Leaked all over everything else in the package. Not recommended for subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I recently got my hair layered and what was once wavy is now fluffy and frizzy! (Who knew, right?) Apparently without the weight holding it down, my hair has a life of its own; and it&#x27;s not a good one. My old shampoo and conditioner aren&#x27;t cutting it anymore; I&#x27;ve been walking around like a dandelion gone to seed. So I decided to try this and just love it (along with the coordinating conditioner). The difference is amazing. This has a nice fruity (apricot?) smell; the matching conditioner is coconut, for some reason, but they work well together. What a great price for a product that does even better than the expensive stuff my stylist talked me into!</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34; this shampoo-my hair is very long and thick-it makes my hair super sleek and a shine like i can&#x27;t believe.</li>
    <li> The product arrived having leaked all over the box twice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and it does give my gray hair a nice shine. Also it has a really good smell.</li>
    <li> Half of the bottle leaked during shipment.... but I do like this stuff in spite of that. Smells good, my boys use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m middle-aged and broke. I&#x27;m out of shape and my teeth are going. Let&#x27;s not talk about wrinkles. Unlike some of my friends who are hairline challenged, however, I still have a full head of hair--and that&#x27;s all I got going. Garnier&#x27;s Sleek and Shine Shampoo gives my hair a clean and full look. I don&#x27;t know if gray can be \\&quot;sleek\\&quot; but it gives me a healthy shine. My hair is manageable and, with this product, I really don&#x27;t need conditioner, which saves me cash. Now, if Garnier only made a product that can take off my love handles...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a plethora of different shampoos, everything from cheap VO5, to Aussie, to higher end Fekkai and TiGi shampoos. I frequently use the Garnier Color Shield too, which is also pretty good. Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine, however, has completely and utterly exceeded my expectations in every possible way. I&#x27;ve put my poor locks through a lot of abuse over the years, specifically from over-coloring it, so I&#x27;m always looking for something to improve my hair&#x27;s condition. Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine is the ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used where I see a dramatic, noticeable difference in my hair. &amp;#34;Sleek&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; really sums it up perfectly. Every time I use this shampoo, it&#x27;s soft and shiny and it flows. For the first time ever, I feel like I have hair as good as one of those girls in the shampoo commercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that, in addition to having over-processed hair, my hair is also very thick. My sister has thick hair as well, and also loves this shampoo. So it is entirely possible that Sleek &amp; Shine has more of an effect on thicker hair.</li>
    <li> This does what it says. Makes your hair shiny and sleek not to mention, soft!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft after use.</li>
    <li> Good lather, excellent cleaning.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Gets rid of oils.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Well its shampoo...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a chemist and I won&#x27;t research the individual components of the shampoo, but it works well.</li>
    <li> Decent amount of shampoo at a good price. Smells pretty good not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love these products. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I get oily hair in the warmer months and this is a good clarifying shampoo,  smells nice.  I hate the design of the bottle though, it&#x27;s so slippery in the shower and hard to use with one hand and your eyes closed, while washing your hair. I will buy again though,  for the fact it clarifies without drying.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I don&#x27;thave to use conditioner when I wash with this</li>
    <li> This is really my favorite kind of shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment.  It really does make my hair soft and shiny.  I like the hairspray, too.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair very silky and smooth. I have relatively thin, fine hair to begin with - but this does not weight it down. It just helps control fly aways. I don&#x27;t usually need conditioner with this shampoo because it leaves it very smooth. Smells great! I love it!</li>
    <li> It takes double the amount of shampoo as herbal essence to clean all my hair (messy layered shoulder length) but it is flat and shinny wit no fly aways and no need for a flat iron but it also keeps my from curling at all. My normally wavy hair hates to curl it might hold it for 10 min with so much product I&#x27;ma walking fire hazard, but since using this stuff it won&#x27;t even fake a real curl for a second.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo! It is super humid here and it keeps it from frizzing!!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo...gives my hair life</li>
    <li> Was just an okay product overall, didn&#x27;t really see any difference with my hair ( 3c/ 4a/4b textture). It also had a great smell but i had to use alot of shampoo in just one wash day, so i wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really cleans deep! I have a dry scalp and get scabs time to time in the winter and this shampoo really helps to keep my scalp clean and scale free!</li>
