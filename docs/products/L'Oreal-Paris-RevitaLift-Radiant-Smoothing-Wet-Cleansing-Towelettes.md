<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these wipes. They smell good and they don&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
    <li> I use these very night before bed and love them!</li>
    <li> Because of having sensitive skin that is often dry and scaly, I have had to try many face cleaning products. Through the years there was just one failure after another. About 2 years ago, I discovered these wet cleansing towelettes. They are perfect for my skin. They leave my skin clean and soft. It leaves no tight dry feeling. These wipes also simplify travel.</li>
    <li> Good points about the RevitaLift wet cleansing towelettes:  1) Stay moist in packet.  2) Easy to pull out from packet. 3) Nice moisturizing action without greasy feeling.      Drawbacks: 1) Scent alert!  If you cannot walk down the detergent aisle at the supermarket or through the perfume section in a department store without getting a headache, beware.  2) Removes make-up at upper surface level. Not good for deep cleaning.  3) The price: before shipping, we&#x27;re looking at a lot for a supply of towelettes that will barely last a month.  Not sure if this is safe around eyes, so  I also purchased the other version that specifies it is okay to use around eyes, which doubles the cost per use.      Neutral point: More wet than moist or damp.</li>
    <li> These are pretty straight forward, moist towlettes that clean your face.  I add a little unscented hand lotion to get off the more difficult mascara and eye shadow primer.  I suspect these face wipes are a big racket and we could all be using cheap baby wipes to do the same thing.  But the subscribe and save price from my beloved amazon is pretty good, so for now, I&#x27;m buying into it.</li>
    <li> I discovered these in the Subscribe and Save shop and am happy I ordered them.  They work well for what I wanted them for, to wash my face before bed.  If I am really tiried I can wash my face with one and crawl into bed.  No rinsing required and I don&#x27;t even really have to put on moisterizer.  The towelettes are quite large and when I am done I use it to wipe down the sink area.  What these don&#x27;t do however is remove make-up.  Or I should say eye make-up.  I rarely wear any though, so that is not a problem.  On the nights that I do I use my Jergins face cream.  Sometimes I will use these in the morning when I don&#x27;t have time to shower.  After I clean my face I can use one to give myself a litle sponge bath!&lt;br /&gt;I use these in conjuction with [[ASIN:B00479FP4Q Olay 2-in-1 Normal Daily Facial Cloths, 66-Count]] which I use in the shower in the mornings.  They both work well together for me.&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Oreal towelettes don&#x27;t come in a case, just a foil packet, but the top ususally stays sealed and in fits nicely in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love the Loreal Revitalift facial wipes.  I have tried many kinds...Dove, Neutrogena, Oil of Olay, Aveno... out of all of them I love these the best.  They moisturize my face while deep cleaning at the same time.  Most wipes leave my face feeling stripped and dry...these do not!  I love them  :)))  They are very soothing and leave my face feeling fresh and clean.  I often find that I don&#x27;t even need to use moisturizer after using them.  And I do not find the scent strong at all...  I would highly recommend these facial wipes to anyone.</li>
    <li> Use them for everything there great!</li>
    <li> Never used these before.  Smells GREAT!  Wipes away  all of makeup, leaves  a Fresh,clean  face :)!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely  going to re buy  again :)!</li>
    <li> I use this product ever day and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better cleansing cloth. I don&#x27;t like those that you have to wet and rinse off so this one fits the bill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually up late and by the time I&#x27;m ready for bed, washing my face seems like a chore.  This has solved all of that.  They are easy to use, clean great, get off my mascara and leave my face feeling clean without any dryness.  I have very dry skin so I follow up with a moisturizer.  They have a  perfumed smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  The wipes are strong enough that you can turn them over and use the other side and they stay intact.  Really like this product.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect little towelette for taking all your makeup off at the end of the day.  They even remove Waterproof mascara.  Easy to travel with as well.  Just pop a couple in a sandwich bag and you are good to go.  Buy these through the Subscribe and Save and you will pay almost 1/2 what they cost at the drug store.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> Removes makeup, doesn&#x27;t make me break ou</li>
    <li> I really like these cleansing facial pads.  Definitely intend to buy again.</li>
    <li> I am on  my second purchase of these.  They work well and seem  to not be as harsh on my face as other wet wipes have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are about the size of a tissue, and they have a soft, but pleasant odor to them. They are nicely wet too, not too wet and not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do keep them in a plastic container after opening just to ensure they stay wet and don&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them even not when taking off makeup.  I use them a few times a week and have not had issues with break outs or dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product is a time-saving little miracle.  With Vitamin C, these towelettes gently remove your daily makeup, even around the eyes, when you are tired in the evening and just want to go to bed.  It saves you time and invites you to use it.  I have them in the bathroom and use them quickly to remove my everyday makeup then quickly I apply my night cream by the bed when I retire.  They work and they are easily incorporated into a nightly routine even when all you want to do is lie down and go to sleep.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s meant to. Smells fresh and it softens my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product,  I leave it beside the bed for night time final cleaning and it is an excellent morning wake up. Some people don&#x27;t like the smell but I find it refreshing and it is relaxing before bed and stimulating in the morning. Good Value.</li>
    <li> One of the better makeup removers I&#x27;ve tried. Doesn&#x27;t dry out and doesn&#x27;t have a scent</li>
    <li> i love these wipes and they make my skin so soft too</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t great either as a facial cleansing cloth or as an anti-aging product, but will do in a pinch if you just need something to remove your makeup before bed. I ran out of my facial cream so decided to try this (since I&#x27;m young and don&#x27;t use a real in-depth treatment) and haven&#x27;t seen any benefit other than it removes makeup. It&#x27;s not great for cleansing and I won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I like the Olay facial towelettes for real cleansing and treatment or the Simple cloths for both exfoliating and as an effective makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I take my foundation and other makeup off with this first, then wash my face.  It will not take every speck of a good foundation off, but, enough with one sheet that it&#x27;s easy to get the rest off.  If you use two, there will only be traces left behind.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and takes of your makeup of  easy. Love it cause you don&#x27;t have a lot of mess or fuss. Makes your face fill soft.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even remember how I took off makeup before Towelettes! :)&lt;br /&gt;So convenient. These are a great price, for the amount you get! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love how easy these are to use at the end of a long day and how clean my skin is after I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite makeup wipes to use. I am a theater actress and removing stage makeup is not an easy task, and this does a fantastic job of it. Most other wipes require 2 or 3 to remove everything cleanly and I find with this product 1 wipe does a thorough and complete job. It is not sticky either and leaves no disagreeable residue. It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris skin care wipes are amazing I used it to clean off my make up &amp; u can used it for all skin types , around the eyes no burning i have sensitive skin and have no problem</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m guilty of not always washing my face before bed.  I leave this on my nightstand just incase.  I love them!</li>
    <li> These whips are my fav. They don&#x27;t dry out my skin and they take off my make-up fairly easily. They&#x27;re a good large size too so you don&#x27;t have to end up using more than one to clean your face, unless you wear TONS of eye make-up, in that case you need to use make up remover first. all in all they are soft, durable, smell great, not sure about the lifting effects, I&#x27;m 29 and don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles yet but I do love them. very good price on here too compared to 2 or 3 $ more at kroger or walmart.</li>
    <li> These towelettes made my eyes burn and water when removing eye makeup. They didn&#x27;t bother my skin though.</li>
    <li> I love this product for removing makeup, and the feel of the product on my skin.  It leaves it feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lazy and after not washing my makeup off while I was young, I&#x27;m getting a little better now, but only because wet towelettes are available! I have tried several. I ordered these on the &#x27;Save and Sub&#x27; program and like them. They are soft and non-irritating to my badly abused sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I returned this item because the towelettes were smaller thinner and dryer than the ones I was used to from Kirkland. They also made my face feel dry and parched. I have reordered my Kirkland brand and won&#x27;t experiment again so matter how good the copywriters make another towelette sound!</li>
    <li> Never makes my skin irritated.</li>
    <li> These are outstanding!  Great job removing ALL makeup, and leave my skin feeling soft and not dried out at all.</li>
    <li> These wipes clean well and leave my facial skin feeling soft and not dried out.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Love the way my face is looking!</li>
    <li> these wipes are great</li>
    <li> Great for a quick facewash on the go or in the evening before applying night cream.  Although scented, gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products for my skin. It is hard to find and I hope the company L&#x27;Oreal Paris can improve its distribution in regular stores.</li>
    <li> Great make up remover.  I went with 4 stars for the deception in the name &#x27;revitalift&amp;#34;  This is a make up remover wipe. Plan and simple.  It&#x27;s not going to lift away wrinkles, fine lines, or sagging skin.  L&#x27;Oreal simply is hoping you will purchase the whole line, implying that using everything will help our aging process.</li>
    <li> I am horrible about removing my make-up before going to bed.  When I&#x27;m tired I just want to go to bed and many times just leave my make-up on (I know that&#x27;s not good but I&#x27;m lazy).  With these towelettes I have no excuses.  Literally it takes less than a minute to take one out and rub it all over my face and eyes to remove all my make-up.  These are really my life savers in make-up removing department.  My pillows thank me for not coming to bed with any make-up on too. ; )</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these but I just don&#x27;t like the overdose of fragrance. Smells like old lady to me and I don&#x27;t see that they have much effect. Granted I am no spring chicken but the negative outweighs the positive for me.</li>
    <li> These wipes do a good job of face cleaning and leave you skin feeling good. They are probably as good as any on the market for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Bought these for mom to keep her 87 year old skin smooth. Turned out to be a good product because she can use them as she sits in her chair, and does not have to bend over a sink with her bad back to wash her face conventionally.</li>
    <li> Good for my sensitive skin. I have tried a few brand. They sting but this one not. Plus loreal dont have a strong smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various cleansing towelettes and now swear by these.  They don&#x27;t leave a residue if you use them without rinsing and my face feels clean and fresh afterward.  I can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore so I buy them on Amazon.  They&#x27;re very handy when camping or traveling (carryon liquid restrictions).  Admittedly, I also use them sometimes before bed when I&#x27;m feeling too lazy to wash and rinse :)</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s important to wash my face before going to bed, but sometimes I get lazy.  I have no excuses now. These have a pleasant scent, remove eye makeup, and are very convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about two years and have seen a marked improvement in my skin! I&#x27;m 63 but could easily pass for 50! This is a keeper for my daily cleansing.</li>
    <li> so easy to take off the make up, and it won&#x27;t let your face feels uncomfortable. like it so much</li>
    <li> I work 12 hour night shifts and when I get home all I want to do is SLEEP.  These prevent me from going to sleep with my makeup on.  Also, I love the scent.  I am so over the \\&quot;scents give me headaches\\&quot; mentality so many people have nowadays.  If you don&#x27;t like these types of things, head to the natural stuff that doesn&#x27;t work as well.  I ordered these on auto-refill and they are a super great deal that way.</li>
    <li> This product works well on my face, leaves it clean and refreshed.  But I wish it left my face a little softer.</li>
    <li> This product removes  make up well. No residue.  Very convenient to use, especially when traveling.  Only one towelette needed,even when I wear full eye make up, foundation, cover up, bronzed and blush.</li>
    <li> I have a case of lazy bones at night and this is, therefore, my go-to face cleaning regime.  I love them and they smell great.</li>
    <li> These give my skin a luminous glow. They remove makeup well. I have dry skin and had no issues with these. Will definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> Love these for freshening up. Small enough to fit in my purse, but also keep packs in my desk drawer, my son&#x27;s diaper bag (for me, not him -- wouldn&#x27;t make a good baby wipe), and on my nightstand. They are lightly scented, but even my (very sensitive) skin tolerates them fine, and I LOVE the scent.</li>
    <li> These cleansing towelettes leave your face feeling clean and refreshed, with no feeling of dryness afterward. They don&#x27;t require water, and are easy to use. They make my skin feel good, never tight or dry. My only complaint is that after a while, the reclosable flap begins to lose its grip, and the towelettes start to dry out. To prevent that, I stored the whole package in a small zip-lock bag.</li>
    <li> Maybe this is just for the face, it irritates my eyes horribly!  I don&#x27;t want it near my eyes.....i.e.  on my face!</li>
    <li> These towelettes not only cleans your face and decolletage, it exfoliates dead skin, moisturizes and nurishes your skin, it removes impuritie and it removes make up easily.  I wear waterproof mascaras and when I put my full face on with everything from primer to bronzer, lip stains, liquid eye liner and these towelettes removes it all and leaves my face and decolletage feeling great.  It is a must have for every womans face cleaning kit.  The price is great and shipping is free.</li>
    <li> This wet cleansing are perfect for me - it is the only way to go to sleep with a clean face and the revitaLift helps the skin , So for me iit is a good solution.</li>
    <li> Great for taking off makeup and moisturizing skin.</li>
    <li> Great make up wipes. It will take it all off and makes your face feel clean and refreshed and ready for moisturizer.</li>
    <li> These wipes have been a morning and evening face-saving short cut.  They removed my foundation, eyeshadow, and mascara.  The ingredients are an excellent gentle chemical exfoliant.  I did find it helfulful to follow-up with a baby wipe moistened with toner, but, it was a preference I developed having been used to using a standard cleansing routine with tons of water.  In the morning if I am really cheating, the baby wipe follow-up in the bathroom (with water) helps remove any little fibers that had stuck to my face during the night.  The towlette will breakdown a bit and leave tiny fuzzies, invisible until I apply foundation. Grrr. I love these wipes and plan to not be without them.  It has improved my skin&#x27;s appearance and made my routine easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side benefit:  these little devils work wonders on my KP arm bumbs and roughness.  I&#x27;ve never had anything work on my arms so well before and I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune trying to keep the back of my arms smooth.</li>
    <li> Removes makeup and dirt easily . Best cloth around ! Use subscribe and save to get the best price monthly</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love these. You just use them in the morning and go! No moisturizer needed, and I&#x27;m saving money! My skin is soft and not dried out.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft.  Don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin, but it removes make up well and cleans the face well.</li>
    <li> 3 Stars for the product, zero for the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The bag doesn&#x27;t re-seal too well. The wipes work ok.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who hates washing my makeup off every night. I leave a pack of these on my bedstand so that I have no excuse to go to sleep without cleaning my face. The towel removes my mascara well, and it has vitamin E that makes my skin feel healthier with each use.</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of wet cloths and these are the best.  I love the way they get all my makeup off without hurting my eyes.  My skin feels so fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few brands but these are my favorite. I&#x27;m always too tired to wash off my makeup, so I keep these right next to my bed and it takes 10 seconds to remove all your makeup. Skin feels soft and my pores look better in the morning when I wake up</li>
    <li> GREAT WIPES !  LOVE THEM !  MY SKIN HADS IMPROVED 100 % SINCE USING THIS PRODUCT ~ SEEM TO HAVE A HEALING EFFECT</li>
    <li> Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now THESE are the cleansing cloths to buy! I recently purchased some off-brand cloths that were very cheap here on Amazon and they were aweful! They were very thin and cheap and just full of alcohol. They burned my skin immediately and smelled terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE have a wonderful smell and are soft do not burn. After washing my face, the cloth was able to pick up trace amounts of makeup left on my face. I am interested to know if these are available with exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Items are great and very pleased thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a long time and have very sensitive skin.  I love using these as they really get the make up off effortlessly and leave my face feeling smooth and clean.  I do follow with night cream</li>
    <li> Removes make-up beautifully! I have been using this now for years!</li>
    <li> Got these as an add on item to reach my minimum for free shipping! Just like any other make up remover you buy in your local store.</li>
    <li> Really removes the daily dirt. Gentle enough for twice a day cleaning and my skin feels soft, not dry when I&#x27;m done.  Still not sold on throwing away a towel or two a day...Will try the face wash as opposed to the towelettes.</li>
    <li> I have been using these a very short time but I can tell a difference in the softness of my face.  It removes makeup completely and leaves your face feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these make up wipes! They don&#x27;t really feel oily and they smell really nice. Skin feels soft after using. Use them every night and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product.  I feel it made my skin soft without irritation.  I use Albolene makeup remover, and follow up with these wipes.  My skin is silky smooth by  morning.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and love the results. The entire Revitalift line of products suits my needs. I follow up the cleansing with either the Daytime Deep Set Wrinkle Repair or the Night Time version depending on whether it&#x27;s the beginning or end of the day. I usually buy in bulk to ensure always having the product  on hand.</li>
    <li> Okay, well, I&#x27;m basically lazy...but I like to take my makeup off before bedtime. Solution. This little pack is tucked into a drawer next to my favorite TV-watching chair. Easy. Removes it all. No mess. Smells nice, but not too nice, if you know what I mean. No sticky residue. Clean face. I like it!</li>
