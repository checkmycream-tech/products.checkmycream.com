      <li>it is great for curly or straight hair..</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B000V0Y91U Swell Volume Full Body Styling Clay / 2 oz]]</li>
      <li>Used this on a male client of mine and he loved it.</li>
      <li>Luckily this stuff works</li>
      <li>More natural look.</li>
      <li>So worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get it here but am buying another jar right now on this site even though the first one is still almost full.</li>
      <li>I started trying other products, but none of them, no not one, could do for my hair what I loved  about Swell Volume..</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and very soft after washing and conditioning - a dab of this styling clay gives my hair the right \\&quot;texture\\&quot; so that my style will hold.  </li>
      <li>my hair is fine and natural curly..</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much either; it lasts quite awhile!</li>
      <li>I recently got it cut into lots of layers thinking I would get more volume that way.</li>
      <li>This is a very good product BUT when my last shipment came, it was dried out &amp; the color was off.</li>
      <li>Can use it on dry hair too but better on damp hair.</li>
      <li>It adds so much volume to my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or tacky at all if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>If you use too much, you may feel some residue.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>It gives your hair body, makes curls more defined and does not weigh your hair down.</li>
      <li>I could fluff up the layers and spray them so that my hair stayed exactly that way or not use hair spray and simply finger comb the top of my hair now and then to get as much volume and texture as I want.</li>
      <li>clay washes right out and my hair feels soft and natural when it is on it.</li>
      <li>only need  a small amount to get good results..</li>
      <li>and wow!</li>
      <li>The only thing is that you have to use it sparingly -- too much and your hair will feel gummy.</li>
      <li>It nearly doubles the volume of my hair..</li>
      <li>They were either ineffective or left my hair really sticky and gummy (or both).</li>
      <li>This product works great for me, not to stiff or hard.</li>
      <li>but you have to be careful not to put too much</li>
      <li>Do not overuse too much or has a tendency to make it have a bit of a wet look, unless you are going for that look.</li>
      <li>I apply a little to damp hair after some Swell mousse and style it to where hair really does look a lot fuller!</li>
      <li>This won&#x27;t give you mile high spikes (I don&#x27;t think) but it will give you lots of volume and texture without the stickiness and unnatural feel of other products.</li>
      <li>When I let my stylist cut my thin, fine hair into layers, she used this product to help \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; the layers and give my hair some texture.</li>

<li> A tiny jar lasts for months, because you only need about a pea-sized amount unless your hair is really long.</li>
<li> It was SO flat.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t give my fine hair volume, poor purchase!</li>
<li> I spent so much money over the years looking for a product to give me volume and texture that wasn&#x27;t hard or sticky and I finally found it</li>
<li> I use about a dime size since my hair is long and that is all I need.</li>

<li> Hair dresser taught me all you have to do is rub a small amount between your palms when hair is wet or alittle bit damp and then rub through sides of hair and back and continue blow drying.</li>
<li> Instead, I looked like a drowned rat when I dried my hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a klutz when it comes to styling my hair, but this product helps add volume to my short and thin hair, and my hair stays where I want it.</li>
<li> This product does help with volume, but it leaves a dull feeling in my hair.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t gummy, overly thick, or sticky.</li>
<li> My hair looked about twice as thick and the layers are separated the way I wanted.&lt;br</li>
<li> and it wasn&#x27;t horrible, just something in a bottle that I wasted money on</li>

    <li> It keeps my hair in the style longer. No frizz. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me, not to stiff or hard. More natural look. Helps volumize your hair to it&#x27;s fullest.</li>
    <li> Great product for fine hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and works! I apply a little to damp hair after some Swell mousse and style it to where hair really does look a lot fuller! I have thinner hair that&#x27;s getting thinner by the day. I have AGA &amp; TE so it&#x27;s not going to come back. Luckily this stuff works but you have to be careful not to put too much or it will get gummy. Takes time to figure the amount and routine but it&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years. I love it. It adds so much volume to my hair. It&#x27;s not sticky or tacky at all if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000V0Y91U Swell Volume Full Body Styling Clay / 2 oz]] This product is wonderful!

    <li> When I let my stylist cut my thin, fine hair into layers, she used this product to help \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; the layers and give my hair some texture. I bought some to take home and now I use it every day. A tiny jar lasts for months, because you only need about a pea-sized amount unless your hair is really long. I use my fingertips to \\&quot;comb\\&quot; it through my hair, and then blowdry. It really works great and it smells wonderful! The only thing is that you have to use it sparingly -- too much and your hair will feel gummy.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product BUT when my last shipment came, it was dried out &amp; the color was off. Looked like it had been in a warehouse way too long.</li>
    <li> Love this! Hair dresser taught me all you have to do is rub a small amount between your palms when hair is wet or alittle bit damp and then rub through sides of hair and back and continue blow drying. It does give volume and lift. You do have to experiment with it abit. Do not overuse too much or has a tendency to make it have a bit of a wet look, unless you are going for that look. Can use it on dry hair too but better on damp hair.</li>
    <li> Great volume clay and a great price.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine straight hair. I recently got it cut into lots of layers thinking I would get more volume that way. Instead, I looked like a drowned rat when I dried my hair. It was SO flat. I didn&#x27;t know what to use on it and tried a few mouses and several styling pomades and pastes. They were either ineffective or left my hair really sticky and gummy (or both). I then happened upon Swell Volume and decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t get it here but am buying another jar right now on this site even though the first one is still almost full. This clay is tan and has a creamy texture. It isn&#x27;t gummy, overly thick, or sticky. I used it on my damp hair before blow drying and wow! I had amazing volume with no flakes or stickiness at all. I could fluff up the layers and spray them so that my hair stayed exactly that way or not use hair spray and simply finger comb the top of my hair now and then to get as much volume and texture as I want. My hair looked about twice as thick and the layers are separated the way I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay washes right out and my hair feels soft and natural when it is on it. I found my holy grail but It isn&#x27;t offered at many retailers so I am stocking up. I spent so much money over the years looking for a product to give me volume and texture that wasn&#x27;t hard or sticky and I finally found it and I&#x27;m not letting it go! This won&#x27;t give you mile high spikes (I don&#x27;t think) but it will give you lots of volume and texture without the stickiness and unnatural feel of other products. You only need a little bit too. If you use too much, you may feel some residue. I use about a dime size since my hair is long and that is all I need. On day two, I just use my damp hands to finger comb my hair to refresh the volume then style as I please. LOVE this stuff. So worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Used this on a male client of mine and he loved it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. if you want something that gives volume and shape but not stuff you want this. Very good service.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter both love using this hair product.</li>
    <li> This product does help with volume, but it leaves a dull feeling in my hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give my fine hair volume, poor purchase! I usually love the Brocato line, but this was a mistake. Will try something else!</li>
    <li> This product is great. It gives your hair body, makes curls more defined and does not weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> I thought it was too dry and sticky feeling, no shine after applied</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, always try lots of volumizing products this one wasn&#x27;t great and it wasn&#x27;t horrible, just something in a bottle that I wasted money on</li>

    <li> I started using this product years ago and loved it~ I bought it at the salon where I had my hair done~Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find it any more anywhere..I started trying other products, but none of them, no not one, could do for my hair what I loved  about Swell Volume..Then I found it on Amazon..did the happy dance..so did my hair!&lt;br /&gt;You only need  a small amount to get good results..It nearly doubles the volume of my hair..no gummy effects with this product, unless you use too much~&lt;br /&gt;it also makes your hair shiney..it is great for curly or straight hair..my hair is fine and natural curly..Perfect!</li>
    <li> Not much body as I had hoped.  Made my hair feel greasy and not much volume.</li>
