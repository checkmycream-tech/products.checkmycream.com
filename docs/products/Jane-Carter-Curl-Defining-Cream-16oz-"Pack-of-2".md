    <li> this is the best curl cream for my wiry texture curly hair.  There is no heavy fragrance!!!  This may not be the right product for you if your hair is curly and fine or this.  My hair is very thick and of mixed texture (wiry to fine)  works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I use it on my 10 year old... Perfect for wash and go during the summer. No residue - ok smell.</li>
    <li> Curl Defining Cream is the only product I will ever use on my curly hair.  I few sprays of Jane Carter Leave in Conditioner and my Curl Defining Cream...done!</li>
    <li> Great product for natural curly hair!</li>
    <li> There is only one word for this product and that is FANSTASTIC. A real solution for dry, stressed curly to frizzy hair. The speedy service is also commendable.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is a completely organic leave-in conditioner, curl enhancing option, which is great for anyone who has natural curly hair and has sweaty works out regularly. It is especially great for everyday for rinsing or washing their hair everyday.</li>
    <li> No matter how thick or difficult your curls are this product whips them in to shape with continued use, I have very tiny curls and generally cannot get away with a wash-n-go style so I apply this product before two strand twisting and it is light enough but also provides great moisture for the style to last a week plus.  I could not get along without this stuff!</li>
    <li> Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Defines curl perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is great with the pump.&lt;br /&gt;Pricing is also correct.&lt;br /&gt;You will be happy if you purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love it...it&#x27;s a super product...I use it in so many ways! Add softness bouncy curls with lustrous shine! Thanks</li>
    <li> Provides curls and no flakes.  The price is competitive and well worth it.  I recommend it to everyone looking for a more natural solution.</li>
    <li> I use this every week after co-washing.  Sometimes use it for my WNGs.  I like it a lot and have added it to my staple products list</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have come across and I&#x27;m a product junkie!  Really defines curls, doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky or weighed down.  Gave a container to my daughter who has fine, curly hair and she loves it too!  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product alone does not define your curls. If you look at the reviews which I should&#x27;ve paid close attention to before I purchased two; you&#x27;ll see that most of the reviewers if not all used Jane Carter Curl Defining Cream in conjunction with another product. The other issue is that this doesn&#x27;t moisturize your hair either. My hair texture is a 3b/3C/ and a little bit of 4A. My hair was frizzy and not soft but not hard either. My hair felt weird. The smell is citrus like. I was hoping it would&#x27;ve been better but it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product as a sample size, and I liked it so I purchased the two 16oz containers. I have long, extremely curly hair that tends to be on the dry side. This cream keeps my hair moisturized and only slightly elongates my curls. The texture is similar to body lotion and my hair absorbs it well without it leaving a white cast. I love this product, but can&#x27;t say I really love the price. I wish it were cheaper, but it does work extremely well for me so I guess that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll justify it. The smell is the strong side, but IMO it smells very clean and similar to eucalyptus. I really like it, but I get how some women might not be into that, especially if you prefer candy scents.  All in all, I will most likely purchase this package again in the future. It arrived within a few days of placing my order and the jars were packed well in bubble wrap and surrounded by foam peanuts.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for naturally curly hair. It does not dry white and you can leave it in without your hair drying. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this for her curly hair, this product makes it so easy to comb through.  She loves this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jane Carter Curl Defining Cream regularly for over four years now.  It helps me to keep my hair healthy and it is not greasy.  I have probably type 4B hair.  I wore my hair natural for the last 5 years and this product made the task easy.  However, I recently decided to relax my hair and the product is still working fine for me.</li>
    <li> This product does what it is supposed to do and it is made from all natural ingredients.  I use it daily and love it.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly dry hair that is unruly. This product mixed with leave in conditioner and the wrap and roll has made my hair look and feel the best it ever has!!! My curls look good even on humid days (although there is still a small amount of frizz). I would recommend to all!</li>
