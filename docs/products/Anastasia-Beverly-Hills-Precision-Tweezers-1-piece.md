      <li>easy to use and with awesome grip even for fine hair.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re just as amazing as always.</li>
      <li>However, these are definitely amazing tweezers.</li>
      <li>Comes in a nice case to protect them</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, these aren&#x27;t perfect but damn near close.</li>
      <li>I received the Anastasia Beverly Hills Precision Tweezers, and the worked great the first couple times i used them, and then itried to use them again,</li>
      <li>Very precise and</li>
      <li>Once you dent or ding the precise edge it will no longer align effectively to grasp hairs.  </li>
      <li>All I have to say is I love these tweezers....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this in Amazon.</li>
      <li>I like these better than my tweezerman tweezers.</li>
      <li>They all seem good at first.</li>
      <li>and I thought they were pretty darn good for a pair of tweezers</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking for a real good tweezers for a very long time.</li>
      <li>I usually only write reviews for all the many great items I buy from Amazon.</li>
      <li>enjoy the feel and weight, yes, the weight.</li>
      <li>have tried just about every notable brand worth trying and these come out on top.&lt;br</li>
      <li>how precisely defined they are.</li>
      <li>I needed some new ones and was very glad to see them wit amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>When it comes time to replace, you will not hear me b*tch about having to shell out $28, because it&#x27;s so worth it !</li>
      <li>and I have a drawer full including Tweezerman, Revlon Precision</li>
      <li>I absolutely the love the shape of my brows and</li>
      <li>If that rare occasion happens to you, just get some 600-1k grit sandpaper and lightly sand</li>
      <li>so I guess I&#x27;ll add these to my cart &amp; hope they arrive quickly before my eyebrows become bushes.</li>
      <li>but I am not sure these were any better than a good pair of rubis or tweezermans.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
      <li>Is it worth it you ask?  </li>
      <li>The 6 year old pair work so much better</li>
      <li>Now she will only own Anastasia Tweezers.</li>
      <li>Also great for slivers and many other medical needs of the sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As for the price, I think it&#x27;s more than fair, considering how much I invested in about 16 different brand tweezers before finally receiving these</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remember having so many problems with tweezers until recently.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re pretty beat up.</li>
      <li>These didn&#x27;t even work long enough to say whether they would have been good for the longterm.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, after a few uses, they became amazing.</li>
      <li>Absolutely, I won&#x27;t disagree with you there.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely...</li>
      <li>They were treated with reasonable care.  </li>
      <li>okay I&#x27;ll admit I like them because they are pink too..</li>
      <li>It might not be much but compare the weight/feel/heft to Tweezerman or Rubis</li>
      <li>About a month ago I did notice they were not pulling all hairs on the first try &amp; then the fine hairs became harder to grasp.</li>
      <li>I notice most reviews stated how you need to be careful not drop these tweezers and how high the price is.</li>
      <li>Sharp, pretty pink, good pinch</li>
      <li>tweezers hold a great edge and if you know how to use them properly...not squeezing to hard, cleaning after every pull, proper storage and knowing when to stop.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
      <li>Just be careful and not drop it-it will damage the fine tips.</li>
      <li>they should be a little more durable than one drop...</li>
      <li>These tweezers will last and are worth the penny.</li>
      <li>However, Anastasia makes a wickedly precise, sharp slanted tweezer that plucks even the finest and shortest of my eyebrow hairs.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s time for a new pair.</li>
      <li>No more cheap tweezers for me!</li>
      <li>Well I honesty use them many times a day, and drop them at least twice a week.</li>
      <li>I dropped them ONE time and they are completely DONE.</li>
      <li>I really feel my splurge on these have actually been a bargain!</li>
      <li>no hair is a match for these pretty pink tweezers.  </li>
      <li>These, at first, were too sharp.</li>
      <li>So be smart, be careful, use the protective rubber tip when storing it and protect your investment.</li>
      <li>These tweezers get the hard ones, the fine ones, the ones you can feel but cannot see...the ones that may not be out enough to pluck...</li>
      <li>No other tweezers I have ever owned received such care...I didn&#x27;t toss them in my handbag like my drugstore tweezers.  </li>
      <li>you use your tweezers almost every single day because you have a wild growing bush of eyebrow hair and need to keep them manicured for your sanity to avoid the unibrow.  </li>

    <li> Sharp, pretty pink, good pinch</li>
    <li> Until I dropped them on the floor and the alignment went off. I&#x27;ve only had them for 2 months but I was doing well with them and I thought they were pretty darn good for a pair of tweezers but after the alignment went off, I was just angry that I had spent $30 on a pair of tweezers and I have to buy a new pair. It&#x27;s funny becase I don&#x27;t remember having so many problems with tweezers until recently. I have written 3 reviews in a few short months. I bought a less expensive pair to replace them. At least I know if they don&#x27;t work out, I can always go back to the anstasia but I am not sure these were any better than a good pair of rubis or tweezermans. They all seem good at first. These didn&#x27;t even work long enough to say whether they would have been good for the longterm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my search for the perfect pair will continue.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is I love these tweezers....I have had mine since July 2008 and today is the day they no longer are doing the job (Dec 2011).  I am back on line to buy another pair. These tweezers have been used every day....yes I am a plucker...I cannot stand a stray hair &amp; my eyebrow hairs are tough to yank.  These tweezers get the hard ones, the fine ones, the ones you can feel but cannot see...the ones that may not be out enough to pluck...no hair is a match for these pretty pink tweezers.  I will tell you that I did keep these tweezers in the box in my make up case- until the box became useless and then I use to wrap them in a cloth for cleaning eye glasses.  No other tweezers I have ever owned received such care...I didn&#x27;t toss them in my handbag like my drugstore tweezers.  They were treated with reasonable care.  I did drop them on my tile floor a few times &amp; in the sink..but they kept on plucking.  My biggest challenge was retreiving them from my daughter, who has since requested a pair as a Xmas present.  About a month ago I did notice they were not pulling all hairs on the first try &amp; then the fine hairs became harder to grasp. Today my frustration grew to the point where I knew I had to pull out my credt card &amp; buy another pair.  I was hoping to find an address to send them in to be sharpened (so that I could have 2 pair)- something I never even considered with my other tweezers..but alas that doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option so I guess I&#x27;ll add these to my cart &amp; hope they arrive quickly before my eyebrows become bushes. I loved these tweezers &amp; I agree $28 is a lot to spend...but when you consider all the other ones I have bought over the years and I have a drawer full including Tweezerman, Revlon Precision, Revlon pointed, slant, straight, splinter, round tip, precision splinter, diamond tip and a host of ones that are only sold at the beauty supply- all were a waste of money compared to these....I really feel my splurge on these have actually been a bargain!</li>
    <li> My favorite tweezers ever, I have now had these tweezers for two years, and they are still perfect. Still aligned great and everything. Very precise and okay I&#x27;ll admit I like them because they are pink too..but like, trust me they&#x27;re wicked good tweezers regardless...</li>
    <li> Boo! Not the same tweezers. I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 years. Can&#x27;t live without them. Best tweezers ever.  But it&#x27;s time for a new pair. They&#x27;ve arrived, and am so disappointed. Totally different feel and point. The 6 year old pair work so much better and they&#x27;re pretty beat up. Argh.</li>
    <li> These, at first, were too sharp. I mean, I bled when I plucked out the first hair...ouch! However, after a few uses, they became amazing. They even got all of those little hairs that my cheaper tweezers couldn&#x27;t even get the tips of. For a class similar to Tweezerman, it sucks that these don&#x27;t get lifetime sharpening. However, these are definitely amazing tweezers. I think, because they don&#x27;t get re-sharpened, I will go with the competitor instead. If Anastasia changes their policy on that, then I will stick with them. I absolutely the love the shape of my brows and how precisely defined they are. No more cheap tweezers for me!</li>
    <li> These were obviously a fake. They never worked!</li>
    <li> It is the best one without a doubt. I&#x27;m so glad I found this in Amazon. Thank you to all the reviewers who helped me decide to buy Anastasia. It is expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Look, I am a dude who shoots guns and backpacks but hell...these eyebrows aren&#x27;t going to maintain them selves ! Also great for slivers and many other medical needs of the sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just about every notable brand worth trying and these come out on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, these aren&#x27;t perfect but damn near close. The sharpness on some had a slight burr, which could cut the hair prior to plucking. If that rare occasion happens to you, just get some 600-1k grit sandpaper and lightly sand away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the feel and weight, yes, the weight. It might not be much but compare the weight/feel/heft to Tweezerman or Rubis and you&#x27;ll notice a difference. That difference is quality and it feels amazing !&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers hold a great edge and if you know how to use them properly...not squeezing to hard, cleaning after every pull, proper storage and knowing when to stop.&lt;br /&gt;From the difference of tweezerman and the savings from rubis... These tweezers will last and are worth the penny.</li>
    <li> This is the best-I have used all other brands. Just be careful and not drop it-it will damage the fine tips.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE BEST TWEEZERS YOU COULD EVER FIND.</li>
    <li> I have bought these years ago and they are the best I have found. I needed some new ones and was very glad to see them wit amazon. If you have some hair you want pulled, these will get it.</li>
    <li> I too LOVED the tweezers... until they were dropped. I dropped them ONE time and they are completely DONE. They do not work at all anymore. For tweezers that are $30- they should be a little more durable than one drop... its not made of glass for heaven&#x27;s sake.</li>
    <li> I like these better than my tweezerman tweezers. Comes in a nice case to protect them</li>
    <li> best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had. easy to use and with awesome grip even for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best tweezers I ever purchased. It&#x27;s worth every penny! I&#x27;m a Cosmetologist, specialized in waxing and I&#x27;ve been looking for a real good tweezers for a very long time. This is the best I found. Thank you Anastasia!</li>
    <li> I have been a devoted Tweezerman slanted tweezer fan for countless years.  I still am, and I still have a couple of pairs.  However, Anastasia makes a wickedly precise, sharp slanted tweezer that plucks even the finest and shortest of my eyebrow hairs.  Steep price you say?  Absolutely, I won&#x27;t disagree with you there.  Is it worth it you ask?  Absolutely... IF... you use your tweezers almost every single day because you have a wild growing bush of eyebrow hair and need to keep them manicured for your sanity to avoid the unibrow.  If this isn&#x27;t you, then buy a Tweezerman for around $10 bucks less.  Oh, and by the way, if you drop them on a hard surface, they are done.  No whining and complaining that \\&quot;they don&#x27;t work\\&quot; if they slipped through your fingers.  Once you dent or ding the precise edge it will no longer align effectively to grasp hairs.  So be smart, be careful, use the protective rubber tip when storing it and protect your investment.</li>
    <li> My wife has spent a small fortune on tweezers over the years. She has tried just about every make and style. Now she will only own Anastasia Tweezers. She says these are the only tweezers that are sturdy yet thin on the tip, and they always grasp the small hard to see hair&#x27;s with no problem!!! Highly recommended!!! You will spend more money on cheaper tweezers that wear out before these even get broke in good!! Save time and money and just buy Anastasia tweezers.</li>
    <li> I usually only write reviews for all the many great items I buy from Amazon. This review will not say &amp;#34;verified customer&amp;#34; under it because they were purchased on Amazon but as a gift my sister, who purchased them for me and herself. I notice most reviews stated how you need to be careful not drop these tweezers and how high the price is. Well I honesty use them many times a day, and drop them at least twice a week. I&#x27;ve yet to notice any shift in the angle of the metal or whatever. They do the job perfectly. As for the price, I think it&#x27;s more than fair, considering how much I invested in about 16 different brand tweezers before finally receiving these and I will never use anything but Anastasia tweezers. I&#x27;ve had this same tweezer for about 5+ years and they&#x27;re just as amazing as always. When it comes time to replace, you will not hear me b*tch about having to shell out $28, because it&#x27;s so worth it !</li>
    <li> I received the Anastasia Beverly Hills Precision Tweezers, and the worked great the first couple times i used them, and then itried to use them again, and they just wouldnt grab the hair? I would like to return them, and get a replacement. Thank you, Debra</li>
