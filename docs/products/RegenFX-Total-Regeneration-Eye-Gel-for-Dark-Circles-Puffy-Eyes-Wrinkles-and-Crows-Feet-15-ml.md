      <li>As long as it continues to work it will be an awesome product.</li>

      <li>I use these types of eye gels more for puffy eyes and fine lines...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles and fine lines, so I can&#x27;t speak to those.  </li>

      <li>This product is easy to use and good on my sensitive eye area!</li>
      <li>My discoloration is gone and some of the fine lines have disappeared.</li>
      <li>and I must admit I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the fine lines between my eyes and crows feet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect to getting that fresh look after a long night or weekend.</li>
      <li>I am wondering why those all reviews are so positive if product is not that effective.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a huge difference around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Giving three stars because gel is not irritating my skin or leaving any kind of residue.</li>
      <li>This is a lightweight gel that goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
      <li>Overall great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to put it away and try it again in the summer when its light weight might be just enough.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received this for review free and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>This anti aging eye treatment is an antioxidant eye gel treatment that protects, hydrates and smooth</li>
      <li>I did receive this product for free in return for my review.</li>

      <li>I have been using this for a full week now.</li>
      <li>The product is okay but did not see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Great product, reduces under eye wrinkles and hopefully in time will reduce dark circles.</li>
      <li>so we will see if it&#x27;s worth purchasing at full price.</li>
      <li>Fast absorbent and goes on easy.</li>
      <li>I have always took good care of my face, but did not realize that eye area (scientifically called &amp;#34;periocular area&amp;#34;) needs a separate/special treatment, Can&#x27;t just dab any facial cream around that region!</li>
      <li>I have many allergies to product&#x27;s and very sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this for a full week now. It&#x27;s light and goes on easily. I have not seen much of a difference being that I haven&#x27;t used it that long. But the puffiness under my eyes have gone down. I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a while and leave an updated review later.</li>
    <li> First off, I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin or any skin conditions. I have been using this product for 3 days and I notice a difference already. Upon putting it on, I felt a slight soothing tingle which honestly relaxed me as I use it at night. I have a dark skin complexion already but the &amp;#34;tired mom eyes&amp;#34; are disappearing slightly and can only look better the more I use it.</li>
    <li> so far so good I look less tired and younger</li>
    <li> This aging eye Gel really helps diminishing The appearance of Lines and wrinkles Recharging tired eyes! I&#x27;m impressed on how much it has worked on my eyes. I work during the night and this product has helped my tired eyes. I would recommend this product for those with dark circles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Great product! Have only been using for a week but noticed a difference in puffiness &amp; dark circles almost immediately. Absorbs quickly but provides good moisturization of my eye area without being greasy.  Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in crow&#x27;s feet but haven&#x27;t been using long &amp; I only have a few small ones. Received this complimentary to test &amp; review - no compensation was provided.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid twenties but have always kept up with washing my face since I was 14! But this eye gel is amazing! You don&#x27;t have to use much.. A little goes a long way and you can see the differnce! I&#x27;ve used it for only about 5 days and can see some results! I will be buying again!! *i received this with a promotional discount*</li>
    <li> I have dark circles and puffiness around the eyes and this seem to do the trick. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is a really excellent product that falls right in line with more expensive regimens, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot! Very impressed with the first few days of use. No side effects or weird textures like similar products. Recommended!</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK AT ALL FOR ME.  Was very disappointed</li>
    <li> My skin is looking and feeling great!  I have very sensitive skin and this product works well for me.  I recommend it for both quality and value.</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight gel that goes on smooth. A little goes along way. Started noticing a change after 5 days. Dark circle under eyes have diminished and if I apply this at night I wake up in the morning with a more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; well rested look around the eye areas. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, reduces under eye wrinkles and hopefully in time will reduce dark circles.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best eye gel (or creme for that matter) that I have ever used. Staying up nights studying as well as all the late nights because of the holidays, I have had dark, puffy, swollen looking eyes. Regen FX has really helped to reduce the puffiness and dark circles that comes along with all of the late nights. It feels wonderful going on and spreads evenly as well as soaks in very well, no oily eye look. Light pleasant smell, spreads perfect, soaks into the skin completely, no eye irritation, and does what it says it will. I will definitely continue to use this eye gel. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
    <li> I see no visible difference.. after 2 weeks of use the pump broke and now can&#x27;t get the serum out of the bottle. This was a total waste of money</li>
    <li> This is a product I would personally purchase again because I liked the way it worked for me! I use these types of eye gels more for puffy eyes and fine lines...this worked just as well as described. This would make a perfect gift to add to a beauty gift basket! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new eye cream to try out!</li>
    <li> The eye gel provides good hydration to my eye area but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it makes a big difference for dark circles.</li>
    <li> Item didn&#x27;t work for me...didn&#x27;t seem to lighten under-eyes nor reduce puffiness.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles and fine lines, so I can&#x27;t speak to those.  But, I was disappointed and sent the product back...through Amazon&#x27;s easy return process.  Amazon is a joy to buy through due to the same.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I will definitely buy it again. Was delivered very fast and saw results within first week of use!</li>
    <li> So far, I have used this product for my eye treatment in the mornings.  The gel formulation is absorbed well and does not cause my mascara to move during the day like heavier  creams did.  I can&#x27;t tell any improvement on my horrendous dark circles but I am waiting for a miracle.  It could happen!</li>
    <li> Been searching for a product that drastically removes, or shrinks, under eye bags on men as advertised or promised. This product stated such and thus far, has not performed as description asserts. The price is too high to risk on false claims. The hunt for a good, economical product continues.</li>
    <li> no results after using for a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for the past 4 weeks. I wanted it to work but my dark eyes have not improved at all. I am still young and do not have problems with wrinkles around my eyes yet nut the superficial lines I do have did not see any improvement either. I am left disappointed. Be warned, It may not work for you.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and I already like it.  I put this on before bed and woke up looking refreshed.  No under eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> Tried this after good reviews and it really seems to have my under eye area looking great. Really seems to focus on minimizing dark circles and delivers on that promise. I can&#x27;t say it helped as much as I would like with my wrinkles, but am overall happy with how the area under my eyes now looks despite minimal sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month. I have noticed a huge difference around my eyes. My discoloration is gone and some of the fine lines have disappeared. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and good on my sensitive eye area!</li>
    <li> I have always had eye puffiness, particularly in the morning.  I really like how RegenFX Anti Aging Eye Treatment helps me with tired, puffy eyes.  It seems that my make up goes on and stays on better.  I&#x27;m definitely a fan!</li>
    <li> I honestly believe I see positive results!  Just one little pump is enough for both eyes.  Completely penetrates immediately.</li>
    <li> As someone that is always on the look out for amazing skincare products that will keep my skin looking and feeling healthy, I was so excited to receive this RegenFX Anti Aging Eye Treatment in the mail!! After testing this anti aging eye treatment out for myself I have to say this anti aging eye treatment is amazing and is definitely does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!! This eye treatment is definitely one of my new favorites!! This anti aging eye treatment is an antioxidant eye gel treatment that protects, hydrates and smooth’s the area of your skin around your eyes. This treatment works wonders at providing you with the protection you need from free radicals while smoothing fine lines and moisturizing your skin!! I personally love the way this makes my skin look and feel after using it!! This eye treatment is formulated with REGENFX exclusive triple peptide complex and key amino acids to reduce the appearance of many aging effects on your skin!! It reduces the appearance of eye bags, dark circle under eyes, puffy eyes and fine lines etc. I personally have seen amazing results after using this product and I definitely recommend this RegenFX Anti Aging Eye Treatment to everyone!!</li>
    <li> did not work as well as expected..</li>
    <li> I have just started using it so I have not seen the results that is said I the literature.</li>
    <li> Eyes looking better and love this product.</li>
    <li> this product works . you should give it a try</li>
    <li> I have been using as directed for over a month but don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> this works really good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer, I absolutely love this product. Best eye gel on the market. After a decade of serious anti-aging eye gel/ cream exploration, this is my top choice!</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; product that has really seemed to work. It&#x27;s not miraculous, but it does seem to lessen small wrinkles around the eyes and also help with under-eye puffiness. It&#x27;s very light and goes on easily; a little bit goes a long way. I hope that over time, my results are even better! But I definitely recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Received this just 2 days ago and I can already tell a difference within my eyes! This stuff really works! I was skeptical at first but after trying it I am sure its going to be a winner!! I can not wait to see the results after just a week!! I would recommend this product to anyone who is not happy with your aging eyes!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream, though I do think it&#x27;s a big pricey. For the modest improvement in my dark circles, I do think it&#x27;s worth it. I use this along with the RegenFX moisturizer which I love and the RegenFX Hyaluronic acid serum which is good but should be used sparingly.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews I ordered RegenFX Anti Aging Eye Treatment for my puffy eyes. It is almost two weeks and I am using it two times a day, but I don&#x27;t see any difference on my puffy eyes :( I am wondering why those all reviews are so positive if product is not that effective. Giving three stars because gel is not irritating my skin or leaving any kind of residue. I wish this product could have solved my problem :(</li>
    <li> good product. i liked it a lot better than the last serum i was using.</li>
    <li> I have used it for almost a week and I truly love it.  I have puffy eyes due to a over active thyroid condition and when I use this in the morning my eyes feel so much better and the eyes are not as puffy.  Price is good on this product also.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was reading the excellent reviews and got really hopeful this would be THE answer to the problem of dark circles under my eyes. Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t make any difference, the skin around my eyes look exactly the same from before I started using this. Sending it back and I am extremely disappointed, really wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> This eye treatment is amazing. I have tried all different kinds of eye gels and creams. This is the best one yet. It absorbs quickly, I am really seeing some improvement where I wanted to. It is very moisturizing and has a wonderfully light scent. It also feels cooling around the eyes. It is gentle and friendly for all types of skin. I have dry skin and it has really helped to retain moisture in my eye area. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference this product has made.  I intend to give it a little longer because I keep thinking I may not be applying it correctly or that it may take a little longer because I am not a young person any more.  It is very easy to apply if I am doing it correctly (simply putting a small amount on my finger and applying it to my under-eye area).  I had previously ordered a product that you had to mix with your makeup and wait for it to dry before moving your face for 10 minutes and I was not happy with that at all.  Your advertisement made it seem so simple but as of yet I have not seen any improvement.  Will wait a little longer to decide how to really rate the product.</li>
    <li> Wow! 60 yr. old male. Always self concieous about puffy &amp;#34;allergy eyes&amp;#34;. This works and you only need 1 drop for both eyes!</li>
    <li> I do believe that this product has helped reduce the dark circles under my eyes. The price point is reasonable, and it&#x27;s lasted quite a while. I&#x27;d try it for sure, especially if everything you&#x27;ve tried at the grocery store has not been helpful.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I waited until I used the product  for a week before writing any review.  I have many allergies to product&#x27;s and very sensitive skin.  I was very excited to try this product but hesitant as I usually have issues after day 2 to 3.  Well after a week of using all three product I am excited to say I can feel a huge difference in my skin hydration.  I have less wrinkles-cracks from the dryness.  I have used the products together and would say jump in!  They are great!  Not one issue with irritation and the softness of my skin is pretty remarkable.  My husband even noticed the difference!!</li>
    <li> A good product. Fast absorbent and goes on easy. Like others said it does give a tightening sensation when you first put it on but is not unpleasant at all. I have been using for a few days and have already seen some improvements. As long as it continues to work it will be an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE TO REVIEW: I really like Regen-Anti Aging Eye Gel. I can feel it working, tightening and bringing down the puffiness around my eyes. My eyes look and feel better. My dark circles are less noticible and my makeup goes on smoother</li>
    <li> The product is okay but did not see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> This product burned when I put it on and dried out my skin to the point where after 2 days the wrinkles around my eyes were actually noticeably worse rather than better.</li>
    <li> I guess my puffy eyes were too long gone. Just did not work for this old lady.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of good reviews I decided to guve it try, I have dark circles under my eyes,  I&#x27;ve been using a lot of stuffs but nothing seems to work not even this I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and I haven&#x27;t notice any changes</li>
    <li> Does exactly what a good HA serum should do. My skin’s elasticity seems to be improving. This serum has been tightening my skin and keeping it nourished. I feel that this company makes this product with extremely high quality ingredients and I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> I was given the RegenFX Anti Aging Eye Gel for Dark Circles, RegenFX Ultimate Hualuronic Acid Serum, and RegenFX Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream for free to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using all three products as a system for a few weeks now and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I&#x27;m a 45 year old woman who has little by way of wrinkles, but there are a couple of trouble spots that I was hoping this would help - some fine lines on my forehead and between my eyes at the bridge of my nose. There does not seem to be any difference in the appearance of those lines. The biggest disappointment, though, is the way this product feels on my face. It feels, after it dries, like having a thin layer of dried glue on my face. It is not a pleasant feeling for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is even when it&#x27;s coupled with the Moisturizer Cream. This cream is nice and light and has a lovely, herbal-minty fragrance that is not overbearing. But, it does not seem to be a great moisturizer for me. I&#x27;m going to put it away and try it again in the summer when its light weight might be just enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Gel has done nothing for the dark circles around my eyes - bear in mind that I think the bulk of my problem there is genetic. The gel is nice and soothing after a long day, however.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fantastic! Around my eyes there &amp;#34;were&amp;#34; color inconsistencies with the rest of my facial skin, darker area and some puffiness &amp;#34;were&amp;#34; more apparent now that I turned 41 (Lets be clear, &amp;#34;WERE&amp;#34; is being used for a reason!).  I have always took good care of my face, but did not realize that eye area (scientifically called &amp;#34;periocular area&amp;#34;) needs a separate/special treatment, Can&#x27;t just dab any facial cream around that region! I have learned that The skin around the eyes is ten times thinner than the skin on the face. As we age, skin loses its elasticity and becomes even thinner due to a breakdown of collagen. Every smile, every expression ages you (10,000 movements per day) as I mentioned in this review title.&lt;br /&gt;As a analyst in my profession and a health junkie, I like to do my homework and finding best solution to my problems. Tried different products to fight my age related periocular region, trying to get rid of puffiness, some fine lines and inconsistent color with rest of my face, some actually worked for me, but when trying different topical solutions I accumulated a lot of knowledge what ingredients work, and which don&#x27;t. This serum has top 2 ingredients (and then some) that target all my concerns: plant stem cells, vital amino acids a building block for life, and regenerating properties and of course a proven ingredient caffeine which reduces puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;So lets look at:&lt;br /&gt;#1 Amino Acids, or more direct word &amp;#34;Peptides&amp;#34; - It basically stimulates growth and buildup of collagen which you want in such a delicate and thin skin around the eye. More collagen means your skin can retain more water.&lt;br /&gt;#2 Plant Stem Cells - It&#x27;s main benefit is anti-inflammatory properties and it protects skin cells, and it also protects the collagen from breaking down. Results are younger looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product works right away, I have seen results in a week or so. Morning and night, serum is lite, refreshing and the skin will soak it up like a sponge. Make sure you dab not rub! My color consistency improved with the rest of my facial skin, puffiness (or tired look) went away and it feels more flexible, more relaxed. Product I not cheap, but the bottle will last you a long time, GET IT!!freshing and the skin will soak it up like a sponge. Make sure you dab not rub!

    <li> I just received this item yesterday but I&#x27;ve used it twice.  So far I love it!!  I only paid $1 for it on Snagshout to try it out so we will see if it&#x27;s worth purchasing at full price.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I bought it because it had over 200 positive reviews. I should have realized all those reviews came from people who were given the product for free for a good review. I paid for the product out of pocket and have been using it for s month with NO changes whatsoever. I would not recommend this product. Next time I will listen to the Google reviews for eye products rather than Amazon :(</li>
    <li> I think this is gonna be an alright Eye Gel! I was sent this RegenFX Anti Aging Eye Gel and it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell but it is bearable.&lt;br /&gt;I do get the tingling feeling and the tightening, so I know it works. I haven&#x27;t tested it long enough to actually see results, but I do think that if I was to continue, I would! I dries pretty quick, I like that, I hate waiting! I would recommend this to someone looking for an Eye Gel.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product, so I will provide an updated review with my results, but I am anxious to see the results. Unlike other eye serums, RegenFX has mastered their formula to prevent a sticky residue. It has helped with bags under my eyes, but my main concern is dark circles. I know that will take longer to fix, so I will update with what I hope is promising results!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I am going to write for this.  I just got this in the mail today so this my review is only for one day.  I noticed that my eyes look brighter.  When I went to work ( I am a night shift nurse), people were asking me if I got more sleep than usual, that I didn&#x27;t look tired.  That right there is a plus.  I gave this product only four stars because it&#x27;s only been one day, as I continue to use this product I will write another review.</li>
    <li> Good product that seems to be working like it says it does. It feels like it&#x27;s a good quality!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast results.</li>
    <li> A little goes a log way with this product! Only half a pump is needed. Seems to work pretty well at brightening up the eye area, however, it did make my eyes water a bit after application. I made sure to not get it in my eyes, but still had a slight sensitivity to it. I did receive this product for free in return for my review.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My eye wrinkles seem to be disappearing!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the results, this worked better than I anticipated. If you have sensitive skin test a small area first. Would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> They started askin for reviews before the product was even delivered. I used it for 4 weeks and saw nothing... absolutely nothing...</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m very impressed. I bought this product because of the good reviews and I must say i was not disappointed; It&#x27;s the only eye cream that has ever worked for me with my puffy eyes. I tried many different ones in the past and kind of gave up; I even ended up thinking it was worse with any kind of cream than no cream at all. This gel was kind of a last try. It really really decreases puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my under eye darkness...</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for me. It has nice packaging and smells fine, but after I washed my face after wearing it all day, my eye sockets and tops of my cheek bones were covered in tiny red splotches, it almost looked like broken capillaries. I wore it in conjunction with the moisturizer (as I received the trio for review) so I&#x27;m not entirely sure which product did me in. The splotches took days to clear up. I didn&#x27;t notice anything in the ingredients that would give me such a reaction, but I was scared to try it again. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about a month now and I must admit I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the fine lines between my eyes and crows feet. I use a 10X magnifying mirror to put on my eye makeup so I can really see the difference. It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but after several weeks for me. I will buy more once I begin to run out.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work and stung my eyes. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I am surprised how well this works! It really smooths my eye area, feels soothing and prepares my eyelids for makeup. My eyeshadow seems to cling well to it and not crease as if this is a primer. I bought this to &amp;#34;tide me over&amp;#34; until my much more expensive eye cream was back in stock, but I might not need that one, because I like this one. I am 56 and always looking for ways to perk up my eye area and diminish wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I tried this out as a sample and I must say it made my eyes look very awake. They have a nice glow and smoothness to them and I will defiantly buy this in the future!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product, I can see instant changes to my dark circles (from kids! Ha!) I would recommend this to anyone who needs it!</li>
    <li> So far I am liking this product</li>
    <li> This gel goes on very smooth and absorbs well into my skin. It does not leave a sticky/paste-like residue. It made my under eye area feel very moisturized and I will continue to use the product. I will update when I have had the time to test for anti-aging properties.</li>
    <li> OMG! Zero puffiness! I look way better waking up in the morning. I don&#x27;t feel like I look like a dead zombie anymore. It is a life saving product! One that is a must have in my book. Never knew what a miracle this was. (:</li>
    <li> I started trying this eye gel and have found one that works! This cream is clear and is alittle thick, not runny. It took away 2 deep crows feet that I&#x27;ve had and that surprised me. Nothing I have tried has done that. It also helped in plumping up the hollow look and thinness of my lower eye. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough! Thanks! I received this product in exchange for an honest review. It&#x27;s part of my daily regime now!</li>
    <li> The product is good and feels great when is applied to the skin. Till now the product has been used twice and is really soon for a review. I will use it for at least a week in order for me to do a great review</li>
    <li> I received this for review free and would buy it again. this is a great product thanks</li>
    <li> This eye gel is great. Upon application it skins right into my skin. After two weeks of daily usage before going to bed I&#x27;ve noticed that my crows feet are all virtually gone, I wake up looking more refreshed in the morning and my eyes aren&#x27;t puffy anymore. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Works great on circles and puffiness. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received this eye cream I started using this on one eye only, to compare and see if I could see a difference within a week !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It visibly reduces the size of the bags below my eyes and more over my under eye circles were also diminishing, and this product lasts.Its amazing!! I applied the gel prior to my moisturizer and let it dry along with the vitamin C serum (which I didn&#x27;t apply near my eye area). Then applied my make up normally after my moisturizer dried. So it stayed all day and I followed the same process in night along with night cream.&lt;br /&gt;Now am applying on both eyes, as this passed my test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many expensive products. I am going to love this one!!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect to getting that fresh look after a long night or weekend. I have noticed a significant change in the swelling and darkness around my eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have a newborn so I have some puffy eyes and this gel really makes a difference. I would definitely recommend!</li>
