      <li>This brush is also so lovely I can leave it out without it sticking out like a sore thumb with the rest of my things.</li>
      <li>The brush glided through my hair with no problems, the widen paddle helped more with my hair.</li>
      <li>Bella and bear paddle brush love it  </li>
      <li>so cute.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t tangle, pull or break the hair off and the design is simply adorable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome brush!  Love the vintage look of the paddle brush and love the way it brushes my hair. I have thick wavy long hair that usually gets super frizzy if I brush it. Not with this brush.  It&#x27;s combs through my hair without pulling and no fly aways.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I bought this because I thought it was pretty, and was not expecting much.  However, the brush is very nice and is effective when trying to blow dry my hair (which is unruly on its best day).  My only complaint is that cleaning the brush of hair is a bit of a challenge.  But I chalk that up to the kind of brush it is, and not to a specific flaw in this particular product.</li>
    <li> The first impression this brush gives off is pure beautiful with printed screen on pink and white roses on top of a white poka-dot background already adorning this Tiffany and Company like blueish green hard plastic outer casing. The brush area is made of a soft and flexible air cushioned natural rubber pad and ball ended nylon pins making for a gentle and effective pass through all hair types from thick to thin and adult to child. Plus, with the way the bristles are finished it allows them to stimulate and massage your scalp making brushing your hair no longer a boring task but a stress reducing task. Being made from these materials as well helps to keep your hair static free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella and Bear has a winner on there hands here I feel. I really love the colors and the way that the brush is designed. But I did fear I would break it with how thick my hair is most the time, however it did not it went through just as easy as my Goody brush (similar to this brush) does. I did have a problem with my bristles the very bottom middle ones were a little bent on the last row, but it does not hurt be or disrupt my brushing. I love the shape of the handle it feel great in my hand, it does not feel like it is going to break right off and it does not feel like I might drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is still a large durable brush and if you keep your eyes open or join there club which I believe you can find out more information on that at Bella and Bear plus, you can see all of there other wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I received this for free as one of Bella and Bear trial testers, and was quite satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself was bigger than I was expecting, and I while was afraid that the print would seem too cheap based on the product photo, it looks much higher quality in person. I have fine hair a bit past my shoulders, and I think this brush would be far more suitable for someone with long, thick hair. The distribution of the bristles were somewhat wide, so it just flowed right through my strands and it didn&#x27;t necessarily feel like I was actually &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; anything. I did notice an increase in shine and smoothness after running the brush through a few times, though. If you have hair like mine, it might be a better idea to go with a boar&#x27;s hair paddle, etc.</li>
    <li> This is such a lovely brush - I ordered it for myself but it&#x27;s the kind of thing I&#x27;d buy someone as a gift, it&#x27;s just so pretty!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Only gave it four stars because there are cheaper ones that work exactly the same. I love the print though so it was worth it. But it&#x27;s nothing special except for the pretty print.</li>
    <li> I have always tend to buy inexpensive hair brushes, they say durable but I could never get the brush through my hair. I even tend to break them sometimes, I have thick hair and it is sorta short. I was super excited to be able to review this brush. I wanted to see if a little pricey cost would make a difference. In my household each person has there own brush, I will not share one with my girls and I sometimes don&#x27;t even like my husband using my brush. I feel like its a personal product. When I got my brush in the mail I was stoked , I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, and boy I was glad I was chosen. After, the first use I couldn&#x27;t believe it. The brush glided through my hair with no problems, the widen paddle helped more with my hair. After, using it my hair felt soo soft and incredible, my husband was able to glide his hands through my hair with no problem. I know I will be spreading the word about this brush, Price is worth more for beauty when it comes to my hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this the moment I got it last night and my hair looked significantly better! Love this brush! A must have for any female no matter the length of your hair! Love love LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Super cute, perfect size, does an awesome job w/o damaging hair .</li>
    <li> I received the product for free on behalf of the company&#x27;s club&lt;br /&gt;what can I say I have thick hair and its very hard to find a brush that can last and this one truly does the girly floral pattern. Its so cute and chic I love it I own several Bella and bear products and have not been disappointed yet! I cannot wait until I own and collect them all</li>
    <li> Nice. My girls (5 and 8) love this design. And good quality!</li>
    <li> Bella and Bear knows how to create adorable products. I am such a design lover and when I see cute packaging I feel like I have to have an item. I was really excited to get this paddle brush. It&#x27;s so cute and works great. The brush is nice and big so it&#x27;s easy to brush all my hair quickly. This brush is very well made. The brush does not irritate my scalp at all. It&#x27;s great to use while blow drying my hair too because of the size. It pulls and tugs a bit at my wet hair with knots but it doesn&#x27;t hurt like other brushes I have used. It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and I really do love using this brush! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Wife loved it so I bought another for daughter</li>
    <li> Love the brush!!  Leaves a smooth finish to my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is great!  Excellent for very very thick hair.</li>
    <li> It is just as adorable in person. It was one of those purchases I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; but I am SO happy I went for it!! It&#x27;s the little things that make me the most happy and having a super cute brush-why not?? You have to use it everyday and it&#x27;s cuteness makes me smile :) Also is true what they say-leaves my hair smooth and helps get out the tangles (I have really fine hair and am prone to the rat nest in the back of my head). Thanks Bella and Bear!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this paddle brush for a very long time. So when I came across a great discount/promotion I couldn&#x27;t help but purchase it. I am so incredibly happy I bought this paddle brush. It&#x27;s so amazingly stunning and beautiful. This is not the kind of brush you will want to store in a drawer or closet. It&#x27;s so pretty that you&#x27;ll want it displayed on your vanity, dresser, or bathroom counter. The floral print and color choice is wonderful and gives it an extra feminine look and feel which I love. Not only does it look nice, the brush easily goes through my long hair. I tend to get knots in my hair and this brush goes through fairly easy compared to other brushes I have. It&#x27;s also pretty large (which you can see in my photos) and very nice quality. I normally wouldn&#x27;t give a hair brush as a gift to someone but I would make an exception for this one as it&#x27;s so beautiful.</li>
    <li> GREAT brush! The design is so adorable, it matches some of the other products by this brand which I adore. It definitely is gentle on my thick hair too.</li>
    <li> Love my new brush ❤️ Its make me want to brush my hair often. It&#x27;s works great with the detangling comb.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter for her birthday and she LOVES it! She can&#x27;t wait to take it to middle school. 😎😎</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love this brush, so much that I should probably order us a second one! It doesn&#x27;t tangle, pull or break the hair off and the design is simply adorable. I have a few Bella&amp;Bear products and I think they have some of the cutest designs and packaging out there.</li>
    <li> I used it on my daughter who has long but straight hair. She said it pulled and she didn&#x27;t like it. So I decided to keep it and use it on myself. The brush separated from the paddle on the second use. Was really disappointing!!</li>
    <li> I love the vintage look of it which matches my vanity decor. Would love to see a hand mirror to match. The paddle brush is larger then I expected and meant for thick long hair.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my hair the first time I used this brush. My hair has become silkier, smoother, and is a lot easier to brush in the mornings! This brush is also so lovely I can leave it out without it sticking out like a sore thumb with the rest of my things. Highly recommended! Works better than any brush I have ever used before.</li>
    <li> Three stars, not exactly good.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair brush.  It actually massages the scalp when being used.  Never had a brush ever do that before.  Great gift idea!</li>
    <li> Love my new brush. I have thick and alot of hair. It&#x27;s also wavey. It does the job with style.</li>
    <li> Great price for a really nice brush. The quality of this brush was very good and my daughter loved it! I would definitely buy more of their products in the future.</li>
    <li> Have given 3 of these for birthday gifts to ladies who have everything.  They all loved them ~  Now I want one !</li>
    <li> The brush works well and is very pretty. It is a bit large for my taste, but perhaps the designation &amp;#34;paddle&amp;#34; brush means by default that it must be very large. If they made a smaller one of the same design (not the funny-shaped detangler) I&#x27;d be very happy.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hairbrush that feels oh so nice!  Doesn&#x27;t pull and is bigger than expected.</li>
    <li> so cute. I&#x27;m a girly girl so i&#x27;m a big fan of cutie things. at first this might look like something you give to an eight year old but in person it&#x27;s not as child looking as i thought. it&#x27;s actually a very pretty rose design. love it, and i also ordered the comb and detangler brush set. after seeing this i can&#x27;t wait to get my comb and brush set.</li>
    <li> The bristle insert fell out the first time I used it, tried a few more times with the same result. Will be returning this.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush.  I have very short hair and it works great for me.  Feels like a massage on my scalp.  Hair also feels softer.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Used this brush TWICE and it broke.  The bristles came right out of the handle. I can&#x27;t return because the date has passed.  DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS!  They are super cheap!</li>
    <li> Cute packaging.  It curls the eyelashes nicely, but the rubber keeps falling out and I have to search in my makeup bag for it each time I use the curler and put it back in.  That is a real annoyance to me and I will not order the product again.</li>
    <li> This brush is so pretty and does a great job combing through my 3yo daughter&#x27;s hair. I used to use a comb, but this is much better. I would have rather purchased the smaller brush/comb combo set, but don&#x27;t really like the slogan printed on the comb. The vintage floral print and Bella and Bear logo are cute, however.</li>
    <li> The brush is very nice but pulled out more hair than my boar hair paddle brush.</li>
    <li> Love my Bella and Bear Paddle Brush! It&#x27;s so pretty and leaves my hair shiney and manageable!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! From the cute packaging and adorable polka dot and roses design I&#x27;ve just fallen in love with it. Really smooths out my hair and it&#x27;s just so gosh darn pretty to look at! Totally vanity worthy. I highly recommend this brush. Popped up a little review of it on my blog for all to see how wonderful it is. http://www.cherrylipsblondecurls.com/2015/04/review-corioliss-tangle-teezer-and.html</li>
    <li> Now aside from this being totally adorable, it is well made, constructed so the bristles won&#x27;t pop out. You all know what I mean right? You buy a new brush, use it a few days, go to clean the hair out of it and out pops the rubber part with the bristles attached. Oh and if you have thick hair like my daughter, sometimes they just come out while brushing! Well one of the first things I did when I got this Bella and Bear Paddle Brush was to try tugging at the bristles. Then I took my fingers and pushed down around the edges of the rubbery part that holds in the bristles. I could not make it gap or come out. Now granted I did not want to break my new, I mean my daughter&#x27;s new lovely brush so it is not like I tried getting it out with brute force, but let&#x27;s just say I feel this brush is made well.</li>
    <li> Not only is the brush pretty, but it really does make your hair shiny.  Comfortable to use, and not cheap feeling at all.  HIghly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of my hair lately, due to stress. With this brush, I&#x27;m losing less than with my others when brushing my hair. I&#x27;m hoping it will help preserve what is left, and I do like the comfort of the brush&#x27;s bristles. It&#x27;s nice and gentle on the scalp. I don&#x27;t want to be without this brush ever again!</li>
    <li> A great brush.. thank you. I feels good in the hand and on the scalp..please tell Bella and Bear I am quite pleased. Purr-fect!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it it actually breaks fast buy a wooden brush instead</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush!  I have long wavy, fine hair that tangles easily and this really helps.  Gives a nice smooth blowout.  Also it&#x27;s just so cute :)</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES this brush!! It&#x27;s beautiful and makes her hair super shiny with no frizz. :)</li>
    <li> Very pretty paddle brush.  It works well. It would make a nice gift. It came in a very sturdy and pretty box. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Holy bleep my hair is bleeping shiny bleep bleeping bleep!</li>
    <li> Bella and bear paddle brush love it  I have fine hair but this brush is the business I recommended to anyone my cousin daughter loves it she wants one so bad I got this free of charge the best hands down</li>
    <li> Super cute! Love the vintage print on this brush! Works great! Feels great on the hair and head. The only reason for five stars is on one side of the brush a few rows of the bristles are kind of smashed together. I tried to manipulate the shaping of the bristle base to fix it but, it&#x27;s a no go. It doesn&#x27;t really affect the use, just visually bothers me. Still happy to pick this up during a promotional offer.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much nicer once using this brush. My hair is always knotty and I explained up above and I also have quite thick hair and It certainly detangles my hair. I do also have the problem of my hair going static after brushing it but my hair never goes static when using this hairbrush. It is like magic! I have only used it a couple of times whilst blow drying my hair but I used it the other day and I did not even need to straighten my hair because It was already quite straight. It feels nice on my head unlike others because some scratch my head but I definitely understand why they said it is great for massaging your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read full review here: http://withlovetiff.co.uk/paddlebearbrush/</li>
    <li> This brush is really awesome! It has a very cute design, and it doesn&#x27;t pull hair or cause pain. I certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> So you think a paddle brush is a paddle brush, they must be all the same?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG! This paddle brush not only detangles my long unruly hair with ease, it also helps keep the frizzies away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight, it feels great on the scalp and it gives me maximum control when I am blow drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than how excellent it works, its just so incredibly cute. It is a light blueish green with a floral print, it is much cuter than the average brush you would buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella and Bear makes many awesome products, I love their packaging designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The Bear Brush by Bella and Bear is a large, paddle brush that glides easily through hair. It is a nice brush, seems to be well made and sturdy. I love the the design on the brush as well as the feel of the bristles. The design is light blue with small white polka dots and a bunch of pretty roses. It is very feminine looking. The bristles have coated tips so the brush is gentle and won&#x27;t tug or snag your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see I have been using this brush regularly. Hair included in the photo lol. This brush really feels good, it doesn&#x27;t scrap my scalp or irritate my skin. Also the bristles are wide which makes it easy to clean the hair out. I can reach in the bristles and pull the excess hair out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it really seems to smooth my hair very well as I brush it. Makes my hair look and feel nice and silky. It really does a fabulous job and it is totally static free! I love this brush and I am so happy to get to use it everyday. I highly recommend it. So happy I got to try this in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> love this pretty brush.perfect for long hair!</li>
