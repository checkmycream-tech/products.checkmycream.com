      <li>There wasn&#x27;t any burning or breakouts of any kind.</li>
      <li>I had read somewhere that the best enzyme peel for people with sensitive skin - that&#x27;s me!</li>
      <li>Overall this is a great product by a great company</li>
      <li>I was looking for a chemical peel for my face that was very light and could be used weekly without causing peeling.  </li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>the texture is better.</li>
      <li>I have found that over the months of usage I have become more tolerant to the tingle, and if I don&#x27;t feel it</li>
      <li>I did the patch test twice to make sure my skin could tolerate this product.</li>
      <li>, I am a satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and they love the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I make sure to apply plenty of organic moisturizer after application to prevent any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this peel.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;***I noticed the oil  was better on my skin and leaving it more hydrated.</li>
      <li>have not received the effect I was looking for, but I guess is okay</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle peel, but in my experience, it has improved my skin for the better.</li>
      <li>I can use this one more often without having to baby my skin afterwards.  </li>
      <li>Gentle and amazingly effective!</li>
      <li>This was definitely the perfect choice as it was very gentle, but still effective.  </li>
      <li>This peel feels great and is not harsh in any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, really tightens up the skin.</li>
      <li>my face  has a more clean appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
      <li>I just found the item on Amazon and was so thankful that I could easily order the Peel.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not that strong.</li>
      <li>After I finish this bottle (which is still 3/4 full), I will probably get the Level 2 peel :)</li>
      <li>Just make sure to use a good oil free moisturizer after because it definitely stripped my skin.</li>
      <li>is a good product but you need to follow the instruction clearly and keep skin hydrated a lot.</li>
      <li>a side note, make sure to follow the directions exactly as described on the product insert.  </li>
      <li>so I decided to try this product based on the many positive user reviews on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling super soft and looking like it has a nice glow.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it tingles a bit during the time it&#x27;s on your skin and while you are washing it off, but it quickly goes away.</li>
      <li>This peel is amazing for several reasons: 1) it did not exacerbate my eczema;</li>
      <li>It defiantly feels like its doing something when its on my skin; it burns quite a bit, but I have never actually &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; or saw noticeable results of any kind.</li>
      <li>2) for the most part, my eczema spots have cleared up since I&#x27;ve started using it; 3) the tone and texture of my skin is much improved; and 4) the price is extremely reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend scrubbing down your skin first with warm water and a wash cloth to prepare the skin for penetration, otherwise the thickness of the peel feels like it&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin.  </li>
      <li>But then the top layer of skin sloughs off from the peel on about the 3rd day, and new skin comes through, and you see significant results.  </li>
      <li>After the first use my skin felt tighter and smoother.  </li>
      <li>I love this skin peel - it&#x27;s my first ever, but will not be my last!</li>
      <li>However, since this was the first time I was going to use a peel, I didn&#x27;t want my experiment to start at a price of $60</li>
      <li>I decided on this pineapple-pumpkin peel for a first experience.  </li>
      <li>Fine lines have fainted and overall</li>
      <li>The only thing I noticed that I didn&#x27;t necessarily like was that my skin was much more shiny and anything I put on my face afterwards, got quickly absorbed (moisturizer/foundation etc.)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using about every 1-2 weeks and my face looks much clearer and brighter.</li>
      <li>You need to build up how much time you can keep it on.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>If anything, I know it feels much softer and smoother.  </li>
      <li>i did like it is gentle on my skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for a month now and don&#x27;t really see any changes at all in my skin.  </li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t rush nature in this situation.  </li>
      <li>think the most important things I can say about this is read the directions carefully, don&#x27;t leave it on too long, and MOISTURIZE afterwards.  </li>
      <li>am in my early 40&#x27;s with some early signs of aging, fine lines under the eyes and some deeper ones on the forehead, and some old acne scars here and there.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s working on a deeper level that I can&#x27;t see, but I was expecting a little more out of the product based on the reviews.</li>
      <li>my face  with a normal  liquid soap, rinse properly&lt;</li>
      <li>I have tired neck skin at the age of 50, so I thought a good peel might help.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample and ran out the other day.</li>
      <li>but I have just recently started getting a few compliments on how nice my skin looks.  </li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and even water can aggravate it</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>After the first use my skin was instantly brighter and tighter.</li>
      <li>and it did irritate that area and leave it red and burned looking for a few days, so that is why it is very important to follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used it 3 times so far and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything to help any of my problems.  </li>
      <li>I use this product professionally.  </li>
      <li>It also cleared up some adult acne I have been struggling with.</li>
      <li>I do at least one more application as directed, and wait for the tingle.  </li>
      <li>I am 61 years old.  </li>
      <li>Seemed to brighten skin at first, now my mature skin feels dry.</li>
      <li>If anything, it looks like my skin is even more tired and wrinkled than normal.  </li>
      <li>Perks your skin right up without any need for down time.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;ve really scrubbed my skin down first, I definitely feel that tingle-sting on the 2nd application.  </li>
      <li>And obviously its going to have some natural smell to it.</li>
      <li>In the beginning i noticed a higher activity on my forehead but in time  it went down.</li>
      <li>It leaves the skin slightly glowing/slick for about 24-48 hours, so if you&#x27;re a guy purchasing this, you might want to be aware of that.  </li>
      <li>This product is very easy to use and I hardly noticed any stinging-more of a little tingling.</li>
      <li>It is a viscuous, thick liquid which goes pretty far on application.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  used it one month once per week and I could see results:  my face  has a more clean appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I  have a mixed face  oily nose and chin  with a lot of black spots and occasionally  breakouts on the  forehead. In the beginning i noticed a higher activity on my forehead but in time  it went down. Just make sure you don&#x27;t touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My  routine was like this:&lt;br /&gt;wash my face  with a normal  liquid soap, rinse properly&lt;br /&gt;apply peeling for 1 minute, rinse  properly with cold water,  you might feel you  skin tight afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;apply  hydrating  cream or jojoba oil ( not both)&lt;br /&gt;***I noticed the oil  was better on my skin and leaving it more hydrated.</li>
    <li> Very good light peel, nice smell!</li>
    <li> Have only tried it once.</li>
    <li> I have tired neck skin at the age of 50, so I thought a good peel might help. I decided on this pineapple-pumpkin peel for a first experience.  It is a viscuous, thick liquid which goes pretty far on application.  I highly recommend scrubbing down your skin first with warm water and a wash cloth to prepare the skin for penetration, otherwise the thickness of the peel feels like it&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin.  You know your skin is receptive when you start to feel the tingle.  I have found that over the months of usage I have become more tolerant to the tingle, and if I don&#x27;t feel it I do at least one more application as directed, and wait for the tingle.  In fact, a bit of a sting is what I want as evidence of good penetration.  If I&#x27;ve really scrubbed my skin down first, I definitely feel that tingle-sting on the 2nd application.  The first few days after the peel are a bit disappointing.  If anything, it looks like my skin is even more tired and wrinkled than normal.  But then the top layer of skin sloughs off from the peel on about the 3rd day, and new skin comes through, and you see significant results.  Just hang in there for those transition days after the peel.  For me, it&#x27;s not an immediate effect.  The skin has to react to the acid and molt off. You really can&#x27;t rush nature in this situation.  But the result does finally come through and it lasts a few weeks.</li>
    <li> is a good product but you need to follow the instruction clearly and keep skin hydrated a lot. good product</li>
    <li> have not received the effect I was looking for, but I guess is okay</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, really tightens up the skin. Does it cause skin to peel? Not really. Need stronger&lt;br /&gt;TCA&#x27;s or Glycolics to do that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I received a free sample and ran out the other day. I just found the item on Amazon and was so thankful that I could easily order the Peel.  After the first use my skin felt tighter and smoother.  I would totally recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I use this product professionally.  It works well on all of my clients skin and they love the smell of it. Great results!</li>
    <li> i did like it is gentle on my skin</li>
    <li> Stung my face HORRIBLY yet didn&#x27;t produce any visible skin &amp;#34;turnover&amp;#34;.  Bought the same brand TCA 15% peel and I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love this peel! Makes my face look and feel so bright and refreshed! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and in good condition.  I love this peel.  Perks your skin right up without any need for down time.</li>
    <li> This peel feels great and is not harsh in any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this peel about once a week.  For application, I pour a little of the peel into a glass bowl and use an acid peel applicator brush to brush onto my face.  I leave it on for approximately 5 minutes then apply a second layer.  After another 5 minutes, I remove the mask by washing with cold water for ~ 2 minutes and I&#x27;m good to go.  Your face may be red after the application but give it a little bit of time and the redness should disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely recommended that you moisturize after the peel as well since it can be slightly drying.</li>
    <li> Excellent results. I&#x27;m a first time user of peels and I was a little afraid of doing it at home. This product is very easy to use and I hardly noticed any stinging-more of a little tingling. I&#x27;ve been using about every 1-2 weeks and my face looks much clearer and brighter.</li>
    <li> A good beginner peel. My face feels smoother. I will look forward to trying a Level 2 product. I am happy with the customer service. My questions were answered promptly.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this produce as part of your maintenance facial routine.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see results but I only used it once and I do microdermabrasion weekly so maybe there just wasn&#x27;t anything to exfoliate</li>
    <li> this product is good for your skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times, but have not seen any dramatic results, granted I have not used it religiously every week. It defiantly feels like its doing something when its on my skin; it burns quite a bit, but I have never actually &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; or saw noticeable results of any kind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a month now and don&#x27;t really see any changes at all in my skin.  Maybe it&#x27;s working on a deeper level that I can&#x27;t see, but I was expecting a little more out of the product based on the reviews.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a chemical peel for my face that was very light and could be used weekly without causing peeling.  This was definitely the perfect choice as it was very gentle, but still effective.  It leaves the skin slightly glowing/slick for about 24-48 hours, so if you&#x27;re a guy purchasing this, you might want to be aware of that.  Overall this is a great product by a great company and I will purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Have used the Salicylic peels from Perfect Image before, and I like that I can use this one more often without having to baby my skin afterwards.  Does make my skin softer and clearer with less redness, but less of a dramatic effect than stronger peels.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. After the first use my skin was instantly brighter and tighter. Just make sure to use a good oil free moisturizer after because it definitely stripped my skin. It also cleared up some adult acne I have been struggling with. My only complaint is I think it smells bad. Not like perfume, like overripe fruit. But it&#x27;s only a few minutes and it&#x27;s not that strong. And obviously its going to have some natural smell to it.</li>
    <li> I just start using it and I can see already a difference in my face. Money well spend</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, she loves it and says it&#x27;s a serious peel. You need to build up how much time you can keep it on.&lt;br /&gt;You can see an immediate result as well as after a few days. Some peeling might occur in between depending on how long you kept it for.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you need a facial before an event -keep it for a bit and it will illuminate your skin. If you want some deeper peeling, keep it for longer and get the results in a few days with some minor peeling in between.</li>
    <li> This has been a wonderful find!  I bought this product because I noticed that my skin tone was dull and the texture uneven.  I had read somewhere that the best enzyme peel for people with sensitive skin - that&#x27;s me! - is one that includes papaya extract.  I also suffer, on occasion, from breakouts of small patches of eczema on my face.  This peel is amazing for several reasons: 1) it did not exacerbate my eczema; 2) for the most part, my eczema spots have cleared up since I&#x27;ve started using it; 3) the tone and texture of my skin is much improved; and 4) the price is extremely reasonable.  I buy almost all of my facial care from Sephora. However, since this was the first time I was going to use a peel, I didn&#x27;t want my experiment to start at a price of $60 (Perfect Image&#x27;s peel was about $30 at the time of purchase) so I decided to try this product based on the many positive user reviews on Amazon.  Suffice to say, I am a satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, make sure to follow the directions exactly as described on the product insert.  I did the patch test twice to make sure my skin could tolerate this product.</li>
    <li> Works really nicely, but you have to read the instructions and use as directed!!  I wonder if people who leave bad reviews aren&#x27;t doing that.  It leaves my skin feeling super soft and looking like it has a nice glow.  I made the mistake of leaving it on too long once under my eye and it did irritate that area and leave it red and burned looking for a few days, so that is why it is very important to follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40&#x27;s with some early signs of aging, fine lines under the eyes and some deeper ones on the forehead, and some old acne scars here and there.  I bought this hoping it would help reduce some of those.  I&#x27;ve been using it 1-2 times per week now for about three weeks.  I can&#x27;t tell on myself if it has done anything (I forgot to take &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures) but I have just recently started getting a few compliments on how nice my skin looks.  If anything, I know it feels much softer and smoother.  I will keep using it if only for how it feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the most important things I can say about this is read the directions carefully, don&#x27;t leave it on too long, and MOISTURIZE afterwards.  And wear sunscreen!  And you have to give it time - one use will not change your face but continued use will give you results.</li>
    <li> I am 61 years old.  I have never had dry skin but it is now very dry and my face is all bumpy and of course I have age marks on my face.  I thought I would try this to see if it would help my age spots and remove some of the dry skin on my face.  I have used it 3 times so far and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything to help any of my problems.  I use the Hydrating Rose Glow cleanser to wash my face with every night then put Refresh moisturizer on my face and nothing seems to be helping.  I anyone knows what I can try to help my dryness please reply to this review.  I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Seemed to brighten skin at first, now my mature skin feels dry.</li>
    <li> Gentle and amazingly effective!</li>
    <li> I used this all summer long and this did not do a thing for my face! Another product I wasted money on.</li>
    <li> I love this skin peel - it&#x27;s my first ever, but will not be my last! I have VERY sensitive skin and even water can aggravate it but this skin peel did not. There were very little redness and blotchi-ness. Yes, it tingles a bit during the time it&#x27;s on your skin and while you are washing it off, but it quickly goes away. There wasn&#x27;t any burning or breakouts of any kind. The only thing I noticed that I didn&#x27;t necessarily like was that my skin was much more shiny and anything I put on my face afterwards, got quickly absorbed (moisturizer/foundation etc.) I make sure to apply plenty of organic moisturizer after application to prevent any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it about 4-5 times now (once a week) and have noticed firmer skin and reduced pores. Fine lines have fainted and overall the texture is better. It&#x27;s not a miracle peel, but in my experience, it has improved my skin for the better. After I finish this bottle (which is still 3/4 full), I will probably get the Level 2 peel :)</li>
    <li> I have used the pumpkin peel and it has proved to be very effective.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t  know what to say..... I was doubting, I was soooooooooo wrong. Amazing feeling skin. Perfect in its description. Grab it, try it......u will love it!!!!!!</li>
