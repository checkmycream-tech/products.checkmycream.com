      <li>This product does a wonderful job at leaving my hair clean and oilly build up does not happen as quickly.  </li>
      <li>I bought this Rusk Clarifying Shampoo based on the good reviews here, and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>it smells minty :)  </li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and the way my hair looks and feels after.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s looks better than ever.</li>
      <li>Really love this product.</li>
      <li>Leaves head nice and clean..</li>
      <li>It lightly lathers once on the hair, which releases a lovely scent.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and how clean my hair feels after.</li>
      <li>Rusk has left my hair incredibly silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Good product, however it is now more diluted than the original product was, so doesn&#x27;t go as far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Amazon needs to establish a system for verifying that their product descriptions are accurate.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this if it were accurately described and am now returning it.</li>
      <li>Great $$ for a giant bottle !</li>
      <li>Overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Works well and smells fabulous.  </li>
      <li>So basicly my hair is not in great condition.  </li>
      <li>I think it does help remove old product from your hair, but it does not make good suds for washing.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel as clean or healthy like the first time.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean and residue-free.</li>
      <li>I probably use it every other day now, with great results.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly for me though when used only for periodic deep cleaning.</li>
      <li>It worked really great the first time I used it but for some reason not so much the last two times.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight below-shoulder-length hair.</li>
      <li>This large bottle is a good deal for the price and it will last me for months.</li>
      <li>It effectively cleans my scalp without striping my hair entirely.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a huge heavy bottle that won&#x27;t fit in your shower caddy, and I sure wouldn&#x27;t want to drop it on my foot in the shower.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this after my Pureology - which I love - left my hair needing a boost.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only been a week, but I love the way my hair feels.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really blame the Pureology as I think that any shampoo, used consistently and without variation, leaves your hair needing some variety/a kick</li>
      <li>I really like the smell...</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Shipping could&#x27;ve been a little better as there was shampoo all over the baggie covering it.</li>
      <li>We have well water and using the normal shampoo for both didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those people that has a lot of long, fine hair, so build up can really make my hair look gross.  </li>
      <li>The first time, I used the same amount as my old shampoo, and I had bubbles everywhere.</li>
      <li>Although this shampoo is clarifying it still makes my hair feel soft.</li>
      <li>Lately it has become more oilly.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo smells good and also get rid of anything the well water left behind.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product and have used half of the bottle so far without disappointment.  </li>
      <li>I only need to use a little and shampoo once as it lathers well and is easy to distribute through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair if thin and fine,</li>
      <li>I have thin fine hair that I home color on a regular basis...  </li>

    <li> Works great - not my favorite smell, but OK</li>
    <li> Excellent  clarifying shampoo. Does the job. Will purchase agin.</li>
    <li> Leaves head nice and clean..&lt;br /&gt;Grows faster .  With nice shine...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that has a lot of long, fine hair, so build up can really make my hair look gross.  I was looking for a shampoo to use once or twice a week to remove build up and this has been great.  I love the way it smells and the way my hair looks and feels after.  I&#x27;m allergic to some perfumes, but this hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Like water, it&#x27;s so thin.  Smells good, but I have to wash my hair after using this as a clarifier</li>
    <li> Not happy with this shampoo. Gives me dry flyaway hair. I realize it is a clarified shampoo, but it strips.&lt;br /&gt;Also Rusk was vegan but not anymore. Will not be buying anymore Rusk products.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 9 months ago and began taking hormone replacements that made my hair dry and brittle. After searching for months for a product that would help me, I was told about Rusk Clarify Shampoo. It helps to strip residue and medication that accumulates in your hair. This is truly a great product!</li>
    <li> Works just like described.  Am very pleased with this product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair that I home color on a regular basis...  So basicly my hair is not in great condition.  Typically it has been dry and brittle.  Lately it has become more oilly.  This product does a wonderful job at leaving my hair clean and oilly build up does not happen as quickly.  I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> The amount of product in this bottle make this shampoo a excellent value.  It effectively cleans my scalp without striping my hair entirely.  It lightly lathers once on the hair, which releases a lovely scent.  I am very happy with this product and have used half of the bottle so far without disappointment.  I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight below-shoulder-length hair. I regularly use a moisturizing shampoo along with daily styling products. Over time, my hair feels a bit limp and heavy. I bought this Rusk Clarifying Shampoo based on the good reviews here, and I&#x27;m not disappointed. I use it once a week along with my regular conditioner (Loma Daily Conditioner). My hair feels clean and residue-free. When I ran out of my regular shampoo, I used the Rusk about four times in a row, and it was a bit drying. It works perfectly for me though when used only for periodic deep cleaning. I only need to use a little and shampoo once as it lathers well and is easy to distribute through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a huge heavy bottle that won&#x27;t fit in your shower caddy, and I sure wouldn&#x27;t want to drop it on my foot in the shower. I transfer it to a smaller bottle. Alternatively, you could add a pump. The scent is kind of a rosemary-menthol... It reminds me a bit of men&#x27;s shaving cream. It&#x27;s pleasant in the shower but doesn&#x27;t linger on your hair. This large bottle is a good deal for the price and it will last me for months.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered in time. It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> It worked really great the first time I used it but for some reason not so much the last two times. Doesn&#x27;t feel as clean or healthy like the first time. Am I doing something wrong I wonder?</li>
    <li> This shampoo was supposed to be sulfate-free. The second ingredient is sodium lauryl sulfate and the fourth is TEA-lauryl sulfate. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this if it were accurately described and am now returning it. Amazon needs to establish a system for verifying that their product descriptions are accurate.</li>
    <li> Although this shampoo is clarifying it still makes my hair feel soft. Works well and smells fabulous.  Really love this product.</li>
    <li> I just finished taking several medications and my hair seemed an off color. My hairdresser recommended a clarifying shampoo. After reading the reviews, I ordered the Rusk. It&#x27;s only been a week, but I love the way my hair feels. My hair if thin and fine, but it&#x27;s looks better than ever. I&#x27;m very pleased and highly recommend this shampoo. By the way, it takes just a bit. The first time, I used the same amount as my old shampoo, and I had bubbles everywhere.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and loved finding it in this size.  Shipping could&#x27;ve been a little better as there was shampoo all over the baggie covering it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for YEARS! I love it! I have thick curly hair- this helps detangle it in the shower, get rid of the product that&#x27;s built up in my hair and cuts grease!</li>
    <li> Use weekly for removing hair product buildup. Great $$ for a giant bottle !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything!! And I purchased a trial size of this shampoo and I&#x27;m regained hope in my hair&#x27;s health and appearance! HIGHLY recommend this product. My hair look and feels healthier than it ever has!!</li>
    <li> Good product, however it is now more diluted than the original product was, so doesn&#x27;t go as far.</li>
    <li> I needed a shampoo for my second wash each time I washed my hair.  We have well water and using the normal shampoo for both didn&#x27;t work.  This shampoo smells good and also get rid of anything the well water left behind.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I swim three times per week with my kids.  The price was very reasonable.  I really like the smell...it smells minty :)  I do find that it doesn&#x27;t lather well and it takes a lot of shampoo in order to get a substantial lather.  I have found that it does take care of the cholorine smell.  I usually follow up with my regular sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner for moisture, as I feel like this shampoo on it&#x27;s isn&#x27;t very moisturizing.  Overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my Pureology - which I love - left my hair needing a boost. I don&#x27;t really blame the Pureology as I think that any shampoo, used consistently and without variation, leaves your hair needing some variety/a kick start.&lt;br /&gt;The Rusk has left my hair incredibly silky and smooth. It&#x27;s the perfect compliment to a great conditioner like Pureology. I probably use it every other day now, with great results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month now. I love the smell and how clean my hair feels after.</li>
    <li> great smell and it makes my hair so SHINY</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning solutions and excess products out of your hair for a clean start.  I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> I think it does help remove old product from your hair, but it does not make good suds for washing. A little unsatisfying as a shampoo. I think of it as a means to an end.</li>
