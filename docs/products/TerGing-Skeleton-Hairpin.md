<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheap, free shipping, fast delivery and as cool as what you get from the picture! what can you have more of these cool goods!</li>
    <li> They are actually both right hands, not one right and one left.  Still, they&#x27;re very cute (and  surprisingly sturdy).  I&#x27;m quite happy with the clips themselves; many clips tend to fall out of my hair, but these are excellent and stay put.</li>
    <li> I bought these years ago, and paid four times the price then...the picture shows a set of two, i only received one little bone clippy. I e-mailed the seller when i was reviewing my purchases in 2015. The seller was friendly and offered a refund or send me the second clip. I opted for the clip I needed, to my surprise I received two! I wear them almost daily in October for the past years, the one clip I had has sustained the paint, and it hasn&#x27;t broken even when I have a beach pail of hair accessories that has fallen from the top of my dresser; for the people who said they break easily. I&#x27;m highly impressed with the seller, even if my hair is too thick and they tend to slide off after a few hours, I get TONS OF COMPLIMENTS! I can compromise; buy them!</li>
    <li> The clips came in pretty quick except they are very fragile and a few of the fingers had broken off in the delivery process, nothing a little glue couldn&#x27;t fix. Also the actual clip part themselves were broken also and poorly put together and I kind of ended up fixing them anyway. But besides that, they weren&#x27;t bad for their price and look cute too, so overall, they were okay.</li>
    <li> Very well made, super glued on, but still very secure. Got in both black with white and white with black.</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t broken thank goodness! Kinda weird I got two right hands. I&#x27;ll make it work. Probably going to get a Sharpie and darken the creases. They&#x27;re cute and worth the price. Shipping was fast(:</li>
    <li> Poorly painted and it came with to left hands</li>
    <li> Love it!! Took a while to arrive, but these are worth it. They are very cute. They are about 3 inches long and are made very well. The clip is a &amp;#34;duckbill clip&amp;#34; and it won&#x27;t snag on your hair.</li>
    <li> Wow, I mean wow dis is gr8 I love it. So much bettta than i thought tbh and they are perf. K</li>
    <li> Its a plastic skeleton hand, what could be wrong? really strong , sharp metal clips good for putting on anything, wont fall off! worth the pennies they cost.</li>
    <li> i love these! they look really nice and i&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on them. as the other comments say though, this is the same hand doubled, so if you&#x27;re looking for one of each?? maybe this isn&#x27;t for you. getting two is so nice!!!</li>
    <li> the hands are both right for me i was hoping for a left and right but oh wel its cute</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well made and adorable</li>
    <li> my teenage daughter wanted these things. she likes them. they seem to be of a reasonable quality. I do not think they&#x27;ll become heirlooms. price was okay</li>
    <li> First off these little guys are the cutest hair clips and much more unique than the typical flowers and bows. They arrived much faster than I thought they would (coming from china) so that was a nice surprise. The only reason I gave them a four out of five stars is because they are just slightly bigger than I wanted them to be. But other than that I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> When I ordered these I was expecting to get a left and a right hand... but instead got two left hands... rather frustrating for Mr considering I have ocd. Other than that they&#x27;re made pretty sturdy and make a cute little accesory</li>
    <li> I love these, they are just so adorable. Everyone compliments me on them. They match with almost everything and show up well in my dark hair.</li>
    <li> This item came early. I did get two right hands but its not really an issue, you just clip it upside down and no one can tell. It is sturdy and not as cheap as I thought it would be. Lovely item.</li>
    <li> Im still waiting. i purchased these over a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure why?&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping that if i purchased these over a month ago that&lt;br /&gt;i would have been able to have them by halloween! Dosnt look like it!</li>
    <li> So even though I received two right hands, not a right and left as pictured, I&#x27;m not going to deduct a star because I really like them. They hold my thin hair very well and don&#x27;t get tangled in it when I&#x27;m removing them. They are a nice size and seem well made, haven&#x27;t had to worry about them breaking yet.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, recipient loves it fun to wear</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly and they look exactly like the picture. The alligator clips are a little small and difficult to put on though. They&#x27;re different and I really like them!</li>
    <li> Pros: looks just as pictured. Absolutely adorable and the way the hands are curved, it looks like the hand is actually holding your hair back :P&lt;br /&gt;Cons: came with two left hands, can be tricky to put in as the fingers can get caught in your hair&lt;br /&gt;Overall: SO WORTH THE PRICE. Be careful with them, as all long plastic parts on anything can easily break. Don&#x27;t smush em and I&#x27;m sure all will remain in good condition.For kicks, I&#x27;m gonna apply some red paint splotches to make it look bloody.&lt;br /&gt;Stay spoopy kids c:</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cute, but with the way they&#x27;re curved, somewhat hard to put in.</li>
    <li> These are so cute!!! They are pretty thin so if you step on them they would probably snap... but.... thats your fault xD These are so cute and inexpensive and just perfect.</li>
    <li> A simple and cute clip for the cute / &#x27;goth&#x27; / &#x27;emo&#x27; / &#x27;scene&#x27; / &#x27;pastel goth&#x27; / etc.image, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments from strangers where I work c:  A bit bigger than what I expected (size of my pointer finger / 2 inches ) , but it&#x27;s not a tragedy and doesn&#x27;t stop me from wearing them almost every day c:</li>
    <li> I love them I use them almost every single day. However they can be frigile and brake easy. Arived in perfect condition and quick.</li>
    <li> These are super cute! They aren&#x27;t too small or too big! They look great with my pastel wig and my regular hair! They seem to be put together somewhat well. If the clips ever fall off I can just superglue them back on. They stay in my hair surprisingly well for how small they are (my hair is really thick) They don&#x27;t slip around and stay in place! The only downside was that I got two right hands. but it is okay. It is not something that I think should deduct a star. Overall, these are really great and super cute!! I will wear them as much as possible!</li>
    <li> Perfect size. Really strong hold. absolutely adorable! When I put one in, the little fingers look like they&#x27;re pushing back my hair.  So glad I got two for such an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I love these clips! They&#x27;re adorable and for me came fully intact no broken fingers or anything! I did in fact get two left hands but I really don&#x27;t care about that! And the best part is I got the catching necklace today as well and the set looks so lovely. I am very pleased with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> I really loved it! It is really cute and well made. It also arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> high quality for a low price. I&#x27;m buying more</li>
    <li> Got as a gift , and blew them away! Love the details! Just wish it came package safer but other then that it was great</li>
    <li> It took about 4 weeks to arrive and I&#x27;m glad I waited. The hands feel pretty nice and sturdy but the clips are so small. I&#x27;m assuming that they are just for looks or else they must be made for really thin hair because they wont really hold a lot of hair. Other then that they are perfect for cosplay or just that little cute creepy look cx</li>
    <li> I ordered one in white and one in black and they&#x27;re both good quality. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> Plastic-y, but not too small, and they hold up quite nicely. Overall worth the price</li>
    <li> Look just as they do in the picture, they clip in well &amp; stay in. Amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> These look awesome in!  The clips don&#x27;t hold a ton of hair, so I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s better to use them as a decorative element than an actual hair clip.</li>
    <li> bigger than i thought nicely made</li>
    <li> Very cute but broke the first week</li>
    <li> I ordered these clips a while back and two months after ordering them I hadn&#x27;t received them, so I emailed the seller and asked them if I should expect to ever get them. They immediately responded and were very kind and understanding and offered to send out replacements asap. Three days later I got them in the mail and they&#x27;re fantastic! They&#x27;re very sturdy and can hold a lot of hair. They&#x27;re painted very nicely and are super cute!! I love them so much and would definitely recommend them</li>
    <li> When these came in the mail I was quite excited...until I opened the package....The product itself seemed sloppy....meaning the paint job on it was very messy and the pinky finger looked warped...But otherwise I was quite satisfied with the product (considering the price)</li>
    <li> Clips are way too small for hair, they fall off every 30 minutes. You get what you paid for r</li>
    <li> These clips are super cute and comfortable.  They are sturdy, stay in the hair well, and look good in several positions in the hair or clipped to a lapel.  Glad I bought them and have got a few compliments on them.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re alright I guess, they do look like the picture except the shipped me two left hands instead of one left and one right, but that is kinda a nit picky complaint. The clip part doesn&#x27;t really hold very well and it&#x27;s really bulky, but they would be cool to add to updos or something (unfortunately I have a pixie cut so no chance there.) They are fun to clip on other things like my bag, or my shoes. The clip holds for stuff like that. it just doesn&#x27;t stick in my hair very well because the metal is really smooth.</li>
    <li> glue on 1 clip gave out before 1st use</li>
    <li> These are great&lt;br /&gt;I just give 4 out of 5 stars because of the way one of my clips was glued&lt;br /&gt;It was really hard to put on since it was glued a bit wrong but is a great product anyways</li>
    <li> Cute and cheap, however the glue holding the clip to the hand is weak and came apart, I used gorilla glue to put it back on and its holding</li>
    <li> These Skeleton Hand Hair Clips are awesome.</li>
    <li> I love these barrettes. It did make me giggle that I got two right hands, but hey, makes it more unique. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Recieved two right hands which sucks, but they are still cute nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Same hand, poor quality</li>
    <li> One of the hair clips was broken which was disappointing but the other was fine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love ! I have a unique fashion sense and I so will rock these in school 😁😍</li>
    <li> Cheap, but super cute and work if you handle with care :)</li>
    <li> I love these clips. The shipping was on schedule and when they got here, they were in good shape. No problems and sit in my hair well. These are the cutest clips ever.</li>
    <li> The clips arrived on time or even earlier but one of the clips were damaged when I opened it :( but a little superglue fixed that up!</li>
    <li> The quality of these for the price is very surprising! They look and work extremely well, and I hope to collect all the colors! It&#x27;s much more productive to buy these here than to waste $10.00 on a pair at a store like Hot Topic.</li>
    <li> is ok, poorly made, had to glue one when i first got it</li>
    <li> I LOVE these. I wear them all the time. I found the same ones at icings in the mall but they were like, $8 more. So this is a sweet deal!!</li>
    <li> These things are super cute! They stay in my hair very well. I worried about them being small but they&#x27;re a good size.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cute, I just wish it were two different hands instead of two of the same ones.</li>
    <li> so i ordered and they came in like a week and a half, not too bad since i live in california. but the clip on the right hand was broken. :((( i just fixed it with a hot glue gun but i was really bummed that they sent me  broken one.</li>
    <li> I love them they look like the picture and r very well made but sadly I got two right hand (lol) but that didn&#x27;t stop me of wearing them I love them and I&#x27;m really glad about my purchase I will defently buy from here again :) !!!</li>
    <li> very very cute! I kept one for myself and gave the other to my friend. Though the clip it&#x27;s self may be a bit short, the little fingers make up for it by pulling back access hair. This product is just really great.</li>
    <li> I ordered these before, but they never came. I ordered a second pair and they got here quick and look just like the picture. They stay in place all day. Would have given it 5 stars if the first pair actuay arrived (but at the time they were only a couple dollars so it wasn&#x27;t a big loss)</li>
    <li> One of them came without the clip ,and the other one broke easily</li>
    <li> I ordered these on Sept 12 got them on Oct 1 excellent shipping considering from China, neat pakaging. If I&#x27;m being nitpicky here I&#x27;d have to say I didn&#x27;t like how the hands were kinda clear translucent, are they glow in the dark? And how one was slightly larger than the other one. Clips otherwise holds on great it doesn&#x27;t seem to break off any time soon. Great quality overall for only around a buck or two.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Last time I tried to order these from a different seller they weren&#x27;t at all well made as these are much nicer looking and sturdier than others. Also when I ordered from other sellers I ha only received one which was much more poorly made as I mentioned so I&#x27;m extremely happy it&#x27;s these they&#x27;re cute and not at all expensive! The clips are pretty good too and I really love these clips they&#x27;re so cute C: picture shows one but I was wearing both of them and I really love them c:</li>
    <li> Love them!!&lt;br /&gt;The plastic seems hard enough, that if i was to drop them by mistake (butter fingers) they wouldn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;plus, i got a second pair, so i don&#x27;t know if i ordered 2 by accident or if they were being extra nice.</li>
    <li> cute clips! good qualitty</li>
