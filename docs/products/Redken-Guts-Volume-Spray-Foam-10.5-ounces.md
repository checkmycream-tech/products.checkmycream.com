    <li> Great product for short hair.  Very good price.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have short textured hair and this product is fabulous for volume! I put it on with damp hair and dry it. I don&#x27;t use any other product than this one. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Have tried many hair products and keep going back to this one...excellent product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using guts for years and will never be out of stock.  It leaves my blown-dry hair full and bouncy.  It also helps my brush glide through my hair while blow drying.  Word of warning, though:  This is NOT to be applied like a mousse.  It&#x27;s for ROOT application only. Section your hair and apply to the roots where you want fullness.  If you apply it through your hair, your hair may feel oily.</li>
    <li> Eh.  Works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but nothing great.  Glad I bought small size.</li>
    <li> Guts I all I use on my hair.  I like it just fine.  Gives my hair volume which I need.</li>
    <li> Use this almost every day.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will buy again from same seller.</li>
    <li> Great delivery!! Had tape over the top so it wouldn&#x27;t spray and had double packaging to protect can....and I got it right away!  Saved me a nightmare stop at Walmart over the holidays...</li>
    <li> Did not work well. Have used a Matrix product for years that is no longer being made., This was not nearly as good</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and I love it. Good hold, not heavy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I think they changed the formula when they changed the bottle. Still a good product but was better before.</li>
    <li> Great for the roots of fine fair. Gives me lots of body without being sticky.</li>
    <li> I love how easy this is to apply and helps maintain my style without frizz throughout the day.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer and it can get slightly clumpy.  However, a quick finger brush takes care of that and I&#x27;m back in business.</li>
    <li> Love love love guts 10.  Gives my short hair so much body and volume</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product. Works extrememly well.</li>
    <li> Really like this because it&#x27;s light weight but works for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Guts 10 for years.  They changed the can and my opinion is--the formula.  I could swear it&#x27;s not the same as my old Guts.</li>
    <li> This gives great volume with no stickiness.  My hair feels healthy and has a natural feel to it instead of some volume products that leave your hair too stiff and sticky.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Gives my hair the lift it needs!</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s root-directed, that is, not sprayed in the hand to rub over the hair.  It poofs up my thin hair nicely.</li>
    <li> Does not really help add volume toy roots in the way I thought it would.</li>
