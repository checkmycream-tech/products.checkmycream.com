      <li>I got my nails done and this product is what they used, I loved it so much that I had to get it for myself.</li>

      <li>and it is the best, the only body cream worth using.  </li>
      <li>I could not tolerate the strong perfume smell.</li>
      <li>I have been on the hunt for the perfect body butter for my boyfriend since a year and a half ago.</li>
      <li>However, the light orange color stained my clothes.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic lotion.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s so smooth on my skin</li>

      <li>Great for dry skin and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super rich and creamy, not greasy.</li>
      <li>Also, the smell is not as sweet as I thought it would be for a &amp;#34;milk and honey&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I ORDERED THE FULL SIZE AND USED IT ALL OVER BODY AFTER SHOWERING.  </li>
      <li>The butter is not bad, nice smell (despite I generally don&#x27;t like honey), but as for me - nothing special.</li>
      <li>Not greasy or liquid-y, but a true butter consistency that is easily absorbed with leaving a residue.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, it&#x27;s not 100% natural, but it has some really good ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and feels like a soft glove on hands.</li>
      <li>It is not sticky at all and absorbs right away.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin incredibly soft, is absorbed quickly without leaving you feeling sticky or greasy, and smells fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance is strong so if you are sensitive to this, it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
      <li>So if your skin isn&#x27;t super dry and you want something that&#x27;s a bit more hydrating during the winter then try this.</li>
      <li>The best part is a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I cannot relax or go to sleep without first rubbing this cream into my feet, there is nothing like it.  </li>
      <li>My feet are INSTANTLY soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Will most definitely order this product again.</li>
      <li>Item arrived just as described Packed very well.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Smells really good,too.</li>
      <li>Use this year-round on your whole body.</li>
      <li>My mother-in-law loves it much,it is very helpful to make skin touching smooth and delicate.</li>
      <li>Most regular lotions would keep his skin hydrate for only 10, 15 minutes if put on right after shower.</li>
      <li>I HAD TRIED A SMALL SAMPLE PACKET OF THIS TREATMENT ON MY HANDS AND REALLY LIKED IT.</li>
      <li>It is more moisturizing than regular lotions but only lasts for about 60 to 90 minutes on my boyfriend.</li>
      <li>High quality item, like it a lot</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the creamy texture and the fragrance.  The price is right and it really helps smooth your tired and rough skin.  Would definitely recommed to friends, and actually have.  Fragrance is strong so if you are sensitive to this, it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
    <li> I keep this on my bed table. I like to get in bed at night and put this on my hands and feet.</li>
    <li> Just want you to know that if you want soft skin then this is the product for you...  has a very soft smell and actually feels like butter when you put in on your skin.. I use it every day and now my boyfriend is using it too...Great product</li>
    <li> Cuccio makes excellent products, and this is my favorite flavor of body butter.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling very soft. However the scent is too strong for me and almost makes me nauseated.  If the company altered the scent and made it less strong then I would consider purchasing again. For now I&#x27;m left with an expensive jar of lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It really lasts a long time. Even my husband likes it and he isn&#x27;t one for lotions and potions.</li>
    <li> Love this hydrating treatment.  Not oily or greasy.  Goes on smooth and feels great.  Lasts for awhile, also.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best body creme I have ever tried.  It leaves your skin incredibly soft, is absorbed quickly without leaving you feeling sticky or greasy, and smells fresh and clean.  Once you try it you will be hooked.  The best part is a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic lotion. Rich and yummy smelling. Looking forward to trying other scents.</li>
    <li> This smells great and is so moisturizing.  It leaves my hands extra soft.</li>
    <li> This product is a very soft, smooth, great feeling lotion. The fragrance is wonderful! However, the light orange color stained my clothes.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this for her hands.  It is less than half the price that her manicurist charges for the exact same item.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel silky soft.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and it is magical how quickly it absorbs. It doesn&#x27;t leave even the slightest greasy residue. I keep a jar at home and one at the office.</li>
    <li> Been buying Cuccio naturale butter for a few years now. Great lotion! and I love to give it as gifts to people.&lt;br /&gt;It is always a hit. It comes in several different smells but this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> High quality item, like it a lot</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH THAT I PURCHASED MORE FOR ME AND FOR GIFTS; DOES A WONDERFUL JOB OF SMOOTHING YOUR SKIN; NON GREASY AND A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY;</li>
    <li> The nail salon I frequent uses this on my feet. I loved the smell and how it felt so much that I went on Amazon and purchased it. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> The lotion makes my skin so very soft. It has a VERY light scent that positively accompanies the softness of the lotion.</li>
    <li> I was afraid my relentless body odor would drive my girlfriend away, but after getting her this wonderful hand cream she hardly notices anymore</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizing product!</li>
    <li> I alsolutely love this hand and body cream, so when I was able to get it for such and incredible price to I was very happy. Very good service from the vendor too.</li>
    <li> This is terrific for hand and body. Goes on smoothly, not sticky or greasy. Leaves your hands baby soft. Smells wonderful not too overwhelming as to interfere with perfumes.</li>
    <li> The butter is not bad, nice smell (despite I generally don&#x27;t like honey), but as for me - nothing special. just one more body butter.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I expected. I have extremely dry hands and I always opt for creamy, rich moisturizers or butters. I applied a reasonable amount of this product to my hands and at first it absorbed into my skin but not even 5 minutes later, my hands were dry &amp; scaly again. It has a terrible &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; effect. Also, the smell is not as sweet as I thought it would be for a &amp;#34;milk and honey&amp;#34; fragrance. The remaining aroma was a bit funky. I&#x27;m very happy that I did Not purchase the full size because I would have been very upset with myself. The company needs to revise the formula so that it provides a fair amount moisture.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, fabulous fragrance, long lasting moisturizer. Use this year-round on your whole body. Never leaves cream on your clothes or sheets. Elbows are like a baby!</li>
    <li> I an shocked at how much I love this stuff! It&#x27;s super rich and creamy, not greasy. It smells like heaven. I&#x27;m going to buy the 32 oz size when I run out. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> smells okay and works good</li>
    <li> very light and smells great</li>
    <li> Best Hydrating Crème I have ever used !!!</li>
    <li> Great for elbows, heels, cuticles. Hands and feet have never been softer.&lt;br /&gt;It Smells really good,too. Are sample tubes available?</li>
    <li> Leaves my hands sooo soft. Great scent. Great price!</li>
    <li> absolutely love this!!!</li>
    <li> Love Cuccio Naturale Butter Blend in how it repairs skin without feeling greasy.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I HAD TRIED A SMALL SAMPLE PACKET OF THIS TREATMENT ON MY HANDS AND REALLY LIKED IT. I ORDERED THE FULL SIZE AND USED IT ALL OVER BODY AFTER SHOWERING.  THE BEST BODY BUTTER I HAVE EVER USED. WILL NEVER RUN OUT OF THIS!  MAKES YOUR BODY SO SO SOFT!</li>

    <li> Smells wonderful. Very smooth and feels like a soft glove on hands.</li>
    <li> This butter is BUTTER. Seriously, it&#x27;s not 100% natural, but it has some really good ingredients in it. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample and loved the Cuccio Naturale Butter Blend Treatment Milk and Honey.  Great for dry skin and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great for hands in winter!</li>
    <li> Item arrived just as described Packed very well. Happy.</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this product and I liked it so much that I ordered it.  It feels really nice as you massage it into your skin.  Not greasy or liquid-y, but a true butter consistency that is easily absorbed with leaving a residue.  Very pleasant fragrance also.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s so smooth on my skin and it last all day. It has a nice scent as well.</li>
    <li> I just tried this lotion few days ago . it&#x27;s so soft and not greasy at all. I decide to use it from now on.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is excellent. It melts into my skin without feeling greasy. I used it after showering daily. My skin is softer and firmer. I love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> What a great lotion. It goes on very smooth and hydrating and doesn&#x27;t make you feel sticky.  It smells great and lasts all day. What else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for the perfect body butter for my boyfriend since a year and a half ago. He has a condition called ichthyosis vulgaris, commonly known as fish scale skin, which leaves his skin super dry and scaly all the time, especially on his legs. I&#x27;ve tried over 30 different lotions, creams and body butters on him. Most regular lotions would keep his skin hydrate for only 10, 15 minutes if put on right after shower. Great body butters can last 3, 4 hours. Products with petroleum jelly of course can keep it hydrate for 5, 6 hours but we both hate how sticky it feels and how it just sits on top of his skin without actually absorbs in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body butter is very light. It is not sticky at all and absorbs right away.The scent is subtle enough that no one really notices it on him even standing two feet away.  It is more moisturizing than regular lotions but only lasts for about 60 to 90 minutes on my boyfriend. He&#x27;ll finish using it but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll purchase it again. Reapplying every hour is just a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I&#x27;ve tried using it myself (I have normal skin with no sensitivity) and it works great. The only thing is the scent contradicts with my perfume so I can&#x27;t keep using it. So if your skin isn&#x27;t super dry and you want something that&#x27;s a bit more hydrating during the winter then try this. It&#x27;s a great body butter, just not on someone with skin condition like my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> I could not tolerate the strong perfume smell.</li>
    <li> I got my nails done and this product is what they used, I loved it so much that I had to get it for myself. It&#x27;s so Hydrating and moisturizing. Will most definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The best!  I use it under my makeup everyday and have for years. Not greasy at all.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever. Keeps my skin hydrated better than any I have used before. Will keep using. Improves skin texture and adds a nice glow</li>
    <li> Love this cream and anyone I have given one as a gift loves it.</li>
    <li> love it. Smell delicious</li>
    <li> I have been using Cuccio Milk and Honey body cream for YEARS and it is the best, the only body cream worth using.  The scent is soft and strangely addictive, the texture is smooth, it sinks into the skin completely, and the moisturizing and smoothing properties of this cream are unparalleled.  I cannot relax or go to sleep without first rubbing this cream into my feet, there is nothing like it.  My feet are INSTANTLY soft and smooth.  This cream is without a doubt the ONE thing I would want on a deserted island!  This cream is my addiction!</li>
    <li> love the feel and aromal</li>
    <li> quick delivery and wonderful product</li>
