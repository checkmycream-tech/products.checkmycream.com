      <li>This is almost as good as a craniosacral massage but not quite.  </li>
      <li>Good headrest</li>
      <li>so I got a fairly good idea.  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>

      <li>so in love with this gadget!</li>
      <li>You will feel better after lying on the Still Point Inducer for 15 minutes!  </li>

      <li>I love my Still Point Inducer!</li>
      <li>He thought it was amazing..</li>
      <li>It is amazing how it gives relief of headaches without taking medication.  </li>
      <li>this thing is so amazing...</li>
      <li>and it was amazing</li>
      <li>i would have liked for it to have worked, but i didn&#x27;t get anything from using the head rester.</li>
      <li>but I still needed to do some preventive work on my own to help alleviate the tension in my neck.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it on amazon .I&#x27;ll</li>
      <li>I will have to research on my own.</li>
      <li>I think it would feel nice on the neck otherwise....</li>
      <li>Not as effective as giving yourself a \\&quot;trigger point\\&quot; head massage with your fingers.</li>
      <li>When I take my head off the inducer, I feel a warm rush...</li>
      <li>but I thought itt was nice to include it.</li>
      <li>(make sure you position it according to the instructions printed on the package in order to achieve optimum results).  </li>
      <li>I ordered it Sunday and it arrived Tuesday - nice.</li>
      <li>I have no idea if it actually is effective.</li>
      <li>The original was great and lasted for years.</li>
      <li>Shipping was normal and the product was in perfect condition but the box that the product comes in (not the shipping box) was smushed a bit.</li>
      <li>Super, helps great for mechanical migraine headaches.</li>
      <li>Very good substitute for real hands to relax you.  </li>
      <li>Size and composition are perfect and offers lots of relief.</li>
      <li>as advertised--Well packaged --Very quick shipment!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as comfortable as the &amp;#34;Soothe-A-Ciser&amp;#34; but it may actually do more good for my neck issues.</li>
      <li>Good points are that one person who tried it found it more comfortable</li>
      <li>This is the next best thing if you don&#x27;t have a craniosacral therapist handy.  </li>
      <li>This is the original product - as advertised and at an exceptional price.  </li>
      <li>and he claimed it was very comfortable as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would have been more helpful if there were a diagram as to where to place it, but the written instructions were very detailed....  </li>
      <li>This simple thing is one of the best things I&#x27;ve tried for neck pain.  </li>
      <li>She said that&#x27;s why most people have problems with it -</li>
      <li>I figured this device would be more stable and stay in place, but</li>
      <li>They treat my migraines better than medicine.</li>
      <li>I love ..</li>
      <li>Four more words required.</li>
      <li>I know there are some folks who love this product.</li>
      <li>It works better than tennis balls in a sock because it doesn&#x27;t roll around.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Make dire to order the harder still point as apposed to soft</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me to help with neck pain. So far I have used it twice as has my husband. Both of us feel a million times bertter. I love this thing!</li>
    <li> Using it under my ears on a flat surface really helped with my shoulder pain. I would not feel relief until the next day, but it was pretty significant.</li>
    <li> A little tricky to figure out at first.  Must place this in a very specific area behind the head to get the benefit.</li>
    <li> Have tried this device for a week and feel it has lived up to the manufacturers claims and my expectations!</li>
    <li> Still Point Inducer&lt;br /&gt;Several days ago, I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;ve had had enough as far as neck pain and shoulder discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;From pillows to orthopedic tools to neck collar I was decided to try everything.&lt;br /&gt;So I went crazy and I ordered several tools online and started trying them out as they&#x27;d arrive in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;This tool was the last one to arrive and maybe would&#x27;ve been the last one I would&#x27;ve chosen to try out.&lt;br /&gt;Lie down on the floor with your head on this thing for 20 minutes (make sure you position it according to the instructions printed on the package in order to achieve optimum results).  When you stand up you feel your muscles loosening up and the relief of the tension accumulated going away! Do this before you go to bed and you&#x27;ll wake up without headaches!&lt;br /&gt;So simple and yet so effective!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so in love with this gadget!</li>
    <li> I have been in chronic pain for going on 4 years, due to 5 disc herniations in my neck. I have repeatedly seen the SPI advertised in catalogs and online, and it always got my attention by the claims that sounded bogus. I am a chiropractic student and am well aware of how the cranio-sacral pump works, but never had it worked on. I had a friend apply pressure with his fingers on my still points, and it helped my pain greatly. I decided at that point that it was time to buy the thing. I got it in the mail, and immediately tried it because i was in pain. WOW! this thing is so amazing...it relaxes the cervical muscles so well. However, it is just a temporary fix, and doesn&#x27;t replace actually getting rid of the problem, something that chiropractic works wonders for, and so much more.</li>
    <li> Love this product keep ordering it over and over for different people I care about!&lt;br /&gt;work wonders for stress, migraines, sinuses and any pains off the spine</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel this product did anything when used as recommended.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It really helps relieve stress.  However, I am looking for the firm version of the product.  My masseuse has a firm version and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> use it regurlaly gives good support to occipital area and release of neck muscles</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about purchasing this for a headache remedy.  After my massage therapist recommended it, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It really works for me!  You have to make sure to place it in the recommended spot (lined up with the top of your ears) when you are lying down.  After 10-15 minutes, my headache is always gone.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my cranial-sacral practitioner and is a really helpful tool to preserving the progress made between treatments.  I notice a difference in my body after a few minutes.  Perhaps it would also give relief to people who have not had experience with cranial-sacral treatments.  It cost less through Amazon than other places.</li>
    <li> this product was a great purchase. I got one for myself and two others for friends, everyone is happy. I only wish I had invented it myself!!!</li>
    <li> Just used it for congestion and it really helped.  Also for relaxing - - find myself deep breathing while using it.</li>
    <li> Very pliable, expected it to be more rigid.</li>
    <li> I first saw this during a massage.  I inquired about it and realized that I had to get one for myself.  I use it quite often just to get on my back and let everything go.</li>
    <li> Fabulous to reduce stress and relieve headaches or migraines</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product. It&#x27;s wierd, but it seems to work,for whatever reason. The cost isn&#x27;t outrageous. Try it!</li>
    <li> Yes, it is an odd looking duck, but it actually worked for me when I was suffering a tension headache.  I placed it on the base of my head and the headache was gone in about 10 minutes.  I can&#x27;t give it a higher rating because I can&#x27;t speak to any of the other claims the inventor make.  All I can say it that it works beautifully on my tension headache in a very, very short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Find the CD really relaxing and probably would not go anywhere without my little red pillow!</li>
    <li> This thing felt so wierd at first, then everything starts to relax...I have cervical herniations and was soooo grateful to find some relief.</li>
    <li> I use this item as originally intended, and also use it to put between the small of my back and my office chair. The relief it brings cannot be overstated.</li>
    <li> Hard to understand where/how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely did not perform as I anticipated.</li>
    <li> This replaced one that wore out. The original was great and lasted for years. Unfortunately the replacement was much worse quality than the original one. I would not buy again. I did buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Still Point Inducers for years. I was disappointed when I received these. The quality is not as good as it once was. These are much softer than the original ones.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from a rare occurance of a headache and remembered my recent purchase of the still point inducer.  I used it for 4 minutes and had wonderful relief!  It looks inocuous, but headaches don&#x27;t stand a chance!</li>
    <li> Having headaches and cervical spine issues for years, my physical therapist recommended I pick one of these up for home use.  It&#x27;s great!  I lay down placing it right underneath the base of my skull and it puts pressure on the points that I can&#x27;t get to myself.  I would strongly suggest that anyone with chronic headaches or neck pain pick one up.</li>
    <li> I think this item is too soft to really have a beneficial effect. Two tennis balls in a tube sock work better...</li>
    <li> I love my still point inducer.  When I lay on it, I immediately \\&quot;trance out\\&quot; and achieve a very peaceful serene feeling that lasts all day.  It&#x27;s like a reset switch for your nervous system.</li>
    <li> It took me a week for my head to adjust to the Stillpoint. I have been using it daily for 10 minutes. I have noticed a reduction in my headaches but not in my neck or upper back pain. In all fairness I have a bone spurs in my neck and the Still Point Inducer may not help this condition. I will continue using it as I have hopes that in time I will notice less pain overall.</li>
    <li> I received product as ordered :)  Not much to go on to get started.  I have placed product as indicated but not sure of any benefit revealed.. surprised it is not indicated to place in occipital region....I will have to research on my own.</li>
    <li> I could have put 5 stars but since I just got it today and tried it right away, I think I should just give it 4 stars for now.  I&#x27;ll update positive or negative in the future as I plan to use it everyday or several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had pain in the back of my neck area for 20+ years - some call it a stress headache - but I just considered it pain that never goes away and my Ostepathic Doctor recommended Cranio-Sacral Technique with a Physical Therapyst.  Since I couldn&#x27;t find one that took insurance, I did an internet search for this technique to see what it was.... Also, another reviewer had said he looked at videos on Youtube.com.  I found two Youtube videos were on this product: Still Point Inducer... although couldn&#x27;t really see the placement well..... Then I watched several videos of Physical Therapists doing the technique so I got a fairly good idea.  It seems just like light massage under the skull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I first read up to page 5 of the reviews to get feedback and tips and plan to read the rest later.  I&#x27;m glad I did as I will explain one tip that really helped. ... Note:  I found the material this is made of just right.  It&#x27;s heavy/sturdy rubber, not slippery or squishy as some said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One helpful reviewer said she found a thin paperback book to place under this and it helped.... I wanted to use it on my bed - rather than floor.... First I tried a thin plastic cutting board, but that didn&#x27;t work at all as it tipped and slipped right off. ... Then I could feel that, after placing it under the skull as described in the written instructions, that it tipped towards my shoulders - which was not right. ... So I went and got a thin paperback book, as recommended, and covered it with a dishtowel so it wouldn&#x27;t slip..... I soon realized that I should only place the book under 1/2 of the device (the part closest to my shoulders) so it balanced and didn&#x27;t tip.... That worked perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been more helpful if there were a diagram as to where to place it, but the written instructions were very detailed....  It took a little experimenting for a few minutes, but I think I got it in the correct place.  (Not to put on neck, but to put on the bony part of the scull - which was counterintuitive to my pain area...  But I wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t do damage to the nerves in my neck.)  I noticed that one reviewer said she had optical problems on one eye after use so that made me more careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a relaxation CD that is made up a short introduction cut and 8 short different  relaxation sounds - totaling just over 20 minutes.  The cuts go from one into the other without a break which was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps, because I have fibromyalgia, I felt the device pressing into my skull a little painful... but no pain no gain sometimes.  So I relaxed into it for 20 minutes until the CD stopped.  (I&#x27;d be afraid to fall asleep on this and wouldn&#x27;t recommend that for anyone in case it slipped down to the neck.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sitting up, I felt a big rush of circulation going through the area that had been targeted - not really tingling.  It was a little scary but I expected it from the reviews.  It&#x27;s been about 15 minutes and I can still feel pressure in the area but I think it is helping.  I feel like holding my head up and shoulders back better.... so I have hopes that it will relieve pain.  Right now I feel the residual pressure rather than pain.... so that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if I have more info to add later.</li>
    <li> I got this product because of chronic migraines, neck/shoulder pain, muscle tightness, tmj... It just arrived today. I am very pleased with the result and I have only used it twice. It has the perfect level of firmness for me --I am 5&#x27;9\\&quot;, @170 lbs. Though I cannot speak to the long term effect, the immediate feeling after using the product is one of relaxation. It makes your whole body feel invigorated. I am crossing my fingers that there will be long term benefits as well :)</li>
    <li> Tried this product and found that it helps on occasion, however, it is uncomfortable to use for a long period of time.</li>
    <li> Its fabulous for tension headaches.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work for me. Unfortunately, the material is just too slippery.  My head slides off no matter what surface (floor, bed,) that I try to use it on.  Too bad, and back to using tennis balls that have been taped together. It may work for you, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a Neck King unit.  The Neck King (for me anyway) is perfect, but the Still Point Inducer unit has a couple of weak points.  It is not as stable and tends to move a bit under the suboccipital area.  That is a bit frustrating as you have to reposition it a lot.  It is softer (not squishy soft, but not hard)  and I don&#x27;t feel that it is putting enough pressure on the area compared to the Neck King.  Good points are that one person who tried it found it more comfortable, it is small enough to travel with, it is inexpensive.  Therefore, it&#x27;s just OK.  For my dollar the Neck King is better.</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist I have done some cranial / sacral therapy  so I&#x27;m familiar with the process and the points. I find that the base is a little narrow to be stable and tends to slide.  I  also have the &amp;#34;Craniocradle and find it more stable and more versatile.</li>
    <li> Very effective tool. Just seems to hard after a while. But overall great product. I would certainly share my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable tool one must add to their tools of healing!  Enhances the healing experience but it also a great stand alone tool.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> As a chronic neck pain sufferer I bought the still point inducer in hopes of finding something that would release the tension in my neck and help restore its natural posture.  Although the inducer didn&#x27;t help in that area, I was immediately impressed by its ability to reduce headaches and for an overall relaxing experience.  One kind of strange thing about the inducer - if you lay on it for a long period of time (&gt;30 min) you will experience scalp numbing.  Overall I would recommend this product as an alternative for headache relief.</li>
    <li> Good headrest, that&#x27;s about all. Note well this disclaimer from the seller: \\&quot;The Still Point Inducer is neither a medical device nor intended as treatment for medical conditions. This product does not cure medical ailments or illnesses.\\&quot; Does nothing more to relieve a headache than a firm pillow. Not as effective as giving yourself a \\&quot;trigger point\\&quot; head massage with your fingers.</li>
    <li> I ordered several neck stretching tools and this was one of the ones than went back. The foam was too soft to do anything useful.</li>
    <li> worthless... threw it away :(</li>
    <li> it really does work - the cd with a bit of music and hypnotism helps too. But it took away my headache caused by extreme muscle bunching in my neck with in a minute or two</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he said after almost a full min he could feel is nasal passage open up. We didn&#x27;t have any problems with it smashing or not working properly, the only reason for the 4 star is the price. I paid a little over $20 for it and I&#x27;m not sure that is such a good deal. Otherwise it seems to be helpful.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great to relieve pressure and helps with headaches</li>
    <li> This producted was recommended by  my massage therapist to help relieve tension. It works well but you have to consistently use it. But if you use it too much for too long, you will get a sore neck.</li>
    <li> I had an older one of these that I got from somewhere else, and this one was nowhere near as good.  the foam was stiffer and it slid all over the floor, it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Works great, just a little over priced.</li>
    <li> This Still Point Inducer causes the CNS to rest and &amp;#34;reboot,&amp;#34; if you will. It shift the central nervous system into &amp;#34;rest and digest&amp;#34; or the parasympathetic side and takes you out of &amp;#34;fight or flight&amp;#34; or the sympathetic side. This is greatly helpful to the organ systems which are more greatly fed by the blood supply with nutrients and oxygen in the parasympathetic state. It also helps release soft-tissue tension in the face, head, neck, shoulders, upper back, and if you use it a lot - the entire body. I use mine every day. It makes a huge difference in how I feel and function. I love my Still Point Inducer!</li>
    <li> i bought one of these 15 years ago and it is still in great shape especially considering how much i use it. NOTHING has given me the relief and the healing effects for my back. I start at my lower back and keep moving it up until i get to my neck. I stand up at work for hours,run after three kids and cook and clean,do yoga and walk . I have recommended this to all sorts of friends but didn&#x27;t know what it was called. (the boobie thing) I was thrilled to find it on amazon .I&#x27;ll order another one for the heck of it since mine is still good.</li>
    <li> This small product was recommended by a Cranio-Sacral Therapist to reduce stress in the neck, shoulders and jaw areas.  I very simply works very well.  It is dersigned to trigger a release of the muscle systems that hold the stress, and it does.</li>
    <li> just what i needed, thanks, smooth transaction, all went well, now my friends all want one, maybe i will order more,,</li>
    <li> Great product for tension headaches and sinus pressure relief. Works best on firm surface. On light colored linens a red mark was left behind, but washed out in the laundry.</li>
    <li> My massage therapist recommended I get one for neck pain.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks for 15 minutes right before I try to sleep at night.  I have never slept so well (even with medication) and my neck also feels a lot better.  I&#x27;ve also suggested it to friends who are also using it to help with sleep.  Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It comes with a music CD too!  I purchased this for a fraction of what my therapist was selling it for also!  The Still Point Inducer is used for creating calm, relieving headaches and general well-being.  A great tool!  I use it right before drifting off to sleep too.</li>
    <li> I have chronic neck and shoulder pain due to a neurological disorder.  I often cannot get comfortable enough to fall asleep.  Now, every night when I go to bed, I lay on this for about 10 - 20 minutes.  When I take my head off the inducer, I feel a warm rush...like the muscles are not cramped up and the blood is flowing.  Every now and then I wake up with a migraine, if I do, I take some asprin or Advil and lay on this for about 30 minutes and the headache is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  Wish I could find a way to use it at my office!</li>
    <li> This thing is hollow and flattens out like a pancake! I assume the \\&quot;firm\\&quot; one is solid? Otherwise this is worthless!</li>
    <li> I think the key i placing the Still Point just as it shows on the instructions. I tried one before that a friend had, but never saw the directions. It seems to work much better using it properly!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too hard...kind of hurts the back of my head, would rather have had a softer feel.  It&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but was a little disappointment in the hardness.</li>
    <li> Good product. Helps to relax  and stretch the neck muscles. Make sure you place it lower than the instructions say.</li>
    <li> very helpful for neck pain and stiffness</li>
    <li> Ouch!! Just didn&#x27;t work for my particular pain.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a certified massage therapist, not for all the outlandish things it claims to help, but for what it actually does which is to relax the muscles in the neck and head. Excellent tension reliever, and you cannot be the price through here.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s not as comfortable as the &amp;#34;Soothe-A-Ciser&amp;#34; but it may actually do more good for my neck issues.</li>
    <li> Besides it was a little smaller than I had expected, it was overall a good one with the expected material.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but the bottom of the inducer is rough like it didn&#x27;t come out if the form right.</li>
    <li> Does not work. I love craniosacral therapy and this does not produce any of the effects that I get from a practitioner. If anything, it hurts your head because it is too hard.</li>
    <li> I had terrible neck and back ache and bought this because I was getting desperate for pain relief. I tried it several times as instructed and I did feel light headed when I sat up but no real pain relief. Perhaps I wasn&#x27;t hitting the right points? If I laid on it too long I almost felt like it was giving me a migraine. I ended getting acupuncture which cured my issue. I like the idea behind this but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> I lay on this for ten minutes as directed and I get relief from my TMJ. My jaw relaxes and my muscle aches in my jaw begin to disappear. Very relaxing! Makes me almost fall asleep.</li>
    <li> The Still Point Inducer touts a large claim of the ailments it can cure/fix. Where it actually does all of this, I don&#x27;t know. I got it to help relieve tension in my lower neck and it has done a so-so job at that. So from my point of view, it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t guarantee that this works better than 2 tennis balls in a sock, but it&#x27;s compact, lightweight and does the job. I&#x27;m glad to have it and could easily stow it in a tote bag for easy access without its providing the bulk and weight of tennis balls in a sock. A tad more stylish, naturally, than its alternative...</li>
    <li> This item was delivered very quickly.  It is a great tool for tightness in your head and neck, but collapses if used on your back and shoulder area.  You will need a more solid one to use for your back area.</li>
    <li> Thank you. After using product correctly, I&#x27;ve come to enjoy and look forward to using prior to my good night sleep.</li>
    <li> Definitely have less sinus drainage since I have been using this product and not a single headache. Awesome!</li>
    <li> My clients and me all love this John Upledger (sac/crainal guru) piece.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this for at least 8 years (its been a longtime) and passing&lt;br /&gt;onto clients with chronic neck pain,people who sit for a longtime esp at a desk,neck r shoulder injury ppl,migrane sufferer&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;etc....i like to let my clients lie on it while i am giving them a harmonious healing touch thai massage session&lt;br /&gt;it presses with the weight of your head into your trigger points.  if you are in pain it is uncomfortable but that means its working so&lt;br /&gt;i highly recco that you only lie on it for 5-12 mins the first few times.&lt;br /&gt;EnJoY</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing.  Recommend you don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The Inducer does its job, although it is not exeptionally comfortable. It does relieve pressure in the back of the head if positioned correctly. If you suffer from neck/ head pain, it&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> This placed at the top of my spine at the base of the skull works!  And how sweet it is to have those strong huge muscles that travel the length of the spine on either side  RELAX.  Wonderful</li>
    <li> Does what it promised.</li>
    <li> This is almost as good as a craniosacral massage but not quite.  I prefer two racket balls taped together.  For convenience this does the trick though.</li>
    <li> The Dr recommended this to us to help relieve back pain that was causing hands to tingle witch was from the back being out of line..</li>
    <li> This does feel good when you get it positioned in the right place on your neck. However, the product has a filmy coating that makes it rather slimy to the touch. It also (the reason for two stars) smells terribly. If you&#x27;re like me, you are smell-sensitive when you have a headache. Therefore, I do not recommend this product. Needs to be made with a different material.</li>
    <li> Very good substitute for real hands to relax you.  I use it as often as I can and notice that my aches and pains are much less.</li>
    <li> This is much harder feeling than I imagined and it did not help relieve my tension headaches. Not sure if it is effective for anything. In hindsight I would just put 2 tennis balls in a sock and call it a day.</li>
    <li> We are using the Still Point Inducer with our clients at my massage business and asking our clients what they think about it. We are getting great reviews.</li>
    <li> This is the next best thing if you don&#x27;t have a craniosacral therapist handy.  It helps relieve tension from my body within 10 -20 mins of laying on it.</li>
    <li> I had a red still point inducer for years and had worn most of the color off the top.  It was awesome until I lost it.  When this one came I was not happy.  The original one was solid.  This one is somehow hollow inside and not as firm. I want to find one like the original one I bought.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable didn&#x27;t mitigate neck pain. I do not like it&lt;br /&gt;I will not use it&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend it to anybody</li>
    <li> It slides around!!!! Can&#x27;t get it to stay where it needs to without gluing it to the floor!!! It&#x27;s frustrating bc I think it would feel nice on the neck otherwise....sorry.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it my muscles got sore. But I will try it again. My recommendation is only try it 5 minutes at a time for the first few times if you have sensitive muscles.</li>
    <li> This has been a great product. I have two bulging disks in my neck and this has helped in my therapy. I use this every night before I go to bed for 5 -10 minutes. It has also helped with my migraines.</li>
    <li> This helped me so much. I am plagued with constant tension headaches. This device helps me quite a bit.  I love .. It saved me</li>
    <li> I tried this when I received it. I used it to see if I could get it in the proper spot. I didn&#x27;t want to get up. It was very relaxing and I&lt;br /&gt;just wanted to stay on it and relax. I get migraines and I used it and it seemed to lessen the pain. I use it when I need relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;Good product. I have only used it a few times but It makes me feel better.</li>
    <li> This product does feel nice on the head and sometimes provides enough relaxation to relieve congestion. It depends on severity of discomfort.</li>
    <li> It was way too hard to be comfortable, and thus the whole still-point thang was moot.  There are softer, yet more expensive, options out there.</li>
    <li> Just tried it twice yesterday but I did fall asleep on it I was so relaxed also my sinuses have been draining for 24 hours and I didn&#x27;t even know I had sinus buildup</li>
    <li> It lessens my neck pain and reduce my anxiety almost instantly.</li>
    <li> Perfect for most acupressure points on neck, shoulders, low back, etc. I use it as my pillow and my neck problems have dissapeared</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.  I was a bit unsure about it and had waffled on purchasing it for a while.  I finally decided to just try it, after all, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive. It&#x27;s so worth it- the feeling of calm that I get when I use it is worth every penny.  It helps with headaches, and releasing tension in my neck and shoulders. It seems strange that it works, but it does!</li>
    <li> As a sufferer of severe migraines and also a physician, I have tried countless medications and remedies to help abort a bad headache. This simple little gadget works, the pressure against the back of the head is very effective!</li>
    <li> Using this on a regular basis for neck/cervical issues. Sometimes i move it around the base of skull to achieve max effects. Rounded bottom would have helped in this situation. Overall, I would recommend to others..</li>
    <li> A little weird, but I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
    <li> When you begin using it, use it for only a few minutes at a time; gradually increasing the amount of time.  It&#x27;s making a difference for me.</li>
    <li> I use it when I think I am getting  a migraine. It doesn&#x27;t always stop me from getting one, but it does frequently and that in itself is a mini miracle. It takes a while to figure out where to where to place it...I did a google search for information. I would highly recommend that you try it yourself.... It was a lot less expensive than other treatment I have tried</li>
    <li> Amazing way to calm your system. I use it with all of my clients. I have given them as gifts with Peace and Calming Essential Oil. I personally use it on a daily basis before I go to sleep at night.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only OK and didn&#x27;t do much for me. I wish it&#x27;s a little softer to the trigger point area</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Great headache &amp; stress reliever!!</li>
    <li> An acupuncturist I saw told me about this for my neck pain. I tried it a few times and I&#x27;m not sure it helped.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product given the reviews. I hoped it would help me cut down on over the counter painkillers. I tried tennis balls and sock but kept rolling. I figured this device would be more stable and stay in place, but no. It was also hard to get it lined up in right spot. The plastic is also very hard. Earlier reviews say it was too soft and squishy. I wonder if the earlier device was softer? After using it for several days with not great results I developed blurry vision and color fading in my right eye. Also brain fog. Do not know if that is something to do with the eye itself - the optic nerve in the front of my head (I also have 6th cranial nerve double vision) OR if pressure from the inducer in the wrong spot on occipital lobe in the back of my head above the neck caused problems. Occipital lobe receives information from the optic nerves and transmits it to the brain for interpretation. So very concerned that right eye no longer sees the way it used to. Anyone else have a problem of this nature? I find the onset of my vision problem shortly after using this product rather strange. Please be careful when using it.</li>
    <li> Not a solid material as they claim. Too soft. Also not tall enough to be effective. Unsatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> When I have a migraine headache, I&#x27;m always trying to lay my head in a way that applies pressure in the hope I can relieve the pain and pressure. This helps tremendously. It looks a little strange, but does the trick.</li>
    <li> Great product if I could locate it.  I have looked high and low and it has disappeared.  Too bad I have lost it it was a great help with tension headaches</li>
    <li> The Still point inducer was void of any type of relief. I actually did not expecting anything, so I was not disappointed!!</li>
    <li> incredibly simple little tool that really helps relax neck</li>
    <li> As described, prompt delivery</li>
    <li> It was used and I was expecting new.  I would not have ordered it if I knew it was a used item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more self-help massaging type of equipment than I&#x27;d like to admit.  This simple thing is one of the best things I&#x27;ve tried for neck pain.  It works best if you place it on a hard surface like the floor and then you just simply lay with your head on it (line it up with the top of your ears).  Really relieves pain.  I also use it most nights in bed for about 10 minutes at night while I read.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well on the bed, but you can put a thin hardback book under it to support it.  So happy I got this, my hubby has used it and likes it too.  Feels similar to pinky balls, but this is nice b/c it stays put it the right place.</li>
    <li> Helps with my headaches</li>
    <li> This still point inducer works great!  My physical therapist recommended I buy this for use at home.  I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> My physical therapist suggested that I get this for my headaches and it works very well for getting rid of them.</li>
    <li> I have been looking at this for a long time, and am really happy I finally took a chance on it.  I have chronic neck and back pain from a car accident and surgery, and need frequent massages to function.  My favorite part is always near the end, when they do the still point induction with your fingers.  This mimics that, and I can do it whenever I feel pain or tension.  I did it for the first time the other day when I felt the pain coming on, and it went away!!  Much better than any pill, and much better for you.  If you&#x27;re in pain, I would give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist, and love Tools for self care and to recommend to clients. I am not 100% satisfied with this, not really sure it works well for me or even feel a release.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and design.  The video on the website was informative.  I bought 4 - one as a gift and 2 for the office and 1 for home.  An old chronic problem is improving with less than one week of care.</li>
    <li> Super, helps great for mechanical migraine headaches. works well for regular headaches. works great as a decongestant. super tool for going into deep meditation.</li>
    <li> It takes a bit of getting used to, but this really helps me relive tension in my neck. It needs to be used on a hard surface in order to receive the proper pressure</li>
    <li> It took a time or two to find the right position for it to work properly, but once I did, it was wonderful! You do have to be in a relaxed mode without distractions, or don&#x27;t even try it unless you want to hurt yourself! Don&#x27;t just lie flat-you need to bend your knees and tip your chin towards your chest while you&#x27;re getting it in the right position.  I do wish there was a firmer option available for those of us who have had long term use of this type of item.( I suffered a broken neck in 1980)</li>
    <li> it relieves my neck/head pains when i m laying on the couch or bed with this product. it s a excellent product!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Came in a week. Would recommend for others. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Really relieves tension and headaches but after a while it hurts a little be on my skull.</li>
    <li> as advertised--Well packaged --Very quick shipment! Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but a bit overrated, I think.</li>
    <li> I got this in an attempt to help me with tension and migraine headaches.  It definitely does not make them go away.  I does seem to help with minor neck tension though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome idea, and works pretty well. Only issue I have with it is that no matter where I am laying (my hard floor, or my bed) the unit kind of rolls over so that the base isn&#x27;t fully resting on the floor, so that the points aren&#x27;t exactly where you&#x27;d like them to be. Perhaps I should have bought the 4 point inducer.</li>
    <li> Hoped for more, I tried this for neck pain, but I did not see a difference I would probably not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love laying on this when I have a sore neck/am getting a migraine. It works better than tennis balls in a sock because it doesn&#x27;t roll around. Also when my neck is really knotted up, I will actually lay against the flat corner of this, and give myself a deeper massage. If you get headaches due to sore muscles around the base of your skull, you should try this out!</li>
    <li> This little cushion goes under the back of the head while lying on a hard surface, putting pressure on the skull at the level of the ears.  It is amazing how it gives relief of headaches without taking medication.  A great little device to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I have had neck problems forever. This is one tool that is recommended for some relief.  Its only temporary relief.</li>
    <li> This product was not miraculous for me, but I did personally benefited from this product and have experienced pain reduction.  It is easy to use and very accessible.  If you experience a stiff neck or migraines this is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My Sister-In-Law borrowed this and loved it so much I had to get another. The original one seems firmer than this newly manufactured one.</li>
    <li> I have been having severe neck pain and headaches after using this my pain have decreased drastically.  This has been wonderful</li>
    <li> I was trying to use it for my fibromyalgia trigger points and not headaches.  It didn&#x27;t work for my use, but it may for headaches.</li>
    <li> My PT recommended the tennis balls in a sock after I went through weeks of PT for neck arthritis, and still had bunched muscles and headaches.  Same concept, much cheaper, and less squishy, according to the other reviews here.    The spot under the skull at the top of the neck is a great place to reduce muscle tension, though, if you are suffering.  Give this gizmo or the tb&#x27;s a try.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> My headache disappears after laying my head on this. Beats popping headache pills and the stomachs ache that goes with it. Buy this.</li>
    <li> I lay with it on the low back part of my head, my neck and different places on my back.  This is the second one I have bought since my dog chewed the first one.  It really helps congestion, pain and stiffness.</li>
    <li> This is great for helping a mild to moderate headache. I use in as needed (which is pretty often, almost daily) for about 10 minutes at a time while lying on the floor. It does not necessarily feel comfortable or pleasant during use, but it is not painful, and the relief afterwards is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t relieve severe headaches or migraines, but it does give some relief. That means a lot when you are practically incapacitated by pain.</li>
    <li> Just not for me. I didn&#x27;t feel as though it was able to reach deep enough into the muscle to effect any relief.</li>
    <li> I have terrible migraines and thought this would help.  The problem with it for me is the placement.  I would like it if I could put it right under my neck rather than the suggested placement on the directions.  It is rather awkward.  I think it needs to be bigger and made of a material that is maybe just a little stronger.</li>
    <li> Ok but not angular enough to place correctly to fit the edge of someone&#x27;s skull.</li>
    <li> I have read several other reviews claiming that it was too soft, and smushed down too far to be useful. I am happy to say that this one- possibly because it&#x27;s the Original- is firm enough to apply a proper amount of pressure to the base of the skull where it meets the neck. I am pleased with this and it has definitely relieved tension in my neck and shoulders. Although I don&#x27;t usually suffer from nasal congestion allergies, I did notice that my sinuses did feel clearer as well.</li>
    <li> if you have a hectic sched like I do this is a savior!! I have meditation tracks on my IPOD and relax back on this for 20 or 30 mins and all the stress goes away!! I have turned others on to it and they love it as well.. don&#x27;t get discouraged &#x27;cause YES.. it&#x27;s pretty uncomfortable when you 1st start using it.... you will get the hang of proper placement and it&#x27;s well worth the effort!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. Our work massage therapist recommended it to me and its so great. If you suffer from stiff neck or headaches/migraines, I would definitely recommend this. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have degenerative arthritis in my neck. It hurts all of the time &amp; I have spent so much money on every kind of pillow &amp; contraption there is. The only kind of physical therapy that has helped is &amp;#34;head pulling.&amp;#34; Head pulling, as much as I can understand it, gets the blood / fluid flowing in the neck joints. This little contraption seems to do the same to a point. It does NOT go under your neck but more in line with your eyes. The feeling that I get is a gentle separation in my neck. Yes the little nubs dig in to the head a bit but it helps the neck pain. It is not a cure or a miracle but it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re: using tennis balls in a sock: this is much more stable &amp; solid.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t like this tool.  I think it is too hard and I find it painful to use.  A few of my clients agree.  I am a massage therapist.  There may be someone who likes it and I may be able to use it still in my practice.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it all the time and she loves it. She asks why I didn&#x27;t get her one sooner.</li>
    <li> My clients seem to be comfortable during massage.  I use it when I feel a little disconnected or anxious.</li>
    <li> I get frequent muscle spasms and tension in my neck due to past injuries, because of that I get frequent headaches. When I tried PT for my headaches, the therapist would do something similar with his fingers to release the tension. So I thought why not try one of these. I keep it on my nightstand and use it whenever needed. It works great!</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift from my best friend, who is a massage therapist.  She gave it to me for relief of my chronic migraines. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it for migraine relief yet as I only got it a few days ago, but I have been using it 2-3 times per day anyhow. It really gives me a feeling of peace and calm relaxation after using it.  I also have noted that it helps with my sinus drainage and congestion caused by environmental allergies (outdoor mold).  I feel so chilled out after using this thing that literally nothing bothers me for a few hours.  It&#x27;s important to get it placed just right, my friend helped me figure that out  when she gave it to me. But once you hit that sweet spot and just let your head rest on it for about 10 minutes...it&#x27;s amazing.  I recommend this item highly. Next time I get a headache I will try it out and report back on its usefulness for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I love it so far!  It relieves pain when I have a potential migraine coming on and relieves tension in my neck.  I can lay on it while I watch TV at night, which makes it easier to incorporate into my daily routine.  (Not the recommended procedure from the inventor, but I&#x27;m much more likely to do it while I&#x27;m relaxing than to find 20 minutes in my day to meditate, just being real!)  The cool feeling that spreads across the back of your head when you get up is crazy and shows that SOMETHING is being done.</li>
    <li> This thing reeked of mold, and therefore it made a preexisting headache much worse upon first use. I have no idea if it actually is effective. since it was too malodorous. Sent it back.</li>
    <li> Our PT told us to order this to relief headaches. And it really really works. I sit with the base of my skull leaning on it and I can feel the pressure release!</li>
    <li> Does work, like that pictures shows.  If you lay like that, then it does not put pressure on the sore part of your neck and if you do try to make, then it tips over.</li>
    <li> Used once, never felt the value.</li>
    <li> WAY TO SOFT- doesn&#x27;t do anything and doesn&#x27;t stay in place when you lay on it, seems to want to flip on it&#x27;s side.  The theory of putting pressure on the points to release pressure is great but this product is not the one to do it.  Not sure if I will try the firmer one or not, wish I could find something that does what this description says, that would be great.  Also tried the Necflex Neck Stretcher and Neck Massager in same order it didn&#x27;t do as stated either.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my acupuncturist for my tension headaches and it has really helped! Turns out, I keep my head in an unnatural position for a long period of time which causes muscle tension, stretching and fatigue, which causes the headaches. She said to start out using it for just 2 to 3 minutes once or twice per day for a week, then work my way up to the normal 15 minutes several times per day. She said that&#x27;s why most people have problems with it - because when they start using it they do it for the 15 minutes that it states on the box. Your muscles need time to adjust to that pressure. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with tension headaches! Shipping was normal and the product was in perfect condition but the box that the product comes in (not the shipping box) was smushed a bit. I have not used the cd that came with it but I thought itt was nice to include it.</li>
    <li> These shoe are a very nice fit but runs about a half size smaller, .i .e, if you&#x27;re a size 9, order a 9.5. Other than that, they are very comfortable.</li>
    <li> After a few mins resting on it, my headaches disappear. Much healthier way to go rather than pills or analgesics NSAIDs that can harm other areas of your body.</li>
    <li> simple. provides relief.</li>
    <li> I got to0 aggressive with mine when I decided to use it on my lower back and cracked it.  The foam split...oh, well.  It would hold up to regular use, though.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like it.  I can&#x27;t seem to get it into the right position.  I would like to have returned it.  I never got into &amp;#34;The Zone&amp;#34; with this.</li>
    <li> You will feel better after lying on the Still Point Inducer for 15 minutes!  It is simple and it works.  Try it!</li>
    <li> We can&#x27;t help but laugh at this design, but it sure works.  I purchased this on the recommendation of my physical therapist.  It has helped to reduce my neck pain, and is also helpful for pressure at the base of my head when I&#x27;m suffering from a migraine.  It&#x27;s firm, but not too hard, and it&#x27;s not squishy like a stress ball, it&#x27;s somewhere in between.  I&#x27;m very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> as advertised... works well</li>
    <li> It works ok, I just wished it was a little more firmer.</li>
    <li> Far too hard...... gave both my wife and I headaches......</li>
    <li> I have been using this from time to time and I have seen a reduction in my headaches.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works exactly, but it does.  I went to YouTube and watched videos on the proper way to use it and followed that.</li>
    <li> The base is slippery so you lie your head on it and it slides away from you.  Don&#x27;t order it!</li>
    <li> I used this at a massage therapy continued education class and had to order myself one, and for my clients</li>
    <li> This smelled so terrible that I couldn&#x27;t even use it. It smells like chemicals.</li>
    <li> Made well but for me it is very uncomfortable to use. I&#x27;ve tried manny possitions and my headaches feel worse when I get up sometimes. I&#x27;ve tried it on the floor and my bed. It just didn&#x27;t help me. Like all products everyone&#x27;s different and it may work for you.</li>
    <li> I used to try to use a tennis ball. This is so much better</li>
    <li> I like it. It worked for me the first time I used it, and I actually fell asleep on it, I was so relaxed. It is the consistency or firmness of a rubber ball, if that helps, and puts no pressure on the head or neck. Supports the head and allows neck to relax. I used it for a pinched nerve in my neck that caused pain in my shoulder and arm. It relieved it right away and for many hours. I&#x27;m happy with the product and I would probably buy it again if I were unaware of it being a pain reliever.</li>
    <li> OK maybe this little gadget didn&#x27;t actually save my life, but it&#x27;s still a miracle. I have arthritis that&#x27;s caused some disk degeration in my neck. I get some very tight muscles in my shoulder blades and my neck. With the exception of one wonderful physical therapist this simple little red plastic tool does the best job of trigger point pressure I&#x27;ve ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;Get this! It will save your like - or at least save your sanity.</li>
    <li> I have back problems and this still point inducer is really relaxing. I had one and lost it and so I bought this replacement.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this item. The idea is to simulate still point, but it&#x27;s far too small for an adult head and it slips when placed properly. I&#x27;m very disapointed. I am an LMT, one of my areas of focus is Craniosacral, I would not reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> this product  does work at releasing your spinal column and tendons going down your spine.  However, you  really have to work at relaxing .  It is really stiff and has no give so you have to work on making yourself relax around it.</li>
    <li> a simple and effective product to take some time out, 15 minutes will refresh you mentally and physically. well worth a try</li>
    <li> This is a great device.  It relieves my neck tension and congestion. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works for those headaches and settles my mind.</li>
    <li> I like the product...just the right firmness but it took forever to get here</li>
    <li> It may be fine, but I&#x27;m not really using it.  I probably shouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  Four more words required.</li>
    <li> Everyone who suffers from migraines should have one of these. They treat my migraines better than medicine. It was weird to get used to at first, but then I got used to the feeling and it was amazing</li>
    <li> i would have liked for it to have worked, but i didn&#x27;t get anything from using the head rester. every once in a while i give it a go.</li>
    <li> This is not for me but I gave it to somewhat who really likes it.  I never found a way to use it that helped; it did not support altas as I had expected.  It did work better on the floor than on a firm bed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to dismiss the value of this product. I have pretty severe neck issues from 2 car accidents. I would say it is moderately helpful for this type of pain.</li>
    <li> My physical therapist recommended this to me.  Whenever I feel tension in the occipital region of my head I use this and it helps the muscles in my neck relax.  Helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended trying a still point inducer to assist with congestion and neck/shoulder pain.  I was optimistic about this item and excited to try it when it arrived.  Unfortunately, it was very hard and put uncomfortable pinpoint pressure on the back of the head when positioned according to the instructions.  I think the size and strength of it was designed for someone of a much larger statcher.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on a recommendation from my physical therapist. Works great to relax the muscles at the base of my head - a must with a desk job!</li>
    <li> My PT recommended that I get this.</li>
    <li> With daily use, the Still Point Inducer has given me relief of chronic neck pain and tension headaches. In addition, 15-20 minutes daily use can really help to reduce stress and tension. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have chronic migraines and use the still point inducer almost daily to relive the pressure in my neck. I have and do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Was given to a family member who says it is very helpful.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom who is having bad headaches.</li>
    <li> Love this. So relaxing. I swear it helps set me up for a great night&#x27;s sleep</li>
    <li> As soon as it arrived, I tried it on a friend who told me he could actually feel his neck relaxing and that it felt \\&quot;like things were opening up\\&quot;. He thought it was amazing.. his words(a 68 yr old male who has never been to a chiropractor/osteopath.. but was amazed that it really relaxed his neck, opened things up and he claimed it was very comfortable as well.</li>
    <li> Taking ten minutes a few days a week to use the still point inducer has made a tremendous difference in my feeling of well being. My neck holds less tension and I feel more clear-headed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to position this for optimum effectiveness.  I will have to continue to do more research on the benefits of using this.</li>
    <li> I bought this to relax and help with headaches.  It is a bit firm and can hurt a little at first even when positioned correctly but once you relax it really does relieve tension.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my Yoga buddies. I have found it very relaxing to use. I try to do it at least two or more times a day.</li>
    <li> It was not as firm as the one I had previously. It was too soft for me to gain benefit</li>
    <li> Relieves my headaches fast!</li>
    <li> This is the original product - as advertised and at an exceptional price.  I&#x27;m a massage therapist and use this for my person use.</li>
    <li> Not hard enough to really push hard on my trigger points in the occipital area. Too squishy.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these on the recommendation of my massage therapist.  It&#x27;s awesome, I have arthritis in my neck and shoulders.  It&#x27;s so relaxing I fall asleep on it and I have not slept that well in 37 years.</li>
    <li> At the end of the day, if I have a headache or am just tight all over, I use this just before bed.  It will take my headache away in 5 minutes! also will relax my whole body and mind if I am wound tight!</li>
    <li> I first tried a still point inducer years ago for neck pain. Now I use it mainly as a neck support in a whirlpool tub.</li>
    <li> A massage therapist recommended this and I thought it was so inexpensive that I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve slept better each night that I&#x27;ve used it and had far fewer morning headaches.  I have no idea how it works, but I&#x27;m packing for a trip today and I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> Works well if used for 5-10 minutes even. Has the ability to ease pain and stiffness very quickly. Affordable as well.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> What I expected. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> First, concerning complaints that this is not a muscle relaxer, or doesn&#x27;t provide the type of trigger point release achieved by the tennis ball and sock approach: it&#x27;s not supposed to.  This is an entirely different type of product. Just think of the difference between a deep tissue massage and a cranio-sacral massage.  The still-point inducer  is designed to temporarily stabilize the flow of cerebral fluid, which brings about a sense of profound relaxation throughout the body, setting the body in a position to heal itself.  You need to cooperate with the inducer: set up a tranquil environment, turn off the constant chatter in your mind, free the room of distractions, and RELAX.  I frequently find myself about to fall asleep while using this.</li>
    <li> I have used this about 7 times now, it was recommended by a medical massage therapist.  It does provide temporary relief of headaches, but mine do not go away for the day.  I have tried every technique to rid myself of headaches; natural supplements, vitamins, prescriptions, therapies, chiropractors and treatments with the exception of acupuncture.  I was hoping for more from this product.</li>
    <li> This is great for the upper neck pain caused by stress and leaning forward all day.  Size and composition are perfect and offers lots of relief.</li>
    <li> came quickly and as promised - would use seller again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have another that is much firmer than this one and like it better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to see if it would help with my neck pain that&#x27;s been causing headaches. The item arrived pretty quickly with Prime. I ordered it Sunday and it arrived Tuesday - nice. Gave it a try and I could instantly feel it working. I laid down on my yoga mat on the floor for 20 minutes and it felt good. Will have to try it again everyday for a week to get a good idea if it really works. But so far, so good. Updating my first review, the foam feels good when I use it, but I am not getting the relief I expected. I even tried a few other things my physical therapist suggested. I can only say that my headache issue must be caused by something else that this foam block can&#x27;t help with. It might work for someone else but I gave it a try. I still like it.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as I had hoped but I can tell a difference.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really help relieve my neck pain at all. the benefit is that it&#x27;s fun to carry tiny red boobs around.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay under my head very well.  It falls over and I have to hold it with my hands to keep it upright.</li>
    <li> I was rear ended on the freeway in November of 2012. I started massage therapy for whiplash about two weeks later because I started to get severe headaches. The massage was helping but I still needed to do some preventive work on my own to help alleviate the tension in my neck. My therapist suggested the still point inducer and now I use it every time I get a headache. Sometimes I have a lower back pain and I will lay with ice on my back and use the still point as well just because it&#x27;s so relaxing. 15 minutes is all you need.</li>
    <li> I have been on regular chiropractic maintenance for neck, shoulder and upper back pain for years. This thing is great for in between appointments or just whenever you need to relax. In addition to using it on the back of the head, it works very well on knots in neck, back and shoulders. Just place the bumps under the painful area and lay down. If you wiggle every few minutes to get deeper into the knot and reposition to work your way down the muscle, you can actually feel a difference. Almost as good as my massage therapist (but don&#x27;t tell her I said that!). I even purchased one as a gift for a friend who gets those awful knots right inside the shoulder blades like I do. He loves it too.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.  I think this minimum word requirement is silly because I&#x27;m helping you here.</li>
    <li> Great for pressure point relief. Good travel size</li>
    <li> This item was a total waste of money. You can&#x27;t get it on the right spot and your head just rolls around.</li>
    <li> The still point inducer (the red item) is very helpful (I use it on my lower back for pressure points).  The CD and other stuff that came with it seem quite pointless.</li>
    <li> I have had headaches my entire life.  My tension is in my neck shoulders and at the base of my scalp.  My Dr. told me about these and they are fantastic!</li>
    <li> This little device is AMAZING!  I&#x27;ve had chronic headaches for my entire life and up til now, nothing really ever helped much.  When I saw this online (while looking for something else, go figure) it caught my eye immediately.  Most of my headaches start at the back of my skull, and I knew this would at least have potential to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came in a couple of days later, I immediately tried it out.  Like I said, I have chronic headaches, pretty much on a daily basis.  It really works.  Not only did it help ease the headache pain, but it also eased the tension in my neck and thru out the rest of my spine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed it to my doctor when I went in for my next appointment, and he ordered one as well.  He explained to me that there are two major ligaments that run exactly where this device is to be placed.  He&#x27;s a doctor of osteopathic medicine and had recently been to a seminar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually purchased several of these for friends and relatives.  Any time someone mentions to me that they have chronic headaches or neck pain, I sign on to Amazon and order one of these for them.  So far, everyone is in 100% agreement with me.  They are amazed at how such a simple little device can offer so much help.</li>
    <li> I am living with my sister while I get chemo. I forgot my still point inducer and got this one. It works great. It is softer than the one I have at home, so does not work as well to get my back muscles to release.</li>
    <li> Using it several times a day. Seems to Erik but believe it will take some time and practice.</li>
    <li> this did NOTHING for me- foam is too soft to support my head/neck even slightly. and it has an odd smell. item was returned</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do a thing, does not stay in position at all. I have not used anything similar, however as far as I am concerned it is only taking up spaces</li>
    <li> not what I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Not firm enough so just okay from me.</li>
    <li> i heaar it works and it did cure my hiccups when using it.  lol</li>
    <li> as described.  This recommended for me by the cranio-sacral therapist - following a car accident with head injury.</li>
    <li> This tool really works.  It makes resting so much easier once the sore spots in the occipital region calm down.</li>
    <li> This seems a little tall for me and because the foam is a bit slippery on the back of my hair, I find it hard to get it in the right position and then have my head stay there, which is of course the opposite of what you want when you&#x27;re trying to relax! I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> My physical therapist told me to get this to help with neck stiffing from sitting on the computer all day. It helps</li>
    <li> My chiropractor recommend I buy this.  So far, it has helped my neck while doing my exercise on the floor since I can&#x27;t lay my head flat on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied.</li>
    <li> does the trick for the most part, I still like to use my hands to hold someones head and feel the release but this can be put under the head while you work the feet legs or arms, to ready it for stretches.</li>
    <li> I know there are some folks who love this product. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive and found it uncomfortable to lie on. Others felt it was too soft, but I found it to be too hard. I&#x27;m better off with two soft tennis balls in a thick sock. They&#x27;re easier to position, and I can adjust the pressure by varying the thickness of the sock I put them in. Just my two cents.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my physical therapist for neck pain.  After using it a couple of times, including with supervision from a licensed massage therapist who specialized in neurofascial release, it made the scalenes much tighter which caused the upper back to get sore and tightened.  I now need to spend the big bucks on more massage to undo what this product has done.  Oh by the way, I fired my physical therapist.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable. Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money. It certainly does not do what it is advertised to do, for me, anyway.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to hit pressure points on my neck % head, but this turned out to be a little too soft for my needs.</li>
    <li> I have used it a few times but the construction needs to be tweaked, like on the bottom....It needs to have a slant to not tip when the head is laying on it.  I think you can get the same treatment with a couple of tennis balls in a sock.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately again it did absolutely nothing. Sorry, Bruce</li>
    <li> If used properly still point inducer is a wonderful tool for balance and health. Must locate to proper place for placement.</li>
</ol>
