<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product.  My hair is chin length and I need only a very small nickel size amount.  Plus, my hair is fine and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Smells great but I have a hard time getting it through my processed hair and it seems as though I use a huge handful each time just to get it over my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter hair.  It is natural and has just made it soft over time.  The breakage is minimal.  The price is great.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Luxurious, smells great, and keeps on thickening and moisturizing my hair over time while other shampoos lose their effect.</li>
    <li> Got it for my ex, she loves it</li>
    <li> I have 3c4a thick curly natural hair and this is my everything.  I loved it so much I would use it as my co wash but i had to stop due to the price.  It moisturizers and the smell it amazing. My hair is soft and defined every time I use this, I just love it so much. The only problem is getting it out of the bottle.  If only the gave more product for the price, my life would be set.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isnt bad, its not like anything I&#x27;ve ever smelt before.</li>
    <li> I use this with the [[ASIN:B004Y5M8QQ Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo 8.5 FL OZ]]. This is the dynamic duo for my fine, thin, normal hair that needs volume and as much help as is possible with shedding and breaking. I got some fragile locks and this stuff has been the cat&#x27;s meow on them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best smelling conditioner I have ever used. There are a few that come close but none that can top it. It moisturizes very well without leaving my hair limp, lank, and lifeless. The curse of fine thin hair that&#x27;s not uber dry is that many/most conditioners just weigh you down -- and by mid day your hair is a bunch of bah humbug&#x27;ness that makes you want to skip out on any form of mirror or reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a ton, it does distribute well in my hair, and it provides a medium amount of slip. I prefer \\&quot;grabby\\&quot; conditioners that don&#x27;t make my hair feel like I waxed it up like a surf board. It&#x27;s enough slip to comb through easily - and that&#x27;s what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels soft, has volume, and (MOST importantly) I have found this combo (shampoo and conditioner) to really decrease the breakage and shedding I have. My hair is stronger and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do need to point out that I would not recommend this conditioner to someone with coarse very thick hair that requires a lot of slip in order to get out tangles and such. While I think this *could* work for that type I would be a bit scared at how much product you&#x27;d need. The cost of this stuff per month could be like an Iphone. My daughter has very very thick mixed hair that requires about 1/2 c. of conditioner just to be able to comb through. This is an 8.5 oz bottle -- you can do the math!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fine haired gals/guys this is a superb find. Curly or straight it works awesome. I do rotate it with [[ASIN:B0046IN00Y Curl Junkie Beauticurls Strengthening Hair Conditioner, 12 fl. oz.]] because I find mixing it up a bit helps my hair to stay in top notch shape and between both of them my hair is loving me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also just have to give a shout out to the ladies at the Carol&#x27;s Daughters store in Pentagon City. They were fantastic, knowledgable, and immensely helpful to me (and patient!). Thanks girls!ing me!    I also just have to give a shout out to the ladies at the Carol&#x27;s Daughters store in Pentagon City. They were fantastic, knowledgable, and immensely helpful to me (and patient!). Thanks girls!</li>
    <li> I would give this product five starts if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.  I got a sample for the shampoo, conditioner and hair mask and fell in love with this line. When I ran out I decided to buy just the conditioner because its SO hard to find a conditioner that works for my hair (but I would get all of them if they cost a little less.)  I have very fine straight hair. Last summer I thought my hair was boring so I decided to get a perm to make it wavy and super model-like. Well, the perm didn&#x27;t exactly turn out that way and I regret the day I ever thought about doing it. Now my hair is super dry from the perm and from my everyday use o flat iron.  This product leaves my hair silky without wearing it down. Plus, as others have mentioned, it smells soooo good, kind of like coconuts. Will definitely keep buying.</li>
    <li> Makes hair strong and does not tangle my kinda hair which is curly to wavy and very thick.  Helps keep my hair from breaking so it can finally grow.</li>
    <li> note: since I use the shampoo and the conditioner together this review covers both as a \\&quot;team\\&quot; and I&#x27;ve left basically the same review for the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t give out five stars unless a product is pretty flawless; it has to meet or exceed its product claims, be fairly priced for what it claims to do, and have no obvious tweaks needed to make it better. This trifecta of excellence is rarer than you think but with this conditioner and its sister shampoo my hair has finally met its perfect match ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: I am 42 years old, biracial with very curly, slightly kinky hair. It is fine textured, light to medium density, and breaks VERY, VERY easily. My hair is not chemically processed so I occasionally use a flat iron or curling iron for styling. Mostly I wear a medium length afro style these days with Jane Carter Solution Wrap and Roll, 8.5 Ounce as a styling aid to define the curls. Over the years I have used exclusive salon products like Ouidad, drug store brands, high end department store like Fekkai, earthy brands like Ojon, and just about everything in between. The results always left me searching for something that would help my hair feel and look healthy and strong. With all the trial and error I never found any one or two products that worked well enough to satisfy my needs. I can&#x27;t comment as to how the conditioner works alone since I have used the shampoo as well from day one, but as far as my experience using both products I&#x27;d say that Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner produced results better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first shampoo and conditioner treatment I proceeded to comb through my hair while it was still wet, a task that usually involves a considerable amount of pulling and results in the inevitable huge hair ball that winds up tangled on the comb. With the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi products the amount of hairs on the comb was only about a quarter of what was usually shed with my former shampoo and conditioner. Suffice to say I was floored.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;92% reduction in breakage\\&quot; printed right there on the label is a pretty big claim to make and I was *very* skeptical of such a bold statement. I would have had no qualms about requesting refund if this product fell short of my expectations but this shampoo along with the conditioner delivers on its claims. With the first use I had about 75% less breakage than with my former products and the results have remained steady over six months of use. I waited to post this review because I wanted to see if I would need to switch products either due to the seasons changing or to see if buildup would happen or if the results would taper off; I&#x27;ve seen consistently EXCELLENT results over the months and for the first time ever as far as shampoos and conditioners goes I feel I have FINALLY found \\&quot;the one\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of both the shampoo and conditioner is fabulous; leaves a light scent on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave weight or residue on my hair with either the shampoo or conditioner which is VERY important since my hair is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what seems like forever my hair was constantly the same length due to breakage but in the months since switching to Carol&#x27;s Daughter I&#x27;ve gained over an inch of length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive* but worth it and that&#x27;s something I say very RARELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit 01/12: recently I&#x27;ve seen the price jump here to almost double what I&#x27;ve paid; if listed here for more than eighteen dollars you&#x27;ll likely be able to \\&quot;search\\&quot; this for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily, happily and 100% recommended!ioner.

The scent of both the shampoo and conditioner is fabulous; leaves a light scent on the hair.   Does not leave weight or residue on my hair with either the shampoo or conditioner which is VERY important since my hair is fine.   For what seems like forever my hair was constantly the same length due to breakage but in the months since switching to Carol&#x27;s Daughter I&#x27;ve gained over an inch of length.  My hair is soft and manageable.  Expensive* but worth it and that&#x27;s something I say very RARELY.   *Edit 01/12: recently I&#x27;ve seen the price jump here to almost double what I&#x27;ve paid; if listed here for more than eighteen dollars you&#x27;ll likely be able to \\&quot;search\\&quot; this for less.  Easily, happily and 100% recommended!</li>
    <li> Honest to goodness, I am loosing far less hair than I was before. This product, along with the shampoo, is working amazingly well for me. The drain doesn&#x27;t lie!</li>
    <li> I will only use Carol&#x27;s daughter products on my fine, curly hair!</li>
    <li> It has taken me 30 years to find an intense conditioner that my daughters and I can use that does not cause us to break out with acne...this is it! I was leery about spending the money on such a small bottle but it doesn&#x27;t take much product to do the job. My daughter and I have shoulder length hair and we both use it daily... a bottle lasts us about a month. We have very hard water and were having issues with our hair being dry but every conditioner (and I think I have tried just about every brand on the market)made us break out. When I explained this to the sales girl, this is what she recommended. We have been using it for about 3 months now and my 17 year old still raves about the change in her hair. Smells nice too... well worth the money. Maybe I can finally grow my hair out!</li>
    <li> At first I was leery at spending $18 for a shampoo and $20 for a conditioner that might not work. I also have always thought this brand to be aimed more to African American women. But the sales lady at Sephora convinced me anyone with damaged hair would benefit from it.The Shampoo and Conditioner are pretty much the best hair products I have found in so many years.  I am from a mixed background (indigenous Indian/Caribbean/Spanish) so my hair is naturally frizzy curls, that the curls eventually fade and my hair is one giant puff ball and with years of the hot iron its now dry and brittle.  I saw a change instantly on the first try. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and I see my hair has transformed. No more clumps of hair in the drain, I can run my hand through my hair and come up with no hair on the floor. Less breakage for sure and all around healthy shiny look. I am so happy with my hair now. Even when I don&#x27;t use heat to straighten my hair, my curls are soft and bouncey, and need a little leave in conditioner to keep the style all day. I have People definitely noticed the change. I will keep buying until my hair resists its awesomeness. My only gripe is the selling price on here for $33! There&#x27;s no way I am paying for that. Sephora.com has the conditioner for $20 and the shampoo for $18.  I have seen a crazy inflation all across amazon.com for this product.  The only reasonably priced item in this line is the hair mask, which runs at $29 on Sephora.com. But if you add the shipping, its about the same. If you have unmanageable frizzy dry unhappy hair, give this a shot. Just not from here :P</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this Product and how it makes my hair feel.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t deal with the bottle.  Hard to open and close with wet hands.</li>
    <li> I have coarse unruly hair (and am caucasian).. this conditioner really tames my hair!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Carol&#x27;s Daughter and all of their products. I have very curly hair that easily dries out. Every product I use by them makes my hair feel and look healthy.</li>
    <li> The seller is great, the product its excellent I love my hair the way it looks and feels, I recommend the conditioner and the mask!!!!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are both amazing.  My hair has never been this shiny and silky!  I get more compliments on my hair when I use these 2 together</li>
    <li> Love this for my 3b-3c hair.  Great conditioner and strengthener.  I overprocessed my hair with dye - my hair is very fine.  So while I have tight coils and shrinkage, it is very fine. The shampoo and conditioner worked great for me.</li>
    <li> I find this way too heavy and rich for my fine hair that is prone to the &amp;#34;oilies&amp;#34;, but on my daughter&#x27;s super dry hair, it is AMAZING. We&#x27;ve tried all sorts of conditioners, leave-ins and oils. They all either don&#x27;t moisturize enough or are too heavy. This conditioner moisturizes nicely, keeps her frizz under control and smells HEAVENLY. I can&#x27;t stop smelling her hair after we condition it! We&#x27;re trying to find this fragrance as a perfume as now!</li>
    <li> This is a new fave product of mine. It works wonderfully with Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo, and leaves my hair soft, shiny, and healthy. It is worth every dollar. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner, makes my hair so smooth, silky and smelling amazing! Love this stuff and it was the best thing I found! I bought some of the shampoo and conditioner for my mom as well and we both love it! We will definitely stick to it! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Perfect for me and my stubborn hair. I use it together with the Shampoo and it is like having a Spa treatment for my hair and me. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have fine, tangle-prone, color treated hair that comes to below my shoulder. This does a decent job detangling my hair and leaves it looking fairly moisturized and frizz free. And that&#x27;s no small feat because my hair is pretty fried. I really like the smell. The price is a bit of a deterrent, but if I can&#x27;t find any better options I will stick with it.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend. As I was applying conditioner I instantly saw  a shine appear . Also was able to detangle with this in my hair</li>
    <li> your hair will feel so refresh i have been using this product for over 4 years now.</li>
    <li> If you tried Carol&#x27;s Daughter products before and hated them...TRY THIS. This makes my hair so soft and I even sometimes use it as a leave-in!</li>
    <li> I am just trying this for the very first time. I have been pleased with the softness and tangle free results that I have gotten.</li>
    <li> After using this product, I still experienced breakage. Won&#x27;t be buying again, the products are overrated.</li>
    <li> I keep this product in my hair for around 30 minutes and my hair is beautfulll!!, my hair is type 3B and type 3C and it keeps my hair soft and it keeps moisture better. Though the product is a bit pricey, it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the first time about a little over a month ago and love it. It makes my hair feel soft and fresh. I love the clean smell that it leaves. My hair is relaxed and I don&#x27;t rush for a new relaxer because this makes my hair feel soft and manageable. I am a licensed cosmetologist so trust me when I say that it works.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT SMELLS VERY GOOD AND IT ALSO WORKS VERY WELL AND MY HAIR HAS A TREMENDOUS TRANSFORMATION IN IT&#x27;S MANAGEABILITY.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Used Monoi Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner for approx. 2 months starting in Dec. 2013.  Once the Repairing shampoo had done its job, continued to use the Monoi Repairing Conditioner along with the Hair Milk co-wash.  The conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth and manageable.  I also use the Hair Milk leave in conditioner ( it can be used daily) and have achieved results I only used to get from my stylist.  I would recommend this product to those who are looking for soft manageable hair without be weighted down or greasy or slick feeling.  It is simply the best hair care line I have found to date.</li>
    <li> I purchased the CD Monoi Shampoo &amp; Conditioner at the same time.  One or both immediately caused my scalp to itch to the point where I had to shampoo a few times with my previous shampoo to reduce the itching.  Also, my hair felt very dry afterward, and my comb didn&#x27;t go through my hair smoothly after conditioning.  &#x27;Back to WEN I go.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after my stylist recommended this brand - had never heard of it and it was a bit pricey at the salon.  (I have waist length, fine hair and am using the Monio Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner, as well as the Split End serum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t blown away after the first wash, although I did immediately enjoy the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the third wash that did it.  I noticed my hair was shinier, softer to the touch, and got tangled less frequently.  (Pssst!  A dab will do ya with the serum; too much and your hair is weighed down - I have a lot of hair, and I use about a jelly bean size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since recommended it to my gal pals and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> so this product actually has Sodium Laureth Sulfate, the same ingredient the shampoo boasts of not having. Sulfates create more lather and strips your hair of its natural moisture, leaving your hair dry and susceptible to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;i bought the conditioner because i co wash more than i shampoo and i couldn&#x27;t believe one of the main ingredients was Sodium Laureth Sulfate!!!&lt;br /&gt;i thought this company was a hair improvement based company, not one that tries to trick its customers. The average person is going to buy the shampoo and conditioner, but what use are they if one the more harmful ingredients on hair is in the conditioner and then boast of it not being in the shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;very disappointing, i expected WAY better from Carols Daughters.....</li>
    <li> My extra long hair has stopped being ripped out and falling out after brushing.  We saw this product demonstrated and thought we would give it a try.  I have waist length hair and always had a pile of hair on the floor, in the car, and almost everywhere until now.  This product works.</li>
    <li> this product lived up to its other customer reviews.Glad i bought this after receiving some samples in the mail!Works fab on colored hair!</li>
    <li> Smells good and does what it says. My hair smells like this for a few days just from this conditioner and no added leave in (i.e. cd monoi oil serem or spray) also if you use a different shampoo and conditioner your next shampoo you will still smell this in your hair afterwards and ive also used the monoi conditioner and cowashed every few days after and the scent lasted thru 2 cowashes. I feel this shows how high quality this product is.</li>
    <li> I have long, color-treated, aging hair--early 40s.  And this conditioner is amazing.  I don&#x27;t use it every shampoo.  I&#x27;m a Wen girl.  But when I do use it, I think I experience less breakage.  My hair is super soft after using, and the product smells delicious.</li>
    <li> I love this line of products from carol&#x60;s daughter, i&#x27;m happy i found it on amazon because this is the cheapest price and i use a lot of conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product and happy I purchased it. On a scale 1-10.....I give it a 10. Carol&#x27;s daughter is an amazing product. It does exactly what it says I will do.</li>
    <li> It really works. Hair breakage have been reduced 100 percent. Will definitely continue to try and use it although it&#x27;s expensive just for a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I color my naturally curly, frizzy hair and use every appliance to straighten it so you can only imagine what kind of damage it has endured. I was hoping for another miracle but unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s a nice average conditioner for me. I&#x27;m hoping her other products will help.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed a sample so bought full size. Its ok, smells great/  My fine hair becomes more fly-away....I still  prefer Wen.however.</li>
    <li> love it! I felt the softness and less breakage after the rinse.</li>
    <li> The Manoi line is the best carols daughter product. I am african american this product makes hair soft and managable. Ohhh did i mention it really does limit shedding.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  It is true that it will improve your hair overnight.  It has made such an improvement on my baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> this stuff is AMAZING.... it smells sooooo good. i use the shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels so soft and manageable after using versus feeling dry and rough.</li>
    <li> Excellent products...I live in the Caribbean and have sun bleached hair that is also colored from time to time...these products make my hair feel great again!</li>
    <li> Works great, everything you want and expect out of a conditioner. I have chemically straightened hair, and this is perfect for it.</li>
    <li> So good, damage free and smells divine!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does what it states. It has stopped the breakage and my hair has started growing back, and it&#x27;s a lot stronger and healthier. This will be the only product I use on my hair from now on.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful and it leaves my hair so soft and managable. I think I will be using this line more often.</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner is the best conditioner EVER! It not only smells amazing but is sulfate free with all the other great benefits of this product. I love love love this conditioner and will definitely try other Carol&#x27;s Daughters products. It is worth every penny!!!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo and a sample of the conditioner with a purchase from Sephora.  After using the samples I fell in love with these products.  When used together they made my hair feel better than ever before.  I immediatly came to Amazon and purchased both as the price was lowere here then at Sephora.  It is my new go to shampoo and conditioner.  My hair looks good for days when I use these.  I would highly recommend.  If you compare the different sellers of these products on Amazon you can find one that will save you quite a bit.  And when combined with Prime shipping it&#x27;s really a great deal.</li>
    <li> Hair is soft and managable</li>
    <li> Love it can&#x27;t do without</li>
    <li> Hello soft hair, goodbye frizzy dry hair. Love this product. It&#x27;s got a nice, gentle, smell also. Again, this product came to me from my It-girl pal from Pasadena. She never steers me wrong. If you have colored hair, (not that I&#x27;m saying I do...) you&#x27;ll love this product. Shiny soft and good smelling girl hair.</li>
    <li> A little expensive but worth every penny, it leaves your hair very soft and shiny.  I highly recommended it to everyone</li>
    <li> I did not think that this product performed any better than a store bought repairing shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It cost me a lot more and I cannot return it because of amazons return policy of used items. I lost a lot of money!</li>
    <li> This product was no different than the Dark and Lovely products I use, not worth the money. My hair has a lot more shine with Dark and Lovely products. One good thing is the smell.</li>
    <li> I really liked this.  The smell was awesome.  I did, however, turn out to be allergic to something in the formula and had to discontinue usage.  That&#x27;s why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter n grandaughter, its great its true it corrects 98% of breakage. it works great on all hair, thanx Lisa Price u did a great job. also her Milk is great to for the hair</li>
    <li> Goes great with the monoi oil shampoo.  My har is color treated, and usually very dry and frizzy,.  THis with the sulfate free shampooo is reversing the damage.  After about a week, I can really tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Monoi Repairing conditioner and shampoo and have used them together about five times now. I have long, thick hair which I wear in a severe bun for work on a daily basis. I&#x27;m very concerned about damaging or breaking my hair for this reason and consistently seek out shampoo/conditioner sets that promise anti-breakage or restorative effects. These products are easily some of the best I&#x27;ve used. Both the shampoo and conditioner are incredibly thick and feel very rich. They smell great, and my hair both feels very smooth and strong and looks great- even after taking my hair down from a braided bun the day after washing, I can&#x27;t see any split ends. I usually don&#x27;t use any shampoos that are supposed to be &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; because my hair can get oily, but these products haven&#x27;t weighed my hair down at all. I&#x27;m thrilled with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with the shampoo from the same line for a week or two now.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dry and somewhat damaged from color treatment.  I find this product very easy to work through my hair; it rinses out cleanly without leaving residue.  It smells very similar to the shampoo, and the smell lingers for awhile, so it&#x27;s best to find out if you like this before using it!  (Try smelling it in a store before ordering.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shiny and soft when I use this.  I still get a bit of frizz, but I do think at least some of my frizz is tamed by using this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be safe for color-treated hair; I haven&#x27;t seen any fading even though I shampoo and condition every day.  I think this also helps a little with detangling, which is nice, since my hair is quite long and gets tangled easily.  Definitely glad I got a chance to try this one!</li>
    <li> The Monoi hair care system by Carol&#x27;s daughter is fantastic.  You literally see the difference after one use.  Don&#x27;t let the cost put you of, the benefit to your hair is well worth it.  I say this as someone who has bought shampoos and conditioners in all price ranges, without the promised results until Monoi.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is OK, nothing to brag about. It really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. The best thing that I do like about it is that it smells GREAT!, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have ever used. This works where many, many very pricey designer brands have not.  I am caucasian with thinning kinky, dry hair.  This conditioner really edges out the dryness without dulling or weighing it down.  Also good for managing fly-aways on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am picky about products, give this one a B+ and will definitely continue to use it.  The packaging however, rates a D-.  There is just no excuse for the poor packaging.  The dispensing lids don&#x27;t work well and the product is difficult to get out the container.  A first year student studying Packaging Science at RIT could do a better job of designing a user friendly dispensing system than the manufactures have done here.  The effectiveness of the conditioner makes it worth suffering through the packaging mechanics until they come up with a better system.</li>
    <li> This is great. My hair was falling out and just didn&#x27;t feel soft. After one use I could tell a difference. It really helps.</li>
    <li> This smells so great and have the hair so soft and manageable.  I would buy over and over again for these results.</li>
    <li> This is the best product line EVER! I have 3C hair type my son is 2C and it works wonders for us both. A little goes a long way so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last for a few months! Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product has a wonderful aroma and left my hair on my head instead of on the floor or in my comb.  I wish it was sold in a larger sized bottle!</li>
    <li> If you have fine, limp hair that tends to be dry and split easily you must buy this EXCELLENT product.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  Not too heavy - just perfect!</li>
    <li> Great for damaged hair</li>
    <li> Great product hair smells good and soft</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, it leaves my hair soft and moisturized without being heavy. I use another shampoo and condition with Carol&#x27;s Daughter conditioner and this works great for me.</li>
    <li> I have waist-length wavy-to-curly hair, and with hair this long breakage is an inevitable problem.  Anything that can help strengthen my hair is worth trying!  I was really pleased with Carol’s Daughter Monoi Conditioner (as used with the shampoo from the same product line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner has a light fragrance.  It didn’t really linger in my hair after I rinsed it out, which was really nice.  The conditioner isn’t so thick or greasy that it weighs the hair down, either.  It washes out very easily, but manages to leave enough moisture behind to make a difference in the hair’s texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was combing my hair after the shower, I was pleased by how soft and silky my hair felt.  As it air-dried, I was pleased to see that my hair wasn’t frizzing nearly as much as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve already added the conditioner and its matching shampoo to my shopping cart, to be purchased when my current supply runs out.  Carol’s Daughter Monoi Conditioner is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have really really dry half curly half straight blond hair. After using this product for a few months you can really tell that my hair has gotten a LOT longer.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this particular formula didn&#x27;t work well on my hair but I do use Carol&#x27;s Daughter products and have always been very satisfied with performance and they smell divine!</li>
    <li> This product delivers--after you&#x27;ve finally managed to get the bottle open. Nothing intuitive about the cap. Additionally, the shampoo and conditioner come in identical bottles with very hard to read labels when you&#x27;re in the shower without your glasses. I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if it came in a better package.</li>
    <li> While the conditioner went on smoothly and rinsed out well I found it comparable to what I already use on my clients</li>
    <li> My hair is shiner and I noticed less breakage, tangling and frizz with the first use. I used Wen prior to this and would recommend this product .</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, have to use a bit more that the suggested amount, but still a great value.</li>
    <li> The shampoo version is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, but the conditioner is just okay. It&#x27;s very difficult to get out of the bottle (my biggest complaint) and the smell isn&#x27;t as strong/amazing as the shampoo. Nevertheless, I do like it enough, and it&#x27;s an effective conditioner.</li>
