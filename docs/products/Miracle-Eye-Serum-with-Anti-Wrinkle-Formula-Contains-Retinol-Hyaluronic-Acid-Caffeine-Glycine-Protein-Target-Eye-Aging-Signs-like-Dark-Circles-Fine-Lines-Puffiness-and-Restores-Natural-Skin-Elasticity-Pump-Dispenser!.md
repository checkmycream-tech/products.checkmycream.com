      <li>What I DO have are some bags under my eyes and lots of fine wrinkles -</li>
      <li>I like the feel of the serum on my eye area, but after 3.5 weeks I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the wrinkles.  </li>

      <li>The cream really does help with the fine wrinkles and my under eye bags aren&#x27;t as pronounced.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the value.</li>
      <li>It is non greasy and is easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
      <li>I already use many products in th Nu Nutrients line, as I have sensitive skin, and Nu Nutrients didn&#x27;t cause any side effects or problems for skin.</li>
      <li>The Nu Eye Cream is supposed to be good for puffy eyes and dark eye circles.  </li>

      <li>It glides on smoothly and dries in a creamy texture, not dry or flaky.</li>
      <li>It even reduced the dark circles under my eyes and gave a fresh and energetic look to my eyes.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, the swelling and redness around my eyes has gone down significantly and the bags are no longer visible!</li>
      <li>I have 2 toddlers, so sleep is a luxury I am not afforded much of.</li>
      <li>I like that it is a gel and very cooling.</li>
      <li>It really worked too.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>After long time I tried  NuNutrients Eye Cream - Great for puffy eyes and dark eye circles which worked like a charm.</li>
      <li>In my work,  I am required to work many long nights and also early mornings.  </li>
      <li>This eye cream has eliminated the dark and puffiness under my eyes, giving me a more awake look and providing me with smoother under eye skin in the process.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>Not much sleep for moms, a moms work is never done, but at least I look good doing it!</li>

      <li>It takes care of those issues and makes it easier to apply makeup normally.  </li>
      <li>I just started a new job working nights</li>
      <li>This product helps with fine lines, bags and dark circles.</li>
      <li>I am a user of other NuNutrients products and so I gave this one a try and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I usually apply it on top of the renewal cream.  </li>
      <li>NuNutrients Eye Cream was actually the first product I tried</li>
      <li>Heck, I&#x27;d even go as far as to say that she has Benjamin Button syndrome and is aging backwards!</li>
      <li>When NuNutrients was introduced the first time, I was kind of skeptical because I had huge dark eyes and nothing really helped to cover them, but the results were instant.</li>
      <li>After a week of using this product the dark circles under eyes were significantly faded.</li>

    <li> Does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do! I use this after using the gel facial cleanser, and then the rejuvenating cream. It glides on smoothly and dries in a creamy texture, not dry or flaky. Like the other products, has a light and pleasant smell. Within a few days, I noticed that the bags under my eyes were less dark and the skin was more taut.</li>
    <li> Wow did my eyes need NuNutrients Eye Cream.  I think my poor wife was getting embarrassed by the way how my eye&#x27;s were looking.  I was avoiding pictures and just trying to think of a way to change the way my eyes were looking.  NuNutrients Eye Cream was actually the first product I tried and I&#x27;m happy I don&#x27;t have to try anything else.  My wife is the one who suggested I try this and I&#x27;m glad that I listened.</li>
    <li> Eh, I take care of my skin but I guess I was expecting more brightening and smoothing from this product. I like that it is a gel and very cooling. It is light and great under makeup. I got it as a preventative measure against wrinkles but I don&#x27;t think I researched the product enough. This product helps with fine lines, bags and dark circles.</li>
    <li> I just started a new job working nights and I am on the computer 24/7, so it is normal for me to have dark circles under my eyes in the morning. I&#x27;ve used this product a couple of times and have gotten compliments that I look &amp;#34;well rested and healthy&amp;#34;, so I will continue to use this priduct so that I do not go back to looking like a zombie from the walking dead. Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> I get puffy eyes when I don&#x27;t get enough rest, and this relieves them. A male friend tried it on his eyes and I saw a dramatic increase in just a couple of days. His get a lot worse than mine. It feels really good on my skin, like I&#x27;m not using anything else.</li>
    <li> If you are a person who suffers from dark circles around the eyes or puffiness, this is for you. This product will eliminate these problems, and leave you with a clear face. It works, try it!</li>
    <li> I love using this eye cream! I work long hours so when I wake up in the morning, my under eyes are always a little dark and puffy. After I started using this cream, I noticed that the puffiness and dark circles were non-existent! My eyes looked younger and more alert. People at work thought I was doing something different with my make-up when in reality I was wearing less make up because I didn&#x27;t have to try to cover up my sleepy looking eyes. I am so glad I started using this product and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> As a tired mom, it&#x27;s easy to get baggy or even puffy eyes due to lack of sleep, stress, etc.  It&#x27;s definitely no fun and causes one&#x27;s confidence in appearance to take a dive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NuNutrients has an eye cream that works great for puffy eyes.  Do you have dark circles?  No worries, it takes care of that too.  It&#x27;s your &amp;#34;Miracle Eye Serum.&amp;#34;  It takes care of those issues and makes it easier to apply makeup normally.  No more having to try and hide puffy eyes and dark circles with makeup.  Unfortunately, this can make it look worse and so noticeable.  Yay for NuNutrients Eye Serum!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 42 and my eye area was not too wrinkled to begin with.  I like the feel of the serum on my eye area, but after 3.5 weeks I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the wrinkles.  The bottle contains 1/2 an ounce of cream.  I was using Nutreogena Ageless Intensives Eye Cream ($10), also 1/2 ounce, prior and it seems to work the same for half the price.  After I finish this bottle, if I don&#x27;t see any improvement, I&#x27;ll go back to the Nutreogena.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long-less than a week - too little time to see any real results.  But I like the product and will hopefully notice some improvement after a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> After years of long hours at work, and sleepless nights with children, my yes have developed slightly dark circles. These can be very unappealing in a professional workplace and eventually i started feeling self conscious about it. This product was brought to my attention by my wife, as she as well uses it. I have seen tremendous results since using this product and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
    <li> Due to allergic infection in my eye it became puffy. The redness reduced in few days after treatment but my eyes remained puffy.It took over one month to recover from the infection and i was hesitant to try anything near my eyes. After long time I tried  NuNutrients Eye Cream - Great for puffy eyes and dark eye circles which worked like a charm. It suited my sensitive skin and the puffiness in eyes got reduced very soon. It even reduced the dark circles under my eyes and gave a fresh and energetic look to my eyes. The eye cream is suitable for all skin types. It will reduce the effect of puffy eyes and dark circles very early than you expect.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with puffy dark circles under my eyes my whole life and this is one product that I have found that really helps ease the puffiness and even helps brighten my dark spots. It gives me results I normally only get using a ton of concealer, which ends up drying out my face and making it worse! I love this eye treatment and recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I think genetically I&#x27;m prone to having puffy eyes, or maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I have been wearing glasses for most of my life and so when I wear contacts it seems like the bags under my eyes are extra noticeable. Whatever the reason, I&#x27;ve been self conscious about my eyes being puffy after my mom made a comment about it and have tried different eye creams to try to reduce the puffiness. I am a user of other NuNutrients products and so I gave this one a try and was not disappointed. It greatly reduces the bags and puffiness of my eyes. A little product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Nutrients Eye Cream can be used to tighten wrinkles around the eyes.  Often times, cigarette smokers develop wrinkles around the eyes.  NuNutrients Eye Cream is a great way to eliminate some of those wrinkles.  Priced just under $90.00, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
    <li> Some eye creams make my skin really tight and uncomfortable. I like NuNutrients because it is different. I goes on smooth, and even though it eliminates some of my fine lines and puffiness, the skin does NOT feel stretched or uncomfortable. I was a little nervous about investing the money at first since I had never found an eye cream I liked before. Needless to say I am really glad I purchased this product. NuNutrients is just a great brand; I have never been disappointed with any of their products. This is the one and only eye cream for me.</li>
    <li> I have 2 toddlers, so sleep is a luxury I am not afforded much of. So when I started seeing dark puffy circles under my eyes, I ordered this right away! I already use many products in th Nu Nutrients line, as I have sensitive skin, and Nu Nutrients didn&#x27;t cause any side effects or problems for skin. It has improved it! So when I find a brand that works for my skin I will use that brand for multiple needs. After 1 week and 3 days I am starting to see results. My circles have diminished significantly and my eyes are no longer puffy. I no longer have to smear concealer under my eyes just to leave the house or see my husband! Seriously when he was on his way home from work, I used to run to the the bathroom and cake on concealer under my eyes! I looked like the walking dead without it! But no more! I am once again fresh faced, bright eyed and ready to take on the day...and the night! Not much sleep for moms, a moms work is never done, but at least I look good doing it!</li>
    <li> My brother keeps vampire hours so his eyes looked like crap. I recommended he get something to make him no longer look like a basset hound and straighten his face up again. WHen I got him this, after a few weeks he noticed the difference and kept using it. Definitely worth the value.</li>
    <li> My mom and her best friend had puffy eyes and dark circles around their eyes. What did they used everyone asked? The nunutrients eye cream. It really worked too. You can see the puffy part went down and the dark circles faded. That&#x27;s wonderful for them. They are always flossing their beauty. Lol! Moms! You just have to love them.</li>
    <li> Genetically, I have puffy eyes and since I have been wearing glasses for most of my life and so when I wear contacts it seems like the bags under my eyes are extra noticeable. Whatever the reason, I&#x27;ve been self conscious about my eyes being puffy after my mom made a comment about it and have tried different eye creams to try to reduce the puffiness. I have seen tremendous results since using this product and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
    <li> I personally get puffy eyes and dark circles very often and I always look for a reliable puffy eyes product. I have tried some eye cream products from some American chain stores. They&#x27;re either not working or irritate my eyes. My sister ordered this online and she lend it to me just to try it to see if it works for me. It turns out great and I am happy with the result. I have no allergic reaction to this eye cream and it really lighten my dark circles. I might purchase one for my own soon.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients delivers again! I am a desk jockey, I stare at the computer for most of the day. In the morning my eyes are puffy, and tired looking with dark circles. This cream is awesome! The skin under my eyes doesn&#x27;t only look better, it feels better. I love how smooth it goes on, easy to apply. I recommend it to any one who wants to relieve those crows feet, circles and puffiness!</li>
    <li> My wife using this product in the morning and before going to bed. We were impressed how quickly we saw results! After two days, the puffiness under eyes were extremely reduced. After a week of using this product the dark circles under eyes were significantly faded. Initially, I thought this product great and will help many people. It is more effective than other products. Overall, I am very pleased of how quickly and effectively it worked!</li>
    <li> I like to use this product after putting cucumbers over my eyes or even used tea bags. It&#x27;s like a double whammy effect for my tired looking eyes. I don&#x27;t have puffy eyes per say but they get dull at the end of the day. Just put a tiny bit all around the eyes. I wake up the next morning looking more awake, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> The Nu Eye Cream is supposed to be good for puffy eyes and dark eye circles.  I don&#x27;t really have puffy eyes or dark eye circles.  What I DO have are some bags under my eyes and lots of fine wrinkles - no crows feet, though.  The cream really does help with the fine wrinkles and my under eye bags aren&#x27;t as pronounced.  Keep in mind that it&#x27;s eye cream - not a miracle cream.  When you apply it, it goes on smooth and there&#x27;s no tightening of the skin.  It feels good on - just dab gently around the eyes and then smooth it into the skin.  I usually apply it on top of the renewal cream.  Since the product is light and silky, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on your skin clogging up the pores.</li>

    <li> I work in front of the computer screens all day and I have developed dark eye circles. I wasn&#x27;t very confident with myself. I was trying to find something that works and covers them perfectly. When NuNutrients was introduced the first time, I was kind of skeptical because I had huge dark eyes and nothing really helped to cover them, but the results were instant. It is indeed a great product and everyone should try it.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I have lots of other NuNutrients products that I use and I love them all. This product is great for the puffiness under my eyes. Would Recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect product! from working and having to come come and do more work, i usually am worn out, but I definitely don&#x27;t want to look it. This eye cream has eliminated the dark and puffiness under my eyes, giving me a more awake look and providing me with smoother under eye skin in the process. I highly recommend this item. It is definitely a life saver!</li>
    <li> Due to my hectic work before computer, my eyes began to become puffy as well there are dark circles around my eyes. That is when, one of my friends recommended this product. There are many positive reviews about this product and I decided to give a try. I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to every one who are looking for the best supplement to reduce puffy eyes and dark circles. Great one!</li>
    <li> I have to wear glasses all day, every day, so sometimes my eyes do get puffy and my dark circles were getting to be a problem. I used it and it is definitely starting to help a little. I put it on my eyes before bed; that seems like when it will help the best. I&#x27;m impressed with the progress, and I know my puffy eyes won&#x27;t get worse!</li>
    <li> Once again I am writing a glowing review of a NuNutrients skin product. The eye cream claims to help dissipate dark circles and puffiness around the eyes, and it does exactly that. I have had dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember; I have terrible insomnia and the chronic lack of sleep has left its mark. I wasn&#x27;t naïve enough to think that the circles could go away completely, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much less noticeable they were after using the eye cream for just over a week. I look less tired, and I think the cream has also added a brightness and suppleness to the skin around my eyes. I wish I had taken before and after shots so that everyone else could see the difference too.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is fantastic.  In my work,  I am required to work many long nights and also early mornings.  This often makes my face appear puffy and tired looking, especially  under my eyes.  Being a fan of NuNutrients,  I am using this eye cream and it is working great.  I simply apply the cream, and after a few days I already saw results.  My eyes do not have bags under them and all the puffiness is reduced, giving my eyes a youthful, well rested and attractive look.  If you combine this product with other NuNutrients facial products and get enough rest, I guarantee you will have the nicest skin you have had in years.</li>
    <li> My wife has a few other products (facial cleansers, skin moisturizers) by this same brand. I overheard her and a few friends one day discussing what to do about puffy eyes. So I started Googling and found this eye cream. I immediately recognized the brand and placed an order without hesitation. A few applications later and I can already notice a significant difference. Her eyes are much less puffy. Heck, I&#x27;d even go as far as to say that she has Benjamin Button syndrome and is aging backwards! Pretty soon she&#x27;ll be a teenager again.</li>
    <li> In my adulthood, I have battled with dark circles and puffy eyes. The makeup I used was not enough to cover up the dark circles. I’ve tried numerous creams, but this eye cream seemed to work the best. It is non greasy and is easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
    <li> My neighbor recommended that I use NuNutrients Eye Cream.  I had not seen her in a few weeks.  She looks vibrant and younger from the cream.  So I started using it!  It is amazing! I look younger and no more black eyes.</li>
    <li> My fiancé and I are night owls; in our line of work we usually stay up pretty late, and additionally working part time jobs really pushes our sleep time away more than we would like. Lately I&#x27;ve been seeing my face starting to catch up with my bad sleep habits and needed something to clear away the bags under my eyes and get rid of some of the puffiness around them. Having used the NuNutrients product line in the past with success, I figured I would try the eye cream (I have to meet with some clients in a few days and needed something to make myself look presentable). Sure enough, the swelling and redness around my eyes has gone down significantly and the bags are no longer visible! I just apply the cream a couple times a day, and in just a few days I&#x27;m already seeing results! Definitely a good buy if you&#x27;re looking to help your face out and need a boost (also great for replenishing the vitamins in our skin that most of us seem to be deficient in).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t sleap well at all so I constantly have bags and puffiness. It doesn&#x27;t help that I have a toddler who wakes me up extra early. Anyways I needed a good product so I could walk around looking like something other than a sleap deprived zombie lol. I stumbled upon this and decided to give it a try. It worked amazing. Not only are the bags and puffiness gone but my eyes feel more awake, not dried out and hard to keep open. I love this and can&#x27;t wait to buy more and give some to family members and friends.</li>
