      <li>Was citrus, but on the warm side.</li>

      <li>Great price / fast shipping !!</li>
      <li>For most things, I don&#x27;t follow what is popular or trending but this cologne truly lives up to all the popularity and</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and Love using it.</li>
      <li>This is by far the Best Cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my life!!!</li>
      <li>I liked most about the fragrance</li>
      <li>This may smell good on someone else, but it smells like cheap cologne blended with orange peels on me.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this scent - it&#x27;s definitely a favorite, perhaps *the* favorite!</li>
      <li>Very smooth and not offensive.  </li>
      <li>My husband already wears this scent, and we both love it.  </li>
      <li>I have never ever before been asked by so many people, what are you wearing?</li>
      <li>ok...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to buy it in fragrance shop where you can test it, I know that it lasts for 5 days, because I tried it in the shop in Ukraine and the price was 100$ for 1.6 ounce</li>
      <li>The best present for my husband.</li>
      <li>I bought this about six months or so ago, and I&#x27;ve worn it maybe three times at the most.</li>
      <li>I dont know why, maybe testers in the shop are more concentrate.</li>
      <li>I think I am going to love it and treasure it.</li>
      <li>I believe that this product may not be authentic or has been tampered with.</li>
      <li>Still  not even sure how to pronounce &#x27;Hermes&#x27;.)  </li>
      <li>I was expecting so much more from Terre DHermes given the reviews.  </li>
      <li>love it....</li>
      <li>but I love to wear it as well</li>
      <li>Any of these is much better than this one.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this cologne.</li>
      <li>Like most people I don&#x27;t like buying cologne online because there are so many fakes sold on the internet.</li>
      <li>I simply love Terre d&#x27;Hermes.</li>
      <li>The longevity is an added bonus, it lasts longer than most colognes on me.</li>
      <li>Learnt an interesting fact abt it, that the leather like trace in the fragrance is owing to the brand that once made saddles - thats what sets this apart</li>
      <li>I too love the scent,woody and smoky, and oriental.</li>
      <li>and i love it...</li>
      <li>Surely it can&#x27;t be that different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(This order is my 4th in as many years.)</li>
      <li>this will probably get you your girl :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sexy and elegant, well-balanced and enticing.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t describe it exactly, but it&#x27;s pleasantly spicy and woodsy, yet not overpowering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend buying this for any man not afraid to stand out !!</li>
      <li>and I would get the pleasure of gentle wafts of the pleasant aroma all day.</li>
      <li>I LOVED the way I smelled, and more importantly, my very distinctive wife was overwhelmed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Based on the positive reviews and awards, this seemed like a good bet, so I took a gamble and ordered it &#x27;unsmelled.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the complexity and depth to it, and I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>Right now, with the colder temps this scent is in its own.</li>
      <li>So because this isn&#x27;t a scent that&#x27;s easily found in Macy&#x27;s</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow!! This is an amazing scent! Would make a great gift for the man in your life. Single men looking to date...this will probably get you your girl :)</li>
    <li> This cologne is exquisite and expensive. Caution: Amazon will not accept returns on cologne! I ordered the 6.7 oz size and determined that it was too large, but Amazon won&#x27;t accept returns on that item. I wish this has been fully disclosed more clearly by Amazon. This 1.6 oz size is perfect. Thanks Amazon, not.</li>
    <li> Fake product. There is no serial number at the bottom of the bottle. I have brought this to a store and the staff there told me it should have a serial number. And the fragrance lasts only ten minutes. Very disappointed at Amazon!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist went bonkers over this scent and couldn&#x27;t believe it was \\&quot;a man&#x27;s fragrance.\\&quot; It&#x27;s earthy with a slightly mineral-like edge that I find subtle and refreshing.</li>
    <li> hermes makes good scents. and this one doesnt dissapoint.give it a try and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with complements.</li>
    <li> I did all my research and was convinced that I had found my killer new scent for 2015. Ordered and was so excited for it to arrive, not so much when I put it on. If burnt wood and patchouli is your thing you might like this, if not...you won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in other reviews, cut out tags replaced by bar code. Not sure that matters, just confirming in case it does.</li>
    <li> Tried this out in the Hermes store, 3.4oz was going for well over $~130. However the single test spray i had lasted the entire day. Maybe it was the perfume and not toilette because mine doesn&#x27;t last as long. Either way, a great cologne to add to one&#x27;s collection.</li>
    <li> Typically I am not a scent person, and thus, most of my scents are so rarely used that I toss half full ones after a couple of years. However, Terre D&#x27;Hermes is the first scent that I actually finish within a year. (This order is my 4th in as many years.) I would describe the scent as rained-upon woods yet light, just the right amount of gravitas, with hint of citrus without being sweet. In my opinion (and climate), I feel that I can wear it year around and to any event: functions, office and leisure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the reviewed product is an \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; and not a \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;, I know that it will wear off in the afternoon, and needs reapplication for any evening function. I don&#x27;t mind - it&#x27;s the way \\&quot;eau de toilettes\\&quot; work - and I prefer it that way.</li>
    <li> It lasts only for 3 hours of so.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if Amazon has kept them for too long. Probably that&#x27;s why they have a discount. When I received the fragrance, there was dust on the bottle inside the paper box.&lt;br /&gt;But I am very pleased with the smell if it. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> this is the greatest smelling cologne on the market.  when i wear it i am asked at least once a day, &amp;#34;what is that cologne?&amp;#34;, by men  and women.  WARNING:  do not wear this if you want to blend in the background and go unnoticed, you will not..</li>
    <li> This bottle had hardly ANY scent to it, which may be because it was old.  I wouldn&#x27;t know.  After receiving this bottle and dousing myself with the fragrance, I went to my local mall and tried on the same scent.  What a difference!  The bottle that I purchased from Amazon was tossed in the trash can.</li>
    <li> The fragrance house itself is great, the product Amazon sent me was no good.&lt;br /&gt;The serial number was shaved off of the bottle and cut out from the bottom of the box, the bar code below the UPS on the box was cut out and replaced.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance itself smells like a watered down version of the real thing and lasts maybe 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I know Amazon would not sell poor product intentionally. Not sure if this is the same you would find with the 3rd party sellers.</li>
    <li> I have never ever before been asked by so many people, what are you wearing? It is very distinctive, elegant, refined, masculine, you get the picture. Once you smell it, you get hooked. The first time I smelled it, I had to ask the person, what are you wearing? I had to have it.</li>
    <li> Recieved my bottle just before going into a meeting for two hours. Figured what the hell. Great testing ground. Sandwiched between two very cute girls. Definitely recieved comments about how great it smelled. Goes on a little strong but then mellows out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend buying this for any man not afraid to stand out !!</li>
    <li> Great price / fast shipping !!</li>
    <li> One of my coworkers was wearing this, and I told him I \\&quot;had to ask\\&quot; what he was wearing. I promptly ordered it for my son, who is now enamored as well. (He just asked me to add it to his Christmas list for this year.) Incredible scent!</li>
    <li> Hard to imagine my fragrance shelf without this bottle at this point. Super versatile and memorable scent. A masterpiece of contemporary perfumery.</li>
    <li> The best present for my husband. Herm&amp;egrave;s is always Hermes. Perfect product. I always bye it. This  smell  make you feel extraordinary.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Always get compliments. Even the Spanish speaking lady at the Subway Shop complimented me in Spanish, so you know it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> Having received a sample of the parfum version, I was hooked. Just one spray and I would get the pleasure of gentle wafts of the pleasant aroma all day. I decided to get a bottle of this intoxicating juice, but to my shock the parfum was incredibly expensive. The toilette was much more reasonable, so I made a purchase. Surely it can&#x27;t be that different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is. Although it is unmistakably from the same family, the toilette is like the slightly uglier sibling. The perfect balance of aromas is gone, replaced with a slightly off, astringent quality. After spraying it once and not getting the same intensity, I sprayed a second time. Now it is about 3 hours later, and I don&#x27;t smell it at all! What happened to the longevity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I long for the parfum version, but can&#x27;t justify its price. Such is life.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my brother and he loves it,  The bottle was tough to open though and had a strange opening mechanism.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing. Lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Great smell citrus, patchouli, cedar and vetiver smell, great shipping thank you</li>
    <li> Got the Terre D&#x27;Hermes complete set as a complimentary toiletries when I stayed at the Burj al Arab. At first, I thought it was too strong and told my brother he could have it. Later that night, I used the Terre shampoo and shower gel and headed out for dinner (skipped the EDT since I thought it would murder the nostrils of my family). Come to my surprise, the scent mellowed down and lasted for a long time and I got compliments on it! Not on the flowery side of fragrance and very refined and sexy!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice citrusy, woodsy smell. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> My husband already wears this scent, and we both love it.  Very smooth and not offensive.  Be aware that the 1.6 Oz size is quite small, and he will be using this as a travel size.</li>
    <li> Took a stab at this based solely on the positive reviews. At first, I thought it smelled a little like a scented insecticide like &amp;#34;OFF&amp;#34; or something...But,it arrived same time as a $400 bottle of Aventus by Creed so it lost that contest...It&#x27;s growing on me. Heavy patchouli if you like that. Wife likes it and that says a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it a go.</li>
    <li> I was Christmas shopping in Nordstrom in the Men&#x27;s Fragrance section when up walks a mid age gentleman with his baby in the stroller. He excitedly yells to the baby, there&#x27;s that super fancy cologne your mother loves before he proceeds to Douse both himself and the baby in the cologne. Naturally after that I was curious and picked up a strip to do a spray test on and I loved it. I didn&#x27;t really care for the parfum but the EDT was heaven. Previously to finding the EDT I was carrying around a Bleu de Chanel gift set. I ended up finding a lovely EDT Set with the the $105 size bottle in it with alot of little extras. I gave the gift and he has already been getting compliments on it~!</li>
    <li> I was expecting so much more from Terre DHermes given the reviews.  It has a woody smell but it doesn&#x27;t smell like an expensive cologne.  I tend to like fresh smelling colognes like the Aqua Di Gio, Armani Black, Issey Miyake, Prada Infusion, Jean Paul Gaultier.  Any of these is much better than this one.  Its not long-lasting either.  May be it works for others but not for me, this was a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and Love using it. Thank you Amazon for providing an amazing service. Great service! Will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Had tried the fragrance at a store, that didn&#x27;t accept cards. This was it. Learnt an interesting fact abt it, that the leather like trace in the fragrance is owing to the brand that once made saddles - thats what sets this apart</li>
    <li> I like Hermes fragrances, high quality feeling.&lt;br /&gt;But one thing was disappointing: Scent is not lasting as long as expected.</li>
    <li> The opening is a STRONG blast of sweet, dirty oranges. After an hour, the orange is still very strong and spicy. This may smell good on someone else, but it smells like cheap cologne blended with orange peels on me. Test this one out before buying.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite cologne,and last all day long</li>
    <li> I believe that this product may not be authentic or has been tampered with. Other reviewers have stated that the serial numbers that are supposed to be on the bottom of the Hermes box have been removed with an exacto knife and a piece of white tape placed over it. The package is wrapped in cellophane, the bottle is still full and to my nose, has the same scent, but buyer beware. I have called Amazon and they are investigating and will possibly take action to remove this product if it is found to be not authentic.</li>
    <li> Its different but just ok. I will use it around town but if I was going on a first date I wouldnt use it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this men&#x27;s fragrance. I get tons of compliments on it. It was shared with me and now I will share it wth all of my friends. I only wear this cologne.</li>
    <li> Same as I wanted thank you</li>
    <li> I dont like the smell. Can&#x27;t really tell what it really smells A waste of time and money one of my worst</li>
    <li> Very good product The vender is very professional and the product is genuine. The bottle was package in his original box and well secure in bubble wrap went it arrive in the mail.</li>
    <li> Bought this fragrance for my significant other. Made the (common, maybe?) rookie mistake of reading its reviews AFTER purchasing. Although the serial number WAS cut out as previous reviewers have stated (bought directly from amazon.com) the quality was as I&#x27;d hoped: amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked most about the fragrance is how it &amp;#34;changes&amp;#34; after a few hours of applying. To me it smells of the earth&#x27;s natural scent during a rainfall on a sunny day and crisp, cut wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all.. my man absolutely LOVES it! A+++ for prompt delivery and meeting both our expectations!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the same signature scent for a while now, and I&#x27;ve been looking to branch out.  I tried a number of different fragrances, but most were either too &#x27;cool&#x27; for work (a lot of my patients are older), didn&#x27;t last too long, too young smelling etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that would be interesting and different, conservative, yet be a little out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the positive reviews and awards, this seemed like a good bet, so I took a gamble and ordered it &#x27;unsmelled.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this was a lucky find.  It is smokey, spicy and citrusy, all in a good way.  Another reviewer said it reminded him of a bonfire while peeling oranges (or something like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a rugged outdoors kind of vibe, says mature without saying boring, smells good without trying to show off.  For the professional setting I work in, with an older client base this sends all the right messages, although all that said women in their 30s like it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were 20 something, and trying to hit on chicks in a club, this would not be my first choice.  But for general use at work, this is great.  I enjoy the complexity and depth to it, and I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> I first saw this on an add in Conde Nast traveler, it had a pull back on the page so you could smell it. I liked it so ordered it on amazon . A little expensive but smelled good . When I received  the package it did not smell the same as in the magazine. although I do like it , it smells just like my Ralph Lauren polo cologne. It&#x27;s like polo in a different bottle. Hence the 3 stars</li>
    <li> This is not a shout it loud cologne, but definitely speaks of sophistication when you stop to consider the notes.</li>
    <li> exactly what was expected. feels much bigger than 1.6oz &amp; smell is same as perfume counter tester</li>
    <li> The scent is incredible! It has all these tones very well combined, and it&#x27;s not sweet (I don&#x27;t like sweet scents). I first tried this in an airport: I sprayed some on one of those paper sample thingies and as I was heading to my gate for my connecting flight I found myself sniffing it over and over. A few weeks later I tried it again in a store and I knew I had to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One piece of advice tho: GET THE Eau de Parfum! The EDT doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I gave this cologne to my partner for Christmas and he really lives it! And I love how it smells on him!</li>
    <li> Smells  extremely strange. Don&#x27;t blind buy this one.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!!!</li>
    <li> Delightful woodsy scent on my husband, without being OVERLY MANLY AND MUSKY, GRAWR I&#x27;M A MAN, SMELL MY SMELL.</li>
    <li> The Perfume is pure excellence&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not your ordinary  citrus, \\&quot;sport\\&quot; or fresh perfume.&lt;br /&gt;It is a perfume on its own liege.&lt;br /&gt;the scent takes me back home, when the tropical rain absorbers the dirt of the earth.&lt;br /&gt;Just think of you standing somewhere in the rainforest, in the middle of a field/hill, you feel the fresh rain pore down on you into the earth. You can smell the dirt, rain, rocks and trees aromas surround you. that TERRE in french for Earth after all.&lt;br /&gt;a  very Earthly Cologne.</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews on this scent, I thought it would be one of the best scents on the market. I don&#x27;t own this product but I did try it and I was terribly disappointed. So because this isn&#x27;t a scent that&#x27;s easily found in Macy&#x27;s I thought I&#x27;d post my review of what I thought of it. To me it smelled almost exactly like the original Polo Ralph Lauren (green bottle), which I also don&#x27;t care for. But it does have remarkable stay power--about two hours after spraying it on my arm I washed my arm and I can still smell the fragrance. If you&#x27;re a fan of the original Polo and you&#x27;re out then by all means give this a try.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance.My husband saw ad in magazine and mentioned it...something he seldom does...so I was off to the Mall...no dice...so go one Amazon...there it was, ordered it and with my &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; it was here in two days! GREAT! He really likes it...not too overpowering...really nice.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible cologne - the scent is woodsy, slightly musky and very long lasting. While I haven&#x27;t received any verbal compliments about it from anyone other than my wife I have noticed that, when I wear it, people seem to act friendlier. Coincidence? Maybe. This is one of the more expensive colognes I&#x27;ve purchased but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> Very distinctive fragrance! Pricey but worth it. Doesn&#x27;t overpower your senses either.</li>
    <li> It has been a long time since I ran across a scent of this caliber. This a scent for men, at home in the forest, the boardroom, a London club, the game or a black tie affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It opens with a strong, bitter orange and black pepper. Shortly the orange mellows and a burning pine pitch, fresh cedar, dry earth smell intermingles. Patchouli hovers around the edge of notice. It projects well, and has a clean approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is dry, dry, dry. Think of eating an orange by a caravan fire near the spice market in Marrakesh. I have had it a week and women of all ages have commented very positively on it. It lasts for a good 6+ hours on me. Right now, with the colder temps this scent is in its own. It may be too dry and spicy when the mercury soars, but I may be wrong. I took a blind gamble on this and it has paid off huge.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this scent - it&#x27;s definitely a favorite, perhaps *the* favorite! I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments wearing it. Plus, I don&#x27;t smell it on others often, which makes it somewhat unique. The smell is masculine - woody, a bit spicy, but nothing obtrusive. The longevity is an added bonus, it lasts longer than most colognes on me. I personally find the scent versatile enough to be a signature scent. It&#x27;s sexy and elegant, well-balanced and enticing. I simply love Terre d&#x27;Hermes.</li>
    <li> Was travelling with my wife, leaving the island of Oahu.  We walked through the \\&quot;international duty free\\&quot; area to kill time.  Went into a Hermes store, as we&#x27;d never been in one before  (Way too rich for our blood.  Still  not even sure how to pronounce &#x27;Hermes&#x27;.)  Saw they had a cologne (didn&#x27;t even know they DID cologne) and tried it.  That was it.  I LOVED the way I smelled, and more importantly, my very distinctive wife was overwhelmed.  She looked at me and said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t care how much it costs.  You HAVE to buy this.\\&quot;  Only, we weren&#x27;t travelling internationally, so they wouldn&#x27;t let me buy it there.  Worked out great, because it was cheaper here on Amazon! (unpaid endorsement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so funny to me is what I read in the other reviews.  One of the first things my wife said to me was when she purred:  \\&quot;You smell like a man.\\&quot;  (to which i said....wait.  so i HAVEN&#x27;T smelled like a man to date?  what the what?) But whatever.  This is the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Chemistry by Clinique, Bleu by Chanel, but this scent overhwelms both of those excellent products.  It&#x27;s not just the cedar tones; it&#x27;s got a pepper bite, and other layers.  I can&#x27;t stop trying to smell myself all day (and even put a little on at night to soothe me to sleep.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is an often overlooked yet crucial component to how we feel, and how we make others feel.  This one is a freaking homerun and has become my scent.  No. Doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT.  (Or don&#x27;t.  Leave it all for me.)</li>
    <li> My husband told me about this after complimenting a friend, and asking him what it was. He could only remember that it was Hermes, but based on his description and the reviews on Amazon I identified it as Terre D&#x27;Hermes. The price was very good compared to other sources, so I purchased it and hoped it was the right one. My husband was delighted with it and complimented me on my investigative technique, since his friend told him it was only available in France. I too love the scent,woody and smoky, and oriental. I think I could happily wear it too. It lasts throughout the day or evening but since this is now his favourite scent  (and mine too) I don&#x27;t think the bottle will last too long, so there will definitely be additional purchases.</li>
    <li> I hunted dome this fragrance after smelling a delicious man at a dinner party.  My boyfriend, who is a cologne hoarder, loves it!  It is a unique totally manly smell.</li>
    <li> This is nearly a perfect scent.  I didn&#x27;t like Hermes previous scents, but this is perfect.  It lasts and you can wear it anywhere.  It is woodsy yet citrusy.  Great in summer or winter and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Note: I purchased this fragrance from a department store, in person, so I can&#x27;t comment on this seller&#x27;s exact product - I am reviewing this scent in general. Be cautious about buying fragrances online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first apply this scent, it can seem as though you&#x27;ve been smacked in the face with a cedar plank – the cedar scent is that prominent and strong. Same with when you smell it on a paper strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when you apply this to your skin and give it about 15 minutes to mellow out - what a great scent! I can&#x27;t describe it exactly, but it&#x27;s pleasantly spicy and woodsy, yet not overpowering. It is an &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; scent, but definitely not &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; at all. It also lasts pretty well, since it has a higher oil content than many other similar colognes. I can still get a little whiff of it even at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all scents, test it out on your own skin, you never know how it will work with your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The perfum is good. The only bad point is that it is not &amp;#34;eau de parfum&amp;#34; but &amp;#34;eau de toilette&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend after smelling it on someone else. Wow, love the smell! My boyfriend has been very happy with this! Highly recommend !!!</li>
    <li> a friend of mine had this sent and i love it... i was very happy to get this in the mail. the price was a little much but it is good quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect function...&lt;br /&gt;Everything ok...&lt;br /&gt;I liked.. work perfect using at the neck and arms...&lt;br /&gt;The womens liked a lot... i lost the cout them after using this on...</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t review items I buy here on Amazon or any other place. Now for a cologne that I blindly bought I most say I&#x27;m not disappointed at all its not loud nor is sweet, more like a citrus manly note that thanks God my wife love as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this being it was reviewed as having citrus tones. Turned out to not like it, its a real mature smell. Not for everyday wear. Was citrus, but on the warm side.</li>
    <li> Love love love this cologne. I bought it for my husband but I love to wear it as well</li>
    <li> love it....my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This has been recommended to me by a friend and I can say it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;My Husband was very happy!</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t care for it much.  To me it smells like rotten oranges a little, but girls love it so I wear it.  Personally I prefer chanel allure homme sport, similar but better in my opinion</li>
    <li> This cologne has a woodsy and musky scent.  It smells great especially for older gentleman and is the reason that I bought it for my father.  He usually goes for lighter smells but had loved this scent as it is clean, woodsy, and lasts for hours.  I would definitely recommend it for older men as it is a more sophisticated scent.</li>
    <li> This is by far the Best Cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my life!!! I highly would recommend this cologne to all men!!!</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time. I am lucky I got real Terre D’Hermes. I bought directly from Amazon and it is fantastic cologne with unique smell. I like the smell every bit of it. It has been around since 2006 but is still very popular. It has citrus opening with spicy notes. Projection is good and longevity is long lasting. I go to departmental store and test it out before I buy any colognes or perfumes.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne in the world. For most things, I don&#x27;t follow what is popular or trending but this cologne truly lives up to all the popularity and timeless essence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rajat Dhameja&lt;br /&gt;Physician and Health Administration Executive&lt;br /&gt;Hermes Fan&lt;br /&gt;Healthcare Consultant</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better to buy it in fragrance shop where you can test it, I know that it lasts for 5 days, because I tried it in the shop in Ukraine and the price was 100$ for 1.6 ounce, thats why i decided to buy it from Amazon twice cheaper but this lasts only few hours. I dont know why, maybe testers in the shop are more concentrate.</li>
    <li> Very pine-woodsy smell. Very masculine. Scent is subtle yet lingers.</li>
    <li> Like most people I don&#x27;t like buying cologne online because there are so many fakes sold on the internet. However, when I saw that this item was shipped directly from Amazon I thought it must be legitimate. Well, since then my cologne has arrived and boy was I WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box comes wrapped in hard plastic like most new cologne, this made me believe it was new and un-opened, wrong again. They must have put it in this plastic themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bottom of the box, the serial numbers have been cut off, and this cut covered by a white sticker. Seeing this made me realize already something was up, why would Amazon do this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I open the box, and the INSIDE of the box is ripped. This obviously means that someone has already previously opened this box. This was all the proof I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you about the cologne itself as I didn&#x27;t spray it so that I can return this. I can&#x27;t believe amazon sent something like this to me.</li>
    <li> Bought this in Sept 13 but reviewed this only recently:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the outside, the bottle looks much less saturated, comparing to the same product bought from various Hermes boutiques around the world over the last few years. The original boutique bottle is always the same and is more yellow, where this product was simply faint. This might be due to different glass of the bottle or the liquid itself. Though, the reasons are not important. What is important is that this difference is absolutely obvious. Hermes (or any brand of their scale) would never allow departing from their standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is the same to me (not being a sommelier, I&#x27;ve been using the product from boutiques for a few years). Prior reviews pointed to the scent not lasting long, comparing to the original product. Again, not being a sommelier, cannot really judge this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle appears to bear some number (some prior reviewers claimed there was no serial on their bottles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is indicated as &amp;#34;Terre&amp;#34; (the link to which leads to a blank page) which is the name of this fragrance by Hermes - again, Hermes only sells their products under its head name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give:&lt;br /&gt;- below zero stars to both Amazon and Hermes (for not efficient counterfeit prevention measures), and&lt;br /&gt;- six stars to the &amp;#34;Terre&amp;#34; seller here, for being able to cheat all of us for such a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this about six months or so ago, and I&#x27;ve worn it maybe three times at the most. It smells exactly like the &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; scented public restroom air fresheners.</li>
    <li> Best smelling toilette sold</li>
    <li> It has a strong smell to hit your mucosa system:(</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this cologne is mild but masculine.Peopls ask me everywhere I go what is name of the cologne I am wearing.You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> My female friend was wearing this fragrance and I loved it - had to have it.  I was surprised when I learned that it wasn&#x27;t a unisex scent - it&#x27;s fresh, clean, and smells amazing on me.  -sb</li>
    <li> The scent lasts short and it smells different with my first one, furthermore, the the serial numbers is changed by a white sticker.</li>
    <li> Very good no complaints</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scent. Period.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even need to write an \\&quot;essay\\&quot; reviewing the product. The photos that I uploaded said it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a recent college graduate (not a geezer) and I the take the risk of purchasing this Hermes without visiting the mall to test it out because of the research I have done. Good reviews and video recommendation by many users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived this afternoon after I got off from school, and I tested it out. I think I am going to love it and treasure it. The scent might not last very long, but it is good enough for me and it feels like that I just went out from a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will use this one again after 5 years and abandon the cheap AXE from Walmart because whenever I smell the AXE  from a guy, I got so bored already. It feels elegant to wear Hermes, and at least it is more classy.</li>
