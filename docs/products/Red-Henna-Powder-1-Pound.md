<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This henna product produces a rich red/auburn color on medium brown hair. It mixes up easily to a smooth paste consistency The smell is much less than other hennas I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve been a henna redhead for 41 years. As a retired hairstylist I highly recommend this product. P.S. I just ordered another pound for a friend.</li>
    <li> There were no sticks or twigs, just a nice powder, perhaps a little gritty, but pretty nice.  My hair is naturally medium-dark brown with around 10% gray, and hangs to my collar bone.  I boiled 2 cups of water, took it off the burner, added 5 bags of black tea, and steeped for 4 hours.  Then I added 220 grams henna powder to a disposable plastic container (1/2 of this bag), stirred in the tea, covered, and let sit in our hot garage overnight for 12 hours until the dye released.  Then applied it to my hair, covered with Saran Wrap and a shower cap for 3 hours.  I rinsed it off outside with the hose and many handfuls of conditioner.  It turned out GREAT!  It&#x27;s very natural looking, and quite red.  I&#x27;m happy with it as is, but expect it to darken to a pretty auburn over the next week, which will be even better!.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year and I love it. The grinding is really good, feels like powder sugar!</li>
    <li> Works awesome for hair dye. I dye my wife&#x27;s hair who I would call a light brown-blonde. It turns her hair a nice natural reddish hue with very good color saturation. She was asked by her professional hair stylist who colors her hair, with compliments following. My dad, not knowing I had done the coloring, and is particular with women&#x27;s hair color, also spontaneously commented on the coloring, asking what/how she did it. The reason Henna is so spectacular is because it is a natural product, surprise it gives effortless natural color with natural gradations and a deep natural resonance. Artificial colors are flat, artificial, lifeless. To a sensitive eye, the difference between a natural color and a fake color is readily apparent. This is also completely non-toxic. It smells quite good in my opinion, like wheat grass juice with strong grassy notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not an expert hair dyer. I undertook this with my wife because I am cheap, and doing it for her myself turned out to be enjoyable with easy and excellent results. My formula is basically to mix some vinegar into the powder until it is a very thick mush. Then I pour boiling water into it until it flows similar to the consistency of somewhere between pudding and heavy creamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have added indigo (for black shade), crushed hibiscus (bright red), and clove (deep red/maroon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, I get many more uses out of this on my wife&#x27;s hair than a standard kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one con is there can be little bits of clumps/granules, and/or plant matter, especially when adding hibiscus or clove, but it washes out and does not effect the end-color or texture of the hair negatively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One great plus, it is a natural conditioner that leaves hair SILKY smooth for days. I believe it is due to the high levels of anti-oxidants in greens. In contrast artificial color tends to weaken hair, making it more brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
    <li> Gurs I was worried, but it comes out what I was expecting</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the product did now have color as mentioned. It may have been too old. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for anyone looking for color without the chemical additives.  Being a natural strawberry blonde, I use henna to make my hair color more vibrant. Mix with water and small ammount of olive oil. Let it set for 30 to 40 minutes. Rinse and condition. Use a fine tooth comb to get any henna left behind.&lt;br /&gt;I will be a regular customer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works well,better and brighter on some skin types. Fun to use</li>
    <li> This item shipped quickly and it was well packaged. I mixed the henna to dye my hair. It has a good dye release, however, I thought the mixture was gritty. I am a black woman with natural hair. I have hennaed my hair before but this was a very difficult mixture to wash out.</li>
    <li> I have been putting henna in my hair for years. This henna is incredibly gritty but it does the job. It never fades (don&#x27;t even bother bleaching it out) and is good, fresh quality. I add yogurt to mine to make it more of a paste so it doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> Always consistent beautiful color, this is the best red henna I have ever used and I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I mixed and let set over night for the color to release. I added a little indigo mix the next day and put on my hair. I sat under a heated dryer for over an hr and 1/2. I got a wonderful meduim brown with aubrn tint...the henna colored my hair just as it should have with added indigo and the powder was fine enough to rinse out easily. Well as easy as quality BAQ Henna can rinse out of your hair. I will continue to use this henna as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered and used this twice, and have had excellent results both times. I have hair that reaches my tailbone, and it takes the entire package to dye that much hair, so it&#x27;s also an excellent value. I used bottled lemon juice to mix with the powder, and I got very good dye release. The initial color comes out quite red, even on my dark brown hair, but rest assured it will oxidize to a much more subdued tone in about 3-5 days. This is my go-to for henna powder for my hair.</li>
    <li> We have a septic tank and also the last few years gray water our sinks and shower into french drains, so using harsh hair dyes has not been an option. When we moved here I had a couple of gray hairs and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but--cough-cough--I have developed many more in the last, high-mileage decade and I started looking for options. I have dark brown hair with auburn highlights, so henna seemed like a possibility. Thanks to the great reviews on here, I tried it. So happy I did. My grays are now light red &amp;#34;highlights.&amp;#34; My husband seems to really appreciate it and it&#x27;s easy on the gray water drains, so I&#x27;ll be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time, I tried the quick method of adding apple cider vinegar and henna powder to a pudding texture, then baking covered in the oven for 1 hour at about 170&#x27;. I only left it on for 2 hours, as it was so messy, but that seemed to work okay.  The second time, I combined the vinegar and henna and let it sit 12 hours, then left it on for 4 hours. I don&#x27;t know whether it was the repeated application or change in preparation, but the second time my hair seemed a lot healthier, shiner, and less frizzy ( have long hair, past my elbows). One tip I wish I&#x27;d followed the first time: wrap your head in a plastic bag and then use a towel to twist it into a turban over the top of that and tuck it in in the back. It really cuts down on the amount of leaks and mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder I got seemed quite fine. I&#x27;ve never done henna tattoos, so not sure if it&#x27;s adequate, but this seemed about the texture of flour or the usual for ground spices.</li>
    <li> This product had a good deal of sand in it. Another reviewer mentioned that it was gritty. This would be the reason.</li>
    <li> mixed indigo powder with henna powder (6 tablespoons of henna to 4 T indigo). mixture has a slight &amp;#34;grassy&amp;#34; smell (it is a plant, after all.) none of the burning sensation on the scalp that you get from commercial dyes, nor the chemical smell.  hair looks great. hair dyed to a rich brown with dark auburnish (my grey hair) streaks.  looks even better in the sun.  will be coloring my hair this way from now on. ditching the commercial/chemical dyes.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal! For a reasonable price, I was able to purchase a pound of henna powder. It arrived on time and in good condition. I particularly like the packaging because it&#x27;s resealable, which is great, and more convenient for storage.</li>
    <li> Nice fine consistent grind and fresh so it gave beautiful strong color. I will soon be buying more of this henna.</li>
    <li> The first time i ordered this henna I was in love, but the second time it was gritty and there wasnt much color deposit,  maybe I just got old powder but ill be waiting till next harvest before ordering again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for decades and this is a great basic henna.  I mix several colors/brands to get the color I want...</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom, she loved it .. i have no complains. Arrive on time :)</li>
    <li> This henna works great for making my hair red without being permanent. My hair was already a little red, but this makes it much redder. It looks like a natural red. I got the big bag because it is cheaper. I just mix it with water until it is about the consistency of pancake batter. I then cover my hair with it and pin it up. I leave it in for about 2 hours and then wash it out with just water. No shampoo for a few days because that will wash it out. I do use plenty of conditioner on my hair after washing the henna out. It works well, but is very grainy, messy and takes quite a while to wash out.</li>
    <li> Red Henna Powder is an excellent  product for dying hair naturally. I mix henna with indigo leaves to make the color darker. Seller shipped the order promptly.</li>
    <li> It is almost NOT colouring the hair! Pour colour!</li>
    <li> When I bought it I thought I was getting red henna but the color shows up an orangish brown and you have to apply it multiple times to make it dark.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping I thought it would take long . The power seemed fresh smelled natural would definitely buy again. I got this for many different things seeing as henna can be used differently and I personally like to save money and buy bulk and quality.&lt;br /&gt;I use for henna hand and foot design and hair treatment just to name a few&lt;br /&gt;Just store in cool dry place till ready to use</li>
    <li> Very grainy but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I use henna every couple of months on my hair. I mix this stuff up with an egg and some lemon juice, let it sit for at least 12 hours (I&#x27;m gonna try balsamic and apple cider vinegar too) and leave it on for 2-6 hours wrapped in clear wrap plastic. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna on my hair for about 5 years and this is the worst I&#x27;ve used yet. I usually get good color deposit after 3 hours, but I slept with this on my hair and only get a pinkish yellow color. It is very gritty and difficult to work with</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed .First when I opened the package the smell is not henna some sort if green herb.,and i have been using henna for more than 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;The origin on my package is EGYPT . I was sad to know that when I received it but tried to give it a chance . I mixed it with lemon juice it took more than 18 hours for dye release , and still the smell is weird. Now  I am afraid to try it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came to submit my review I found that it origin should be from Pakistan . I know something is fishy EGYPT is not a source for Henna and if so it is terrible , I am an Egyptian ....</li>
    <li> Graduation gift for my daughter as she heads off to college. I figured she could make a few bucks doing henna.</li>
    <li> Grittier than other hennas I&#x27;ve tried but with really potent dying power.</li>
    <li> The henna is very fine but has sand in it. There doesn&#x27;t appear to be any green dye in it but the color it leaves is a bit dull. It actually seemed to darken my hair. I will finish the rest of the packet of henna but I will have to look for another henna supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 9/29/14:&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave this henna 4 stars but after using it again it deserves less 0 stars! I applied some henna to my hair the second time I used this and left some in a container to use another day during the week. When I came back to use it again later that week, I noticed the henna was BLACK. I applied some to the back of my hand and rinsed it off and there was black dye on my hand. Every time I had used this henna, my hair became brittle and dry. My hair does become somewhat dry after using henna, but bounces back to its usual shine. My hair has not returned to its normal condition and no matter what I do, it stays dry. I have tried multiple oil masks, deep conditioners and even trimmed off a few inches. I regret ever buying this product because it has ruined my hair. My mom and I have been using henna for many years now and the best one we&#x27;ve ever used is usually of Indian origins. Beware of this product.</li>
    <li> Basically, I Got THis One To Make A Conditioner For My Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Have Allergies, Chemical Sensitivities And Have To Go All Natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There IS Another Henna I Use To Dye And Color My Hair.  I Believe I Have Used This One For That In The Past.  I Think It Came In A Different Container.  I Could Be Wrong.  I Will Ba Back To Comment, If It Is Not The Henna I Was Thinking It Was.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple different brands of henna. I have to dye my roots about every 6 weeks, depending on hair growth. I normally prepare my henna by adding lemon juice and water to it in a bowl with some pumpkin pie spice to make the smell more pleasant. I then cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm dark place for at least 12 hours. I must say this brand of henna has AMAZING dye release. My hair is beautiful! The only downside is it is very, very, very gritty. I&#x27;ve never had henna so gritty before. I guess this stuff just isn&#x27;t ground as finely as other ones. At first I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t dye my hair, or I wondered whether there was actual sand in it. Since I get such amazing dye release from this product, (and up close inspection), I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it isn&#x27;t sand. The particle are just henna not ground as finely as the rest. It does seem to take longer to get out of my hair. I also have VERY thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I would recommend this product. The amazing dye release makes it worth the grit.</li>
    <li> This created a nice long lasting stain (with the appropriate mixing techniques, of course). The price is unbeatable. However, make sure to sift carefully before mixing.</li>
    <li> This Henna Powder is prefect for the wanna be gingers of the world. it is super messy, but thats to be expected. i mix mine with vinegar, apple juice, black tea, fresh lime and lemon juice. then i mix it really good and put it in a big plastic bag with a square of white paper gently sitting on top of the mix, when it is developed the square will bleed through with orange (i leave it on with saran rap all night). the smell is amazing and lasts for months. i usually dye once a month and maintain with beet powder/cocoa powder/black walnut hull powder mix to keep the hues in check. my hair was pretty much dead before i started using this product and the color lack luster, not its bouncy and vibrant my curls are defined and i look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought it to make my hair healthier. I am a brunette, and henna doesn&#x27;t make them red. Hair became shiny and thicker. It is natural. Came on time</li>
    <li> This henna had brilliant color, but was far too chunky to pass threw the henna cone for my Mehndi designs.</li>
    <li> This henna is a very bright green, not like other henna that is older and brown when it comes in a clear plastic bag.  This is baq and it is in a foil sealed bag for freshness.  I used it as a gloss at first on my blonde hair to make it a strawberry blonde, but lately I have been using it full strength for about one hour on my hair and it comes out very fiery copper.  I would hate it if my hair turned a cherry cola red or burgundy, so I stick with Pakistani or Jamila henna.  This henna is very cheap for the amount you receive and has fast dye release.  I mix a tiny bit of conditioner in with my mix to make it easy to wash out.  I use about 1/2 the bag for my mid-back length very thick 3c hair.</li>
    <li> I was quite happy with this henna. It&#x27;s  big bag for a good price, so I&#x27;ll be able to do several generous applications. My hair  is medium brown naturally, as expected the henna changed my hair to a warm chestnut color, and my greys look like highlights. As always the condition of my hair is substantially better after the henna application, it feels both softer and stronger at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other reviewers have found it course. I didn&#x27;t find it different to henna I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere. Maybe they were new to using henna on their hair. Henna doesn&#x27;t seem to dissolve when you mix it with water, so you are going to have to wash a lot of sticky little grains out of your hair. I have very straight caucasian hair, and it&#x27;s shoulder length I find that shampooing about 3 times gets everything out. If you have very long hair, or natural afro hair it&#x27;s going to take longer.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this product is that it&#x27;s not packaged very well. The bag opened slightly during shipping, so there was henna powder on the books that were in the box with it.</li>
    <li> This Henna powder is very coarse and very poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it to color my hair, it barely colored it at all, using the same method I&#x27;ve used successfully with other henna.&lt;br /&gt;So the next time, I left it for 3 days to ensure the dye got released. I left it in my hair for 5 hours, periodically applying heat and it barely colored anything. So the very next day, I heated it (double boiler) the remainder of my batch that had set for 3 days and blended it with my stick blender to make it finer.  I put this in my hair for 4 hours, finally I got a LITTLE bit of color to transfer to my hair, but barely.  All it really did was waste my time and the money I spent on it.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The powder was almost neon green. This picture is accurate of the color. A high indicator of additives. I use it for my hair. I would not recommend using commercially for mehendi, very coarse. For the price, I thought I&#x27;d try it. Will keep looking for a source of henna.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I get about about 5 uses out of one bag. U can use for color or just as a hair repair. U can mix with coffee ,tea or food coloring to change color. And the color never fades out of the hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. A little gritty, but a very nice reddish color when done in hair.</li>
    <li> still experimenting with this henna but so far I am getting the hang of it.</li>
    <li> This henna was very very gritty, like it was mixed with sand. I noticed that as soon as I opened the package. I figured I would give it a try anyways and mixed some up. I left it in the sun for a couple of hours, and even left a small amount out overnight, and I did not get any dye release whatsoever. I applied some anyway to see what would happen, and I was not surprised when nothing happened at all. No color at all.</li>
    <li> I read the instructions on the package more carefully...It says to STEEP the henna for 3 hours, and leave on for 3 hours..I never steeped it before...Works better...and I had gray to cover, which is difficult..But did a good job...</li>
    <li> Yeah it is really gritty. And my color washed out within about two weeks (and I&#x27;ve been dyeing for YEARS). That is super short, usually I can keep a color for over a month sometimes two. Not too happy, probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Came fast, looks good. The powder though got on the other product that was shipped in the same packade. They have to think about that again next time thry pack two items. It shouldn&#x27;t be a problem as second item i can just rinse, but hanna colors especially if wet.</li>
    <li> It will redden your hair for sure. It does make it a little more orange/copper than a deep read. I am a dirty strawberry blonde and it gave me a great sutle red head look for cheap and works great with cassia obovata to rejeuvinate your hair</li>
    <li> This gave me a gorgeous, long-lasting, brilliant red.  I highly recommend this particular henna powder.  Quick dye release and great color.</li>
    <li> This henna is VERY gritty, someone else said that it as if there were sand it it, this is true. Sifting does nothing. There are also small plant fibres still visible. I was in a bind and needed this to use for henna tattoos so I sifted it, made my mix (lemon juice,a little essential oil, etc) and I portioned small bits of it out into a mortar and ground it smooth with a pestle. That worked great and it prevented the henna from clogging my bottles. It yeilds a great color in a quick amount of time. I was very happy with the product for the price but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> As others have said, there is definitely silica in it. Even so, it still works pretty well, and you don&#x27;t have to use as much. Just extra rinse.</li>
    <li> Left an orange stain on my hand from tattooing. I used it on the inside of my palm, and left it on over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the outside of the palm, it barely stained at all.</li>
    <li> from the color and shape of pieces inside the henna, I would say it has sand in it. I don&#x27;t think that is normal. Otherwise, the overall color and smell is ok.</li>
    <li> I have used a different Henna powder from another company and it seemed to give me a richer color.  I don&#x27;t really see the color but this henna made my hair shine.</li>
    <li> After using a more expensive pure henna powder, I thought I&#x27;d take a risk on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used warm (not boiling) apple cider vinegar as my liquid.  The acid takes longer for dye release, but lasts longer as a stain.  After about 6 hours, I had dye release.  I added ginger and cloves to cut the scent of henna (which I hate) after the dye release, covered my hair with the henna paste, wrapped it in plastic hair-covers and a towel and let it sit for about 5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When washing it out, I found that it was a fair amount grittier than the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems, but I think it might be an issue for people with extremely curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, the day after I used the henna, my hair is a lovely red shade- It&#x27;s not as bright as I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.  This was actually good, because it means that it looks natural right away, rather than having the color mellow in a few days&#x27; time.  Time will tell whether it oxidizes to a darker color than I&#x27;m used to.  I will update this review in a week or so with how the color is settling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update one week later:  The color mellowed as expected and looks like a very natural auburn over my brown hair.  I did wind up adding about a teaspoon of cloves to my shampoo for a couple of days to make sure the henna scent was totally gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 months later:  The color has faded a bit, but it blends well, so my roots are not obvious.  Will be coloring my hair again with this henna this weekend.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I used henna and I thought the product was pretty good.  It wasn&#x27;t gritty when I mixed it and I used lemon juice to do so.  It didn&#x27;t turn all of my hair red just the tips which had been a lighter caramel color.  Then again I hadn&#x27;t let it sit as long as I should have.  I waited about 2 1/2 hours then put it in my hair.  Overall, it did make my hair pretty soft but it was DEFINETELY a pain washing out.  I washed my hair about 3 times and there was still more henna left in.  So there was still a bit left when I began to style my hair.  I have curly 4b hair by the way.</li>
    <li> The product does not change my hair color and the henna smell remains for about 2 weeks in my hair even though I washed it several times.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that the color was especially strong, even with two applications--however, I was using it on dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> Chunky even after I was sifted it</li>
    <li> This Red Henna Powder quality is rough, dye is not entirely attach to the hair and out of the expectation</li>
    <li> This is more like an artificial hair dye, not henna, I would not recommend this product, it doesn&#x27;t even have the typical henna smell.</li>
    <li> It was way too grainy.  This would be great for hair as it stained well but not for mendhi.</li>
    <li> I put it on my hair and let it stayed over the night. My gray hairs seemed covered. But it didn&#x27;t go on my black hair at all. When I washed my hair, no reddish water came off my hair. I doubt if the color is red? I want to return it.</li>
    <li> Ive only used henna for my tattoos, but I bought this henna for coloring my hair for the first time. It came in the mail about for days earlier than expected. Other reviewers said their henna was gritty so I was surprised with the flour like consistancy of the henna I recieved. There were a few particles of sand but that was it. I guess I just got lucky. It gave my dark brown hair a reddish tone in the sulight and made it soft and frizz free. It did its work like it was supposed to and I have leftovers for more hair treatments. Im also gonna use it for my mehndi as well. The resealable bag was also a plus. This was so great for the price. I will happily order this again. :)    Update: used it for mehndi. Left an orange stain that lasted only a week and grains of sand clogged up my cones occasionaly. Recommended for hair use only.</li>
    <li> Probably won&#x27;t order this one again, it did not produce as bright of a red color as other hennas I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I found this henna to be very gritty, full of stems and difficult use. It&#x27;s as if it has sand in it...I tried sifting the henna, but to no avail. The dye release was not great...I left a simple henna mix on my hair for three hours-no change in color. This is after it sat covered at room temperature for several hours (to facilitate dye release). I&#x27;ve used henna for several years, and have never had this poor a result. I will not be using this particular henna again.</li>
    <li> Just as expected.  Perfectly matches my natural hair color and covers the gray. I love this stuff, conditions my hair rather than striping it as chemical dyes do.</li>
    <li> This is the worst henna I&#x27;ve ever used. It was super gritty and sandy and would&#x27;t even stick to my hair! It just fell off in clumps all over the floor. I got barely any color from this because it wouldn&#x27;t stick, but even when I tested it when it was done oxidizing in the bowl it barely left any stain. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with the good reviews. This is cheap crap and makes me never want to buy any of their products.</li>
    <li> It makes hair look very healthy.. and is good for adding color. The one bad thing is that it has a bad odor for awhile because of all the herbs. But other than that its amazing!</li>
    <li> As noted, the product was very gritty. Having expected that, I have no complaints, I bought it to dye my hair and it did! I would recommend it and get it again.</li>
    <li> This is my first henna experience, so I do not have any comparison to other henna products. Color release was good. I have natural soft black hair. Henna turned my gray hair into a glowing red color, but did not change the color of my black hair. It generally made my hair soft and shiny. The smell would stay for a few days, but it did not bother me. I simply mixed the henna powder with lemon juice, and kept it at a warm place (burner room) for about 24 hours. When the green color of the henna paste turned to brown, I used it to cover my whole hair. It was gritty but not as difficult to remove from my hair as I expected. I washed twice with a conditioner, and rinsed with water. I definitely would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This henna is great for body art and hair!&lt;br /&gt;For body art I sifted the powder, then added some white wine, soursop juice and tea tree oil (to &amp;#34;terp&amp;#34; it). Let it sit for approx. 7 hours for dye release, then applied the paste. Afterwards I wrapped the design with medical tape, followed by plastic wrap, steamed it lightly, and left on overnight. The stain came out a dark bronze/red, which settled to a beautiful (still dark) red/brown in a couple of days. Overall, the quality was great; very excited to have purchased this product. I have a medium complexion that&#x27;s often hard to stain noticeably, but this henna works very well!&lt;br /&gt;For hair I used the thicker henna left over after sifting, with a combination of lemon juice and tea (tea was a bad idea, too much caffeine). Let the paste sit for about 6 hours, then applied, wrapped my hair in plastic wrap plus a towel, and took a 3 hour nap. Followed it up with indigo powder for another 3 hours, and my hair is healthier, shinier, and all my pesky sun damage and chemical color is covered with a rich black.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I used this with my cousins and we had a blast. Make sure to use something to make it &#x27;pop&#x27; like tea, lemon juice or coffee, on it&#x27;s own the color isn&#x27;t as dark.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The henna mixes up well and goes on easy. The finished color is always gorgeous. I love the red of henna.</li>
    <li> I have been using this powder in my natural hair dye mixture for two years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I mix this with lemon juice and use it to henna my hair and it turns out wonderful. Smells like hay.</li>
    <li> I used it for hair dye&lt;br /&gt;successfully colors hair red in 3 hrs&lt;br /&gt;mixed with citric acid, sugar, and water&lt;br /&gt;came quickly and was finely ground</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this henna for my gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;I need to use tea instead of water when I make henna past though, it&#x27;s works well.</li>
    <li> Good, fresh henna powder.  For best hair coloring results, I definitely recommend mixing in hot water and lemon juice and letting the mixture sit for several hours or overnight to maximize the coloring effect.  I got very nice results and I have medium-length, very thick locks.  I didnt start with 1 solid, consistent color so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a uniform end result.  My grey areas are a nice red auburn and the rest of my brown hair has varying degrees of reddish-brown highlights.</li>
    <li> The henna would probably be fine if it was not full of sand. For a few days after I apply this stuff to my hair I have gritty sand that is hard to get out. Even sifting this through a flour sifter did not really help. I guess you get about what you paid for, and the only reason I got this was that Hannah Natural was out of stock. If you do risk this product, be sure to rinse as thoroughly as you can.</li>
    <li> Not really &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; more of a brown</li>
    <li> I was in a hurry.... so I ordered this without reading the reviews.  If I had, I would have taken their advice and ordered Jamilla.  The powder is lumpy and full of small sticks and other debris which clogs applicators.  Infuriating!  AND.. after all the time and frustration of cleaning out the tips, the henna resulted in a weak, pale colored tattoo.  If the quality of the henna was sufficient I would sift and strain it, but that would be much more work than it is worth.  Save your money.  Jamilla works the best!</li>
    <li> I used this henna to color mine, and a friends hair. It gave a beautiful auburn color to our hair. I have light med brown hair and my friend has med brown. It truned out even more beautiful than I thought it would. I am buying more today to do it again. It has strengthened my baby fine hair, and given it beautiful shine. The time and mess from coloring my hair without chemicals is more than worth it!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. I use it as part of a two-step process (henna, then indigo) for naturally dying my hair black. The color holds well and as a bonus it improves the health of my hair, making it smoother and shinier.</li>
    <li> Pretty sandy, but for the price its a good powder to practice with. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend professionally, but great for practice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to agree with other reviewers in that this henna is very well packaged, it arrived quickly, and it has decent dye release.  However, because I have ethnic hair (read curly, spirally, bushy, wavy, etc), I found it very difficult to rinse out compared to other hennas I have used.  With that being said, there&#x27;s nowhere in the description that indicates that it&#x27;s a body art quality henna, so I can&#x27;t knock it too badly.  Overall, it was a good price, the product is definitely useable and leaves my hair soft, but the grittiness was a little off-putting.</li>
    <li> First time using Henna powder. I bought it to dye my hair, but I haven&#x27;t worked up the courage yet. Used it in a hair mask instead. It does leave green flecks that fall everywhere when I brushed my wet hair. So it&#x27;s a bit grainy. But I haven&#x27;t noticed anything since my hair has dried. But it wasn&#x27;t expensive, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> I used to get the henna bar from Lush.com and I decided to try this one because it was much cheaper. I found out this is cheaper because it is VERY messy. The powder gets absolutely everywhere, and even though it is easy to mix/measure, it didn&#x27;t turn my hair like Lush&#x27;s did. I would recommend if you&#x27;re using it for hair henna, don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Bought this once before and it was okay, but the second time around was awful. I have been buying and using henna long enough to know the difference between pure henna and something with additives in it. Initially, I noticed that something was off with the smell. And when I made the paste, it was gritty and clumpy and sandy (to no fault of my own, I have made countless pastes before). It would not stick to hair or skin, it would just clump and fall off. It left no stain at all. Very disappointed!</li>
