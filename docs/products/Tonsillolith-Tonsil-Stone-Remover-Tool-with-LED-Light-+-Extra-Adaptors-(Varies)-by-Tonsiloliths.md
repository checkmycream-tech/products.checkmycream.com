      <li>This tool is awesome for removing tonsil stones.</li>
      <li>This tool is the greatest!</li>
      <li>It works great !!!!</li>
      <li>its good!!</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>A tip to using it is ensure you do not have a very bright room or lights in your eyes</li>
      <li>Great idea</li>
      <li>Works great just wish it came with another tip.</li>
      <li>Awesome product - very easy to remove tonsil stones.</li>
      <li>Aside from wishing the top screwed onto the handle, this device is great!</li>
      <li>not a lot of options out there; this was a good product</li>
      <li>Her breath smell good now.....</li>
      <li>The light is a great idea!</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t seem to be of good quality.</li>
      <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
      <li>I use it for the light and that is great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad this exists...</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, FINALLY!!</li>
      <li>Ok, so . .</li>
      <li>I bought this for my friend and She love it</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and great product.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;s kind currently available?  </li>
      <li>in all, it works better than any tool I have tried, and would still recommend it with caution.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel safe holding the thing</li>
      <li>, have tonsil stones, which are horrendously yucky, this tool is super handy.  </li>
      <li>To clean the back of the throat and the tonsils, this would have been a magnificent product</li>
      <li>The seller has re-purposed and re-titled a cheap ear wax remover, made in China, and more than quadrupled the price.  </li>
      <li>and it broke easily.</li>
      <li>Good idea but charged too much for this flimsy cheaply made product.</li>
      <li>Although, if you are gentle, it can be effective.</li>
      <li>The tool is smooth, so no scratching yourself.  </li>
      <li>Just to have the light feature is a plus in my book.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>also used the cheap led lit dental mirrors that came with the dental tools.</li>
      <li>Anything is better then using a q-tip right?</li>
      <li>Use a plastic syringe in one hand and a nice bright LED flashlight in the other.</li>
      <li>Built in light works great - allows other hand to become free to help with process or dangle around..</li>
      <li>Love it so much that I brought one for my daughter.</li>
      <li>the only thing the light on this remover does best is give you a extra hand.</li>
      <li>The light goes right where you’re working—</li>
      <li>- they were quick and helpful to replace one tool when it arrived damaged in transit.</li>
      <li>At first it seemed flimsy but the lite weight and built-in light helped a lot.</li>
      <li>Overall the concept is very appealing.</li>
      <li>One important thing i want to warn you about is that it may be possible to cause more tissue damage to your tonsils by using this too much, if that happens you may develop more tonsil stones from the increased damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>light really helps removal</li>
      <li>The person who make this object, you are on the right track.</li>
      <li>Great little tool!</li>
      <li>Even if it wasn&#x27;t the only one this is made decent and designed nicely for it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
      <li>After you get over the initial shock of the cost of the item and the fact that the quality is just ok, you will realize that it works as described.</li>
      <li>Such a cheaply made plastic tool did the job in one shot!  </li>
      <li>The light is so dim I couldn&#x27;t see anything.</li>
      <li>problem is the tips can easily come off if not careful use is not taken.</li>
      <li>Repeat daily and enjoy fresh breath and comfort.</li>
      <li>Removed a large stone the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Allows you to really see in your tonsil crypts.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the real way to get rid of tonsil stones:</li>
      <li>This makes the whole procedure much easier.  </li>
      <li>i noticed it was a bit sharp on the ends which could have been done better, such as given a smooth rubber like tip that had been hardened but can&#x27;t have everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t even bother taking it out of its original packaging which has Chinese written all over it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get this, based on other reviews.</li>
      <li>Then gargle it around (make sure not to swallow it) then spit it out to help kill the germs and heal the tonsil tissue that may get damaged by using a sharp tool to stick into it.</li>
      <li>A creative little gadget that probably doesn&#x27;t cost much to make, but the design is what counts in this case.</li>
      <li>How did I ever live without this?!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Oh,</li>
      <li>My one suggestion for improvement is that the top part of the tool pops off with too little force.</li>
      <li>It looks like a stick with a little loop on the end and works 10 times better.</li>
      <li>This tool is kind of hard to use.</li>
      <li>I used the metal dental tools to lift the skin out of the way and used the mirror to push the stone out, but with normal breathing the mirror would get fogged up and seeing the stone became</li>
      <li>I removed a star for this since this could potentially choke someone with a strong enough reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>How did I live without this?  </li>
      <li>Now if only I just didn&#x27;t get tonsil stones in the first place</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something fishy about this item, there&#x27;s an Ear tool that looks exactly the same for $1.88&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was looking for one tool that would enable me to look for and remove any tonsil stone, but it&#x27;s back to my pen light and long stemmed q-tips!</li>
      <li>let alone putting it near my mouth.</li>
      <li>My 12 year old daughter has had a tonsil stone lodged for weeks.</li>
      <li>You can find the EXACT SAME TOOL listed under ear wax remover for a tiny fraction of this cost.</li>
      <li>Before this I was using jetted water picks (never above the lowest setting), while good for reaching deep behind the skin flap, the pulsing action</li>
      <li>I recommend getting a small hands free mirror to use while using this tool.</li>
      <li>then i thought which for me makes it a little difficult to use, the light does help a bit but not as much as a flash light,</li>
      <li>Far too short of a device</li>
      <li>I found it kind of difficult to use since it has a tendency to make the tonsil to bleed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another tip, you can use hydrogen peroxide mixed with half a cup of water, only put about 1 cap full of 3% peroxide into the 1/4th cup of water.</li>
      <li>I have had a few days to try it out, the first time trying it</li>

<li> I wish it were slightly longer to reach a little further back.</li>
<li> Please make it a little longer and also had a smaller piece.  </li>
<li> and I am happy because now I do not have to smell her bad breath my GOD !!!  </li>
<li> I lean over the vanity trying to use the bathroom mirror, and sometimes I get frustrated not being able to get a closer look at what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br</li>
<li> It provides clear illumination and since the tip is narrow, it really provides great smooth control so you can evacuate those nasty nasty stones.  </li>
<li> this works, for years I&#x27;ve used a q tip it always hurt but got the job done, this takes less time and not nearly the pain.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have big or frequent tonsil stones, and they are hidden behind a flap of skin.</li>
<li> Look at it this way, waaaay cheaper then a constant dentist visit to clean out your tonsils and waaaay cheaper (and less painful) than removing your tonsils.</li>
<li> is the only one that exist to my knowledge, it is a bit shorter and small</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s too small for my big mouth.</li>
<li> so you can see, also use a depressor (pop sickle stick) to hold the tongue down while going for them and remember to be careful of the reflux</li>
<li> I bought this and was shocked at how cheap it is.</li>
<li> Plus, I didn&#x27;t get the other two attachments!</li>
<li> less than 10 seconds</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it for the light and that is great.  The ends don&#x27;t attach tightly enough to apply any pressure whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works, for years I&#x27;ve used a q tip it always hurt but got the job done, this takes less time and not nearly the pain.</li>
    <li> Far too short of a device and it broke easily.</li>
    <li> I found it kind of difficult to use since it has a tendency to make the tonsil to bleed.</li>
    <li> I, like another person on here, wanted to like it. It is puny, and I have a small mouth! The light is so dim I couldn&#x27;t see anything. Plus, I didn&#x27;t get the other two attachments! I don&#x27;t have big or frequent tonsil stones, and they are hidden behind a flap of skin. I was looking for one tool that would enable me to look for and remove any tonsil stone, but it&#x27;s back to my pen light and long stemmed q-tips! BTW, those 2 products are the perfect pair, and one hint, dip the swab in hydrogen peroxide.</li>
    <li> It works and I got the stones out! Which allowed my throat to heal up!</li>
    <li> light really helps removal</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something fishy about this item, there&#x27;s an Ear tool that looks exactly the same for $1.88&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judge it for yourselves:&lt;br /&gt;1. LED Lighted Curette Earpick Ear Wax Pick Remover Tool&lt;br /&gt;2. Leegoal Green Ear cleaning Tool Q-tip with flashlight and three accessories</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without this?!  This thing is amazing.</li>
    <li> Works great just wish it came with another tip.</li>
    <li> Reason 4 and not 3 below.&lt;br /&gt;Item is the only one that exist to my knowledge, it is a bit shorter and small then i thought which for me makes it a little difficult to use, the light does help a bit but not as much as a flash light, the only thing the light on this remover does best is give you a extra hand. I have had a few days to try it out, the first time trying it i noticed it was a bit sharp on the ends which could have been done better, such as given a smooth rubber like tip that had been hardened but can&#x27;t have everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem is the tips can easily come off if not careful use is not taken. A tip to using it is ensure you do not have a very bright room or lights in your eyes so you can see, also use a depressor (pop sickle stick) to hold the tongue down while going for them and remember to be careful of the reflux so you don&#x27;t throw up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip, you can use hydrogen peroxide mixed with half a cup of water, only put about 1 cap full of 3% peroxide into the 1/4th cup of water. Then gargle it around (make sure not to swallow it) then spit it out to help kill the germs and heal the tonsil tissue that may get damaged by using a sharp tool to stick into it. One important thing i want to warn you about is that it may be possible to cause more tissue damage to your tonsils by using this too much, if that happens you may develop more tonsil stones from the increased damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your stones.&lt;br /&gt;Place of knowledge: Step father is a oral surgeon in.</li>
    <li> Overall the concept is very appealing. To clean the back of the throat and the tonsils, this would have been a magnificent product but it&#x27;s too small for my big mouth. Will be looking for something larger</li>
    <li> This tool is kind of hard to use. Although, if you are gentle, it can be effective. The light is a great idea!</li>
    <li> Absolute crap in every way. Dim bulb, non-changeable battery as far as I can tell, and extremely poorly molded and manufactured. I didn&#x27;t feel safe holding the thing let alone putting it near my mouth. Here&#x27;s the real way to get rid of tonsil stones: Use a plastic syringe in one hand and a nice bright LED flashlight in the other. Go in front of the mirror and shine the flashlight into your throat. Spray your tonsils/tonsilur crypts with a jet of water from the syringe to knock out and flush out your tonsil stones. Rinse and gargle. Repeat daily and enjoy fresh breath and comfort.</li>
    <li> not a lot of options out there; this was a good product</li>
    <li> This works well.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Finally! This is the BEST tool out there... maybe because it&#x27;s the ONLY one of it&#x27;s kind currently available?  Even if it wasn&#x27;t the only one this is made decent and designed nicely for it&#x27;s purpose.  Built in light works great - allows other hand to become free to help with process or dangle around..</li>
    <li> Ill rate it 3 stars on the account i have not yet had the opportunity to use it. I will say that the $21 out-the-door amazon price of this product is a bit on the expensive side considering what you get. The product doesn&#x27;t seem to be of good quality. The seems of of the joints are not flush and properly aligned, and seems a bit flimsy. I bet it will do the job though. Anything is better then using a q-tip right? Just to have the light feature is a plus in my book.</li>
    <li> Great little tool! Allows you to really see in your tonsil crypts.</li>
    <li> Got just today.  I wish it were slightly longer to reach a little further back. But it does the trick.</li>
    <li> At first it seemed flimsy but the lite weight and built-in light helped a lot.</li>
    <li> It works great !!!! I bought this for my friend and She love it and I am happy because now I do not have to smell her bad breath my GOD !!!  Her breath smell good now.....</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and item is as depicted</li>
    <li> How did I live without this?  Seriously!  I’ve been fighting tonsil stones my entire life.  This is fantastic.  I’m shocked this is the only option for those of us with “Swiss Cheese” tonsils.&lt;br /&gt;Tonsil stones cause horrible breath and they hurt.  I’ve been digging with a flashlight and a cotton bud for years.  This makes the whole procedure much easier.  The tool is smooth, so no scratching yourself.  The light goes right where you’re working—genius!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the tools were a tiny bit longer, but I’m still giving this rave reviews!  If you’re thinking about this, then you need it.</li>
    <li> A creative little gadget that probably doesn&#x27;t cost much to make, but the design is what counts in this case.</li>
    <li> This tool is awesome for removing tonsil stones. Before this I was using jetted water picks (never above the lowest setting), while good for reaching deep behind the skin flap, the pulsing action sometimes hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the cheap led lit dental mirrors that came with the dental tools. This option was incredibly dangerous since the tools were sharp, but they did the trick when the jetted water pick couldn&#x27;t. I used the metal dental tools to lift the skin out of the way and used the mirror to push the stone out, but with normal breathing the mirror would get fogged up and seeing the stone became difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to try the blackhead remover tool method when I came across this nifty gadget on Amazon. The tool lights up allowing you to see the area that you are working on. I recommend getting a small hands free mirror to use while using this tool. I lean over the vanity trying to use the bathroom mirror, and sometimes I get frustrated not being able to get a closer look at what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I had was this, sometimes the plastic tip comes off while I&#x27;m working in my mouth. When this happens, it triggers a reflex. I removed a star for this since this could potentially choke someone with a strong enough reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed the kit that came with mine had 2 of the same size scoop tips with a tweezer tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it works better than any tool I have tried, and would still recommend it with caution.</li>
    <li> Ok, so . . I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get this, based on other reviews. However, I must say, as someone who only recently discovered that I tend to at times, have tonsil stones, which are horrendously yucky, this tool is super handy.  It provides clear illumination and since the tip is narrow, it really provides great smooth control so you can evacuate those nasty nasty stones.  I wish I would&#x27;ve discovered this earlier.  I use this in combination with gargling and inspecting my tonsils of course.</li>
    <li> Love it so much that I brought one for my daughter. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product.  Just what we needed.</li>
    <li> This tool is the greatest! I had a tonsil stone for like 4 weeks tried everything to get the sucker out.  As soon as I got it went to the bathroom mirror and it came out.  I wanted to cry. The person who make this object, you are on the right track. Please make it a little longer and also had a smaller piece.  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> Worked as adevertised</li>
    <li> If you have tonsil stones, this is what you need. I&#x27;m so glad this exists... Now if only I just didn&#x27;t get tonsil stones in the first place</li>
    <li> Great idea but it is too short and won&#x27;t reach all the stones in the back of throat...please extend it!!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Removed a large stone the first time I used it. My one suggestion for improvement is that the top part of the tool pops off with too little force. It popped off way in the back of my throat and I choked on it. Aside from wishing the top screwed onto the handle, this device is great!</li>
    <li> Felt the need to leave some feedback on this tool....its good!! After you get over the initial shock of the cost of the item and the fact that the quality is just ok, you will realize that it works as described. Look at it this way, waaaay cheaper then a constant dentist visit to clean out your tonsils and waaaay cheaper (and less painful) than removing your tonsils. It works and it works well for the purpose of removing those disgusting tonsil stones!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, FINALLY!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This can be used as a tonsil stone remover but that is NOT what it was designed for. The seller has re-purposed and re-titled a cheap ear wax remover, made in China, and more than quadrupled the price.  I bought this and was shocked at how cheap it is. They don&#x27;t even bother taking it out of its original packaging which has Chinese written all over it. I thought, &amp;#34;this cannot possibly cost this much&amp;#34;. Also, the tweezers tool does not work for removing tonsil stones. It&#x27;s really awkward. So I did some research.  You can find the EXACT SAME TOOL listed under ear wax remover for a tiny fraction of this cost. In the end I abandoned it all together and got an ear wax remover from my doctor to remove my tonsil stones. It looks like a stick with a little loop on the end and works 10 times better.</li>
    <li> Good idea but charged too much for this flimsy cheaply made product. also, difficult to change batteries.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable!  Such a cheaply made plastic tool did the job in one shot!  My 12 year old daughter has had a tonsil stone lodged for weeks. Not knowing what it was, I took her to Urgent Care. Then, I tried this tool as a last resort before taking her to the ear nose and throat doctor.&lt;br /&gt;In less than 10 seconds I had scoop out that nasty stone!  BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product - very easy to remove tonsil stones. I use it now daily when brushing my teeth, as a regular hygienic routine. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I must mention the seller - they were quick and helpful to replace one tool when it arrived damaged in transit.</li>
