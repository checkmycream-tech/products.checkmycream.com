      <li>Other than that it really ok</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t worth it especially if you&#x27;re like me and want to purchase it to get rid of old acne scars, it will just cause your spots to come back and get more scars.</li>
      <li>i wake up with white heads and super oily skin.</li>
      <li>It does make my skin soft but many other moisturizers can do that too</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> on my face it did nothing im still the same skin color and its really not cool at all i really didnt like this product</li>
    <li> Loved the packaging.  It&#x27;s young, fun and colorful.  Also liked the scent and solid form.  Very easy to apply.  Product is a little small, but I think it will go a long way.</li>
    <li> My Mena arrived on time and it was exactly what it was said to be, but I did not like this product. It was too messy to sleep with it on my face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Nice face cream.  But didn&#x27;t fade dark spots.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected.. but I guess I expected more. Umm.. First it took a little while for it to get here, and by then I had already bought Neutregana Naturals and it works amazing.... and plus when I got the product the box was messed up and opened so I won&#x27;t be using it. But that shouldn&#x27;t stop you from trying it. But I suggest you try other things before you try this. And if you looking for something to lighten up your skin and scars, I have been using lemon juice, from fresh lemons, but I also suggest you research that also! Overall the Mena seems okay.... It doesn&#x27;t seem like it super thick like other people say. It does stay a little white when I rubbed it in between my fingers, but it&#x27;s not extremely sticky or thick.</li>
    <li> Im very unhappy!!! it did not come in a box n it smells weired, ive bought it before and it is not the same smell</li>
    <li> Cream was extremely some. Next time check the size. Containers was small, therefore didn&#x27;t last long for me to say it had any results.  Might buy bigger size next time to see results.</li>
    <li> Although great postage and had recieved in a couple days the product broke me out completelty. I have suffered from acne a lot in my teens years and for the past 1 year have had great skin and this product completely broke me out. Dont purchase it girls. Isn&#x27;t worth it especially if you&#x27;re like me and want to purchase it to get rid of old acne scars, it will just cause your spots to come back and get more scars. so girls stay away! Also it has a terrible odur!</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. It did lighten my complexion, I used it only at night time and wore sunblock during the day.  i saw results as early as the second day, it does help with the acne and a little of this product really does go a long way. However it does dry out my skin so I do recommend it but make sure to use a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are not the same as indicated on Amazon. See pic</li>
    <li> For this price it is a great product.  It did smooth my skin out and made it VERY, VERY soft.  You should definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> i used it twice and threw it away it doesn&#x27;t worth a dime i guess, especially for oily skin. if you skin is oily to combination it will surely break you out during the night as it did to me i wake up with white heads and super oily skin. plus the little jar that the cream comes with has almost nothing in it, it is a super thin layer of cream i got it with 8 bucks too bad! i thought it will clear my skin from acne scar and brightens it but i couldn&#x27;t take it more than 2 days and ended up throwing it away i don&#x27;t recommend this for oily skin!! :)</li>
    <li> Waste of money and time</li>
    <li> I love this product, i have been using it for years!  It gives my skin a beautiful glow, unlike those other skin lightening products.  A+++++</li>
    <li> This stuff does NOT work, just makes a mess. And the jar is extremely small, filled with only a small amount. Lasted me about literally 10 days if that. Don&#x27;t believe the other reviews or the reviews u see on YouTube, it&#x27;s all lies. Only good thing was the shipping came in about a wk and I wasn&#x27;t expecting it till the end of the more.</li>
    <li> It took about 2 weeks to get here. Its geisha makeup. It does not permanently lighten face. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I should of known what I was getting for the price it only lasted me for 1 week and i cant imaging what one size up will last. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Worse product ever. I am black and this made me darker and gave this weird oily tinge to my face.</li>
    <li> This product was absalutely amazing!! Mena clears skin discolorations from old acne scars to sun damage. Within a week I was able to see quick results. If your tired of wasting your money on products that dont deliver results try Mena. I strongly recommend this product. Best skin fading product on the market.</li>
    <li> I was so anxious to receive my mena. I love the way it feels on my skin. Not only did it lighten my blemishes but, now my face is even tone all over. I have suggested this to everyone I know with skin discoloration and acne. I don&#x27;t even break out the way I use to before using this product.</li>
    <li> works great for me, i been using this product for 3 days now but all and all its good and makes ur face so smooth , i have acne and pimples bcoz of the hair laser removal its breakout my face soo bad and its the 1st time ever happen in my life to have bad acne and pimples, while using this product i also taking solodyn tablets once a day and i guess this is the good combination for those who have bad acne, pimples scars and dark spots. the cream smells good too,  ( i have Asian skin ) now my face gets better and clearer.</li>
    <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.  And, there was so little of it.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. I really think it works.</li>
    <li> very disappointed, the product was so small, look more like a toy for a doll house. the content was about 1/8 of a inch thick.</li>
    <li> This cream is great, totally worked for me since I have dry skin. This product works. Glad I found it and it&#x27;s a great value too!</li>
    <li> I love the way mena feels it works and makes my skin nice and soft the only bad thing about it that it&#x27;s so little I need a bigger size</li>
    <li> BEST PRDUCT UNDER THE SUN IT HELPS TO EVEN SKIN TONE AND BRIGHTENS UP YOUR FACE ALOT SO IT&#x27;S GREAT</li>
    <li> PRODUCT IS NO GOOD DO NOT WORK.</li>
    <li> This is a knockoff. This isn&#x27;t the original Mena cream I recommend not buying this !!!!!</li>
    <li> Container looks full but once I start using it it was a thin layer and under just plastic. Don&#x27;t even last a week. I&#x27;m  unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I heard about this from a subscriber on Youtube. She stated that it has all natural ingredients and lightened her acne scars and skin complexion faster than anything else she&#x27;s tried. So, I ordered it. After the 3rd day of using the product, I noticed that my skin began to glow and look smoother. I&#x27;ve used it for a week thus far and have gotten compliments on my skin from my mother. She said it looks pretty. I plan to order more very soon to get rid of all my acne scars from my teenage years.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive so I broke out really bad on my forehead. I like that it did stay on all night but it did leave a mess on my pillow case. I didn&#x27;t see any whitening because I broke out the second day so I stopped using it</li>
    <li> Awful don&#x27;t waste your $1</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in anything. My scars are still major dark . It&#x27;s messy and hard to sleep with on . Other than that it really ok</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! After only one week of use, I have noticed my skin and complexion has become smoother and healthier looking. This product is also very easy to apply and does leave any residue on my face after application. I am very satisfied with this purchase and I plan on reordering in the future.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  work. Caused major breakout.</li>
    <li> This cream is the worst. It&#x27;s full of Talc powder and on dark skin it makes you look like a ghost. It&#x27;s perfect for Holloween if you are going as a Japanese Geidsha girl!</li>
    <li> This product is really good when it comes to whitening your face and neck, i suggest this for people that has sensitive skin and Also that the packaging is okay and overall this Product is great :) It shipped earlier than expected which is good..</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly, and although small it was packed with cream. The cream is thick, and applies well. It&#x27;s a great cover up, and the area I applied it to seems lighter. The price was right as well...</li>
    <li> It was a waist of money and time. Did not work on my skin. The only thing I used this cream for was to put it under med dark makeup to give me the skin I wanted.</li>
    <li> i was not impressed with this cream.IT DOES NOT BLEND WELL ON MY SKIN.I WILL NOT ORDER THIS AGAIN,I WILL TRY TO FIND A SIMILAR PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I have nothing, no product are our money for it.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK AT ALL ! DID NOT EVEN REMOVE ONE SPOT NOR LIGHTEN A DROP ! KEEP YOUR MONEY IN YOUR POCKET BOO</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really messy and hard to get rid off. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. It might work for some people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Worked well for me I juts don&#x27;t like to tiny little box it comes in.  And it&#x27;s a little hard to each off but definitely cleared up my face more than other products.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on glowing reviews from youtubers and amazon, this cream cannot be worn at all during the day, it&#x27;s thick and leaves you with a white talcum face that becomes dry and flaky- not a good look. Wore it at night  and after a few weeks- skin was same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.  You only get a very small amount too so you&#x27;d need like 10 jars of it to last you a month so don&#x27;t be fooled by the small price- it&#x27;s relative to the quantity you&#x27;re getting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only good point is if you oily skin will make your skin look (grey) matt! And it smells nice</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all and it is very messy. Won&#x27;t purchase again. It is just a waste of your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thicker than I thought. The jars don&#x27;t hold much cream, so you must order more than one. But, the price is great. Shipping is average speed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It takes about a week for you to see results although, I started to see results after the second day of using it. It clears up acne scars and lightens your skin. I think that with regular usage, you will achieve about 2 shades lighter in about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks. There is enough to last you for about a month and it is gentle on your skin. This is a great product.!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed...after all the great reviews I decided to buy three. I used them during the winter break so I put a generous amount everyday, day and night. My face was covered in this product 24 hours for 3 weeks hoping that would show a big difference but it didn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable change. My face was a bit more softer but that&#x27;s it. I have a little kelirosis pilarisis on both of my cheeks and it temporarily helped smooth them out a little, no change on my skin tone. My family is light skinned but I became a shade darker after staying out in the sun a lot with no protection so I thought mena would be lighten me faster than a person born with dark skin. It didn&#x27;t even help out with a dark spot a pimple left behind. Like I said I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it went on white &amp; chalky smudges on everything and the remaining bit is very hard to come off .plus I see no results.. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and it works well with my normal routine.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet the content was so little I am all ready out not much difference thought. Not sure if I would purchase more.think you have to use it for a while before you can see results</li>
    <li> It is very small and cute like. It is sort of hard to place on faces it makes you skin feel softer after one day in use. I came early .</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again because, not onl;y does it to appear to not work at all, the packaging was so much smaller than anticipated. I am not even sure why I bought this....</li>
    <li> Helps little by little</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not seeing a difference and I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now. I don&#x27;t put it on every night just every other night so idk if that has anything to do with it. Also I&#x27;m brown complexion not too dark not to light and since I&#x27;ve been using this product my spots are still dark and my skin is still the same color. I will continue to use the product and update as I go but as of now I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works great on troubled acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> From the product description it had different ingredients it had: beeswax , vitamin e, titanium dioxide, lanolin anhydrous, cetyl alcohol, Vaseline white, white mineral oil, glycerine, steric acid, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, perfume, FD&amp;yellow #6,glycerol monostearate. So I don&#x27;t know If I&#x27;m supposed to use it on my acne scars or not even on YouTube the costumer reviews say different ingredients. It does make my skin soft but many other moisturizers can do that too</li>
    <li> IT DOES NOT WORK ALL IT DOES IS MAKE YOUR FACE REALLY DRY WHO EVER IS THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS PRODUCT DON&#x27;T BUY BECAUSE YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on YouTube. I don&#x27;t care much about the skin whitening part I just care about getting rid of acne scars and this is the perfect product for it! I purchased this about a week ago and my acne scars are fading and I have less acne. Now I can&#x27;t reallysay much about the skin lightening because I am out in the sun because I&#x27;m always leaving the house. The container is small but it will last you unless you jam your hand in it. I seriously don&#x27;t understand the point of the bottom part of the jar because there is nothing in it. The cream is literally a thin layer on a plate lol. I want to thank the brand for giving a free sample of promina I love it and I will buy more of these products In the future.</li>
    <li> I was impressed I didn&#x27;t think it would work, I&#x27;m very satisfied just wish it had more in of it in the canister.</li>
</ol>
