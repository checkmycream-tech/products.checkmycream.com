    <li> works great...able to save a good pair of liners.</li>
    <li> This cord was a lifesaver. Came in brand new in the package and saved me.from. using another T-Outliner.</li>
    <li> Direct replacement.  My clippers are good as new.</li>
    <li> Had no idea I would actually find a power cord for my trimmers on AMAZON! I&#x27;ve gotten to the point now that I check AMAZON for any and everything I think I won&#x27;t be able to find. I was prepared to buy another set of trimmers. I replaced the blades, and now the power cord and they perform like new and I fully expect to get a few more years out of them. Thanks!</li>
