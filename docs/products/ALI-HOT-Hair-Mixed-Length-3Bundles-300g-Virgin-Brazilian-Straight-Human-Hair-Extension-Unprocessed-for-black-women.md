      <li>but overall I love the quality of the hair...</li>
      <li>When the new order came in, the hair was straight and smooth no issues at all.</li>
      <li>it is true to length and its EXTREMELY soft!</li>
      <li>The color was more of a soft black with sort of red highlights instead of dark brown, but I dyed my hair and the extensions &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; and they matched perfectly.</li>
      <li>The hair was bundled up in some plastic bag and looked like someone took one whole hair</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t shredded or anything, still very Silky </li>
      <li>Bundles are about 1/3 of a real bundle.</li>
      <li>I love this hair I will not order from any other vendor at these people are reliable and fast this hair is high quality will not use anything else on my clients</li>
      <li>THEY WERE KIND OF SMALL THOUGH.</li>
      <li>Very soft, shiny!</li>
      <li>and it looks brand new.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re still like new.</li>
      <li>The hair was Very soft, manageable, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with tangles.</li>
      <li>First of all I&#x27;m waiting on my 2nd order now.</li>
      <li>First of all the packaging is a thousand times different from that in the picture.</li>
      <li>OTHER THAN THAT THE OTHER BUNDLES WERE NICE</li>
      <li>I recommend this to anybody that wants long shiny soft hair !!</li>
      <li>Sealed them up completely.</li>
      <li>I ordered straight hair but recieved body wave and only got 2 bundles out of 3.</li>
      <li>Pricing is very reasonable and I dyed and bleached it 4 different colors and washed it a bunch of times and the quality still remained the same.</li>
      <li>For the treatment I used 30v pure white developer and blue flash powder!</li>
      <li>The hair had split ends but was easily fixable with the L&#x27;Oréal Mega Spritz and Wet 2 Dry flat iron.</li>
      <li>It is human but not raw hair.</li>
      <li>It does not have a bad smell and this hair is a very beautiful dark brown.</li>
      <li>it became wavy, the hair is not naturally straight..however hair remained soft and shiny but it&#x27;s definitely processed from the sender.</li>

    <li> ONLY TWO OF THE THREE BUNDLES WERE GOOD! THE TRID ONE WAS WAVY, WAS WET AND WREAKED OF MILDEW! OTHER THAN THAT THE OTHER BUNDLES WERE NICE THEY WERE KIND OF SMALL THOUGH. I WISH I WAS ABLE TO CONTACT THE SELLER TO GET A REPLACEMENT BUNDLE  THAT IS CORRECT......update I&#x27;ve had this hair in for over a month and it is still perfect . Some of the best hair after I fixed the wet bundle</li>
    <li> This hair is great! Very soft, shiny! I bleached it and it took the treatment wonderfully! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is they get very thin towards the ends. Even though I put most of the 300g in my hair! For the treatment I used 30v pure white developer and blue flash powder! Both found at Sally Beauty!</li>
    <li> Hair is amazing I died mine and still love it it also  shipped very fast received mine in 2days just in time for my trip to Vegas THIS HAIR IS A MUST ORDER</li>
    <li> This only took 3 days to get to my house, I can already tell this is good hair it is true to length and its EXTREMELY soft! It does not have a bad smell and this hair is a very beautiful dark brown. I ordered these in the leg the 16&amp;#34; 18&amp;#34; and 20 inch and I gotta say, these bundles of hair are very THICK!! and the bundles are huge and they do get thinner at the ends but not by much. It is shiny and has a nice texture to it. I am very happy with this purchase. I will give an update on this hair in two weeks to tell how it is. Also forgot to add: the ends are in very good shape.! I recommend this to anybody that wants long shiny soft hair !!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months and no problem with it. It hasn&#x27;t shredded or anything, still very Silky </li>
    <li> This hair is very soft it has a nice texture and the bundles are huge I ordered a 16&amp;#34; 18&amp;#34; and a 20&amp;#34;. This hair is true to length and I have had it for about a week now. It does not tangle at all and this is definitely virgin hair. It doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell either. I love this hair I will be buying it again. It flows and its shiny. It has no shedding either. I washed it once and it just got softer!! This is very good hair for the price I do recommend !!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair great smooth texture. True to description, shipped super fast and on time, bundles are nice sized and hair and color is true to length. I made a u-part with the hair and I love it! Should definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;m waiting on my 2nd order now. I love this hair and it&#x27;s amazing for the price . I&#x27;ve dyed it and it was a little brittle but conditioned it and it snaped back into shape. I&#x27;ve been wearing this hair for about 2 months and it&#x27;s been great! I&#x27;m very low maintenance when it comes to hair . I wash it and add a little coconut oil and it looks brand new. Will recommend this hair to anyone!</li>
    <li> This hair is great!!!!! No shedding or tangles. It styles and curls amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> The hair is great 3 bundles was more than enough. I ordered 16,18 and 20 inch an the 20 inch was a lot longer than I thought. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I&#x27;ve had this hair in 3weeks now an it shedding but overall I love the quality of the hair...</li>
    <li> I love this hair. I was nervous about buying but I knew someone who had and the prices did not match how good it looked. Pricing is very reasonable and I dyed and bleached it 4 different colors and washed it a bunch of times and the quality still remained the same. I love it and recommended  it to friends</li>
    <li> I ordered the 16, 18, and 20in extensions in dark brown. The quality of the hair is amazing, it curls, straightens, anything you need it to. The color was more of a soft black with sort of red highlights instead of dark brown, but I dyed my hair and the extensions &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; and they matched perfectly. I&#x27;ve had them for over a month now and wear them almost everyday and they&#x27;re still like new. Great product.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this hair and it came so fast its so pretty and soft i get it installed next week can&#x27;t wait 😊</li>
    <li> First off let me say, I ordered this hair to make my own clip ins with them. I like to measure them into my hair, cut the wefts and sew two wefts together to make them thick and blend into my thick hair. Sew clips on them and I can style however I want from there. A lot of work but worth it, you get more out of your money this way.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this hair from Uniwigs.&lt;br /&gt;Uniwigs seller 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Hair 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;They had excellent and amazing customer service. I ordered straight hair but recieved body wave and only got 2 bundles out of 3. The hair had split ends but was easily fixable with the L&#x27;Oréal Mega Spritz and Wet 2 Dry flat iron. Sealed them up completely. Uniwigs responded quickly and replaced my order without me going through the returning process. When the new order came in, the hair was straight and smooth no issues at all. The hair was Very soft, manageable, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with tangles. I made my clips and ombre&#x27;d the bottom of the hair. The dye did make the ends split a little but the Spritz fixed that, the only reason this hair got 4 stars was due to the split ends. I am a fair reviewer even though the order was messed up at 1st, I&#x27;m not rating my review on that. I&#x27;m rating my review on the quality of the product (Hair) and the seller I bought from. Hopefully this helps.</li>
    <li> after being installed one week hair started matting in the back , looks trashy I had to take it out, really disappointed as I am outside of the U.S. and paid a lot of money to get it to where I am</li>
    <li> Do not order!! Bundles are about 1/3 of a real bundle. I ordered 3 bundles and got 1. I am pissed!! The worst!!</li>
    <li> The bundles are thin if ure getting longer lengths 3 bundles will NOT be enuff. The hair isn&#x27;t virgin hair. It is human but not raw hair. My hair came jet blk no grays. Raw hair doesn&#x27;t come solid. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the hair if u want to lighten it being that it&#x27;s already been colored. The price is worth it. Would buy again.  Update:  Washed the hair nd it became wavy, the hair is not naturally straight..however hair remained soft and shiny but it&#x27;s definitely processed from the sender.</li>
    <li> I was so exited to come home to meet the hair. I saw the box and I knew there was something wrong. First of all the packaging is a thousand times different from that in the picture. The hair was bundled up in some plastic bag and looked like someone took one whole hair n cut it in three places, folded it n tied it with gold strings. The ends are so thin it makes the hair look worse than feathers. I do not want to discount the testament of those with great experience but this thing is totally for the BIRDS. I wasted no time in requesting for a return.</li>
    <li> I love this hair I will not order from any other vendor at these people are reliable and fast this hair is high quality will not use anything else on my clients</li>
    <li> I ordered the hair on Saturday and received the hair on Tuesday. The bundles (16,18,20)  are very thick. There was no odor and no shedding when I ran my fingers through the hair. I plan on getting it installed soon and I will add a picture of the final product.</li>
    <li> So far my daughter love this hair she said it&#x27;s no shedding or tangling yet 16,18 and 20&#x27;&#x27;  she have it on for 2 weeks now!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use to buy from another company here at amazon the hair was HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;so yes This best hair on Amazon</li>
    <li> Though it took it a week to receive it was well worth the wait!!!  As soon as I got it I washed and conditioned it,  hair still soft and natural feeling NO SHEDDING!!!!!!!  With the brush they sent I brushed through it and let it air dry! After a few hours I installed and I love it!!!  I will be buying again thanks ! Ohhh and they double package it as if it was breakable so A++++++++ FOR HANDLING!</li>
