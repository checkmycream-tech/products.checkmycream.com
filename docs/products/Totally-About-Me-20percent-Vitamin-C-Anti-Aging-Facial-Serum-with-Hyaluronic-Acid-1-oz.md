<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now, I can visibly see the wrinkles thinning out quite a bit. Which is ALWAYS a plus! I would reccommend you trying this product to see how it works for you. If I am any indication, it works as it should.. Will be buying from again!</li>
    <li> I love how this make my face feel!  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now and definitely notice a difference in the health of my skin. It feels great to the touch, and I find I experience less breakouts. I have scars from old acne breakouts but my skin tone is also starting to even out. I apply this after cleaning my face and prior to putting on a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> First off this smells way better than the last vitamin C serum I tried.  So far it absorbs really well and my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> Two days of using this and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments from people wanting to know what I did because my skin looked so youthful and radiant. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This product is great!!!! It was almost instant results as far as smoothing out my skin. It isn&#x27;t greedy and doesn&#x27;t smell. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my results are after a few weeks!!!! Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel sticky and stiff!  I just started using at bed time... thought that might be better!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quick. It is a bit oily and leaves a shine behind, but not heavy like a lotion sometimes is. Its hard to tell in such a short period whether its really working, but i will update when i have results.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my face feel very soft and moisturized without the stickiness. Cant wait to see results.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  Maybe for others, but it made my face feel really tight after I applied it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! It delivers every promise made and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy like many I&#x27;ve tried. This definitely will stay in my daily regimen!</li>
    <li> Too sticky... tried using at night, can&#x27;t stand the feeling!</li>
    <li> I was really surprised how fast this product came and my girlfriend says it works even faster.  She said she feels like her skin is softer and brighter and I can tell she has more confidence too.  My girlfriend and I definitely recommend this product and I&#x27;ve thought about starting to use it too.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have been using this twice a day for the last four days and I can see that my face is brighter. It goes on smooth and does not feel sticky. I can easily apply my makeup over it. I will continue to use and I hope to see more results with my sun damaged skin.</li>
    <li> This serum has become apart of my cleaning and night time bed ritual. It feels so good going on. It makes my skin feel so soft. I can see a depletion in the amount of small crows feet and laugh lines on my face. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it can do given more time.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for about 2 weeks. After applying the serum, my face felt a little tight ( that&#x27;s a good thing). After 2 weeks I am noticing less brown spots and smoother skin. I am 61 and don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but am concerned about sagging and uneven tone.  I have used many other products with a greater cost and less results.  I feel the Vitamin C Serum is a good value for the money and I look forward to greater results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum. Thanks for making a great product that truly delivers on its promise.</li>
    <li> Works wonders. I visible feel it erased my crows eyes.  Definitely invest in your skin and buy this product</li>
    <li> Amazing so far! Had it for three days you can feel it working minutes after you apply!! Definite repurchase!!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Really does what it promised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy. My skin feels softer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about 5 days into trying this out. It does make my skin look brighter &amp; more vibrant. I&#x27;ve learned that I don&#x27;t care for how it feels under make-up, got kind of filmy/cakey feeling...but when I went back to only using at night or on days when I wasn&#x27;t wearing make-up, I no longer had any problems with it. I really do like how my skin looks &amp; feels after application! Also, their customer service has been fabulous, emailing me back &amp; forth about my experiences with the product. Good customer service is sadly too rare!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks and my skin looks a lot better. I have sensitive skin and I was worried about redness...but there was none.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this in the morning 4 days in a row... By the middle of the day my face and neck turn bright red. I&#x27;ll continue to use this to see if it is just something my skin needs to get used to.  The consistency is watery.. Not like a serum.  The day it was delivered it was in the negative temperatures and it sat outside for about 7 hours until I got home from work. Maybe that had something to do with it.</li>
    <li> Makes face feel tighter by 1st use.&lt;br /&gt;Have not noticed reduced redness.&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is a watery serum.&lt;br /&gt;I use 2 pumps to get a nice coverage for entire face. (The picture I included is one pump)&lt;br /&gt;Works good as a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Makeup applies well over it.&lt;br /&gt;If no makeup is applied it does leave face a bit shinny.&lt;br /&gt;Does not make face feel sticky or any residue feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I can&#x27;t tell if it works.&lt;br /&gt;Only used for about a week so I will report updates.</li>
    <li> I like how this feels going on my skin but have decided to only use at night because it feels a little sticky when it dries.  It does make my skin look and feel better.</li>
    <li> Delivery on time. I  use it to care my hands because I often wash the dishes by my hand , so my hands look elder than I am. After a week use, my hands become more lightly and not so dry. I&#x27;ll keep use and hope it will keep works well to me.</li>
    <li> I have a use this product twice daily since I have received it and the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed so far is that my skin feels tighter after I use it. If I  find any other effects it might have I will report them at a later date.  I received this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I love this product, left my skin feeling silky smooth :)</li>
    <li> I am a lotion/wrinkle stuff junkie! If its out there and helps you look younger, I have probably used it. This product ranks up there in my top ten. Refreshing to use, you can even feel your skin getting tighter. Use twice a day! You will love your results!</li>
    <li> This is a great serum for your skin. I&#x27;m 51 years old and, though I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles yet, I do have a few around my eyes. I put them serum on just the area around my eyes at first, but when I felt how soft it made my skin I applied it all over my face. It does make your skin feel a bit tighter, but you can apply a moisturizer over it if it&#x27;s enough to bother you. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and my skin is so soft and smooth. I&#x27;m talking baby soft! On a 51 year old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days now and already seeing results.I have very sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always leery of putting anything on my skin for fear of breaking out or getting seriously dry skin. That hasn&#x27;t happened yet with this serum. I will update this review if there are any changes after using this product a little longer.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and goes on silky&lt;br /&gt;smooth.  Performs just as well as other vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;serums I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I find that it also&lt;br /&gt;works great as a makeup base.  No extra&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer necessary as this product&lt;br /&gt;packs a lot of moisture.  One pump is&lt;br /&gt;enough as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving four stars for now because I just started using. I can see a difference in my skin. It feels very soft. I&#x27;m hopefully that will help fade some of my discoloration. But that will take time. But if your looking for facial cream to make your face feel nice and soft. This is for you.</li>
    <li> It is a very smooth cream that feels very nice!!  I just got it and used it once, but you can feel the difference.</li>
