      <li>When it arrived my daughters started using it and love it too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over a year now and love it.</li>
      <li>and so glad I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on a hyped up \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; straightener.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It would also suck out all the moisture from my hair, leaving it even more damaged.</li>
      <li>This T-studio straightener worked wonders, making my hair look healthy again.</li>
      <li>No frizz :]    </li>
      <li>This straightener is fantastic!</li>
      <li>It straightens hair just as quickly and effectively.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, my daughter, who hates having her hair brushed or anything, doesn&#x27;t complain when we use this to straighten her hair for special occasions</li>
      <li>I have had this for about a year and it is still going strong.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine</li>
      <li>So after doing some research about ceramic vs. tourmaline, it was obvious that tourmaline was the way to go, so I was very happy to find this as a very affordable option!</li>
      <li>I use TIGI BedHead Control Freak Serum with the straightener, which my hair stylist recommended and is also available at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s great :)</li>
      <li>This one straightens super fast and nicely.</li>
      <li>I also like how you can program the exact temperature within 10 degrees C, rather than just turning a dial and estimating like most irons.   </li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>Also, I originally bought this on Amazon but found it at Ulta for $29.99</li>
      <li>As a first timer, I didn&#x27;t want to spend alot of something that I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the results or not.  </li>
      <li>So far, I am really satisfied!    </li>
      <li>so the host turned on the misters to cool us off.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this flat iron because it is cheap and it works great.</li>
      <li>I also like that it heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>This model heats up fast and the digital display is great.  </li>
      <li>This is my first flat iron, and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and leaves my hair just as smooth and shiny now as it did when I first took it out of the box 3 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I was reluctant to purchase this item because of the brand and low price, but after reading the reviews I decided to try it out and am very glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m very satisfied with it, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>It was very hot</li>
      <li>gave me a quick straight look!!</li>
      <li>I have only had this product for one month, but it works great so far!</li>
      <li>I have curly hair that is fine but very frizzy.</li>
      <li>It also cools down very fast after unplugging which is great for traveling/safety.</li>
      <li>I figured so many great reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong, and I was right!  </li>
      <li>This straightener works really great on long hair and it helps the whole straightening process go much faster.</li>
      <li>Well, unless I&#x27;m standing right out in the rain.</li>
      <li>I love the digital heat settings and the quick warm-up.  </li>
      <li>The digital readout allows you to reach very high salon caliber temperatures so it  can straighten even the most curly hair!</li>
      <li>My only caveat is that if you have bangs, you may want to go with the one inch size b/c the two inch is too large to straighten bangs effectively.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely sold on straighteners; this one specifically is great, especially considering the price.  </li>
      <li>It heats up very fast, and will automatically shut off after an hour if you forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an excellent hair straightener by Remington, especially for people with thick hair it leaves your hair straight without frizz and feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I could not find the exact type, bought another brand</li>
      <li>The old saying you get what you pay for is typically a pretty accurate saying</li>
      <li>it worked great for my thick wavy hair..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I listened to all the reviews and did not spend $100+ for a same quality straightener!</li>
      <li>The only thing that I was not real happy with at first was the fact that this is a thicker iron which I am used to the slim ones, but I have gotten used to it and am now very happy with it!    </li>
      <li>It is not necessary to spend triple digits for a straightener as this one works extremely well and is in perfect condition (compared to my old Conair).</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>This flat iron does the trick very well without pulling and breaking the hair like most irons do.</li>
      <li>however, the digital dial make it really easy for the user to know how hot the iron really is.</li>
      <li>It also never snags on my hair which was a huge problem with my last iron.  </li>
      <li>The combination of the serum and the straightener really does keep my hair straight.  </li>
      <li>seems to be), if that makes any real difference.</li>
      <li>It works very well.  </li>
      <li>The perm did so much damage that it created so much frizz and tangles that it was uncontrollable.</li>
      <li>I would have to straighten one spot over and over again to make it completely straight.</li>
      <li>My hair lasts for weeks after using this straightener (my hair is somewhat straight already).</li>
      <li>It makes it so incredibly straight, and got out all the frizz and kinks.</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Afterwards, she also remarked at how fast she could straighten her hair.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a CHI, I highly recommend this one!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this for my 20-year old son for Xmas.  It works very well.  His friend with frizzy hair became totally straight in just a few minutes.  The only issue is that it&#x27;s &#x27;pink&#x27; in color and I didn&#x27;t know or realize that when I ordered.</li>
    <li> I was window shopping for a new flat iron but after reading several reviews for different kinds of flat irons, I was curious about my current flat iron&#x27;s reviews.  At first I was shocked to see it with a 5/5 rating, but when I tried to think of any problems or quirks I&#x27;ve had with mine....I couldn&#x27;t think of any.  I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for nearly 3 years and it has never snagged my hair, taken too long to heat up, or given me any grief.  It&#x27;s quick and leaves my hair just as smooth and shiny now as it did when I first took it out of the box 3 years ago.  Definitely not looking for a new flat iron anymore &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> its a great value for $$.. i was going to get myself a much more expensive sedu after trying it out at my friends place.. but decided to go with this one for intermediate use since i was on a tight budget.. it worked great for my thick wavy hair.. gave me a quick straight look!!.. i recommend using good shampoo and styling products like Chi silk infusion etc with it for the glossy finish.. the end result for me was splendid! i think im going to stick with it!</li>
    <li> My neice has the same straightener. I used it and loved it.  I looked around for the same make and model that she had and found it on Amazon and bought it right away.  When it arrived my daughters started using it and love it too.  Our old straightend used to pull our hair and it looked frizzy.  This straightener makes your hair feel really good.  My daughters have had complimants after they started using it.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I just bought this today and I am so in love with it! I have naturally straight hair but recently got a perm (big mistake!!). The perm did so much damage that it created so much frizz and tangles that it was uncontrollable. I was reluctant at first to try this because my previous straightener (Remington Wet 2 Straight) used to work fine until I got my perm, then it couldn&#x27;t handle the curls. I would have to straighten one spot over and over again to make it completely straight. It would also suck out all the moisture from my hair, leaving it even more damaged. This T-studio straightener worked wonders, making my hair look healthy again. It makes it so incredibly straight, and got out all the frizz and kinks. My hair also feels soft, instead of rough and course like it usually is. It also takes half the time, since I don&#x27;t have to keep straightening one part over and over. I even compared it to my roomates&#x27;s straighteners, (both Conairs) and mine is definitly better! I&#x27;m so glad I listened to all the reviews and did not spend $100+ for a same quality straightener! Also, I originally bought this on Amazon but found it at Ulta for $29.99</li>
    <li> I asked for this flat iron for Christmas after reading all of the reviews.  I had a much more expensive flat iron that broke and the price on this seemed too good to be true, but I gave it a shot.  I was not disappointed.  This model heats up fast and the digital display is great.  It also never snags on my hair which was a huge problem with my last iron.  I have been using it almost every day since getting in December and it&#x27;s wearing very well (hardly at all so far).  It also has a 1-hour automatic shut off (there were countless times when I couldn&#x27;t remember if I unplugged my last iron).  It also cools down very fast after unplugging which is great for traveling/safety.</li>
    <li> (2 weeks ownership so far.)    Ordered for my daughter and she loves it.      Without knowing any construction details, she says it works much better, quicker and smoother than her first unit (which was OK while it worked but then failed after less than 5 uses: [[ASIN:B0000AHS9X Conair CS4JCS Ceramic Hair Straightener, 3/4-Inch Plates]] ).      I selected it based not only on the features and reasonable cost but on the lack of failure complaints from previous reviewers.  I&#x27;m simply hoping that this unit will prove to be reliable in the long run.      It certainly looks and \\&quot;feels\\&quot; professional grade as compared to the other unit, and the heating plates \\&quot;appear\\&quot; to be actual ceramic blocks (versus \\&quot;coated\\&quot; like the other unit seems to be), if that makes any real difference.</li>
    <li> The old saying you get what you pay for is typically a pretty accurate saying but I would have to say that that is all out the window when considering this straightener!  It works extremely well and that is coming from someone who normally buys the \\&quot;high end\\&quot; straighteners which work well but are far to expensive!!!!!!!!!!!  This works every bit as good as the expensive brands for an absolute fraction of the price!  The only thing that I was not real happy with at first was the fact that this is a thicker iron which I am used to the slim ones, but I have gotten used to it and am now very happy with it!    Amber</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a year and it is still going strong. It is not necessary to spend triple digits for a straightener as this one works extremely well and is in perfect condition (compared to my old Conair).</li>
    <li> I had the wet to dry hair straightener by the same company but it just died one day so I recently bought this straightener. It&#x27;s great! My hair is thick and wavy and this product made my hair look healthy and still thick instead of flattened to my head like with my old straightener.</li>
    <li> easy to use , good results,little concern about shape of it,when using it don&#x27;t get it to close to your skin,you can get burn easily</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair straightener by Remington, especially for people with thick hair it leaves your hair straight without frizz and feeling smooth. I had another just like this one but lost it on a trip i went on. I could not find the exact type, bought another brand but it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my hair which is very thick, I came home searched on Amazon.com hoping to find one and I did. I ordered it right away because this one does work great.</li>
    <li> This straightener works wonderfully! My straightener of 3 years recently broke and I&#x27;d already tried two others, but to no avail, before this one.  After reading the reviews, I decided to chance yet another.  I love the digital heat settings and the quick warm-up.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a CHI, I highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over a year now and love it. I recently lost it on a trip and am ordering the exact same product. Not only is it a small fraction of what I&#x27;ve paid for other straighteners, it&#x27;s better! It&#x27;s lighter to hold (without feeling flimsy) and has never once caught my hair with the plates. That&#x27;s been a common problem with previous straighteners. My wavy-to-curly hair ends up smooth, shiny and healthy-looking, but not lifeless or limp. I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know who uses a straightener.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for one month, but it works great so far! I previously had a CHI 2 inch iron,but this seems to work just as well and was less than half the price. I also like how you can program the exact temperature within 10 degrees C, rather than just turning a dial and estimating like most irons.   I don&#x27;t think this iron gets quite as hot as the CHI, but I have pretty curly and coarse hair and it works for me.    I would definitely recommend it !</li>
    <li> This straightener is fantastic! I couldn&#x27;t believe the great price and love the amount of heat settings available. This has been a wonderful product for myself and my daughter. I even love the pink tourmaline plates! Best of all, my daughter, who hates having her hair brushed or anything, doesn&#x27;t complain when we use this to straighten her hair for special occasions becasuse her hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck and/or pull when using this straightener! Love it and so glad I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on a hyped up \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; straightener.</li>
    <li> This straghtener was purchased to replace a \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; straightener (priced at over $100) that was lost during a recent vacation trip.  I was reluctant to purchase this item because of the brand and low price, but after reading the reviews I decided to try it out and am very glad that I did.  It crushes my old straightener like a grape.  It straightens hair just as quickly and effectively.  And, my old straightener had the problem that almost every time I used it, several strands of hair would get caught in the edges of the straightener, sometimes pulling the hairs out.  Ouch.  No such problems with the Remington.  A great buy all around.</li>
    <li> After a long while, I finally decided to get a straightener.  After a bit of research, I found this straightener.  As a first timer, I didn&#x27;t want to spend alot of something that I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the results or not.  But I am really happy with this product.  It works really well, heats up quickly, the tips of the arms help hold the arms in place, adjustable heating, no catching of hair, make my hair feel smooth and silky, and the rotating cord is very convenient ~ so no tangling of the cord.  A couple of things though, is that (and maybe it&#x27;s just me) but my hand gets tired because it is a little heavy and strangely the instructions that came with it said it had a latch of sorts that kept the arms locked in place for storage...um...must have been a typo because there is no latch.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m very satisfied with it, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice iron, doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for thick non-permed ethnic hair.  It did absolutely nothing to my hair.  I think for my hair I have to find an iron that gets at minimum 450 degrees.  I think this one is about 300-350.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best straighter out there, and it&#x27;s affordable! The digital readout allows you to reach very high salon caliber temperatures so it  can straighten even the most curly hair! Great for defrizzing as well!!!</li>
    <li> what a great product. this is a little different from other straighteners i&#x27;ve had because it is 2 and a quarter inches long. however, the digital dial make it really easy for the user to know how hot the iron really is. this is a salon quality flat iron and is at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get it!</li>
    <li> This straightener works. Period. I have curly hair that is fine but very frizzy. The straightener straightens my hair in about 10-12 minutes and it stays straight for days, plus it totally gets rid of any frizz. Well, unless I&#x27;m standing right out in the rain. But if it&#x27;s just humid out, no problem.</li>
    <li> I was originally going to go with a more expensive salon brand, but decided to try this one out after reading all the positive reviews about it. So far, I am really satisfied!    Prior to purchasing this one, I had actually borrowed my friend&#x27;s HAI 2, which I think had cost over $100... and wow, sooo not worth it. That iron actually made my hair frizz up like crazy!    This one straightens super fast and nicely. No frizz :]    Note: I have fine hair that is mostly straight, EXCEPT for one side that is strangely wavy and annoyingly doesn&#x27;t straighten out even after lots of blow-drying. I had tried a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straightener I had bought from Japan (which was actually more expensive than this one!) and it totally didn&#x27;t do anything. I think it had something to do with the plates. So after doing some research about ceramic vs. tourmaline, it was obvious that tourmaline was the way to go, so I was very happy to find this as a very affordable option! There&#x27;s also a 4-year warranty which is nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a straightener that started smoking while in use!  This straightener is wonderful and works just as well as my friend&#x27;s pricey salon quality straightener.  I previously owned a Remington straightener and had gotten rid of it, a mistake I will not make again.  My only caveat is that if you have bangs, you may want to go with the one inch size b/c the two inch is too large to straighten bangs effectively.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed by this hair straightener.  I decided to give it a try after my expensive salon-quality straightener died after 2 years.  I figured so many great reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong, and I was right!  This thing is amazing!  It works just as well as my expensive one and keeps my hair straight and smooth all day.  I would recommend this hair straightener to anyone.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many straighteners but this one seems to do a very good job. The only flaw is my hand keep hitting the settings and thereby changing it.  Other than that, I have had no major problems. My hair lasts for weeks after using this straightener (my hair is somewhat straight already). I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This straightener works really great on long hair and it helps the whole straightening process go much faster. The only down side is it&#x27;s too big to get the little odds n ends and to really make your bangs look naturally straight. But other than that, it&#x27;s great :)</li>
    <li> I loved everything about this hair straighter. I purchased this in 2008 and it lasted until this past week (October 2013). I feel that is a very good lifespan for a product. It worked like new everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I have never gotten my hair straighter-even when I pay someone else to do it!!!!  I have tried several of the hair straightner sprays with it and all of them seem to work well.  My hair is no longer frizzy every time I try to striaghten it.  I have curly/wavy hair that gets very frizzy when I have tried to straighten it in the past, not ANYMORE.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I replaced my straightener which fell apart after only 8 months of use, with this Remington TStudio straightener.  I absolutely love it.  I have rather thick hair, but that&#x27;s not a problem with this straightener.  It leaves my hair very soft, not course and burnt feeling.  And it takes me about half the time to straighten my hair than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s straightener died about 2 days ago, and she asked if she could use mine.  Afterwards, she also remarked at how fast she could straighten her hair.  So, I have a 2nd one on it&#x27;s way for my daughter, who will be able to sleep in a little longer before school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very sturdy, the temp is high enough for any type of hair, yet it leaves your hair soft and silky, not course like you fried it.  It is wide enough so you can get the job done quicker.  There&#x27;s nothing on here to grab strands of hair and pull them out while straightening.  It heats up very fast, and will automatically shut off after an hour if you forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned on many counts.</li>
    <li> I would use this flat iron once and my hair would stay straight for 4 days.  I have very curly hair that is difficult to straighten.  I highly recommend this flat iron because it is cheap and it works great.</li>
    <li> Great Straightener at a great price. Got this at Christmas for my daughter who has very long thick healthy hair with a lot of body and waves. This flat iron does the trick very well without pulling and breaking the hair like most irons do. I love it too! And the price is way affordable...have you seen some of the prices of these??? BTW, I have used the expensive ones and really think I prefer this one. Like I said, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out!</li>
    <li> I have medium/long hair with a slight bit of wave to it.  My hair is fine but I have a lot of it.  Although my hair stylist has used a straightener on my hair before, I&#x27;ve never owned one or used one myself.  After researching the various brands and features for a while, I decided to take the plunge and give this one a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  I like the digital readout, and the controls are easy enough.  I also like that it heats up quickly.  I know I have nothing to compare it to but, I love this straightener!  I use TIGI BedHead Control Freak Serum with the straightener, which my hair stylist recommended and is also available at Amazon.  The combination of the serum and the straightener really does keep my hair straight.  (I went to an outdoor party last weekend.  It was very hot so the host turned on the misters to cool us off.  Even being in direct contact with the damp air, my hair was not affected at all.  Without the use of these products, my hair normally would have turned wavy and/or frizzy and limp and would have lost the style immediately.)  I&#x27;m definitely sold on straighteners; this one specifically is great, especially considering the price.  I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase it before now.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this and likes it.  Her comment is, that for the price, it is an excellent value.  She would prefer something a little thinner but is pleased with the Remington.</li>
    <li> Excellent iron, leaves hair with a shine and very silky, not mistreat the hair shaft.</li>
    <li> It does straighten my hair but catches on something and pulls it. Other than that it is fine. I do like the larger area too.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron, and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it. I like the digital temperature readout, and it heats up in less than 2 minutes.  I also like the size - 2 1/4 inch is perfect for my medium/long length hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t like - and I&#x27;m not sure if this happens with all flat irons or just this brand - is that if I brush the section of hair that I just used the flat iron on, then my hair gets major static cling!  It will go down right away, but it just caught me off guard the first time it happened.  Other than that - I love it.  Another tip - I intended to buy this flat iron from Amazon, but found it at the Ulta store on sale for $29.99 and also had a 20% off coupon from the Sunday ads in the paper, so I got it for about $23.00 including tax.</li>
