<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It is Dead Sea salt, alright. It isn&#x27;t white. It dissolves much more quickly than regular epsom salts. Is it magic? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m willing to shell out extra just in case! Once in awhile. You have to treat yourself well, and a good, hot, mineral salt bath is one good way to do it!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used any salts to bathe in. I have psoriasis and this definitely helps with clearing me up. Used in conjunction with other products makes it even better.</li>
    <li> do not like bag what the epsom salt in it will not reseal</li>
    <li> Just received it.. Should work will for what I&#x27;m using it for</li>
    <li> Good buy..great stuff..can afford to over do it</li>
    <li> Purchased 10lb bag a few months ago and I still have a big bag left. It is fantastic and I&#x27;m very glad to find this in such bulk at an affordable rate. I add a few drops of essential oils to a small cup of this before taking a bath and it is great especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, and I like the 10-lb bag! I take a lot of baths, so I go through the 2-lb bags you can buy at drugstores really quickly. I wanted some bulk bath salt so I found this. I usually like to do a mixture of sea salt and Epsom salts in my bath, so that helps increase the economical-ness (?) of this expensive bag of salt, haha. Dead Sea salt supposedly has a higher mineral content and is more therapeutic. Overall, it&#x27;s really nice, relaxing, and makes my skin feel soft, but I probably will just stick to regular old Epsom salts for everyday. These are nice for a treat but the difference in soaking is not that noticeable than with the cheaper stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My husband and I have had skin issues over the years..his is itchy skin with breakouts, mine is dry skin.  After two soaks my whole body is less dry. My husband, after one soak, said, &amp;#34;you know how nothing works for me, well, this works. My skin feels great!&amp;#34; A must have for all!!</li>
    <li> Love this dead sea salt. The best yet. I&#x27;ve purchased a few ten pound bags already. It really helps with any dry skin disorder. Makes your skin super soft. No need for lotion after a bath in this. Awesome product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this in my acne soap product and it is perfect :)Thanks!</li>
    <li> I knew I had ordered ten pounds of Dead Sea Salt.  But when it arrived, I was like, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s a big bag a salt!&amp;#34;  I put a couple of handfuls in my bath and it was an &amp;#34;aaaahhhhh&amp;#34; moment.  Helps with my sore muscles and makes my sink feel very nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect although I wish I would have ordered the ultra fine. It would have worked better for scrub I was making.</li>
    <li> I use it in the bath and it&#x27;s wonderful for your skin!!! I would recommend Dead Sea Salts for anybody with skin issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my six-year-old.  She had some warts and I tried everything besides aggressive measures to get rid of them.  I started giving her sea salt baths after some research and to my wonder they started falling off!  Best thing ever!  This product came in a sturdy bag and a free sample of one of their other products, which I thought was pretty awesome, not a lot of people do that.  Overall, would recommend to anyone who has skin ailments from warts to eczema and beyond!</li>
    <li> excellent bathing salt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Dead Sea salt from another vendor for several years, I thought salt is salt.  But that isn&#x27;t true. This salt is far superior to the other brand.  I really don&#x27;t know why except, that after soaking in a hot tub with 1/2 cup of this I am totally relaxed and ready to go to sleep.  It also softens your skin, I no longer have to use moisturizer on my elbows and knees.  I tried an experiment of just soaking in the tub and not using any soap or bath products, and after about ten minutes you can actually see the bath water turn a little cloudy, I like to think that what I am seeing in the water is toxins that have been removed because of the Dead Sea salt. I love this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Good quality ... Good price</li>
    <li> good to buy in bulk for sea salt baths, for health benefit</li>
    <li> This is the only natural product which give me relief of then medicines that cause liver snd kidney problems. It&#x27;s relief don&#x27;t last as long as the meds but i&#x27;ll live alot longer.</li>
    <li> I have had intractable psoriasis since I was in fourth grade. Doctors have tried literally everything from cortisoids to anti skin cancer drugs. The only things that have ever remotely touched my psoriasis is coal tar which is highly effective but a carcinogen, UV treatments, and high powered antibiotics since guttate psoriasis is often related to being a staph or strep bacteria carrier and being unable to get rid of it. Each of these treatments has only been partially effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Mineral Dead Sea Salt Bulk 10 lb bag after having tried some of the dead sea salts while at my mothers house. Within a week my psoriasis is nearly entirely clear in some spots and the plaques are no longer as dry and itchy .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being said I also would not recommend using this more than the 3x recommended per week for psoriasis if you normally have dry sensitive skin. The main reason for this is it is a salt product and salt can cause drying and irritation especially for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for people with psoriasis even if you have found a prescription treatment that works since it does help reduce the itching that occurs while plaques are healing or at the beginnings of new outbreaks. Good Product!</li>
    <li> Great product - I order it regularly!</li>
    <li> Great product...nice to order a big (heavy) bag and have it delivered to my door!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Big bag.</li>
    <li> Trying natural methods to get chemical absorption.</li>
    <li> My stubborn eczema finally went away after bathing with these salts each night for about a week.I tried EVERYTHING,including nasty steroids and I itched for over a year.They have no scent,and you dont even know they are in the bath,except for how you feel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Very good value.  If you are looking for scented bath salt, the cheap way to get it is to order this product and add essential oils yourself.  You will like the value and the quality of the scent you get this way.</li>
    <li> I returned this product after one use. It does not work for me at all. No effect whatsoever. Someone at my job even joked that I should be careful that I&#x27;m not getting table-salt or something mimicking the true product. I even asked the opinion on an expert, and they said I should have never even considered buying it. Will trying elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helped with treating dry skin. Easy to use. Nice body scrub. Realieves itchy skin in the winter time,</li>
    <li> A great way to relax in the bath and to detox your skin as well. It dissolves nicely and has a light texture.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this on amazon, I purchased directly from manufacturer website. I enjoy using it in bath and add to shampoo and conditioner. I also mix it in with my facial wash and my acne has reduced greatly. I have mild adult acne, those big painful cysts along jaw line. Using this along with my high frequency facial machine work wonder!</li>
    <li> Works perfecty, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my daughters ezcema and peeled off all the old dead skin and left skin so soft AND RELIEVED</li>
    <li> What a difference this makes in softening the hard Arizona waters.  Great feel after a bath.</li>
    <li> This sea salt is perfect for a bath and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for salt baths. The price is right and even better when you buy more. I&#x27;m glad I found this.</li>
    <li> The zip-lock top is very hard to close completely, but I hope that it will become more reliable as the bag gradually empties.  I had not ever used &amp;#34;fine grain&amp;#34;ed salt before.  This dissolves very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item does not have a fragrance, which is one reason I purchased, so that it would not &#x27;clash&#x27; with my bubble bath.</li>
    <li> Dead Sea salt is almost a miracle healing treatment (for external use only!)  I gave some to other people, and they were very enthusiastic of its healing properties only.  Why is Dead Sea salt such a best-kept treatment?  It&#x27;s great for healing sores and skin irritations.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use for my young son who has some pretty bad eczema on his legs.  I&#x27;ve had him off a few things in his diet for some time and had seen some big improvements but there was always a slight pink to the skin and very rough dry skin.  I used this the first day it arrived in his bath and like magic his legs looked better the next day!  I am thrilled to say the least.  His legs have an even color and starting to feel smoother!  Everyone has a different recommendation for their eczema situation, this is now mine.  I know it may not work for everyone, but it was most definitely worth a try for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Second purchase ... still loving this salt.  I do believe this is helping to keep my son&#x27;s skin pretty clear, I haven&#x27;t had to use any more medicated lotions or anything.</li>
    <li> It helps for a good soak in the tub.  Also helps my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> My physician suggested salt water baths and I have been very pleased using this salt.  It is truly fine grained.</li>
    <li> I am not a big bath taker but I tried these salts as a scrub in the shower.  They took away the dead skin and left me feeling soft and refreshed.  It works especially well on my feet.  I have only used them in the cold months so far, but I look forward to trying them this summer.  It feels soothing and I always rest better after using them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put some in my daughter&#x27;s bath.  She is 21 months has eczema and this really helps to keep her skin clear.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered this salt and I like using in the bath, great for relaxing and detoxing. Will keep on purchasing!</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow...I am 25 yrs old and  have severe guttate psoriasis (EVERYWHERE except my face) and I&#x27;ve been itching uncontrollably since August 2013 (and keeps getting worse). I have taken prescription creams, foams, and am soon starting Stelara next week.  I literally took a 10 minute bath before work today and its crazy how much of a difference I notice...from 1 bath!  The bumps are drying up and the itching is not as intense. I can only imagine what will happen after 2 weeks! Thank you sooo much!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this as a foot soak for his psoriasis. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s salt. I&#x27;m not sure wether I could tell the difference between different salts or not but it is great for a soak in the bath!</li>
    <li> Upon first opening this, I was wafted with an unusual aroma.....the ocean.  This was very strange to me because most other salt has absolutely no aroma at all or has an incredibly fake pungent smell.  What is this smell? It&#x27;s the high concentration of minerals that are in the Dead Sea that gives this salt a unique aroma that elevates the bathing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be completely honest, I thought that soaking in salt was a complete joke.  I have finished P90X, Insanity, and now I am starting P90X2.  As anyone who has done those programs knows, your body becomes very very sore!!  When I got this salt, I did not think it would work and I went into the experience expecting it not to work.  After soaking for 20 minutes in a hot bath.....I WAS WRONG!!! It honestly feels like a different type of bath.  For me, it felt like the water was penetrating my skin and soothing my muscles.  It was the greatest feeling and immediately afterwards, I went into my bed and fell asleep.  I awoke pleasantly in the morning to significantly less muscle fatigue.  While this is not something that one would use every day, for those days where every muscle in your body hurts, this is an amazing remedy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This salt contains natural ingredients such as:&lt;br /&gt;-Magnesium&lt;br /&gt;-Bromide&lt;br /&gt;-Iodine&lt;br /&gt;-Potassium&lt;br /&gt;-Sulfur&lt;br /&gt;-Calcium&lt;br /&gt;-Sodium&lt;br /&gt;-Zinc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is known to be a great remedy for psoriasis!!</li>
    <li> Great for soaking in the tub.  It really works to relax your aching muscles. I have severe arthritis &amp; this will relieve my aches &amp; pains for a few hours.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The salt is good stuff---just what was described as, and is very helpful for detoxing.&lt;br /&gt;You will be glad you got it.</li>
    <li> I love this salt! Perfect for my bath bombs and bath salts that I make to sell at my etsy shop. I love knowing that I&#x27;m using high quality sea salt for my products and it&#x27;s affordable! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely enjoy my warm baths with the Dead Sea Salts! I add 10 drops of lavender essential oil and some epsom salt. I feel so relaxed and rejuvenated after my bath. I highly recommend this product imported from Israel. Thank you San Francisco Bath Salt Company. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it in bath &amp; body products. It makes a big difference in the quality of the product. Fast shipping and perfect for my needs--thank you.</li>
    <li> We use Dead Sea Mineral Salt for our hot tub (which uses a chlorine generator to convert salt to chlorine then back to salt again--awesome system).  Anyway, I decided to search on Amazon.com after spending $20 on a 3.5 lb bag of &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; Dead Sea Mineral Salt and found this product, which is identical in mineral make-up to the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; bag I purchased previously and got 10 lbs for virtually the same price as I had paid for the tiny 3.5 lb &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; bag.  I also use this when I take a bath, it just makes me feel wonderful!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent for the shower.  Buy bulk and save $$.  Plus your skin will thank you</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product!</li>
    <li> I use these in my therapy tub that has a variety of air and water jets. The combination of the soothing salts with the motion of the water creates a very relaxing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This addendum to my review in no way changes the quality of the product. However, I have had to quit using the salts in my therapy tub. After I noticed a gritty buildup on the walls of the tub, I re-read the instructions for the tub and discovered that it is not safe for the tub&#x27;s finish to use salts in the bath. Bummer! I really enjoyed using the salt but don&#x27;t want to damage my tub.</li>
    <li> I love this salt. I use 2/3 c in my kids bath balanced with 1cup Sodium Bicarbonate (baking Soda). It helps relax their bodies for a better nights sleep. I dissolve it (1 cup distilled water to 1 cup Dead Sea salts with a little bit of pink Himalayan sea salt) then apply a little to my skin post work out to help with a quick recovery and sore muscles.  I mix with oil to make to make a salt scrub. It is fantastic, healing, soothing and versatile! For recipes look on Pinterest.</li>
    <li> Great product and the price is right. I use this to make salt/oil scrubs.</li>
    <li> This has not done anything for head psoriasis or my husbands spots.  But all the plaque psoriasis I had on my body, gone, in one sitting.  We have not had the greatest luck with other dead sea products, that may ease discomfort.  But to step into the bath, have all the spots disappear and never come back after 6 months, so very worth it.  Along with all the other benefits a salt bath gives and the excellent price, this is the first place I would check to get dead sea salts.</li>
    <li> I had a couple friends wanting to try the dead sea salt to help with skin boils and psoriasis so I had them test it out and they l love it. My friend with psoriasis soaks in the tub and said she feels like she is relaxing in the ocean. Her skin is more smooth and less itchy and painful after each use. My other friend who has boils, mixes a small amount and sponges her underarms where she frequently has boils and they are almost completely healed. As long as she continues to use it no new ones appear.</li>
    <li> I used to have to use Ciclopirox shampoo 2-3 times a week to control my flaking and itchy scalp.  Now I add a 16oz cup full of salt to a bath once or twice a week.  It works better than the shampoo and costs less.  It took 3 baths the first week to get things under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used to have very dry skin on my forehead.  I make a paste out a small handful and spread on my face once a week as well.  Its been a decade or more since my skin looked or felt this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  My mother has the same issue with her scalp.  I sent her a bag and she no longer needs any medication.  I also lent some to a family friend whose daughter was having a rash all over her leg.  Their dermatologist wasn&#x27;t sure what it was and the medication provided wasn&#x27;t helping.  She now uses dead sea salt.  Problem solved.</li>
    <li> Has helped a great deal with some sensitive skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product. Will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Baths are great, and this salt makes one even better. Buying in bulk saves a little money over buying similar salts at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective treatment I have found for my psoriasis!!!!! Very soothing. Does not smell and easily dissolves in the water. Most importantly it works!! I have ordered the product again, this time in the largest size!</li>
    <li> Got it to treat my daughters eczema. We didn&#x27;t have the results I&#x27;d hoped for. I noticed when we went to the beach, it improved greatly, so I hoped the sea salt would have a similar effect. Great price on it tho.</li>
    <li> Great value and am using for an ingredient in a soaking bath recipe to detox.</li>
    <li> This salt is amazing! It left me feeling revived and my skin felt so soft after the soak. I would highly recommend for general use.</li>
    <li> I use these salts in the tub once a week to soak for 30 minutes to let the magnisium soak into my body. It really makes one feel wonderful and relaxed.</li>
    <li> I love soaking with Dead Sea Salt. After getting out my skin feels so soft. Its a big bag and a great price.</li>
    <li> Great makes skin soft</li>
    <li> Great product. Recieved very quickly. I would highly recommend everyone to have some Dead Sea Salt in the house. I used to use Epsom Salt all the time but now I know the difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the epsom salts from this same company which are great for relaxing your muscles.. this dead sea salt has a bit of an odor to it, and leaves your skin feeling very smooth.  It does not seem to provide the relaxation of muscles like the epsom salt does (for me, at least), but my skin feels great after using this.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Dissolves really well.  I pour about a cupful into my bath, especially after running, add some lavender oil, get the bath super hot and it&#x27;s just heaven. I don&#x27;t know if it makes a difference but supposedly it does. The bath makes me feel awesome afterwards so maybe the salt is doing its job.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it both as a bath soak and a facial scrub mixed with coconut oil. This company has all the certifications so I know I&#x27;m getting real Dead Sea Salt unlike other &amp;#34;Dead Sea Salts&amp;#34; I have ordered. The product has a few small impurities but that is to be expected and not a problem. The small grain salt works perfectly for a facial scrub and leaves your skin very soft and glowing. The smell of the salts is appropriate to a mineral salt and not offensive. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! The best way to buy it too! I was paying 16 dollars for a little jar, this is the way to go. :)</li>
    <li> Top quality product, you might need a little scoop to decant the salt from the bag ....but otherwise it&#x27;s super</li>
    <li> I love this salt. With Prime shipping, you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really high quality product. Packed so full of minerals you can smell it when you open the bag.</li>
    <li> I was born with the wretched skin allergy, Eczema and stopped using topical steroids. This dead sea salt really helped alleviate the red irritation and oozing sometimes caused by scratching my rashes.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. first of all the effects on the body described  here does not do it justice. I am nurse and I have 2 teens who play football. I work in cardiology, so anything to do with circulation I know about it. This product  more than delivers, when it comes to circulation. It&#x27;s like hundreds of circulation pumps working on your body at the same time. My heart was beating faster ( Do not use very hot water.) it opens your pores, rids off toxins it gets rid of excess water too.Very good for anyone with water retention issues too. My skin felt smooth afterwards 2 days later! My sons are always sore after workout. they tried it, he says it beats sitting in a tub of ice! my sons  used it all in  2 days. So i ordered another one for me this time 40lbs bag. Definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to relax and fall asleep after. worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I love how soft it makes my skin feel after a long soak in the tub. I&#x27;ve never tried any sort of Dead Sea salt soak and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dead Sea Mineral Salt was better than what I&#x27;ve found in retail stores so far.  With the hard water in our home, it is difficult to take a bath without feeling like I have dry skin and a residue left on my skin afterward.  The mineral salt completely eliminated those sensations. It was also worked particularly well with my own essential oils.  While I&#x27;m not sure of the whole chemistry aspect of it, I found that the oils diffused more readily into the water.  The size of the bag was nice as well, as I got several uses out of it.  I would definitely purchase this product in the future with no qualms whatsoever..</li>
    <li> Going to use this to make my own essential oil bath salt.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, just as advertized, very pure and right grain size. Highly recommend and can be used very many differnt uses.</li>
    <li> Best bath salts ever but note you will get a tons so make sure you have the storage! I will buy again once I go through all of this.</li>
    <li> I went to a very expensive day spa and they recommended dead sea salts to remove the toxins from your body.  I went on Amazon and found a larger amount for a lot less money!  I must say that my skin was so much softer and I was so relaxed after my bath.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my alternative doctor,I have been very pleased with this product. Ease of use,quality product produces lasting relief of everyday aches and pains and provides a relaxing end to a productive day. Try it!</li>
    <li> I suffer from Fibromyalgia.  I love taking warm baths on days I am feeling sore and achy.  I am happy with this product and highly recommend it to any one wanting a natural way to deal with this pain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what they say it is. Have used this a lot for scalp issues (Seborreic Dermatitus). It does not, &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; the condition. Can&#x27;t say it even helps it in any significant or measurable fashion. It can be an alternative to shampoos and all the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; they contain but I would suggest it may not be in your best interests to use this every day as I have seen my hair become more dry with increased fall-out but that can be age, season and condition related; not sure. I&#x27;m not a fan of the packaging as its just a thicker baggie type thing with the line inside the groove sealing which is a minor inconvenience. If you do keep and use this in your shower area, make sure to seal the bag as the salt will clump up due to moisture in the room. I&#x27;ve used two products like this. They seem to be the same.</li>
    <li> Tried it for psoriasis. Has not helped until now.I guess it takes a long time for  psoriasis to heal with this.</li>
    <li> High quality clean bathing salt. My skin enjoys a healing warm bath with Dead Sea salt before bed. Relieves muscle aches of old age. Strong packaging, resealable bag, very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This salt has been a blessing; I suffer from CFS and FM and after a soak in these healing salts my muscle pain is less intense.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great quantity. The salt seems to do just as well as other more expensive brands, but I have to say it has a weird milky color unlike normal salts and has a strange chemical odor. I have to use more fragrance oils to cover up the odor but otherwise it is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Love it! I add baking soda and lavender oil for a nice bath.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for your skin.  Make sure you use the right amount.. Just bought another 20 lbs.  Amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as I am a regular epsom salt bather. But these dead sea mineral salts are great! Not only due they relieve aches,and inflammation but its great for my skin too. I couldn&#x27;t believe how my acne cleared up and my skin felt so soft and moisturized after a salt bath. I did some research on it it and I guess its because it has so many minerals it it that our skin needs. Anyways, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 10/27/14&lt;br /&gt;Just reordered my 3rd bag, decided to go for the 20lbs. My poor postman. I&#x27;M ADDICTED!</li>
    <li> I should have been smart enough to realize that DEAD SEA salt does not come from San Francisco...  not the same.  If the price seems too good to be true... don&#x27;t be an idiot.  Investigate further.</li>
    <li> Really good for soaking in a warm bath.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cure the severe eczema of my daughter or husband as we hoped - not even much relief - BUT, it seemed to be a quality product, made our bathroom smell &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34;, and we think it provided some relief and healthy mineral absorption.  We bought the 20lb bag (fine grain) and used it with our jetted tub without any issue.  Do follow the distributor&#x27;s instructions of 20 minute baths in room temperature water followed by a regular water rinse.  The instructions will not be on the packaging, but I found it repeatedly in the reviews.  We do plan to order this product again.</li>
    <li> LOVE! I&#x27;m on my 4th 10 pound bag.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> The salt was perctly packaged, came before my expected delivery date and the quality was supreme. Thankfully the dead sea salt has a long shelf life because I ordered a larger quantity due to lower pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied and would highly recommend the product and company.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! So soothing in a bath</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It physically doesn&#x27;t seem to have any better benefits than regular Epsom salts, but , I figure with the added minerals this is suppose to have, that it should be more beneficial, even if the immediate results are not noticeable.</li>
    <li> Package arrived in good shape.  Salts dissolved very quickly.  Time will tell if the salts perform as reported on so many web sites.</li>
    <li> I loved washing my hands with this! I would just take a little scoop a rub! Like having a mini manicure my hands were sooo soft</li>
    <li> I take salt baths to calm down my sensitive skin. Seems to work well and they are good quality salts, but a little more than I&#x27;d like to pay on a regular basis. I found some dead sea salts at a local natural foods store that are much cheaper so I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, great for relaxing and detoxing!</li>
    <li> I really like these salts - especially if you have any dermatology issues</li>
    <li> I absolutely love San Francisco Salt company I use them for all of my bulk salts for my company. They ship very fast with very reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> Great product and value!! Would purchase again for sure - gotta love the price - very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> This may be a good product for somebody, especially if one has psoriasis. But not for me. With my sensitive, dry skin with atopic features and easy exsema break out, it was too irritation, and actually made me itch worse</li>
    <li> Did you know that the Dead Sea actually has 31% salts? Because there is no outlet to the Dead Sea, over time, the mineral content has become very high, which has resulted in a minimum of life - thus its name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these same minerals have been attributed to do \\&quot;good things.\\&quot; Long before modern times it was used to soak for arthritis and other ailments. Because of the high content of magnesium chloride, it functions in many ways the same as an Epsom Salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t swear by Dead Sea Salts - but if you are looking for certified Dead Sea Salts, these actually come with certification that they are actually from the Dead Sea, the mineral content, and are fine grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a complementary sample to test in my own bath water, and found it to be mineral smelling and a bit \\&quot;earthy.\\&quot; Just the kind of salt you would expect. While I personally preferred some of the other bath salts, these dissolved easily in the bath water and provided a nice \\&quot;spa\\&quot; experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a bit of a thrill for me, a pastor, to soak in these particular salts from Israel. Nonetheless, I personally will be sticking to the Muscle Soak Bath Salts 2 Lbs which have a hint of Eucalyptus and Peppermint ... We all have our loves ...</li>
    <li> Using the salts 3 times a week helped to calm my psoriasis. I also had some other itchy spots that started from a detergent I used. Soaking in the sea salts helped to heal those spots faster than when I used a steroid cream. Will definitely reorder these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the two-pound bag of fine-grained Dead Sea salt. Since my wife and I scuba-dived for twenty-five years, I was already a firm believer in the benefits of bathing in ocean water. I&#x27;ve read about the alleged therapeutic benefits of bathing in the Dead Sea, and when I searched online, I found that the water of the Dead Sea has 29% salt content, compared to 4% in the oceans. Its mineral composition is also different from ocean water, since only 12-18% of Dead Sea salt is sodium chloride; by comparison, 97% of the salt in normal ocean water is sodium chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, you&#x27;d have to add a lot of Dead Sea salt to your bath water to duplicate the concentration of salt in the Dead Sea. But adding a lesser amount does allow you to duplicate the various minerals found in the Dead Sea waters. I dissolved about a half-pound of the salt in a tub of warm bathwater and had a very pleasant, relaxing bath. I did this two nights in a row, and I enjoyed it very much, especially since I usually take showers instead of tub baths. I also tried a foot bath by dissolving about a quarter-cup of the Dead Sea salt in a basin filled with warm water, and my feet felt great afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to what I researched online, the minerals in Dead Sea salt are absorbed while soaking, stimulating blood circulation and helping to detoxify the body. Based on my limited use of the salts so far, I can&#x27;t positively confirm that, but the results are certainly promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer provided a product sample to evaluate and review.</li>
    <li> I use this for my Psoriasis.  I think it helps along with my medication.  Other than that,. it makes my skin extremely soft.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this, I put it in my bath with couple drops of essential oils.  Great for body detox and relax.</li>
    <li> lovely in the bath; my natural health person told me how relaxing and therapeutic this would be before bed, and really she was right! I have run out, and intend to go and order more tonigiht! It lasted me for several months. I could not find this locally at all. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> says fine grain but is coarse</li>
    <li> What can I say other than these salts are wonderful. I love a bath. The salts have no scent so I add a touch of essential oil. Heaven!!!</li>
    <li> I was afraid it would smell odd but it hardly has any odor at all.  The fine might be too abrasive for some so if you are making body polish might go with extra fine.  If you have a scratch or cut this will sting but it is probably good for it!</li>
    <li> Love the price and quantity. Great for baths and soaking your feet. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I like this salt for soaking tired feet.  I&#x27;ve also found that it helps my eczema.  A big plus is that you can buy it in bulk which helps reduce the price when you&#x27;re using it daily.</li>
    <li> I have been going through topical steroid withdrawal and have used these bath salts after going through tubs of epsom salts and other dead sea products.  My immune system is extremely sensitive right now, and the purity of this product is why I ordered it.  (I don&#x27;t need or want any scents or additional ingredients.)  I think these baths have helped my detox process and the price made it well worth it.</li>
    <li> According to International Law the occupying country is forbidden from exploiting resources of occupied territory. israel is exploiting these salts, minerals, and muds from the Palestinian Areas, and on top of this israel prevents Palestinians from visiting or benefiting from the Dead Sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information please check this report of B&#x27;Tselem (the israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories): [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could also watch this video on israel&#x27;s violations of the International Law:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your time reading my review.</li>
    <li> These salts feel great in our hot tub and we love the way it makes our skin feel, but note that the salts contain very little sodium chloride which is what you are supposed to use with a chlorine generator.  Our solution is to use a mixture of 2/3 Dead Sea Salt and 1/3 plain pool grade sodium chloride.</li>
    <li> I use it in my hot tub.  The fine grain is much easier to dissolve; nice product.  Will look for again.</li>
    <li> I am going to purchase this product because I love soaking in the tub.  But would love to see it offered as \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot;!  I personally like that option on things I purchase regularly from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like Epsom salt baths and usually notice a slight benefit. I tried these salts hoping for more. I am a &amp;#34;have to feel the results&amp;#34; kind of person and I really don&#x27;t feel that much different over Epsom salts after getting half-way through the bag. And for this price point, I&#x27;ll have to weigh whether the price is worth it when I need to restock my salt supply.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, excellent price, I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> good if you really need dead sea salt</li>
    <li> It really makes the water soft and perfect for generating chlorine automatically. with a generator.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> When I was asked to review a couple of samples of bath salts, I declined because I prefer showers, but changed my mind when I was told I could use the salts as a scrub in the shower. I am not a fan of heavily scented bath products and Minera Dead Sea Salt is completely fragrance-free. In the shower, I have used it as a scrub and also to massage into the bottom of my feet to soothe and soften them. I have noticed that an itchy skin tag has gotten smaller and doesn&#x27;t itch when I rub a small amount of the salt into it every few days - an interesting side benefit. Although it is marked as fine, the salt is somewhat coarse, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it on my face or sensitive skin areas right out of the bag, but as an occasional scrub, it leaves the skin feeling soft and refreshed. The only ingredient is Dead Sea salt from Israel. I like!!!</li>
    <li> With prime, this is a great deal for genuine sea salts.  One can buy a huge bag and make gifts, use it for baths, use it for facials, it really can be used for endless things.  Dead sea salts are such a restorative, using these twice/ three times a week can really do wonders for the skin, and the fine grain is actually a perfect size for facial use.  Love it. will definitely reorder when we run low.</li>
    <li> I hate this product I would never buy it again or any other products from this company. The product is not from the dead sea in my opinion. I have used dead sea products for years and I am 99% sure this is not a dead sea product.</li>
    <li> Gathering products for a special project, and haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it came exactly as shown.  Pleased with product so far.</li>
    <li> Ordered mineral dead sea salt in the 10lb bulk bag. Makes my skin super soft, noticed right away. speedy shipping</li>
    <li> I used this Dead Sea Salt to make bath salts for Christmas gifts. I received excellent feedback on the salts from my family and friends that received them. I am a soap, salve, and lip balm maker. These salts were such a hit that I am considering adding them to my product line.</li>
    <li> Well packaged. Great quality. Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very few things are more relaxing than a salt bath from NATURAL salts from the earth.</li>
    <li> This fine grain salt is very nice for soaking bath.  I mix it with equal part baking soda and find that it is quite restorative.  With a few drops of lavender oil it is heavenly.  This combination has helped with relaxing and seems to help move tension from the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned above, the fine grain is nice as it dissolves faster than large crystals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order arrives quickly in nice clean packaging.  We stand the bag in the room with a small disposable container for scooping.  It gets used often.</li>
    <li> Great product, great company.</li>
    <li> Very happy! I have psoriasis and use this to soak my hands and feet. It is very soothing. Exfoliation after soaking for 20 minutes or so is easier and faster. So is nail care, which can be difficult and painful with psoriatic nails. Salt does dry the skin but I counteract that quickly with a good moisturizer. It&#x27;s worth it to have the minerals specific to Dead Sea Salt soak into the skin and counteract psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I love taking baths in this salt! You notice a difference in the water instantly. I usually use about 1-2 cups of salt for each bath, and it is lasting a while.</li>
    <li> great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> The cheapest and most effective DSS I&#x27;ve found to date. I use this in my baths to keep my gnarly awful skin from getting infected as I withdraw from topical steroids. A cup goes a long way! Soothing, bouyant and cleansing. This would make a great gift, too. I know what my family is getting for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Best Bath Salt ever, I purchased this dead sea salt bulk for my brother he suffers with eczema on his legs and slightly on his hands and legs. He used to use steroid creams but this dead sea salt has been fantastic from first use, he has a incredible improvement in his condition.I recommended this bath salt also to my g-friend as she has mild dry skin all over. She has seen the benefits also. Great product, if you have any dry skin condition or I&#x27;ll order bulk again next time.</li>
    <li> So far I believe it works</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moNBV7XPX4DO7G]]The Dead Sea is a popular tourist attraction and it is well known for its therapeutic effect for people who bathe or swim there. It is highly concentrated in salt and other minerals and organic compounds. That is why it is used in spas and treatment centers around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten out of the habit of taking a long hot soaking bath to relax my muscles and back in favor of the faster shower. I started using these bath salts and I now realize that the baths help my joints and back a lot more and really relaxes my tight muscles. This Minera Dead Sea Salt from the San Francisco Bath Salt Company reminds me of how much I liked taking baths and of the therapeutic value of just relaxing in the tub. This salt is good for relaxing but it also is very good for resolving issues with psoriasis, eczema and acne. It helps to cleanse and detoxify your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salt quickly dissolves in warm or hot water and helps to relax stiff and sore muscles and relive your aches and pains. You put one pound of Dead Sea salt into a hot bath and then soak for 12 minutes or more. It is also great for soaking your tired feet after a long day of standing or walking a lot. For skin treatment it is recommended to use 2 pounds of salt in a warm bath and to relax for 20 minutes. Multiple treatments are necessary and it is recommended not to use very hot water for this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dead Sea salt is a product without any fragrance or oils added but it does contain 21 natural minerals that are good for your body. It is a fine grind of salt but it still quickly dissolves in your tub. You can put this salt in a bath to relax, for use to exfoliate your skin and feet and as a good soak to remove toxins. In today&#x27;s world we don&#x27;t take the time to relax and unwind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking in a tub with Dead Sea salt can relieve arthritis, muscle and nerve pain. Minerals can be absorbed into the skin and it is beneficial for you to detoxify your body. It is time to revitalize and pamper yourself with a nice relaxing and therapeutic salt bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have made a quick video of four different salts that I had the privilege to review for the San Francisco Salt company and I hope you take the time to watch it. I have listed the links to the other three products in the video for your information. My wife and I liked them all and I can tell you that our water bill is going up because of taking more baths instead of showers but it is well worth the time to relax and enjoy life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like you to know that I was supplied samples of these products and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.y.

    <li> I bought this because I was dying of itch from mosquito bites that had turned into little superficial sores after being viciously attacked outside of my home.  It worked miracles on those; the scabs fell away after a long bath with this stuff and the next morning I was itch-free.  I was hoping it would take care of some psoriasis type thing I&#x27;ve developed, and while that seems a bit better so far I&#x27;m still soaking it every night and hoping for the best.  Will update after a couple of weeks of consistent use for that.  In the process it has made my fingernails stronger and growing longer, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise... don&#x27;t.  Eat.  It.</li>
    <li> This is excellent salt from the DEAD SEA and I use it every day and I believe it helps me to stay well.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and is a great product. I am using it in my hair shampoo for a scrub and will see how it does.Great for bath also.</li>
    <li> Minera Dead Sea Salt from the San Francisco Bath Salt Company is all I&#x27;ve chosen to purchase for more than a year now. It is a bit on the pricy side, but it is also of high quality. I have purchased some unscented bath salt only to discover it had a medicine-like aroma. Minera does not. It truly is unscented. It dissolves rapidly in warm water and leaves no residue behind in the tub. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I use this salt to make sole and then take one tsp every evening to maintain good health,  it is the best salt that I have ever used.</li>
