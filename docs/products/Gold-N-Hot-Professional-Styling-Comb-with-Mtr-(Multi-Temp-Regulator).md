    <li> This comb does a very good job, and it heats in a reasonable time. The only negative is with prolonged use, the comb will decrease effectiveness due to product (hair gels, conditioners, sprays, etc.) buildup.  Product buildup is guaranteed because hair must be protected from the direct heat.  As with any heated styling implement, use with caution.</li>
    <li> I just brought this product and its such a disappointment. I only wanted it so that I can get to my roots in the front of my head, but the product doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough to do any real straightening. My hair is not course. Its just naturally curly so my roots can get wavy/curly and I need a little touch up to keep the sating straight look. Well this is not the product to do that. The heat is not hot at all maybe warm if that. When I first used I figured I would set it to 300 degrees so I don&#x27;t burn my hair and like I said I don&#x27;t need that much heat...but 300 degrees did nothing changed it to 400 after 5 minutes waited another 5 still did nothing. Finally I set it to 500 degrees and it was moderately warm but I needed to comb through my hair several times before I could see less wavy and even that wasn&#x27;t the straight I was looking for. I will be returning this tomorrow. Don&#x27;t waste your money keep looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this comb for may be 2 to 3 years now and I never had any issues using it or pressing my hair. I have hair texture 4a which is non-relaxed and this gets my roots and ends bones straight before a pressing with my flat iron. For any woman whose got all natural hair I recommend this electric pressing-comb. I tend to use it on 500 degrees to get my hair really straight but if I want less bone straight hair then I&#x27;d turn it down to 375-400 degrees. This pressing comb is a much better option to its direct heat version. This is reasonably priced also with no risk of a loss of hair due to the comb being too hot.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to these reviews.  I have the predecessor version of the Gold N Hot Professional Styling Comb which was HOT, easy to use and effective.  I lost that one traveling and ordered this one as a replacement.  Big mistake.  This comb is merely, at best, very warm. The electrical cord is a smaller in diameter cord which I imagine is part of the reason for the reduced heat; less electricity, less heat and my hair stays in its natural state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I needed a warm comb I would have just run a metal comb over a candle for a moment and then applied that to my hair; it would have been just as effective as this one.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THIS COMB FOR OVER 15YEARS, IT IS ONE OF THE BEST ON THE MARKET, I AM GETTING ANOTHER BECAUSE FINALLY THE HANDLE IS BREAKING, BUT THE COMB IS STILL WORKING GREATTTTTT, I USE THIS COMB ONCE A MONTH, REMEMBER I JUST SAID I HAVE HAD THIS COMB FOR OVER 15 YEARS, JUST LEARN HOW TO OPERATE THE COMB AND IT WILL PREFORM,I LOVE THIS COMB, DONT KNOW WHERE THE BAD REVIEWS IS COMING FROM BECAUSE THIS IS AN EXCELLENT TOOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store over ten years ago. And it gets hot enough for my thick coarse african-american hair @ 16. Now it&#x27;s all cracked up at the end of the handle but it still works. Looking for a new one.</li>
    <li> Did not heat up properly. Would not purchase this product. Trying to get refund now. Product labeling looked bogus as it were a knock off.</li>
    <li> I have used Gold N Hot for a number of years and I have never had any heating up issues. My last gold n hot electric comb lasted about 5 years because I burned the cord accidentally.  I have not worn chemicals in my hair for over 15 years and my hair texture is soft and thick naturally. It does not take much heat to straighten. I still prefer a hot comb to a flat iron any day but This particular iron does not get hot enough . You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> It is designed well having the stand attached to the comb and has multi-settings for the heat. But, one problem after a couple od uses, and I do mean a couple, like 2. The comb no longer gets hot and becomes completely useless. I am now throwing away my particularly new comb in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This comb was designed very well years ago before it had the \\&quot;Multi-Temp Regulator\\&quot; feature.  This particular feature does not maintain heat or its temperature at all! It cools off automatically when you start to press your hair, probably as a safety precaution to keep you from burning your hair. This would be good for some one with less kinky hair/thin hair or an inexperienced hotcomb user. But for people who know how to use one and know what temp to use on their own hair it&#x27;s no good. After I purchased this, I ended up using my stove top hotcomb because this was just not keeping the heat long enough for me to do my hair (not even for my edges).</li>
    <li> I love most hair tools/products from Gold n&#x27; Hot; however, this styling comb simply doesn&#x27;t get/stay hot enough to straighten my transitioning hair...even at the highest temperature.</li>
    <li> Does not get as hot as I would like. And takes a little longer to heat than it should. Had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> This works great for styling heat resistant wigs!!! Love it.</li>
    <li> I just bought this exact comb from a local store and let me tell you... I&#x27;m pissed. I paid 35 dollars for it. I used it on my daughter who is biracial and I usually use a stove top hot comb but I didn&#x27;t have it anymore. This comb hardly got hot. It was a waste of my money and 1 30 mins. She has fine to thick hair. and I could have just flat ironed it with out all the hassle. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gold N Hot for years so it worked out great except, unfortunately the teeth on this one tend to pull strands of my hair out.</li>
    <li> Siiiiiiiiggggghhhhh......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read these reviews before buying this at pro beauty. It is Luke warm at best.  Pun intended.  This thing barely gets warm.  Fingers crossed that I can return it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Not as hot as I thought it would be, but still a good product.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Terrible choice for a replacement comb, doesn&#x27;t get to desired heat.Tried on many different types of hair from a coarse natural to someone with &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34; and this combs performance was TERRIBLE a waste of money</li>
    <li> This hot comb actually works on my hair and its really thick. The one i have broke because of my roommate carelessness but I&#x27;m replacing it asap.</li>
    <li> the product did not get hot at all. kind of disappointed. Good price just not hot enough. not happy with purchase</li>
    <li> this product did not work well. My daughter &#x27;s hair was nowhere near straightened had to go over with a flat iron.  THe main reason i gave this hot comb a chance was because of the brand, which in the past did get very hot,..however this one only got warm i could literally pat it in my hand without burning myself.</li>
