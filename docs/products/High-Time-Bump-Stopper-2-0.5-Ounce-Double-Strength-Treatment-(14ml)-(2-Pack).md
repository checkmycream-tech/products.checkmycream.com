      <li>love it will use it again and again</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy It when I was in the Army</li>
      <li>so i gifted to a friend.</li>
      <li>The 2 blade won&#x27;t give you the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever had; it&#x27;s more of a beardreducer.</li>
      <li>Time to order more.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Was excited that it came with two for the price.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t remember where I originally bought it so turned here to find it.</li>
      <li>I use this with warm water and a new blade and have virtually eliminated all neck bumps.</li>
      <li>I used lots of different creams but this seems to be the best ever used so far.</li>
      <li>It says you&#x27;ll notice results in 48 hours and that was true.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
      <li>Aweek later, my skin looks better than it ever has since I started shaving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I started having to shave for work more often and an electric left way too much hair.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll see the hairs start sticking out which makes it extremely easy to cut with a traditional 2 blade razor.</li>
      <li>This really helps with those pesky bumps you get under your neck from shaving.</li>
      <li>To my surprise this product really worked for me.</li>
      <li>This thing really work and reduce the bumps.</li>
      <li>But let me tell you, it is so much easier on your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>Then, with a brand new disposable 2 blade (I use one each time I shave to guarantee its sharp and rust free), shave WITH the grain, never against, and be sure you&#x27;re applying even pressure and keeping the blade parallel to your skin.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work for me, bummed because I had high hopes.</li>
      <li>have very sensitive skin, hair that quite literally curls right back towards my skin, and also a very defined jawline (blame it on my Welsh ancestors).</li>
      <li>He says- can&#x27;t live without it and loves it.</li>
      <li>These new age, 4 and 5 blade razors just cut way too close for my type of skin, and were quite literally the reason I was getting hideous ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>Even for someone who has damn near perfect technique, these can cause really bad ingrowns.</li>
      <li>My husband has very sensitive skin and always gets a rash after shaving.</li>
      <li>first thing to prevent ingrown hairs is shaving properly.</li>
      <li>In combination with proper shaving technique and tools, Bump Stopper 2 quite literally put an end to some pretty hideous ingrown hairs I was getting on the sides of my chin and</li>
      <li>Only used it once and notice the bump was gone, it really works!</li>
      <li>Used up 3 bottles so far and it works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After that, I apply Bump Stopper 2 to my entire face and really massage it in.</li>
      <li>I purchased Nivea for Men Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream (New Formula), Bump Stopper 2, and a generic pack of 2 blade disposable razors.</li>
      <li>I had tried the Original Bump Stopper in the past and found that it worked some time.</li>
      <li>After applying this to an already VERY aggravated ingrown hair, almost overnight the thing had shrunk down.</li>

<li> Once I started using a traditional razor (Schick Hydro 5 to be exact), I started to get some pretty nasty ingrown hairs, and one that ballooned up to the size of a large marble.</li>
<li> Also, the little jar goes quite a long way even when applying to your entire face.</li>
<li> Shower, wash your face and neck and rub this stuff in and let it dry ever night and they are almost all gone when you wake up!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days</li>

<li> For someone who has dealt with terrible acne, and absolutely massive ingrown hairs, my skin is now 100% clear and looks better than ever.</li>
<li> NOT a magic cure, but if you get bumps this product does provide relief, if applied 2-3 times a day they actually keep the discomfort to a minimum and also seem to reduce the size of the bumps and the time you have them.</li>
<li> What you think is acne may be ingrown hairs due to these 4 and 5 blade</li>
<li> I put a little bit to cover the area and it feels a little cool/minty and eases the itch.</li>
<li> I use it everyday and every time I shave.  </li>

<li> Been using this product for a few months now.</li>
<li> After tons of research, trying products such as Prid (which didn&#x27;t do squat for me), and even having to work from home a few days due to how bad these ingrowns were, I changed my shaving routine, and included Bump Stopper 2.</li>
<li> We tend to order it from Amazon as very few stores carry it in our area.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t been disappointed so far.</li>
<li> I was very skeptical about this product having any effect, considering all other remedies tried before.</li>
<li> I tried using other crap</li>
<li> Razor bumps are the worst, especially you know where.</li>
<li> you&#x27;re looking to get rid of nasty ingrown hairs but still need a clos(er) shave, try my above technique and let me know how it works.</li>
<li> and i was desperate for relief</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why people have said it smells bad, there is ZERO smell.</li>
<li> Disappointed in the size of the product.</li>
<li> This product helps avoid those awful razor burn rashes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, it&#x27;s the only product ice found that works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days and I think it is working well.  It has definitely reduced the size of the bumps and ingrown hairs.  It says you&#x27;ll notice results in 48 hours and that was true.  I haven&#x27;t been disappointed so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast shipping :)</li>
    <li> This really helps with those pesky bumps you get under your neck from shaving. I use this with warm water and a new blade and have virtually eliminated all neck bumps.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and every time I shave.  Provides a great soothing relief from the irratation of shaving plus leaves my face feeling great!!</li>
    <li> Bump Stopper-2 is a great product. My husband has very sensitive skin and always gets a rash after shaving. This product helps avoid those awful razor burn rashes. We tend to order it from Amazon as very few stores carry it in our area.</li>
    <li> Not working as I thought,not Wat I wanted</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle product. It clears hyperpigmentation as if it were a prescription medication. Fantastic product. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years and trust me, it works!  I have always had issues with razor burn and bumps and this is the only product that helps.  It&#x27;s basically removed all the bumps and alleviates burn.  Cannot recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a few months now. Couldn&#x27;t remember where I originally bought it so turned here to find it. Was excited that it came with two for the price. Only thing I&#x27;ve found to work in keeping razor bumps under control.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this everytime he shaves. He is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Used up 3 bottles so far and it works. Razor bumps are the worst, especially you know where. I put a little bit to cover the area and it feels a little cool/minty and eases the itch.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything for me. No change in the razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product having any effect, considering all other remedies tried before. To my surprise this product really worked for me. I still can&#x27;t believe it. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> man do shaving bumps hurt. and i was desperate for relief thankfully i saw the good reviews on here about this product and i love it. bumps are gone and even sent a second bottle so i gifted to a friend.</li>
    <li> NOT a magic cure, but if you get bumps this product does provide relief, if applied 2-3 times a day they actually keep the discomfort to a minimum and also seem to reduce the size of the bumps and the time you have them. I will keep some around!</li>
    <li> got ride of my ingrowns and razor burn in only s few days.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product. Saw a few bumps after use. Wll continue using until I see results. Fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, bummed because I had high hopes. No change to my bikini bumps.</li>
    <li> In combination with proper shaving technique and tools, Bump Stopper 2 quite literally put an end to some pretty hideous ingrown hairs I was getting on the sides of my chin and jawline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, hair that quite literally curls right back towards my skin, and also a very defined jawline (blame it on my Welsh ancestors). I started having to shave for work more often and an electric left way too much hair. Once I started using a traditional razor (Schick Hydro 5 to be exact), I started to get some pretty nasty ingrown hairs, and one that ballooned up to the size of a large marble. After tons of research, trying products such as Prid (which didn&#x27;t do squat for me), and even having to work from home a few days due to how bad these ingrowns were, I changed my shaving routine, and included Bump Stopper 2. Aweek later, my skin looks better than it ever has since I started shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to prevent ingrown hairs is shaving properly. I purchased Nivea for Men Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream (New Formula), Bump Stopper 2, and a generic pack of 2 blade disposable razors. These new age, 4 and 5 blade razors just cut way too close for my type of skin, and were quite literally the reason I was getting hideous ingrown hairs. Even for someone who has damn near perfect technique, these can cause really bad ingrowns. What you think is acne may be ingrown hairs due to these 4 and 5 blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, lather up your face with tons of shaving cream. Here&#x27;s the trick - let it sit on your face for 3-5 minutes. You&#x27;ll see the hairs start sticking out which makes it extremely easy to cut with a traditional 2 blade razor. Then, with a brand new disposable 2 blade (I use one each time I shave to guarantee its sharp and rust free), shave WITH the grain, never against, and be sure you&#x27;re applying even pressure and keeping the blade parallel to your skin. The 2 blade won&#x27;t give you the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever had; it&#x27;s more of a beardreducer. But let me tell you, it is so much easier on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I apply Bump Stopper 2 to my entire face and really massage it in. I don&#x27;t know why people have said it smells bad, there is ZERO smell. Also, the little jar goes quite a long way even when applying to your entire face. After applying this to an already VERY aggravated ingrown hair, almost overnight the thing had shrunk down. One week later, you can&#x27;t even tell it is there. This stuff is absolutely amazing and does a great job moisturizing my skin as well - its not oily, doesn&#x27;t smell, and goes on very evenly. I had tried the Original Bump Stopper in the past and found that it worked some time. This stuff is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to get rid of nasty ingrown hairs but still need a clos(er) shave, try my above technique and let me know how it works. For someone who has dealt with terrible acne, and absolutely massive ingrown hairs, my skin is now 100% clear and looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best! I literally love this stuff! I used to be able to buy It when I was in the Army and then when I got out, I saw it at CVS or Walgreens and now NO ONE carries it anywhere! I tried using other crap that&#x27;s liquid and products but love this stuff! It works sooo well that My GF uses it on her legs and bikini line... (no beard or mustache LOL!)  I will literally buy all of these that I can and I hope the company doesn&#x27;t stop making this product! It literally works wonders!  Have bumps from shaving and a collier shirt rubbing on the shaved part of your neck? Shower, wash your face and neck and rub this stuff in and let it dry ever night and they are almost all gone when you wake up!</li>
    <li> He says- can&#x27;t live without it and loves it. Time to order more.</li>
    <li> love it will use it again and again</li>
    <li> Only used it once and notice the bump was gone, it really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and after a close shave I automatically apply this to ensure the ingrown hair and bumping that accompanies it, don&#x27;t set in.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the size of the product. Next time I will pay closer attention to the ounces!!</li>
    <li> This thing really work and reduce the bumps. I used lots of different creams but this seems to be the best ever used so far.</li>
    <li> Good product for Men, i have been ordering it for my husband . It works.</li>
    <li> My husband use this product. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s good because my husband like it.</li>
