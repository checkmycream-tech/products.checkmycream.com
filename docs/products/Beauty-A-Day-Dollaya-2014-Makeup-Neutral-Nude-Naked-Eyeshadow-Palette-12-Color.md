### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome product !</li>
      <li>She loved it!!!</li>
      <li>this is the perfect palette for you.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good makeup!</li>
      <li>Not all the colors were in the kit, but still has a lot of beautiful colors.</li>
      <li>It works great and looks beautiful</li>
      <li>very nicely packaged, sturdy, just what daughter wanted</li>
      <li>This is a good product was a great buy I liked all the colors</li>
      <li>They say things like,  \\&quot;It&#x27;s cheaper and looks good, so I don&#x27;t mind!\\&quot;    </li>
      <li>Does not cake up on eyes , blends beautifully , would like to see one more brush added to this product .</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a nice palette with good colors.</li>
      <li>I really love this!</li>
      <li>Nice palette by ODBO, (and that is what it says on top of the case).  </li>
      <li>and I have not been satisfied with my products.</li>
      <li>You may be settling for the cheaper price and satisfied with what you get, but you have no idea what&#x27;s in these products.</li>
      <li>My daughter uses this when she wears make-up, I&#x27;m happy to pay for it when she wears natural color in a flattering way.</li>
      <li>They come on easily and stay all day.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy, nicely packaged, just what daughter wanted</li>
      <li>Rethinking that right about now!</li>
      <li>There are reviews that say this is fake and not urban decay and even if that is true this is still a great product and it works fine and is a very good price.</li>
      <li>Dupes are made by reputable companies that bear their own names, like E.L.F., NYX, and all of these other companies that make their own version of these palettes WITHOUT claiming to be Urban Decay.    </li>
      <li>I love this I shadow palette because it has nice pic its a neutral color and everyday makeup.</li>
      <li>I understand that $54 is a little steep for an eye shadow palette, but if you want a cheaper knock-off version, then go the safe route and get it from a reputable brand.</li>
      <li>Spend your money on the real deal!</li>
      <li>Might as well keep it because it&#x27;ll cost more to send it back.</li>
      <li>The colors are lackluster, and are nothing more than a bunch of shimmers that don&#x27;t hold a candle to the real deal Urban Decay colors.    </li>
      <li>This pallet is the exact same thing as the naked 2 pallet only at a way better price!!</li>
      <li>Highly recomend !</li>
      <li>I am (as well as my daughter since it was a gift to her) very upset.</li>
      <li>Urban Decay and other reputable brands use ingredients approved by the FDA, and you know what you&#x27;re putting on your face and allowing to be absorbed into your body.</li>
      <li>Wished there was a few more colors</li>
      <li>If you want the real palette, I suggest buying the real one from urban decay.</li>
      <li>Legitimate companies make dupes all the time and they don&#x27;t claim to be Urban Decay or any brand they&#x27;re imitating, but they use FDA-approved products so you know exactly what you&#x27;re putting on your face.</li>
      <li>but it is a complete lie!</li>
      <li>If you, like me, like eyeshadows in natural colours</li>
      <li>These companies putting &#x27;Urban Decay&#x27; on their products are also claiming to use the same ingredients as Urban Decay uses, when you really have no idea</li>
      <li>The last four or five times I have ordered, it has taken far too long for delivery</li>

    <li> This is a good product was a great buy I liked all the colors and i use it everyday. There are reviews that say this is fake and not urban decay and even if that is true this is still a great product and it works fine and is a very good price. It works great and looks beautiful</li>
    <li> Awesome product ! Does not cake up on eyes , blends beautifully , would like to see one more brush added to this product . Highly recomend !</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my granddaughter. She loved it!!!</li>
    <li> the box was broke - its not what i expected</li>
    <li> If you, like me, like eyeshadows in natural colours this is the perfect palette for you. All the shadows you need in one box. They come on easily and stay all day.</li>
    <li> What?  I ordered the urban decay eyeshadow palette 2. Like 3 weeks later a package from Thailand arrived and it was the palette. I later found out that Odbo is the Thailand version of the Urban decay palettes. If you want the real palette, I suggest buying the real one from urban decay.I rather pay $50 for the urban decay version. Might as well keep it because it&#x27;ll cost more to send it back.</li>
    <li> Nice palette by ODBO, (and that is what it says on top of the case).  Be patient, it takes a while to receive it from Thailand.  If you want a real NAKED palette, go elsewhere.  But I repeat, it&#x27;s a nice palette with good colors.</li>
    <li> I ordered Naked II eye shadow plette.  Weeks later I received a crumpled package from Thailand with a brand of which  I had never heard. Very disappointed and surprised!!</li>
    <li> I really love this! Wished there was a few more colors but it&#x27;s good makeup!</li>
    <li> I saw this on Pintrest. Not all the colors were in the kit, but still has a lot of beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!!! Spend your money on the real deal! They are advertising it as Naked Eyeshadow but it is a complete lie! It is Odbo eyeshadow, some brand which no one has ever heard of. The colors are not the same nor is the quality. Very disappointed that I was mislead!!</li>
    <li> For the price there is little eye shadow</li>
    <li> I see lots of people raving when they buy these counterfeit Urban Decay palettes. They say things like,  \\&quot;It&#x27;s cheaper and looks good, so I don&#x27;t mind!\\&quot;    I also see lots of people calling these counterfeit palettes &#x27;dupes&#x27;. These are not dupes. These are counterfeit. Anything claiming to be another brand is automatically a counterfeit product. Dupes are made by reputable companies that bear their own names, like E.L.F., NYX, and all of these other companies that make their own version of these palettes WITHOUT claiming to be Urban Decay.    If these companies that make these counterfeit Urban Decay products were based in the United States, what they&#x27;re would be doing would be considered illegal. Urban Decay and other reputable brands use ingredients approved by the FDA, and you know what you&#x27;re putting on your face and allowing to be absorbed into your body. These companies putting &#x27;Urban Decay&#x27; on their products are also claiming to use the same ingredients as Urban Decay uses, when you really have no idea what&#x27;s in these products (because they&#x27;re not the same ingredients).    Not to mention, the quality of these products are crap compared to Urban Decay. I&#x27;ve seen and compared a fake Urban Decay palette to the real one. The colors are lackluster, and are nothing more than a bunch of shimmers that don&#x27;t hold a candle to the real deal Urban Decay colors.

    <li> This was mislead- as it was listed as Sephora!</li>
    <li> No, We ordered Urban Decay and got some other brand! I am (as well as my daughter since it was a gift to her) very upset. We can&#x27;t even pronounce the name brand on it. It&#x27;s not the colors she wanted and does not last very long at all. I order from Amazon, a lot. Rethinking that right about now! The last four or five times I have ordered, it has taken far too long for delivery and I have not been satisfied with my products. Guess it&#x27;s back to the mall for us. Sorry, Amazon! Maybe try sending me what I pay for! Because it&#x27;s not worth the hassle to return!  Sincerely,  Former Amazon Shopper (who spent A LOT of money on this site!)</li>
    <li> very nicely packaged, sturdy, just what daughter wanted</li>
    <li> I love this I shadow palette because it has nice pic its a neutral color and everyday makeup.</li>
