### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent smell.  </li>
      <li>He was very happy to get this since he never buys it for himself</li>
      <li>Excellent</li>
      <li>A very good price for a well-known brand.  </li>
      <li>My daughters even think it smells good!</li>
      <li>This smells SO good!</li>
      <li>This smells sooo good!</li>
      <li>It is not overpowering and it has a very sexy manly smell to it!</li>
      <li>A great fragrance.</li>
      <li>This item was great...</li>
      <li>some are not, but this a good product.</li>
      <li>I am more than satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Of all the colognes I&#x27;ve use, I get the most compliments wearing this (from both men and women).  </li>
      <li>sure I would pay this amount again, but glad I found it.</li>
      <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and its a CRACKING FRAGRANCE!!!  :-)</li>
      <li>One of my favorite colognes ever.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance for my husband.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>We love it.  </li>
      <li>If its too good to be true, it isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
      <li>But rather clean, fresh, and sporty in that \\&quot;just-played-tennis-and-showered\\&quot; preppy kind of way.  </li>
      <li>As a daily cologne it is great.</li>
      <li>As with most colognes, it helps to have light hand on the spritzer and don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
      <li>I thought it had a nice masculine scent with an ode to the original.</li>
      <li>A nice variant on the original Polo scent; but not as piney or pungent as the old.  </li>
      <li>I searched at Amazon and found it more reasonably priced.    </li>
      <li>I already own a bottle of this cologne bought from a brick and mortar store, and the item I purchased from Amazon does not smell the same.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a good imitation but just off.  </li>
      <li>Just as the original Polo became a classic, this one will as well.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is very subdued and exciting.  </li>
      <li>I have used Polo for men for a long time and I am very familiar with the smell of it.</li>
      <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even came with A nice little Polo wallet!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the scent</li>
      <li>, I read in Frued that every girl wants to date or marry her</li>
      <li>It came packaged just like the real deal</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this for the man in your life!</li>
      <li>This is NOT the real thing.</li>
      <li>He is really picky with what he wears</li>
      <li>Item is suspect, does not look to be the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>If you like the original scent, you will equally like this one.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>it draws good attention than I&#x27;m game with it.</li>
      <li>Nice, very similar to original Polo but disappointed that it isn&#x27;t more like the scent that was advertised in magazine insert ads which was why I bought it.</li>
      <li>Also, as a few reviewers have previously mentioned the smell fades really fast, again this does not happen with my old/original bottle of cologne that I already own.</li>
      <li>It is a masculine cologne with no hints of sweetness.</li>
      <li>but the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong as I expected and doesn&#x27;t last very long for a high dollar cologne.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand how people are giving it such stellar reviews, maybe there are different bottles/retailers?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In my opinon you just can&#x27;t go wrong with a Polo product, some are better some are not, but this a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 18 and this stuff makes me smell like some girls dad or something. That&#x27;s okay, I read in Frued that every girl wants to date or marry her daddy.&lt;br /&gt;If it draws good attention than I&#x27;m game with it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes ever. Hard to find at times and surely not cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a fragrance strip I smelled in a magazine. I thought it had a nice masculine scent with an ode to the original. I smelled it again at Sephora, but it was about $25 more expensive than I wanted to pay. I searched at Amazon and found it more reasonably priced.    As a daily cologne it is great. It lasts all day and tends to change (mellow) as it wears. It is a masculine cologne with no hints of sweetness. That said it is less intense than regular Polo, which borders on an industrial, sometimes toxic smell if used in the wrong quantities. This one can be worn to business meetings, dinner, or daily without overpowering others in the process.    As with most colognes, it helps to have light hand on the spritzer and don&#x27;t use too much.  A little goes a long way with Polo Modern Reserve.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I will buy. No more to it.</li>
    <li> This product is everything you would expect from a Ralph Lauren fragrance. Just as the original Polo became a classic, this one will as well. If you like the original scent, you will equally like this one. Very long lasting fragrance. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell.  It lasts a very long time.  We love it.  A very good price for a well-known brand.  I am more than satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get my husband some cologne for Christmas. He is really picky with what he wears (actually he NEVER wore cologne before dating me). This smells SO good! It is not overpowering and it has a very sexy manly smell to it! My daughters even think it smells good! I would highly recommend this for the man in your life!</li>
    <li> Item is suspect, does not look to be the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;. I already own a bottle of this cologne bought from a brick and mortar store, and the item I purchased from Amazon does not smell the same. Also, as a few reviewers have previously mentioned the smell fades really fast, again this does not happen with my old/original bottle of cologne that I already own. My advice would be to stay away from this product. I don&#x27;t understand how people are giving it such stellar reviews, maybe there are different bottles/retailers?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order this.  If its too good to be true, it isn&#x27;t true.  This package was the wrong color and altho the packaging was very good, the bottle inside was filthy with fingerprints and smudges all over.  The bottle is a good imitation but just off.  It smells amost the same but doesn&#x27;t last.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is getting harder and harder to find. It was pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I would pay this amount again, but glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I have used Polo for men for a long time and I am very familiar with the smell of it. This is NOT the real thing. It came packaged just like the real deal but this is a knock off. I have decided to never order perfume from Amazon again and if they do not post this, Il nevcer order anything else again.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance for my husband.  Fragrance is very subdued and exciting.  Fragrance completes his presence.  A great fragrance.</li>
    <li> Arrived in less than 4 days and was just what I wanted.  A nice variant on the original Polo scent; but not as piney or pungent as the old.  But rather clean, fresh, and sporty in that \\&quot;just-played-tennis-and-showered\\&quot; preppy kind of way.  One spritz down the front of the shirt will last all day.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent but the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong as I expected and doesn&#x27;t last very long for a high dollar cologne.</li>
    <li> Nice, very similar to original Polo but disappointed that it isn&#x27;t more like the scent that was advertised in magazine insert ads which was why I bought it.</li>
    <li> This item was great...</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas for hubby. He loves it. This smells sooo good! He was very happy to get this since he never buys it for himself bec it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto y y excelente servicio. Muy rápida la entrega, en tiempo récord. Lo recomiendo. El producto llego en excelente condiciones.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even came with A nice little Polo wallet!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely boxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and its a CRACKING FRAGRANCE!!!  :-)</li>
    <li> Of all the colognes I&#x27;ve use, I get the most compliments wearing this (from both men and women).  It is a limited edition, so I would grab it now.</li>
