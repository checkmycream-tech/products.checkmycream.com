      <li>Anyways I&#x27;ll use it some more &amp; leave an updated review.</li>
      <li>I love how feature packed it is and</li>
      <li>:) :)</li>
      <li>This waver works better than anyone we have tried.</li>
      <li>See, most people who are growing their hair out like me, wash it, don&#x27;t touch it, and can sleep on it (if they work out in the evening).</li>
      <li>This makes me look like I have a lot more hair than I do.</li>
      <li>Love how my hair looks.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t just run it through your hair like a straightener and it magically be wavy.</li>
      <li>If your are someone like me who loves to wear different types of curles or styles then this is a very great product!</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more of a wave effect.  </li>
      <li>I have waves for most the day.</li>
      <li>It creates really lovely waves and gives a lot of body.</li>
      <li>(not shower head and not nasty sweaty hair either).  </li>
      <li>By no means does this review reflect on the product, but mostly on the seller for sending a branded product in a plastic bag.</li>
      <li>and it looked normal LOL. :)</li>
      <li>After using the product, I have beautiful, natural looking waves.</li>
      <li>Cool with me!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as easy as 1 2 3.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use and adds lots of volume to your hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and works every time.</li>
      <li>this is and easy way to do curls.</li>
      <li>But it hasn&#x27;t really made my hair look amazing - yet.  </li>
      <li>Because I work later, I get to work out in the AM, which is great except I&#x27;m rushing from the shower to work, and I want to look presentable</li>
      <li>have u ever REALLY watched as they curled or used some kind of appliance on your hair??</li>
      <li>but it does not heat up near as good</li>
      <li>but my dry curls always were BEAUTIFUL.</li>
      <li>Love it ..compared prices at other stores by far the cheapest Awesome!!!</li>
      <li>This product does more or a large crimping effect.</li>
      <li>Just nice soft waves.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>This is one cool hair appliance.</li>
      <li>Works way better than my old Revlon one I got from a pharmacy years ago and assumed was fine.  </li>
      <li>I was stunned how evenly and quickly it crimps the hair,</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good for my long hair</li>
      <li>I ordered this, really pretty!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy my boyfriend even was able to help me with the back of my head</li>
      <li>Worth</li>
      <li>But so far I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So if you have lots of hair it does it all pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>To be honest I have extremely long hair and no patience, this was exactly what I needed to achieve the wavy look I&#x27;ve always wanted without all the work.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use it for the &amp;#34;wet to dry&amp;#34; feature because I don&#x27;t want to burn my hair, the iron get&#x27;s very hot but is adjustable.</li>
      <li>The wave pattern is perfect, not too big, not too small, not too crimp-like.</li>
      <li>creates the exact waves I was hoping for, so much better and different than just wrapping hair around a cone curling iron.</li>
      <li>When my hair gets longer, I&#x27;ll purchase a different one that has a deeper dip, but I love this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it has some negatives, but the final result on styling more than makes up for them.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the customer service from Remington is absolutely stellar.  </li>
      <li>I set it to about 7 (out of 15, I think) and it was too hot.</li>
      <li>: Unit does get extremely hot so use care when heated</li>
      <li>Better than regular metal.  </li>
      <li>It gives it a styled look like you actually did something:)</li>
      <li>Made my hair so pretty</li>
      <li>This morning I tried out the Remington waver and instantly fell in love.</li>
      <li>I have gotten  tons of positive comments when I wave my hair and people</li>
      <li>I pretty much straightens my hair.</li>
      <li>I appreciate the dial non-digital heat control, but with my fine hair I only have to go about 1/3 of the way up the dial</li>
      <li>she also really like how it looked.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This waver is so much what I was looking for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Happy with my purchase, gives Lana Del Rey hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with frizzy hair... Even now when my hair is/has been at its driest, I still don&#x27;t normally have this problem. However, I noticed that whenever I would try to use this, my hair would become a huge frizzy mess and the waves don&#x27;t hold. MAYBE if I pour a whole bunch of products on my hair, this might come through... But I don&#x27;t like putting excessive products in my hair (I have asian, thin, flat hair so more products &#x3D; more flatness)</li>
    <li> Did not care for the results, returned product.</li>
    <li> Love it ..compared prices at other stores by far the cheapest Awesome!!! I have tried it on wet hair and dry hair works Awesome!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me the waves I thought it would. Dries my hair pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t give it a wave when wet to dry. I pretty much straightens my hair. When used on dry hair I pretty much have to crimp my hair to get it to wave. You can&#x27;t just run it through your hair like a straightener and it magically be wavy. I have really thick hair so it took a long time and I basically got tired and quit halfway through because of the time. It also doesn&#x27;t save me any time on drying my hair, pretty much the same amount of time as blow drying plus using a straightener to finish after drying, now I&#x27;m only using one device instead of 2. I gave 2 stars because it does dry it, despite the length it takes, but definitely not worth it for the waves. To be quicker on the drying time I&#x27;ll probably have to wait at least an hour after I shower for most of the hair to air dry first then maybe it won&#x27;t take as long.</li>
    <li> This gives my hair the &#x27;body&#x27; that is missing from my fine hair.  I will buy another when this one dies.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product.  I was hoping for more of a wave effect.  This product does more or a large crimping effect.</li>
    <li> burns your hair. don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her fluffy hair!!! She has used this several times already and so far it works well!</li>
    <li> I bought the wet 2 wave for my birthday, because I thought it would be really smart to dry my hair while waving it. Waving it and drying your hair doesn&#x27;t work too well, but if your hair if fairly dry I think it works fine. I can ever help but feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair a lot with this product, even with heat protectant spray. This is also my back up straightener. It straightens your hair too. Just use it like a straightener, but don&#x27;t pause when going down the section of hair. Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I was iffy about this, I have flat long very straight  thick hair and I never get it to curl and stay longer than hour. But this thing did great I have waves for most the day. Also it&#x27;s big so it does a good amount of hair so it&#x27;s good for my long hair cause it takes forever to do with normal wavers or curlers. So if you have lots of hair it does it all pretty quickly. I can do all my long (middle of my back)hair in about 10-20 mins depending on if I take my time or hurry. But it&#x27;s great all in all!</li>
    <li> This waver works better than anyone we have tried. It&#x27;s easy to use and works every time. It&#x27;s a must buy.</li>
    <li> Hi just purchased and it&#x27;s either doesn&#x27;t work or I don&#x27;t know how to use it. Any ideas?</li>
    <li> This crimper works *really* well.  I was stunned how evenly and quickly it crimps the hair, whether you take a large or small section.  It sets the hair well, even without using any hair product.  Works way better than my old Revlon one I got from a pharmacy years ago and assumed was fine.  I got rid of that one immediately.  (Note that this is an S-waver/crimper, not an iron for creating very loose flowing waves.)  There are just two things I would like to change about this one, though... it is very heavy.  1.3 lb is a lot to hold up over your head with one arm.  It&#x27;s by far the heaviest iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  Too heavy to travel with.  The clamping mechanism is quite stiff, so after a while I have to use two hands to close the jaws.  And secondly, it&#x27;s actually too powerful.  I appreciate the dial non-digital heat control, but with my fine hair I only have to go about 1/3 of the way up the dial and that is enough.  The extra power draw is making the lights flash in my bathroom.  And that circuit is not overloaded.  It&#x27;s inconvenient to take the supplies into another room and use another outlet.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be this powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it on wet hair, as it claims you can (that&#x27;s what the vent holes on one side are for).&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic plates are nice.  Better than regular metal.  Less damaging to the hair, and more even heating.  And the plates fit snugly together, without uneven gaps, like in my other one.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it has some negatives, but the final result on styling more than makes up for them.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the customer service from Remington is absolutely stellar.  Very impressed.  I would not hesitate to order again from them in the future.</li>
    <li> Is does what it says , it just wasn&#x27;t what I wanted looking for straightener this is not one . Unclear ad</li>
    <li> But it hasn&#x27;t really made my hair look amazing - yet.  I like the &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; idea of this.  See, most people who are growing their hair out like me, wash it, don&#x27;t touch it, and can sleep on it (if they work out in the evening). Because I work later, I get to work out in the AM, which is great except I&#x27;m rushing from the shower to work, and I want to look presentable (not shower head and not nasty sweaty hair either).  On my off days where I don&#x27;t wash I use dry shampoo/ponytail or bun.&lt;br /&gt;Today I didn&#x27;t have any time but I like this the couple times I have used it! It gives it a styled look like you actually did something:)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this waver! I had been searching for a waver that was covered like a straightener or crimper and I was thrilled to find this. I have gotten  tons of positive comments when I wave my hair and people always ask me what I used.</li>
    <li> Makes hair look weird and crimped like the 80s. Also fried and damaged my hair. No good. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give me the required look I was going for. I think I wanted a smaller wave pattern. Delivery was fast</li>
    <li> Love love love it! Made my hair so pretty &amp; I even kept it in for 2 days to do a messier look the 2nd day &amp; the curls still looked great! MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair look gorgeous and I use L&#x27;Oréal Mega Spritz on my hair along with the Wet2Waves and the waves last ALL day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this review 3 stars simply because I received this product, and unfortunately never got to use it. I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this iron, and wanted to try it, but I was so disappointed when I received mine, because it was wrapped in plastic bag , with no packaging. I mean why would you send a product like that to a customer?? By no means does this review reflect on the product, but mostly on the seller for sending a branded product in a plastic bag. Very disappointed, so I obviously returned it.</li>
    <li> Its The Best I Felt in Love With This Product...&lt;br /&gt;Its Worth To Buy This Product.. im Obssed With This🙌🙌</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She and her friends love this and their hair all looks great!!</li>
    <li> This iron is great! I don&#x27;t really use it for the &amp;#34;wet to dry&amp;#34; feature because I don&#x27;t want to burn my hair, the iron get&#x27;s very hot but is adjustable.</li>
    <li> If your are someone like me who loves to wear different types of curles or styles then this is a very great product! I never used it wet but my dry curls always were BEAUTIFUL. i recommend this product! If you do hair (which i do) this is and easy way to do curls. Its up there with the wind... I will be purchansing another one... it takes me 15-30 to do my brazilian hair thats 20-24 inches long!</li>
    <li> heats up really fast . waves perfectly . i think it will work on any hair type. great to add body to your hair .</li>
    <li> works great nice change for the hair</li>
    <li> It does work. I have very thick hair and I let it air dry for about 10 mins after towel drying it and it dried it as it crimped it. To me, these are not waves, this crimps the hair. It took about 15 mins from start to finish.</li>
    <li> after a while the iron turns itself off and the expected results are not obtained.after a while the iron turns itself off and the expected results are not obtained.</li>
    <li> I have a Remington Pink Pearl Straightner, and I just adore that thing. So when I was at Wal-Mart yesterday, I saw the Wet 2 Wave tool and decided you can&#x27;t go wrong. I have a Revlon one but it does not heat up near as good and you have to hold it on your hair for a LONG time in order for it to work right. Pleh! This morning I tried out the Remington waver and instantly fell in love. No kidding. I did use on my wet hair and it came out dry. I don&#x27;t know that it \\&quot;cuts\\&quot; the getting ready process time down but it does work extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest getting one of those styling gloves as the tool does emit steam when using on wet hair. I do highly recommend this styling tool if you are thinking about it. I am a very satisfied customer.:) :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it ! It arrived earlier than expexted in its original Remington package. It works really well.. i used it for 10seconds on high heat.. but thats my hair! If you have thin hair don go high on the heat. It is time consuming though, you need alot of patience..</li>
    <li> I love this! I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet hair, but i have done my hair a few times dry and I get lots of compliments! It is so easy to use and adds lots of volume to your hair. With some hair spray, the wave even last until the next day for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works just how I expected. I don&#x27;t burn myself with this and it makes lasting waves</li>
    <li> gracias muy buen producto</li>
    <li> I like to curl my hair.  This took an extra step out of the routine.  Now I just curl as I dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times &amp; I kept it at the lower end of both the wet &amp; dry settings. Some people say they&#x27;ve fried their hair with it?? But those of you that have gone to a stylest??.....have u ever REALLY watched as they curled or used some kind of appliance on your hair?? They don&#x27;t clamp down and leave it in place for ever. In fact they usually keep the iron (whichever kind they r using) moving. It&#x27;s a constant motion even with the curling iron. Like my stylest uses one with out a plastic holder on the end &amp; a glove to protect her hand from the heat. Anyways I&#x27;ll use it some more &amp; leave an updated review. But so far I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend who&#x27;s mom is a stylest was over &amp; watched me use it &amp; next visit she&#x27;s gonna use it on her hair (she has a mane of beautiful thick long dark hair!) she also really like how it looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I used it from damp then went out in the rain shopping? Still wavy today AND people I didn&#x27;t even know said I like your hair! Cool with me! My husband hates what he has deemed as 80&#x27;s hair?? This does NOT give that look. Just nice soft waves. (Oh also I used some joico gel &amp; morraccain oil while I brushed out my wet hair-so before I used the iron)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I WILL have you note that if you do not hold it with the steam vents out? It seems to leave a lite extra &amp;#34;crimp line&amp;#34; not highly noticeable but since we were really checking it out, we noticed the line &amp; turned to the back over to finish &amp; it was gone!</li>
    <li> Great Product! creates the exact waves I was hoping for, so much better and different than just wrapping hair around a cone curling iron. Heats up super fast (in 30 seconds) unlike my Revlon which takes at least ten minutes to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Impressed- I have always had great luck with Remington products, I don&#x27;t plan on switching especially with this great of a price.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and fine and I have always found it very difficult to get body in it. This product is AMAZING! It has given my normally limp, lifeless hair so much body. After using the product, I have beautiful, natural looking waves. The wave pattern is perfect, not too big, not too small, not too crimp-like. It creates really lovely waves and gives a lot of body. I would recommend this product to anyone with any type of hair. If you&#x27;ve always desired nice waves and great body, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> This waver is so much what I was looking for. The price is reasonable &amp; it heats up fast . The wave pattern is perfect. Im happy I ordered this, really pretty!</li>
    <li> Read the instructions and pay attention to heat settings.  The settings depend on whether your hair is wet OR dry. Watching tutorials on YouTube was very helpful. I was really worried it might fry my hair, but it hasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used it a few times. Someone asked me if I had braided my hair the night before, another person thought my hair had the natural wave to it.  It doesn&#x27;t take that long to do, and if you do it correctly, it lasts for a few days--saving you time getting ready in the morning :-)</li>
    <li> It doesnt work as i want</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, but it does damage my hair quite a lot!</li>
    <li> Be careful with the heat settings, though, because they are not listed by temperature (like 350 degrees, etc.). I set it to about 7 (out of 15, I think) and it was too hot. Start low and work your way up.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this, you can use this waver on damp hair, but I haven&#x27;t yet. I did on my hair when it was dry and it only took maybe 5 mins and I have pretty thick hair, just past my shoulders and I loved the results. Kind of crimpy waves. When my hair gets longer, I&#x27;ll purchase a different one that has a deeper dip, but I love this. Great price. Definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a mother of a 2 1/2 year old boy, so I don&#x27;t always get a lot of time to fix myself up, this is much much easier than curling, plus it&#x27;s different. Nice to switch it up :)</li>
    <li> This product is honestly the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for my hair. I have very damaged bleach blonde hair, and it&#x27;s hard for me to find products that work nicely and avoid my hair getting frizzy. This is definitely it. I was eager to try this because I used to own the Remington Wet 2 Straight, after 3 years it finally died on me and when I saw this waver I had to try it. To be honest I have extremely long hair and no patience, this was exactly what I needed to achieve the wavy look I&#x27;ve always wanted without all the work. I highly recommend it, I&#x27;m in love. :) I don&#x27;t even have to put any heat treatments in my hair to keep it looking nice. I have yet to try to wave it from when it was wet, and I probably won&#x27;t, anything that takes moisture out of your hair is obviously not going to be a good thing, so I&#x27;d avoid the high settings.. Even when I had the wet 2 straight, I would use it to run through my hair until damp, (not even on highest heat settings,) let my hair air dry a little more, and then start straightening it. I&#x27;ll be honest if you straightened your hair while wet, it wouldn&#x27;t stay straight throughout the day. So I&#x27;m not even attempting with this waver, but regardless it&#x27;s a great product, it took me only about 10 minutes to style my whole head with waves! It&#x27;s so easy my boyfriend even was able to help me with the back of my head and it looked normal LOL. :)</li>
    <li> returned this item....unless you have hours to spend drying your hair, don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> This is one cool hair appliance. It does exactly what it promises to do - give you a head full of beachy curls and waves while drying your hair at the same time. It heats up very quickly, is easy to use, and takes my wet, straight hair from blah to amazing in way less time than it would take me to blow dry and then curl. It has temperature control and automatic shutoff. I love how feature packed it is and the its great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very careful with my hair (it&#x27;s almost waist length and very fine, thin, and straight). This makes me look like I have a lot more hair than I do. Even with using this product I don&#x27;t have one split end or any problem with frizz or dryness. That comes from using hair oils (like Vatika) as deep conditioners, using the right shampoo, and using a heat protectant all over my hair. It&#x27;s as easy as 1 2 3. I wouldn&#x27;t even sell this back; it&#x27;s MINE and I&#x27;m going to cherish it for the stellar little appliance that it is. I really can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough! *Note: Unit does get extremely hot so use care when heated but there is really no need for protectant glove. :) I think this one is a steal and couldn&#x27;t be made any better!</li>
    <li> Love how my hair looks. Bringing back the 80s</li>
    <li> when your trying to curl your wet hair this thing only dries your hair and not curling your hair,and it leaves your hair frizzy and dry</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Did not work on my hair when wet and made my hair frizzy, even when I used it when my hair was try. Better off blow drying your hair and using the Bed Head Waver!</li>
    <li> Not the best, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Burns up... The surface did not fit properly. Returned</li>
