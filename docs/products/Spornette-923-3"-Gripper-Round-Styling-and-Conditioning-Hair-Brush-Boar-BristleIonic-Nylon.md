    <li> Wonderful brush for blow drying my hair. Cuts down on dry time considerably.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected.  I didn&#x27;t want to waste money returning it, but it&#x27;s not what I had expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I love this brush! Whenever I would blowdry my hair before with a different brush, my hair would just become a giant frizzy ball. I had tried all kinds of products and even different brushes, but nothing would work. I just got so frustrated that I just quit blowdrying my hair. I just let it air dry which made it a limp mess. I got this after watching a youtube video. I tried it out this morning, and the results are amazing! My hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy at all, had volume, and was very soft. This is my absolute favorite brush of all time. I&#x27;ll be buying a second one to have as a backup because I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairbrush for blow drying your hair. It grabs all your hair. It is amazing!!</li>
    <li> My favorite brush! I use it to detangle and straighten when I blow dry. I have very long hair and this brush perfectly does the trick. I used to use drug store brand brushes- I&#x27;ll never go back. A few dollars more and worth every penny. (But not nearly As expensive as some brushes can be!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers mentioned static- this is true for the first few uses. By the third or forth time, I find that to no longer be an issue.</li>
    <li> I thought the only person who could make my hair look great was my hairstylist.  It always comes out silky smooth with no frizzy ends when she does it.  I asked her what her secret was and she said it was the brush she used.  Rounded, but most importantly, boars hair.  As soon as I started doing my hair with this brush, it came out smooth as silk.  I LOVE this brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my long fine blonde hair.</li>
    <li> love the bristles on tis brush.</li>
    <li> The best brush I ever owened. Makes my hair very shiny. Very easy to use, has a great hold. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!! Really tugs at every strand!! Makes my hair super shiny with lots of volume!! Cuts down on drying time as well</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how quickly I was able to dry and straighten my hair.  The handle is comfortable, the brush is not too heavy and the bristles are strong and grip, but don&#x27;t catch or pull.  Leaves my hair smooth and scalp tingling.  Wish I&#x27;d thrown out my old brush long ago.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  Works well for blowing out my wavy hair - I can make it look just like I came from the salon.  I&#x27;ve used many, many brushes over the years, and this is my favorite bar far.  It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> nice size, for my mid lenght frizzy hair, at first it felt too hard, after a couple of uses, it became easier to use, i like it.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I have tried every brush out there and I still struggled with my past the shoulder, wavy hair. I use the Rusk W8Less 2000 watt hairdryer. Even with that it used to take me at least 45 minutes to blow out my hair. Now it only takes 15 minutes because I&#x27;m not fighting with the brush. The first time I struggled a bit because it holds the hair so tight, but now it is so easy to use. Others have mentioned it gets too hot to touch. There is even a warning on the brush label regarding it getting hot. My brush never gets so hot it burns my skin or my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is not that great it gets way too hot that you cant even hold the brush good just not a good buy</li>
    <li> Perfect size even though shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I saw this brush used on a you tube video and decided to try it. It does work much better than a regular brush because it grips your hair from the roots to the ends and holds it in place while you are blow drying your hair. Love this brush. The only con would be that it is slightly heavier than a regular brush, but if you have no physical issues with your hands it won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great brush but not for my hair. I&#x27;m use to the ceramic brushes. It pulled my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  It&#x27;s perfect to blow dry and straighten my very thick, naturally curly hair.  The blend of bristle types is perfect if you have coarse, thick, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail and so pleased with this brush. Love the black/pink combo, the soft handle and 3&amp;#34; is the perfect size to blowdry my long hair. The nylon/boar bristles are supposed to be good for the hair. Very happy with this. Glad I opted for this brush vs a $30 one. Shipped fast too!</li>
    <li> Love this brush have never had one like it, leaves my hair smooth w no frizzy. I don&#x27;t have curly hair but it&#x27;s not straight either but it is really freezy if I don&#x27;t do anything to it so blow drying w this brush is great.</li>
    <li> I have thick fine curly hair but this brush was very rough, be careful it can hurt.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, going to buy another one</li>
