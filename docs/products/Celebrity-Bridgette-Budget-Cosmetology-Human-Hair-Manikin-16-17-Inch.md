      <li>This item came quickly and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>She is able to use it.</li>
      <li>I love this mannequin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like the size of an adolescent child&#x27;s head.    </li>
      <li>but this head should have been better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied because I can still use it,I just need another for length now.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with quality and price.  </li>
      <li>so its ok</li>
      <li>I am glad I had ordered two</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 16 inches long like the description states, but it was the perfect length for me.</li>
      <li>The hair was good, but it did shed a lot when I first started to braid it.   </li>
      <li>The skin tone is great and the cut of the hair works out good for me to see where shadows are cast on the face due to hair styling.  </li>
      <li>Over all it was a good purchase with fast delivery and inexpensive price...  </li>
      <li>you still have to cut moor if you want the cut to look good styled, I did a very sparse cut</li>
      <li>, I wanted it to be easy to cut and to me</li>
      <li>I bought the manikin because I wanted to learn how to braid fine hair.   </li>
      <li>She was just fine for that for me.</li>
      <li>It was  fine for her.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it&#x27;s fit on the manikin stand.</li>
      <li>and it was so cheap</li>
      <li>I will enjoy working with styles and dying.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The price/ROI ratio is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>The hair count isn&#x27;t good enough so Its not at all easy to work with, if you purchasing these for school try to see if you school has better as these just didn&#x27;t cut right in the end.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product as a cost effective means of testing lighting schemes and photographt techniques for portraiture.  </li>
      <li>It is wonderful to check/practice lighting setups, where repetitive shots are required.</li>
      <li>We originally bought this to practice doing braids &amp; hair buns for dance.&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
      <li>Too many layers to really be exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>The doll has much shorter hair then the picture shows, but most importantly the doll has LAYERS.</li>
      <li>and im ready to start doing her hair :).</li>
      <li>spend 20 or more and get something better that will last longer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great either for someone who wants to learn for personal interest or if they&#x27;re practicing for a career.  </li>
      <li>very pretty.</li>
      <li>great for learning, the hair was a little shorter than I wanted though.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic for anyone who wants to learn how to do hair.  </li>
      <li>nice human hair</li>
      <li>A lot of fun for our daughter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Brad on right)</li>
      <li>The mannequin was delivered very quickly, however the hair was much shorter than described and also already came already cut and very layered.</li>
      <li>I got it with amazon prime and it came super fast.</li>
      <li>Looking a many videos and reading a number of E books before I tried this I bought this manikin to experiment with different lighting setups.</li>
      <li>At about $30.00 I will probably purchase some more with different skin tones and hair color.</li>
      <li>She worked very well for me!</li>
      <li>they are not what they say top of head only 5-6 inch hair</li>
      <li>For a while I&#x27;ve been doing table top photography but recently decided to try some portraiture.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m Satisfied.</li>
      <li>We found maybe 10-15 grey hairs which kinda made me feel good that she really does have human hair</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t matter how much you wash it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so real that I have to store it in a bag off of the tripod because it scares the s</li>
      <li>Her hair is stick straight.  </li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>It did work, but the hair was a bit shorter than I really wanted it.  </li>
      <li>Shipping Was Fast.</li>
      <li>, the hair sheds a lot, everytime u comb or maybe pull ur hands through, maybe not be much all the time</li>
      <li>but the hair was much shorter</li>
      <li>It worked very well for me.   </li>
      <li>Not as much hair as in the picture though,</li>
      <li>i was so ready to get this head</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast for this replacement.</li>
      <li>Not as much split ends as the 1st Bridgette mannikin I had</li>
      <li>It works well for lighting practice and I&#x27;m confident it will last darn near a lifetime.</li>
      <li>but this is a manikin, it doesn&#x27;t grow back, shouldn&#x27;t be shedding so much!!!</li>
      <li>The hair was easy to work with not too thick, perfect for cutting quickly.</li>
      <li>and I needed to get back to retake it rather quickly.</li>
      <li>I know I should be able to look at her and tell that her hair is short, but it&#x27;s really short.  </li>
      <li>This hair feels real so practice is more realistic than with less professional models.  </li>
      <li>If you can live with shorter hair, go for it.</li>
      <li>The hair wasn&#x27;t the same length throughout the whole head.</li>
      <li>Works very well to practice different hair styles.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Easter.</li>
      <li>my 6 year old daughter...    </li>
      <li>I bought this item for my 8 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>:  Decent enough quality for the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I cant say I have any experience working with long straight hair, (being a guy with 1\\&quot; curly hair).</li>
      <li>Good quality implants, a natural hair pattern with more hair pulled through individually/small amounts rather than a huge chunk causing the base to be very stiff as I have seen on a lot of my other doll heads.</li>
      <li>The Manikin head&#x27;s \\&quot;hole\\&quot; seems to be undersized to fit on the little head stand I ordered at the same time.</li>
      <li>it is barely below jaw length.</li>
      <li>One last comment, it;s just slightly smaller than an adult woman&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the same as putting the brand name of a mirror directly in the middle of the mirror.</li>
      <li>I Was A Little Nervous About It Really Being Human Hair, But It&#x27;s Really Human Hair</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t give any advice on using the hair for thermal projects as I only used it for cutting, but the hair seemed high quality and as good if not better than the ones that come in the cosmetology kit you will get at school.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this for my portrait photo class assignments and for setting up my lights before a shoot. It&#x27;s so real that I have to store it in a bag off of the tripod because it scares the s*** out of my wife and I when we walk into the studio room. I did have to yank one star due to her name being branded in ink across her throat. What&#x27;s the damn point? Yes, I know the point is branding and marketing but it&#x27;s the same as putting the brand name of a mirror directly in the middle of the mirror. I WILL find a way to remove the name and when I do, I&#x27;ll share how I did it. One last comment, it;s just slightly smaller than an adult woman&#x27;s head. It&#x27;s more like the size of an adolescent child&#x27;s head.    Nutshell- I have nothing to compare it to but I feel I got a solid deal. It works well for lighting practice and I&#x27;m confident it will last darn near a lifetime.</li>
    <li> The manikin itself is nice, but i can&#x27;t find a stand that fits it.  I&#x27;ve been to sally&#x27;s and cosmoprof and the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; stands they have do not fit.  Have no idea where i can find one</li>
    <li> The mannequin was delivered very quickly, however the hair was much shorter than described and also already came already cut and very layered. I bought this mannequin to cut but because of the layers I can not even use it for this purpose, I was very disappointed,</li>
    <li> The human hair manikin has human like hair. It is good for experience. I will enjoy working with styles and dying.</li>
    <li> I was in a tight pinch when I ordered my mannequin head from this seller. I had failed my cosmetology practical part of my test and I needed to get back to retake it rather quickly. I was devastated from failing to begin with as I had made a 91 on it in Mock and I could not wait for State Supply to order me one.   I had ordered extra mannequins on Ebay before to use in school and needless to say you never know about shipping when you order from Ebay and I have learned to always be prepared to maybe not get an item at all when ordering there, so I could not risk getting delayed by going there. I have bought quite a bit from Amazon and it&#x27;s always been a good experience so I came here and found this seller along with several others.   I chose this mannequin because I didn&#x27;t want the hair to be too long, I wanted it to be easy to cut and to me the shorter was easier after previously cutting the longer haired manikin in the first test. The hair was easy to work with not too thick, perfect for cutting quickly. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it&#x27;s fit on the manikin stand. It worked very well for me.   I can&#x27;t give any advice on using the hair for thermal projects as I only used it for cutting, but the hair seemed high quality and as good if not better than the ones that come in the cosmetology kit you will get at school.  I passed my test the second time around! I know my downfall the first time was only my nerves, so the second time I just relaxed and having this mannequin made the hair cutting section of the test easier for me. Due to thickness, length and texture, It was easier to section off, easier to part, easier to handle and easier to cut because of length. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 16 inches long like the description states, but it was the perfect length for me. I also received the mannequin in just a few days.  Good luck on your state board!</li>
    <li> i was so ready to get this head and it was so cheap i mean i got it fast but the hair was much shorter then i exspected....and yes it is already layered off uh not a good thing when ur into the hair field.....so its ok but this head should have been better</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to learn how to cornrow (scalp braid) perfect product for learning how to do the foundation of sew ins. The hair sheds a strand or two here and there but that&#x27;s to be expected with regular use.</li>
    <li> This item came quickly and in good condition.  Good price.  I know I should be able to look at her and tell that her hair is short, but it&#x27;s really short.  If you need to practice cuts, or most up do&#x27;s, it makes it a little difficult.  Other than that, she is a good doll though. &#x3D;)[[ASIN:B002ZNJI3K Celebrity Bridgette Budget Cosmetology Human Hair Manikin, 16-17 Inch]]</li>
    <li> The manikin was what I expected.  I can practice on it and do what is needed.  I received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> The name says it all (budget).  I bought the manikin because I wanted to learn how to braid fine hair.   The hair was good, but it did shed a lot when I first started to braid it.   Also the length is suppose to be 16-17\\&quot; that was not true.   Over all it was a good purchase with fast delivery and inexpensive price...  If you have any questions comment on the review and I will comment back...</li>
    <li> Not as much split ends as the 1st Bridgette mannikin I had and im ready to start doing her hair :). The shipping was fast for this replacement.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for a friend. They say they like the product. With that I am thinking that it was a great purchase...it arrived in a timely manner and was instrumental in helping them finish school.</li>
    <li> This review is from the perspective of a photographer using this item as a photography target to test lighting techniques, aperture settings, shutter settings, and matrix metering modes as well as focusing techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price/ROI ratio is fantastic.  After conducting a great deal of research, I could not find any mannequin heads specifically designed for photography.  After reading some reviews, I settled on this head.  The skin tone is great and the cut of the hair works out good for me to see where shadows are cast on the face due to hair styling.  One issue is the catchlights pre-painted on the eyes.  For that, I simply used a permanent black marker to color over the catchlights.  I may ultimately end up using a clear laquer to increase reflection on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another possible modification I may make is placing a small focusing target on one of her cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product as a cost effective means of testing lighting schemes and photographt techniques for portraiture.  At about $30.00 I will probably purchase some more with different skin tones and hair color.</li>
    <li> She worked very well for me!</li>
    <li> I purchased this so I could showcase the hair clips that I sell.  It did work, but the hair was a bit shorter than I really wanted it.  Too many layers to really be exactly what I wanted.  If you need long hair, do not get this one.  If you can live with shorter hair, go for it.</li>
    <li> Mannequin was ordered for use in State Board testing.  Met requirements and was cheaper than from Beauty Supply store or if purchased through school.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a disposable manikin very thin hairline on top. you pay for what you get. spend 20 or more and get something better that will last longer. When you brush the hair it comes out. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Good quality implants, a natural hair pattern with more hair pulled through individually/small amounts rather than a huge chunk causing the base to be very stiff as I have seen on a lot of my other doll heads. Down side, there is already weird layers but it&#x27;s not cut, it s implanted that way... you still have to cut moor if you want the cut to look good styled, I did a very sparse cut abd it is barely below jaw length. I&#x27;m satisfied because I can still use it,I just need another for length now.</li>
    <li> Needed the mannequin for my state board test. The hair wasn&#x27;t the same length throughout the whole head. Thank God they didn&#x27;t check it but she still got the job done.</li>
    <li> Smaller, thinning hair, shorter then expected hair length. Guess you get what you pay for. The word Budget is a clue folks. Stick to Marianna brand.(Mr. Brad on right)</li>
    <li> Good product and price appropriate</li>
    <li> a good mani to color perm or hilite as in all mani just don&#x27;t over wash them. nice human hair</li>
    <li> I bought this doll for my state board test. The doll has much shorter hair then the picture shows, but most importantly the doll has LAYERS. Short layers, that in no way, can be cut to a blunt hair cut, unless she has 3inch hair, which definitely is not allowed for state board. DO NOT BUY THIS DOLL FOR STATE BOARD EXAMS!</li>
    <li> The hair don&#x27;t color, eeerrrr!!!, the hair sheds a lot, everytime u comb or maybe pull ur hands through, maybe not be much all the time but this is a manikin, it doesn&#x27;t grow back, shouldn&#x27;t be shedding so much!!!</li>
    <li> Well I have never bought anything like this before so I looked over a lot of the reviews. I got it with amazon prime and it came super fast. I think it was here the day after I ordered it. She was just like the picture except in life she looked a bit younger. We found maybe 10-15 grey hairs which kinda made me feel good that she really does have human hair but, my friend hasn&#x27;t tried using her yet. Hair is layered but it goes a little past where her shoulders would be. Overall for the price and the feel of the hair and quality I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a photography target. The hair feels/looks good. I cant say I have any experience working with long straight hair, (being a guy with 1\\&quot; curly hair). It seems to brush easily enough. The Manikin head&#x27;s \\&quot;hole\\&quot; seems to be undersized to fit on the little head stand I ordered at the same time. I dont know if this is common or not.     As a photography target, there are only a couple of complaints. The eyes look a little, well, eerie. I think I will have my sister in law, who is a cosmotologist, put some better eyebrows, and maybe fake lashes. It is also kind of a weird color, a little too yellow. Perhaps some makeup is required. It is so much easier to have a fixed subject that doesnt complain \\&quot;Dad, Im tired of pictures\\&quot;. It is wonderful to check/practice lighting setups, where repetitive shots are required. The head seems a litle small to be representative of a real head. Check the customer image of it and my 6 year old daughter...    I dont know about the 16-17inch part of it, but the longest hairs I can measure are about 12\\&quot;.    RAD</li>
    <li> My daughter liked it.  It&#x27;s hair on a head.  She is able to use it.</li>
    <li> Her hair is stick straight.  I used her for my state board exam.  I cut her hair for the practical portion using her for the perm, chemical and thermal portion.  She was just fine for that for me.</li>
    <li> Hair was matted and didn&#x27;t look like what was online. I am glad I had ordered two so I wasn&#x27;t without one for class</li>
    <li> I am pleased with quality and price.  Did not have any faults discussed  in other reviews.  Recommended for cosmetology students.</li>
    <li> very pretty. I love this mannequin. doesn&#x27;t shed. hair is average thickness. no complaints other than hair isn&#x27;t 16-17 in. it&#x27;s length looks just like the picture though!</li>
    <li> We originally bought this to practice doing braids &amp; hair buns for dance.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  Decent enough quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;  A lot of fun for our daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  the hair is feathered, so not ideal for braiding... not really a problem with the product, but not ideal for our application.</li>
    <li> this head really suck she hardly  has any hair and it doesn&#x27;t matter how much you wash it it has a bad odor to it.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for anyone who wants to learn how to do hair.  It&#x27;s great either for someone who wants to learn for personal interest or if they&#x27;re practicing for a career.  This hair feels real so practice is more realistic than with less professional models.  Plus it clamps onto tables or counters so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it tipping over while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
    <li> Great Hair, I Did Eexperience A Little Shedding When I Washed It And Also Styling. It Did Have Some Threads In It And Also Two Wires. Shipping Was Fast. I Was A Little Nervous About It Really Being Human Hair, But It&#x27;s Really Human Hair And It Does Have Some Gray Hairs. Overall I&#x27;m Satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Easter. She was wanting a mannequin head to practice makeup and hair designs. She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> Great hair for the price! Speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I just needed her for exam, she has a problum with thinning hair, and also she did not fit properly on my stand.</li>
    <li> Great price. Quality product.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this manikin head for her KY state boards.  She was disappointed in that it was a layered 90 degree haircut when she was expecting to be all one length/blunt cut.  It would have been helpful to have in the description it was already cut.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my 8 year old daughter.  It was  fine for her.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Hair was already cut in layers so there for when cutting the hair you had to cut a lot off</li>
    <li> She is a little thin.</li>
    <li> great for learning, the hair was a little shorter than I wanted though. Would be great to use for practicing perms or color applications.</li>
    <li> For a while I&#x27;ve been doing table top photography but recently decided to try some portraiture. Looking a many videos and reading a number of E books before I tried this I bought this manikin to experiment with different lighting setups. Initially using a few friends while I did this turned out to be a pain.  The results I got were good but they got tired of sitting around while I practiced.  The major advantage to the manikin is it doesn&#x27;t get bored, doesn&#x27;t have to be fed and doesn&#x27;t talk back.  When I do get done with this I give the manikin head to a local beauty school down the street.</li>
    <li> The hair count isn&#x27;t good enough so Its not at all easy to work with, if you purchasing these for school try to see if you school has better as these just didn&#x27;t cut right in the end.</li>
    <li> Works very well to practice different hair styles. Not as much hair as in the picture though, but it still works.</li>
    <li> the hair is only 5-6 inches not 16-17&lt;br /&gt;we may have to return them they are not what they say top of head only 5-6 inch hair</li>
