      <li>this Revlon Quite Pro is that the concentrator attachment seems to come off very easily.  </li>
      <li>the product was great the first time i used it</li>
      <li>item is OK, I like it</li>
      <li>Like I rated it--it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>Love all the options.</li>
      <li>How does a bald guy fall in love with a blow dryer?  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll make sure I get one that doesn&#x27;t have the noise when it arrives (which truthfully me to me is a defect that slipped by the quality checkers)</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it</li>
      <li>hairdryer is really cute, and I love the art deco look.  </li>
      <li>My $5 dryer from the dollar store works better than this.</li>
      <li>so gripping the dryer isn&#x27;t the easiest.</li>
      <li>Well in this revised review, the dryer was quickly and courteously replaced.</li>
      <li>the cute design is just a much appreciated added bonus!! :-)</li>
      <li>While drying my hair the attachment falls off easily and it seems to pop off while I am not using it, so every time I go to get it to use it</li>
      <li>I like the fact that the dryer is easy to handle.</li>
      <li>This replacement is nice but not as nice as old one.  </li>
      <li>The second one was perfect right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>Very nice unit and quiet on top of it.</li>
      <li>stopped blowing warm or hot air.  </li>
      <li>However, works fine as an every day hairdryer.</li>
      <li>I have medium length fine hair.</li>
      <li>and it still works fine with no sign of burning out.</li>
      <li>but it dries it just fine.</li>
      <li>My old hairdryer is a six-year-old T3 that is still going strong, but it&#x27;s fairly loud.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Had it in 2 days free shipping with our Prime</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic blow dryer.</li>
      <li>far so good, I have had this for about three months</li>
      <li>So I am going to have to be good about making sure it is clean on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>She wanted me say that she can style her hair now and it turns out pretty much like a salon styling, granted she uses a good styling product, but she used that before and never got these results.  </li>
      <li>Many of you using this on people would probably take off more stars for that, but in my case quiet was more a requirement  than powerful.  </li>
      <li>Theres nothing special about this.</li>
      <li>I would recommend something better but this is a decent cheap blow dryer.</li>
      <li>This still obviously has noise, but anything I can reduce is good.</li>
      <li>So that is true.</li>
      <li>I loved the color and the fact that it was so quiet that it didnt bother anyone else in the house.</li>
      <li>Very quiet... Good power</li>
      <li>My wife ordered this dryer and she said she has been looking for a dryer greater than 1875 watts thinking that&#x27;s what was needed to get a dryer that would put out some real heat.  </li>
      <li>It is much quieter than most dryers we hav e used over the years.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good hair dryer but not quiet.</li>
      <li>It still works fine, but the handle is sticky and kind of gross.</li>
      <li>it is a good hair dryer, quiet, doesn&#x27;t get real hot, dries hair fairly fast, light weight.</li>
      <li>It is very quiet, which is wonderful after our last noisy hairdryer!!</li>
      <li>Luckily I plugged it in to test it rather than just plugging in and leaving on counter.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased with the noise level of dryer,  or absence</li>
      <li>Ideally, one should be able to do an all over power dry on high/warm to get hair about 80% dry and then switch to low/hot for finishing and styling.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment, and works like a dream!!</li>
      <li>This one has a reasonable price and it works fine.</li>
      <li>78 and 79 were the two most consistent readings I got while using a high quality decibel reader (not an app).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is actually louder than the Revlon dryer I currently own.  </li>
      <li>and it will be worth it to keep buying them.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not as powerful as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>Nice to have different settings for speed AND heat.  </li>
      <li>Good quality, quiet and fast shipping</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is not drying my hair out like my old dryer.</li>
      <li>Love this model; moves air nicely and much more quietly than other high-pitched sounding dryers that leave my ears ringing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this to horse owners and people with fine hair.</li>
      <li>The other con to me is the bright color</li>
      <li>Like a bearing isn&#x27;t rolling right or something.</li>
      <li>This one went right in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What I love about it is it truly is much quieter than normal hair dryers</li>
      <li>it is super quiet and not that high-pitched ear splitting that most hairdryers have.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair quite as fast, but it does put out a good bit of heat.</li>
      <li>The first one came with the noise right out of the box</li>
      <li>But I do find that it takes longer to dry my hair on the warm setting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s double the price of many hair dryers and absolutely worth it.</li>
      <li>This blow dryer is the best it is so quiet you don&#x27;t have to feel like you are blowing the whole house down when you are using it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had this blow dryer for about a year. I loved the color and the fact that it was so quiet that it didnt bother anyone else in the house. I wish it hadnt died. It did take longer for my hair to dry. I would recommend something better but this is a decent cheap blow dryer.</li>
    <li> How does a bald guy fall in love with a blow dryer?  He has a wife who is an early, early riser and a master bathroom not too far from where he is getting his beauty rest.  The blow dryer his wife uses is usually as loud as the turbine engine on a Boeing 747 so his beauty rest is rudely interrupted and his life is suffering because of it.&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, he buys the wife a new blow dryer for Christmas, much to her surprise as she says hers works fine.  He asks her to give it a try and he can&#x27;t believe his ears when she uses it....he barely hears a whisper out of the thing!&lt;br /&gt;Out of the hundreds of products he has bought on Amazon this could top the list in actually doing what it is supposed to do.  All he asks is that it keeps quiet, gets hot and blows....yes, we&#x27;re still talking about the dryer here, get your minds out of the gutter people!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product for your mate and get some sleep!</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer!  It is very quiet, which is wonderful after our last noisy hairdryer!!</li>
    <li> It is very quiet compared to my old dryer.  One thing I would have liked is the retractable cord.</li>
    <li> Excellent hairdryer.  I really love the idea that is so much more quiet than any other I have had.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer is very quiet (on high it sounds like how other dryers sound on low) and works fine, but the paint on the handle seems to have melted away after only a few weeks of use. I don&#x27;t use any product in my hair, so I&#x27;m not sure what is causing the paint to melt. It still works fine, but the handle is sticky and kind of gross.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I have. Used to take me an hour to blow dry and straighten my hair. Bow it takes me less than 20</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic blow dryer. It is MUCH quieter than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve come across. I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair well, but that is definitely not a concern. It does a fast job of drying my normal to thick straight hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works very well is quiet ,like advertised.I am a man using this my hair is shot so it dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting. I am using this at 4:30 in the morning and no one in my house hears it,as opposed to my old one.Two very small nitpicks ,I wish it came in a different color, and I wish you could screw in the front piece.Hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Very quiet.</li>
    <li> I needed a quiet drier to dry a sweaty horse after a workout prior to being let out into very cold weather.  Horses can get pretty spooked by scary, unfamiliar sounds, and when they do,  chances are the person holding the scary noisy thing is going to get kicked or at the very least have an unruly 1200 lb animal to deal with. This drier gets 4 stars for not spooking my horse.  It lost a star due to not having a lot of power.  Many of you using this on people would probably take off more stars for that, but in my case quiet was more a requirement  than powerful.  While my horse was pretty cool with it on the VERY quiet low setting, He did get a tad nervous on the high setting  before adjusting to the higher pitch.  Highly recommend this to horse owners and people with fine hair. Sorry to the rest of you who need more power.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is definitely quieter than my previous dryer. It does the job however my previous hair dryer was an 1875 watt dryer and more powerful than this model.</li>
    <li> UPDATE April 2016 This dryer is still in perfect working order, and I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;So far so good, I have had this for about three months and it still works fine with no sign of burning out. I had not bought a dryer in many years and it is CRAZY how much some of them cost! This one has a reasonable price and it works fine. It is certainly the quietest blow dryer I have ever had, which makes a bigger difference than I thought it would. It does not come with a diffuser attachment, but the Revlon RV480 universal diffuser fits it and stays on.  One star off for truly crappy placement of the heat and on/off switches on the handle right where you grip it, and for its large size. Perhaps it needs to be as big and long as it is to be quiet, but it is big and heavy and a bit awkward to get used to. I had been using a travel size dryer for years though, so if you are used to full sized dryers this may not seem awkward to you at all.&lt;br /&gt;If my review was useful to you, please take a sec and and hit the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button - thanks!</li>
    <li> works;  inexpensive but does not work as well as the $100 dryer that was quieter and faster.  on the plus side it is much lighter than the expensive dryer.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this hairdryer if you think it is going to be &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34;.  It is actually louder than the Revlon dryer I currently own.  Not sure how it can claim to be 50% quieter but there is obviously a reason it is not longer stocked in stores.  However, works fine as an every day hairdryer.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this dryer and she said she has been looking for a dryer greater than 1875 watts thinking that&#x27;s what was needed to get a dryer that would put out some real heat.  Not so!  This dryer puts out HEAT, but it so quiet at the same time - she absolutely loves it.  She wanted me say that she can style her hair now and it turns out pretty much like a salon styling, granted she uses a good styling product, but she used that before and never got these results.  The difference, she thinks, is the added heat this dryer puts out.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought was very quiet and worked just fine for over a year, and then it suddenly stopped blowing warm or hot air, only cool air.  So I bought another one and in three weeks, it did the same thing  --  stopped blowing warm or hot air.  But I noticed that I had not cleaned the air vents and they were clogged with dust, which probably caused the thermostat to burn out.  So now I&#x27;m on my third one, and so far it is working fine (knock on wood), and this time I&#x27;m being very careful to keep the air vents clear.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is MUCH quieter than any others I&#x27;ve had previously and does a good job drying my hair. I&#x27;m glad I found it and my housemates are too.</li>
    <li> This dryer is so quiet that you would think that it would not dry fast - but it dries very well.  I like the fact that the dryer is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Very quiet, but dries as quickly as a louder dryer.  Very pleased with the noise level of dryer,  or absence thereof!</li>
    <li> It is very quiet but it didn&#x27;t last very long.  The motor started making noise about 2 months after purchase.  This may be because you can&#x27;t clean the little lint trap in the back, it&#x27;s not removeable</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works great and is relatively quiet compared to other ones I have had in the past. Love all the options.</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these.  I like quiet hair dryers and I&#x27;ve tried three different brands. This is the best deal I think. The thing with the two that I&#x27;ve had of this brand is that they get a bit of a rattle/whirring after a while.  Like a bearing isn&#x27;t rolling right or something. The fans and heat are working still.  The second one was used for about 150 hours before the loudness made it not &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; anymore.  The first one came with the noise right out of the box but it was low enough to be equivalent to my previous dryer, which was three times as expensive.  The second one was perfect right out of the box.  For the first time I heard how quiet these can be and it is pretty darn quiet. Especially at the low setting of course.  Real nice.  So, I figure from now on I&#x27;ll make sure I get one that doesn&#x27;t have the noise when it arrives (which truthfully me to me is a defect that slipped by the quality checkers) and it will be worth it to keep buying them.</li>
    <li> After purchasing 5 dryers from local stores and being extremely disappointed in the \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; as advertised, I was ecstatic at the first use of this product! Even on high speed, the dryer does not require ear plugs as in even the high priced models. This one is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how many ions were delivered from this item!  I mean, I was awash in ions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, they were sometimes warm, sometimes cold ions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And...wait...hold on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pulling the rip-cord...I just feel ridiculous writing a review for a hair dryer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;apologies, eveyone.</li>
    <li> SO much more quiet than our current high-performance hair dryer. Love this model; moves air nicely and much more quietly than other high-pitched sounding dryers that leave my ears ringing.</li>
    <li> wife bought this at a local Ultra about a year ago...it was fading...wanted another....and I told her I&#x27;d check Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sure enough...it was cheaper by a good amount and on Prime!  Had it in 2 days free shipping with our Prime account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, she says this dryer is better than either of the 2 chi driers she spent hundreds on in the past.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer really is quite compared to my last one. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair quite as fast, but it does put out a good bit of heat. The straight hair attachment piece doesn&#x27;t want to stay on, but I don&#x27;t find that it is very helpful. The only thing I am worried about in the long run, is there is no way to clean out the air intake. So I am going to have to be good about making sure it is clean on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this hair dryer, it is not that quiet, and the cool blast button does not work really well. Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad the hair dryer is as quiet as I expected. With the bathroom connected to two bedrooms, I need something that won&#x27;t wake my family. The only reason I give it 4/5 stars is because the handle and toggle buttons are awfully small. I am blessed with larger than average hands for a woman so gripping the dryer isn&#x27;t the easiest.</li>
    <li> The product is as expected&lt;br /&gt;This item is OK, I like it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everybody&lt;br /&gt;This product is good quality</li>
    <li> I had one of these for YEARS, dropped it and broke it!  I was heartbroken.  Had a VERY DIFFICULT time finding one this QUIET again!! Love, love, love this hairdryer!! Fast shipment, and works like a dream!!</li>
    <li> The red paint smears off very badly almost like it is bleeding. Dryer is not any quieter than another one that doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer about 5 years ago. A few months ago, it started overheating/smelling weird. I threw it in the trash and got another. What I love about it is it truly is much quieter than normal hair dryers but it still really dries your hair. I get migraines constantly, so having something extra loud near my ears is not helpful. This still obviously has noise, but anything I can reduce is good. I&#x27;ll probably by a third one in another 5 years.</li>
    <li> It is for sure more quiet than my old dryer, It also makes my hair feel so soft unlike my old dryer. I love the fact that it is not drying my hair out like my old dryer.</li>
    <li> I did not like this hair dryer when I first started using it. I didn&#x27;t think that it had a fast enough air flow. Now I am used to it and I like it. It dries my hair about 25% faster than my old hair dryer, not the 50% faster they manufacturer claims.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer sucks. I have medium length fine hair. It takes me more than 10 minutes to get my head fully dry. And then my hair feels like I&#x27;ve just stuck it out of the window of a moving car to dry it. Straw and oily. My $5 dryer from the dollar store works better than this. Not enough power, not enough heat, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good quality, quiet and fast shipping</li>
    <li> When read the advertisement sounds like the noise es really low, but no, still makes some noise that bothers, sorry.</li>
    <li> I think this hair dryer works well.  It is quiet. It dries my hair fairly fast, I use hot and high.  The air does not get real hot and it seems to be light weight,  of course, I only need to hold it for a few minutes and my hair is dry.  I purchased this because I had lost the concentrator attachment for my old hair dryer and for my new hair style I need the concentrator.  My old dryer was several years old and it was the only dryer we had in the house so now I have it as a back up.  The only con about this Revlon Quite Pro is that the concentrator attachment seems to come off very easily.  While drying my hair the attachment falls off easily and it seems to pop off while I am not using it, so every time I go to get it to use it I need to attach the concentrator again.  The other con to me is the bright color, of course, that is a little picky thing to me, I would just prefer a more neutral color like silver or black.  I would like to have a place to hang it by the black rubber hanging ring but I haven&#x27;t discussed that with the husband (don&#x27;t know if he would have a place to put a hook).  And then if it&#x27;s hanging and the attachment keeps falling off that would be a pain depending where I would be hanging it.  All in all it is a good hair dryer, quiet, doesn&#x27;t get real hot, dries hair fairly fast, light weight.</li>
    <li> With this hair dryer took me about an hour to dry my hair what usually takes me about 30 min with old conair infiniti pro hair dryer, also i did not like the side motor or air flow just because i like to blow my hair stand up and i like to hold with my knees by doing this the sides did not get too much air flow and makes think that my new blower it going to burnt up. Honestly i hate turn on and off hair dryers i think would last longer if i dont turn it off while i blowing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing about quietness when i turned on gives me a little vibration and it is not loud as other hair dryers but vibration thing kills me reason why i returned</li>
    <li> Wanted a hair dryer that was not too loud and this one does the trick.  Now my husband can blow dry his hair in the morning and not wake me with the loud noise our other hair dryer makes.  Oh and my hearing is getting better no more overly loud noise to contend with.</li>
    <li> This is indeed quieter than my previous hairdryer. But I do find that it takes longer to dry my hair on the warm setting. It dries fairly quick on high, but that&#x27;s not ideal for keeping ones hair healthy (the hot is really hot). Ideally, one should be able to do an all over power dry on high/warm to get hair about 80% dry and then switch to low/hot for finishing and styling. That said, I&#x27;ll sacrifice the slightly longer drying time for a quieter dryer.</li>
    <li> This worked great for 30 days but died on day 31 and can no longer be returned. I would not recommend this hair dryer. I would give it a 0 star rating but 1 star is the lowest allowed. Very disappointed..</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve had, but it is the quietest dryer in it&#x27;s price range. First one lasted about a year before burning out.</li>
    <li> Product worked great for 1 month. Then yesterday the heater stopped working and it no longer blows hot air.</li>
    <li> This only seems under-powered because it is so quiet.  If you want quiet, this is the one.  It took me about two days to get used to the difference in balance from my old hair dryer.  It felt top heavy to me, but the sweet hum and the shiny finish it gave my hair made it worth the effort.  It dries my hair just as quickly as the old, noisy one did.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to wake my wife every morning with a high-pitched whining blower. This blower does the trick and is quite quiet. The secret to the quiet is the low fan speed. Blows hot at a slow speed but considering I don&#x27;t have that much hair anymore, it does fine! The fan blade rattles a little so I will see how it holds up over time.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a quiet hair dryer. This one is not more quiet than other ones. It&#x27;s a good hair dryer but not quiet.</li>
    <li> Advertised as 1875 watts but is only 1600. It was terrible, not enough power to dry my thick hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I have never been disappointed by a Revlon product and this hair dryer is no different. A Good Quality product inside and out. Love the color too!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works well.  Everything is promised to be.  I like the hair dryer and recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this hair dryer is quiet (as in you can sleep through it) but it is definitely quieter than most.</li>
    <li> for the price, this is a great blow dryer. Purchased as a gift for my sister for Christmas.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry as good as you expect it to dry. I&#x27;m returning it since it&#x27;s quality is not the best.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer has adequate power and is much quieter than my previous one. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this since 10 Sept, hardly used it everyday and today when I tried to plug it in, the whole plug box disintegrated!  Little pieces of black plastic all over the bathroom.  And its 10 days too late to return!</li>
    <li> I like the lower noise factor, but that comes with a sacrifice on power/velocity.  takes much longer to dry hair.</li>
    <li> Had one of this Revlon type for many years that finally stopped heating sufficiently.  This replacement is nice but not as nice as old one.  But it works just doesn&#x27;t seem quite as quiet.</li>
    <li> Very nice unit and quiet on top of it. Spend a few pennies more and improve your quality of life.</li>
    <li> No quieter than my old hairdryer and less powerful. Not really what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) It dries my hair relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s quiet, considering it&#x27;s an 1875W hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;3) It includes a concentrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The concentrator falls off at the slightest accidental touch and bounces all around my bathroom counters and floor, then is usually pretty hot to put back on straightaway. Seriously, Revlon, your designers couldn&#x27;t have figured out a way to attach the concentrator more securely? Most people don&#x27;t appreciate hot, out of control attachments when they&#x27;re trying to dry their hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Bought this for my wife for Christmas and the noise level is night and day different! For those that say it&#x27;s not quiet, not sure what you are hearing but it&#x27;s not this dryer!</li>
    <li> It is somewhat quiet-not silent, but the power of the air isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like.  It is good otherwise.</li>
    <li> the hair dryer itself does not burn up so you can hold it however way you feel like, i love the cooling setting, and as far as noise it does make noise but its definitely not as loud but i still close my door when i use it but nobody complains</li>
    <li> Much quieter than regular dryers. May take a person with thick hair a tad longer to dry since this doesn&#x27;t push a ton of air, which is why it is quiet. Leaves my hair looking shiny and I love that it isn&#x27;t deafening in the bathroom while I do my hair!</li>
    <li> Very quiet... Good power</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one in my home. We bought the first one from Target and we found it&#x27;s really quiet. And switch of another Revlon brand dryer fall apart, we ordered another from Amazon. We like it.</li>
    <li> So may hair dryers almost require ear protection to use.  Tis one is well built, very quiet for,a hair dryer especially on low speed.  It&#x27;s double the price of many hair dryers and absolutely worth it.</li>
    <li> While this dryer is quiet, it does not dry. I spent half an hour working on one half of my head before saying screw it and using my sister&#x27;s Conair hair dryer. Within minutes my hair was dry. I don&#x27;t have especially thick hair, but it is long. This is just unacceptable. This one went right in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A giant waste of money.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is the best it is so quiet you don&#x27;t have to feel like you are blowing the whole house down when you are using it.</li>
    <li> Asked for this dryer for Christmas and my husband bought it for me. We have a 3 month old daughter and i thought this would be great since it advertised 50% quieter. I had to use my old dryer in the spare bathroom all the way on the far side of our house to avoid waking the baby! This dryer is much quieter than my old one. So that is true. BUT...it is also LESS POWERFUL. It takes me so long to dry my hair and it is only shoulder length! I would not recommend this dryer. I have gone back to my old dryer because i do not have an extra 20 minutes to spare in the mornings just for the sake of a quieter blow dry.</li>
    <li> All this is , is looks.  Sorry but that&#x27;s my opinion.  OThers like it because its quiet, but Thank God I have no kids to worry about waking up.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my wife because every morning I would wake up to the high powered screeching of her old hair dryer.  I usually was able to fall back asleep but it was still annoying. I was also getting tired of her saying &amp;#34;huh?&amp;#34; Or &amp;#34;what?&amp;#34; every time I talked to her (even after the hair dryer was off). She seems to like this hair dryer. I think it takes her a little longer to dry her hair but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for your hearing. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; but it just isn&#x27;t as loud as your average hair dryer.</li>
    <li> No power...takes longer to dry.</li>
    <li> Not as loud as other hair dryers</li>
    <li> flash deal for black Friday paid 11 for it and it was shipped super fast. The blow dryer is quieter that others but I find it a bit heavy but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Amazon is sending a replacement.  Luckily I plugged it in to test it rather than just plugging in and leaving on counter.  Immediately began to smoke and output end got so hot you couldn&#x27;t touch in just a few second.  I had told my son about the purchase and we were going to see just how quiet it would be.  Son laughs and says \\&quot;wow it is quiet\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It is lightweight but not very powerful. It is definitely not for professional use. Short cord. No speedy blow dry here.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for two reasons, one because it is quiet and two for the support of breast cancer, this product is junk! do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> My wife and I -- So i can sleep  and the dogs love this&lt;br /&gt;No noise and drys here hair faster !&lt;br /&gt;This is a great Buy</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this hairdryer. Sell us as 1875w but in reality is 1600 (so slow) and not reduce the noise as per announced.</li>
    <li> Nice to have different settings for speed AND heat.  It is much quieter than most dryers we hav e used over the years.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Quiet, but less airflow. I would still have given good marks but the bearings failed after just a couple weeks and I have to return it. I&#x27;ll try a higher end one now.</li>
    <li> Far less noisy and works well.</li>
    <li> LOUDNESS:&lt;br /&gt;Daily exposure of anything over 90 decibels in loudness can cause permanent hearing damage (and I&#x27;ve heard 80 stated as well), so I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled to find a quiet hairdryer that is actually below 80 when in high mode.  78 and 79 were the two most consistent readings I got while using a high quality decibel reader (not an app).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOOKS:&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer is really cute, and I love the art deco look.  The stripes that look to be silver metal in the photo are actually a gray plastic, but it&#x27;s still really cute.  I got it for the quiet factor anyway, so the cute design is just a much appreciated added bonus!! :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because I already owned one and I wanted another for a travel spare.  I&#x27;ve had to duct tape the diffuser to the end of the dryer because it always falls off.  Otherwise, I like the dryer, it&#x27;s quiet and dependable.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to be so quiet but I love it. It dried my hair fast and it&#x27;s quiet at night or in mornings.</li>
    <li> I replaced my noisy Babyliss with this.  What a difference!  I love the hot pink color as well!  That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Super quiet.  Not sure about power.  I have a lot of long thick hair but it dries it just fine.</li>
    <li> The first thing my husband said when he saw me using this hairdryer is \\&quot;is that thing even working?\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s so quiet you wouldn&#x27;t think it was.  My only issue is that it&#x27;s mislabeled on Amazon - it&#x27;s actually a 1600W hairdryer so it&#x27;s not as powerful as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> This dryer lives up to it&#x27;s name - much quieter than my old dryer and a pleasure to use.  It is light and feels like a professional dryer.  The only down side is that it dosen&#x27;t seem as powerful as an 1875 watt dryer should be.  Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s quiet, it also has absolutely no power. I&#x27;ve had to run out of my house with a head full of half-dried hair multiple times because it takes so long to dry it. I&#x27;m returning this shiz tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I do like it for what it for its quietness.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like, however, that the nozzle piece does not attach well and it keeps falling off. I tried putting electric tape to keep it attached, but I would not recommended because it started to melt it and made the tip of the hairdryer expand.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant after reading reviews, I needed a quiet blow dryer so as not to disturb my husband in the morning, this is definitely quiet and dries my hair just as quick as others. Lover the color too</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. Nice and quiet and lasted for years but too hard to clean to buy another.</li>
    <li> the product was great the first time i used it but then I went to use it again and it started blowing cold air...a blow dryer isnt supposed to do that and unfortunately its passed the deadline for me to return it so I&#x27;m very upset about this.</li>
    <li> Works very well and very quiet. Feels very solid and well made. Probably gets a bit too hot, so user must modify the way in which it is used to avoid skin burns</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is so much quieter than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. It lived up to my expectations. I hope Revlon continues to manufacture this model. I bought this one as my reserve.</li>
    <li> I LOVE how quiet this hair dryer is. The amount of air it pushes it significantly less than my last hair dryer, which works okay for me because my hair is fine. The hot setting is almost too hot. I find I use the low heat more than I used to on my old hair dryer. It takes a little adjusting but having it so much more quiet makes it all worthwhile. Overall, I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Theres nothing special about this. It did say leaa noise et al but i dont see any difference in comparison to any other. However does its job well.</li>
    <li> Successfully does what it claims. Lower noise to save your ears. Power/force is less than desired, but keeping your hearing is worth drying your hair a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I initially wrote that the nozzle on this dryer won&#x27;t stay on and wanted to return it. Well in this revised review, the dryer was quickly and courteously replaced. The new one works great!! No complaints and it works as advertised. It is much quieter than other dryers and works well. There was obviously a small flaw in the nozzle on the first one I received. This one is awesome.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is light and quiet.  It dries my medium length thick hair as quickly as other dryers I have had.  I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> The dryer is really quiet.  I have another Revlon dryer that seems to wine when on.... and this one is really quiet.  However just like on  a previous review, the attachment concentrator comes off easy.</li>
    <li> Awesome. I can&#x27;t sleep now</li>
    <li> Still fairly loud, the on/off switch is down by your hand, so you hit it alot shutting it off while using</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
    <li> Works well, light and quiet.  The reason for 3 stars is that we&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 months and there is already a buzzing sound, like something is wrong with the motor.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the performance, but annoying.</li>
    <li> A friend started talking to me about hearing damage. It occurred to me that I blow dry my hair every day, so I thought I should go looking for a quieter dryer.  My old hairdryer is a six-year-old T3 that is still going strong, but it&#x27;s fairly loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought there was no way this could be quieter and faster.  It&#x27;s both.  It doesn&#x27;t smooth hair as well, but it&#x27;s about a third faster than a T3, and it is definitely quieter. (It&#x27;s very hot--which may be why it works so well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s pretty amazing for 25% of the price of a more expensive dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sent it back. Plugged it in, turned it on and sounds exactly like my current dryer that is not advertised as quiet.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ, plus it&#x27;s so quiet. A very nice dryer at a great price!!!!!</li>
    <li> the diffuser does not click in and will fall off with the lightest hit. it drove me insane.&lt;br /&gt;but it is super quiet and not that high-pitched ear splitting that most hairdryers have. however it only lasted 6 months.the heat element conked out.  thankfully they will be replacing it though.</li>
    <li> Like I rated it--it&#x27;s okay.  It is much more quiet than my old Revlon.  The air control attachment won&#x27;t stay on.  If I were to do it again, I would probably choose another brand.</li>
</ol>
