<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wish it was easier to find and not so expensive cause its the only body spray I liked to use</li>
    <li> The price was very reasonable for this product, and it shipped out quickly. While it does smell nice, it seems to lack some of the quality I remember from purchases I had made previously. It may just be me, but I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying the same thing.</li>
    <li> So hard to find. It is the best smelling body spray in the world</li>
    <li> I love this product...it&#x27;s no longer in stores and I don&#x27;t understand why...it seems to smell a little different but my family says it still smells great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Dove Go Fresh Energizing Body Mist.  It has an uplifting, elegant scent.  It is always commented to me that I smell good; however, I hate that Dove has discontinued this product!  There is no other scent like it.</li>
    <li> This is the exact product that was sold in stores.  I opted for the free Supersaver Shipping and my package arrived 3 days after I ordered it.  The six spray bottles were shrink wrapped in plastic like they would be from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments from men and women alike when I use this spray.  The women say I smell very clean like I just stepped out of the shower.  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> I like other products from the Dove &amp;#34;Go Fresh&amp;#34; line of products (especially the deodorant) so I thought I would give this a try.  I&#x27;m basically pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Nice, clean, fresh scent (doesn&#x27;t exactly remind me of grapefruit, but the blend of fragrances is pleasant)&lt;br /&gt;*Non-irritating and non-drying (I have sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;*Can be sprayed on skin or clothes and doesn&#x27;t stain (although I have not tried spraying it on white or light-colored clothes)&lt;br /&gt;*Product can be stored in the bottle for a long time (years, even) without breaking down or separating&lt;br /&gt;*Scent is not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;*Great for touch-ups when you might break a *light* sweat but don&#x27;t have time for a shower (like climbing up a bunch of stairs or carrying boxes around at work)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Scent is not super-long lasting; I can detect it for maybe a couple of hours after use, but it does not last all day&lt;br /&gt;*Contains a couple of artificial colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this body spray has a lot of benefits for a product in this price range.  I&#x27;m about 2/3 through the bottle I bought and I will most likely purchase more when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Used the spray first, then bought the deodorant, really feel refreshed after shower. smells  Clean, crisp..have been so frustrated to not find in stores, that once carried the Grapefruit&amp;Lemongrass... Dove mfg, rethink this scent..was not a smart move to take it from customers</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents from Dove body spray. Too bad you cannot find them in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SUCH I NICE SUMMER SCENT TO HAVE. I LOVE TO SPRAY ON RIGHT AFTER THE SHOWER AND BEFORE BED. MY FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> bought this for the wife she absolutly loves it.the pack has 6 bottles so thats enough to last for a while will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Love this product but is now unavailable</li>
    <li> This scent is everything that it says, Energizing. A perfect pick me up when you feel tired, but still need to keep on going. Please keep this product on the market.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is fresh and the slightest bit sweet, perfect for summer. They are the same size I would buy in the drug store. I keep one in my purse and one at work. Happy with my purchase, good price.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the original Dove go fresh scent this is not it. Its much more powerful and a tad old lady smelling IMO. I was disappointed because I REALLY liked this product. I wish Dove would bring it back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway If you are a fan of the original scent I would look elsewhere, Cause this is NOTHING like it. my guess is the seller saved the bottles and filled them up with something MUCH cheaper! Dont waste your money like I did!</li>
    <li> So glad I found this!!! I was super sad when they discontinued but now I&#x27;m thrilled to use my fave body spray once more! Yay!</li>
    <li> I love this dove body spray it has such a fresh and invigorating scent. I have purchased this before from my local CVS but when I come upon this on Amazon I got a way better deal as far price/quantity. This spray has a lemongrass/grapefruit scent which is stimulating and clean. I&#x27;m not really a floral type of chick (floral gives me a headache) so this for me is more earthy and natural. So ladies if your looking for something new I would recommend giving this a try. My hubby loves the scent as well. I have always loved Dove products.</li>
    <li> I really have e all dove body mist. I was not happy at all that dove decided not to have this product in stores.</li>
    <li> The best body spray ever. It&#x27;s smells very fresh and clean. The fragrance lasts all day. I was on a mission to find  searching everywhere and Amazon was the only place that had it.</li>
    <li> This product (scent) has been discontinued, it smells so clean/fresh I always get compliments, thank you for making this available</li>
    <li> Love this spray. I&#x27;m so glad you still had some in stock.</li>
    <li> i like this as my wife never uses any other body  spray above all its  nice aroma makes a fresh feeling</li>
    <li> These are discontinued in stores and I&#x27;ve looked literally everywhere online and in stores to find it since mine was running out. for the last few months ive been adding water to the one had left to attempt at continuing to use it!! i&#x27;m so glad i found it and i like  the new packaging it comes in (the bottle is more square than the rounded one in the photo, still the same amount of product though). now that i have 6 bottles i will never run out. :)</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t available in stores anymore, so I am glad it&#x27;s obtainable online. This stuff smells better than any of the (VERY) expensive perfumes my wife has bought in the past.</li>
    <li> absolutley obsessed with this scent! its fresh and clean and wears well all day. i havent met anybody who doesnt love it.&lt;br /&gt;i was devastated when i saw them disapearing from stores. finally took the plunge and bought a six pack of the spray off amazon. no regrets!</li>
    <li> smells so fresh,love this particular scent and glad i could find it here</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as advertised and works perfectly. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I loved this scent when it first came out and was so disappointed when they stopped stocking it in the stores.  I searched everywhere to find it,  So happy to find it online for about the same price i was paying.  If you like clean fresh scents then you will love this body mist.  Plus I always get compliments about how good I smell.</li>
    <li> We love this. The whole family uses it now.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this scent for a couple of years locally and had no luck. I love the fresh scent and am very happy to have found it again. Smells exactly like I remember!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t even wear perfume but reach for this instead. I have it in my car, my tanning bag, at work, one upstairs in the house and one downstairs HAHA! Everyone comments on the smell and wants to know what it is and where to get it!</li>
    <li> This products is truly what it claims to be. The scent last for hours many hours after your initial spray.</li>
    <li> Has the cleanest summery scent and I just love it!! It is not overpowering either like some sprays can be.</li>
    <li> love the scent, fragrance lasts all day, not overwhelming if you use several sprays but doesn&#x27;t need more than a couple sprays.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in the drugstore, but can&#x27;t find it anymore.  I love it, it smells so light, fresh and clean.  Only place I found it was on Amazon.  Thank goodness.  If you like it, stock up, it may not be around long.</li>
    <li> I was elated to find my favourite body spray on this site!! Have not been able to find it in the stores for about a year now!! It has a very clean and fresh smell. I love love love it.</li>
    <li> Loved the scent, wish I could order more</li>
    <li> This Dove Energizing Body Fragrance that i bought smells like the real deal except that the fragrance does not last as long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my most favorite scent. Perfect for refreshing mist, or if you need to cover up a poo smell in the (public) bathroom works wonders. I love it. Now, that I know I can get it here, I will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> So sorry I bought a big 6 pack...  I even used some in the bathroom for a spritz of &amp;#34;room deodarant&amp;#34; and a little spritz at that, and my son was like &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some on me, (the idea afterall) and it gave me a headache, and I felt anything but fresh or Energized!  Very disappointed !!</li>
    <li> This body mist is refreshing after a shower.  It has a clean, pleasant scent without being overpowering.  I was disappointed to find that the drugstores are not carrying it anymore, but was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought the 6 pack of these bottles. I will probably cry when I run out of it. lol</li>
    <li> I keep a bottle in my bathroom, dance bag, even purse sometimes.  I wear perfumes, etc. but it&#x27;s so fresh and clean-smelling, that even if I spritz it on after a workout or just to freshen-up, I always get compliments.  Dove, please bring this back - I&#x27;m getting nervous it&#x27;s going to be totally gone, soon!</li>
    <li> Nice, light, fresh scent!</li>
    <li> So happy to find this product!! The energizing scent was by far my favorite of the Dove Go Fresh line and I was so sad when it was discontinued. Happy to find this product on amazon.</li>
    <li> always have enjoyed this product -  thank you</li>
    <li> Love the scent! I already made a report when i received the package,and even sent a picture of it but no corrective action was made. 2 or 3 bottles were slightly opened that&#x27;s why the content spilled affecting other stuff that i bought. I have no evidence now since i deleted the pictures that was taken early last year...</li>
    <li> Great product, don&#x27;t know why the took it out the stores.</li>
    <li> I love the full crisp scent of this product. Evidently others do also. When I wear this product, friends as well as strangers inquire \\&quot;What is that lovely scent?\\&quot; It always lifts my spirits to apply it and I also often use it in my bed linens just to please myself. Everytime I wear Dove go fresh Energizing Body Mist, I just feel better. After much searching I was glad to find my favorite on Amazon. Needless to say, I stocked up and am glad I did!</li>
    <li> This is NOT the original scent from Dove in the containers.  I&#x27;ve been using this product bought from stores and as I was getting low on my last 2 bottles (home and travel) I looked for them in stores but couldn&#x27;t find this scent.  The original or REAL product has a strong scent that is refreshing.  What came in the containers was not even a hint of the scent but rather an alcohol mist.  I will assume that it was reconstituted with the essence of the original inside the container.  I am returning this product and reporting it as fraud.</li>
