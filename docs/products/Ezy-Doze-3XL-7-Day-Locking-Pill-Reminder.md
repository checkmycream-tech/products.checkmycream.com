<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This thing is very large. I didn&#x27;t realize just how big it was before ordering, but it&#x27;s larger than I needed it to be. I take 5 very large vitamins/supplements a day and this could fit a whole lot more. Seems pretty durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a locking mechanism which is a nice feature. You have to push a button on the side of the container to open any of the lids (might be annoying if you don&#x27;t want to deal with that), but it prevents any accidental openings.</li>
    <li> I take a lot of supplements and only the largest pill containers have worked for me.  Unfortunately, they all have come open in my luggage until this one.  The size for each day&#x27;s pills is as large as the largest I&#x27;d used prior to this one, yet this is studier and virtually bulletproof in its ability to not accidentally come open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the pill dispenser you&#x27;ve been trying to find!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3XL Ezy Doze 7 Day Pill reminder for my husband because he has such large hands. The system is large enough that he can easily use it.</li>
    <li> I take a lot of meds, and after a near-tragic accident with my toddler daughter accessing my meds in a normal pill case, this pill box, does the job.  Even though she is old enough to &amp;#34;know better&amp;#34; I still feel better with that extra security....easy enough to unlatch yourself, but not to others if not seen (of course they can figure it out if they try).  One caveat with this box....if it is dropped (and I drop it a lot unfortunately), even though the compartments are &amp;#34;locked&amp;#34; they will a lot of times open up on impact and you will be on the ground trying to find, then take inventory of your pills.  Just be careful with it and you have a good product.</li>
    <li> My fault, I guess. BUT I&#x27;VE NEVER SEEN A PILL BOX SO HUGE!!!!!!!! Read the dimensions before you pay $10 for this thing. It&#x27;s not worth sending back.</li>
    <li> This pill holder is ENORMOUS! I like having a lot of extra room but even with all of my supplements and vitamins there is still a huge amount of room. I did not receive the blue version. Mine is clear which is alright although I would have preferred the blue one</li>
    <li> I bought this because I travel a lot.  It helps me organize my meds.  It is very large.  Larger than I expected.  I would probably order a smaller size if I were to do it over again (I should have paid more attention to the dimensions, not their fault).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Works exactly as intended&lt;br /&gt;- Each container holds 30 or more pills of about any size I could imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty difficult to open the containers when you need in.&lt;br /&gt;Square shape makes is a little difficult to get pills out of container.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly bulky for travel storage</li>
    <li> This is a good product for keeping all your supplements organized for daily use. The only issue is that the locking mechanism is a subtle at first</li>
    <li> I often travel for 2 weeks or more. This will hold ALL my medications and supplements. Its very sturdy and ez to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s huge! It takes all my daily vitamin tablets, they&#x27;re 12 tablets in total and they fit very comfortably without having to jam them. And it also has a nice lock from the side, in case you have kids...</li>
    <li> Extremely difficult to open</li>
    <li> This great for the many pill I take everyday</li>
    <li> Works perfect. Holds all my pills. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Not being a very smart man, it took me a few minutes to learn how to unlock it. But once I got it figured out, it works great.</li>
    <li> This item is awesome.  It holds are of my pills and locks which is the best part as you can avoid the case opening and the pills falling out.  Get this you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Ezy Doze 3XL 7 Day Locking Pill Reminder, the lock works fine. I did fine they were  bigger than I thought they would be.  Now I have plenty of room for my pills and they will not fall out when I travel.</li>
    <li> Well, I needed a large container but this was overkill. I&#x27;d just as soon have it not be locking but it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> These would of been perfect but too large. Very hard to compare them to what I was looking for. Had to try and open product to find sizes.</li>
    <li> was way too big till I started using it.  love the size now.</li>
    <li> I bought these but they were too big.  I use it now to put small items in it for when I travel and it works great.  The product arrived on time and was packaged very well. There was no damage to the product and the product is made with good quality material. I will buy from this seller again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The size is great- basically it&#x27;s just huge! This is the only pill box i have bought to date that can keep powdered supplements</li>
    <li> Yes, this is a big one.  Perfect if you have a lot of supplements or pills to take.&lt;br /&gt;Each of the seven compartments is this size&lt;br /&gt;50mm x 33mm x 25 mm tall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lock works easily and without fail.  I was tired of cramming my vitamins into a small holder and some of the large holders pop open in my backpack.  This one will stay shut for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lock requires you to press a plastic bar down while you open the intended compartment.  The lock slides back into place as soon as you release it, preventing the other compartments from spilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy.  This is the largest 7 day dispenser I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> Shipper proactively kept me abreast of delivery times.  Delivery was on time or before.  This, was a gift for a friend diagnosed with Lupus, who was having a hard time organizing 20+ meds per day.  She was so happy with the easy open and closure that I ordered her a third dispenser. My experience was exceptional.</li>
    <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t show it&#x27;s true size, it&#x27;s pretty big! I love it!! For me it holds two fish oils, three vitamin size pills, a blood pressure pill, sleeping pill....and so on. I think you get the idea. Check the measurements section of the ad, it&#x27;s a really good size and has a great locking mechanism that keeps my three year old out of opening them if he ever reached them!! Great price and I would order this container again.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased. I needed a large pill box to accommodate supplements my doctor wants me to take, but one that would also stay closed. The lids on these trays snap closed very securely. Cheaper ones would just pop open in luggage. Mine was clear - I did not receive a color if I was supposed to, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
    <li> Largest pill box I&#x27;ve found.. great if you swallow a handful of stuff:)</li>
    <li> I take about 40 food supplement pills a day. Don&#x27;t judge! :) this pill holder holds them all with room to spare. It&#x27;s the best ever. It has a strong locking mechanism too. I may get another to be set for a two week vacation.</li>
    <li> It does the job. What else can be said? All you have to do is to fill it once a week and take the medications on the assigned days.</li>
    <li> love the lock feature and very spacious compartments</li>
    <li> Very roomy compartments for many large supplements.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This pill sorter is huge and works even for someone like me who takes up to 20 supplements, vitamins and herbal pills  twice daily.  It would also work well to sort earrings and other jewelry for traveling as mentioned in another review.</li>
    <li> Big enough space for all my pills and then some. I have about 10 pills (mostly larger sized) that for just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The locking mechanism is a small nuisance and I removed a star for it.</li>
    <li> I just love this pill holder as it is able to accomodate my daily supply of 10 large vitamins with room for at least another 10 to 15 pills! Taking vitamins has never been so easy now that I only have to open 10 bottles once a week instead of daily!</li>
    <li> I have always needed a locking pill reminder because the ones that don&#x27;t lock end up spilling into my luggage. This does the job nicely.</li>
    <li> I use it every day, holds a lot of meds.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I take a number of daily medications.  I noticed my wrist was getting sore from opening and closing all of the containers every day.  This works perfectly!  I like that it locks, and it makes it easy to sort out three months worth of pills at once!</li>
    <li> Wife has hard time taking vitamins this is helping out.</li>
    <li> Be forewarned.  This thing is huge.  You can check the dimensions on the product page, but let me tell you this.  I am a healthy adult man of average size.  I take a large number of supplements and medicines -- so many pills that I have to take them in two or three small handfuls. I have been using the Detach N Go Am/pm Detachable Pill Box JUMBO ([...] and it takes two of those to hold my daily regimen.  All of those pills fit into this unit with plenty of room to spare.  I could probably double the number of pills in each compartment before it would start to feel crowded.  If you need something that large, this is for you.  If not, you might consider something smaller.</li>
    <li> I take some large supplements and this fit the bill. I&#x27;ve always struggled with keeping up on taking not only my few prescriptions but also my supplements which are quite large.  Now that I have them in one place, all is well.  I take them every morning and I never forget.</li>
    <li> Now I can fit all of my supplements into one compartment. Easy to open and close. I really like the unlocking button you press on the left side.</li>
    <li> I already have several of these and I love them. Very large compartments. Easy to open. Easy to close. Great.</li>
    <li> Great !  I bought (and need) 2.  One each for my AM and PM supplement stacks.  Large capacity, sturdy &amp; well made.  The locking mechanism is nice in that it would prevent spilling in case you were to accidentally drop or bump this pill case, without making it difficult or clumsy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall dimensions:  11 1/16&amp;#34; x 2 7/16&amp;#34; x 1 3/16&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Compartment interior dimensions:  1 1/2&amp;#34; x 2 1/8&amp;#34; x 1 1/8&amp;#34; with compartment lid closed</li>
    <li> Very large as described.  Sturdy.</li>
    <li> This pill case is the bomb. I take a lot of nutritional supplements that need 2-4 pills a day so this case is great for that.  Can hold a lot of pills.</li>
    <li> I find these a little difficult to open but they are the largest I have found and once they are properly closed they stay that way. Accidental spills are less likely with this model.</li>
    <li> My Dr. advised against this because it hasn&#x27;t been reviewed by the FDHA.  I take too many medications to chance it so I guess I&#x27;m just out.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Love these containers and use them to get vitamins together for vacations and every day!!! I did take the plastic dowel out though!!! Could not figure a use for it, they work great without!! I have 3 of them!</li>
    <li> way bigger than I thought it would be - ridiculously big..</li>
    <li> As advertised, very large and easy to use for my mother-in-law.</li>
    <li> This is great for me. I take a lot of vitamins everyday so this allows me plenty of space. I also like that it has the locking part so that it doesn&#x27;t accidently open when I am traveling.</li>
    <li> The locking mechanism on the left side is brilliant.  My pills don&#x27;t fall out and I have a zillion in each compartment!  Finally a container bi enough to hold them all!!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Great, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> --Update 01/26/2015--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have been using this pill box without a problem.  The locking mechanism works as well today as when I first bought it several years ago.  Even if you don&#x27;t need one this big, I would recommend finding ones made by this manufacturer with the same lock design.  It just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--original review below--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than two years of daily use I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that the locking mechanism still works.  All of the doors/hatches are working as new.  When I first bought it I expected it to not last because it&#x27;s just plastic, but I&#x27;m glad I was wrong.  Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> This works as advertised and was a nice buy for my wife and I. It is large - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;d fit well over 20 pills/supplements per day.</li>
    <li> careful when purchasing. make sure to physically draw out the measurements onto a piece of paper, because this thing is HUUUUUUUUUUUGE!</li>
    <li> These medication containers lock securely but be sure you understand how the locking pin works to release the lid on each compartment as you need to open them.</li>
    <li> These really are big which is just what I wanted. They snap tight so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them escaping in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> Perfect if you take supplements and other large pills!</li>
    <li> It is way too big.... My dad asked for a big pill reminder but it ended up being way too big. It did say 3XL. So it is what it is.</li>
    <li> Pretty avid weight lifter and health nut, so I have quite a few pills in my life and this guy is able to handle all of them.  Between my supplements and vitamins I&#x27;ll have an average of 12 pills a day and this pill container handles them no problem. I&#x27;ve never had the container open and spill my vitamins and it usually spends its days being trashed around in my backpack.</li>
    <li> I take a lot of vitamins each day and this pill caddy was plently big.  I had been trying to buy one this big locally with no luck.. Very happy</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I needed it to be childproof - even it noted no pill containers are 100% childproof, I find this one to be exeptionally easy to be open.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected..... lol.... (you don&#x27;t hear that much)  I can slam in my B&#x27;s, Multi&#x27;s, and fish oil caps.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Product looks fine but the size is much larger than I thought  and  way to large for all my vitamins.  I might order the next size smaller and use the one I purchased for pistol ammo storage.</li>
    <li> This fits all my supplements - FINALLY.</li>
    <li> I have a boatload of the older version of these... like the new locking feature, keeps accidents from happening if you drop it.</li>
    <li> Like the large size.  I use it for my daily vitamins and it works great.</li>
    <li> I take many vitamins and this pill reminder helps me take what I need daily without forgetting a pill. I refill it one day per week.</li>
    <li> Holds those big pills like fish oil that keep other pill containers from closing. Snap close is nice and firm, but still easy enough to open.</li>
    <li> Not really a locking pill box. The compartments just snap shut. I previously bought a truly locking pill box from apparently another supplier and thought I was getting the box I bought before. This one works but is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is BIG.  Each compartment would hold, I&#x27;m guessing, 30 tablets or more.  I fit 15 in it with enough room for more than twice that much, and I&#x27;m talking big horse pills, not the little tiny kind. Took away one star because it is not as easy to open each compartment as my smaller version, but it isn&#x27;t difficult.</li>
    <li> Lids are hard to open and close.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Holds quite a few pills.</li>
    <li> This advertised at large - and IT IS VERY LARGE. It is an oversized pill organizer for anyone who really needs to house many pills for each day. I will not return it even though it is much larger than I need. My supplements are large capsules and I take 8 large pills daily. This holds much more. If you want a large holder this one is what you should order. The price was very low.</li>
    <li> Finally, a pill organizer that is large enough!  Getting everything into a regular pill organizer never worked well, and this is just the ticket!</li>
    <li> This is not something you want to put in a backpack, purse, etc.  The locking mechanism doesn&#x27;t work well and since the individual latches don&#x27;t stay well, it&#x27;s very easy for all the pills to fall out.  Unless you plan on putting this on a shelf, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> item looks great. fast shipment. thanks.</li>
    <li> I use this for vitamins.....we take A LOT. Anyways, the inner compartments are very roomy and yet the box barely takes up space and the lid locks tight.  Not a really exciting thing to leave a review on......OH, one theses hung tho, these are sold for a dollar at every Dollar Tree that I have ever been to. That little tid bit is the true reason for my review. I love Amazon more than anything, but what a rip off!!</li>
