      <li>Smell really good .</li>
      <li>But you might want to invest your savings from this product in a good clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>This Heat Protect Spray works really good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Matrix Gold Heat Spray for years while straightening my hair, but this Tresemme works just as good,</li>

      <li>. . . but honestly it works.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced and a very good thing to have in the hair arsenal.  </li>
      <li>The design of the spray bottle is good and makes using it easy.  </li>

      <li>Great purchase and the price is right ,</li>
      <li>This spray has a very nice, fresh fragrance.</li>
      <li>The Thermal Creations spray works better.</li>
      <li>This was just okay.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a month now and love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>whats the point of using this product if it gives me more breakage than what i had using no protectant at all.</li>
      <li>I am glad that this is a trigger spray so that I can aim it and use it evenly to spray all over my hair.</li>
      <li>I think this works ok...</li>
      <li>It seems to work ok as a heat protectant but needs re-applying.</li>
      <li>so I figured this must be better.</li>
      <li>so Tresemme is definitely better, all the way around.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like water to me...</li>
      <li>A spray application (like hair spray), would be a lot more user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I mostly use it when trying to get my bangs to lay correctly and this does the trick.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway... I think this worked ok on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I do feel better about using something that is supposed to help reduce damage, but it could be scented water in a spray bottle</li>
      <li>The product is probably ok but the sprayer won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that the Tresemme Platinum Strength Heat Protect Spray doesn&#x27;t help too much to detangle hair, but it does seem to do a very nice job over time against heat damage.  </li>
      <li>every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, while my hair looks conditioned and clean, it is not at all weighted own, greasy, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does the job and it smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>This heat protectant spray is pretty good.</li>
      <li>In addition to it&#x27;s feel, it&#x27;s scent is also light, which is refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Emrvice was very quick everything nicely wrapped there was a little leak but not a problem because the wrap was so neat product smells very good</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and light,and for some reason conducts static incredibly well so in dry conditions (like this winter in Los Angeles)</li>
      <li>A lather, rinse, repeat cycle with a clarifying shampoo easily removed the build</li>
      <li>Love to use Tresemme because its low cost for great salon products.</li>
      <li>I go through heat protectant very quickly with all the blow drying and styling I tend to do.</li>
      <li>The scent is very mild and it seems to help manage the fly-away hairs.  </li>
      <li>The scent is a bit strong for my taste, but otherwise this product works, even on a senior citizen&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>I rely on heat to style my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The one positive is it has a nice, light fragrance--more feminine than unisex, though.</li>
      <li>spray has a light scent.</li>
      <li>While my hair was smooth and manageable, it had diminished shine.</li>
      <li>The result is beautifully smooth, moisturized, healthy-looking hair.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really believe that any product can do that if I can be quite honest.  </li>
      <li>This is great for protecting your hair against a blowdryer as well as a flat iron or even a curling iron.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, flowery, pleasant - tresemme products all kind of have the same scent with minor</li>
      <li>Did my research before buying &amp; was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair, she doesn&#x27;t use any other Tresemme products on her hair, so perhaps it would work better if used with the \\&quot;matching\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Similar, but not as good.</li>
      <li>Every time I try to spray, the whole top pops off.</li>
      <li>It is absorbed into the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy but shiny and smooth and seems to reduce frizz.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is yet another fantastic Tresemme product in the new lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray this on before I blow out my hair, and it gives my hair body, volume, shine and smoothness better than anything else.</li>
      <li>I use a lot of heat on my hair (blow dryer and flat iron) and it&#x27;s good to know that my hair is being protected.</li>
      <li>Okay, so admittedly I am new to the world of flat-ironing (Hello Florida!</li>
      <li>, there is a mild scent, but it is not noticeable after your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Ok I don&#x27;t know what it is about this heat protectant, but it makes my hair super duper duper soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>During the time that I&#x27;ve been using this, I haven&#x27;t been experiencing as many split ends as I normally</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t blow dry my hair often since it is very fine and prone to breaking, but my hair still looks and feels healthy.</li>
      <li>For the first day, my hair is smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I had a Tresemme Heat Protect Spray before that I loved, this is clearly not the right one.</li>
      <li>actually makes my hair even more silky, smells a lot better, and is much cheaper...</li>
      <li>You either might be not using enough on your hair, or your hair needs a nice oil treatment.</li>
      <li>As per the directions, I sprayed on damp, freshly shampooed and conditioned hair and combed through.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The fragrance is not unpleasant but it lasts a long time and that&#x27;s not supposed to be the most noticeable effect from a hair conditioning product!</li>
      <li>it seemed to get it pretty straight and smooth with the iron.</li>
      <li>, it felt very soft and strong.</li>
      <li>I would pay a little more for a better quality product.</li>
      <li>This product is very, very lightweight.  </li>
      <li>and I definitely like this design better</li>
      <li>But blow dryers, irons, and hot rollers all take a toll.</li>
      <li>and everything is so smooth and soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it was a cheaper price than i found it in cvs and works just as well</li>
    <li> Works great and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get used very enough but seems to work.  But dose fill heavy</li>
    <li> I used it a couple of times but it made my bathroom floor dangerously slippery afterwards so I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> This was just okay. It hasn&#x27;t really helped my hair as much as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I like this and will use up the bottle (I think), but it isn&#x27;t as good as the Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray. Similar, but not as good. It&#x27;s hard to quantify, but my hair does not feel quite as soft, doesn&#x27;t hold a curl quite as well, and this doesn&#x27;t help as much with static. My hair is fine and light,and for some reason conducts static incredibly well so in dry conditions (like this winter in Los Angeles) I get terrible fly-aways. The Thermal Creations spray works better. I also prefer the scent, but that&#x27;s truly minor.</li>
    <li> The product is probably ok but the sprayer won&#x27;t work. Every time I try to spray, the whole top pops off. I like the fact that it has an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; switch but the fact that it won&#x27;t spray pretty much defeats the purpose. Not cool!</li>
    <li> I hate having to use this spray anymore because its so easy to make your hair look greasy. The spray bottle design releases a lot of product in a wide arc so its difficult to control how much and where the product goes on your head. I cannot use it on anything other than my ends because one spray makes my roots like greasy. It can also make your ends look greasy if you spray too much. It seems to work ok as a heat protectant but needs re-applying. I don&#x27;t feel like I can use it while my hair is wet, blow dry and then straighten. You have to re-apply post blow drying. I would pay a little more for a better quality product.</li>
    <li> This is great at protecting my hair from the damages of heat styling! I also like the pleasant smell. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY.. Ive bought 2 and the trigger always breaks.</li>
    <li> Really nice quality. Not only protects hair from heating but also make the straightening and curling stay longer. I used it on my curls and even after a day, after I woke up from bed, lot of them were still in shape. I even use it as hair mask live on serum. I totally like it.</li>
    <li> Having used other Tresemme products, I felt safe purchasing this.  I like that the sprayer can be \\&quot;locked\\&quot; into place to prevent spillage in my suitcase when traveling, however, I do not like the results this spray gives. I purchased this to use with my flat-iron. Usually my hair is soft and shiney but after using this, my hair was very dry, felt like straw, and after sleeping on my hair, it was completely frizzed.  Having not changed any of my other hair products I know that this was the culperate.</li>
    <li> bought these for my girls as they use a lot of blowing, hair dryers, curlers etc., so far this is very helpful in protecting their hair</li>
    <li> Decided to purchase this about a month ago, because the store didn&#x27;t have my Thermal Creations Heat Protect Spray. I do not regret it one bit!&lt;br /&gt;After years of coloring my hair, it is hard to find a heat protect that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling more damaged than what it already was. My hair always feels very soft after using this! It also calmed down the frizz, I didn&#x27;t expect that from a heat protect spray! Plus the smell of this is definitely amazing and not strong. I get headaches easily, so this product is a big plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for you as in gets sticky, pull the sprayer farther away. If your hair seems just as damaged as before. You either might be not using enough on your hair, or your hair needs a nice oil treatment. Remember this is a heat protect spray, you can only get so many benefits from it.</li>
    <li> When I bought my Staighener I figured I would buy a new bottle of heat protectant. Bad idea. When I got this in the mail it had almost completely soaked through the package it spilled out so much. Very poor. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Ok I don&#x27;t know what it is about this heat protectant, but it makes my hair super duper duper soft and smooth. Like, anyone would notice it. I have very long straight hair, with probably about medium thickness, so if that sounds similar to you, I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Im not sure if this product even helped with protecting from heat but i would rather pass then be left with what it left me. This product dryed out my hair so bad to the point it feels like hay whats the point of using this product if it gives me more breakage than what i had using no protectant at all. Overall waste of money.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t blow dry my hair often since it is very fine and prone to breaking, but my hair still looks and feels healthy. it does take a bit longer to dry but i think that&#x27;s probably the chemicals.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel dry</li>
    <li> I looooooved the thermal heat spray so I figured this must be better. Nope. I have dry, brittle and thick hair that looks beautiful with the right product. After using this (and yes i made a few attempts with different shampoos) i felt it left my hair rough and dry. Going back to tresemme&#x27;s thermal creations.</li>
    <li> This amazing stuff left my hair feeling silky and soft. Its a good deal because the Price and the quality, so I just love it</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and heat appliances just fry it.  Since I started using this spray, my ends remain moisturized and sleek.  I will never blow dry or hot curl without it.  This product is a must have.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works, I don&#x27;t use dryer more often. However, I see no damage on my hair when I do dry  them using the dryer during winters.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this made my hair feel really crispy. I started with my normal soft hair, lightly sprayed it on, brushed and straightened my hair, and then my hair felt like straw! Hated it. I had a Tresemme Heat Protect Spray before that I loved, this is clearly not the right one.</li>
    <li> Emrvice was very quick everything nicely wrapped there was a little leak but not a problem because the wrap was so neat product smells very good would recommend it thank you</li>
    <li> Smell really good . Is not heavy on your hair and still looks shiny . Great purchase and the price is right ,</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  It really helps condition and protect your hair from heat damage.  After shampooing/conditioning, you towel dry your hair then spray this on and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include a long line of chemical compounds as well as water and castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: water, Glycerin, Dimethiconol, VP/VA Copolymer, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, PEG/PPG-25/25 Dimethicone, Coceth-7, Fragrance (Parfum), PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, DMDM Hydantoin, Laureth-23, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Chloride, Butylene Glycol, C10-40 Isoalkylamidopropylethyldimonium Ethosulfate, and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is 8 ounces for just a little over $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that using this product even every 2nd or 3rd shampooing helps to minimize frizzes and other dryness I often see from blow-drying every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, while my hair looks conditioned and clean, it is not at all weighted own, greasy, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I go through heat protectant very quickly with all the blow drying and styling I tend to do. I had been buying much more expensive \\&quot;designer\\&quot; protectant and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Half the price and same results- shiny, healthy hair.</li>
    <li> . . . but honestly it works.  I has a light pleasant aroma and an easy-to-operate spray component.  I mostly use it when trying to get my bangs to lay correctly and this does the trick.  Same thing for the sides.  It&#x27;s very reasonably priced and a very good thing to have in the hair arsenal.  Certain days of the week you just never know what&#x27;s going to whip your hair into place/shape.  My hair does not get that dry frizzed look when I&#x27;m done so maybe it really does work as a \\&quot;heat protect\\&quot; product.  Either I buy clip-on bangs or I keep this type of product in the house!</li>
    <li> My wife got this to use as she is constantly either blow drying or straightening her hair.  She wanted to help protect her hair from the extra damage that these processes cause.  This product seems to help some with keeping her hair from getting as dry as usual.  It also helps cut down on the friziness as her hair is really curly. She will keep using this product as it seems to help her hair out.  It also doesnt leave your hair feeling greasy or oily after application. A decent product that seems to work so far.</li>
    <li> I have short/medium length, fine, color treated hair, which I use a flat iron on daily.  My daughter has shoulder length coarse hair that she flat irons every other day (with touch ups on her \\&quot;off\\&quot; days)  We have both used this product for about a month, and both of us have had similar opinions on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the trigger is a little awkward to use, but it isn&#x27;t overly difficult to spray your entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is a mild scent, but it is not noticeable after your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8oz bottle has lasted over a month, with daily use by me, and every other day use by my daughter.  A little goes a long way with this product, which makes it more economical than other sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, I did notice a build-up on my hair.  I also learned after the first day to keep the product away from my roots, as it made them look limp and greasy.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is considerable coarser than mine, and it was almost two weeks before any build up was noticeable on her hair.  A lather, rinse, repeat cycle with a clarifying shampoo easily removed the build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that the product repaired any damage already done to our hair, but it did keep things from getting worse.  I have used other heat protecting sprays in the past, and I would say that this product is about average. The fact that the bottle lasts a long time makes it an economical choice, and I plan to continue to purchase this item in the future.</li>
    <li> Tresemm&amp;eacute; Platinum Strength Heat Protect Spray is a spray-on conditioner marketed for heat-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray handle is awkward but produces an even mist.  It is absorbed into the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy but shiny and smooth and seems to reduce frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not unpleasant but it lasts a long time and that&#x27;s not supposed to be the most noticeable effect from a hair conditioning product!</li>
    <li> This spray has a very nice, fresh fragrance. It smells like spring. You just spray it on to your hair after you shampoo and condition your hair. You apply it while your hair is still wet. Then just dry your hair as usual. This spray is not sticky. It did not really change how my hair felt afterwards. It did not dry my hair out. I use a lot of heat on my hair (blow dryer and flat iron) and it&#x27;s good to know that my hair is being protected.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my teenage daughter who was worried about drying out her hair since she blow dries it every night and uses heat styling products almost every day. Her hair is slightly wavy, fine, but very thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thought the product was a little greasy and found that her hair was more difficult to style after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, she doesn&#x27;t use any other Tresemme products on her hair, so perhaps it would work better if used with the \\&quot;matching\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner. In any case, it didn&#x27;t work for my daughter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more like water to me...didn&#x27;t do much for my hair...</li>
    <li> My hair is my pride and joy, so I demand a lot from hair care products.  I&#x27;m always trying new ones, but unfortunately most are disappointing.  Tresemme Platinum Strength Heat Protect spray belongs in the reject pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put it simply, this is a cheap spray that left my hair dull and tacky, even though I did not use too much.  The odd thing was, after blow drying my hair, I attempted to straighten a few bendy pieces with a flat iron, and the spray prevented me from getting a smooth result.  Usually one pass of the iron gives me sleek, shiny hair.  I would not use this spray again and I don&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one positive is it has a nice, light fragrance--more feminine than unisex, though.</li>
    <li> I received this trial product through the Vine Program as was curious if it would make a difference to my hair using curling Iron, blow dying my hair and playing golf in the summer sun. I have not noticed too much difference as at my age of 87 I still have lots of hair and wanted to protect it in some way.  I found using the spray nozzle was uncomfortable to use I seemed to be spraying into the air some of the time.  My thumb would slip off and would try it with one finger.  I could give my hair the mist but used too much the first time.  My hair sort of clumpped together if that is a word.  It looked like it needed another washing so used a smaller amount after that.  It is not something I though made too much of a difference and so eased up on using the curling iron and only partially blow dry my hair.  That seemed to be the answer so am hoping it will work this summer when playing golf in the sun.  That is when I need the protection so give this product a try and use it in ways that helps preserve your hair for a long tme.</li>
    <li> My bangs are prone to breaking, so I thought this Tresemme product might be the thing to  protect them from curling brush heat. So far, after almost 1 month of use, I think Tresemme Platinum does protect my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme is easy to use - spray it into your hair (it goes on wet) &amp; comb Tresemme through, then dry &amp; style as usual.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent, and even helps make my growing out bangs a little more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is the trigger mechanism on the bottle.  It looks cool, but is a bad design.  In order the spray my bangs, I have to hold the bottle &amp; pump with my thumb &amp; to get the rest of my hair, I have to awkwardly move the bottle around my head &amp; pump the trigger.  A spray application (like hair spray), would be a lot more user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you can get the product evenly onto your hair, you should like its results.</li>
    <li> I have long hair to the middle of my back that has been color treated for many years.  My hair has just enough natural waves to make my thick hair get very &#x27;big&#x27; if I don&#x27;t condition and straighten this.  I have tried numerous heat protecting products , and straightening aids, and I am not a fan of this Tresemme spray.  I think it actually stopped me from getting the straight look I normally have.  I also felt my looked dull and lacked movement.  Sorry to say this is not for me, because I usually like their other products.</li>
    <li> This Heat Protect Spray works really good. It makes your hair so soft and smooth when using it with a straightening iron. My hair feels so silky and healthy, all the way down to the very ends. It&#x27;s like it makes the split ends no longer visible - like they seal up. A lot of times when I straighten my hair, the ends look and feel a little rough, but when I use this spray my hair turns out so nice and everything is so smooth and soft. It also makes your hair smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Matrix Gold Heat Spray for years while straightening my hair, but this Tresemme works just as good, actually makes my hair even more silky, smells a lot better, and is much cheaper...so Tresemme is definitely better, all the way around. The Matrix Spray does add a little shine, which the Tresemme doesn&#x27;t, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I can do without the shine for all the other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just spray a little on each section as I straighten my hair and it turns out perfect. After several uses it does start to show a little product buildup on the flat ion, but this happens with virtually any product you use with a flat iron and it wipes right off with a damp rag or a cleaning wipe like Clorox or Lysol wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a GREAT heat protectant spray at a great price.</li>
    <li> I use it every time I straighten my hair. I&#x27;ve straightened my hair before without it, but this definitely helps out with it not being as frizzy.</li>
    <li> I finally understand what other people said about this product, they are mostly true btw. It feels a lot similar to my other &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; functioning hair spray, guess thats what &amp;#34;strength&amp;#34; means. I really hope it gives extra heat protection, since thats the only reason i&#x27;ll endure those heavy residuals. but i&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> This heat protectant spray is pretty good. It does the job and it smells pretty good. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair really greasy or dry. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it was amazing ,but it was good. I will probably buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. But I rather the nexxus brand because I was trying to avoid any products without sulfate.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements in tanning down the freeze. Hope still protects my hair from the hair dryer though</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of hair products in general. Partly because most of them are too heavily perfumed and partly because of expense. The other factor is that I&#x27;m a low maintenance person when it comes to hair. I want it to look nice and I pay every 6 weeks or so for professional color and highlighting. But for most of my adult life, I wear my hair washed and dried and that&#x27;s about it. Curling, styling and spraying it into a helmet shape is just too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I have recently grown bored with my always-the-same hair and decided to venture into some low-key products. I live in a humid climate which is fabulous for naturally wavy hair that I usually blow dry mostly strait. Read: frizz galore. To \\&quot;cure\\&quot; the problem, I&#x27;ve tried an obscene number of different hair conditioners promising to solve my problem. When most fell short of controlling my frizz, I turned to smoothers, gels and mousses to try and contain my wild strands. I had all but given up and decided to just let it be wild and stop taming it entirely. Until I tried this heat spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed, conditioned and towel dried as I always do. Same hair products I use every day. But Before I blow dried my hair, I sprayed a light mist of the Platinum Strength spray over the surface of my hair then proceeded to dry as I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;Much to my amazement, it actually did the trick. Unlike mousse, my hair wasn&#x27;t sticky. Unlike gel, it wasn&#x27;t heavy. Unlike \\&quot;holding\\&quot; spray, it wasn&#x27;t stiff. And unlike cream conditioners or smoothing serums, it didn&#x27;t make my hair flat. It was actually perfect. My color-treated, mid-length hair had hold, lift, bounce, and NO frizzies. The only other thing I noticed is that it takes a slight edge off of my natural shine, but not a great deal of it. The final \\&quot;pro\\&quot; is that it is NOT heavily perfumed at all. I don&#x27;t feel like I have a cloud of cheap perfume wafting through the air behind me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> I am not very happy with this product. While the spray is easy to use and has a pleasant scent, it leaves my hair with that sticky, stiff feeling like I&#x27;m wearing hair spray and worst of all, my hair seems really dry after using it. I have used other heat protection sprays that have worked for me, but would not purchase this one again--sorry.</li>
    <li> I am always worried because I am using heat to straighten my hair that I am going to damage it.  So, what I did was order the Tresemme Platnium Strength Heat Protect Spray. This was a great idea, it is proven to help keep hair healthy and looking great and it was something that I definitely needed with my heat damage.</li>
    <li> This product is very, very lightweight.  In addition to it&#x27;s feel, it&#x27;s scent is also light, which is refreshing.  I&#x27;ve found that the Tresemme Platinum Strength Heat Protect Spray doesn&#x27;t help too much to detangle hair, but it does seem to do a very nice job over time against heat damage.  During the time that I&#x27;ve been using this, I haven&#x27;t been experiencing as many split ends as I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found that this product does do as it claims; however, there are other products that I feel do a better job.  [[ASIN:B002CMLHEC It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product, 10-Ounce Bottle]] seems to do a much better job overall of not only protecting against heat, but also in detangling and smoothing hair.  Tresemme holds the blue ribbon on scent, though, as It&#x27;s a 10 has a rather chemical, rubbery scent to it.</li>
    <li> Feels like no product is in hair. Great.</li>
    <li> Great!! I was concerned that when I first applied to my hair it felt thick, but then the next day I applied it at night after my shower , when I woke up in the morning and straightened my hair, it felt very soft and strong. Normally my hair tends to frizz , but with this product it doesn&#x27;t !</li>
    <li> The scent is a bit strong for my taste, but otherwise this product works, even on a senior citizen&#x27;s hair.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> When it comes to heat protection I don&#x27;t believe this is a product you should skimp on - go to Ulta and grab something that&#x27;s a little more expensive but is actually going to do the job. I noticed no change to my hair after using this product - I just use a flat iron on my bangs to sweep them to the side and this left them looking frizzy and by the next day the style was totally gone. Tossed it out and stuck with my Biosilk.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it. And it takes a long time to blow dry. I got this hoping it would keep my hair from drying out too much. Instead, it leaves a sticky, film on my hair. I&#x27;d rather use a deep conditioner and then blow dry so my hair still feels clean after a wash. This may protect your hair after extended blow drying and curling irons. But I probably won&#x27;t be using often enough to see a difference.</li>
    <li> This definitely coats your hair with a protectant spray. The only real problem is it does leave a bit of build up on your hair but that is to be expected from this type of product. I used this with a flat iron after I blow dried my hair. My hair didn&#x27;t feel sticky or anything like that but I did notice it had a coating on it and some residue was left on my flat iron after a couple weeks of use. It does help but doesn&#x27;t completely prevent split ends and hair breakage. Good for those who use a flat iron moderately but for heavy users I would stick with Chi heat protectant spray, it worked much better with heavy use.</li>
    <li> Okay, so admittedly I am new to the world of flat-ironing (Hello Florida! I look like a poodle!) with that, I decided I should probably try to protect my hair as much as I could from the abuse of blow drying and flat ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the body is a great design - the trigger is really easy to use and I definitely like this design better then your average pump spray.  The smell is nice, flowery, pleasant - tresemme products all kind of have the same scent with minor differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for protecting my hair, I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference but I&#x27;m also not really sure what I&#x27;m looking for. I do feel better about using something that is supposed to help reduce damage, but it could be scented water in a spray bottle and I think I&#x27;d be just as impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use it because I&#x27;m assuming it is doing something, I just don&#x27;t think its an obvious difference.</li>
    <li> I have tried several new Tresemme products lately and all have been exceptional. I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve been up to lately but I remember back when they first started a long time ago, I swore I&#x27;d never buy this brand again. They&#x27;ve done a complete 180 degree turn around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is yet another fantastic Tresemme product in the new lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray this on before I blow out my hair, and it gives my hair body, volume, shine and smoothness better than anything else. I like the trigger pump spray bottle, the large size and low price, and most of all, the way my hair looks when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are times when I flat iron my hair, and I get nervous when I see the smoke coming off my hair, although my stylist assures me it is steam. I would never do that without something like this to add protection. This makes my hair soft smooth and silky, and the straight style resists humidity and frizz after ironing. If you iron your hair and want to give it protection from heat, look no further than this. It is excellent.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great with out being overwhelming.  The design of the spray bottle is good and makes using it easy.  This helped protect my long hair from the heat of flat ironing.</li>
    <li> Does just what it claims</li>
    <li> The positives are that this product does deliver on what it advertises. The bad news is that it also gives side-effects that are not as desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, \\&quot;TRESemm&amp;eacute; Platinum Strength Heat Protect Spray protects hair from the damaging effects of heat styling including breakage, frizz and dryness. The result is beautifully smooth, moisturized, healthy-looking hair.\\&quot; For the first day, my hair is smooth and moisturized. So that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is also weighed down and feels greasy. I have thick, wavy hair that I wash and blow dry weekly/biweekly and then use a straight iron daily to maintain. With this product it feels gross and greasy the first day, but looks smooth. By the second day, I have to wash it because it looks (and feels) limp and disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an everyday washer then this product will work great for you. If not, I recommend you try a different product.</li>
    <li> Works great with blow drying or flat ironing to smooth and hold out frizzing all day long without further frying your hair. I especially love the spray for easy application, no greasy fingers! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I think this works ok... but Im not sure if it&#x27;s really protecting my hair.  I don&#x27;t really believe that any product can do that if I can be quite honest.  I think this product HELPS make my hair smoother when using an iron.  Maybe there is some sort of barrier put down but I just have a hard time believing that there is no damage sustained to my hair from the heat of the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... I think this worked ok on my hair.  it seemed to get it pretty straight and smooth with the iron.</li>
    <li> Did my research before buying &amp; was not disappointed. This is a very good product at a bargain price!</li>
    <li> I rely on heat to style my fine hair. But blow dryers, irons, and hot rollers all take a toll. It comes fdown to a choice, flat, limp hair or styled but damaged. This product promises to protect while fortifying and moisturizing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray has a light scent. As per the directions, I sprayed on damp, freshly shampooed and conditioned hair and combed through. While my hair was smooth and manageable, it had diminished shine. It also had a slightly stiff, coated feel. The next use, I used far less. The results were the same, minimum shine, coarse feel but otherwise smooth and manageable. The spray does seem to provide a barrier from the heat but the cost is loss of shine and touchability. It did seem to build up, even when using a minimal amount, and I had to use a clarifying shampoo to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use alot of heat regularly, you might want to invest in this product. It is a cost effective version and it does seem to protect. But you might want to invest your savings from this product in a good clarifying shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is great for protecting your hair against a blowdryer as well as a flat iron or even a curling iron. This has a light scent and gives great results for your hair not to get damaged. I am glad that this is a trigger spray so that I can aim it and use it evenly to spray all over my hair. Love to use Tresemme because its low cost for great salon products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and love it.  My hair never feels dried out after blow-drying.  It also smells so good that I&#x27;d buy it for that reason alone!</li>
    <li> Okay, I have extremely thick, curly hair. I was tired of my hair looking like it was burnt and frazzled. Have used a ton of different products, but ever since Thermasilk disappeared off the market, the heat protection on my hair has been gone. I figured I would give this a shot especially since I have been avid about not having something. This done great. Downfall is that I do have to wait about 30-45 minutes for my hair to get &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; enough that the product will stay in it. But since it works, I can live with the sacrifice</li>
    <li> This is the first heat protection product that I have put on while my hair is wet. Most you spray on dry hair right before using roller or a straightener.  I have to say, I am impressed.  This doesn&#x27;t give my hair the stiff feeling the other protection sprays do but I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage.  The scent is very mild and it seems to help manage the fly-away hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t take much even for my long hair so I expect this to last 6 to 9 months easily.</li>
