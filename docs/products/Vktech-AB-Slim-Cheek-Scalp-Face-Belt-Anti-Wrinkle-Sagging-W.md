### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>GREAT IDEA !!!!</li>
      <li>See results in a week, I use with slimming cream for best results, cleopatra slimming cream is best</li>
      <li>The idea here is superb but the material used leaves a lot to be desired.  </li>
      <li>The slit that goes under the chip slips out of place, the opening for the ears is perfect though.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m seeing some great results.</li>
      <li>and I am happy with the way that my chin fat has begun to disappear so soon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M BEING CHOKED LOL, LIKE</li>
      <li>BUT I WAS IN NO HURRY TO GET IT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT PRICE.</li>
      <li>Great to wear after using derma roller &amp;  good ingredients</li>
      <li>good item</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>It is really good construction.</li>
      <li>This was a very satisfying product.</li>
      <li>quality is nice also, good seller</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like wearing a corset around your head (or a good-fitting effective body shaper lingerie).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy :) I really do recommend this to others.</li>
      <li>But this one is very comfortable</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S VERY COMFORTABLE.</li>
      <li>I SEE IN MOST OF THE REVIEWS.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say keep looking for a better product.</li>
      <li>Once I figured how to put it on, it was okay.</li>
      <li>Will continue shopping for a better made one.</li>
      <li>GLAD</li>
      <li>ok quality..does not work for the purpose..</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>will update this review in a month or so and give better feedback as to the effectiveness and comfort of the product.</li>
      <li>And to top it off, I accidentally bought 2.</li>
      <li>got another one that is really good right after I ordered this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But the first night I used it I liked it.  </li>
      <li>Fits fine</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery! :)</li>
      <li>Comfortable, nice, I like it so much,</li>
      <li>Really nice soft &amp; comfortable material.</li>
      <li>The device is nice and snug, especially under the chin where I need it most.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty cool and works!</li>
      <li>I bought this mask on a whim, looking for more natural ways to tone my face -- under chin, lift cheeks etc.  </li>
      <li>the results are definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>nothing I did felt right.</li>
      <li>However, after returning back to this picture I was able to figure it out quickly.</li>
      <li>I felt my skin in my face tighten after the first use.</li>
      <li>On me, it sits closer to the back of my head about 5&amp;#34; from the top of my forehead.</li>
      <li>At this point I&#x27;m willing to do the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The issue I&#x27;m personally having with this is that when I pull the top forward, it also pulls the bottom towards my neck.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t work and broke first time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all to me.</li>
      <li>fast delivery,material is soft and easy to wear</li>
      <li>I need a large or xl.  </li>
      <li>For medium size you definetely need to order large.</li>
      <li>I HAVE THE MEDIUM TO LARGE SIZE.</li>
      <li>If you try a face mask just realize it&#x27;s not supposed to feel &#x27;good&#x27; but it shouldn&#x27;t make it hard to breathe or cause neck/jaw pain either.  </li>
      <li>AND I REALLY</li>
      <li>Very limiting.  </li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>but i really doesn&#x27;t at all</li>
      <li>VERY</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay very well on a head; again right size is essential, if you could choose right one.</li>
      <li>It is certainly not suffocating since it comes nowhere near your nose or mouth.</li>
      <li>As you can see from the picture, it sits further back an inch or 2 from the top of your forehead.</li>
      <li>The material feels like polyester with lycra, two materials I don&#x27;t particularly want close to my face or to sleep in.  </li>
      <li>It is tight, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to my skin/hair and the top slips off.</li>
      <li>It is very tight fitting.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no miracle worker, but with regular use the change is evident.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same exact principle as all the body shaper (spanx girdles etc) but for your face.  </li>
      <li>I try to remedy this by wearing a pony tail high up to keep it from sliding too far back and trying not to move my head around as much.</li>
      <li>very long shipping, comes with no instructions , all the good reviews had to have been fake because honestly when you take it out it looks like a sports bra , waste of money</li>
      <li>I WORE IT THE WHOLE DAY AROUND THE HOUSE AND WORE IT WHILE WATCHING MY KIDS PLAY OUTSIDE.</li>
      <li>It suffocates you and didn&#x27;t make any diffrence to my face as far asni am concerned.</li>
      <li>Before I put it on at night I use Slim Green Reduce Cream (available on Amazon) on the problem areas.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this as much as needed and it definitely gave an uplift to my face.</li>
      <li>Overall the shipping was considerately fast</li>
      <li>Other than that, I&#x27;d say it was well worth</li>
      <li>It only took 6 days to arrive and I instantly saw results through the first use of this.</li>
      <li>(I have it on right now as I &#x27;m looking down to type).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product while I&#x27;m on my laptop, since I notice my head position makes the chin skin double up for hours (no good!), but so far, I haven&#x27;t been able to keep it on while sleeping.</li>
      <li>Another reviewer suggested wearing it for a short periods of time in the beginning and in time it will apparently stretch out a bit, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping for.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a little bit bigger for my face , fast shipping, and</li>
      <li>I would suggest starting with a few minutes and then using it a little longer each night until you can comfortably keep it on all night -</li>

<li> the fit was just awfully weird</li>
<li> Ridiculously long.  </li>
<li> Works long as you stick to it</li>
<li> It took a very long time to arrive.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; thin woman with (IMO) a small head (exactly 22&amp;#34; circumference and 22.25&amp;#34; around my face) and this is very tight, but not completely uncomfortable.</li>

<li> Mine has only 1 inch of material there, so I might just have one that is too small or</li>
<li> Still not sure what this actually does.</li>
<li> Too tight no real instructions included.</li>
<li> and I hardly have a double chin.</li>
<li> I was scared to lay down with it on because i thought I might fall asleep and choke to death</li>
<li> The color in this material does fade when I washed it and the water became black.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work and was too tight around my chin</li>
<li> It&#x27;s tight, so that makes it press quite a bit against my throat.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s tight - as I expect it should be.</li>
<li> As I&#x27;m aging, the skin is beginning to sag a little in that area.</li>
<li> and I have to say it&#x27;s going to take a little time for me to get used to.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> no instructions!!!  Finally gave up and tossed it!!</li>
    <li> I just bought this for 3 weeks now and i see no change at all it is bad use i waisted 5 dollars on this :/</li>
    <li> No good !!!!! I give a way !!!</li>
    <li> It suffocates and it&#x27;s fake. The color in this material does fade when I washed it and the water became black. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this!</li>
    <li> This is product is Functional.</li>
    <li> This was a very satisfying product. It only took 6 days to arrive and I instantly saw results through the first use of this. I will continue to use this as much as needed and it definitely gave an uplift to my face. My face looks really thin now  I&#x27;m very happy :) I really do recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I hate this thing, it took two weeks to come to my house. They ended up sewing the snaps on the WRONG side of the fabric. It was inside out and backwards, came with NO instructions, I asked fora  refund and only got $7 back! I paid $14 includding shipping which took two weeks. Very frustrating and NOT worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Once I figured how to put it on, it was okay. I see the difference. It&#x27;s no miracle worker, but with regular use the change is evident.</li>
    <li> the blod stock in the face.</li>
    <li> I did not like this mask , is not easy to put in on . The material is rough for the skin . I bought it like fours months ago and I am still not used not even one time .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work and was too tight around my chin It was choking g me I was scared to lay down with it on because i thought I might fall asleep and choke to death</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a week ago and I have to say it&#x27;s going to take a little time for me to get used to. I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; thin woman with (IMO) a small head (exactly 22&amp;#34; circumference and 22.25&amp;#34; around my face) and this is very tight, but not completely uncomfortable. Another reviewer suggested wearing it for a short periods of time in the beginning and in time it will apparently stretch out a bit, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping for. The problem at this point is getting it to stay on my head without it choking me. As you can see from the picture, it sits further back an inch or 2 from the top of your forehead. On me, it sits closer to the back of my head about 5&amp;#34; from the top of my forehead.The issue I&#x27;m personally having with this is that when I pull the top forward, it also pulls the bottom towards my neck. It&#x27;s tight, so that makes it press quite a bit against my throat. I try to remedy this by wearing a pony tail high up to keep it from sliding too far back and trying not to move my head around as much. For those who may be wondering, I put it on the way it says to (you will know if you have it wrong). The woman in the picture appears to be wearing a larger one since it looks as though the bottom part extends from the neck to the chin or she has a child size face. Mine has only 1 inch of material there, so I might just have one that is too small or like I said above, take others advice and practice my patients with it to allow it to stretch out a little. At this point I&#x27;m willing to do the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a double chin and I&#x27;ve always been thin. As I&#x27;m aging, the skin is beginning to sag a little in that area. I&#x27;ve been using this product while I&#x27;m on my laptop, since I notice my head position makes the chin skin double up for hours (no good!), but so far, I haven&#x27;t been able to keep it on while sleeping. The reason I give this 4 stars is because this product does prevent chin from doubling 100% (I have it on right now as I &#x27;m looking down to type).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in a month or so and give better feedback as to the effectiveness and comfort of the product. But for now, I just wanted folks to know that this size (I have not seen any other options in sizes) is extremely small.</li>
    <li> it falls off the face and it wont stay on at all........it should stay on but i really doesn&#x27;t at all</li>
    <li> ok quality..does not work for the purpose..</li>
    <li> Way too complicated. Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions either.</li>
    <li> Too tight no real instructions included. Item not as described. The packaging did not include a description or diagram of how to put under neck. The shipping was extremely slow.</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s well made but bad design.  The piece that rest over the chin it&#x27;s to small. Will definitely not recommend it!</li>
    <li> not what expected but good item</li>
    <li> Crsp don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
    <li> It suffocates you and didn&#x27;t make any diffrence to my face as far asni am concerned. Dont&#x27;t waste your money buying this.</li>
    <li> It took a very long time to arrive.  Ridiculously long.  It came with no instructions whatsoever.  I had to come back here to see how it went on.  It is very tight fitting.  You couldn&#x27;t sleep in it.  So the only time I can wear it without looking silly is when I&#x27;m home by myself.  Very limiting.  I&#x27;d say keep looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> It is really good construction. I purchased before more expensive belt from other company and could&#x60;t use it. But this one is very comfortable and I believe it will work.</li>
    <li> This product fits too big in my face and I have a big face. It took almost a moth to receive this product and I was disappointed</li>
    <li> Good product. See results in a week, I use with slimming cream for best results, cleopatra slimming cream is best</li>
    <li> Im in my thirties and have a double chin and wearing this to bed every night definitely reduced my double chin in a week and now over a month and I hardly have a double chin.</li>
    <li> The idea here is superb but the material used leaves a lot to be desired.  The material feels like polyester with lycra, two materials I don&#x27;t particularly want close to my face or to sleep in.  The slit that goes under the chip slips out of place, the opening for the ears is perfect though.  Overall the shipping was considerately fast but I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase because of the materials used.  Will continue shopping for a better made one.</li>
    <li> ive had mine kinda still trying to get used to it still</li>
    <li> Still not sure what this actually does.</li>
    <li> I JUST RECEIVED THIS YESTERDAY AND I REALLY LIKE IT&#x27;S VERY COMFORTABLE. I HAVE THE MEDIUM TO LARGE SIZE. IT HAS 3 SNAPS ON THE SIDE TO ADJUST THE TIGHTNESS. GREAT IDEA !!!! I WORE IT THE WHOLE DAY AROUND THE HOUSE AND WORE IT WHILE WATCHING MY KIDS PLAY OUTSIDE. WITH NO ISSUE&#x27;S OF FEELING LIKE I&#x27;M BEING CHOKED LOL, LIKE I SEE IN MOST OF THE REVIEWS. I TOOK A CHANCE AND WENT AHEAD AN ORDERED IT VERY GLAD I DID. IT DID TAKE QUITE AWHILE TO ARRIVE BUT I WAS IN NO HURRY TO GET IT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> No instructions on how to use it. Not even a picture on how it is to be placed on your face.waste of money</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS AFTER BUYING THE FACIAL COMPRESSION CHIN STRAP, AND WAS WORST THAN THE OTHER. THIS IS NOT GOOD, VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT IT.  WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> Very difficult to wear</li>
    <li> After wearing this a few times you can see a difference, but the strap at the bottom could be a little thicker so it doesn&#x27;t feel like your being chocked at times, over all it&#x27;s pretty cool and works!</li>
    <li> Terrible. Horrid. Wtf. And to top it off, I accidentally bought 2. Ugh. Its in the trash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this at night and I&#x27;m seeing some great results. My problem areas are under the chin and along the jawline, and my face is noticeably slimmer in those areas after a couple of weeks of use. Before I put it on at night I use Slim Green Reduce Cream (available on Amazon) on the problem areas. The device is nice and snug, especially under the chin where I need it most. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all to me. It is certainly not suffocating since it comes nowhere near your nose or mouth. I would suggest starting with a few minutes and then using it a little longer each night until you can comfortably keep it on all night - the results are definitely worth it. It seems to be sturdily made but I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one to keep on hand because I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> There are no directions on how to put this thing on your face. I&#x27;ve fiddled with it for about 30 minutes, nothing I did felt right. Wound up in the trash, don&#x27;t waste your time buying this.</li>
    <li> no instructions, can&#x27;t figure out what to do with this crazy thing</li>
    <li> It is nothing to brag about. Will never purchase again. Is all misleading</li>
    <li> Fits fine but I don&#x27;t see it made a difference with my face. Besides the little breakouts on my chin and cheeks.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery! :) definitely works after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Item received earlier than the scheduled date of delivery.  Love this product. I am using it everynight.</li>
    <li> not very comfy plus came with no instructions</li>
    <li> I bought this mask on a whim, looking for more natural ways to tone my face -- under chin, lift cheeks etc.  I really like it but it&#x27;s too small.  I didn&#x27;t realize I had a size option (mine is M).  I need a large or xl.  But the first night I used it I liked it.  It&#x27;s tight - as I expect it should be. It&#x27;s like wearing a corset around your head (or a good-fitting effective body shaper lingerie).  Even tho it was too small I managed to keep in on and sleep in it - though a not a comfortable thing - but no pain no gain in the beauty arena.  I could feel muscles under my chin being put to work simply by the counterpresser of the band. Next morning Viola!  -- tightened under chin!!  I&#x27;m going to buy the next size up. I&#x27;m a fan!  If you try a face mask just realize it&#x27;s not supposed to feel &#x27;good&#x27; but it shouldn&#x27;t make it hard to breathe or cause neck/jaw pain either.  It&#x27;s the same exact principle as all the body shaper (spanx girdles etc) but for your face.  Just sayin - I likey!</li>
    <li> very long shipping, comes with no instructions , all the good reviews had to have been fake because honestly when you take it out it looks like a sports bra , waste of money</li>
    <li> I should have known it when it was so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I got another one that is really good right after I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;It tooks about 2-3 weeks to arrive. By then, I was using the other product but it was too late to return or cancel the order. I have the product the way it arrived.</li>
    <li> It was to big in size , and I didn&#x27;t have a option to chose the size but it&#x27;s a sturdy material</li>
    <li> It took forever to get here and when it did it didn&#x27;t come with institutions it was very difficult to figure out how to use it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about you but didn&#x27;t work for me the fit was just awfully weird</li>
    <li> Works long as you stick to it</li>
    <li> Really nice soft &amp; comfortable material. Great to wear after using derma roller &amp;  good ingredients (HA. Collegen, etc..) on your skin ! Fits well with a bit of adjustment.</li>
    <li> Still adjusting to the use of this.</li>
    <li> so sad of had bought this.</li>
    <li> More complicated to use than I hoped for. Doesn&#x27;t stay very well on a head; again right size is essential, if you could choose right one. For medium size you definetely need to order large. Mine didn&#x27;t work for me, too small; had to throw away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I felt so &amp;#34;inspired&amp;#34; to write a review. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of you-know-what. Feeling depressed about chubby cheeks? Trust me, you&#x27;ll feel worse after using this: You&#x27;ll be sorer, poorer, and STILL have chubby cheeks.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work and broke first time</li>
    <li> When I received this product I was apalled by no instructions. However, after returning back to this picture I was able to figure it out quickly. I felt my skin in my face tighten after the first use. I recommend washing your face before and after wearing this product if you are prone to acne. Other than that, I&#x27;d say it was well worth the 5$ and I am happy with the way that my chin fat has begun to disappear so soon. Just FYI, it isnt supposed to remove facial fat, just tone the underlying muscles.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, nice, I like it so much, just I thing it&#x27;s a little bit bigger for my face , fast shipping, and quality is nice also, good seller</li>
    <li> fast delivery,material is soft and easy to wear</li>
    <li> Does not fit properly.  It is tight, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to my skin/hair and the top slips off.</li>
</ol>
