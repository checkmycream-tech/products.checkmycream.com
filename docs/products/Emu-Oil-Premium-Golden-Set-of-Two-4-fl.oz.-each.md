<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item exceeded our expectations.  Daughter had surgery and her doc recommended it to aid in the healing process.  Can&#x27;t say enough this product.  Would definitely order again!!!</li>
    <li> I first bought this item while visiting catalina island i was told by the clerk that it works wonders...so i tried it and placed another order for another two bottles ...it works well !!!</li>
    <li> My wife is so happy with the results of her skin since using this product. Will use for many years to come!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive scalp which itches like crazy. Hair came out in clumps with patches all over my head. I use emu oil as part of my hair care routine and I am very satisfied with the results. I have to be careful what products I use because of severe allergies. Koru Emu oil works for me. My granddaughter started using it on her transitioning hair (after breakage and excess shedding, from using a relaxer) and is loving the results. I have 4C hair, hers is 3B  we both are satisfied with this product. I used this product for over two years. I have tried other emu oil products which work fine but Koru for me is the best. Just a little goes very far with great results. Worth every penny. No one paid me to say this this is a really good product. It works for me.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years morning and night. Just love the way it makes my skin feel,</li>
    <li> I got this Emu Oil before. I remember really liking it so decided to order some more. I have very dry hair and dry skin. It works really good for moisturizing my hair and skin. Why I like using it for my skin is it leaves my skin super soft and not oily. I have a wide variety of skin moisturizers because I like I mix it up. For the oil I use baby oil and emu oil. They&#x27;re both nice but the emu oil is definitely better and I use a ton of different hair moisturizers for my hair and my permed hair always looks dead! this by far works best for my hair to keep it looking lively!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for dry skin but so is chicken fat and that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like, smells like and might just be.  certainly no pain relief.</li>
    <li> Wow - this is the best ever.  I use it all over my skin.  For aging it helps keeps the skin moist and soft. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who has fibromyalgia and a pinched nerve. she takes A LOT of meds to help get cope with pain and has been taking them for many years. I had read about the benefits of using emu oil for pain so I bought this with very high hopes. and while I can say that it does seem to work my only complaint is that the effects don&#x27;t last very long. it does work great for fine lines though and has no smell which is a plus. Im not sure if I would buy it again or not but it definitely isn&#x27;t bad and one bottle will last a great while because a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I use this all the time - it&#x27;s a really great product.  I use it on my skin and on my hair.  I also make lotions using this as a component.  It holds up well over time and has a pleasant, kind of Earthy odor.  The scent blends really nicely with vanilla and sandalwood.</li>
    <li> This oil was recommended by a relative so I bought it to help heal two recent surgical incisions.  So far I love it, it goes on easily &amp; does not feel greasy unless you use too much.  The scent is very minimal &amp; it also really softens the skin.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as advertised</li>
    <li> I would call this a &amp;#34;good investment&amp;#34; but...the price is so reasonable &amp;#34;investment&amp;#34; seems a bit silly.  So here&#x27;s the breakdown: the product is great.  I was worried it would be greasy or thick and oily.  But it isn&#x27;t anything like that.  Yes, this is an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; but it is light and absorbs quickly.  It is completely odorless, which is nice.  I have incredibly sensitive skin (which is just sad) and I have tried just about every expensive product out there.  I&#x27;m not going to claim that this works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried on my face but it might.  At the very least, it works just as well as any other product out there.  And it is multi-use.  I add it to my body lotion, use it as a scalp treatment twice a week, and would not put anything else on the skin under my eyes (on those tiny lines, I would claim is work miracles).  And because it is relatively inexpensive, I don&#x27;t feel wasteful for using it liberally and often.</li>
    <li> I have normal, shiny hair, but my scalp was flaking (not sure whether it was because of winter weather, bad nutrition, or something else).  I tried dandruff shampoos, but they made everything worse.  I did not have dandruff, I had dry scalp (they both flake though, so it was hard to tell).  I then tried dry hair/scalp shampoo and conditioner, and that made my hair really greasy without helping my scalp.  Anyways, I bought this Emu Oil, and it worked wonders. It has only been three weeks. All I do is to rub it into my scalp once a week, walk around the house with a plastic bag on my head for about 30 min to keep the oil moist and warm, wash with my regular Biolage shampoo, and my problem is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also added 1/5 of the bottle to a huge tub of lotion and it works wonderfully.  Good quality product.  I would def recommend to others battling dry skin or dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Liked it so well I bought ofne for a gift.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who was told that emu oil helps with thinning hair. He has been using it for over a month now and we can both definitely see a difference. His hair looks thicker and feels softer. I&#x27;ve been using  the oil on the dry ends of my hair as well. This really works wonders on all types of hair. Be sure not to use too much as it will create a greasy look. Just a few drops will do! This is a wonderful product that I plan on buying again.</li>
    <li> I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use to by this oil in the health store, but it&#x27;s more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;great moisturizer, has healing affect, bacteria killing, and much more...&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more when I run out!</li>
    <li> I love this emu oil. I have been using a different brand for the past 5 years. It was pretty good but had a slight oder and was more expensive. I decided to give this a try and I love it. No oder and very good quality.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It takes care of aches and pains. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. I even use it on my face! I took it to work with me and let all my friends try it and guess what- I get to order several bottles for all my friends. This is the best thing ever. ( ok, maybe pizza is my favorite thing ever)</li>
    <li> I read these reviews to see what all of the fuss was about regarding Emu Oil.  Sounds like good stuff but I hear complaints.  Three months ago I discovered coconut oil.  I am now using it for EVERYTHING! It&#x27;s my only moisturizer.  I&#x27;m 62 and it is getting rid of awful sun damaged skin on my chest which is a miracle for me.  I cook with it.  It&#x27;s great for scrambling eggs or putting in your coffee.  The oil when eaten does wonders for the digestive system.  I could go on and on. Google coconut oil and oil pulling with coconut oil and see for yourself.  There are thousands of 5 star reviews.  So don&#x27;t worry about going to bed feeling like a slathered up pig.  This stuff is easy to apply and soaks in quite quickly.  It is a solid until about 76 degrees then it will liquify. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have acne prone skin and use just a pea size amount after a chemical peel.  It makes my skin pliable and stops the cracking around my mouth which can be quite painful when I try to eat.  I will purchase again if I ever run out of this batch :-)  It really does last a good long time.</li>
    <li> I love this oil but found the odor to be strong and unpleasant.  I have a very sensitive sense of smell so this may not be a problem for others.    For those who experience the same problem, add a few drops of your favorite scent in an aromatic oil, I used lavender, and the problem is resolved.</li>
    <li> Used for a few days and my acne is greatly reduced! My skin had a bad reaction to a lotion and I have been using this every night and it has smoothed out in just a few days! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love EMU Oil and its properties.  I put it in a pump bottle with a few other oils I like (Jojoba, Argan, shea butter oil, etc) and just use it for a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried three brands of EMU, and all were great, so I give them all five stars.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time or before expected, and intact. Which was very nice as I needed to take it with me on vacation. It is the only thing I have found to relieve the burning, on fire feeling I get from my foot to my thigh, from sciatica pain. And then when I apply biofeeeze over top of it, it is absolutely an unbelievable relief. It &amp;#34;puts the fire out&amp;#34;. It also works well on burns. There are so many good uses for it.</li>
    <li> WOW....... i was wowed with the size of these two little bottles..... then i was wowed with the oil -omg-  the way my skin feels with this oil is so great... i would have given 5 stars but the size of these bottles hurt my feelings.... but its some really great oil. No smell, very silky, creamy/oily but your skin will quickly absorb it..... i cant say anything bad about it---- just the size...4****</li>
    <li> I have never used a product with such health benefits as this Emu Oil. I gained weight after my second child and I was unable to walk without being in excruciating pain. I noticed that spider veins had developed around my ankles and I was in constant pain. I tried to lose weight by exercising but every time I would walk or attempt a light jog I wound up with severely swollen and sore ankles and knees. I used this oil from my knees down to my ankles and 2 days later I noticed a slight difference. Within 2 weeks I was walking with no pain at all. I am now training with a personal trainer and have lost over 10 pounds so far. I will be running a 5K in January for the first time in my life and I am 45 years old. I am in tears as I write this review because I have a better quality of life now and I am thankful. It feels good to be able to do the little things like clean my house without stopping after 15 minutes because of the pain. I always keep an extra bottle of this oil on hand because it also heals minor scraps and abrasions too!</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is not bad. I&#x27;ve seen better, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal. However, a friend of mine just went to Australia and brought back very good quality Emu oil at a fraction of the cost. Of course, not everyone has that luxury.</li>
    <li> I started noticing after  just a few days used  that i started having so many breakouts on my skin.....I am so sad because my skin had been clear zero breakout and now my face is covered with pimples and scars from them... I have been using this for my hair also and it&#x27;ll be a month soon but I don&#x27;t see any result and the worst thing is that I get pimples on my sculpt too... What have I been doing wrong?!? Why I don&#x27;t get great results like so many people reviewed this oil...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this worked very well, as other reviews stated...for them. I began using the product and loved how it felt...it moisturized VERY well and I could see how, in time, it might have gotten to be a favorite...but then I started getting red, itchy bumps...not small ones, either. For one rather large one on my chest, it took almost two weeks to heal. There must be something in the oil I am allergic to...or I am flat out allergic to the emu itself!</li>
    <li> I received a great deal on this oil when I purchased it. I got two for the price of one. This oil is super absorbent and a little goes along way. The shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will continue ordering it.  Emu oil has been a wonderful &amp;#34;face cream&amp;#34; for me, almost replacing my expensive department store products.  It defies the stereotype of oils, for it soaks into the skin readily.</li>
    <li> I read that this stuff was good for thinning hair - it is! I have had a spot, almost like a receding hairline, for years! At under 30, this is not something you want to see. I tried Rogain, Nioxin, Argan oil... none of that worked.  I used this and maybe one month later I had new hair growth! Simply amazing.  Not only that, but there are so many other uses for it.  I also used it on my feet for cracked heels, and my feet were noticeably softer within 3 days. I bought this several times now. Great find!</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this oil! I recently stumbled upon it and I am thrilled to have found this product.  I had been suffering with eczema for many months and my condition was really becoming VERY painful.  As soon as I received this product I applied it.  I apply it multiple times, as needed.  The oil started working on my poor cracked and irritated skin right away.  I used this product (no other product) and went on a 100% gluten free diet and I have seen a complete turn around.  In less than a week my skin is nearly back to normal!  I will continue to use this product and believe I will experience complete healing (meaning skin will be even softer) within the next couple days, that is as long as I keep with the gluten free diet, which I intend to do.  Do not hesitate to purchase this product if you are suffering with eczema, you will not regret it.  I have no personal gain from sharing this information with you.  I simply know how painful my experience was and I&#x27;m amazed at the results of this oil. I only wish I had stumbled upon it sooner.</li>
    <li> I had some breakage at the hairline of my head and it was getting bigger, so I decided to just spend the money and buy this product. I started using it December 18, and a month later, I started noticing growth. About two weeks later, I definitely knew my hair had grown. It did not thicken my hair, but it definitely made it grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it for scar fading or eyelash growth or on my face. It made my eyes sting a little and so I decided not to bother anymore. And it did not give me overnight moisturizing results on my face that so many people claimed. BUT for hair growth, it&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
    <li> Love the pure emu oil the delivery was quick and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Emu oil is good for a lot of things, but I brought it for sore muscles and it works great!  I could cut back on taking Alieves for my aches and pains. I also started using it as a moisturizer and its better than some expensive brands.  I would buy this products again and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was prompted by amazon to leave feedback. I had actually wanted to wait at least a week as I have only been using the emu oil for four days. I purchased the oil to help me with a \\&quot;nasty\\&quot; moderate case of eczema. According to all of the information on the internet (that is backed up with very little scientific research, data or documentation) emu oil is a wonder oil. However, I personally put stock in what customers say about the different things that the emu oil has did for various conditions that they are experiencing. Scientific research on a product is very important to me. I gave the product five stars because it practically alleviates itchy skin on contact although I am having to re-apply 2-3 times a day. I am hoping that it can help the scarring from all the stratching that I did to my skin. Anyone suffering from eczema knows that the itching is unbearable. If you can get the itching under control that is more than half the better. The skin on my legs have been severely compromised from the scratching. I was hoping that this oil would help to eradicate the scarring and I know that this will take time \\&quot;IF\\&quot; it can do it at all. The oil feels good against the skin and is extremely moisturizing. This brand of emu oil is the only one that I have tried and does moisturize the skin. On the parts of my body that is not affected by the eczema it makes the skin looks so pretty. I am hoping and praying it helps with the scarring so that I can wear shorts this summer. I had to cut my short season off early last August due to my unsightly legs. Also, I am a black woman with natural hair and this oil is wonderful on my hair. Although I bought the emu oil for the eczema it makes the hair soft, manageable and shiny. Although it is still early in the game I believe that this oil is very beneficial to the skin. 100% unrefined shea butter is also an excellent product to use on skin condition such as eczema and drinking oolong tea. They are two other products that I am using and that has helped my situation improve dramatically.</li>
    <li> I use emu oil for EVERYTHING from sunburn to frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s great on scraped knees, dry skin and misc rash.  I have tried many brands but this is the best.  Soaks in quickly and has no scent.</li>
    <li> My mom introduced me to this oil a little over a week ago. I am skeptical by nature and do not believe in miracle products. After a week of using this on my face twice a day I can say I am pleasantly surprised. It has diminished the look of my crows feet and forehead lines. My face is like silk now. I had a problem with scaling after washing my face. That is not a problem after only a week. I also notice I am not getting acne. I feel a bump start to form but by morning it is gone. It is also diminishing the age bumps I have been getting around my neck. So all in all, I will keep buying and using this oil. It did not give miracles, it just did what it said it would do. My husband says the change in the softness of my face is noticeable  I do recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it daily! Works wonders &amp; makes my skin feel soft! I&#x27;ve even recommended it to a few family members &amp; they love it too!</li>
    <li> -Good shipping and packing. I feel the product has good quality, I use it for minor joint discomfort and its very helpful. I will continue purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> It does everything it claims to do and more. I would recommed it to everyone I know you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good that the Emu Oil is odorless and non-sticky, but it seems that it can&#x27;t help me much as to eliminate the pain&lt;br /&gt;on my right thumb down the wrist. I guess I got hurt by heavy lifting. I have tried it for about 2 weeks, and I will keep&lt;br /&gt;on trying. Hopefully it will help me to feel better.</li>
    <li> this oil is absolutely wonderful It heals the skin so well and fast! I think every person should have a bottle</li>
    <li> USING PRODUCT ON SCALP ESPECIALLY @ THE TEMPLE AREAS. APPEARS HAIR IS FILLING IN WITHIN APPROX. A FEW DAYS AFTER USING.  EXTREMELY OILY.  NO NOTICEABLE FRAGRANCE TO MENTION.. DID RECEIVE PKG. WITH THE TWO BOTTLES WHICH  WERE PKGED.. WELL. NO COMPLAINTS.</li>
    <li> This oil is everything they say it is.  I love the way it absorbs into the skin so quickly.  And such a great price! I will be buying from this company again.</li>
    <li> this oil is a must if you have dry skin like me. I will reorder for more in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the great reviews and I have to say, I&#x27;m not impressed.  Perhaps I just have super high expectations but I have used another brand of Emu Oil in the past and it just seemed to work better.  I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this &amp; so far can tell no difference then regular lotion.I gave a bottle to my daughter &amp; she says the same</li>
    <li> This is a very good product since I bought it I have had very good results, and I really recommend ti.</li>
    <li> I have used other Emu Oils and this is the best by far. The fact that I use it on my face and don&#x27;t breakout, confirms to me that this is a very clean pure Oil. I have ordered from this company 3 times and the product has been consistently great.&lt;br /&gt;Use it on your skin and hair as it absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s scent free, however it is oil from a bird. So even though you may not be able to detect a scent, be prepared if you have a dog cause they surely can. I jokingly call my dog \\&quot;sneaky licks\\&quot; because she&#x27;ll get down into this stealth like crawl trying to steal quick little licks off my legs and toes. Lol, what a goof.</li>
    <li> This oil is a wonder potion!  I use it everywhere - on my hair, face, rough spots, stretch marks, scars, for bug bugs, etc.  I was hesitate at first about using it on my face, because I am acne prone and have oily skin, however after using it now for about two months my skin looks incredible!!!  I think it is actually working to fade older acne scars on my face.  I also rub it on my scalp nightly and my hair just shines.  I no longer see much of hair shedding in the shower drain either and my hair seems thicker.  It washes out easily in the morning.</li>
    <li> Awesome 💕 💕  product for the most sensitive  skin, and skin conditions</li>
    <li> I got a sample of Emu oil and loved it.  I wanted to start using it regularly for my face.  I tend to have dry/mixed skin, but heavy moisturizers make my face break out.  The Emu oil is the best product I&#x27;ve tried.  It makes my skin SO smooth and moisturized, without feeling oily or dirty.  This product is a lot less expensive than what others are selling it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is a WIN.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used emu oil for about the last ten years.  I bought this for my daughter.  She loves it.  Best Moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have had dry, feet (possibly a fungus) since we went in a hot tub on a cruise a couple of years ago, and this emu oil has helped to clear that up for both of us. We are quite happy with this product.</li>
    <li> good for wrinkles, hilling.last for a long time, not expensive, and i would recommed it to people, and it is natural.</li>
    <li> Years ago a friend gave me another brand of emu oil, which worked wonders for my back injury. The bottle was accidentally trashed afterwards, but I bought this one because it looked a lot like the other one.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s definitely not the same product.  The first thing I noticed was that this oil is odorless, unlike the other one which had a distinct smell.  So far it hasn&#x27;t helped my back.  I decided to try it on my hair after reading the good reviews about it, but after only a few applications I presume it&#x27;s too early to tell whether it will thicken up the thinning area around my temples.  Hoping for good results.</li>
    <li> USE ON CUTS AND ABRASIONS  SUPPOSED TO BE FOR PEOPLE ANDIF IT WORKS ON ANIMALS IT WILL WORK FOR YOU TOO !</li>
    <li> I added emu oil to my lotion and use the mixture on my feet after exfoliating the dry skin.  Makes the soles of my feet soft and they stay that way longer.</li>
    <li> Truly awesome products.  Customers are always requesting my products with emu oil and you guys filled that requirement.  I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> SAME AS PREVIOUS ONE.  JUST WANTED MORE OF IT,  EVERYONE I LET TRY IT WANTS ONE.LIKE IT .THANKS A LOT</li>
    <li> Was and is wonderful.  Highly recommend,  As good as higher priced bottles at the specialty stores.  Will continually reorder this item</li>
    <li> High quality emu oil. Wonderful company. Product works well on 7 layers of skin and pulls everything that I apply with it into those 7 layers. Amazingly simple and wonderfully effective!</li>
    <li> This oil is smooth and &#x27;dry&#x27; and different. It works well and has a mild, pleasant odor. This has been dubbed my &#x27;oddest&#x27; purchase by friends, but I really love it!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen result in 2 weeks after using emu oil. I am using this for my hair line and I started to see good result, I would like to continue using this emu oil.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful skin oil, and has helped my skin become healthier and more resilient. Absorbs in completely, no oily residue.</li>
    <li> Love Emu Oil for my VERY sensitive skin.  I use this also in my simple sugar scrub I make for myself.</li>
    <li> The texture is very fine, nourish skin well, fragrance free I do not smell anything.it is light, natural, yes a bit pricy compared with other oils but still cheap compared with those fancy face serum. I rub on face and body then apply cream afterwards to double moisture my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again, but will always keep in mind, if it is on sale or I visit Austria by myself, I will definitely purchase a large amount.&lt;br /&gt;Other oils are much cheaper but this emu oil is very good oil too, and best part is it is much less greasy. I like it.</li>
    <li> Thus far I have enjoyed the emu oil. I use it on my face and my hair  this is the first time I&#x27;ve used emu oil. I plan to continue. As I see results I&#x27;ll try to post about them</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I add it to my lotion, use it on my face, and hair.  It&#x27;s a cure all.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome. I use it when my hands get very dry and it softens them immediately. I also use it once a week around areas prone to wrinkles (eyes, mouth, etc) and I am 38 without wrinkles. I also use  borage seed  oil with it. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles out sunspots. I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s because of this or good genes, but I live in the desert where I send a lot of time in the hot sun.</li>
    <li> I have used several synthetic hair oils. Also argan oil and coconut oil. I like this the best because it is very light. Does not weigh my hair down like the others. I have frizzy wavy/curly hair and this oil really helps. I usually put a little on my hair after showering and run a comb through it to disperse. Also have used it on my face and hands. Soaks in quickly. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> High quality oil. Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Use it on my face and as a healing salve on &amp;#34;troubled&amp;#34; skin.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> 38 yrs old, wrinkles disappeared, my pallor was replaced with a glowing complexion with rosy cheeks which lasted for few yrs now after stopping it. ordering again to try it on my arthritis.</li>
    <li> Works great not a  greasy feeling. Almost seems it makes shin smooth.</li>
    <li> Yes it is a good oil and thin as oil should be, Soothing bt as some said it I gea for your hair it has done nothing for mine. Perhaps old age,  Bu happy with it</li>
    <li> It could be baby oil for all I know, but it isn&#x27;t smelly, just oily.</li>
    <li> Worked and arrived as described!! I had no problems w/ the product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the pleasant experience. Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. I purchased it for 2 reasons. One reason is for my Targus piercing.  It really helped with the healing and two for hair growth. I see some growth around my edges,  which were damaged. Time will tell how well it works on my hair.</li>
    <li> I liked this product alot.  it absorbed really well into my skin and didnt feel or look oily it meshed extremely well with the makeup that i use.  I use it on my scalp and noticed my hair looked really shiny and healthy. I even noticed new growth  and family and coworkers comment on my hair now.  I will definately buy it again.</li>
    <li> I rub this oil on my face, neck and my feet every night. My skin is much smoother! I also use as a massage oil and it works wonderful and leaves my skin feeling so soft. I will buy this forever.</li>
    <li> a buddy recommended when I saw him use it when we were skiing..I bought same brand...I used it on inner thighs since my skin gets so dry in Michigan winter. I also used it on my ear..It truly worked! typicially the only thing that would work in past is cortisone cream but that is not good for continual use..this is a nice safer more effective alternative..oh and it does not have a strong smell so also good, especially on face</li>
    <li> Help stop scalp irritation. Will recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a very dry spot that I get in the bend of my arm.  I was expecting a better result. Honestly its just OK.  It didn&#x27;t really help the healing process and it didn&#x27;t stop the itch.  I had better results with GoldBond lotion.  It does moisturize because its an oil.  It has virtually no scent but it wasn&#x27;t the miracle oil I was expecting after reading some of the reviews.  The seller did a great job on the packaging &amp; it arrived very timely.</li>
    <li> I have been using emu oil for my face and this is the 3rd company I have been ordering. I would say this is the best emu oil and I use it in my face my hair and even if after I burn my hand from cooking as soon as I put emu oil the pain has stopped and no blister from the burn spot. My skin is so soft and flawless. I definitely ordering this again..Thanks for this company. They make a good quality of emu oil.</li>
    <li> Great for burns and abrasions.  Emu oil is really the only thing that calms my skin down after an over-zealous exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Will be reordering this product. It happens to be a main ingredient in a very high end shop in London ( Margaret Dobbs, most expensive pedicure , does the queens feet, etc ) Well, I ordered a few items from the Dobbs line, and I do love the products. ( Their foot file cannot be beat ) but, I LOVE this “pure” emu oil. I’ve put a few drops into a spritzer bottle for my leave in hair conditioner, use it on my nails, both hands and feet. And, even add a few drops to my regular lotion. It does what it says. It is just a great all around moisture retainer without being greasy or oily (even though it’s called “oil”)  It’s a great product and this price is the best I’ve found anywhere. Especially for the pure product. (beware of those with additives, they are NOT the same quality wise) I would get onto an auto replenish program for this product if they offered it. I just hope it never goes away!</li>
    <li> My wonderful esthetician introduced me to emu oil and its benefits for your skin.  I use this as an all-over moisturizer.  One of the best kept secrets is that it will reduce the effects of a sunburn overnight.  I have very fair skin, but love the sun.  If I end up a bit red (even with sunscreen) after a day at the pool, I put this on and by morning the redness is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the brand that she carries (I haven&#x27;t found that one on Amazon) but this is the same consistency as the one that she uses.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is the perfect light moisturizing oil. I use it for my daily facial moisturizer, my hair, and the rest of my body. It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth without being greasy like lotion and it gives my hair that perfect &amp;#34;wet look,&amp;#34; again without being greasy.  If I ever have dry or chapped lips I use it on that too and instantly they feel better! This is an A++ product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you buy it.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this Emu Oil. A little really does go a long way...I&#x27;ve been using this on my face, scalp and post-baby belly for my stretch marks. I have dry skin, but clear skin...I apply this oil right after I wash my face, it makes my skin appear flawless..I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but my fines lines aren&#x27;t that visible anymore. I make my own skin care products for my family...so I will be adding this to our shampoo, conditioner and body creams, but not too much of it...it cost a pretty penny. This is one of those oils I will probably not tell my friends about, I don&#x27;t want to give them too many of my beauty secrets. I gave this product 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see all the benefits.</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me. The shampoo &amp; conditioner also helped.  I got my order super fast. I will be reordering soon.</li>
    <li> Bought this to help restore my husband&#x27;s hair. He used it with Rogaine and seems to be working - hair is growing in his bald spot. Using only Rogaine was a very slow process. The emul oil seemed to give it a boost.  Only gave 4 stars because of the price - would like for it be cheaper or receive a larger quantity for the price.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and generally dry skin on my legs.  Between daily exfoliation with Simple Sugars body scrub and use of this emu oil I my psoriasis is 80% improved.  I also use this oil on my arms and neck and it leaves my skin looking and feeling great!  Love it and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin very smooth and well moisturized, not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product since 2011 and never wrote a review about it. I have very bad skin, since I started using this product my face looks so beautiful. I don&#x27;t like to writ review but couldn&#x27;t helped it. This thing is awesome and the seller is great!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for various aches and pains and as a carrier oil for vitamins and other substances.  Good value and great quality.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time.  Keeps my skin soft, smooth, and younger looking.  One bottle last about a month for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Emu oil for my scalp to wake up some follicles, I must say, I am imprest with the results. I will be buying this Item again.</li>
    <li> if you have minor aches  it is perfect solution  ,and you don&#x27;t smell like a pharmacy</li>
    <li> This item is so moisturizering. I give it two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Truly useful for all kinds of dry zones on your body. I think a couple of lines even disappeared on my face!</li>
    <li> As described. Milky white in color. Can&#x27;t beat the price for this product</li>
    <li> I bought the Emu oil for my Dad based on recommendation by my boyfriend.  My Dad has been experiencing unbearable pain on his right knee &amp; elbow. He&#x27;s in so much pain that he can barely climb the stairs to the bedroom. After applying &amp; rubbing the oil on the problem areas consistently/regularly he no longer feels any pain on both areas. He no longer has any problem walking up the stairs nor feel pain on his elbow when he wakes in the morning. He also has been able to get some of his friends &amp; family to try &amp; all are regular users of this oil now.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it every day. Very soothing and penetrating. This is the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Have used for years and will continue.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and seems like a very good product.The price was fair . I would certainly buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I know that emu oil can be expensive, but the higher quality oil is worth the extra expense.  I bought two different emu oil products for my kids&#x27; eczema and the more expensive product was by far superior</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I have very dry skin. Put some on every night. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister. She has varicous veins and she rubs this oil on her legs and feet and says that it helps. I&#x27;m aware it is good to put on sunburns and for the last 2 months I have been using it on my face as a moisturizer and I noticed how my eyelashes seem to be longer and I have more of them.  I would purchase product again.</li>
    <li> have used this product now, specifically, this brand and will be coming back as needed; the product delivers....nongreasy, healing, quickly absorbed into skin</li>
    <li> Full disclosure - I was originally sent a single 4oz bottle of this emu oil. However I have since purchased more as I used up the sample and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the winter months I had some really tight muscles and this seemed to act as a light natural muscle relaxer. Nothing that was drastic but a more calming and immediate sensation once I applied it. I think there may be an actual scientific explanation for this but I haven&#x27;t delved into it too much because I&#x27;ve been busy lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for dry skin as an overnight treatment especially in the winter. Anything you topically use coconut oil for, you might try and use emu oil for. They seem similar yet different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no experience with other emu oils so I don&#x27;t know how this one compares to others. I will say that I noticed when shopping though that SOME emu oils are not pure emu oil and are mixed with other ingredients. THIS is pure emu oil, not diluted.</li>
    <li> This leaves a filmy residue  on hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a moisturizer for my skin.  I thought I could get more moisture for my skin if I added to my bath gel.  After about a week, I went to use a new bottle I had added the oil to.  This oil turn the consistency of my gel to a watery substance.  I thought someone added water to my bottle.  The gel was still useful but it acts as a thinner to your bath gels.</li>
    <li> A nice face moisturizer keeping it soft and young looking also radiates the hair to a nice healthy looking ...</li>
    <li> LOVE this oil.  Makes my skin feel so smooth.  I had a double mastectomy and several follow-up surgeries and I use the oil to help with scaring. It gives my skin so much moisture and rapidly soaks into the skin.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. plain and simple.  team emu oil up with a healthy diet and your skin and hair will be glowing :)</li>
    <li> This oil seemed all grainy, as if it had a pinch of fine sand mixed in.</li>
    <li> I waited until after I finished a complete bottle of this brand of emu oil to post a review of the product.  I purchased the product for use as described, as a simple skin and hair moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actual use/life of bottle: One 4-ounce bottle lasted a little over one month (using ½-1 ½ tsp. of oil daily - self and family).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a skin moisturizer: I live in Michigan and used it August 10-September 16, these are Michigan&#x27;s warmer months. I did not have a great need for a moisturizer but used this product on areas where I have dry spots (on ankle tattoos, and on the back of upper arms). I found that the moisturizer worked fairly well but it did not do anything above or beyond what a quality, more affordable lotion would have. The areas that I applied the emu oil to remained moisturized all day, but much like lotion, you must apply it daily. If I were to use this solely for skin moisturizing purchases, I would not purchase particular product again - maybe a more affordable blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a hair moisturizer: My hair type is normally at 4a/b, but I texlax my hair with a regular strength relaxer every 12 weeks for 5 minutes so I am somewhere between a 3b and 4b (varies &amp; includes new hair growth). I tried the 6-drop method of emu oil as described on the product page but did not find that it was effective for my hair. I had to apply approximately one teaspoon of the oil to my hair in its dry state. As a hair moisturizer on dry hair it worked okay once I adjusted the amount to the needs of my hair but I did not feel like my hair was deeply moisturized, just oiled. *** I found it more effective to apply the oil on non-wash days ½ hour before I shower. I applied about a ½ teaspoon to my hair (dry) and stepped into a steamy shower. My hair absorbed the oil MUCH better and it was not necessary to reapply the next day if I wore a bun or protective style (although I applied to my ends anyway) ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this as a hair moisturizer but every hair type is different. My daughter whose hair is 3a (defined curls) naturally does not respond to this oil at all, her hair responds better to coconut oil on dry hair or water based leave in conditioner (aussie), wet or dry. My son&#x27;s 3b hair (curls, but slightly thicker and harder to define - in a short Mohawk) loves this oil. My son gets great curl definition and shine. My husband is 1b/2a (straight with some slight wave) only needs a small amount, and found it nice to mix with another product he uses when his hair must be styled for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few words of caution: I had to make sure my hair was clear of this oil before I flat ironed. Flat Iron + Emu Oil, does not equal hair health and does not smell very good. I also would advise anyone to stop using it completely at least a week before any chemical treatment (even a 5 min. texlax). This oil penetrates the skin approximately 7 layers, you do not want a chemical treatment responding to/interacting with this oil. I would also encourage you to wait at least three days after a chemical treatment, AND after a follow-up wash for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand of emu oil is good. I have one bottle left from my two-bottle set. I will be trying another brand only because it was provided by my vitamin supplier and is slightly more affordable, but I definitely would use this brand/seller again.  4/5 only because I did not feel it was the best skin moisturizer and for hair, may not work for everyone. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It has reduced the severity of my wife&#x27;s brusing and has prevented much of it also.  It is the first thing she ever found that worked.</li>
    <li> Have tried different brands of Emu Oil but this one is best.  I have my boyfriend using it too and he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Many uses....sunburn, dry, itchy skin, bug bites!!</li>
    <li> It is working great for me, I am using it on my surgery site / past radiation site and it&#x27;s taking away the redness and helping to thicken my damaged skin.</li>
    <li> my husband has a big black bruse on his leg been putting it on it two weeks looking great</li>
    <li> excellent for winter skin. good value</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a great moisturizer and I did some research about this oil. I decided to trying and I&#x27;m gladi did. My skin looks great! It is so soft and I look like I have a healthy glow especially during these cold winter months where I work outside sometimes. I have used it on my hair, which had been damaged from highlights and now my hair feels like new again. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I bought this and I love it. I want to buy another just to use on my body because the bottle is small and I want to use it mainly for my face for now. I will always buy this from now on.</li>
    <li> i bought this oil about a year ago thru Amazon....it&#x27;s a fantastic product...great on skin and hair....long lasting too....highly recomended.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for my scars for more than a year now. My scars have been fading away.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years and love it.  I am in my 60&#x27;s and my skin is wrinkle-free, more or less, as it is constantly moisturized with this emu oil.  I have wondered how--when I finally find someone to re-marry--I will use it at night as I do now, because you look like a greased pig with it all over your face; BUT, it WORKS!    If there is another brand that is better I wish someone would tell me.  I love, love, love this stuff!  And the company is very conscientious, too!  Excellent service, excellent product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for my wife and she likes it a lot.  She&#x27;s fond of it because it gives her a healthy looking skin, which is a dream for every woman.</li>
    <li> Smells like old turkey all the time. My wife bought this and she had to stop using it because it smelled like poultry all the time in the house.</li>
    <li> I use this Emu Oil mixed with ponds and my skin is great...always receiving compliments. Does not smell, use sparingly so your skin can absorb.</li>
    <li> I have used two other brands of emu oil - one had a sickening animal fat smell that got worse over time; I finally had to throw it away because the smell made me sick to my stomach. It was also thick and very creamy looking. The other was one of those triple refined emu oils whose only advantage seems to be that it was completely clear. Both stayed on my face well past application. This emu oil absorbs immediately so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m ready to fry. It is not as thick and creamy as the other brand, although it is not completely clear.  Not an issue for me. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Great product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> good on the skin and painful joints and muscles, it works. I am satisfied&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my hair too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  This brings moisture without irritation or breakouts.  This is very inexpensive compared to buying in the store.</li>
    <li> I did not try to find emu oil locally, but was pleased to find it.  Delivery was very speedy and I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction.  Highly recommend!  AAAAA+++++</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good product but too greasy for the face. You need something more fine to put on your face first and use this product for the last layer. But very convenient for hair, body, and face.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way so you&#x27;re using too much if your face looks like a greased pig. People need to learn how to read and follow the directions on the label.  I use a couple of drops for my face and I use four drops on my hair (after I dampen my hair first to help it penetrate and close my cuticles). My skin doesn&#x27;t break out like it use to when I was using Shea Butter and I no longer have dry areas on my face. My hair is shiny and very pretty.</li>
    <li> I have been using it in face in winters . Great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and quality product.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product the first time I used it. It really nourishes my skin and hair. I mostly use it at night and then wash it out in the morning. It leaves my hair so silky smooth! Of course, I have to shampoo twice to fully cleanse my hair. If I only shampoo once, it makes my hair too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that if I apply it to wounds, specifically burns, that they heal much quicker. I think this is a wonderful product, so I always make sure to keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite skin products. Absolutely great for moisturizing skin!</li>
    <li> Every winter my scalp (and rest of my skin) gets uncomfortably dry.  This winter, once the itching started driving my crazy, I started looking around for an alternative to the Aveda Scalp Relief that had saved my sanity the previous few years, until they changed the formula to one that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well for me.  The emu oil reviews touted a product that sounded too good to be true; I&#x27;m sad to say that it is.  I&#x27;m very happy for everyone that is helped by this product and had really hoped that this product would at least help a bit, if not be a miracle.  Alas, for me it&#x27;s not perceptibly effective, and certainly is not better than the new Aveda formula which I was hoping to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first few weeks, I tried a few drops spread over my scalp a couple nights a week (the days before I was planning to wash my hair -- even a small amount adds a noticeably greasy texture and appearance to my hair).  It wasn&#x27;t making any perceptible difference, so I tried using more.  The only difference that \\&quot;more\\&quot; made was to make the slightly poultry-like odor of the oil more noticeable, and convince me to put a really old pillow case on my pillow overnight so I didn&#x27;t leave oil stains on my good sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this on my toddlers, who had a couple of dry patches in their hair (like cradle cap) -- I&#x27;d leave it in for a couple of hours before bath time.  After several sessions, it eventually softened the patches enough that I had mostly scrubbed them off, but it didn&#x27;t work any better than the olive oil I&#x27;d used when they were babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m now left with most of two bottles of product sitting on a shelf, unused and unlikely to be used next winter -- I&#x27;ll look for something else. The product certainly didn&#x27;t seem to harm anything (except my wallet), but as far as I can tell it is just oil and no more efficacious than something you&#x27;ll find in your kitchen.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help my wife&#x27;s dry scalp.  This product is truly pure Emu oil.  I have had other types of Emu Oil and they were diluted.  This was not.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a scalp moisturizer and also b/c I read it helps break down hair product residue to keep your hair growing healthy. Also not as greasy as most hair oils you find.</li>
    <li> Be careful not to use too much!  Follow the directions and your hair will be silky but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I bought this because my hair is thinning and I was hoping it&#x27;d help a bit.  I&#x27;m certainly not growing new hair (and the makers never promise this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t buy this if you think it&#x27;ll grow new hair.  I don&#x27;t buy into the other &amp;#34;its a miracle!!&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
    <li> This product like many natural cures and aides is not one that will give instant results.  But if you continue to use it for a few days you will see improvements.  It is a subtle yet effective to relieve pain and discomfort.</li>
    <li> I purchased one bottle and loved it so much i started sharing.  I think its light and does not clog your pores and I will be purchasing this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> Thiis product is so Amazing- I love it!!!!!!!  Well worth the money I highly recommend this product. I am so happy I purchased it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!  My skin looks more than amazing!  I use it all over and love the effects on my skin!</li>
    <li> This product was better than I expected and has multiple uses.  At night I mix a few drops into my face cream. I&#x27;ve read that Emu oil goes deeper into the skin than any other oil.  I also use it by itself on my face and neck and then rub in extra into my hands and my hair.  Just know that a little does go a long way.  This product hasn&#x27;t broken my face out like some face oils do.  I</li>
    <li> Since I moved to colder weather my lips and skin in general has been super dry. I heard about emu oil through a friend of mine and now i&#x27;m hooked! My lips healed up in a matter of days after I started applying this to them. Now I use it regularly, i&#x27;ll never use a different moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Pretty much did nothing.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time with my essential oils.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I probably didn&#x27;t give this much of a chance before I sent it back. So I am not a very good judge. I just didn&#x27;t like the oily feeling with it on my face. Not sure what I expected, after all it is an oil.</li>
    <li> This product is really good.</li>
    <li> Has made my daughters hair soft and silky.  I could swear it has grown since she has been using it.  Plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> Does the job. It&#x27;s super moisturizing so it is a little greasy - it&#x27;s an oil after all, but great for putting around your eyes or rubbing a little into the ends of stressed hair.</li>
    <li> As a person with really dry skin I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers but always seem to be looking for the right one. Emu oil is, well oily so you can&#x27;t use more than a little at a time and I find it works best when applied to wet skin as this helps it spread evenly with a few drops. Once it&#x27;s applied though I get all day relief and never have to apply more.</li>
    <li> GREAT product I use it on my knee joints,the Emu oil relieves the stiffness .Also I rub the oil on sore muscles after a weight lifting session . Last year i had a Hip replacement ,I began rubbing the sight of the operation with Emu oil upon doing this the motion in the hip is much more fluid, I am very HAPPY with the pure emu oil ,I will buy again,another thing about the product is you do not have to use much.</li>
    <li> I started using Emu oil late last year, and absolutely love the way it make my skin look!  I can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> It seems to soak into the skin well and alleviate dryness very well.  My dry spots have dissipated.  We are using it to combat stretch marks during pregnancy as well because it is one of the only moisturizers that can penetrate to the dermis.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I rate this product 5 stars because the benefits of this product are extraordinary. I cannot take Nsaids drugs for osteoarthritis. I find that this products aids in reducing joint pain caused by my arthritis.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for your money.  I will purchase this product again.  I&#x27;ve also recommended it to other people as well.</li>
    <li> Emu oil is amazing and everyone should own some! No matter what kind of person you are, this can benefit you in some way. look up the benefits! I use mine to moisturize my sensitive face and it has started to fade some acne scars.</li>
    <li> The softest oil I have, I love it and it&#x27;s great for your skin and hair. Emu oil penetrates all layers of your skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second order for this amazing oil. Its thick and easy to use. Neutral to no scent. Absorbs well. During psoriasis flare ups, this oil keeps my skin moist/hydrated. After a day or two, the thicker scales come right off revealing supple new skin that is easier to treat with rx topicals. Also keeps the cracking/itchy feeling at bay.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for someone with psoriasis that swears by the effects of Emu oil for her condition</li>
    <li> I purchased it because of bug bits I got from camping out. It is first time using Emu Oil it was quite effective&lt;br /&gt;on reliving ichy.  It kind of smoothed my skin as well.  I read other review and it seems this Emu Oil can be used&lt;br /&gt;for other things as well.  Smell did not bother me like other review mentioned</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in my skin as I bought this to try and minimize small wrinkles. I am NOT a botox fan.  I use at night and in the morning.  HIgh quality oil.  A little goes a long way :)  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my son.  He is currently undergoing radiation and emu oil was mentioned by a cancer survivor.  The emu oil did a great job keeping his effected area moist.</li>
    <li> Solves dry skin and repairs cracked skin excellent. No smell, not greasy, and soaks into your skin. It will also helps with the aches and pains. So far I have purchased four bottles and it never disappointed me. Shipping was super fast and packaged well. Try it and you will become a believer in Emu Oil as well.</li>
    <li> I have used several brands in the last couple of years ......this will be the one I will be reordering from now on !&lt;br /&gt;Does its job solo or blended with your favorite lite cream.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often, but I had to make the time to write one for this emu oil. I&#x27;m amazed at how it moisturizes my hair. Im black with type 4 hair for those who want to know. My hair stays so soft, and the oil is not heavy like castor oil or glycerine. It&#x27;s also been making my skin so pretty and smooth, scars are fading away. My only regret is not buying this oil sooner. I can see myself using this product for a long long time.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Referred to me by a family member and I never regret ordering it. Here&#x27;s what it did for us:&lt;br /&gt;Stopped swelling and pain in knees within 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;Helped my husbands pulled back in 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Stopped pain in arthritic finger in 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;So much more! Don&#x27;t believe it? Look it up in the internet on WebMd! It&#x27;s amazing and we are proof!</li>
    <li> I have not seen many results yet but i am waiting patiently . I did use it on my streach marks and they are looking lighter</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week now makes my hair very soft and leaves it in great condition. Also been using it on my face and it really leaves my face moisturized and not oily. I have oily skin but this is light and makes my skin look and feel healthy.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price and good quality.</li>
    <li> It is white oil and I am using for my skin and hair. It is very good for skin and face.</li>
    <li> This is the best !  I carefully put it on my face as well, not to much but enough  that when I wake up in the morning my face is soft and glowing.  It is so great after a pedicure and wonderful on my arms and legs.  I will buy this again and again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple orders of this. So far so good, great to add to most solutions that you want an extra moisturizer in. In particular, it goes great in shampoo to keep it from drying out my hair.</li>
    <li> A friend let me try this from a bottle of Emu Oil she had.. it was greasy/smelled awful &amp;#34;old.&amp;#34; But she knew I suffered from lower back disk degeneration. I rubbed a tiny amount on the small of my back holding my nose :( and I got relief!!!! So I came home and got on line with Amazon, searched/read reviews on this product. Although relief is temporal and I&#x27;ve only been using it 2 weeks now, but it found it helps my lower back and hip issues.  I have shoulder/neck problems and well and it works there too. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does and I highly recommend it to anyone with &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; from spinal to arthritic. It&#x27;s so worth a try. I have refused to use pain meds if I could find an alternative/a natural method. I&#x27;ve found it! I definitely am going to be keeping it on hand and carry a tiny bottle in my purse so I&#x27;m never without.</li>
    <li> Emu oil serves as a good conditioner and moisturizer for the hair and the skin. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but the oil serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> The title says it all. I have found this product to be great for so many things... skin burns, cuts, and hair. Highly recommend it to anyone! This company was easy to work with and I received the package quickily.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST OIL ON EARTH! I have tried over 20 different oils (ex jojoba, Moroccan)and nothing compares to this! Next in line is sea buckthorn by sibu, but nothing compares to this emu oil. These bottles are very well priced, cheapest i ever found. They last a long time. I use this as a face moisturizer and it has helped my acne and wrinkles. It has natural vit E along with omega vitamins in it. It has absolutely no smell. I put it on at night, and in the morning my whole complexion is smooth and clearer. I have extremely sensitive skin and I react to almost everything! this product is so gentle there is nothing added, there is nothing your skin can react negatively too! Give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;(you probably only want to use it at night because its an oil)</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to every one.  I have used product on my face for the last two months.  It has truly transformed my face skin.  I will not longer buy any expensive cream and will use this product for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Use it on a daily basis. Keeps my skin from drying out. I also use it on my scalp and it seems to make it less itchy.</li>
    <li> But that&#x27;s probably just how the birds were raised or what they ate. Still worked like a charm. The last bottle I bought from a local emu farm didn&#x27;t smell though.</li>
    <li> I use this for my face and it feels great. Very moisturizing and seem to increase skin elasticity. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, so I can use it for the body every day. Really like this oil.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It does not make my skin appear oily or breakout. I have used it twice daily for over a year and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I bought this because during the wintertime I get extremely dry skin on my face.  I previously was using coconut oil and found that it was not moisturizing enough.  Reading all the good reviews on this product, I decided to try it out and it has been great.  I put it on at night before bed, then again in the morning and this has helped tremendously.  It really seems to be able to penetrate and moisturize for a long time.</li>
    <li> Multi-use ! great for skin, great to ease muscle/joint pain, gets rid of &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I tell everyone I know how great this is !</li>
    <li> I have used emu oil for the past 14 years as my daily facial &#x27;cream&#x27; and have used many different products.  This is definitely the best!  It is non-greasey and absorbs into the skin easily.  Another use for emu oil is to heal skin sores.  When my father started developing leg sores due to poor circulation, we used emu oil directly on the sores and they healed quickly.  Unfortunately, when he went into a nursing home, a wound care team took over his care and his sores came back (they wouldn&#x27;t use the emu oil).  I highly recommend this product for daily skin care and for skin sores!</li>
    <li> Premium stuff here. I use it on my dry really dry winter scalp and it made a difference in one use. I also use it for facial massage and as a moisturizer and also on my cuticles before and after manicures. It is lightweight.</li>
    <li> I swear by emu oil for cuts, burns, and even flaky skin on my face from too many beauty products or weather changes. It is a miracle product. Everyone should have a bottle in their homes, especially near the stove!</li>
    <li> As we get older our skin loses something.  Apparently this Emu Oil really helps to get your skin looking better. It appears to work for both my wife and I.</li>
    <li> And priced very nicely - pure and gentle and always good to have in the house.  Doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy after you rub it in - and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is very touchy.</li>
    <li> I have had eczema on my fingers for years and have tried steroid prescriptions to special lotions and pretty much everything under the sun.  Finally, I tried this product and I&#x27;m never going back!  A little goes a long way and I use it religiously every night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of EMU oil for my hair and skin and I&#x27;ve got to say I LOVE this product. It really moisturizes my hair and leaves it so soft. I would definitely recommend this to other people who normally use EVOO or jojoba oil for their hair.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin with eczema. So I cannot really use all those ultra-rich moisturizers out there in the market for extremely dry eczema skin. I used this for a week and already saw a vast improvement. I was unable to use it the following week, and my skin went back to being red with lots of flaking and dry scaly patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say though, that even with using this, I still do get dry scaly patches but this oil moisturizes them very well without making my skin feel clogged and oily. I also use this all over my body for general moisturization, and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some reviewers have claimed that you only need very little, I find that I need fair bit to actually moisturize. Maybe it depends on your skin type and how permeable your skin is? I put this on either right after toweling dry after a shower or before bed. It is absorbed fast, leaves my skin feeling nourished and moisturized, and best of all- it&#x27;s natural! No smell that I have noticed. I used to get a lot of acne, and that has completely gone away. This is with 3 weeks of use, once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well as a moisturizer for my pregnant belly! Skin on my belly feels supple and elastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it for my 4-year-old son for his eczema and it works well as a moisturizer. Again, his lesions do not seem to subside very quickly with this oil or decrease the lesion outbreaks, but it does work well as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister because I read it was great for psoriasis I haven&#x27;t heard yet how that is working for her yet but I also got myself a bottle because I read some of the other benefits.  I put it under my eyes and it has healed up a rough patch of skin under my eye that peels and I have been struggling with for almost a year!! I also feel that my skin looks brighter and better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was way fast product quality is great very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because I read a couple of reviews about it on this buyers page and also saw that it was recommended by a couple of doctors as being the best for stretch mark improvement/removal. This wont be a long review since I&#x27;ve only been using this product for three days. One thing I have noticed so far is that my stretch marks are smooth to touch. To clarify, I have stretch marks right underneath my butt; the back of the thigh area. Those stretch marks are the ones that you can actually feel when passing your hands on the skin. Its been three days and they are still visible but you cant feel them individually at all. It feels like its on the same surface as the skin around it, as though the skin has leveled out. I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference in the actual appearance of the stretch marks but I&#x27;ll keep you all posted on how everything goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh almost forgot to say I&#x27;m also using it for my hair. Just the front of it where the hair line is (receding issues) but I know thats suppose to take at least a month or so before you actually see result So I&#x27;ll let you know about that too</li>
    <li> This was my emu oil refill to the original bottle bought in Vermont cheese shop. It works magic on my skin. in addition to all the benefits listed on the bottle and &amp;#34;instruction&amp;#34; booklet, it heals severe cuts, burns, skin rushes and irritations. No cream stays close to emu oil qualities. I highly recommend this product. I tried to use emu oil from different manufactures, and the product is very similar. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Emu oil is an amazing product.  Reduces scarring, heals skin infection, works to get rid of dry skin...it&#x27;s just an amazing product.  This will most definately be in my reoccuring order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; ve been using this oil for awhile and it&#x27;s fantastic I like the way it makes my hair manageable i had bald spots and the  crown of my hair was gone buts it  has grown back  will continue to use and just be patient when you start using and watch it work the only reason I didn&#x27;t give a five star is I wish the price was a little lower so I can buy as gifts for my friends and family  thank you thank you thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful purchase; very pleased with product!  The push-button top provides a perfect method of dispensing the oil  There is no waste or mess, and very easy to pour.</li>
    <li> Hurry and buy this product. It does the body great</li>
    <li> My dog suffers with skin rashes and hair loss This product eases the scratching and soothes his skin.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> I was in a health store and came across a spray with emu oil it. I read the info on it and purchased a 4 oz  bottle.When I read the small print on the bottle I realized It was somewhat deceptive because it had many other ingredients that had a strong menthol scent. It also&lt;br /&gt;was the consistency of water. I shook it up and used it in my lower back sciatica problems and the back of my thighs. Some relief&lt;br /&gt;but short lived. But I was interested in learning more about emu oil and its pain relieving ability and skin benefits. So I did some research  on use of this by the Aborigines of Australia. I learned a lot. I wanted 100% pure oil .and off on new search to see who had the best and purest.. at a price I could afford. I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s wonderful on any part of the body does have pain&lt;br /&gt;relieving ability is quickly absorbed . It&#x27;s also great on face neck and chest where age shows first. I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin -sun protection-no smoking etc. moisturizers- but this really is noticeably  different . Face neck chest and hands are softer&lt;br /&gt;smoother and a glow. Delivery was prompt-I love this product and will reorder soon. Also a little goes a long way is absorbrd and does not feel greasy- makeup application over  this is very easy and stays in place.  milliesgirl</li>
    <li> This is the first time we ordered it &amp; My Wife loves this product &amp; has become a regular user.  it arrived on time .</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Been using for years! I&#x27;m a swimmer with very dry skin, this is fabulous! Very quick delivery! Will purchase more. My 25 yr. old daughter has started using mine!</li>
    <li> Product seems satisfactory in helping to ptovide some relief of dry skin during these winter months. Four more words, words.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for hair growth and it works wonders on the skin. You mix this with a carrier oil and rub on the scalp for hair growth. It can also be rubbed directly on the skin. It heals sores and cuts fast and it smooth scars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and really love it.  It&#x27;s smooth, silky and absorbs into the skin quickly.  I like to apply it to damp skin so I use less and it absorbs into the pores.</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this helping my psoriasis. It is an amazing product! I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  it&#x27;s nothing special and I really gave it a try too. I would not recommend this product to anyone, what it does, many on the market product can do.</li>
    <li> Great product! Finally found out after several attempts that you only need to use next to nothing. Very potent product but is great for my skin and hair. Definitely value for money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like any pil</li>
    <li> As an Ayurvedic Wellness Counselor, I have trained in body work and the use of numerous oils and herbs for healing and general health. The quality and results I&#x27;ve seen with this Emu oil from Koru Naturals have made it a wonderful addition to my treatment program. Works great for eczema.</li>
    <li> We love this brand. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Makes My hair a lot softer. If it grows I will do another review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/15/14  so I have used it 2x a day since I got it. I have noticed new hairs growing in. Now keep in mind that I also use organic coconut oil and eat 98 % organic. But it never grew before. So I am as of today gonna start applying 3 times a day. Which is what it says to do anyway I believe. I apply it most of the time about two hours before bed. then also in the morning. I wear a loose fitting cap like a Jamaican cap. I have to say I am quite impressed. give it a shot it can not hurt.</li>
    <li> I been using this for a couple weeks and is working real good mixed with castor oil.  Shipping was real quick. I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and on time</li>
    <li> Great oil to have in your beauty cabinet. Adds moisture without weighing down the hair. The best for dry winter scapl itch!</li>
    <li> Emu Oil is a healthy, natural moisturizer for your skin.  I have been very pleased with my purchases from this company which offers their product at an economical price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this emu oil. I&#x27;ve read some sites reviews touting to beware of adulterated emu oils because they lack potency. But O must say, this emu oil is just as potent as the last company I ordered from, but theirs cost less. It arrived earlier than stated. And it takes the pain and stiffness out of my back whenever it flares up! I&#x27;m still amazed every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Organic, well designed, effective, advertised accurately. Thanks for an awesome product. Highly reccomended, as a dietary supplement, skin product, or whatever</li>
    <li> love this product. My skin welcomed the moisture that the emu oil gave. The price can&#x27;t be beat. I will continue to order this product!!</li>
    <li> thank you, just as promised</li>
    <li> recently started using this product, so, no comment</li>
    <li> These two bottles lasted me about six months, so they come out to about $7 per month.  The oil does absorb quickly and you only need to use a dab instead of lathering on other products.  I&#x27;m not sure how much they&#x27;ve reduced wrinkles.  At the same time, I do feel my skin reacts better (less itchiness) using this than pure vitamin E oil after swimming in the pool.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also use it on some new and old scars and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the emu oil or the rubbing (i.e., stimulating blood circulation) that made the new scar heal quickly.  The old scar is still there.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve moved on to using a different/cheaper brand (supposedly triple-processed and organic) and after 1 day of use, feel like the other oil is slightly thicker.</li>
    <li> Used this during radiation and found it to be soothing.</li>
    <li> My second purchase of this two-pack of Emu oil, and both times I was very pleased with both the product and this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this oil after reading a book about controlling diabetes by Richard Bernstein, M.D. In said book Dr. Bernstein recommended that a diabetic (which he has been since the 1940s) rub mink oil into the feet everyday, to keep the skin supple and so avoid some of the complications diabetics can suffer to their feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: I could not find mink oil. However, at one specialty store the owner said that Emu oil was very similar. Hence, I started using emu oil, which I found worked wonderfully well. I then found the set of two sold here on Amazon, and have used the oil on a consistent basis for two years now. The skin of my feet, which had been very dry and prone to cracking, have been excellent since I started using emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also add what another reviewer noted: a dab rubbed into your hair will keep your hair from feeling dried out and blowing about, all without any greasy feel. Just a dab into your hands, rub them together, then run your hands through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this two-pack of emu oil will last a long time; in my case, two years. Just a dab will do ya (as the old ad used to say).</li>
    <li> have used successfully to protect skin and to combat redness from allergic reactions to food and environmental factors. very emollient - a little goes a long way. good protection and soothing relief. helps reduce redness. i am very sensitive to odors/fragrances and detect only a slight odor when applied on face.</li>
    <li> Very good product well priced</li>
    <li> Thought I would try on dry skin where nothing else had worked. Within a week I have noticed an improvement. Even if the dryness is healed I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Trying it for joint pain</li>
    <li> This is an excellent oil.  It is very rich and easily absorbed.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and found this a better moisturizer. It absorbs well and very quick, I feel my skin is softer, fresher and clear after using it.</li>
    <li> My skin seems to breakout after every/ any facial moisturizer . I tried them all!!!! I discovered the emu oil while doing research for hair oils and realized it is being used not only for hair but also for body aches, healing scars, age spots etc.. So I gave it a try as a facial moisturizer and it worked!! No breakouts!! And it&#x27;s healing my acne scars and fading sun damage spots!! And its been only 4 days since i started using it. Absolutely love it. I use it in the morning and at night. The bottle is small but all you need is a tiny pea size drop to cover the entire face. So one bottle comes out much cheaper than my Josie Maran Argan oil or  Estée Lauder, Clinique , Clarins moisturizers I used to buy.. I highly recommend it to everyone!!! Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> When it comes to skin care I use a few products but I consistently buy this one for my dry skin. I also appreciate the way they box the product so that it arrives here safely.</li>
    <li> If you get heat rashes or other skin rashes, this is a miracle solution. I have never found any cream or lotion that works as well as this.</li>
    <li> This was a great value package and the price was good too. I use it for my new Tattoo which is keeping it beautiful. I read that Emu Oil is better to use than lotions for healing and to maintain the color of Tattoo&#x27;s. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product has cleared up not only my skin, my son who has eczema his skin has really become smoother and has cleared! This is my second time ordering this product. With summer coming up its good on the skin!</li>
