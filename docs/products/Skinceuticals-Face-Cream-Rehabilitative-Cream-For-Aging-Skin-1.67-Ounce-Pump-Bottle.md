    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few of the Skinceuticals products, but I have to say I think that this one is my favorite and would purchase again.  It&#x27;s a thick cream in a heavy glass pump bottle. It softens my skin and has not caused any break outs or milia.  It really sinks into your skin and there is no offensive odor.  It is expensive, but it seems to make a difference.  Thankfully, Amazon has a better price on it then most places where you can buy it.</li>
    <li> After trying many different skin creams for my dry and aging skin, this is the first one that has made a visible difference. My skin looks softer and moister, and just fresher in some subtle way.</li>
    <li> I really love this cream.  The thing that sets this cream apart from other creams is that you can feel all of it penetrates into your skin and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of your skin like other moisturizers.  I live in CA where the weather is a bit on the dry side, and I am in my 30&#x27;s and I use this even though it says it is for mature skin.  I don&#x27;t feel it is too greasy at all, since all of it penetrates into the skin.  I was buying if from my dermatologist&#x27;s office for around $135/bottle until I found it on Amazon for alot cheaper!</li>
    <li> Great product keep your skin supple</li>
    <li> Perfect wieght, best face cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate and I dont like a heavy face cream. It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will actually do anything for my face but I do love the texture, smell and overall product.  I will continue to use this as my day cream.</li>
    <li> Great product - a little goes a long way.  Lasts for about 5-6 months.  Makes my skin feel and look great.  My skin is a little sensitive and this product does not bother it at all.</li>
    <li> When I got the box the seal was broken and there was product in pump of the bottle. It had obviously been used. It smelled really bad so I don&#x27;t know if it was old or what. I won&#x27;t buy it again and won&#x27;t buy anymore products from this distributor.</li>
    <li> after over 3 weeks of using it I gave up. It didn&#x27;t do anything to my face. I bought Amatokin Emulsion 4 days  ago and this is by far the best product i have ever put on my skin.  Its like a miracle.</li>
    <li> I am in my forties and I still have combination skin but this cream is great it gives the hydration I need and but it is nit greasy. I love skinceuticals</li>
    <li> This did not do anything for my face. Did not like the consistency nor how it sat on my skin. May work differently on other&#x27;s skin perhaps, but I would not recommend. However, it is made with decent ingredients...so there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> I love this - not sure it makes me more beautiful, but it goes on nicely, not sticky at all.  Smooth under make-up too.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It not only helped with my wrinkles, it also helped clear up most of my acne.  My face feels smooth to the touch and my wrinkles get fainter by the day.  Some of them are completely gone.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you try this product.  It is 100% worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this skin cream-recommended by my dermatologist !!  It really works and my skin is soft and moist.  I use it morning and night  and have seen great results since using it.  It is not greasy and is absorbed by my skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Love love the feel and texture of this cream. I was expecting this to be heavy, but it is just perfect.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended by dermatologist. It sells in doctors&#x27; offices for a higher price.</li>
    <li> How horrible to send a customer a bottle that was already open!  I have been buying this product for years and the bottle comes sealed in it&#x27;s own package!  I do not recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used their products for years on my sensitive dry skin and this is another one that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Although this is expensive, to me it is worth it because I&#x27;ve yet to find any other product that works as well. My skin looks and feels younger, smoother, softer. I am so impressed that I will check out some of their other products.</li>
