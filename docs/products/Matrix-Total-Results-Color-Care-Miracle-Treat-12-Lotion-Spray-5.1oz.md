    <li> This is a nice product to use.  Have dry coarse blonde hair that is highlighted often looks like a frizz ball after blow drying, this helps alot for reducing the frizz without any after residue on hair.  Alough my hair still requires a little serum on ends even using this product I still think a good product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best leave in conditioners I have tried. It makes my hair feel silky soft. I love it! Just be aware that Matrix has changed the packaging for this product. The bottle is now all purple instead of a white bottle with a purple label. Same great product, just new packaging.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair product!   I would say to use sparingly bc it goes a long way.... Which is a good thing, making the price very economical!</li>
    <li> My beauty shop was out of this item, so I had to buy it here. It makes a mess if you try to spray it into your hair; slippery floors and spotted vanity top. Works best if you spray the product into your palm and press it into damp hair with both hands, starting on the tips and working toward your scalp.</li>
    <li> This lotion works fantastically on my thick, coarse, unmanageable hair. Leaves it soft and silky smooth. I have been looking for a product to replace my blow dry cr&amp;egrave;me that has been discontinued and this is it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! makes my hair so soft. I just spray on two or three pumps after a shower and my hair combs through so easy. I don&#x27;t get split ends like I used to and it has softened my dry ends without making my hair feel dirty.</li>
    <li> The price at the salon that I go to was much higher.  Thanks for a good deal and a great  product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got curly short hair. This holds and differentiates my curls some, which is what I like. Introduced to me by hair stylist who didn&#x27;t use it because it was a product for sale at the salon, but rather she&#x27;d used it for years and knew it was right for me. I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell of most hair products, this one is very non-obtrusive.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a 3 pack with shampoo, conditioner and the miracle treat which was supposed to be a 5 oz and I received a 1 oz. Amazon  is the one who fixed it. I love this stuff and I love amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I was introduced to it by my beautician.  I used it after my new perm and it made my hair feel soft and bouncy.</li>
    <li> Have reordered this product.  It works.</li>
    <li> I guess i was expecting something better than this. It didn&#x27;t make much of a difference. My hair still gets tangled even when i use this lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years after my hairdresser used it on my hair. It makes my hair super soft. Sometimes conditioner is too heavy for my oily hair but this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I like it.  My hair is chemically treated and I wear it curly.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to keep my hair feeling conditioned.  I usually use it with a very small amount of gel.</li>
    <li> Great leave in conditioner. I use the Matrix a total results color care shampoo and conditioner and use this as one of my leave in conditioners. It is a thick lotion rather than a liquid spray. I don&#x27;t use it every time as I use other leave in conditioners. It makes hair super soft and less frizzy. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for frizzy hair....it pretty much defies humidity and unruly curls. They go the way I want them to....not the way my natural curls want.</li>
    <li> I use this everytime I wash my hair and it leaves the hair soft and easily managed as well as helps hold in the moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this. Leaves my hair feeling extra soft without weighing it down. I have just past my shoulder length hair and spray this 4 times in my hands to work it through my hair vs spray it on. Works perfect every time.</li>
    <li> The product has transformed my straw dry hair into thick, shiny and full hair. I get highlights about every 8 weeks and this really helps put the moisture and thickness back into my hair.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than&lt;br /&gt;My haurdressers price and the same.</li>
    <li> I have used it about twice now and so far I like the results.  Blow drying goes much easier with using this product.  One suggestion though, I would be careful about spraying too much on.  The first time my hair felt weighted down instead of flowing after blowing drying.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
