      <li>and it tangles easily when it&#x27;s not pulled back into a braid or piled on my head.</li>
      <li>An amount smaller than a dime is plenty for my medium length baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>It is much like a lubricant when you comb your hair, but it does not leave a greasy appearance.  </li>

      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>So far so good, it&#x27;s got less frizz and seems to actually be healthier, and I&#x27;ve noticed my split ends seem to be \\&quot;mending\\&quot; themselves!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is a standard in my daily routine. It controls frizz, adds shine, brings my hair back to life even with regular color applications. I have been using it for years and along that path have tried other, newer products and none has ever done a better job! Soft, silky, shiny hair...makes a woman feel good! (no matter what age and I am no longer young!)</li>
    <li> This product is great, but I am always disappointed when half of it leaks out. It was ordered for Christmas and shipped to 5 different family members. Unfortunately, four out of 5 were missing half of the product and the bags were full of it.</li>
    <li> I bought three different anti-frizz products for my thin, curly hair that (before a few days of using this product!) was frustratingly frizzy, no matter if it was humid out or extremely dry.  This is the only one that&#x27;s worked without making my hair looked weighed-down or greasy.  The bottle is very big too, so it should last a while.  I squeeze a dime-size amount in my hands after towel-drying my hair and let it air dry overnight.  I wake up and my hair looks good enough to wear out.  It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who was in tears after her last perm due to the frizziness. Now she&#x27;s all smiles and actually asked me to review this product so other girls can benefit. It has a light consistency but it moisturizes your hair for a long time. It smells very good as well. Most importantly she reports that it concretely improved the texture and smoothness of her hair. This is not one of those leave-in conditioners that you can&#x27;t figure out if you used it or not. The shine and smoothness that it adds to your hair is noticeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years because it rocks! Makes hair smooth and shiny, helpful for taming the frizzies, and it has a pleasant fragrance. This was the first time I bought this product online, and the seller was great to work with. I will definately purchase from them in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I still love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I have fairly coarse hair and this product was recommended by my salon years ago.  I&#x27;ve used it every since.  It smooths my hair and helps keep it from flying all over the place ...keeps it healthy too and you use such a small amount (the size of a quarter) that it lasts forever.  So glad I was able to find it here.  It is no longer carried by a lot of retailers.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for frizzy hair. Use a dime size amount and smooth into dry hair. Great for kids or adults. This bottle will last 6 to 8 months (and that&#x27;s including myself and daughter to use it everyday.)</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for years and I don&#x27;t want to use anything else. I have lots of light, thin, wavy hair that needs a smoother that won&#x27;t weigh it down but still give it shine. This product works and smells great. It also protects my hair from the dryness of winter.</li>
    <li> Although I did not purchase this item through Amazon (another site was discontinuing it so they were less expensive), I did look at other reviews on Amazon before buying the product for the first time so I came back to leave a review. I was pleasantly surprised, as I&#x27;ve tried other stuff in the past and either it didn&#x27;t work (weighed my hair down)AND smelled funny or just smelled. I was hesitant as it&#x27;s an almost oily liquid that you distribute through your hair and I assumed it&#x27;d leave my hair heavy. As I have naturally wavy but fine hair, I didn&#x27;t want my hair to look weighed down or flat. I use this product as directed (after towel drying my hair) and then \\&quot;layer\\&quot; on other styling products when the hair is drier to add volume, then blow dry it straight. I&#x27;m surprised at how healthy my hair looks and feels after just a few days of using it.  So far so good, it&#x27;s got less frizz and seems to actually be healthier, and I&#x27;ve noticed my split ends seem to be \\&quot;mending\\&quot; themselves!  I will come to Amazon to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this product many years ago. For the last few years I have had a hard time finding it regularly stocked locally so I have tried many substitutes. Nothing else has been as good as Recovery Complex in leaving my very fine hair shiny and frizz free with amazing volume. I also notice every time I am able to find it and use it regularly for several weeks my hair becomes fuller because of the reduced breakage. The only problem I have had is occasionally using too much. An amount smaller than a dime is plenty for my medium length baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product I have been using it for 1o Years.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It detangles wet hair and gives a shine. Its not greasy.</li>
    <li> I used to always have split ends; since using Recover Complex I don&#x27;t!  It&#x27;s a great product - lightweight, no over-powering aroma, and you need just a dime size amount (I have longer than shoulder-length hair).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years for my coarse curly hair and it works great. love the price on amazon too.</li>
    <li> This item arrive packed very well.  I would purchase an item from this vendor again. As for the product itself, I have had this product before and really like it!</li>
    <li> Everything was great.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over 30 years. I can&#x27;t live without it. Works great for skin care after I shave. I have sensitive skin. I have tried to find another product that works like this, but without success. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and ahve been using it for YEARS!!!! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I never do my hair hair any more. I just put this in it and let it dry naturally and it looks good enough for me;)</li>
    <li> This product is great for my needs.  It help;s me to control my hairdo while it conditions it also. This is a reorder..</li>
    <li> I have been using Bain De Terre for over 10 years. My salon in Oregon first introduced it to me. Then when I moved to Hawaii I couldn&#x27;t find it any more so I began having it shipped to me. I have long blonde (long enough to sit on) hair and it tangles easily when it&#x27;s not pulled back into a braid or piled on my head. A couple drops on my finger tips, rubbed into the snarls, does the trick. I always put it on the ends of my long hair and the split ends seem to disappear. It seems to strengthen my hair and give it a lovely shine, never oily. I have also tried &#x27;many&#x27; other oil based or cream based hair products but none work as well as this. Nexus Humectress ultimate conditioner does wonders though too. I use them both, with wet or dry hair. Bain De Terre has Argan in it so I bought Argan oil to try. Argon alone is too heavy for my hair so I now use it as a nice skin oil after bathing ! I start to panic when my supply gets down to a half bottle even though it does last a long time using only a few drops at a time. It&#x27;s the best product ever.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products that actually tames my frizzy hair.  A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling that a lot of anti-frizz products have.</li>
    <li> Have used for years and now it&#x27;s a new formula that has removed any problem ingredients. Delivery was in 2 with Prime</li>
    <li> This product is not what it use to be, does not have the same consistency, need more to get the same condition than previous blend. It is OK will be looking for another product</li>
    <li> Excellent. My hair looks shinny and manageable. I did follow all manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. However, I did try to use it with dry hair and I like it. too.</li>
    <li> It does a great job at taming the frizz.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair that can get dried out easily.  This keeps the my curl because it doesn&#x27;t weight it down but makes my hair soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> You only need a few drops and it really gets out the frizz.  But doesn&#x27;t make the hair look greasy.  It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it.  Smell great.  So light and keeps my hair in great shape.</li>
    <li> feels great looks great</li>
    <li> Been using this for years because it is a great hair product.</li>
    <li> keeps frizz down but makes it look oily</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Bain de Terre Recovery Complex Anti Frizz Shine Serum about 25 years ago by a friend and have been using it daily since.  The 10.1 fluid ounce size is very economical and great for refilling the smaller size bottles for use during travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20 years and I don&#x27;t plan to switch!  It&#x27;s perfect for fine, easy to tangle hair.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for this so was delighted to find it and delighted it was as good as I remember.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this forever and LOVE it. It gives my hair the best shine and protects against frizz. I use it after towel drying with my Smooth Down Heat Glide to blow dry my hair first. Then do the same thing before flat ironing it. If it&#x27;s a humid day I&#x27;ll use a little alone after that, but usually don&#x27;t need to do that. I was very thick, course, long hair and need more than the average person I think. But it&#x27;s a top notch product.</li>
    <li> I Have tried brands from top salons that have told me I would be happy with their products, they not  were not honest.  So I kept up with search not washing&lt;br /&gt;my hair until I found Bain De Terre  once again..&lt;br /&gt;Good job  BAIN DE TERRE&lt;br /&gt;yours truly  Alice Maxwell</li>
    <li> So light &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> This serum works great on natural curly fine hair. I have been using it for years. It is not too oily or sticky like some serums. It does not make your hair look greasy/oily afterwards either. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Always loved this product.  So glad  to find it at a reasonable price.  Love, Love this product. Makes my treated hair soft, manageable and shiny.  Makes it so easy to comb out after washing!</li>
    <li> Love it helps keep my hair manageable!</li>
    <li> I was surprised with the size. The bottles I usually buy at the beauty store was smaller. I hope you continue to have it.</li>
    <li> Great purchase &amp; price!  Lasts over 1 yr</li>
    <li> Great product ice been using it for over 10 years</li>
    <li> Works great on long or short hair &amp; on men&#x27;s beards.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Bain De Terre Recovry Complex.  I have used it for over 30 years and think it&#x27;s a great product to project hair.  I have gray/white hair and it adds a shine that makes the hair appear very healthy.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair products.  I&#x27;m not totally&lt;br /&gt;nuts about it because I think they&#x27;ve reduced the amount&lt;br /&gt;of lanolin in it.  But it works.. lasts forever.. you only need&lt;br /&gt;a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Love this product for leave in for hair and after shower on skin. Would not be without it. Tried other products and they never live up to Bain de terre.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s one of the best products for your hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have used this product for several years and have always loved it.  It was nice to find it in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Package arrived intact within shipping parameters. Nothing wrong with item.</li>
    <li> Little on the heavy side for me unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;I need every ounce of volume I can get, and this product takes it away (bummer) somewhat. I loved the scent shame it doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still on the market for a frizz tamer that is lite weight /:</li>
    <li> My mother is a retire hairdresser and she introduced this product to me many years ago. It makes my hair much softer and less frizzy. You don&#x27;t have to use very much. It is getting harder to find this product locally, so I am glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find the bigger bottle of this product that I have used for years.  It is great for &amp;#34;unfrizzing&amp;#34; fragile hair that has been permed or just damaged from any reason.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over 20 years. As I get grey hair now..... I like to call it platinum, I use a few more drops to keep my hair tame and shiny. I have very fine and short hair and 4-6 drop does the trick. It adds luster without a fake shiny look. It seems to go INTO the hair rather than sit ON the hair as several products of this type do.  I&#x27;ve tried all the major ones but also come back to OLD FAITHFUL. I&#x27;m just thankful Bain De Terre has not changed the formula all these years. If it works, don&#x27;t mess with it.  Amazon is the best source for this product. buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it! great for ALL hair types.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement using this by itself. If used along with another leave-in product I see a small improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years when I had a perm. I learned it was a great product even without having a perm. The after shampoo leave in product does not leave my hair greasy and limp like conditioners that I have to rinse out. I love this product. It used to have spf in it too but I don&#x27;t see that anymore on the product label.</li>
    <li> Incredible product and it makes your hair look healthy and baby soft.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist introduced me to this product more than ten years ago, and I have used it regularly ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing your hair, put a small amount of the product (proportional to the amount of your hair) into your palm, and massage it into your hair while it is still wet.  It is much like a lubricant when you comb your hair, but it does not leave a greasy appearance.  After combing, your hair will be lightly set, but not as rigidly as a spray-on product.  If wind-blown or slept on several days after application, by slightly wetting your hair and re-combing it, your hair will set well again.  The product adds a natural shine to the hair, without an oily appearance.  If you brush your hair instead of combing it, results are unknown.  The first combing after application eliminates most tangles or snags.  My hair is relatively short, and thus the size of product in my palm will be about the same as a dime.</li>
