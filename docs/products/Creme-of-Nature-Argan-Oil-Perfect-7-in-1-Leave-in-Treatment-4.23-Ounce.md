<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really like the creme of nature argon line. This product leave my hair feeling like silk.</li>
    <li> My hair feels excellent after use this product.</li>
    <li> I used this directly on scalp after using synthetic dreds.  Great for keeping hair moist.</li>
    <li> I must say this is the best leave in treatment i had in a while. It is thick and creamy but it makes my hair feel sooo soft immediately after spraying it into my hair. It doesnt make your hair feel greasy, sticky or dry instead your hair feels soft, well moisturized with a great shine. I wish i had order the 3pack because i just got this one but I know it will be finish very soon..</li>
    <li> After a disappointing result from Shea Moisture I thought I was going to have to wash my hair (4a/b). I decided to give this a try and it not only totally revived my hair but it feel so soft and moisturized. I will be running to the store to buy another bottle. I also love the Argan Perfect Edge and Gloss &amp; Shine Mist.</li>
    <li> Excellet for damaged hair</li>
    <li> Like I said, Best. Leave-in spray. EVER. It&#x27;s cheaper online than in the hair supply store, and PERFECT for colored women like myself who want to go natural with their hair. I&#x27;ve never gone natural in my life until last year and it was difficult managing it, and this softens and conditions from root to tip and smells SO NICE. And when I straightened my hair for the winter (my hair is fragile and will fry easily), it protected my hair from flat ironing and smoothed it. I&#x27;ll never use any other leave-ins again. I&#x27;M HOOKED! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was from the alcohol or what but it made my hair feel really dry and made me scalp irritated and quite itchy. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving this in your hair for a long period of time at all.</li>
    <li> Creme of Nature 7-n-1 Leave in Treatment 4.23oz  This product is the best out there for long hair.  It has improved my split ends and protects my hair from the heat appliances.  It has a wonderful fragrance that is fresh and light.  The product was received before the estimated delivery date.  It was well packaged and arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> Excellent for relaxed hair of African American women...</li>
    <li> Best product ever! Leaves my hair silky smooth as if I went to the hair salon !</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. My hair always feels soft, thick, and stronger after each use. Smells great too. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that this is the first time in my life that i ever wrote a review on anything. I am a private person. If i like/love something, i keep it to myself. However, this oil na na na na! I couldn&#x27;t but give it the credit it deserve. All i can say is where was this leave in treatment when i tried to go natural the first time. I have tried everything you name it. Wow! Am speechless.I am very please i decided to buy this item. Prior to this oil, i had the most unmanageable hair ever. However, when i started using this oil just this last week my whole hair routine has change. my hair is moisturize, soft, manageable and less time consuming. This is my miracle product. i will continue to use this product for my 4c colored hair. Am hooked. Please do not stop making this oil because my journey to this oil was a long time coming.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Use it after my wash as a leave in and it softens the hair.  Smells great too. A good buy.</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair soft and has a nice smell</li>
    <li> OH YES, I TRY OTHER LEAVE IN TREATMENT BEFORE, VERY EXPENSIVES. BUT THIS ONE IS MORE CHEAPPER AND I HAVE A WONDERFUL RESULTS, LEAVING MY HAIR SO MANAGEABLE, WITHOUT FREEZE AND EASY TO COMB. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I also had a lot of breakage &amp; dryness.  My daughter reccommended this product &amp; I&#x27;m hooked.  I the breakage is little to known &amp; my hair looks &amp; feels glorious.  In addition,  the Edge Control is very good. Thanks again Creme of Nature.</li>
    <li> Good product but use it sparingly, as it does tend to weigh down your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves my hair so nice and Silky. It helps manage my hair after I wash it. I haVe very corse hard to manage hair(4c). Almost like 4D , if that was an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love finding products that works well with my hair. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative thing I can think of is that it&#x27;s hard to get the product out of the bottle. The bottle is not squeezable, and the pump doesn&#x27;t allow much product to come out.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome I have used it twice since I received it. It is doing what it promised to do my hair is much softer and manageable its still breaking a little but not as much. My hair was severely damaged due to coloring, relaxing and straightening with flat iron. But this product delivers!</li>
    <li> it is okay, the smell turns me off a bit</li>
    <li> I love this product and the price is better than buying from retailers in this area this area.. It really does what it says it does. Makes my hair very silky</li>
    <li> i use this for my weave that I have colored to keep it from drying out. It really moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I just love this line of products really work well with my hair type make my hair feel soft and silky .</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with fine hair, meaning I can&#x27;t use oily substances in my hair or they weigh it down too much and lately I had difficulties finding oils to meet my credentials for my hair. Then I saw this recommended to a lady of the same race in a beauty supply store and thought \\&quot;maybe I should try it. \\&quot; well, I&#x27;m very happy I did. The product didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, in fact it even makes it feel thicker and you could tell it was protecting my hair from my flat iron from the way the steam rose off of it. It even smells really great. I fully recommend it, Might even go back and buy the shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I really wanted something that would seal the moisture in my hair without making it feel greasy, so I gave this product a try. I LOVED it. As per the directions, I sprayed some on my towel-dried hair, then brushed it through. It gave me shine and made my hair wonderfully soft at the same time. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have breakage when I used it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again though, because there is practically nothing in this bottle. I finished it in a week, and I put water in the bottle to stretch it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has protein in it as well.</li>
    <li> Great  product hair was very moisturized the scent is amazing will be repurchasing  wish it were readily available on the ground</li>
    <li> Best after shower leave in conditioner!!! i have spent a ton of money on many products and this is my favorite!! not to mention cant beat the price!!!</li>
    <li> Good for hair.I wish I could buy more.Love the smell.Feels natural</li>
    <li> I love the scent and how soft it makes my hair. It&#x27;s a good detangler as well.</li>
    <li> great product, its easy to use after you wash your hair plus leaves it with a lovely long lasting smell :D</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product it keeps my hair soft moisturized and smelling good.</li>
    <li> I have issues with dandruff if my hair becomes too dry and I find some products will dry my hair out even though they are moisturizers.  This has been great for keeping my hair moisturized, soft and it dosn&#x27;t feel oily.  I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use it ever day and I&#x27;ll be checking out the other products in this line.</li>
    <li> My girls have very curly dry hair, and this stuff works the best of anything I have used to help add moisture, and allow for easier brushing. I put it on their wet hair after showering.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. It smells and feels amazing. I was having some really bad shedding and breakage with my hair and at my wits end when this guy who works at this beauty supply store convinced me to get it. So after the first use I noticed my hair felt really moisturized (not oily or greasy). After about three or four more uses I noticed that my shedding stopped. Its been almost two months now and I have no breakage or shedding and my hair still feels amazing and soft. Its even grown an inch. Regardless to say this is now my main staple.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair soft, shiny and silky. Improves texture immediately. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff its my staple product. I was hesitant to buy it because it was a little pricey. But after the 1st use I was addicted. When I buy it I buy 2 bottles to make sure I don&#x27;t run out of  it. My hair is natural and I was experiencing my hair staying dry, until I found this perfect 7 oil.</li>
    <li> excellent product, worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and does as it describes</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Creme of Nature products and I ran out to buy this from the store. It smells amazing and the reviews have been great. Sadly, it has alcohol in it and I can&#x27;t use products with alcohol on my hair - they make my scalp itch like crazy. If you have adverse reactions related to products with alcohol in them, you may want to avoid this.</li>
    <li> I have 4b/4c hair, and for anyone that has that hair type, you know how difficult it can be to moisturize and keep the dryness away! But this product does it for me every single time, I spray it on my hair when it&#x27;s damp and it&#x27;s moisturized for a couple of days (which is a miracle for me). The smell is so nice and I have no issues with it. I would recommend this product to anyone who has moisture issues!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many bottles I&#x27;ve gone through of this. I&#x27;m pretty sure this line of products is geared for textured/relaxed hair, but I am a white woman with long color-treated/heat damaged hair with plenty of breakage, and no leave-in does what this does for me. I have spent so much money throughout the years looking for a product that manages frizz and adds moisture to my fried hair, and nothing wowed me until I found this product. I will never use anything else. Better than any high-end treatment I&#x27;ve ever used by a long shot.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it great for moisture! Definitely will repurchase this item!</li>
    <li> Just like the first time I tried it. The bottle is awesome works well and soothes the frizz I still use conditioner with my hair but this is like the cherry on top. My sister introduced me to this product and I have been using it ever since. Awesome and smooth and you never have to use that much. Works like a charm when straightening.</li>
    <li> Great stuff moisturizing smells great and works well. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Omg this is the best leave in treatment ever, seriously I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that would detangle my hair for a long time I always was skeptical about this product in stores but im glad that I gave it a try. Finally got something that works, I was using Africa&#x27;s best instant detangler but it sucked really didn&#x27;t do what it says like this creme of nature product does. But I am planning on continue to be using this product even though I wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a very good product</li>
    <li> Purchased because of reviews on other curly head websites.  The product is ok.  It&#x27;s milky and my hair doesn&#x27;t soak it up well.  The size verses the cost is not worth it for me.  It does soften my hair, but my hair feels as if there is a light greasy residue on it.  I would use again as a standby if the price comes down.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and accurate product</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC!  Smells wonderful, feels soft and silky, and the comb runs through my long hair like a knife through warm butter.</li>
    <li> I love this product, a 7 in 1. I enjoy multipurpose products. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love how soft it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> Unexpected pleasant surprise as to how well this product worked on non ethnic hair. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It leaves my hair very soft and manageable. I would difinetly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this ishhh. Its good on natural hair use it 4 my daughter whi is 8 and natural</li>
    <li> NOT SOLELY ARGAN OIL... contains parable ..highly dissapointed</li>
    <li> I like this product but it&#x27;s too hard to spray please rethink packaging I Ave to pour in my hands to apply to my hair.</li>
    <li> When sprayed too heavily, it leaves the hair wet. But good for straightening hair. Style lasts longer than expected. Very satisfied with this product. Smells good too!!!!</li>
    <li> Left my natural curly hair so shiny and soft. Loved it! Will be repurchasing. A+</li>
    <li> This stuff works WONDERS on my hair ! I also like the other &amp;#34; Cream of Nature &amp;#34; products.(~_^)</li>
    <li> Amazing ! It Works Best When You Spray On Wet Or Damp Hair. Usually When I Blow Dry My Hair It Gets Really Thick And Is Hard To Strengthen But This Made My Hair Soft And More Easy To Strengthen. I Highly Recommend This Product, I Will Definitely Be Buying More</li>
