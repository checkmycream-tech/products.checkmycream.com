      <li>So easy to use and change out the refill.</li>
      <li>always have it available under the kitchen sink.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic.</li>
      <li>I initially wasn&#x27;t sure it would hold up and be a good value</li>
      <li>Not any refills  fit in original holder.</li>

      <li>I love the whole lysol system.</li>
      <li>This one has a light sent that also helps keep the bathroom and hands fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this -- it works great and the machine dispenses fine so far; if it breaks, we&#x27;ll just have to go back to the pump.  </li>
      <li>I also like the tangerine and berry scents, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the cucumber--</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this product but its a little costly.</li>
      <li>Everyone likes the clean fresh fragrant and soft moisturizing effect on their hands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay $3 for a nice-smelling refill, but $7?  </li>

      <li>Thanks,  Joe D&#x27;Amore</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe nobody has commented on this -- bought two machines and four refills at Costco in a package deal for a really reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Product arrived as ordered, and it was a fast shipment by Amazon.  </li>
      <li>poke a hole in the top of the bottle and refill it from a big jug of SoftSoap or Dial, then put some clear tape over the hole to keep the soap from drying out.</li>
      <li>My son was interested in washing his hands more often with less prodding.  </li>
      <li>Although a bit expensive, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>I purchase my first Lysol no touch dispensore from a local discount store</li>
      <li>All of the options, great product in this dirty everyone has SOMETHING time.</li>
      <li>Give some gentle pressure, the lid will open (It flew and landed in floor).     </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>(just don&#x27;t buy these individually, always buy in 4 packs and only buy the scents that are reasonably priced at the time, they always fluctuate and sometimes your favourite scent will be twice the price, just wait, you&#x27;ll find it again for the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; price).</li>
      <li>The scent if very unassuming and these refills last far longer than I expected.  </li>
      <li>They work fantastically well, but only last about a week in our frequent hand-washing, health-conscious household.  </li>
      <li>The soap is great but the dispenser to which this belongs puts out way too much soap without a button to adjust:( that makes for lots of dripping and wasted soap.</li>

    <li> Love this product. Great scent. Lathers nicely.</li>
    <li> I think that this hands free antibacterial wash is vital in today&#x27;s day. All of the options, great product in this dirty everyone has SOMETHING time. Stay well, this is a good way to do so, great seller.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe nobody has commented on this -- bought two machines and four refills at Costco in a package deal for a really reasonable price. They work fantastically well, but only last about a week in our frequent hand-washing, health-conscious household.  So I figured I&#x27;d get refills at Amazon -- but $7 each?  Don&#x27;t fall for this -- poke a hole in the top of the bottle and refill it from a big jug of SoftSoap or Dial, then put some clear tape over the hole to keep the soap from drying out. I&#x27;ve been doing this -- it works great and the machine dispenses fine so far; if it breaks, we&#x27;ll just have to go back to the pump.  I&#x27;m willing to pay $3 for a nice-smelling refill, but $7?  No way -- that&#x27;s $56/month!</li>
    <li> The Lysol hand soap is a big hit our company, we have placed dispensers in our restrooms and kitchen areas at the request of the employees.  Everyone likes the clean fresh fragrant and soft moisturizing effect on their hands. Here is Another \\&quot;Great\\&quot; addition to the family of Lysol products.     Thanks,  Joe D&#x27;Amore</li>
    <li> Very happy with this 4 pack. The hand soap is a quality product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as ordered, and it was a fast shipment by Amazon.  The product, the lysol hands free soap dispenser works great!  I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. The cost is not prohibitive and the increased sanitation from not touching the soap dispenser is priceless. (just don&#x27;t buy these individually, always buy in 4 packs and only buy the scents that are reasonably priced at the time, they always fluctuate and sometimes your favourite scent will be twice the price, just wait, you&#x27;ll find it again for the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; price).</li>
    <li> I love the whole lysol system. I run a daycare and these are perfect for the bathroom so that kids can wash their own hands without getting too much soap. This one has a light sent that also helps keep the bathroom and hands fresh smelling.</li>
    <li> Bought original soap dispenser and soap through Sam&#x27;s.  Sam&#x27;s quit carrying the soap [[ASIN:B0038FLU94 Lysol No-Touch Hand Soap Refill, 8.5 Fl Oz Soothing Cucumber Splash Scent, 4 Count]] so ordered it through Amazon at a sizeable price reduction.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, great product and price!!  Love Lysol No-Touch Hand Soap.  So easy to use and change out the refill.</li>
    <li> They are great for smell. They also fit perfectly in the Lysol container. Great product I would buy it again and will.</li>
    <li> I like this hand soap.  However, I&#x27;m not as fond of the cucumber splash scent as I am some of the others.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, very recommended!!!</li>
    <li> first I didn&#x27;t know that, second I ordered the wrong size.  the good news - the return was easy and the internet provides a great way to refill the bottle that comes with the original.  Silly making two sizes.</li>
    <li> I purchase my first Lysol no touch dispensore from a local discount store and I loved it but when I went back to the store to buy replacement hand soap refill there was not any to be found on the selves thank god for reliable Amazon</li>
    <li> I like the aloe scent the best. I also like the tangerine and berry scents, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the cucumber--I won&#x27;t buy that one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refills can be expensive for this--it&#x27;s best to find them on sale, if you can.</li>
    <li> Lysol soap is a winner. It also has a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> These work well for my Mother who is 96. However, I do get tired of buying dispensers. It seems that every time I order the soap refill, it is a different size. This is no fault of this merchant. It is meant to be feedback for the Lysol Company.</li>
    <li> Run a butter knife under the plastic lid (Don&#x27;t twist the butter knife). Give some gentle pressure, the lid will open (It flew and landed in floor).     Refill (dilute soap with water if soap is very thick) and snap the lid back.     Wrap a scotch tape around the lid once you fill with soap (scotch tape is precautionary step to avoid any spills through the lid-gap. Not necessary though).     Voila... re-filled in 50 cents vs 7 dollars. A dollar saved is a dollar earned :-)</li>
    <li> Love these hand cleaners!this is great! It allows me to use my iPad at a good distance from the plug.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand soap it&#x27;s a staple at my kitchen sink. I like getting 4 at a time always have it available under the kitchen sink. I have ordered this before &amp; will continue to. Always arrives on time &amp; well packed w extra plastic wrap incase of spill there has never been a leaky one or any spill.</li>
    <li> I loved the concept of no touch soap dispensing with kids in the house.  My son was interested in washing his hands more often with less prodding.  The soap is great but the dispenser to which this belongs puts out way too much soap without a button to adjust:( that makes for lots of dripping and wasted soap. I prefer my simple human dispenser because you can adjust the output.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like everyone else, you check the cost of each item going into your basket.&lt;br /&gt;So what if you&#x27;re paying almost $4 for the replacement of the last swig of soap dispensed......&lt;br /&gt;Wht not buy in a cluster so you save the next trip to the store......delivered to your mailbox.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get much better does it and it saves you MONEY $$</li>
    <li> perfect method of getting these</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product but its a little costly. Buying in bulk got me a good price and a product I enjoy</li>
    <li> Lysol products do fulfill their advertising.  They certainly meet with our requirements.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. Only problem is that they change the holder size so you have to buy the current one. Not any refills  fit in original holder. Very disappointed in the sales tactic.</li>
    <li> Although a bit expensive, it is a great product. Cleans well and great smelling, I would recommend this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good product. have ordered two times and getting to order again</li>
    <li> I purchased the Lysol No-Touch for a break room at work.  The scent if very unassuming and these refills last far longer than I expected.  I initially wasn&#x27;t sure it would hold up and be a good value but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. In fact I had to push my subscription refill date back to 6 months so I wouldn&#x27;t get overstocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning though.  I initially screwed up and purchased the No-Touch KITCHEN system refill.  MAKE SURE WHICH SYSTEM YOU HAVE!  The KITCHEN system and HAND soap systems look similar but the refills are NOT interchangeable.  That said, Amazon was great and handled the replacement for me without any hassle.</li>
