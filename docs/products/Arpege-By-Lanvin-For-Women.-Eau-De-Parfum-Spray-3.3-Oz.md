      <li>and I&#x27;ve always loved it.</li>
      <li>she loved</li>
      <li>Easy to see why this is one of the great perfumes, why it has been in continuous production for almost 90 years:  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as sexy as I remember.</li>
      <li>Its my mom favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>A signature scent for me from many years ago.  </li>
      <li>I truly love Arpege, but it isn&#x27;t for the faint-hearted.</li>
      <li>It was inexpensive and quite lovely.</li>
      <li>This beauty has been through many reformulations but, unlike so many others(Maja and Tatiana come to mind), it has not been ruined.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Have to love Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>My mom bought this parfum many years ago</li>
      <li>so was glad to fined it and get it</li>
      <li>but my favorite fragrance for over 50 years.  </li>
      <li>This is the most foul smelling perfume.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>Not the original Lanvin Arpege formula.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear it to the office (opting for E&#x27;clat D&#x27;arpege instead), but it has become my go-to scent for any special occasion.</li>
      <li>Excellent buy, hard to find item.</li>
      <li>Many thanks.</li>
      <li>very old and very nice soft scent</li>
      <li>Rose, jasmine, and ylang-ylang make up the middle and are warmed with a bit of spice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has an aldehydic top, reminiscent of Chanel nO 5, but is much warmer due to the rich florals that come  through the aldehydes--it&#x27;s almost as if it segues into Joy for a while.  </li>
      <li>just right</li>
      <li>From the top and middle notes, I expected something more interesting in the drydown.</li>
      <li>I bought it because of the way it smelled on a girlfriend --rich , mysterious, French, worldly and sophisticated.</li>
      <li>Long lasting and a good buy.</li>
      <li>I would certainly buy it again because my wife vouches for it..</li>
      <li>It took forever to figure out how to discuss my issue with a person (liquids unreturnable); however when I did reach a representive, she was very helpful in negotiating a refund.</li>
      <li>A classicfragrance and reasonably priced under the circumstances..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s considered old fashion by many because it&#x27;s been around for so long, but it</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this perfume...</li>
      <li>Classy, classic, and a bit of perfume history.</li>
      <li>This return transaction was handled in a very professional manner.</li>
      <li>My mother was always a classy woman and this was her signature scent during the 60s.</li>
      <li>Soft and powdery.</li>
      <li>The base, after some nice vetiver and more spiciness settles into a soapy peach.  </li>
      <li>..will order again in the near future</li>
      <li>Not to strong not to weak</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My mom bought this parfum many years ago and I&#x27;ve always loved it. Then Lanvin discontinued it and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere...Have to love Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> The perfume was excellent...was sent in a timely manner.packaging was great..price was affordable..we cannot get this  area so was glad to fined it and get it..will order again in the near future</li>
    <li> A classicfragrance and reasonably priced under the circumstances.. I would certainly buy it again because my wife vouches for it..</li>
    <li> Apparently the scent in the black and clear bottles is the same, however I think the black bottle is prettier. The scent was reformulated in the 1990&#x27;s, which is probably the reason why customers say it doesn&#x27;t smell the way they remember.&lt;br /&gt;It has an aldehydic top, reminiscent of Chanel nO 5, but is much warmer due to the rich florals that come  through the aldehydes--it&#x27;s almost as if it segues into Joy for a while.  Rose, jasmine, and ylang-ylang make up the middle and are warmed with a bit of spice. So far so good. The base, after some nice vetiver and more spiciness settles into a soapy peach.  From the top and middle notes, I expected something more interesting in the drydown. At any rate, that is how it smelled on me. I bought it because of the way it smelled on a girlfriend --rich , mysterious, French, worldly and sophisticated. I suppose it all depends on one&#x27;s body chemistry, sigh. Long lasting and a good buy.</li>
    <li> A signature scent for me from many years ago.  Beautiful.  If any reformulating was done it hasn&#x27;t hurt it, at least for me.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a family member.</li>
    <li> Devine fragrance. Soft and powdery. Same as I remember it from back in the day.</li>
    <li> Arpege is the most beautiful scent!  It&#x27;s considered old fashion by many because it&#x27;s been around for so long, but it you&#x27;ve not familiar with it, rush out and try it!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume spray for my wife who has been looking for Arpege for a long time now.  However, the formulation had been changed by Lanvin a number of years ago and the scent is now noticeably different. My wife pointed this out as did several women in their on-line reviews. I consequently had to return the perfume to the vendor. This return transaction was handled in a very professional manner.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> I have been with arpege for over thirty years.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I wore this in college but remember the scent differently than what it is.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to update my scent memories.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy, hard to find item.</li>
    <li> gift for mom she loved it thank you</li>
    <li> Received all in great shape.  Many thanks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as sexy as I remember. Do you have &amp;#34;My Sin&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> very old and very nice soft scent</li>
    <li> Easy to see why this is one of the great perfumes, why it has been in continuous production for almost 90 years:  it simply smells great.  This beauty has been through many reformulations but, unlike so many others(Maja and Tatiana come to mind), it has not been ruined.  Still dominated by one of the best jasmine notes in perfume history.  Classy, classic, and a bit of perfume history.</li>
    <li> Not good. Scent is different than Apege from France.  Further, package was&lt;br /&gt;not in a bottle but a lipstick like carrier. Purchase was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Its my mom favorite perfume. The smell brings childhood memories. Best gift to my mom and Granda. Excellent service and Price.</li>
    <li> Great service product is what my mom wanted.</li>
    <li> This product is very very very very nice! I highly recommend this perfume...Not to strong not to weak just right... love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it.  It was inexpensive and quite lovely.</li>
    <li> My mother was always a classy woman and this was her signature scent during the 60s. I truly love Arpege, but it isn&#x27;t for the faint-hearted. It&#x27;s pungent and it lasts quite a long time. I don&#x27;t wear it to the office (opting for E&#x27;clat D&#x27;arpege instead), but it has become my go-to scent for any special occasion.</li>
    <li> This is the most foul smelling perfume. Not the original Lanvin Arpege formula. Moreover, you are not allowed to return it. Buyer Beware. Do not purchase. It took forever to figure out how to discuss my issue with a person (liquids unreturnable); however when I did reach a representive, she was very helpful in negotiating a refund.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores in US but my favorite fragrance for over 50 years.  Love it.</li>
