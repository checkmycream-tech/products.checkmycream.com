<li> The look is great, but the blue feather is too stiff, it doesn&#x27;t flow and look &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and when I put them in alcohol the blue that touched the alcohol bled :(</li>
<li> but when I bought them and they arrived they were just too long for me.  </li>
<li> Not too long, short, wide, or small.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m a male who has poor fashion taste.  </li>
<li> The feathers fell off of three earrings, I guess at least I got something.</li>
<li> Not impressed!</li>

    <li> I really liked the look of these earrings but when I bought them and they arrived they were just too long for me.  My daughter in law loves things like this and I gave them to her as a gift. She loves them. I do wish they had not been to long  because they are beautiful and I&#x27;m actually thinking that this will also be my next tattoo lol</li>
    <li> I ordered earrings for my daughter from here and these earrings were sent but they were not what I ordered. As far as the color and type I just got about five pairs of earrings put into a box and sent to me. Never got the correct color. They were pretty as long as I got a pair to be the same color and feathers together to make one pair! The feathers fell off of three earrings, I guess at least I got something. If I am getting a refund then I have yet to see it put BACK into my acct? Took it fast enuf! Thank you. Amazon does better at giving me what I ordered when I stay inside of amazon gaurs teed items!</li>
    <li> They were just as adverised, perfect, just what I was looking for.  I will order more in othere colors. I am very happy</li>
    <li> The look is great, but the blue feather is too stiff, it doesn&#x27;t flow and look &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and when I put them in alcohol the blue that touched the alcohol bled :(</li>
    <li> Came within a timely manner but did not look like the picture but my niece was pleased with them dispute it so it was okay.</li>
    <li> I bought my girlfriend a pair of these. She likes them. She has worn them several times. They look cool to me but I&#x27;m a male who has poor fashion taste.  :)</li>
    <li> While feathers are delicate of course, this set is worth way more than the price we paid for it based on looks alone. For $5.98 a pair my Navajo wife and in-laws want to order several pairs. I purchased a blue tone pair for my wife. You DO NOT get all the colored pairs for this price, just one pair, one color. The colors are all sold separately. These earrings ARE very fashionable and desirable for native/southwestern/chic style. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I get tons of compliments everytime I wear them. I have purchased more garments with these colors just so I can wear these earrings.</li>
    <li> So many feather earrings are scraggly looking. These are perfect feathers and the added leather and beads make them so fabulously 70&#x27;s!!!</li>
    <li> I bought for my wife and I thought it was more than one according to the picture but it was only one....I should read the desc and they should change it to one  per pic!</li>
    <li> I got alot of comments when I wear around because it has different design. Also the feature has some influence Native American style.</li>
    <li> Bought these earrings for my young niece for Christmas.  She loved them!  Very nice quality and looked exactly like the picture. Would definitely buy from Luos again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get what was in the picture...I got 1 pair of earrings that were beautiful but then got another pair that were NOT what I ordered and also a hair piece that I NEVER ordered....Not impressed!</li>
    <li> The first time I wore these for a work day I came home to discover that the beads had all fallen off one of the earrings!  One day of wear and they fall apart.</li>
    <li> i wore the earrings for the first time, even tho i didn&#x27;t know the feathers did&lt;br /&gt;not match.  i will be returning them for another pair.  they are cute earrings.&lt;br /&gt;the earrings fell apart. their blue with red and orange (only on one earrings)</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 16 year old niece and I hope she likes them.  I think she will.  She likes Indian things .  They are really pretty. I bought the blue ones, because thats her favorite color. I am really happy with them. I ordered them and had them in about 3 days, I was really surprised how fast I got them.</li>
    <li> I bought these earings as a gift for my mother. She is Native American and love&#x27;s feathers and beads. When I received them they were perfect! I wish I had got a pair for myself! My mother loved them! Thank u! Thank u! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Not too long, short, wide, or small. These earrings are beautiful and I&#x27;ve already gotten a few compliments on them.</li>
    <li> This product shows as 3 pair and one pair will be sent. The pair that arrived did arrive on time and in very good shape.  They are very pretty and I think the person I bought these for will really enjoy wearing them a lot.</li>
