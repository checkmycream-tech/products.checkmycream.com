      <li>I would recommend this product to all the men out there:)</li>
      <li>i love the smell</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance, but the container itself leaks the cologne on whatever surface I sit it on.  </li>
      <li>I am very familiar with this cologne.</li>
      <li>I first got this cologne from a friend before and loved the smell immediately</li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who wants a awesome cologne</li>
      <li>The design of the bottle is interesting though not the most comfortable to hold when using.</li>
      <li>Simply put...this cologne was an excellent fit for me.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cologne, it&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>I much rather buy this from amazon at a good price than pay macy&#x27;s or Dillards more than its worth!</li>
      <li>Easy handle.</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne now, use to be cool water.</li>
      <li>for the price was good, not bad smell but is not going to long on a sunny day just good</li>
      <li>Second time ordering this product, The first order was perfect.</li>
      <li>this is the best cologne ive smelled in a long time!its worth the purchase.when</li>
      <li>It smells like kerosene and it&#x27;s cheaply made and</li>
      <li>Nice gift set included the Eau De Toilette Spray plus the shower gel and deodorant stick which was a nice surprise as I thought I was getting only the the spray.</li>
      <li>amazing bottle and high quality</li>
      <li>I bought it for my husband and he love it very much.</li>

      <li>Arrived quick and packaged well.</li>
      <li>I like to overdue my colognes, like I&#x27;m talking, 10-12 sprays, which is normally fine due to the light citrus smells I normally wear, but with this one it smells good, but if you overdue it, people are going to start puking.</li>

      <li>SO, only do like two or three sprays, and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
      <li>Very fast i have.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, this and Gucci Guilty are the best colognes.</li>
      <li>At first I was like this smell isn&#x27;t going to work for me...</li>
      <li>I went to the store to smell it first</li>
      <li>I tested this in the local department stores but didn&#x27;t want to pay what they were asking; glad I waited to see how much it was on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I must admit though, it goes on strong but the scent does not hang around so you will have to reapply mid-day if you want the smell to last.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great, women love it!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a bit awkward though</li>
    <li> I had previously owned Rocawear 9 but never bought it again at Macy&#x27;s because I love to try new colognes so I would always end up taking something new to the house. The package arrived within two business days of when I placed the order. As soon as I got home I tore the box open and sprayed it on twice. After 15 minutes I could tell it was the same product I had purchased from Macy&#x27;s two years ago. The smell is great not too strong with a woodsy/citrus smell. I&#x27;ve only had it for two weeks and I&#x27;ve already gotten more compliments on it than the 9 months I had it two years ago. Every girl that&#x27;s gotten a whiff of it has loved it and you can use it for casual or formal wear. Very Nice !!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell  and for the price its well worth it</li>
    <li> Colonge smells. Amazing. Last really long&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was. Very fast i have. Ova 50 bottles. This is my. Fav. And amazon saved me money!!!</li>
    <li> I like to overdue my colognes, like I&#x27;m talking, 10-12 sprays, which is normally fine due to the light citrus smells I normally wear, but with this one it smells good, but if you overdue it, people are going to start puking. Haha. SO, only do like two or three sprays, and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
    <li> Simply put...this cologne was an excellent fit for me.  It is the right blend of spices and fragrance that creates a great earthy scent.  The ladies love it on me!</li>
    <li> I tested this in the local department stores but didn&#x27;t want to pay what they were asking; glad I waited to see how much it was on Amazon.  Love the fragrance and price!</li>
    <li> It stunk on me every time I used it. It smelled so bad I became self-conscious about my body odor and just threw the bottle in the trash in disgust because I was tired of smelling funky. Do not buy this. It smells like kerosene and it&#x27;s cheaply made and it&#x27;s reminiscent of the imitation colognes on sale at gas station convenience stores.</li>
    <li> At first I was like this smell isn&#x27;t going to work for me...then after I went out, it seemed like everyone was telling me I smelled good.</li>
    <li> The cologne bottle came only halfway full. I love the way it smells, but receiving a bottle with half of the amount makes this deal less impressive.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is one of my top five. Great anytime. Never overbearing. I would recommend this to anyone. Great as a gift as well</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorites!  It really makes me feel fresh &amp; last extremely long (smell). I literally have women asking me what are you wearing, I guess it did it&#x27;s job lol. But I would recommend this to anyone. 5stars</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and the price cant be beat. My favorite cologne now, use to be cool water. I would recommend to anyone. Wear it eveeveryday, GIANT BOTTLE!!&#x3D;great for the price!</li>
    <li> Love this scent, Arrived as promised, well packaged. Not over whelming just the right mix of spicy herbal blend. I have to say I have not received any negative feed back on this spray. Goood Stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Rocawear 9IX is a Citrusy-woody-musky concoction which is fairly pleasant.  I have tested this fragrance out numerous times but am just not feeling it enough to purchase it.  I have owned Rocawear X for awhile and totally dig that fragrance...they are completely different fragrances of course, but all things considered, X wins hands down over 9IX, especially in the drydown phase...</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and during the purchase I thought it was a much smaller bottle than what I actually received.  This bottle is HUGE and will last at least a year or two.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic - my wife really likes it.  Too bad they have discontinued this scent, buy it while you can!</li>
    <li> Excelent good and original product..</li>
    <li> still wearing this cologne bottle lasts a very long time! and ladies love the smell I&#x27;ll be buying more soon</li>
    <li> The items were as advertised</li>
    <li> The best rocawear scent by far! A very subtle spicy scent to it. They definitely outdid themselves on this one! Comparable to Armani code.</li>
    <li> Cool, sweet fragrance. Gud in shape. Easy handle. Great look. Everything is gud. Packing, shipping great. I love it and i like alot.</li>
    <li> for the price was good, not bad smell but is not going to long on a sunny day just good</li>
    <li> Amazon did a great job at replacing the bottle that I bought that wouldn&#x27;t spray... Also this cologne smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This an amazing scent from Rocawear. Very masculine scent for everyday working man and can also wear this for the nightlife. If you want a food cologne at a really good price then this is for you. I always get compliments when wearing this</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne yet, I reorder this over and over.  I get a lot of people that complement it! An amazing buy!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne, it&#x27;s light but it actually work enough for me to receive comments on a regular basis. MUST BUY.</li>
    <li> good price for the size of bottle</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband as an anniversary gift. Nice gift set included the Eau De Toilette Spray plus the shower gel and deodorant stick which was a nice surprise as I thought I was getting only the the spray. The fragrance is really nice, has a touch of citrus and not over-powering. The only draw back, at least in my opinion,is that the fragrance is not long lasting. It is mild but I wish it lasted longer than half hour or so. Hence the four stars. The design of the bottle is interesting though not the most comfortable to hold when using. Love the shower gel! The deo stick has yet to be used.</li>
    <li> I previously enjoyed the Rocawear 9 IX cologne. The cologne was more expensive with a less amount.  The eau de toilette Rocawear is a close second and I have no worries the product will deliver many months of wear.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for marketing this product.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this product, The first order was perfect. Loved it. The second time I ordered it from a different seller.The product leaked from the bottom of the container. Had a rust color to it and smelled nothing like the Rocawear  9 IX. I had previously ordered.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell</li>
    <li> Definitely the real deal, no complaints</li>
    <li> I really like this cologne but it is hard to find in stores....I much rather buy this from amazon at a good price than pay macy&#x27;s or Dillards more than its worth!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and it smells great! I would recommend this item and the price was good too!</li>
    <li> my boyfriend loved it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for 3 years now and I love it! I&#x27;ve been asked several times... What is that cologne you are wearing?</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great period.</li>
    <li> good one long lasting smell and very nice packing . good spray for cheap cost .i would suggest this one for everyone (unisex)</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, but the container itself leaks the cologne on whatever surface I sit it on.  Never had this issue with a store bought container.  Would try it again.</li>
    <li> Personally I&#x27;d recommend that you buy cologne in stores but if you must buy some online, buy this scent.  This is by far the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I got compliments on it everywhere I went.  And on a side note, it&#x27;s not too big a deal if you drop it because the case is made of metal rather than glass.  In my opinion, this and Gucci Guilty are the best colognes.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing pretty good price for the amount you get! I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who wants a awesome cologne</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It was reasonably priced, has a lasting good smell and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the discounts on all products. When it comes to mens cologne. I go to my son for advice. He always smells good.</li>
    <li> amazing bottle and high quality</li>
    <li> Love this cologne it smells fresh and will last a long time and at this price you cant beat that! Fast shipping got here in a few days over all happy</li>
    <li> this is the best cologne ive smelled in a long time!its worth the purchase.when i was at the club,females were asking me what cologne i was wearing.nice smell</li>
    <li> I first got this cologne from a friend before and loved the smell immediately and now I got my own bottle and it is a huge bottle worth the price. It is the perfect gift for anyone man, or child</li>
    <li> Husband wears this as an everyday fragrance. This should last a long time.</li>
    <li> good smell and good price</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad because all he ever wants is cologne for Christmas. I went to the store to smell it first and it smells amazing!!! It smells clean, cool, fresh and light. The scent lasts and for this price you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> I am very familiar with this cologne. I&#x27;ve purchased it before, but since they don&#x27;t really sell the big bottles at stores anymore I bought it online through Amazon. The package came in time but when I opened it, I found the cologne leaking severely from the bottom. A good portion of the cologne was already gone and its continuing to leak! I am very disappointed by this. There&#x27;s no way I can return this or get a refund. I&#x27;m literally sitting here with a leaking cologne bottle!</li>
    <li> I think this smells great. It is a noticeable but not overpowering smell. I got this for meson and he likes it too.</li>
    <li> Best line of cologne yet, great size and style bottle. Would love if every man wore this cologne! Don&#x27;t hesitate on buying!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne on my husband!  It&#x27;s a large size and will last for some time.  One spritz will go a long way.  Arrived quick and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves this cologne so much that he begged me to get this again after losing it years ago.</li>
    <li> Is the best cologne will buy it anytime i run out</li>
    <li> This is my hubbys fave scent. I must admit though, it goes on strong but the scent does not hang around so you will have to reapply mid-day if you want the smell to last. This is a good sized bottle though, and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat. It&#x27;s hard to find near me, as it is no longer being sold in the stores</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and the bottle is huge,  will last my boyfriend a while!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years now. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this was ordered for a gift and was perfect for the person I ordered it for.  He loved it, and that it was a larger size.</li>
    <li> My son was very pleased!</li>
    <li> Very satisfy with this product. I bought it for my husband and he love it very much. I would recommend this product to all the men out there:) smell great.</li>
    <li> The spray bottle is way too big, its hard to hold and spray that&#x27;s my only complaint i love the smell</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells on my husband.</li>
    <li> Nice perfume with a little money</li>
