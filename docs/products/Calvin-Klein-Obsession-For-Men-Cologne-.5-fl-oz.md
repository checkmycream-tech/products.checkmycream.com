<li> There is something about Obsession for Men &amp; even the woman&#x27;s version that is so far removed from any other Scent.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
<li> The product was as described and I received it earlier than expected.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little to flowery scented for a male.</li>
<li> Just what I expected when I ordered.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve become obsessed with myself more so than usual with this product!</li>
<li> It is stupid that I have to use so many words to describe.  </li>
<li> I purchased this for my travel bad after NSA has thrown my baggage around so much that the larger bottle had opened and spilled all over my clothes the previous trip.</li>
<li> When I ordered it I expected it to be small</li>
<li> Since I travel, the little travel bottle works, throw it with my toilet articles, never leave it behind.</li>
<li> so i went small.</li>
<li> Got it for my dad a small bottle just heads up</li>
<li> but that is realllllllllly small</li>
<li> Have used Obsession for some years like it and wanted a small bottle for travel.</li>
<li> I had a hard time finding this small Obsession Travel size.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> But a moment later it smelled weird and cheap and terrible.  </li>
<li> I can hardly turn around from my reflection when this smell is added to my persona.</li>
<li> I have used this cologne for at least 20 years.  </li>
<li> This is a very small bottle .5 fl.</li>
<li> except i hate theses rating surveys</li>

    <li> There is something about Obsession for Men &amp; even the woman&#x27;s version that is so far removed from any other Scent.&lt;br /&gt;They got this scent right. I think their description could be more accurate.&lt;br /&gt;For 20 years I have worn this scent, it defines me.&lt;br /&gt;My description of this scent: Obsession for men has a mild Spice &amp; Cinnamon scent that has many dimensions that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;If pheromones had a scent we could identify it would smell like Obsession.</li>

    <li> This small and attractive spray bottle will last a long time despite its seemingly small capacity. Obsession for Men is a great classic fragrance, still going strong after all these years. Unobtrusive size for desk drawer or travel. Not refillable.</li>
