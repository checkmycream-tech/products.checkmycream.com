<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great toothbrush for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> These are not soft all.  I do not understand all the positive reviews touting how soft this toothbrush is?!  It&#x27;s a nice toothbrush, but it is no softer than any other \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush, and it is most certainly not \\&quot;Supersoft.\\&quot;  Buy the Nimbus if you want soft.</li>
    <li> I hope they continue to make these forever, because after nearly 40 years of searching, I finally found the perfect toothbrush. It cleans just fine but is also very gentle on the gums--great if you&#x27;re trying to avoid/curtail gum recession. I&#x27;ve tried other brushes with soft bristles and they didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> The brushes hold their shape and are very soft. I now use these exclusively, except for my powered swivel head toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I just received these toothbrushes last night.  I was thrilled with the results.  I used it with Revive toothpaste and what a difference!  I could actually feel the super-soft bristles cleaning in between my teeth.  The bristles are so soft, yet very effective.  I usually rush through my toothbrushing, but last night and this morning I actually spent extra time brushing because it felt so good.  My mouth feels like I just had a dental cleaning without the pain and discomfort.  I highly recommended this product!</li>
    <li> work great nice for cleaning the dogs teeth also works great on my teeth only problem toothpaste seems to stick inside the brush so you have to make double sure to rinse them off good that&#x27;s why the 4 stars</li>
    <li> Bristles are REALLY soft and easy on gums.</li>
    <li> The only toothbrush that&#x27;s actually soft AND effective. Every toothbrush claiming to be soft shreds my gums, these don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It is remarkably difficult to find really soft toothbrushes, whatever the packages say. But I have sensitive gums which really hurt after being abraded by stiff bristles. I was frankly sceptical that these brushes would be any better, but it was certainly worth trying. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. I am now able to brush much more vigorously, facilitating blood circulation, without damaging my gums, a huge advantage. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Nimbus brushes are much better.  These are not nearly as soft and pliable, and don&#x27;t seem to clean as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush! The bristles are very gentle on teeth and gums, yet still seem to clean thoroughly. And, these toothbrushes last about 2-3 times as long as the other extra-soft toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried. The handle isn&#x27;t as comfortable as I&#x27;d like, and it took a little getting used to, but I&#x27;m fine with it now. I&#x27;d have given this item 5 stars if the handle was more ergonomic.</li>
    <li> One of The Best Tooth brushes  i have ever used. worth the money trust me you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Dentist said I was brushing too hard, so these were recommended by him.  I thought they&#x27;d be too soft to really clean, but they&#x27;re surprisingly capable of getting my teeth clean.  The hygienist said I had less tartar than usual.  Yay.</li>
    <li> Love the super soft ones</li>
    <li> Most toothbrushes are too hard on the gums, causing a receding gumline.  My dentist told me to stop brushing so hard, so I went looking for a much softer toothbrush.  Most so-called \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried aren&#x27;t really soft, so I did an online search and came up with Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush.  I found it to be truly soft, and it feels like it&#x27;s doing a good job cleaning the teeth, as well.  I gave one to a guest to use and he commented on how great it felt and cleaned, without my saying anything about it.  Pricey, but so worth it.</li>
    <li> Our favorite toothbrush.  Have been using for several years now.  Soft but effective for cleaning; bristles hold up well.</li>
    <li> This is the only tooth brush I use now.  NO OTHER toothbrush is more gentle on your sensitive teeth, not ever Oral soft or super soft.  I buy these in bulk.  You will never go back to drug store toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Great brush albeit they do wear rather quickly. The ultra-thin bristles are wonderful on the gums and tight spaces.</li>
    <li> I am stuck on these toothbrushes - even knowing the importance of changing your brush and paste - I always has one of these stashed in a bathroom at home.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy some great Colgate Cool Max toothbrushes, since that&#x27;s what my new dentist gave me after my first visit. They were so soft and great compared to the generics I usually buy (and I never buy brand name anything if I can help it).&lt;br /&gt;However, while scanning the reviews I came across a mention of Dr. Collins Perio Supersoft Bristles. Since I was due for a periodontist visit for some horrible &amp;#34;crown-lengthening&amp;#34; procedure, I decided to try this unknown &amp;#34;perio supersoft&amp;#34; brush. I am SO GLAD I did!&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 6-pack and immediately gave one each to my husband and son. This toothbrush is WONDERFUL. So much softer than the Colgate brush I nearly purchased! I fully intend to keep buying this toothbrush from now on! Thanks a bunch Dr. Collins!</li>
    <li> Love these super soft toothbrushes.  My hygienist recommends a soft toothbrush.  Traditional &#x27;soft&#x27; toothbrushes (Oral B, Colgate, etc) aren&#x27;t really soft.  Trader Joe&#x27;s sells a good one but the nearest TJ&#x27;s is a 4 1/2 hr drive from where I live now.  The Dr Collins toothbrushes are tiny bit more expensive but they are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have always had a tendency to brush too hard and thus caused myself trouble with receding gums. I feel this toothbrush allows me to brush thoroughly but not as vigorously.</li>
    <li> Just buy these and try them out. I bet you will reorder. I give these away to friends and family and they always come back and ask for more!  Very easy on your gums. I go for teeth cleanings every 6 months. Since using these toothbrushes my plaque buildup has been noticeably less.</li>
    <li> The Period toothbrush may cost more than the store brands, but they leave your mouth clean and smooth.  They also last a long time.  The soft brush feels so good in the mouth.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery.  A bit pricey but love the toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> Sometime back I got put out with the dwindling selection of toothbrushes in local stores, so I ordered several different brands from Amazon to try out.  When I got to the Dr. Collins, my first thought was that it wouldn&#x27;t be very good because I thought the bristles were too narrow and wimpy.  Boy was I ever wrong.  These are the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve found so far, and I&#x27;m ordering more today.  Using this brush along with Desert Essence tea tree oil, mint flavored toothpaste makes my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve brushed with an electric toothbrush.  I had no idea you could get that from a manual toothbrush. Rinsing with dilute colloidal silver takes it even further.  Good score!</li>
    <li> Terrific product for anyone recovering from periodontal surgery. Removes plaque effectively. Bristles made of high quality materials and are long lasting. A bit expensive for toothbrushes, yes, but still a good value.</li>
    <li> Works great. Even seemed like it reduced the need to floss.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES these tooth brushes.  He got one by accident recently and liked it so much he had me order this multi pack for him.  He gave one to his mom.  I use an electric toothbrush - so I haven&#x27;t tried this one yet... but I will.  Per my husband: these are gentle on the gums and the bristle design feels almost like you&#x27;re brushing and flossing at the same time.</li>
    <li> Been using Perio for many years. It is the best soft toothbrush. The so called soft bristled brushes I get from my dentist are not soft. Perio changed my teeth for the better. Gums are now healthy and I know I am not hurting the enamel because the toothbrush is genuinely soft.</li>
    <li> The bristles are of very high quality as it is very fine and soft besides retaining its shape and not flowering. In fact, I am surprised with the excellent quality and wish it can be bought off the shelf in stores. Excellent value as it will be doing excellent brushing besides being durable.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever used. It feels like I&#x27;m brushing with a pillow. I can place as much pressure as I want without worrying about my gums.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush out there!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brushes that last a while, unlike many I&#x27;ve tried. And I haven&#x27;t had any cavities since using these brushes -- I used to have them all the time. I use these brushes and the Perio Wash mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Best manual toothbrushes I ever used.  My gums feel massaged and tingly and my teeth clean.  I&#x27;m hooked for life.  An electric toothbrush is best for cleaning.  But if you want to use a manual brush, this is it.</li>
    <li> Save your gums with these delicate and well-made brushes!</li>
    <li> Cleans well, very easy on sore mouths.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. I also recommend for those who wear braces.</li>
    <li> I can say enough good about these toothbrushes. Their tapered bristles leave my teeth as smooth as a trip to the dentist. I love Dr. Collins products!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush if you have super sensitive gums.  For some reason, my gums get scratched and sore if I use a regular &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrush that you can buy in the grocery store.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without the Perio toothbrush.  It is super soft and gentle on your gums but still somehow gets your teeth clean.  I don&#x27;t understand how it does it, but it does it.  And the tapered tips on the bristles sort of floss your teeth.  The first time I felt the sensation, the only word I could use to describe it was &amp;#34;revolutionary&amp;#34;.  It really is quite the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn NOT last longer than regular toothbrushes.  If anything the Perio brushes seem to wear out a little sooner than the regular ones.  But, that is not a major issue compared with the benefits I get from the Perio toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;If these brushes were commonly sold in stores like other well known toothbrush brands, nearly everyone would be using them.</li>
    <li> One look at the bristles and one can see why these bristles are superior to the more crude design of average toothbrush bristles. The first use confirmed all I had read previously about this toothbrush. I will never switch to another brand as long as these are the best around.</li>
    <li> We like this toothbrush very much, like the brush and the handle fits our holders. We always keep these on hand.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 6 pack of these after using a similar toothbrush that came in the kit provided by my orthodontist.  I really like the softness of the bristles, and it feels really nice when I brush.  My teeth and mouth feel cleaner and healthier.  I gave a couple of these to my dad and sister and they like these toothbrushes too.  These are definitely better and more comfortable than the regular nylon-bristle toothbrushes that I have used in the past.  I have since tried another brand of toothbrush (ABCOralCare) and am already missing my Dr Collins Perio!  Definitely  this is the only brand for me.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for kids and Spouses who don&#x27;t understand that brute strength isn&#x27;t a good thing for dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;Anything else is the toothbrush equivalent of a razor with seven blades.&lt;br /&gt;Useless unless you&#x27;re trying to shave a hirsute centipede.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the standard &#x27;soft&#x27; toothbrushes at the drug stores thinking this was the best I could do with my sensitive gums.  Then I found Dr. Collins toothbrush online and I buy no other kind now.  Truly gentle on my gums.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes.  The tapered and soft bristles are just what I need to get in between my teeth when brushing.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever.  Feels like silk, bristles are super soft and gentle on your teeth/gums.</li>
    <li> These are hands-down my favorite toothbrushes! The bristles are soft and leave my teeth feeling squeaky clean every time while gently massaging my gums. Get them as stocking stuffers for everyone in the family (my parents, adult brother &amp; sister-in-law, father-in-law...everyone!).</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use these. The are soft, but yet strong enough to leave teeth feeling clean. I would have given five stars, but colors are limited to similar dark colors.</li>
    <li> Our entire family switched to Dr. Collins Perio toothbrushes a while ago. Once you use them, you never go back to other regular toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used.  My husband loves it also.  I am ordering more for my son.</li>
    <li> Having suffered with bad gums for years I was told I was brushing too hard. I&#x27;ve bought every &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrush on the market and they all feel like knives. I found Dr Collins and have never bought anything else since.  It is fabulous!  If you want super soft get it. Everyone who visits (I order in bulk) and has used one immediately starts buying them.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d care enough to give a review about a toothbrush, but this one changed my mind on that.&lt;br /&gt;I never gave much attention to my toothbrush beyond getting a soft bristle. Well this one here changed my mind about how effective soft bristle brushes can be. A very soft feel to the gums and teeth, but after cleaning my teeth feel much cleaner than with store-bought soft bristle brands. The bristles are very soft, yet very durable. I&#x27;ve had mine about six months and it is still in great shape! The bristles aren&#x27;t laying bent over, but still straight. I&#x27;m so hooked I went ahead and bought 6 more to have ready in case the company goes out of business (not that I think it will)!&lt;br /&gt;And I have a couple of areas with receding gum lines - this brush doesn&#x27;t bother it a bit.</li>
    <li> Very soft - great toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> I like a toothbrush that knows what its doing. This brush knows its stuff, it feels natural. A true pro.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me I needed to use only extra soft toothbrushes. I checked Amazon &amp; these looked pretty good &amp; the price seemed reasonable. So far, so good. They are definitely soft, ergonomic, and are holding up very well.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth or gums it is a live saver. It is so gentle and works great. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Looks too old school to be effective but that isn&#x27;t the case. As good as they say! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I gave it as gift and my sister loves it so I bought more for her&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does a clean job !</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive gums these are just wonderful. And they clean well.  I won&#x27;t use anything else now.  WOW!</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are great. I am a vigorous brusher. With these I can brush vigorously and not irritate my gums. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a traditional toothbrush with soft bristles. I found this on Amazon and ordered the six pack because it made the most financial sense. I am very happy with this product..very soft bristles and a comfortable handle.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes and it was a great deal.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I hoped it would be. Best toothbrush I have ever owned and I&#x27;m being sincere. The ultra soft has definitely made improvements with my receding gum line, plus I have six of them and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to try these for a perio problem.  They worked for me with baking side &amp; peroxide when other treatments did not.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for quite a while.  I am very satisfied with them and the &amp;#34;job&amp;#34; they do on my teeth.  I find traditional brushes to be less user friendly:  they seem to be either too hard or too soft, and the shape never seems satisfactory.  These brushes have been the only ones that I have been truly happy with.  They are a little more expensive than many over-the-counter brushes but I believe they are worth the small extra cost.  My dentist is satisfied with the condition of my teeth and so am I. I would recommend others who are unhappy with traditional brushes try this product.  Shipping is always prompt and the product is always packaged well.</li>
    <li> excellent soft toothbrushe</li>
    <li> I think I have bought every soft or ultra soft toothbrush that has been manufactured over the last 30 years. This brush is, by far, the best I have ever used on my teeth. It is soft, it cleans well, it&#x27;s easy on the gums and it&#x27;s reasonably priced. I have never seen it sold over the counter (at least were I live). If you need a brush that won&#x27;t tear up you gums I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> a superior very soft tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;the older i get the better i appreciate this lovely brush.&lt;br /&gt;gentle but strong enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> Worth purchasing these. The soft bristles alone will not at first seem to be so much different from your normal &amp;#34;soft-bristle&amp;#34; grocery store tooth brushes. If you ever switch back after using these for a good while, you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference. Great brushes!</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are the best! I&#x27;ve always struggled with sensitive teeth and bleeding gums. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different toothbrush and toothpastes but none have helped like Dr. Collins. The bristles are so SOFT and my mouth feels super clean after brushing. I really love this toothbrush :-)</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes ever. They are soft and they clean your teeth and gums without making them bleed. We have a tendency of brushing too hard and this toothbrush prevents that and makes your mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> These are the only toothbrushes I use now as they scrape away not only the build-up on the front of the teeth well, but the kack of them too (unlike most of the other store brands).  I recommend changing it once a month to keep the effectiveness going.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was hard to get used to because I was accustomed to using something that was harder, but I really like it. I can tell that my teeth are not as sensitive and I think the bristles can get to the hard to reach places.  I will continue to purchase these.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat disappointed.  I ordered these based on the reviews that were posted, but having tried one, I can only say that I like the Perio Collis Curve toothbrush a lot better.  I&#x27;ll use the ones I bought for Christmas stocking stuffers and give somebody else a chance to try them.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush...delicate, small head , long lasting....highly recomend</li>
    <li> The best toothbrushes I have ever used.  Hands down.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush you can buy.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes ever.  Doesn&#x60;t hurt gums.  Dr. Collins makes the best toothbrushes and flosses.  I have electric toothbrushes, but, I always reach for this instead.</li>
    <li> Will never go back to regular tooth brushes.  These are so gentle on gums and tongue.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing the Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush on Amazon, I could not find a truly soft toothbrush that made my teeth feel clean. But this toothbrush does the trick. In addition to making my teeth feel really clean, the soft bristles have a way of gently  penetrating below the gum line to both clean the top of the roots and message the gums at the same time. The only complaint I have about this product is that after about three weeks of using the brush three to four times per day, the brush seems to lose its effectiveness. So this means that every couple of months I have to place an order for a new 6-pack, with Amazon, to keep myself and my wife well supplied.</li>
    <li> Only tooth brush brand I use now.</li>
    <li> I finally had to admit my old soft toothbrush was worn out.  I looked for a new toothbrush in all the local stores and was beginning to think they had forgotten how to make a SOFT toothbrush.  I tried two toothbrushes from Amazon and of course they all come in multiple packs.  Both claimed to be &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; but might have been excellent for scrubbing floors.  They were so harsh I had to start using a toothpaste that&#x27;s designed for sensitive teeth.  I finally discovered Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush.  I read the customer reviews.  I was still skeptical, as I had also seen good reviews on the previous two toothbrushes.  After using my Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush for several weeks, I&#x27;ve gone back to regular toothpaste.  Dr. Collins is also gentle enough to brush the back of the tongue.  No more sore mouth and I passed my annual checkup with flying colors.</li>
    <li> Too soft, cannot clean thoroughly</li>
    <li> These are the best toothbrushes I have ever found. They clean well without being abrasive. They give gums a good massage.They last at least as long as other toothbrushes. I brush three times every day and use color coding of the brush handles to let me know which brush to use (red for morning, blue or green for afternoon, and black for night. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love the deep down clean this toothbrush provides. Non irritating.</li>
    <li> I have been using a very soft brush, have found store brushes are brutal to my gums. My regular brand was unavailable and I found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial thoughts were these are a bit more stiff than I am used to and the handle could be better.&lt;br /&gt;Having had this brush for a week now, my thoughts are as follows: best brush head ever - allows full reach inside mouth, the bristles get between my teeth better than any other brush, and the handle is a non issue.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are gentle on my gums.  I would recommend them to anyone who deals with recession.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes. They are awesome on how they floss while you brush.</li>
    <li> They are thin bristles, and penetrate the teeth cavities well and clean well. But they wear out gradually.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and is easy on the gums as stated. I will continue to buy and use these.</li>
    <li> These are the only brushes I buy as I have been dealing with gum recession for 20 years.  Its impossible to find soft brushes like these in stores.</li>
    <li> This is the softest, yet effective, toothbrush that I have ever used.  When the major brands claim a toothbrush to be soft or extrasoft, they still pale in comparison to these.  My dentist always tries to give me toothbrushes when I have my teeth cleaned, but I simply refuse them, as they do no compare.</li>
    <li> Puts all other extra soft toothbrushes to shame! Truly, honestly, the best toothbrush I have ever owned. Not only are the bristles soft, but its also perfect size to get into tight spots. I will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> I am no longer using store bought toothbrushes since finding these brushes by Dr. Collins.  I have very weak enamel which was inherited and always tried to find the softest toothbrush in the stores, until I came across this toothbrush.  The bristles are ultra soft and on my last dental cleaning, the hygeinest told me that things had improved.  I will keep using these and also have the comfort in knowing that I am not harming my teeth from brushing too hard, which was a problem in the past.</li>
    <li> Love these toothbrushes!  Think I&#x27;ve converted the rest of the family so I&#x27;ve had to buy more and this was the best deal I found.  No problems and quick ship!</li>
    <li> Most dentists recommend soft bristles now. This toothbrush is most definitely the softest I have ever used. That said, it also gets the job done. I can&#x27;t comment yet on how long it will last, but I anticipate it lasting much longer than regular toothbrushes because of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I had gum restoration surgery and needed an ultra soft brush.  I have been using these for about a year now and see no reason to change.  You cannot buy this soft of a brush in the stores...at least none I have seen.  Turns out the reason for my receding gums was largely due to using too stiff of a brush in my younger years...wish I had started using these long ago.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t many products I describe as &amp;#34;wondahful.&amp;#34; This is one of them. I&#x27;ve hated brushing my teeth since I was a kid, and I still do, so it&#x27;s nice to have the most pleasant experience possible. Most soft toothbrushes at the drugstore or even from your dentist aren&#x27;t actually soft. This really is very, very soft. I don&#x27;t have to worry about brushing too hard. My dentist and particularly my hygienist seem very pleased. My gum margins were between 0-3 mm, which is very good, and I have not traditionally had the best dental health. I use this at the 45 degree angle that dentists tell you to use to try to get in between the tooth and gumline and it seems to work well for that.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used. Wish I could have discovered this earlier.</li>
    <li> These brushes are simply fantastic. I will be repurchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! My teeth look so much better. The bristles don&#x27;t come out in your mouth in clumps like regular toothbrushes. I&#x27;m so please with this product.</li>
    <li> Have bought these toothbrushes for over two years. Very soft on the gums.</li>
    <li> We love these toothbrushes. They hold up really well and are soft on the teeth and gums. I haven&#x27;t noticed any wear on them since I bought it months ago. Every so often I end up using my old one and it is a huge difference in how clean my mouth feels and how rough the experience is.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, best toothbrush I have ever used. Soft but firm and long lasting.</li>
    <li> The six-pack of assorted Dr. Collins Perio toothbrushes all come in one bag - not individually packaged.  I have had a habit for years of placing my toothbrush back into it&#x27;s opened package and putting it in my bathroom drawer.  Now however, I must purchase a toothbrush holder.  However, that is a small price to pay to have such an excellent toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have indicated, the bristles are extremely soft, and yet clean the teeth and between the teeth very well.  The bristles are not too harsh on the gum line and penetrate into narrow openings between teeth.  I had thought that because of just how soft the bristles are, they would not clean well.  This is simply not the case though.  They clean thoroughly.  Of course, you should always follow-up with flossing your teeth.  I believe this toothbrush will help reduce the gum receding and certainly will diminish/eliminate irritation of the gum line because of brushing.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Not toooo soft and with a head size good for an adult mouth. Also, the handle is comfortable and easy to grip. Buy &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I have gum recession and my dentist recommended an extra soft brush. I went to dentist.com or thereabout and ordered 10 different brushes. I tested the grip, brush softness, head size, longevity, etc. These are the BEST.</li>
    <li> I have thin gums and recently had a gum graft on all bottom teeth. I have been using these brushes for about 1 year and they have just the right amount of softness.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft but work very well.  I don&#x27;t have gum problems any more but I plan to use this toothbrush until all my teeth fall out.  Try it, you will like it.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s not recommended to use the same toothbrushes for more than 3 months, you could use this one for much longer without seeing any wear on the bristles.</li>
    <li> My dentist always gives out the softest tooth brushes and I have never been able to find any till now. Love these!!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite tooth brushes.  I have a heavy hand and I know I brush way too hard.  At least these super soft bristles keep me from &#x27;wearing my teeth down&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes since my son sent me some to try. I like them very much.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I use an extra-soft toothbrush.  These bristles are even softer than the standard extra soft toothbrushes I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  It&#x27;s almost like brushing my teeth with silk.  I will only use this brush from now on.</li>
    <li> The clean my teeth and do not irritate the gums, love them</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes in the world!</li>
    <li> Bristles are a bit tougher then what I expected. They don&#x27;t feel as soft on the teeth and gums as the Nimbus did. I bought a set of six so I&#x27;m going to have to take the hit.</li>
    <li> excellent is very soft toothbrush thank</li>
    <li> Best brushes I ever used.  Recommended by my dentist and it greatly lowered my visits to the diamond drill.  Cavities are a nightmare.</li>
    <li> I have always had &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; teeth. I would buy other soft brushes but once they became exposed to toothpaste, the bristles hardened. These toothbrushes stay soft from day one for their entire use. I give them to family and loved ones. Everyone loves them. My husband says it feels like the bristles floss his teeth and leave his mouth feeling like he just had his teeth cleaned at the dentist. The nicest part is they are very good for people suffering from cancer. The cancer treatments can cause their gums to bleed easily. I have a dear friend who is suffering from cancer and the Perio toothbrushes have helped her with this ordeal. I wished I had discovered them years ago. You will not be disappointed in your purchase!</li>
    <li> I recently had some oral surgery and I needed a soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;All the soft  toothbrushes I found in the stores were all very hard.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only toothbrush I have found that does my hurt to brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for having it instock.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are helping my teeth stay clean without abusing them</li>
    <li> These are exceptional toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush I have ever used, and I have tried all kinds of manual toothbrushes, and electric brushes such as Braun/Oral-B and Sonicare. I even had a few Rotadent brushes, which were great but terribly made. Anyway, this simple inexpensive manual brush cleans teeth, gums, gum lines, gum pockets, inter-dental gaps and anything else in the mouth so effectively, it is as if you had had a professional cleaning every time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I held back on reviewing the brush in case I was imagining it, but honestly I have never had such clean teeth and gums. Beside using it normally and gently like any toothbrush, you can also push it through your teeth and it does what you wish floss could do. It even slips under bridgework to clean that inaccessible space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculously good.</li>
    <li> Very gentle to the teeth and gums. Much softer than the normal &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrush available in the stores. They also seem to last longer than the toothbrushes available in local stores.</li>
    <li> The softest, most comfortable tooth brushes ever. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Soft and good. Recommend it. These brushes are definitely better than the ones I used before. Surprisingly soft yet cleans well.</li>
    <li> Good product! It is a pleasure to brush my teeth with a toothbrush that does not hurt my gums. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS TOOTHBRUSH A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND AM NOW HOOKED.  IT LAST FOREVER AND BRUSHES REALLY WELL.  YOU CAN FEEL A CLEAR DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU RUN YOUR TONGUE ACROSS YOU TEETH...IT FEELS ALMOST POLISHED.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My wife wanted them and they are very, very good.</li>
    <li> Perfect for resolving receding gums. Not so soft it doesn&#x27;t clean either and they do not wear any faster than other brushes</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes ever. Teeth get cleaner and stay cleaner longer with these. I also like the smaller head size for those of us that don&#x27;t have huge mouths.</li>
    <li> I love brushing my teeth with this product. Of all the toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used, this brand seems to clean my teeth the best.</li>
    <li> I have receding gums and I find this toothbrush very soft when brushing. The superfine bristles that are in there really reach into those hard to reach areas! Happy I purchased the 6 pack!</li>
    <li> I really, like this toothbrush. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes. First tried it when I purchased at a Health Store and it was on the pricey side. Went back to get some more and they were out and didn&#x27;t know when the shipment would arrived. Found on Amazon.com and the price was right. Six in a package, a real deal. Best part, love the feel of the soft bristles and how it massages the gums</li>
