      <li>Fast and easy, rinse with water.</li>
      <li>Great little gadget for getting those tricky nose hairs cut.</li>
      <li>Fresh batteries in, and still nothing.</li>
      <li>Very easy to us and very easy to fit in the wall medicine cabinet behind the mirror.</li>
      <li>First, let me say I&#x27;ve never used one of these devices before, so I don&#x27;t know how they are supposed to work.  </li>
      <li>This trimmer has the open ended design which works much better for me.</li>

      <li>I put in a brand new battery</li>
      <li>It tickles a little but easy to get use to.</li>

      <li>I read other reviews on these products before buying and still figured i could save on the cost but to help everyone else out and pass on the message, its worth spending a few more bucks and getting a name brand longer lasting product!</li>
      <li>and apparently it isn&#x27;t producing enough power to really cut anything with the nose trimmer attachment.</li>
      <li>From low price to high price, they just wouldn&#x27;t cut nose</li>
      <li>I have used Wahl trimmers for many years and they clearly have gotten worse over time.</li>
      <li>did not pull hair in my nose and also was able to cut them hairs with out leaving long ones behind</li>

<li> As a consequence it did a poor job of cutting my nose and ear hair.  </li>
<li> The brow attachment is useless.</li>
<li> Cutting performance</li>

    <li> I purchased this trimmer in February.  It never seemed to achieve a fast enough spin speed from the beginning, despite changing batteries, etc.  As a consequence it did a poor job of cutting my nose and ear hair.  It is now April, and it has died and will not work at all. I tried to send it back but it is too late.  I have used Wahl trimmers for many years and they clearly have gotten worse over time. But basically, it seems like it is a crap shoot when you buy one, wheter it&#x27;s expensive or cheap - some will work well and some are worthless. You never know until you get one. But if you don&#x27;t like it send it back quick and cut your losses.</li>

    <li> Great little gadget for getting those tricky nose hairs cut. It tickles a little but easy to get use to. It does not pull the hair as other brands tend to do.</li>
    <li> I got this for a very good price.It works well and doesn&#x27;t pull at the hairs. I would recommend it. Name brand so felt comfortable ordering it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 or 4 other trimmers before I came across this little gem. From low price to high price, they just wouldn&#x27;t cut nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the problem is with the rounded-tip design of other trimmers. Every one with this design just would not allow hair into the cutters. This trimmer has the open ended design which works much better for me. It&#x27;s the same design as my last trimmer which worked well (but dropped and broke).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool cuts thoroughly without pinching or pulling. It&#x27;s quiet with a good feel to it. Construction feels as if it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing which might be improved is the rotation speed of the blade. That said, the slow speed does not seem to affect it&#x27;s cutting performance so I won&#x27;t list it as a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Price&lt;br /&gt;- Head design&lt;br /&gt;- Cutting performance&lt;br /&gt;- No pinching/pulling&lt;br /&gt;- Single battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None that I can find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t tried the included eyebrow trimmer and fence attachment so I can&#x27;t comment on that</li>
    <li> Works better than expected. I would recommend this product. It not pinch or grab.  It took minimal effort to operate</li>
    <li> Works wonderful was purchased for my 93 year old daddy.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> The attachment is constantly falling off the unit. Do not buy this item because it is not worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> tickles my nose so much, my toes curl ... LOL ... Nice unit. only uses one AA battery. I would reccommend.</li>
    <li> Barely working - half broken about 2 weeks in . Poor construction, low reliability. I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> finally received it in the mail today and i was let down immediately. I put in a brand new battery and it wasn&#x27;t working. i finally unscrewed the top to see the tiny mechanism that was supposed to be turning the blade and apparently it isn&#x27;t producing enough power to really cut anything with the nose trimmer attachment. I read other reviews on these products before buying and still figured i could save on the cost but to help everyone else out and pass on the message, its worth spending a few more bucks and getting a name brand longer lasting product!</li>
    <li> Even with only occasional use, it lasted under a year. That&#x27;s somewhere between 5 and 12 uses. Also, you can&#x27;t get at the blade to clean it.</li>
    <li> This lasted about 2 months and then began overheating because of what seems to be a short. Melted internal plastic.</li>
    <li> I like the flat blade for nose hair. Works just like a hedge trimmer. Fast and easy, rinse with water.</li>
    <li> As expected, never had a bad &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> This ear and nose trimmer does the job most of the time, but the motor is not as fast as other ones I have used.  Also, the whole thing is on the bulky side, including the trimmer heads, so it&#x27;s difficult to get into tight places.  The brow attachment is useless.</li>
    <li> I found that I had an easy (if ticklish) time trimming my nose hairs. The eyebrow trimmer &#x27;guide&#x27; will trim WAY shorter than your brows should be. Maybe it is for men who want to groom around their brows without looking plucked, or maybe you are supposed to groom at a 90 degree angle from your face or at a distance or something. As I was tired when I first used it, I cut off a substantial portion of a brow before I noticed that I had done so. Luckily it was not so bad that I couldn&#x27;t pencil it in. I have a very cheap idiot proof drugstore trimmer that is able to trim my brows with zero thought, and I had assumed the guide would be as easy to use, but it just IS NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also beware when you pop out the brow guide from the package, it may fly across the room.</li>
    <li> I  was well leased.  It does a very nice job.</li>
    <li> Worked one time only.</li>
    <li> There are many brand of trimmer but this one its the best, Wahl has always accomplish great products and major quality so you can buy any Wahl produc with your ayes closed.</li>
    <li> good stuff, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband buy I use the nose trimmer too.  It works wonderful and I have never been knicked my it.  Very easy to us and very easy to fit in the wall medicine cabinet behind the mirror.</li>
    <li> BUY THIS FOR ME AND I LOVE IT. FEW DAYS AGO TO BUY ANOTHER FOR MY PARTNER</li>
    <li> New, out of package. Was a present for my husband, he was really excited to use it. Batteries in, and nothing. Fresh batteries in, and still nothing. Will be returning and going with a different brand.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes this items. Trimmer is small and good for traveling. Wahl is his favorite brand. I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very good. This product did what I expected it to do. I would recommend it to everyone that has use for it.</li>
