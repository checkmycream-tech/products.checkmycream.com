      <li>A haircut just as good as from the shop.  </li>
      <li>The wahl clippers cut almost as good as the tools I use in the shop.  </li>
      <li>It was a good pair of clippers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice &amp; handy family clipper.</li>
      <li>Very cheap, and they do a very nice job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Initially I was very pleased with it&#x27;s design, it&#x27;s use.</li>
      <li>I love them!</li>
      <li>The included comb / guides work great and made the cut easy.</li>
      <li>BR&gt;not great for people who are vain or who enjoy paying a ton at the barber/salon.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a nice pizza on Saturday night or a movie for two.</li>
      <li>nice piece of equipment to have at home.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really handy clipper.  </li>
      <li>Within an hour of receiving this kit I had watched the video and cut my own hair.  </li>
      <li>My son doesn&#x27;t mind me using it on him, I let him pretend to play Daddy&#x27;s X-Box while I&#x27;m doing it to get him to be kind of still.  </li>
      <li>Now, I don&#x27;t do any kind of fancy hairstyles, but rather whats called a \\&quot;Burr cut\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Nice carry case.</li>
      <li>The item arrived on time and new, the set is perfect using at home, this was a gift for my brother, but I&#x27;ve saved money &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t need to go to the barber shop.</li>
      <li>After my wife uses the Wahl clipper to cut my hair, I can&#x27;t believe many of my collegaues gave me compliment on how nice my hair look.</li>
      <li>Ok, so the Wahl brand is a good one in my mind, so I thought for sure I was safe purchasing this haircut kit even though it was the cheapest I could find on Amazon.</li>
      <li>it were good quality, too, and very useful.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
      <li>Instructions on paper were easy to follow (even if you don&#x27;t have a degree in engineering!)</li>
      <li>Easy to use and effective.</li>
      <li>It also came with full color directions on how to cut your own hair which was nice.</li>
      <li>But he was so pleased with the Wahl&#x27;s Clippers that he vowed that he would never go to a barber again.</li>
      <li>After many years of seeing these \\&quot;hairdressers\\&quot; effortlessly using their clippers, I decided I would try to do it myself.  </li>
      <li>I was soooo satisfied with this set that I ended up buying three of them.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair make it painless to cut kids hair that help you save more money.</li>
      <li>Also, my wife told me that I need to have a better hair cut for work.  </li>
      <li>For the price, if I use it twice it has more than paid for itself v. going to the children&#x27;s hair salon</li>
      <li>Make sure you test clippers before buying it</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what length I wanted</li>
      <li>I said \\&quot;Sure, why not.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I guess I was spoiled by the Wahl clippers I had owned for more than 20 years...</li>
      <li>Even you go to barber shop one time, it already cost you $15 or more.</li>
      <li>For the cost of slightly more than one month of haircuts, these Wahl clippers will give us years of haircuts for free!</li>
      <li>Also, the Wahl comes with many pieces and additions/attachments you can add to it or purchase from the Wahl site.</li>
      <li>I am 100% satisfied with this product and it has already earned me what I paid for.</li>
      <li>Do not buy that if you are contemplating between Wahl and Conair....make sure you buy the Wahl instead.</li>
      <li>Well, you&#x27;ll save yourself the cost of a haircut anyway! :)</li>
      <li>Has many hair length attachments.</li>
      <li>The clipper is great quality, is easy to use, and works very well.  </li>
      <li>The price is a good deal too if you buy from amazon, else one may perhaps ahve to wait for the Thanks giving sale!</li>
      <li>This Wahl clipper, on the other hand, is of superior quality for a great price.</li>
      <li>Because it was more than 30 days since I received the set, I returned in directly to Wahl, who VERY promptly sent me a replacement set that is perfect.</li>
      <li>Everything was included to make the task easy.</li>
      <li>easy to use and easy to store</li>
      <li>I order this and was delighted with its appearance, but it literall jerked my hairs out and was excruciating, even with a high pain tolerance.  </li>
      <li>My husband liked the result so much that he lets me cut his hair!</li>
      <li>10 years back I owned some clippers from Oster, I believe, and they were beautiful.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as some others, but works just fine</li>
      <li>Had it for a month now and seems to run fine.</li>
      <li>I can give myself a very good haircut (not great, but quite good) in about 5-10 minutes.</li>
      <li>I am able to trim my front portion of hair with this on my own, where as for a complete trim, I do need my wife&#x27;s assistance.</li>
      <li>The 20-minute how-to video which provided a crash course in haircutting techniques was most useful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure Wahl has something worth buying...</li>
      <li>My boys liked their haircuts so much, they told me they want me to cut their hair every time.  </li>
      <li>Keep it oiled and clean and it should be fine.</li>
      <li>The clipper often bit my hair (not cutting but biting!)</li>
      <li>So much better than the first time.</li>
      <li>I wanted to be able to cut my own hair, in a simple crew-cut fashion.  </li>
      <li>(We do it out on the terrace and that makes clean up even easier.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I let my wife \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my neck and around my ears).  </li>
      <li>with another model which has color comps, this one is totally ok and more complete in the accessories</li>
      <li>, well I won&#x27;t be using them, but the clipper did came with its hard-on carrying case and the model was the cheapest wahl that came with a taper control for a much clean cut.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an overall great kit with accessories that are suitable for a nearly professional cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared</li>
      <li>The first time i used these clippers, i thought they were kind of underpowered, and they would pull my hair and not cut very well.</li>
      <li>I would have been better buying a cheap pair at Walmart, which I normally do.</li>
      <li>they do is pull on the hair.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;It was true.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended--and a good new hobby to take up!</li>
      <li>sure to keep in mind that these are not completely foolproof, and they do require a certain ammount of skill and intuition to achieve good results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this kit at a local drugstore about 6-7 years ago, and it&#x27;s done well on my thick hair cutting 1-3 guard fades since then.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job for the price, but I haven&#x27;t used a stronger set in that time, so maybe I&#x27;m just used to it.</li>
    <li> In no time after opening the box I gave myself a quick professional looking hair cut. Everything was included to make the task easy. I glanced at the instructions and then went to work. The included comb / guides work great and made the cut easy. This first cut saved me $15 and the next will pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;I should have done this years ago.</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl Clipper pair before. It was a good pair of clippers. The pair I owned previously was white and black as pictured in your ad. That was the pair I wanted again. The pair I have now does not perform like the previous pair. So I&#x27;m stuck with the pair Ihave</li>
    <li> I am 100% satisfied with this product and it has already earned me what I paid for. I am able to trim my front portion of hair with this on my own, where as for a complete trim, I do need my wife&#x27;s assistance. If you trim on a regular basis, ie., when the hair&#x27;s not over grown, you will definitely find the job more easier.I recommend it to everyone who wants to save on their haircuts. The price is a good deal too if you buy from amazon, else one may perhaps ahve to wait for the Thanks giving sale!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband and he likes too much. Is a complete haicutting Kit. Ergonomic shape makes it easy to hold and cut at different angles.Has soft touch grip for comfort and control.Is very Quiet but really powerful. Great Deal!!</li>
    <li> Out of the box teeth did not move - realigned teeth - oiled - turned up power teeth moved noise very loud.&lt;br /&gt;scratched neck  pulled hair so I went back to old clipper. I have been using trimmers for 15 + years its probably one bad out of 100 but I got it so a bad review I had Wahl and Sunbeam in the past they worked great.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this unit, I had my hair cut with it.  The piece failed miserably with multiple painful snags and a haircut that used to take maybe 5 minutes nearly 30.  Details of the haircut is longest length was maybe an inch cutting down to a 1/4.  Yes, pretty much failed a buzz cut.</li>
    <li> Wahl is perhaps the best all-round clipper set. I was soooo satisfied with this set that I ended up buying three of them. I really hate going to barbers as they can be quite inconsistent, so I bought this set. The Wahl set has been so comfortable to use that I have been cutting my hair at home for the past few years. This set really, really does last that long.&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried a Conair clipper set and have been tremendously dissapointed with that one. Do not buy that if you are contemplating between Wahl and Conair....make sure you buy the Wahl instead. The Wahl gives you a clean cut that is very smooth, whereas the Conair feels like it&#x27;s pulling your hair rather than cutting it. Also, the Wahl comes with many pieces and additions/attachments you can add to it or purchase from the Wahl site. I would recommend Wahl to all first-time users as well as those who have been cutting their own hair for ages.</li>
    <li> I cut hair for years with this wahl set before I became a barber.  The wahl clippers cut almost as good as the tools I use in the shop.  The only disadvantage of these clippers is that they are not designed to do more than a few haircuts at a time (they get hot quickly), and in general they are not designed for the continual use of a barber shop (keep the blades oiled or they&#x27;ll dull quickly).  For doing a few occasional haircuts at home, these are definately the best clippers you&#x27;ll get for less than [X], and for the average family, they should definately last at least several years if properly cared for.  I&#x27;ve also tried a conair set, and I was very disappointed with the low quality of the accessories and they way the blades fed- they didn&#x27;t cut very well.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to keep in mind that these are not completely foolproof, and they do require a certain ammount of skill and intuition to achieve good results.</li>
    <li> After watching the video demonstrations a few times, I easily cut my husband&#x27;s hair and it turned out great--just like from the barber shop (well, almost--with practice, it will look even better).  The clipper is great quality, is easy to use, and works very well.  The scissors and guide combs, etc., that came with it were good quality, too, and very useful.  The video, though a bit dated, gives instructions for some very basic, classic haircuts for men that are not difficult to do.  We figure this clipper will pay for itself with 2 haircuts then we&#x27;ll be saving money each month by using this great product.  Highly recommended--and a good new hobby to take up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying products from Amazon.com for years but have never&lt;BR&gt;written a review.  This product inspired me to do so.  I have used it three times and a friend once.  It binds up and pulls the&lt;BR&gt;hair unless you move at a snails pace.  It takes me at least 20-&lt;BR&gt;30 minutes for what should be a quick buzz cut with one attachment.  I have since ordered a different product and plan on&lt;BR&gt;sending this to the landfill.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box, I gave myself a neat cut. It&#x27;s not perfect, but time will improve the results. Not ax pricey as some of the other choices. But easy to use and complete with helpful instructions, attachments and accessories. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve never cut anyone&#x27;s hair other than my own before. Now I&#x27;m living with my Military husband who has to go for haircuts every other week that costs him a fraction of his paycheck. Hey, even a fraction is money, right? So I decided, why not do it myself for him? No more drives to the barbershop miles away for him, no more waiting in the chair til he gets done for me.&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl Clipper is the first one I&#x27;ve ever owned and it&#x27;s so easy to use! I barely even watched the video, picked it up and was ready to go. Instructions on paper were easy to follow (even if you don&#x27;t have a degree in engineering!) but I was afraid I might mess up or pull his hairs. He said it didn&#x27;t hurt a bit, and I went slow and took my time. This machine has saved us money and we&#x27;ve all in all made back the amount of money spent on the Clipper. Definite bargain!&lt;br /&gt;The clippers have to be oiled each time after use and that&#x27;s not a big deal, the hairs on the clippers are easy to clean off with the brush that comes with the set, and the box is very chiq black. I love the package entirely both for the presentation AND usefulness. It&#x27;s not heavy and bulky at all, my small hands make it easier to handle rather than the opposite. My only qualm with it is that it heats up after awhile and gets uncomfortable, but that is probably because I took so long cutting his hair. After awhile, I got better at it and it took less long, and there was no problem at all with the heating. Great buy, great bargain!</li>
    <li> I wanted to be able to cut my own hair, in a simple crew-cut fashion.  That is, a #3 all over.  These clippers do that, no problem, so I cannot think of any reason to give them less than 5 stars.  For the price of two haircuts, I can keep my hair at the length I want it all the time.</li>
    <li> One haircut for my husband, another for my son, and the set was paid for.  Not too loud, either.  Lots of combs, clips and even a nice pair of scissors make this set an incredible value. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As described in other reviews, my first set was also biting.  I tried to adjust the blades to avoid this, and found that the white plastic piece that holds the second, inner blade was not installed at an angle, which made it impossible for the two blades to align.  Because it was more than 30 days since I received the set, I returned in directly to Wahl, who VERY promptly sent me a replacement set that is perfect.</li>
    <li> For about the past 12 years, my wife has been cutting my hair.  Normally, I keep my hair short in a crew cut, which makes cutting it a snap.  &lt;br /&gt;We had an older Wahl clipper which did the job quickly and painlessly.  But, it&#x27;s getting on in years, so when this turned up in my gold box, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;What a horrible mistake.&lt;br /&gt;These clippers simply don&#x27;t clip.  What they do is pull on the hair.  They rip the hair out.  They hurt!  I wind up flinching with each pass as my wife cuts my hair.  In the past, haircuts simply weren&#x27;t a big deal.  Now, we both dread them.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has to move so slowly with these clippers (so that the hair gets clipped and not yanked out) that what normally takes about 5 minutes now takes 20+.  &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good set of hair clippers, pass on these.</li>
    <li> The price is unbeatable. Easy to use and effective. Simply a well-designed product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Within an hour of receiving this kit I had watched the video and cut my own hair.  I have already received a couple of compliments on my haircut from people who didn&#x27;t know I did it myself.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what length I wanted so I started with a longer cut and gradually worked down through the guide combs until I got the length that I wanted.  I would even trust my wife to cut my hair with this clipper.  The quality seems very good and the instructions were excellent.</li>
    <li> Pretty quiet, not too much vibration for a bargain trimmer, cuts pretty low eventhough you may need a few passes. Had it for a month now and seems to run fine. Keep it oiled and clean and it should be fine.</li>
    <li> I love them! Great price and product!</li>
    <li> Ok, so the Wahl brand is a good one in my mind, so I thought for sure I was safe purchasing this haircut kit even though it was the cheapest I could find on Amazon. Well, apparently Wahl makes cheap China quality stuff too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first opened the thing up and tried to give myself a haircut one night around 11:30 PM. Sure enough everything I needed was in there, full selection of guards and trimmer attachments etc. It also came with full color directions on how to cut your own hair which was nice. Great. I prepared to let some hair fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair to begin with, but I figured I&#x27;d start a little longer than I usually need and then trim down from there. I started with a No. 5 trimmer attachment. Well, long - VERY long - story short, I didn&#x27;t actually finish the haircut until well after 1 AM. Granted, I&#x27;m more of a hair-cutting novice than anybody, but the fact is these here clippers are as weak as snot.  They jammed literally every 3 seconds of cutting. Oh, and I ended up with a No. 7 length haircut simply because it would NOT cut my hair with the No. 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About halfway through I realized that there had to be something wrong and I scoured the owners manual for a troubleshooting guide. It said you can actually turn up the clipper&#x27;s power with the adjustment screw on the side. So, after ruining the little plastic screwdriver they sent in the kit to no avail, I got a real screwdriver and adjusted the power. Ok, it was a lot better (I could actually CUT the hair), but it still jammed probably every 15 seconds. I would stop, knock out the little remnants of hair in the clippers, sometimes take the plate off, blow on it, put it back together and most of the time it worked. Sometimes it didn&#x27;t and I would have to insert various heated insults into the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit was cheap enough that it would be too much trouble to send back so here&#x27;s a lesson for me: cut your hair once a week so it only needs the faintest of trims. Lesson for you: don&#x27;t buy this if you have thick hair. If your hair is wispy thin you probably won&#x27;t have a problem, but otherwise steer clear and get something with a little more quality.e thick hair. If your hair is wispy thin you probably won&#x27;t have a problem, but otherwise steer clear and get something with a little more quality.</li>
    <li> It is a bad product that I can not even used on the first time to cut hair.</li>
    <li> I just saw this item in my gold box, but I&#x27;ve already got one. I&#x27;ve been needing a haircut, so I went and used them just now. For how little they cost, I think that they&#x27;re about as good as you can get in home haircutting \\&quot;technology\\&quot;. There are a few problems, of course... 1) Unless you are fastidious with your clipping, there will be tiny spots that don&#x27;t get cut the same height as the rest (tiny, tiny spots... easily fixed with a scissor after-clipping). 2) You really must oil them fairly regularly or they will begin to do a poor job. (Make sure to clean it out VERY well prior to oiling it too, or you&#x27;ll have a HUGE mess ... trust me, I found out the hard way). &lt;br /&gt;On the plus side ... 1) I can give myself a very good haircut (not great, but quite good) in about 5-10 minutes. 2) They&#x27;ve lasted for about 5 years of sporadic use (I still sometimes do go to the barber, so that may be a generous clipper lifespan estimate). 3) After about 3 cuts, you&#x27;ll have made your money back.&lt;br /&gt;After that its pure profit baby ... Well, you&#x27;ll save yourself the cost of a haircut anyway! :)&lt;br /&gt;To sum up :&lt;br /&gt;great for people who like short, simple haircuts. &lt;BR&gt;not great for people who are vain or who enjoy paying a ton at the barber/salon.</li>
    <li> One of the review below says &amp;quot;What they do is pull on the hair.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;It was true. I have bought it recently. My girlfriend cut my hair yesterday. The clipper often bit my hair (not cutting but biting!), which was slightly hurting.&lt;br /&gt;Although the other things was good, the biting made me uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I order this and was delighted with its appearance, but it literall jerked my hairs out and was excruciating, even with a high pain tolerance.  I tried various times unsuccessfully to correct this by oiling and following the mbiguous \\&quot;instructions\\&quot; and \\&quot;diagrams\\&quot; on how to align the blades, but nothing helped. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Have returned to my barber at $10/per cut.</li>
    <li> Says aligned and oiled at factory... Not even assembled.  \\&quot;Cutting\\&quot; blade in box.. Get in on and oiled...PULLED my hair out, didn&#x27;t cut... You can tell by the noise these won&#x27;t cut... JUNK  don&#x27;t buy...</li>
    <li> Was impressed by the attachments and the how-to video but the clippers were of poor quality and pulled on hair rather than cutting it.  My 5 year old was in tears within 30 seconds of use.  I returned mine for a refund.  Make sure you test clippers before buying it</li>
    <li> I searched around for a quite long time before I decide to purchase this model - the performance of this clipper is very poor, I have to switched back to my old kit to cut my son&#x27;s hair.  Very dispointed.</li>
    <li> This clipper replaced an old Wahl clipper I bought about 18 years ago (started locking up).  The only problem I have is I have to run it through the hair more slowly than my older one.  I tried adjusting the cutting plate as indicated in the instructions, but could not make it better (I could make it worse), although I may still not have it quite right.  If I run it through the hair too quickly, it doesn&#x27;t cut.  If I slow down--which does force me to pay attention more carefully, maybe that&#x27;s good--it cuts just fine.  I&#x27;m otherwise pleased with it, but have only had it a few months.</li>
    <li> The best you can buy for the price. These are some very good clippers. I really love mine!!!!.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to cut hair and  on the cover was \\&quot; Quiet But Powerful\\&quot;. Yeah and I have a peice of moon property to sell you...    I should have suspected from the inferior casing and badly packed pieces just thrown in at random with no contoured or individual spaces.    This thing is LOUD, VIBRATES worse than a badly packed washing machine and needs 4 or 5 passes to cut hair! It leaves your wrist sore from the vibration and ears numb from the noise.    If you handle chain saws then this is for you, if you want something quiet, friendly that doesn&#x27;t scare your child then look elsewhere... I know I am.    What a piece of junk!</li>
    <li> The razor can get clogged with hair and slow down or even stop cutting. You have to keep it cleaned and oiled! The replacement blades are [reasonably priced], almost 1/2 the cost of the razor. The plastic attachments are a bit flimzy and you can get knicked from them...</li>
    <li> This product is a must have. My wife has been cutting my hair off and on for the past 15 years with one pair of traditional scissors.  These clippers operate flawlessly.  No need to go to a barber since she has learned to use the clippers like a pro.  Comes with a case and an assortment of accessories.</li>
    <li> I bought the Wahl&#x27;s 15-piece haircutting kit recently. The 20-minute how-to video which provided a crash course in haircutting techniques was most useful. I used the clipper to cut my three children&#x27;s hair which grows amazingly fast. My husband liked the result so much that he lets me cut his hair! He was a real fussy customer at the barber&#x27;s and always came back fussing and complaining.  But he was so pleased with the Wahl&#x27;s Clippers that he vowed that he would never go to a barber again. Now we have extra money to spare.  We also save the time going out to the saloon. My only regret is that I did not buy it sooner.</li>
    <li> I am a student on budget and the Wahl clipper saves me about $180 a year + no waiting and no tipping. When not in use keep the clipper outside the bathroom. The dank air makes it rusty.</li>
    <li> I have had this clipper for almost 3 years now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros:  &lt;br /&gt;Very excellent trimmer.  The clipper itself is almost silent! &lt;br /&gt;Initially I was very pleased with it&#x27;s design, it&#x27;s use. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ability to trim was also very excellent.! &lt;br /&gt;I was happy &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After 3 years of usage here are some cons of the Clipper &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;The line cord is broken somewhere.  I have to jiggle the line cord up and down to get it started. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The flip switch is broken.  I guess flipping the switch up and down many times has gotten to it. The switch is very loose now.  I am afraid it&#x27;s gonna break off any day. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper set because i get my hair cut pretty short, and mostly with clippers when i go to the barber. However, it costs $15 a pop and this set cost about $30 with shipping. I&#x27;ve cut my hair twice, so I&#x27;m already even. I definitely recommend this set. The first time i used these clippers, i thought they were kind of underpowered, and they would pull my hair and not cut very well. Before the next time, i oiled them up, and noticed the power adjusting knob... Yeah, i wish i had read the manual! So much better than the first time. I really like these clippers now. Very cheap, and they do a very nice job. Get these, and start saving today!</li>
    <li> Great price. Very sharp and come with complete package with everything I need. It doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair make it painless to cut kids hair that help you save more money.</li>
    <li> This kit brings everything you need for haircut. I bought it for a friend and I hope that he likes it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice, thinking I just got a bad set on the first purchase. Nope, both are crap.    When you use them out of the box, they simply don&#x27;t cut hair well. They pull and tug and rip out hair.. and barely at that. They bind up with just the tiniest bunch of hair (my hair is very short (less than 1/8\\&quot;) and thin, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m overloading the clippers.    I noticed that the front set of teeth did not appear to be vibrating back and forth; they seemed to be mostly holding still. I&#x27;ve tried changing the position of the little control wheel that you can turn with a screwdriver, and this helps a little but then the things growl so loud you can&#x27;t stand to have them by your ears.    I tried slightly loosening the \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; set of teeth (I know there&#x27;s a more technical term.. maybe they&#x27;re just called &#x27;blades&#x27;?) thinking that the front set was pressed too tightly on the back set and that&#x27;s why the front wouldn&#x27;t vibrate and cut. That seemed to help a bit but then soon after the vibration causes the back teeth plate to become very loose and then then the clippers won&#x27;t cut again.    10 years back I owned some clippers from Oster, I believe, and they were beautiful. Worked perfectly, smoothly, quietly, right out of the box; just like you would expect.    I wouldn&#x27;t have another Wahl product if you paid me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not all that great dose not cut good at all. You  have to run it thro your hair 2 or 3 times before it cuts watse will have to buy new ones again</li>
    <li> Nice piece, I used it on my son&#x27;s hair, and I found some additional accessories I didn&#x27;t expect to get, the over the ear piece is a great addition.  The last one I bought lasted 12 years and is still going strong, just a little dull.</li>
    <li> Have used it once and works great. Even trimmed my beard. Was not very happy with the battery operated models, the battery would just stop after 2 or 3 minutes. Even after recharging.  Much happier with the corded version.  Took a while to be delivered. I have a PO Box, and it wasn&#x27;t sent USPS, so returned to amazon.  Had to reorder and finally got it delivered</li>
    <li> These clippers are terrible.  I thought that they would be perfect for cutting my boys hair, but I was wrong.  I have to go over each spot at least 10 times and it still misses several hairs.  I have tried oiling them, cleaning them, and adjusting them, but nothing seems to help - they simply don&#x27;t cut hair.</li>
    <li> nice piece of equipment to have at home. no more expensive cuts at the store. easy to use and easy to store</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. I rate a FIVE stars for the performance and the quality of hair cut.. No more to the barber shop...!&lt;br /&gt;Wahl products its the best.. It&#x27;s just quality&lt;br /&gt;Heppayahh</li>
    <li> I guess I was spoiled by the Wahl clippers I had owned for more than 20 years...the only reason I purchased a new one is because my old one was just getting too loud to use for any length of time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can&#x27;t express strongly enough how disappointed I was with these clippers...I found it completely difficult to believe that the company that made the clippers I was replacing with the product that I now had...and frankly, I can only discount this particular clipper...I&#x27;m sure Wahl has something worth buying...but this one is not it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one of the things that really bothered me is that Wahl makes too many different models...I just needed a clipper that I could use for trimming and shaping my goatee...reading the product descriptions, it seems I actually needed to buy two separate clipper sets to do two separate tasks...the clipper I needed to replace allowed me to do both...so I picked one that I though may have comparable to the one I owned...it wasn&#x27;t...not by a long shot. Heck, this clipper wouldn&#x27;t even cut the hairs on the back of my neck...I was really put off by this product.</li>
    <li> Buzz cuts are in. My husband likes the short look and so do I. We bought one of these and once a month I trim him up. It takes about 10 minutes. (We do it out on the terrace and that makes clean up even easier.)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about ($) to get a haircut, so after we used it twice, this cutter paid for itself. That&#x27;s a nice pizza on Saturday night or a movie for two. If I looked good in a buzz, I&#x27;d use it myself!</li>
    <li> My two sons have been getting haircuts at a total monthly cost of about $25.  Both of them like short haircuts.  After many years of seeing these \\&quot;hairdressers\\&quot; effortlessly using their clippers, I decided I would try to do it myself.  All I needed to know was what \\&quot;numbers\\&quot; were being used to cut their hair.  My older son likes a \\&quot;#1\\&quot; on the side and a \\&quot;#3\\&quot; on top.  After doing that, I blend it together (the video shows you how) and voila!  A haircut just as good as from the shop.  My boys liked their haircuts so much, they told me they want me to cut their hair every time.  As a bonus for me, my 14 year old asked me if he could give me a haircut.  I said \\&quot;Sure, why not.\\&quot;  He did a great job. (I let my wife \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my neck and around my ears).  For the cost of slightly more than one month of haircuts, these Wahl clippers will give us years of haircuts for free!</li>
    <li> We bought a clipper at a box store recently, without doing any research. It was only a few dollars less, but it was junk. It lasted exactly one haircut before a piece of the cheap plastic broke. This Wahl clipper, on the other hand, is of superior quality for a great price. It paid for itself is the first month.</li>
    <li> They have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut.  My hair is very short and this is unusual.  If you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out.  I spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better.  I would have been better buying a cheap pair at Walmart, which I normally do.</li>
    <li> I just got this kit to cut my almost 2-year-old son&#x27;s hair.  For the price, if I use it twice it has more than paid for itself v. going to the children&#x27;s hair salon (my husband&#x27;s barber won&#x27;t do children&#x27;s hair).  I&#x27;ve only used it once but the one I got is really quiet and doesn&#x27;t seem to pull at all.  The cord is a pretty decent length as well.  My son doesn&#x27;t mind me using it on him, I let him pretend to play Daddy&#x27;s X-Box while I&#x27;m doing it to get him to be kind of still.  There is a printed guide with photos that shows you how to cut hair.  I need practice, but at least right now all of his little friends don&#x27;t talk enough yet to be able to make fun of him!  They seem to be of good quality and I think once I get the hang of cutting hair they will work very well.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for around 12 years now.  Now, I don&#x27;t do any kind of fancy hairstyles, but rather whats called a \\&quot;Burr cut\\&quot;.  Yeah, so what about all the add-ons that came with this package...???, well I won&#x27;t be using them, but the clipper did came with its hard-on carrying case and the model was the cheapest wahl that came with a taper control for a much clean cut.  The blue thingy does make it more comfortable when cutting your hair.</li>
    <li> Although they offer a lot of guard options they were flimsy and cheaply made along with the case and extra items. Sometimes while clipping it misses spots but generally what I expected for the price. Guards are replaceable I suppose</li>
    <li> I use it ocasionally in between barbershop trips. Pays for itself. Has many hair length attachments. Sharp. Nice carry case.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and new, the set is perfect using at home, this was a gift for my brother, but I&#x27;ve saved money &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t need to go to the barber shop.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have.  First of all, my wife has been cutting my hair for the past 2 1/2 years with one pair of traditional scissors.  At that time, I was a student.  Obviously, I didn&#x27;t have much $$ to go to barber shop each month just to stay in shape.  &lt;br /&gt;After I graduate, I found a job.  Although I have a decent salary.  However, priorites changed.  Now I have to save money to buy a condo or townhouse.  Also, my wife told me that I need to have a better hair cut for work.  So, I found this Wahl clipper.  It&#x27;s a really handy clipper.  It comes with everything you ever needed to cut a professional hair cut with fraction of the cost of going to barber shop.  The best tool is the video.  It gives you a good idea on where you need start when cutting hair (especially useful for beginners).  After my wife uses the Wahl clipper to cut my hair, I can&#x27;t believe many of my collegaues gave me compliment on how nice my hair look. &lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for listing this item for sale.  Only $20.  Even you go to barber shop one time, it already cost you $15 or more. For people like myself who likes to save money, then the Wahl clipper is a must have.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Clipper last year as a back-up for my old Wahl Clipper which I thought might be nearing the end of its life.  My old clipper died this week (after YEARS of use), and I opened this replacement model.  Even the outside case was inferior in quality to my old model, and when I turned it on, it hummed feebly, but would not actually cut hair.  Beware.</li>
    <li> I use this monthly.  Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as some others, but works just fine and it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice &amp; handy family clipper. The family member I bought it for just needed to use a small voltage converter as they use 220v out there.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an overall great kit with accessories that are suitable for a nearly professional cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with another model which has color comps, this one is totally ok and more complete in the accessories point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to achieve self-cutting, hard practices are essential.</li>
    <li> Bought this hair cutting kit over 5 years ago, and I still use it to this day. Keep it oiled and sharp and it will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I see now why another version of this device had colored attachments.  They are a little hard to tell apart, and the numbers are just embossed, so you have to hold them just right to read them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s been great.  My wife cut my hair with it with ease, and before that I had tried trimming it a little myself and liked the results that far.  I&#x27;d have finished it myself, but it was easier to have my wife do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us have any previous experience cutting hair, but the instructions did a good job teaching us what we needed to know, and what steps to take.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair, and our son&#x27;s hair. One cut each and it has paid for itself.itself itself again</li>
