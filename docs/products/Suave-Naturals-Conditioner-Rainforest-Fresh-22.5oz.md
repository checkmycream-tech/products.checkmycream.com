      <li>conditioner works okay for my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the guy that chooses his shampoo and conditioner based on the last hotel he stayed at, so I&#x27;m not the best judge of this stuff</li>
      <li>which is my favorite conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I love the scent of this matching conditioner and shampoo.</li>
      <li>conditioner worked for most people in our family with short-medium hair.  </li>
      <li>, though, I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time as, I need more of a smoothing conditioner.</li>
      <li>The Rainforest scent is refreshing and is like aroma therapy for your hair.</li>
      <li>I go more for the Morrocan.  </li>
      <li>The bottle claims that this conditioner provides two times more moisture.  </li>
      <li>I use it mostly on the ends, but I will sometimes go up to my scalp.</li>
      <li>I love conditioning my hair.  </li>

      <li>The scent is nice and fresh and pleasing to the senses.</li>
      <li>This particular conditioner isn&#x27;t anything very remarkable, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really meant to be.</li>
      <li>You use a fair amount to saturate your hair, but it feels nice and creamy, rinses cleanly, and leaves your hair soft and tangle-free.</li>
      <li>The one thing I liked is the size of the bottle (it&#x27;s large!)</li>
      <li>shampoo lathers well &amp; easily rinses out.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels wonderfully soft afterwards and, best of all, the scent really tends to linger.</li>
      <li>Formula is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>the kids and I like this just fine, and recommend you give it a try.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty nice example of quality cheap conditioner.</li>
      <li>It works great to make sure that his scalp is clean and his hair is properly conditioned.</li>
      <li>Kudos to Suave for the light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Suave \\&quot;Naturals\\&quot; line is hypoallergenic which is important if you have any sensitivities.</li>
      <li>Definitely a great, inexpensive choice for daily hair care.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be happy to have this as my regular conditioner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The rainforest conditioner (&amp; shampoo) fragrance is a light fragrance &amp; doesn&#x27;t stick with you throughout the day.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel overly conditioned and greasy.</li>
      <li>It could also probably be pretty good for someone whose hair doesn&#x27;t need particularly intensive stuff at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like its matching shampoo, [[ASIN:B00A0IWTDI Suave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo]], this conditioner is a solid performer at a great price.  </li>
      <li>This mild conditioner is affordable and works well to smooth my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is a clean rain scent and not overpowering for the amount that she uses.  </li>
      <li>While it behaved like most suave products (great cleanliness and body for very little money)</li>
      <li>To me, this conditioner smells too sweet.  </li>
      <li>I do not think fragrance is overpowering, but I find it to be just too sweet for having it in my hair while going to work.  </li>
      <li>The scents seem to linger on better that way, and that&#x27;s what really sells me on their line of shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A good solid product that gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I love products with fragrance and really like the smell of this with its aloe and bamboo extracts.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t expect a true Rainforest scent from it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all, but  </li>
      <li>bottle is easy to hold, even in the wet shower and the conditioner comes out of the spout in a good amount to condition my hair.</li>
      <li>This is more for normal hair or someone who doesn&#x27;t need a special product for smoothing or body.</li>
      <li>My husband is super picky when it comes to the shampoos he uses, and don&#x27;t even bother trying to get him to use conditioner.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nice, big bottle and ships for free if you have Amazon Prime.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to get sticky/clumpy with certain conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has a light &#x27;green growing&#x27; non-flowery smell that doesn&#x27;t linger but is pleasant when using.  </li>
      <li>It is a pleasant, forgettable (in a good way) fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really get away with using \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; conditioner, but my daughter and sister were fine with this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too light to get the job done on hair that really needs it.</li>
      <li>B00A0IWTDI Suave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo, 22.5 Ounce]] and my hair is not frizzy or overly</li>
      <li>Fresh Conditioner,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the Rainforest Fresh scent is a nice addition to the regular Suave line-up.</li>
      <li>Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>but overall I liked the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t a powerful conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Suave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Conditioner.</li>
      <li>Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo, 22.5 Ounce]]</li>
      <li>those super heavy and intense products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the kind of thing that I think can be kinda nice to use as a relatively inexpensive product to use between more intensive treatments if your hair doesn&#x27;t do well going without anything.</li>
      <li>They were right on.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner worked well for me - went into hair smoothly and did the conditioning I&#x27;d expect - light, not heavy-feeling that weighs hair down, clean, and yet smooth and without frizzies.  </li>
      <li>Cheap conditioners often have heavy, cloying fragrance, or obnoxious fruit roll-ups scents, but this one is light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Add cup of white vinegar (or more).</li>

    <li> I have not used this item for hair. I purchase conditioner to make my own fabric softener. Mix at least 20oz of conditioner with 1 cup of water (must be Hot to avoid clumping mix. Add cup of white vinegar (or more). Add water to dilute to desired thickness. Vinegar brighten clothes and removes odor. Choose your choice of conditioner scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s conditioner. Not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s good. It smells nice, and seems to work just as conditioner should. The one thing I liked is the size of the bottle (it&#x27;s large!), so it should last a while. Definitely recommended, but your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> While it behaved like most suave products (great cleanliness and body for very little money) I thought the smell was a little too \\&quot;evergreen\\&quot; for my senses.</li>
    <li> But a great alternative to shave gel! I used it for a few days as conditioner but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for my hair. I have very thick wavy hair and this conditioner didn&#x27;t leave it feeling as soft or shiny as I like. So instead of wasting it I decided to use it when I shave my legs. It works great and leaves my legs feeling very soft and \\&quot;conditioned\\&quot; after shaving. The rainforest scent is wonderful as well. A nice clean fresh scent, perfect for spring and summer!</li>
    <li> Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Conditioner.  I love conditioning my hair.  This particular conditioner is really awesome.  Before I go any further, I will let you know that I do highly recommend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful.  It does its job wonderfully.  Suave products are high quality and well-trusted, for me anyway, as I have been using them for as long as I can remember!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the word \\&quot;rainforest\\&quot;, that&#x27;s when I knew I wanted this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love exotic things, and I love the thought of rainforests!!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner rinses easily and smells great.  Very refreshing scent that lingers, with a very pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the senses.&lt;br /&gt;This is good for everyday use, but still need the occasional deep conditioner to keep my long hair soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is good conditioner, and it&#x27;s CHEAP. I like the melony floraly scent and the fact that this conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave any residue when it rinses out -- I have coarse hair and it&#x27;s easy to get sticky/clumpy with certain conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice, big bottle and ships for free if you have Amazon Prime. At it&#x27;s low price point I think this is a great item for families using Amazon Prime to purchase batches of household items.</li>
    <li> This conditioner from Suave is very thin, almost runny.  I feel like the conditioner just runs off my hair after application rather than actually conditioning it.  I&#x27;ve used the conditioner for a month and am starting to notice my hair has less \\&quot;body.\\&quot;  My hair is shoulder-length and I&#x27;ve experienced some tangling with a bit of frizziness after using Suave; if my hair was much longer, I think I&#x27;d find this conditioner completely unacceptable.  On the plus side, the \\&quot;rainforest fresh\\&quot; scent is barely discernible (I don&#x27;t like scented products).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both of these products on my head of hair and even on my beard and softness wise I go more for the Morrocan.  I also prefer the scent left by the Moroccan product.  However, the Suave Natural is less expensive.  Just don&#x27;t expect a true Rainforest scent from it.</li>
    <li> Suave products are marketed as affordable options for those on a limited budget. There are better conditioners out there, but honestly I&#x27;m not sure they are worth the several dollars that you save by buying Suave. This conditioner leaves your hair soft and clean and for me, lasts the whole day long. The scent is nice and fresh and pleasing to the senses. The bottle is easy to open and close and I can truly find no negative aspect to this product.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with Suave conditioners.  I always thought, since they were so inexpensive, they must not be a quality product.  However, I have found that that is not the case.  The Suave Rainforest Fresh conditioner and the other Suave conditioner I have used actually work better than some much more expensive \\&quot;salon\\&quot; brands I have tried.  This conditioner leaves my long fine hair soft, smooth, and detangled without being weighed down.  The fragrance is pleasant without being overwhelming. You really can&#x27;t get a better conditioner for this price, so don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive brands when this one works so well.</li>
    <li> The best part of this conditioner is the way it smells. The rainforest scent is so fresh and clean smelling and it leaves a subtle scent on my hair all day. I&#x27;ve tried fruit scented hair products before and it makes me feel like food. This conditioner just makes me feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is easy to hold, even in the wet shower and the conditioner comes out of the spout in a good amount to condition my hair. I use it mostly on the ends, but I will sometimes go up to my scalp. The 22.5 fluid ounces are probably enough to last a family months. It says it&#x27;s infused with aloe and bamboo extract and boasts that it&#x27;s up to two times as moisturizing versus non-conditioning shampoo. I&#x27;m not sure what comparing a conditioner to a shampoo means, but that is the claim on the bottle. I&#x27;ve most recently been using Aveda and TreSemme conditioners. This Suave conditioner works just as well for my long, somewhat fine hair and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than the Aveda products. I&#x27;m quite happy to continue using this Suave conditioner.</li>
    <li> Suave is a good VALUE brand - they do not disappoint with this Suave Naturals &#x27;Rainforest Fresh&#x27; conditioner - it&#x27;s a nice, big bottle of Suave conditioner, comes at a great value price and does what it says...conditions.  While Suave is not my brand of choice for everyday use (Pantene has always done well with my hair), it is a great VALUE choice to have in a pinch: I keep an extra bottle around for quick/easy travel or use when I run out of my usual shampoo and conditioners...I especially like Suave&#x27;s body wash, it&#x27;s also a good value and works well.  This conditioned my hair well, not fabulously deep conditioning, but just normal conditioning, and I would recommend this value product from Suave!</li>
    <li> When my husband buys Suave Shampoo, I&#x27;ll usually go out and get the accompanying conditioner.  The scents seem to linger on better that way, and that&#x27;s what really sells me on their line of shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Rainforest Fresh scent in Suave shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t go over quite so well in the conditioner.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but I&#x27;m not crazy over it.  It&#x27;s not bad at all, but  it doesn&#x27;t wow me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does detangle, so it does its job as far as what I want it to do.  I&#x27;ll give it four stars.</li>
    <li> Like its matching shampoo, [[ASIN:B00A0IWTDI Suave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo]], this conditioner is a solid performer at a great price.  The smell is pleasant but not overpowering, and it leaves hair softer and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife prefers Suave&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00A0IWRU8 Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner]] and its matching shampoo for extra shine and manageability, but the kids and I like this just fine, and recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice example of quality cheap conditioner. It&#x27;s not ultra-rich or concentrated, but it&#x27;s not watered down either. It&#x27;s a solid, classic creme rinse. You use a fair amount to saturate your hair, but it feels nice and creamy, rinses cleanly, and leaves your hair soft and tangle-free. It&#x27;s a great everyday conditioner, not deep conditioning, but you don&#x27;t have to stand around waiting for it to work, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the light fresh scent. Cheap conditioners often have heavy, cloying fragrance, or obnoxious fruit roll-ups scents, but this one is light and refreshing. I&#x27;d be happy to have this as my regular conditioner.</li>
    <li> Suave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Conditioner. This conditioner is recommended for all hair types and textures. Suave Rainforest Condition is infused with aloe and bamboo extract. I would recommend this conditioner for anyone who has thin/straight or slightly wavy hair, but for those of us with thick hair or curly hair this isn&#x27;t going to do much for you.&lt;br /&gt;Like most conditioners after shampooing it recommends you leave in your hair for 3-5 minutes before rinsing out. The Rainforest scent is refreshing and is like aroma therapy for your hair. A good conditioner just not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the guy that chooses his shampoo and conditioner based on the last hotel he stayed at, so I&#x27;m not the best judge of this stuff but overall I liked the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is designed to stand \\&quot;upside down\\&quot; in the shower thereby making sure you get every last drop of the product.  The scent was crisp and not overpowering. It reminded me of a milder Irish Spring.&lt;br /&gt; The product did soften my hair without feeling oily or leaving too much of a shine. A good solid product that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My husband is super picky when it comes to the shampoos he uses, and don&#x27;t even bother trying to get him to use conditioner.  However, with the Men&#x27;s 2 and 1 that this offers, he uses it and he loves it.  It works great to make sure that his scalp is clean and his hair is properly conditioned.</li>
    <li> Suave is always good. The fragrance is light and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel overly conditioned and greasy. All Suave products are generally good and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> So I admit I don&#x27;t always buy Suave and often tend to stick to pricier brands, but Suave is a brand with which I grew up and... its conditioner has always been a little favorite of mine that only seemed to improve with the Naturals line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular conditioner is pretty much what I have come to trust in my conditioner.  The creamy consistency is the same, the product clings well to the the hair and rinses out easily, and the scent here is truly amazing--definitely fresh and tropical.  My hair feels wonderfully soft afterwards and, best of all, the scent really tends to linger.</li>
    <li> Before I received this shampoo &amp; conditioner to review, I already had some suave shampoo &amp; conditioner in my shower.  It&#x27;s a great basic shampoo, nothing fancy, it&#x27;s affordable, lasts my husband and myself a long time. Bathe rainforest fresh smell is nice!  I&#x27;m enjoying using it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner comes in 22.5oz (family size).  I guess the reason it is called Rainforest Fresh is because the main ingredients are aloe and bamboo extract.  I use this conitioner after Suave shampoo.  The bottle claims that this conditioner provides two times more moisture.  To me, this conditioner smells too sweet.  So I use it after exercising - which means in the evening after I come back from the gym.  I do not think fragrance is overpowering, but I find it to be just too sweet for having it in my hair while going to work.  Formula is not too strong.  It never itches if it gets in the eyes, so if you have small children, this product is safe to be used for them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other nice thing about this product is that it comes in a recyclable plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> This is decent for normal hair, when buying in a bulky bottle at cost efficient. I can&#x27;t really get away with using \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; conditioner, but my daughter and sister were fine with this. I have super thick, wavy hair. Daughter has thin, baby soft hair and sis slightly thicker, straight, heavily product. Not a huge fan of rainforest smell either, but thats just personal preference.</li>
    <li> Years ago, Suave advertised that its line-up of shampoo/conditioners were \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; at a budget price.  They were right on.  With the exception of their clarifying line, the regular Suave shampoos/conditioners have been my choice for years - and I regularly received compliments on my soft &amp; shiny hair.  The Rainforest Fresh combo is no different - it leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers well &amp; easily rinses out.  The conditioner is thick &amp; is easy to massage into your scalp. It also rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rainforest conditioner (&amp; shampoo) fragrance is a light fragrance &amp; doesn&#x27;t stick with you throughout the day. It is a pleasant, forgettable (in a good way) fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Rainforest Fresh scent is a nice addition to the regular Suave line-up. Kudos to Suave for the light fragrance.</li>
    <li> This particular conditioner isn&#x27;t anything very remarkable, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really meant to be. It smells pretty good, but not spectacular. It conditions a bit, but it&#x27;s not one of those super heavy and intense products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the kind of thing that I think can be kinda nice to use as a relatively inexpensive product to use between more intensive treatments if your hair doesn&#x27;t do well going without anything. It could also probably be pretty good for someone whose hair doesn&#x27;t need particularly intensive stuff at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has its place, and the price isn&#x27;t bad for the size, it just doesn&#x27;t do anything extraordinary that sets it far apart from the other options</li>
    <li> I shampoo and condition my hair everyday even though it tends to be dry because of home coloring and other products I use. This mild conditioner is affordable and works well to smooth my hair. It is not an intensive treatment for damaged hair. I love products with fragrance and really like the smell of this with its aloe and bamboo extracts. I pair it with the [[ASIN:B00A0IWTDI Suave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo, 22.5 Ounce]] and my hair is not frizzy or overly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave \\&quot;Naturals\\&quot; line is hypoallergenic which is important if you have any sensitivities. Definitely a great, inexpensive choice for daily hair care.</li>
    <li> This conditioner worked well for me - went into hair smoothly and did the conditioning I&#x27;d expect - light, not heavy-feeling that weighs hair down, clean, and yet smooth and without frizzies.  The scent is always a deal breaker for me.  This has a light &#x27;green growing&#x27; non-flowery smell that doesn&#x27;t linger but is pleasant when using.  In all, I think this is a great purchase at a great price.</li>
    <li> Suave puts out good products that you don&#x27;t have to pay a lot for and this is no exception. This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it smells great too. I like the rainforest scent.  The conditioner May not work as  great as some higher-priced products but it still does a good job.</li>
    <li> I tried out the [[ASIN:B00A0IWTDI Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo, 22.5 Ounce]] and I was shocked at what a great bargain it was--you get a giant bottle of decent shampoo for very little money.  Of course, the natural companion is the \\&quot;Rainforest Fresh Conditioner,\\&quot; so that&#x27;s what I tried next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the shampoo, the conditioner is infused with aloe and bamboo (And again, I&#x27;m not sure what good bamboo is supposed to do for your skin, other than to sound exotic on the packaging).  The smell is the Yankee Candle version of \\&quot;Rainforest Fresh\\&quot; and smells nothing like an actual rainforest or an actual bamboo forest.  The best I can say is that it smells \\&quot;green,\\&quot; and is a pleasant enough way to start your morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a powerful conditioner.  I have short hair, so it does the trick for me, but my wife has super-long, think Asian hair and she wasn&#x27;t a fan of this conditioner. It&#x27;s too light to get the job done on hair that really needs it.</li>
    <li> The Suave Rainforest line convinced us we no longer needed to spend $20 on Shampoo and another $20 on conditioner.  You can get a giant bottle of each for $5.00 (total) and in today&#x27;s economy, I will jump at that chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner worked for most people in our family with short-medium hair.  However, when it came to our daughter&#x27;s use, who has long hair, she indicated it did not work that well.  So, how it works on you will obviously depend on your hair type.  As for the Rainforest smell- I don&#x27;t think so.  It&#x27;s not uunpleasant in any manner, just did not remind me of a rainforest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I highly recommend you give this product a shot.  It may save you quite a bit of money.</li>
    <li> My little girls hair is long and tangles tightly... so she uses a lot of conditioner.  That can be expensive, so its good that this product both works well and isn&#x27;t pricey.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a clean rain scent and not overpowering for the amount that she uses.  Her hair is semi dry and this gives her a little more control</li>
    <li> For reference, I have baby fine, long, naturally wavy hair with highlights and lowlights. My hair tends to get frizzy and dry-looking on the ends and I usually have to use a frizz-reducing conditioner [[ASIN:B005SPETH2 Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] which is my favorite conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner works okay for my hair, though, I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time as, I need more of a smoothing conditioner. This is more for normal hair or someone who doesn&#x27;t need a special product for smoothing or body. Though, for not being a special smoothing conditioner this does leave my hair fairly managable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is a great choice for those on a budget or for large families as this is a large bottle which would last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the scent of this matching conditioner and shampoo. They have just a nice, clean scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would repurchase this if my favorite wasn&#x27;t available, it&#x27;s a great all-around product.</li>
