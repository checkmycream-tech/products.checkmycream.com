      <li>People this is one of the best non prescription retinol creams that I have ever get the chance to use.</li>
      <li>This has been the best product I have EVER used.</li>
      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>The cream is very good and moisturizes your skin.</li>
      <li>This is a great item to try on the surface of your hands (not palms), neck, and the abdomen if you have stretch marks/loose skin.  </li>
      <li>They feel great</li>
      <li>(1) It does contain mineral oil and coconut oil, which is not so great if you are prone to acne.  </li>
      <li>The tea tree oil is great for blemishes.</li>
      <li>My face feels great.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>it feels great on my face and neck, not greasy at all and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The blemish stick is great for &amp;</li>
      <li>AMAZING!</li>
      <li>It did not make a difference , but it feels good</li>
      <li>This makes you wonder if ordering cosmetics on line is a good idea since heat will change the composition of cosmetics.</li>
      <li>Neutragena also has a good lower-concentration</li>
      <li>this stuff smells so good and works well on blemish spots.</li>
      <li>I recommended this to my sister and she tried it and loved it and gave a jar to her sister-in-law.  </li>
      <li>The Neutrogena retinol products have great reviews, and I have even had better results with those than prescription Retin-A.  </li>
      <li>A really great deal on a couple of my favorite produts, I am going to reorder asap.</li>
      <li>Love It!</li>
      <li>I love it on my legs and feet !</li>
      <li>Great deal and great product and fast ship!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>So I kind of have to say you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>So many reasons I&#x27;m happy with this :-)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective it was.  </li>
      <li>Rich, creamy feeling that does not get oily and does absorb very nicely into the skin</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing for winter skin, not to oily and works so much better than anything else on the market.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s an excellent choice for those who have sensitive skin or combination as I do.</li>
      <li>This may be true, but like many reviewers, I&#x27;ve had good results this.  </li>
      <li>The cream is ok.</li>
      <li>Sitting here now broke out more than ever.</li>
      <li>I love that this comes with the roll on.  </li>
      <li>Like most of the people giving this 5-star reviews, I have no idea what this product is like.</li>
      <li>i have tried many.</li>
      <li>Love the blemish roll on it too really works great.</li>
      <li>the retinol cream has done many wonders.</li>
      <li>I am not so sure I would suggest using it on the face, however, for two reasons.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Really like the free tee tree oil stick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as potent as actually purchasing tea tree oil and using on blemishes, but maybe the fact that it&#x27;s not as strong is ideal for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The free herbal authority blemish roll on wasa true bonus.</li>
      <li>I be sure to use a light layer of it and highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>but, by the next morning my skin was all good again.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Tea Tree Oil.</li>
      <li>Also, just a reminder to never use retinol containing products if pregnant or breastfeeding.  </li>
      <li>However, it is mild.  </li>
      <li>My husband, who is not one for complements, said how great my face looked, and this is while we were outside in the real daylight.</li>
      <li>Really!!</li>
      <li>I use this on my face and neck and have noticed definite positive changes in my skin looking and feeling more supple and healthy...</li>
      <li>As someone who has taken many pains to even out and clear up my acne-prone skin-</li>
      <li>I just seemed appropriate to make a mockery of the star rating, since most other reviewers are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I particularly recommend the Baby Face product available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice smelling lotion, and very creamy, but I will cave and go back to my old retinol lotion from La Cerise (also sold on Amazon).</li>
      <li>Both products feel good on my sensitive skin and helps with the occasional break outs.</li>
      <li>However, by the time it got to my house the container was really hot and the cream was hot as well.</li>
      <li>but I thought maybe she&#x27;d be able to get away with only using the blemish stick on a wknd.</li>
      <li>These are pricier and you get a smaller amount, but they have more face-friendly ingredients.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and it is a thick cream which I like.</li>
      <li>#34;in between&amp;#34; use of the pure tree tea oil,</li>
      <li>The former one has more natural ingredients first.</li>
      <li>The FDA only requires that the ingredients listed need to be accurate.</li>
      <li>I really wish they had a warning label about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my experience, products with Retinol work very well.  </li>
      <li>It works FAST.</li>
      <li>---thankfully it wears off fast.  </li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I am supremely happy with all three beauty products - Scarguard Scarlight MF, 0.5 Ounces, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs, and Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 Oz, that I purchased on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Look like a teen but am many years far removed from those years.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m a 30 yr old caucasian with fair skin (blonde, blue eyes...)</li>
      <li>I love the blemish roll because it is all natural, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and helps with my blackheads.</li>
      <li>After using both products for the past two weeks, my complextion is amazing.</li>
      <li>does not mean that all dogs are Beagles.</li>
      <li>I let it set in for several minutes, until it&#x27;s absorbed, and then I apply my moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>used this cream for the first time and ready to order 3 extra pots.</li>
      <li>With consistent use (and consistency is the key with this), it really does seem to make these areas smoother and improve the appearance of wrinkling.  </li>
      <li>Live abroad</li>
      <li>Several people who read my original review responded that \\&quot;Vitamin A is the same as Retinol.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>The first night I used this cream, I looked like a bobble head in the mirror trying to figure out where my freckles went on my cheeks which have tended to blend into one big freckle in my old age.  </li>
      <li>I get so dry in some areas and usually right next</li>
      <li>First, before you buy these two together...keep in mind that the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; blemish stick is more expensive than the retinol cream itself---if you buy the retinol tub separately, you can currently find it on Amazon for $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol</li>
      <li>will definatlely buy this same product again when I need to renew my 52 yeard old skin has never felt softer or smoother.</li>
      <li>With consistent use in areas where you are prone to acne, it can cut down on breakouts.  </li>
      <li>My face is so soft, an no longer dry in spots.</li>

<li> The only issue I have is I break out a little</li>
<li> Some reviewers pointed out that retinol (Vitamin A derivative) is not very potent when stored in a tub like this because of all the exposure to the environment when you open the tub.  </li>
<li> I think I&#x27;ll probably mix half water and half vinegar in the future :</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not positive it is due to this cream.  </li>
<li> Not with active ingredient..</li>
<li> When I received the cream the lid was half off</li>
<li> so take every time a few pots from the USA and order them online so they are there when I arrive in the USA</li>

    <li> used this cream for the first time and ready to order 3 extra pots. Live abroad so take every time a few pots from the USA and order them online so they are there when I arrive in the USA</li>
    <li> First, before you buy these two together...keep in mind that the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; blemish stick is more expensive than the retinol cream itself---if you buy the retinol tub separately, you can currently find it on Amazon for $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Cream review:  Some reviewers pointed out that retinol (Vitamin A derivative) is not very potent when stored in a tub like this because of all the exposure to the environment when you open the tub.  This may be true, but like many reviewers, I&#x27;ve had good results this.  I am not so sure I would suggest using it on the face, however, for two reasons.  (1) It does contain mineral oil and coconut oil, which is not so great if you are prone to acne.  (2) Also, there is an added fragrance and it&#x27;s not very nice---thankfully it wears off fast.  This is a great item to try on the surface of your hands (not palms), neck, and the abdomen if you have stretch marks/loose skin.  With consistent use (and consistency is the key with this), it really does seem to make these areas smoother and improve the appearance of wrinkling.  For this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong for those areas----and this tub will last you a long time.  If looking for something for your face only, you may want to check out the Neutrogena anti-wrinkle products that contain retinol.  These are pricier and you get a smaller amount, but they have more face-friendly ingredients.  The Neutrogena retinol products have great reviews, and I have even had better results with those than prescription Retin-A.  *Also, just a reminder to never use retinol containing products if pregnant or breastfeeding.  I really wish they had a warning label about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blemish stick review:  I do like the blemish stick.  It&#x27;s not as potent as actually purchasing tea tree oil and using on blemishes, but maybe the fact that it&#x27;s not as strong is ideal for sensitive skin.  With consistent use in areas where you are prone to acne, it can cut down on breakouts.  However, it is mild.  It is anice alternative to benzoyl peroxide though----as that will inactivate retinol.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the product I received. When I received the cream the lid was half off and the seal was broken and pushed down into the jar. I was very disappointed. Rule of thumb is if the seal is broken do not use it. So I returned the cream for refund. T.</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching a Dr Oz program about cosmetics and how we are wasting our money on unneccesary overpriced creams, loitions and potions. I have always believed  simpler is easier if not better.&lt;br /&gt;I now use  Hyluronic Serum, toner day cream regime and rectinol for my night cream. I must say my skin is so softfrom using this on my face neck, chest and hands. I do think the skin tone has improved some but i do have some years of sun damage so, no astonishing miracles yet. The free herbal authority blemish roll on wasa true bonus. It works FAST. This has been the best product I have EVER used. i have tried many. I do not have bad break outs or acne but do getthe occasional blemish, or deep cyst like belmish that sticks aroind forever.&lt;br /&gt;I just use this rool one once or twice a day and minor blemishes are gone the next day and deeper cysts like ones are gone in 3-4 days.(as long as you leave them alone)&lt;br /&gt;I will definatlely buy this same product again when I need to renew my 52 yeard old skin has never felt softer or smoother.</li>
    <li> I have had extreme Rosasea problems for last couple of years. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Nothing was working on my red bumps around my mouth, nose, or cheeks. Until NOW! The Retinol cream is not oily although it feels thick to the touch in the container. You only need a dab. My face is so soft, an no longer dry in spots. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Tea Tree Oil. It&#x27;s amazing. After using both products for the past two weeks, my complextion is amazing. AMAZING! I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror; Really!! My husband, who is not one for complements, said how great my face looked, and this is while we were outside in the real daylight. Try it, and you will be writing a review just like this. Love It!</li>
    <li> The smell kills me on this one.  Just can&#x27;t overcome it.  The cream feels pretty thick, too.  When it&#x27;s on, you know it.  This is not for me.</li>
    <li> How can the roll-on be &amp;#34;FREE&amp;#34; when the cream is only $6.5 if purchased separately? Duh, hello totally false advertising!</li>
    <li> The first night I used this cream, I looked like a bobble head in the mirror trying to figure out where my freckles went on my cheeks which have tended to blend into one big freckle in my old age.  I recommended this to my sister and she tried it and loved it and gave a jar to her sister-in-law.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective it was.  Sun will bring the spots back, but at least this really works to lighten them for a bit.  The only issue I have is I break out a little but I&#x27;m not positive it is due to this cream.  I be sure to use a light layer of it and highly recommend it.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction so of course my rating is not high. This is a very nice smelling lotion, and very creamy, but I will cave and go back to my old retinol lotion from La Cerise (also sold on Amazon). The former one has more natural ingredients first. So I kind of have to say you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The cream is ok. I haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice anything. The smell is pleasant and it is a thick cream which I like. However, by the time it got to my house the container was really hot and the cream was hot as well. This makes you wonder if ordering cosmetics on line is a good idea since heat will change the composition of cosmetics. The tea tree roll on is awful. Weird smell. I did not like it and will not use it.</li>
    <li> Like most of the people giving this 5-star reviews, I have no idea what this product is like. I just seemed appropriate to make a mockery of the star rating, since most other reviewers are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Check out &#x27;See All My Reviews&#x27; from 5* reviewers. You&#x27;ll see that this is the only product they have reviewed or that they only review 5* products.]</li>
    <li> Ive been using this all over my body for three years!  I love it on my legs and feet !</li>
    <li> My face broke out so I quit using the Retinol cream but kept using the blemish roll. Sitting here now broke out more than ever. Look like a teen but am many years far removed from those years. Can&#x27;t recommend because of my results, who know , it might work for someone else.</li>
    <li> The cream is very good and moisturizes your skin. I love the blemish roll because it is all natural, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and helps with my blackheads. I think it&#x27;s an excellent choice for those who have sensitive skin or combination as I do.</li>
    <li> Several people who read my original review responded that \\&quot;Vitamin A is the same as Retinol.\\&quot;  Well, actually, no it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is a specific form of Vitamin A. Just because a Beagle is a dog does not mean that all dogs are Beagles. If you want to buy a Beagle, then may be disappointed if you shop at a store that says \\&quot;Dogs for Sale.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, products with Retinol work very well.  I particularly recommend the Baby Face product available on Amazon.  Neutragena also has a good lower-concentration product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether this product works well because I didn&#x27;t use it.  I wanted Retinol, so I discarded this product and purchased Baby Face.  If you want Retinol, then I&#x27;d suggest buying a product that specifically lists Retinol as an ingredient.  But don&#x27;t be fooled by the product&#x27;s Brand name, which the FDA does not regulate.  The FDA only requires that the ingredients listed need to be accurate.</li>
    <li> I have been using retinol cream for 2 weeks now, at night.  My face feels great.  I can&#x27;t say the wrinkles are gone but my face feels softer  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> People this is one of the best non prescription retinol creams that I have ever get the chance to use. It has cleared up my spots, and even wrinkles and scars.My skin feels rejuvenated and glowing like it used to .I was such a sufferer of skin problems, this has changed my life!!</li>
    <li> Not with active ingredient.. And oily for my skin. So if u have an oily skin u might consider using it.</li>
    <li> As someone who has taken many pains to even out and clear up my acne-prone skin- the retinol cream has done many wonders. When used regularly it helps to brighten and even out tone. The tea tree oil is great for blemishes. I have yet to find a permanent solution to my skin issues but in the mean time this cream has done wonders to boost the appearance of my skin!</li>
    <li> Great product. Really works. Have used Retinol for years and totally believe in it. Love the blemish roll on it too really works great.</li>
    <li> The blemish stick is great for &amp;#34;in between&amp;#34; use of the pure tree tea oil, but I thought maybe she&#x27;d be able to get away with only using the blemish stick on a wknd. trip and she was broken out by Sunday again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for winter skin, not to oily and works so much better than anything else on the market. I get so dry in some areas and usually right next to were I get oily so if hard to find any cremes that I can usue regularily.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the free tee tree oil stick this stuff smells so good and works well on blemish spots. A really great deal on a couple of my favorite produts, I am going to reorder asap.</li>
    <li> So many reasons I&#x27;m happy with this :-)&lt;br /&gt;1.) I&#x27;m currently living overseas and have items shipped to an APO (military) address.  This item arrived a week before it&#x27;s estimated arrival date! Win!&lt;br /&gt;2.) Super-easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Rich, creamy feeling that does not get oily and does absorb very nicely into the skin (I haven&#x27;t used the Tea Tree stuff, just the Retinol Cream)&lt;br /&gt;4.)  I use this on my face and neck and have noticed definite positive changes in my skin looking and feeling more supple and healthy... and I&#x27;ve only been using it for four days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info:  I&#x27;m using this product in conjunction with two others that I purchased through Amazon, and one product I already had.  I use &amp;#34;Scarguard Scarlight  MD, 0.5 Ounces&amp;#34; morning and evening, after washing my face (for my melanoma).  I apply it only where the dark discolorations are.  I let it set in for several minutes, until it&#x27;s absorbed, and then I apply my moisturizer.  In the morning, I use a L&#x27;oreal moisturizer that contains SPF30.  In the evenings, I use this &amp;#34;Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 Oz.&amp;#34;.  I looove the Retinol Cream - it feels great on my face and neck, not greasy at all and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;I have twice now used &amp;#34;Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs&amp;#34; after washing my face and before doing the Scarguard/moisturizer.  Once I mixed the clay with water, and once with organic apple cider vinegar (the instructions allow for either).  I must say, the vinegar time, I was freaked out for a bit afterward because my skin went Super-Pink!  Like, magenta!  I&#x27;m guessing the vinegar caused that... but, by the next morning my skin was all good again.  I think I&#x27;ll probably mix half water and half vinegar in the future :-)&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I am supremely happy with all three beauty products - Scarguard Scarlight MF, 0.5 Ounces, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs, and Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 Oz, that I purchased on Amazon.  They feel great and I&#x27;m seeing veryquick results!&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I&#x27;m a 30 yr old caucasian with fair skin (blonde, blue eyes...) that does tan but also is prone to freckles and especially to melasma.</li>
    <li> This cream was just a cream. It did not make a difference , but it feels good and I use it as a night cream.</li>
    <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love that this comes with the roll on.  Both products feel good on my sensitive skin and helps with the occasional break outs.</li>
