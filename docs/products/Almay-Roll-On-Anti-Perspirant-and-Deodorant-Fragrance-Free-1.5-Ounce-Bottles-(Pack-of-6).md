      <li>The product is of Good quality.</li>

      <li>LOVE this anti-perspirant!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s handy to be able to order it at a good price from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have worn Almay Fragrance Free Roll-on Deodorant exclusively for a good 12 plus years.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased to see that I could order this item in a package of 6</li>
      <li>so glad Amazon is carrying it now...</li>
      <li>Then I stumbled on the Almay Roll on I love at Amazon</li>
      <li>I have tried many varieties.</li>
      <li>Better price in bulk from amazon and no store to contend with.</li>
      <li>Love it as have used the product for almost 50 years.</li>
      <li>Love this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With a lot of allergies to most every cleaning product and cleansing bar, deodorant and shampoo, I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
      <li>So glad to find the item online as it cannot be found in stores.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>There are abosolutely no stains and also the best part is that it leaves the armpit dry even during summer.</li>
      <li>Almay is famous for being good for sensitive skin, and this product lives up to the Almay reputation.</li>
      <li>Everything was fine.  </li>
      <li>How cheap is that?</li>
      <li>Great product - especially for those with sensitie skin.  </li>
      <li>Perfume free which is a must for me.</li>
      <li>only deodorant on market I can use without rash or break out...can also use the crystal one but that one is not as effective!</li>
      <li>This deodorant works great, stays dry.</li>
      <li>It is the only one that doesn&#x27;t fight with my own body chemistry.</li>
      <li>Thanks Alamay!</li>
      <li>No ill effects.</li>
      <li>It is a little expansive but you will love it!  </li>
      <li>Also, I did not find it as effective as my previous bottle with the updated label.</li>
      <li>I did not notice the label design compared to the one I all ready had at home.  </li>
      <li>This roll-on is not always available in my local stores.</li>
      <li>Love this deodorant, I have sensitive skin and can only use hypoallergenic kinds.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other brands  allergically tested.</li>
      <li>It does not dry, is super sticky, and I broke out in a rash within an hour after application.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, with the first use, my underarms felt sticky and took some time to dry after I had my clothes on.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It is Highly hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>I also did not use it right away because I was using the last of my store bought product</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m about to wash my armpits and go right back to using an Avon roll-on.</li>
      <li>I also have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any inflammation - even just after shaving.</li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
      <li>My impression after using this product with this label is that it is old expired product that has lost its&#x27; effectiveness.</li>
      <li>I put it on for the first time today, and it stayed wet forever!  </li>
      <li>Most deodorants mixed with my sweat cause an obnoxious smell - worse than that of the sweat alone.</li>
      <li>Hard to find but worth looking for ...</li>

<li> I tried at least a dozen other deodorants and had no success.  </li>

<li> Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping this was just a bad batch, but this was so thick and sticky.  </li>

    <li> I highly recommend this product. It is a little expansive but you will love it!  I have been using this brand for a couple of years and it works!</li>
    <li> I was so fed up with the stick deos leaving stains on my shirt and ALmay has come to be a life saver. There are abosolutely no stains and also the best part is that it leaves the armpit dry even during summer. Thanks Alamay!</li>
    <li> The only roll-on I have found that dosent irritate my skin</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! Perfume free which is a must for me. I also have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any inflammation - even just after shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product - especially for those with sensitie skin.  Hard product to find in local stores so Amazon is a great place to stock up!</li>
    <li> Everything was fine.  It took awhile to deliver but I anticipated that because of the weather.</li>
    <li> When this disappeared from all the stores, I was truly unhappy.  I tried at least a dozen other deodorants and had no success.  Then I stumbled on the Almay Roll on I love at Amazon and I was estatic!</li>
    <li> Hard to find but worth looking for ... so glad Amazon is carrying it now... I&#x27;m allergic to everything and this antiperspirant works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely sensitive. I have tried many other brands  allergically tested. None of them has been succesful .</li>
    <li> This deodorant works great, stays dry. My order arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> An old favorite of our family, but almost impossible to find anymore in stores.  The price was nearly double what it used to cost at retail; but If you can only find it here:  How cheap is that?</li>
    <li> The only deodorant I can use</li>
    <li> Our favorite deodorant!</li>
    <li> Great product, been using it for years.  Better price in bulk from amazon and no store to contend with.</li>
    <li> I used this product since 2008 years ago. To me it´s the best anti - perspirant &amp; deodorant product as quality and price.</li>
    <li> only deodorant on market I can use without rash or break out...can also use the crystal one but that one is not as effective!</li>
    <li> Only one star because I cannot do zero stars! The product in the picture is NOT the product you receive. I used the product pictured for years with no problems at all and when it began to disappear from store shelves came to Amazon to stock up. What I received was a shorter more rounded bottle that it is terrible. It does not dry, is super sticky, and I broke out in a rash within an hour after application. I took a chance after reading the reviews that I would get the product pictured- but I did not. I also did not use it right away because I was using the last of my store bought product so I missed the window to return it. I would not recommend that anyone buy this product, the photo you see is NOT what is shipped.</li>
    <li> I have worn Almay Fragrance Free Roll-on Deodorant exclusively for a good 12 plus years. When our local pharmacy stopped stocking the roll-on I turned to Amazon to order this product.  I was so pleased to see that I could order this item in a package of 6 I did not notice the label design compared to the one I all ready had at home.  When all 6 arrived I did notice the label design and the thought did cross my mind that perhaps I may have bought an expired product. Sure enough, with the first use, my underarms felt sticky and took some time to dry after I had my clothes on. Also, I did not find it as effective as my previous bottle with the updated label. I suffered through one bottle and am now on my second and just this morning after my shower I decided to junk the remaining 5.  I checked several websites that carry this product and and one other carried the Almay Roll-on with this label. Could Almay have re-formulated this deodorant? Possibly, but I seriously doubt it. My impression after using this product with this label is that it is old expired product that has lost its&#x27; effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for years. I bought it on-line because the stores were only stocking the Gel, which I do not like.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Highly allergic to fragrances and Almay is one of very few  companies who make unscented deodorants.</li>
    <li> Love it as have used the product for almost 50 years. So glad to find the item online as it cannot be found in stores.</li>
    <li> The product is of Good quality. It is Highly hypoallergenic. It does not stain clothes. I have tried many varieties. This one is the best.</li>
    <li> This roll-on is not always available in my local stores. It&#x27;s handy to be able to order it at a good price from Amazon. Almay is famous for being good for sensitive skin, and this product lives up to the Almay reputation. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant, I have sensitive skin and can only use hypoallergenic kinds. They stop selling the roll on at my local drug stores so finding it on amazon was a plus. Arrived when expected and they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping this was just a bad batch, but this was so thick and sticky.  I put it on for the first time today, and it stayed wet forever!  I kept my arms up so my armpits could dry easier, and 5 minutes later, it seemed promising.&lt;br /&gt;I got dressed, and immediately noticed that I was sticking to my shirt!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to wash my armpits and go right back to using an Avon roll-on.</li>
    <li> LOVE this anti-perspirant! It is the only one that doesn&#x27;t fight with my own body chemistry. Most deodorants mixed with my sweat cause an obnoxious smell - worse than that of the sweat alone. But, this one doesn&#x27;t. I am so happy we found this one!!!</li>
    <li> The Best I&#x27;ve Ever Found!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It protects without breaking me out. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> With a lot of allergies to most every cleaning product and cleansing bar, deodorant and shampoo, I have used this product for years and love it. No ill effects.</li>
