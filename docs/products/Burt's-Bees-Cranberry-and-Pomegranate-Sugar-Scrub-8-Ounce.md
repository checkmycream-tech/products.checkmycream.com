      <li>It leaves my skin super soft, moisturized and smooth.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs before and no good results until now.</li>
      <li>so when you use it, go bare handed or prepare for a red-stained scrub.</li>
      <li>My tub is incredibly slick and won&#x27;t come clean, and the tiny seeds are everywhere.</li>
      <li>The sugar and pomegranate seeds rinsed off fine, but I can&#x27;t say the same to the Crisco like substance it left behind.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The texture is unpleasant, itdoesnt smell particularly good, it leaves an oily residue on skin, and it leaves a mess in the tub. I love most Burt&#x27;s bees products but I just threw this one in the trash.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Cranberry and Pomegranate Sugar Scrub is a wonderfully decadent, thick cranberry-and-pomengranete-filled natural sugar scrub that smells like cranberry candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Cranberry and Pomegranate Sugar Scrub to exfoliate before shaving my legs. It leaves my skin super soft, moisturized and smooth. I find that the scrub doesn&#x27;t melt too quickly in a warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the scrub at Walgreens for ~$5 (on clearance). The jar looks small but isn&#x27;t as a little of the scrub goes a loooong way. I bought it on a whim but I liked it so much I may buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: sucrose, soybean oil, crambe seed oil, silica, corn starch, olive)fruit oil, sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, grape seed oil, shea butter, fragrance, cranberryseed, cranberry fruit juice, pomenegrante seed oil, cranberry fruit powder, honey hydrolyzed soy protein, tocopherol, water, magnesium hydroxide, citric acid, limonene, geraniol</li>
    <li> I would describe as greasy rather than moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love scrubs, but I didn&#x27;t love this one. It smelled nice and sweet, but it was REALLY rough on my skin and didn&#x27;t wash well down the drain. It left chunks of fruit stuck in the crevices of my shower mat. It&#x27;s now collecting dust on my shelf.</li>
    <li> This product works well enough.  It&#x27;s drier than other brands I&#x27;ve tried but still does the trick.  It has a nice aroma.</li>
    <li> this really moistens my skin, must have</li>
    <li> Great product, does what it says! Leaves skin feeling smooth and also smells great. Will definantly recommend it to anyone with dry skin</li>
    <li> I have very fussy skin so hesitate to try even \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products. As I already use some select bits of the Burt&#x27;s Bee line I gave it a try. Wow! My skin felt wonderful after using this scrub and still felt great the next morning. I will be buying this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin and lips silky soft. I&#x27;m in love</li>
    <li> It really feels great on your face and it works.</li>
    <li> While the smell is fantastic and the exfoliation feels nice, I absolutely cannot stand the way my skin feels after I use this product.  It leaves behind a very thick oily film that is extremely difficult to wash off.  I have used this product a few times now, experimenting with use, and have found it is less oily if I combine a scoop of it with a squirt of shower gel/body wash.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This scrub is pretty wonderful for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It isn&#x27;t in a tube. Have you ever had to throw away the last 2-4 ounces in a tube because you couldn&#x27;t get the rest out? What a waste. Yes you have to dip something in, but there are tea spoons you can use if you don&#x27;t want to use your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;2. You don&#x27;t use much. Yes, this is going to leave a coating of oil in the shower if you use it there. Part of what makes scrubs work for our skin is this oil though. You&#x27;re going to be hard pressed finding a scrub that doesn&#x27;t have it. The way you mitigate this is you stand out of the water and put some in your hand and rub it into moist skin until the crystals disappear. The key is you don&#x27;t have to use a ton. It is easy to over estimate because it doesn&#x27;t lather.&lt;br /&gt;3. This is a sugar scrub, not a salt scrub. So it dissolves pretty quick. I don&#x27;t like beauty treatments that take forever. If you are dumping water over it or letting it get too much moisture too quickly then it dissolves faster than it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;4. It smells so tasty, they had to put a &#x27;do not eat&#x27; warning on the label. Yes, it smells good enough to eat. Do not give in to the temptation.&lt;br /&gt;5. So much great moisture for the skin, leaving it hydrated and feeling utterly soft. My elbows really benefited from this.&lt;br /&gt;6. Great for when hair starts to grow back after waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with:&lt;br /&gt;JMT Wax Warmer&lt;br /&gt;Cirepil Blue Wax&lt;br /&gt;Cirepil Ease Wax&lt;br /&gt;GiGi All Purpose Honee (***DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND, TORE OFF MY SKIN AND INTENSELY STICKY)&lt;br /&gt;Johnson&#x27;s Baby Oil w/Aloe &amp; Vit E&lt;br /&gt;JMT Wax Warmer Pots &amp; Lids&lt;br /&gt;JMT Muslin Strips&lt;br /&gt;JMT Square Collars&lt;br /&gt;Wood Craft Sticks&lt;br /&gt;Smaller Popsicle Sticks (For face)&lt;br /&gt;Super Numb Anesthetic Skin Numbing Cream</li>
    <li> This one works! I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs before and no good results until now. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bee Scrub is fabulous. I use it daily only as a facial scrub. I have given it to a number of friends, and will continue to.</li>
    <li> I have bought this before live the scent skin feels so silky smooth</li>
    <li> The smell is delightful!!!!!  I use it on face and rough patches of skin like elbows.  It is definitely a rough scrub because it contains pomegranate seeds, but it is very nice and it also feels moisturizing,</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s a must have. I feel like my skin glows after using this scrub. Plus it smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this scrub for several years, but I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer. When I saw it online for half the price I paid for it in the store, I purchased several jars. I love this sugar scrub, and it makes my skin feel so soft and healthy. I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and works great but it does leave seeds all over the tub.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after I use this item...very soft skin afterwards</li>
    <li> Love this! I had a little sample and used it to give my very pregnant neighbor a pedicure &amp; foot massage. I bought a tub for both of us since it was so wonderful! We both are very happy with the moisturizing, smell, and exfoliation of this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin smooth and feeling silky!  I use it on my upper arms which are horribly bumpy and my feet.  I just wish I could get someone to rub it in for me - then it would be like being at a spa!</li>
    <li> This is the first sugar scrub I&#x27;ve ever tried. I wanted something to use on my skin before applying a tanning cream. I purchased this at the local drug store and see it here online for a lower price. I was just about to place my purchase online to reorder then thought to read the reviews. I purchased the body butter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before reading any other review I thought this was the perfect skin scrub (except for the bits of cranberry and pomegranate left in the tub.) I do wonder if it&#x27;ll clog the drain. But what I did notice more than anything was how fabulous my skin looks afterwards. I mixed a tanning cream with the body butter and truly my skin looks fantastic. My skin felt a bit weird (I guess that&#x27;s what some are calling the &#x27;Crisco&#x27; feeling), but after applying tanning cream my skin feels weird anyway. What I do have to say is the smell is fantastic and counteracts the smell of the tanning cream. Its so nice to have that light tan glow without the tanning cream smell.  That&#x27;s what using the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sugar Scrub and Body Butter does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try another sugar scrub now just to see if it&#x27;s better but I was so happy with my purchase that I&#x27;m reordering right now.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Plus, super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I use this with a Clarisonic Mia and the seeds get stuck in the brush, which is very unfortunate. They&#x27;re very tedious to get out.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother. I don&#x27;t know how well it works but it smells great! I would buy it again as a gift in a minute.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub, use it daily on my feet. I&#x27;m callous free with sandal perfect feet!</li>
    <li> Until now, I&#x27;ve never used a Burt&#x27;s Bees product I didn&#x27;t love. I tried this for the first time this morning, hoping for relief from dry, winter skin. I used it from neck to feet, enjoying the smell, and thought it was working well. As I slipped in the shower when I turned to rinse it off, I realized what a horrible mistake I&#x27;d made. The sugar and pomegranate seeds rinsed off fine, but I can&#x27;t say the same to the Crisco like substance it left behind. All over my body. All over. No amount of scalding hot water would take it off, so I figured another wash with soap might. After several soap uses, I gave up. Mostly because I&#x27;d also used the scrub on my feet and Crisco plus wet shower floors does not end well. After toweling off, I can say that I&#x27;ve been downgraded from a tub of Crisco to a tube of Chapstick (on the plus side, I don&#x27;t have to worry about winter wind burn). It&#x27;s going to take several more showers to get this mess off. If you still insist on trying this product, I can only offer two bits of advice: 1. Use a very, very small amount, like, preferably none at all. 2. DO NOT use it to exfoliate bikini area. There is no feeling worse than that of Crisco Crotch. Now if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I have to attempt to clean the shower floor so I don&#x27;t end up breaking a hip or two.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It does a great body scrub and leaves your skin feeling very moist.  Smells great too</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this sugar scrub.  It feels pretty oily and greasy.  Will use it up for my feet, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> sooo good! really nice smell and cheap here on amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this was terribly disappointing. It doesn&#x27;t smell good and it left a white film all over my body. I couldn&#x27;t wash it off, and I ended up scraping a lot off with my fingernails (as best as I could anyway). I&#x27;ve used other oily sugar scrubs, which left my body feeling soft after towelling off. But this made my skin feel strange and tacky. My tub is incredibly slick and won&#x27;t come clean, and the tiny seeds are everywhere. I wanted to give this a try because it was on sale, but now I wish I&#x27;d just spent the money on the Bath and Body Works scrub I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was pretty terrible. I won&#x27;t even be using the rest of it. What a waste.</li>
    <li> This is everywhere and was highly rated in many fashion magazines, but I&#x27;m not obsessed. It smells great, but it&#x27;s a sugar scrub so when you use it, go bare handed or prepare for a red-stained scrub. Also leaves A MESS all over the shower. The red beads do not dissolve, but melt onto the shower floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells incredible and works effectively, also leaving a waxy seal on your skin. It&#x27;s meant to be moisturizing, but it leaves a residue that is resistant to water and will come off on your towel. Weird experiences using this product. I probably won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
