### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is a wonderful hair product</li>
      <li>I now love my hair!!!</li>
      <li>This is one of two Shea Moisture products that works great on my hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>
      <li>My hair feels &amp; looks great ..</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t dye my hair, It&#x27;s actually gorgeous hair.</li>
      <li>but I appreciate that it&#x27;s has good ingredients and no chemicals.</li>
      <li>Jojoba included).&lt;br /&gt;I put this in my hair, and it was surprisingly slippery.</li>
      <li>Good stuff ..</li>
      <li>I LOVE SHEA MOISTURE!</li>
      <li>and they love it too!</li>
      <li>Works great for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This voluminzing conditioner is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Also smells really nice</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice any volumizing, but it moisturizes and smells nice.</li>
      <li>and I still love how this line helps volumize my hair.</li>
      <li>I love that scent, but that line does nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>and I love this even more.</li>
      <li>I love all of the products from this voluminous line.</li>
      <li>More if I go one month without my hair after I trim/straighten it.</li>
      <li>I had to purchase more for my daughters</li>
      <li>I love all of the Shea Moisture brand and of all the conditioners, this is my all time favorite, along with the thickening shampoo that partners it.</li>
      <li>I wish more people knew and used Shea Moisture because it&#x27;s a really great line - and all natural!</li>
      <li>The shampoo made it easy to comb through with my fingers but this didn&#x27;t give me the manageability I was looking for.</li>
      <li>i tried this product for the first time and i must say the smell is truly amazing,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smelled great like the shampoo but didn&#x27;t offer enough slip.</li>
      <li>Not 4 times in the shower to get my scalp clean and</li>
      <li>In any case, I was really hesitant about purchasing this because most of their products don&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell, its too strong at first</li>
      <li>It looks more normal.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t use it myself but if you have really dry hair or curly hair that needs weight, it would probably be good.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and these products have really improved the volume of my hair.</li>
      <li>I have very curly but fine hair</li>
      <li>I love this line of products to begin with, but it has made a huge different in my hair.</li>
      <li>Since going to my natural state of curly hair after years of blowdrying I tried many products.  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say much HOWEVER!!!</li>
      <li>It smells nice when you apply it to wet hair, but the smell fades quickly as your hair dries.</li>
      <li>I love that there is no harmful stuff in it for me or the environment, but I have found other formulas from this company that work better for my particular hair type.</li>
      <li>First I have to say:</li>
      <li>I noticed some extra volume to my hair also which is a plus for me :)</li>
      <li>Many of which \\&quot;claim\\&quot; to be organic on the Outside, but PLEASE READ the INGREDIENT Portion of the bottles.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It rinsed out easily and left my hair soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super soft.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I see much added volume from this.</li>
      <li>During detangling, I didn&#x27;t lose much hair.</li>
      <li>example, Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo \\&quot;Supposely Oraganic\\&quot; has a LONG list of ingredients, many of which I assume are FAR from Organic.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new LINE!</li>
      <li>Now, I don&#x27;t really have to oil my scalp with certain styles like a braid out, because I moisturize my hair and scalp at the same time thanks to the castor oil.</li>
      <li>My hair is curly with fine strands, is coarse, and highly porous (loses moisture quickly).</li>
      <li>I have latin type of hair, mid length, wavy, semi thick and very Healthy.</li>
      <li>Came quicker than I thought and is doing what it&#x27;s said to do so far.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, but it doesn&#x27;t work against breakage.</li>
      <li>hair needs protein, but not heavy protein, and I couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner with lighter proteins until this one.</li>
      <li>it has helped to thicken my hair, as far as i can tell.</li>
      <li>I like it so far and will eventually give an updated review.</li>
      <li>Non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t buildup as I use this as a leave-in, makes my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
      <li>This leaves my hair soft and we&#x27;ll conditioned.</li>
      <li>Still trying the product but no concerns thus far.</li>
      <li>Buy from TARGET, They are the major supplier of Shea Moisture.</li>
      <li>Most of SM caters to natural black, thick hair</li>
      <li>That is, I generally use a moisturizing conditioner, and I lose a normal amount, but much less with this conditioner.</li>

<li> My only complaint is that the scent is a little too strong for me.</li>
<li> THIS Conditioner, I only have to use HALF to get SILKY SOFT</li>
<li> The ingredient list that someone posted is not complete or maybe they posted ingredients from a different product?</li>
<li> It left my hair dry feeling and not detangled.</li>
<li> Just fyi, I&#x27;m black with 4b/c hair, shoulder length and natural.</li>
<li> Long hairs everywhere</li>
<li> please keep in mind my hair grows just as fast as I lose it, so I still have semi thick hair... but (during the last 2 Days of using Shea Moisture) Only half of the hair came out</li>
<li> Worst of all is the STRONG smell of cheap perfume it has.</li>
<li> I am half white,</li>
<li> In the last few years during my showers I lose a hand ful of hair...</li>
<li> I have unprocessed kinky AA hair.</li>
<li> The other Shea Moisture conditioners I&#x27;ve tried were very dry feeling.</li>
<li> I had tried Jason, among every other product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The other is a shine and hold spray in the line with the pinkish label.</li>
<li> so I am always looking for volume without weighing down my hair.  </li>
<li> half Filipino</li>
<li> or it&#x27;s mess trying to comb my hair out</li>
<li> This is an All Organic brand, that I recently came across because my scalp has been having issues, that has gotten worse in this year to the point of unbarable.</li>
<li> Also, heavy proteins don&#x27;t agree with my hair.</li>
<li> I wish it was scented like the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter line.</li>
<li> I like not love this conditioner.  </li>
<li> Very heavy.</li>
<li> , well recently I noticed that&#x27;s getting a bit TOO thin for comfort, and even a small bald patch!!</li>
<li> so my hair is thick but</li>
<li> No more split ends!</li>
<li> so I would say this is the shampoo and conditioner for people with thin or thick hair</li>
<li> If i stress my hair falls out, and I have semi thick hair, so thank goodness!!</li>
<li> Awful smell...</li>
<li> It smells like a terrible floral lotion or perfume.</li>
<li> The smell is absolutely horrible.  </li>
<li> I have never used a conditioner this horrible.</li>
<li> However, I have terrible scalp issues.</li>

    <li> Came quicker than I thought and is doing what it&#x27;s said to do so far. I like it so far and will eventually give an updated review.</li>
    <li> I love all of the products from this voluminous line. My hair is fine and these products have really improved the volume of my hair. It looks more normal.</li>
    <li> I have never used a conditioner this horrible. I have unprocessed kinky AA hair. It left my hair dry feeling and not detangled. Worst of all is the STRONG smell of cheap perfume it has. I don&#x27;t think the headache this stuff gave me will ever go away. I never return hair products, but this must go back for a refund. The smell is so offensive that I would not use it even if it had worked well on my hair.</li>
    <li> omg omg omg i tried this product for the first time and i must say the smell is truly amazing, both the smell and how it makes my hair feel. it has helped to thicken my hair, as far as i can tell.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair type</li>
    <li> Good stuff .. My hair feels &amp; looks great .. I don&#x27;t like the smell, its too strong at first but I noticed the scent goes away after I rinse it out. I noticed some extra volume to my hair also which is a plus for me :)</li>
    <li> Awful smell... It leaves my hair soft, but it doesn&#x27;t work against breakage.</li>
    <li> I love this line of products to begin with, but it has made a huge different in my hair. It&#x27;s super soft. My only complaint is that the scent is a little too strong for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any volumizing, but it moisturizes and smells nice. Non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t buildup as I use this as a leave-in, makes my hair soft and bouncy. Just fyi, I&#x27;m black with 4b/c hair, shoulder length and natural. I need to use quite a bit, so I added jbco (castor oil) and I love this even more. Now, I don&#x27;t really have to oil my scalp with certain styles like a braid out, because I moisturize my hair and scalp at the same time thanks to the castor oil. I wash every 2 weeks and use this almost daily so a bottle lasts me a month. More if I go one month without my hair after I trim/straighten it.</li>
    <li> Since going to my natural state of curly hair after years of blowdrying I tried many products.  This voluminzing conditioner is amazing.  I have very curly but fine hair so I am always looking for volume without weighing down my hair.  This does the trick.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair soft and we&#x27;ll conditioned.</li>
    <li> Still trying the product but no concerns thus far.</li>
    <li> The smell is absolutely horrible.  Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> No more split ends! Awesom product! I had to purchase more for my daughters and they love it too! Also smells really nice</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful hair product</li>
    <li> I love that there is no harmful stuff in it for me or the environment, but I have found other formulas from this company that work better for my particular hair type. I plan to stick with this brand for my shampoo and conditioners.</li>
    <li> if your hair is thinning this is the stuff to purchase. For your hair will increse in vulumes as promised.</li>
    <li> My daughter turned me onto this product.  I now love my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Very heavy. I didn&#x27;t like this at all but I appreciate that it&#x27;s has good ingredients and no chemicals. I won&#x27;t use it myself but if you have really dry hair or curly hair that needs weight, it would probably be good. I actually wash &amp; condition my dog with it now and it works great.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Shea Moisture brand and of all the conditioners, this is my all time favorite, along with the thickening shampoo that partners it. Most of SM caters to natural black, thick hair so I would say this is the shampoo and conditioner for people with thin or thick hair but definitely people without course hair. I am half white, half Filipino so my hair is thick but not course and I still love how this line helps volumize my hair. I wish more people knew and used Shea Moisture because it&#x27;s a really great line - and all natural!</li>
    <li> This is one of two Shea Moisture products that works great on my hair. The other is a shine and hold spray in the line with the pinkish label. In any case, I was really hesitant about purchasing this because most of their products don&#x27;t work on my hair. Let me start by saying that it doesn&#x27;t matter  what ethnic background you come from, it matters what type of hair you have. My hair is curly with fine strands, is coarse, and highly porous (loses moisture quickly). Also, heavy proteins don&#x27;t agree with my hair. The ingredient list that someone posted is not complete or maybe they posted ingredients from a different product? This conditioner has several moisturizing alcohols, veggie protein, rice protein, shea butter, and oils (Jojoba included).&lt;br /&gt;I put this in my hair, and it was surprisingly slippery. The other Shea Moisture conditioners I&#x27;ve tried were very dry feeling. I used this one to detangle, and then left it in for some deep conditioning. During detangling, I didn&#x27;t lose much hair. That is, I generally use a moisturizing conditioner, and I lose a normal amount, but much less with this conditioner. It rinsed out easily and left my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;My hair needs protein, but not heavy protein, and I couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner with lighter proteins until this one. So I will alternate this conditioner with a moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this four stars because the scent is just, ugh! I don&#x27;t like it. It smells like a terrible floral lotion or perfume. I wish it was scented like the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter line. I love that scent, but that line does nothing for my hair. I will still repurchase and use hoping that they will change the scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Not too heavy, but really smooths and conditions my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Well packaged to prevent breaking or leaking.  Works great for fine hair.  Would use product and seller again.</li>
    <li> First I have to say: Buy from TARGET, They are the major supplier of Shea Moisture. This is an All Organic brand, that I recently came across because my scalp has been having issues, that has gotten worse in this year to the point of unbarable. I started shopping around for organic products. Many of which \\&quot;claim\\&quot; to be organic on the Outside, but PLEASE READ the INGREDIENT Portion of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo \\&quot;Supposely Oraganic\\&quot; has a LONG list of ingredients, many of which I assume are FAR from Organic.&lt;br /&gt;Well I had tried Jason, among every other product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Korean &amp; Puertorican... I have latin type of hair, mid length, wavy, semi thick and very Healthy. I have no split ends, I don&#x27;t dye my hair, It&#x27;s actually gorgeous hair. However, I have terrible scalp issues. If i stress my hair falls out, and I have semi thick hair, so thank goodness!! Or I would be hairless, because my hair falls all over the place!! Long hairs everywhere, well recently I noticed that&#x27;s getting a bit TOO thin for comfort, and even a small bald patch!! From Stress! I work over 70 + hours in sales and raising a child!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally tried organic Shea Moisture! I need \\&quot;lots\\&quot; of conditioner or it&#x27;s mess trying to comb my hair out, I didn&#x27;t think this ORGANIC stuff would do the trick. But It&#x27;s been day 2, so I really can&#x27;t say much HOWEVER!!! In the last few years during my showers I lose a hand ful of hair... please keep in mind my hair grows just as fast as I lose it, so I still have semi thick hair... but (during the last 2 Days of using Shea Moisture) Only half of the hair came out, I am taking that as a sign that YES this Organic stuff rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in ADDITION, My head is not sore, I only have to wash it ONCE! Not 4 times in the shower to get my scalp clean and THIS Conditioner, I only have to use HALF to get SILKY SOFT &amp; I happen to LIKE the smell! I LOVE SHEA MOISTURE! It&#x27;s my new LINE! I will try to keep everyone updated.ne updated.</li>
    <li> It smells nice when you apply it to wet hair, but the smell fades quickly as your hair dries. I only use it on the bottom inch or so of my hair. I can&#x27;t say I see much added volume from this.</li>
    <li> I like not love this conditioner.  It&#x27;s smelled great like the shampoo but didn&#x27;t offer enough slip. The shampoo made it easy to comb through with my fingers but this didn&#x27;t give me the manageability I was looking for.</li>
