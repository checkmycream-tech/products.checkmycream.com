      <li>It is really great stuff!</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>My Mom let me try hers when we did my hair for a friend&#x27;s wedding, and I literally had the best hair day of my life.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Happy amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>Best pin-straight hair product I&#x27;ve ever found, of the many I have tried.  </li>
      <li>did not expect this kind of packaging..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good for my fine medium curly hair.</li>
      <li>and my hair shrinks up more.</li>
      <li>I have more frizz</li>
      <li>I love Giovianni shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s a better deal for the three packs.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this stuff again.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>We immediately fell in love with this product.</li>
      <li>This smooths the hair and I use it mostly in the summer for my curly hair.</li>
      <li>I found this gel at a discount store and liked it so much I searched all over the place to buy more.  </li>
      <li>It helps elongate my curls and keeps the ends frizz free</li>
      <li>My hair is so smooth and silky without being greasy.</li>
      <li>Keeps the softness in your hair and really leaves a nice shine.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for flat ironing your hair.</li>
      <li>Works beautifully (and I have curly hair but want straight hair without flat ironing), and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like most products.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love, and will definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>I used it years ago and liked it, but have not been able to find anywhere locally.</li>
      <li>I do use this with other products and I am happy with how it smooths out my hair.</li>
      <li>so it works great for me because there is NO crunch like other gels and mousses.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my scalp and protected my hair from the high heat setting on my iron.</li>
      <li>Worth the investment.</li>
      <li>quite frankly it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I still use it though because it has a nice odor and acts like simply fixing hair gel.</li>
      <li>It jus defrosted it nicely and you only need a smidge.</li>
      <li>it had such a great look and was the only product I used... now...</li>
      <li>I thought that by using this product that I would be able to flat iron my hair with no issues.</li>
      <li>I purchased this gel for my boyfriend who was trying to get away from gels that have so many chemicals and dry out his hair.</li>
      <li>blowdry for awhile, put some more in, and so on and so forth until my hair is dry.</li>
      <li>Even though this says its a &amp;#34;straightening elixir&amp;#34; we tried it anyway at a whole foods market.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, or really I don&#x27;t know if it worked at all</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and needed something to keep my hair manageable throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Nothing will keep my hair straight in the summer humidity, but this gel does help a lot.</li>
      <li>I have to use a VERY generous amount, but it works well.</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using it really...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers not just this product, but also others of the same line.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find anything to keep my thick wavy hair looking good in the humid Summer.</li>
      <li>My hair is not stick straight but with the above combination, my hair is silky, bouncy clean and not frizzy anymore.</li>
      <li>I was liking this product over other brands that were&#x27;t as healthy.</li>
      <li>It makes it so soft and I have so many less tangles.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than similar more expensive products (Biolage causes buildup and Frederic Fekkai did nothing for me) with even better results.</li>
      <li>At first when my hair was damp it made my roots look oily and stringy but after blow drying and straightening with a flat iron</li>
      <li>If I blow dry my hair straight and use this I only use a tiny bit on the ends to keep them smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had no luck with products that claim to be able to maintain my thick, wavy, frizzy, untamed hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really straighten by itself, but used before flat ironing it, it gives protection to the hair strands and gives some shine.</li>
      <li>No fragrance, no strange waxy film on your hair...nice and soft texture!</li>
      <li>It just seems to disappear once you blow dry your hair, and it helps keep my hair fairly straight.  </li>
      <li>It is also the only product so far that keeps my hair consistently soft in my mountain desert home.</li>
      <li>as per the product information on the site, its actually not as it says.. completely dissatisfied..</li>
      <li>It left his hair soft, not hard and flaky like the other non-natural brands, and his hair was shiny and sleek.</li>
      <li>It seems to help with frizz if just used on damp hair and leaving it dry naturally tho.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s definitely smoother and less tangly thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>This could make ur hair a little greasy if you use too much or use it on the roots.</li>
      <li>This was ok but a little thick for my hair...</li>

    <li> I purchased this gel to straighten my hair. Didn&#x27;t work. I followed every step, and my hair looks the same. I still use it though because it has a nice odor and acts like simply fixing hair gel.</li>
    <li> I love Giovianni shampoo and conditioner.  This was ok but a little thick for my hair...took a long time to dry too.  I gave it to my mom who has very thin hair.  I prefer chi.</li>
    <li> I found this product at a grocery store and figured I would try it. I&#x27;ve had no luck with products that claim to be able to maintain my thick, wavy, frizzy, untamed hair. Until I tried this. I do think it&#x27;s a little pricey but quite frankly it&#x27;s worth it. If you have hair like mine TRY IT. I spread a quarter-size through the bottom half of my wet hair and then blow dry a little to help it absorb into the strands. When I am in a hurry and have to blow-dry and then straighten I will put some in, blowdry for awhile, put some more in, and so on and so forth until my hair is dry. It makes it so soft and I have so many less tangles. I straighten my hair everyday and it&#x27;s definitely smoother and less tangly thanks to this product. You can even use it on dry hair, though of course in a slightly smaller amount. Love, love, love, and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I actually use this for CURLY hair. Couldn&#x27;t find anything to keep my thick wavy hair looking good in the humid Summer. My Mom let me try hers when we did my hair for a friend&#x27;s wedding, and I literally had the best hair day of my life. Now I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for flat ironing your hair. No fragrance, no strange waxy film on your hair...nice and soft texture! At first when my hair was damp it made my roots look oily and stringy but after blow drying and straightening with a flat iron the weird oily sheen and texture disappears - instead I have professional quality flat ironed hair with no split ends or harsh burning smell. Keeps the softness in your hair and really leaves a nice shine. I love that it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my scalp and protected my hair from the high heat setting on my iron. Much cheaper than similar more expensive products (Biolage causes buildup and Frederic Fekkai did nothing for me) with even better results.</li>
    <li> I use it to define my curls (African America Type 4a/b hair). I have to use a VERY generous amount, but it works well. It is also the only product so far that keeps my hair consistently soft in my mountain desert home.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gel for my boyfriend who was trying to get away from gels that have so many chemicals and dry out his hair. Even though this says its a &amp;#34;straightening elixir&amp;#34; we tried it anyway at a whole foods market. We immediately fell in love with this product. It left his hair soft, not hard and flaky like the other non-natural brands, and his hair was shiny and sleek. He is now hooked and the fact that it &amp;#34;straightens&amp;#34;...well we never noticed a thing. We were afraid it may make his hair pin straight but it didn&#x27;t. It jus defrosted it nicely and you only need a smidge. It&#x27;s slightly cheaper here on Amazon and there&#x27;s a better deal for the three packs. Worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, or really I don&#x27;t know if it worked at all, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using it really...but I don&#x27;t blowdry my hair often. It seems to help with frizz if just used on damp hair and leaving it dry naturally tho.</li>
    <li> Best pin-straight hair product I&#x27;ve ever found, of the many I have tried.  Works beautifully (and I have curly hair but want straight hair without flat ironing), and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like most products.</li>
    <li> there must have been a change since the last time I bought &amp;#34;Straight fast&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It still &#x27;works&#x27; but not like it used to -  it had such a great look and was the only product I used... now... not so...&lt;br /&gt;:(&lt;br /&gt;plus this time I bought a two pack hoping to not run out for a long time, since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I have chemical sensitivity and this doesn&#x27;t bother me. Plus it only takes a tiny bit and goes a long way. My hair is so smooth and silky without being greasy. I got 2 bottles and it looks like it will last forever. Ended up giving 1 to my daughter.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this stuff again. I used it years ago and liked it, but have not been able to find anywhere locally. Happy amazon carries it. This smooths the hair and I use it mostly in the summer for my curly hair. It helps elongate my curls and keeps the ends frizz free which I always have a problem with. I do use this with other products and I am happy with how it smooths out my hair. I definitely notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it. I have more frizz and my hair shrinks up more. This could make ur hair a little greasy if you use too much or use it on the roots. I sometimes like the wetter hair look for the summer anyway so it works great for me because there is NO crunch like other gels and mousses. If I blow dry my hair straight and use this I only use a tiny bit on the ends to keep them smooth. It is really great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a good number of straightening products, and this is one of the worst ones.  It just does not work on medium curly hair.</li>
    <li> I was liking this product over other brands that were&#x27;t as healthy. I thought that by using this product that I would be able to flat iron my hair with no issues. However, I did develop frizzy and fried hair eventually after months of use.  So I stopped using this product and stopped straightening my hair. I now use the 50:50 shampoo and silky conditioner by the same maker and frizz be gone all by Giovanni and do not straighten my hair. My hair is not stick straight but with the above combination, my hair is silky, bouncy clean and not frizzy anymore.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I keep going back to it. It helps tame my wavy hair and makes it manageable.</li>
    <li> the package was received was not upto my mark. the tube inside the packet was half squeezed and the product was oozing out. did not expect this kind of packaging.. as per the product information on the site, its actually not as it says.. completely dissatisfied..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for my fine medium curly hair. I love this product. I tried another products when this one finished and never was the same. So, I bought it again.</li>
    <li> I found this gel at a discount store and liked it so much I searched all over the place to buy more.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers not just this product, but also others of the same line.  I have very curly hair and needed something to keep my hair manageable throughout the day.  The gel doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky.  It just seems to disappear once you blow dry your hair, and it helps keep my hair fairly straight.  It works wonders during the cold months.  Nothing will keep my hair straight in the summer humidity, but this gel does help a lot.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time and have used for years. It doesn&#x27;t really straighten by itself, but used before flat ironing it, it gives protection to the hair strands and gives some shine.</li>
