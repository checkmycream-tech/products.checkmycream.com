      <li>I saw wonderful reviews about this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I have dermatitis and this is just the best nonprescription item I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>this product was on of the best non-perscription creams we have found.  </li>
      <li>but DO think it is an excellent product to help</li>
      <li>I was very happy with that.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product!  </li>
      <li>I am so impressed with the product.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>We are happy with everything to do with this product and the store that sells it.</li>
      <li>But for what I have it works great.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>It worked great to control her outbreak.  </li>
      <li>works great.</li>
      <li>My son suffered from eczema and i am happy with the results after application of this product.</li>
      <li>Great results.</li>
      <li>and this combo seems to work the best :)</li>
      <li>The shipping was good, and the product arrived at our house in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>and this has not been good at treating that</li>
      <li>This product worked amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I break out every summer and this creme works amazing</li>
      <li>I contacted Amazon customer service and spoke with Maurice B. who was extremely courteous, polite and helpful.  </li>
      <li>I still us Emu oil or Rose oil as well at bedtime-</li>
      <li>I can tell you honestly after a couple of applications this does not irritate or enrage my skin at all.</li>
      <li>This product is well absorbed and is a great face cream, not too greasy or sticky.</li>
      <li>This cream makes the appearance of the skin much better...  </li>
      <li>so the best thing to do is keep looking for what will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and if any of you actually have some recommendations for my condition, be a friend and pass that info along.</li>
      <li>so I need one more bottle.</li>
      <li>here is the information about their company on the Better Business Buereau.  </li>
      <li>and this works better than over the counter cortisone</li>
      <li>It rubs into the skin well, without staying on top of the skin.</li>
      <li>I will keep using and considering to buy more soon.</li>
      <li>She used it on my grandaughter and her eczema got better.  </li>
      <li>My daughter just asked me to order more Eczemaderm.  </li>
      <li>I truly hope more people will find this product and give it a try.</li>
      <li>I was even more puzzled when I saw it says \\&quot;Item weight:2.2 ounces; shipping weight:</li>
      <li>My exczema is much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure their experience was valid-</li>
      <li>I thought with their website testimonies that it would be better than what&#x27;s out there.</li>
      <li>: I continued to use this (each morning/night)- JUST on my forehead, and still, it helped keep it at bay MOST of the time.</li>
      <li>Very happy :)  UPDATE (2yrs later)</li>
      <li>I guess I should have known better.</li>
      <li>We used it on the more severe areas in place of hydrocortisone cream.</li>
      <li>My daughter has eczema, I would try anything to help her feel better.</li>
      <li>Shipping and handling was great, fast and reliable.</li>
      <li>Great product for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this because of not being able to find anything else that has been available for severe eczema breakouts.</li>
      <li>know that they are not backing their claim for a FULL REFUND at any time!</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m ordering more of this again and hoping it helps like it did originally.</li>
      <li>but I have to soak my skin in cool water, then put this stuff on, then more moisturizing stuff over this stuff...</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s fine-</li>
      <li>I was given this product free for writing a review.</li>
      <li>My husband ordered powdered caffeine and the seller messaged and offered another of their products FREE if we would write a review for the caffeine.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to say that I have finally found a product and it is called Eczemaderm.  </li>
      <li>we found it to be better than many of the percription high dollar creams</li>
      <li>and I pretty much got it under control with a good regimen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, absorbs quickly..</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything for my severe eczema - it might work with people with very light eczema who need a light creme, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>It was as effective as any cream so far!</li>
      <li>There is nothing special about this cream.</li>
      <li>My Eczema was becoming pretty severe</li>
      <li>This product has already started to heal my skin in tremendous ways.</li>
      <li>After using it, I realized that the over-the-counter products that I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with, actually worked better.</li>
      <li>I tried many different products that were safe for children and nothing would work.  </li>
      <li>Did I mention my eczema is mild?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this new cream for well over a month- and not had to use my prescription ONCE!!!!</li>
      <li>This cream is not greasy it absorbs into the skin and the healing can be seen the very first night.</li>
      <li>It is not a thick oily cream, instead it goes on smoothly (which is a benefit when putting on eyelids!)</li>
      <li>It moisturizes lightly leaving skin soft and smooth and fragrance free.</li>
      <li>product is marginally effective  but has a long way to go to match the results of exzerderm, which is no longer available ???????</li>
      <li>The cream absorbs very quickly but doesn&#x27;t feel like it moisturizes too much.  </li>
      <li>and I apply it daily to prevent the outbreaks I love it!</li>
      <li>&quot; So I keep using it in hopes of getting results and my money&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>Warning I would not buy this or even use it if it was for free!!!, waste of time,money and hope.</li>
      <li>As of right now, there is no one-stop-shop miracle drug out there</li>
      <li>This cream is quite effective for his dry skin spots.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>First off, I wanted to like this product because it wasn&#x27;t greasy and no odor can be detected once it dries.</li>
      <li>is my first buy of this product.</li>
      <li>Even after applying the cream consistently, I did not experience any improvement.</li>
      <li>did notice that many of the glowing reviews for this product come from either one-review wonders or people who have written two reviews (maybe because word got around that only one review looked</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had finger tip exzema for about a year and this is the first item that has helped the problem.</li>
      <li>First off I want to say that their product is BS.</li>
      <li>Tried eczemaderm after reading some of the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>but so far this winter have experienced only very mild itching a few times and NO signs of eczema outbreak.  </li>
      <li>In about a week the eczema was pretty much gone.  </li>
      <li>I have my fingers crossed as I have seen a lot of other great reviews, but know that everyone&#x27;s body is different.</li>
      <li>this product is pretty good considering that you&#x27;ll have to wait at least 2-3 days until the results will show.</li>
      <li>I would strongly think twice about it, because if you want to get your money back?</li>
      <li>I have tried this on eczema that was caused by eating certain foods.  </li>
      <li>It is a teeny tiny bottle and the consistency is smooth.</li>
      <li>eczema cream did not work, visit dermatologist and get a real prescription, went away in two weeks.</li>
      <li>Lightning fast shipment.</li>
      <li>After searching google, I came across Eczemaderm and decided to try it as it looked promising.  </li>
      <li>it HAS been very helpful in</li>
      <li>very dissapointed</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I have severe eczema, but I do have some moderate breakouts on my hands (mostly on my fingers) and some near the scalp of my forehead.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get along without this wonderful product!  I have dermatitis and this is just the best nonprescription item I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Have used several jars and will keep buying it. I have severe eczema on both cheekbones, produced by contact with dryer sheets which my wife placed in the pillow. Eczemaderm does not cure it but keeps it in check so the eczema is not too obvious and does not itch or peel very much. This product is well absorbed and is a great face cream, not too greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a week now.  The cream absorbs very quickly but doesn&#x27;t feel like it moisturizes too much.  For me, the worst part of my excema is the exessive dry and flakey skin on my hands.  This cream makes the appearance of the skin much better...  meaning it doesn&#x27;t look as gross as it did, but the skin is still very hard and cracking in some places.  I will continue to use and hope that maybe it will take longer for me.  I mean, the hands are a tough spot since they are in contact with so many things all day.  I have my fingers crossed as I have seen a lot of other great reviews, but know that everyone&#x27;s body is different.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazine. works great. will definitely buy again. thank you. cant wait to try it on another person I know with exema</li>
    <li> I was a little bit disappointed when I saw the tiny little bottle. I was even more puzzled when I saw it says \\&quot;Item weight:2.2 ounces; shipping weight: 1.3ounces (December 12th)\\&quot;. I assumed this may be the very confuzing reasong for the product coming as a very small jar.</li>
    <li> We viewed this product on the Amazon site.  It showed a price of $29.99 and in parentheses (8.51 per ounce) which indicates a size of 3.5 ounces.  On the item product description page, it also showed 3.5 ounces.  When I received the product, it was a 1.0 ounce container which is not what I ordered.  I contacted Amazon customer service and spoke with Maurice B. who was extremely courteous, polite and helpful.  He resolved the problem to my satisfaction.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> I have just recently ordered my second batch of Eczemaderm.  I am so impressed with the product.  I have suffered with eczema my whole life and have had mixed results with a number of different products.  I have always searched for a natural and non-steroidal product that works.  I am happy to say that I have finally found a product and it is called Eczemaderm.  My three year old son also suffers from eczema on his face and I have begun using the product on him.  His eczema has improved dramatically in just a few days.  I truly hope more people will find this product and give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this product during a major flare up, hoping it would help offer some natural relief. NONE! Used it for several days and no relief at all. The product is so tiny. I was almost out by weeks end. I guess I should have known better. The company&#x27;s website is all words and no actual pictures of people who have had success with the product. Save your money and try something else.</li>
    <li> this product is pretty good considering that you&#x27;ll have to wait at least 2-3 days until the results will show. That&#x27;s what I did and I started seeing the results on one of my twins legs but the bottle was so small I had almost nothing left! very dissapointed but if you put the cream in a bigger bottle i&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about this cream. The amount they give you is very small and the cream separates between uses. it is nothing but a greasy mess. it smells horrible and has not helped any more than regular petroleum jelly</li>
    <li> This is not actually a review for the product.  Went to dermatologist who suggested applying vegetable shortening on affected areas after showering.  It was as effective as any cream so far!</li>
    <li> I used this as instructed on my eczema. I have several areas on my arms and legs, so I&#x27;ve been using different creams, lotions, potions..to try and calm these areas down. I use a makeup spatula with this stuff, to limit the potential for contamination. It isn&#x27;t very thick and I think it could be put in a different dispenser.  It doesn&#x27;t require much, so I believe it will last a long, long time.. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, absorbs quickly..but I have to soak my skin in cool water, then put this stuff on, then more moisturizing stuff over this stuff...then put cotton gloves in an attempt to get enough moisture retention to the affected areas..I have had to return to using prescription medications for control the flareups..I purchased this because it is promoted as an effective alternative to the very expensive prescription medications.</li>
    <li> First off I want to say that their product is BS. I thought with their website testimonies that it would be better than what&#x27;s out there. I was wrong!! I have tried it for over a month and decided that it didn&#x27;t work for me. I emailed them since their phone number has been disconnected....NO REPLY! I then emailed a few more times expressing my disappointment in them not getting back to me in a timely manner and that it was bad for their business for not taking customer refunds as serious as their sales. After my 4th emailed sent and you guess it...NO RESPONSE back! I&#x27;ve decided to let all links related to Eczemaderm know that they are not backing their claim for a FULL REFUND at any time! I still haven&#x27;t gotten my refund! If you consider buying from them? I would strongly think twice about it, because if you want to get your money back? You may have a problem. I&#x27;m going to contact my credit card company and also report to the BBB on them!    DON&#x27;T BUY FROM THEM!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of not being able to find anything else that has been available for severe eczema breakouts. Warning I would not buy this or even use it if it was for free!!!, waste of time,money and hope.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I have severe eczema, but I do have some moderate breakouts on my hands (mostly on my fingers) and some near the scalp of my forehead. I have taken the steroid creams in the past and realized that while somewhat effective, it thinned out my skin, leaving me in search of other remedies. I saw wonderful reviews about this product and decided to give it a try. I rushed to apply the cream as soon as it arrived but it did none of the things it claimed. It left my skin oily and itchy, with no relief. Even after applying the cream consistently, I did not experience any improvement. Now with that said, just because it didn&#x27;t work for me, it might not mean that it doesn&#x27;t work for you. This product is pretty pricey ($30) for a very small container amount, but you may decide it&#x27;s worth the try. I would just advise to keep your expectations at a minimum if you do decide to use it.</li>
    <li> I suddenly broke out in eczema at 34yrs old! No clue why- not even the derm could figure it out- just said it sometimes happens with people that are prone to it. I&#x27;ve tried every cream, oil etc I could find that might help... and I pretty much got it under control with a good regimen. But STILL had to use the prescription every week or so to keep it in check and help with breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using this new cream for well over a month- and not had to use my prescription ONCE!!!! I will occassionally still get a small little breakout- but put some extra on at night, and pretty much gone the next day! I only break out on my forehead... so it&#x27;s not severe. Not sure how this might work on someone with worse breakout or on a larger area? But for what I have it works great. I still us Emu oil or Rose oil as well at bedtime- otherwise my skin get&#x27;s too dry- but that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been using for months along with other creams etc and this combo seems to work the best :) Hope it continues to do well!!! Very happy :)  UPDATE (2yrs later): I continued to use this (each morning/night)- JUST on my forehead, and still, it helped keep it at bay MOST of the time. Every few months, I&#x27;d have a little breakout- and have to use my RX again. But that&#x27;s fine- least it&#x27;s not daily. I finally stopped using it- as it seemed well under control several months back. Then suddenly (maybe because I tried a new oil?) I broke out BAD again- all over my forehead in small red bumps. I&#x27;ve had to use my RX again- every night to even keep it somewhat under control. But still. ERG! So, I&#x27;m ordering more of this again and hoping it helps like it did originally. I never personally experienced the order issues (and I ordered several times) like one user found. I&#x27;m sure their experience was valid- I&#x27;ve been there with other companies. Hopefully I never have an issue with this one though- cause I know it works for me.</li>
    <li> First of all this is quite expensive for 1 oz.  If it actually worked, I wouldn&#x27;t be quite as concerned about the price.  I have tried this on eczema that was caused by eating certain foods.  It did not help with the itching, nor did it help clear it up.  Not wanting to waste it, I gave it to someone with eczema on their hands that is not caused by eating certain foods.  It did not help them at all either.</li>
    <li> I think that this is a product meant as an alternative to steroid creams, but I just wanted something strong and specialized to actually work, as the over-the-counter steroid creams, which I&#x27;ve tried so far, do not work so well for me. Eczemaderm does clear the redness immediately upon application, but that lasts only for a few seconds and does not help at all in the long-term. Plus the jar is too small and the amount you get for the price is simply too little. After using it, I realized that the over-the-counter products that I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with, actually worked better. So I would definitely go back to using those and not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help with the painful eczema on my hands. I used it for two weeks and it did not help a bit. It was expensive, I bought it directly from the company with a promise on their website for a full refund if not completly happy. They have not responded to three emails. They don&#x27;t have a phone # or address. I FEEL LIKE I WAS RIPPED OFF!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it worked because I used it in addition to other products. My exczema is much better. It is a teeny tiny bottle and the consistency is smooth.</li>
    <li> I agree that this is a blessing find.  My feet and hands were both cracked and red and sore to the touch,very unsightly and uncomfortable. This cream is not greasy it absorbs into the skin and the healing can be seen the very first night.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Has definitely helped me a lot</li>
    <li> I just received this so I am not reviewing the effectiveness of the cream but warning others that the jar I received was not the same as pictured and it was much smaller then expected. I see now that the shipping weight is just over 2 oz but the jar is only 1oz.... it came in a box with lots of other stuff so I&#x27;m not sure how they decide how much the shipping weight is! I am still deciding if I will send it back at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More latter if I keep the cream.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have gone nuts trying to find a product to keep our baby&#x27;s eczema under control, and we tried this product too -- along with just about everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the most expensive product by weight that we tried. (Note that this comes in a tiny, tiny little jar.) It also struck us as the least effective. It was almost like using nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that many of the glowing reviews for this product come from either one-review wonders or people who have written two reviews (maybe because word got around that only one review looked bad?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cave emptor, as they used to say.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve known from the bootleg bottle that was shipped to me that it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but I spent the money so I said \\&quot;hey why not give it a try?\\&quot; So I keep using it in hopes of getting results and my money&#x27;s worth but I have not. Did I mention my eczema is mild? Save your money and buy something known like Dematop (prescription) or cortizone cream for eczema (over the counter). This my friends did not do a damn thing to help heal my eczema. :(</li>
    <li> First off, I wanted to like this product because it wasn&#x27;t greasy and no odor can be detected once it dries. I started putting them on my hands, directly upon the blisters (I have Dyshidrotic Eczema, basically itchy blisters show up on my hands and feet), for three days, 3x a day. Unfortunately, my condition worsened and I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t prevent this review from purchasing it. Different people with different eczema conditions require different medications. As of right now, there is no one-stop-shop miracle drug out there so the best thing to do is keep looking for what will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and if any of you actually have some recommendations for my condition, be a friend and pass that info along. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My daughter just asked me to order more Eczemaderm.  She used it on my grandaughter and her eczema got better.  When she ran out, she switched to a petroleum based product recommended by her doctor and it got worse. So back to Eczemaderm.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered powdered caffeine and the seller messaged and offered another of their products FREE if we would write a review for the caffeine.  I chose this Eczemaderm because myself and several of our children have eczema that often results in a dependence on steroid creams to get us through the winters.&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleasantly surprised!  I was expecting when it arrived so not keen on using the steroid cream.  I also know our eczema is often exacerbated by dairy intake.  I had an active outbreak when it came and while it did NOT help to clear that (and I had to resort to the steroid) it HAS been very helpful in **preventing** an outbreak this winter!!!  AND I have been having more dairy than usual for me.&lt;br /&gt;So, I don&#x27;t necessarily believe the claim that is a helpful *treatment* for eczema but DO think it is an excellent product to help *prevent* it.  I usually get horrible patches under my arms and on the top of my hips in the winter (where the soap runs down my body) but so far this winter have experienced only very mild itching a few times and NO signs of eczema outbreak.  I apply on my hips after I shower and that&#x27;s IT.&lt;br /&gt;With our 2yo, the skin where her earlobe meets her head literally SPLITS and opens wide up and this has not been good at treating that but now that it is cleared up, I have used it on her as a prevention and it has not come back.</li>
    <li> Great results. My son suffered from eczema and i am happy with the results after application of this product.I will highly recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This product has already started to heal my skin in tremendous ways. My Eczema was becoming pretty severe so I was hoping that my order would arrive sooner rather than later. It arrived in 2 days. I was very happy with that.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!  I have an 8 month old that had eczema on most of her body, it was very bad and I was at the point I did not know what to do.  I tried many different products that were safe for children and nothing would work.  After searching google, I came across Eczemaderm and decided to try it as it looked promising.  After applying it to my daughter I seen an improvement almost immediately.  The cream has a very different texture compared to other products I have used.  In about a week the eczema was pretty much gone.  Thank-you Eczemaderm!</li>
    <li> Because I ordered another product from Zyloo I was given this product free for writing a review. This is my first time for being selected for anything like this, totally cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this cream as my product to review as I have a patch of skin on my body that does not respond to anything else I have tried. In fact most creams and lotions just irritate it and make it worse. I can tell you honestly after a couple of applications this does not irritate or enrage my skin at all. It is actually quite soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too soon to say if Eczemaderm will completely clear up this patch, I will follow up as I use the product. I will say the itch is completely gone, and that alone has been a relief.</li>
    <li> Not only is this an expensive product, but you only get an ounce of it. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my severe eczema - it might work with people with very light eczema who need a light creme, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me. It was an expensive lesson.</li>
    <li> I bought this ointment for my eczema on my fingers. Unfortunately, the cream was not working on my problem. My eczema did not change. It does not mean anything. The product may work on anyone others problem. Shipping and handling was great, fast and reliable.</li>
    <li> Tried eczemaderm after reading some of the positive reviews.  Have used it for the past three weeks without much success.  While it does help with the itching, it does not clear up the eczema.  Will look for something else.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema, I would try anything to help her feel better. So I bought this cream for her to try, it didn&#x27;t help a bit. The jar is extremely small, the cream looks like a layer of oil and then white cream, looks like they don&#x27;t mix well. I don&#x27;t know if it meant to be that way. White cream isn&#x27;t solid looking. Overall I used it on my daughter for 2 weeks and it didn&#x27;t help, so I suggest people who want to buy this product not to waste money on this.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my inner arms, inner thighs and inner torso. Eczemaderm only sells this product in a tiny 1 oz jar. This small supply lasted me only 3 days and I saw no signs of improvement with my eczema at all. It is very expensive and the amount is too little. I feel like I got ripped off. Grrrrrrr !  I am looking into drinking raw milk now and taking probiotics instead, Google that if you have asthma and/or eczema, the research and case studies are interesting. Good luck!</li>
    <li> product is marginally effective  but has a long way to go to match the results of exzerderm, which is no longer available ??????? plus its cost is  at leas  twice that of exzerderm by volume</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My son had eczema on his feet and he was suffering with this. After using this product for 5 days, it disappeared. I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This product worked amazingly well.  While it did not make my eczema on my arms and elbows disappear completely, it worked better than any other product I have used to date.</li>
    <li> My baby is 5 months old and has eczema on her face. After using this product, eczema is gone within one week!!</li>
    <li> I got this creme for my husband to try in place of the drug-filled cream he had been using. This cream is quite effective for his dry skin spots. It rubs into the skin well, without staying on top of the skin. It also stays on the spots where he wants it, and is starting to heal those spots. The shipping was good, and the product arrived at our house in a timely manner. We are happy with everything to do with this product and the store that sells it.</li>
    <li> Great product for my sensitive skin. I break out every summer and this creme works amazing and I apply it daily to prevent the outbreaks I love it!</li>
    <li> My son has had eczema on his face for as long as I can remember. I had a friend suggest Eczemaderm and it&#x27;s amazing. Lightning fast shipment.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0043QK9Z8 Eczemaderm - Naturally Medicated Treatment Cream for Eczema]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first buy of this product. I have tried using for 2 days and my eczema seems improvement. I will keep using and considering to buy more soon.</li>
    <li> it peeled and irrittated my skin i wish i could get my money back. the cream way too oily if it was water based perhaps it would have helped too thick and heavy</li>
    <li> I bought directly from their website. eczemaderm.com. They charged me double what I originally ordered, and never sent the product. They have no working phone number to contact (no customer service), and they do NOT respond to emails, so you have no product but they have your payment info and charge you! They have an F rating on the BBB. Buyer beware. I alerted Amazon. I figured since they were a selling company on amazon they were legit. If you look them up, there are many other people that have had the same thing happen.    here is the information about their company on the Better Business Buereau.  [...]Laboratories-in-Temecula-CA-100101949    DO NOT PURCHASE!!!</li>
    <li> It cleared up my babys skin and stopped him from itching after only a few days. I even purchased it a second time. I like to apply it with the Neosporin lotion for eczema.</li>
    <li> When no other cream helped with my eczema, this cream made all the difference the world. It calmed my irritated skin, help keep it moisturized and allowed it to heal. Total lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I was taking the natural approach, and changed all my soaps and detergents, but I still had eczema all over my body. I tried this and the spots noticeably began to fade, they are almost gone so I need one more bottle. It is small, but worth it for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 6 month old son who has suffered from eczema since he was 2 months old and nothing has worked including this cream. Better say the amount is so small that it was gone in less than a day. Maybe if my son only had the problem in certain parts of his body but for a child that has it on his entire body this was not worth buying because you would never know if it works plus the pricing is way to high.</li>
    <li> It did not prove to be a cream for eczema; I regret putting my money behind it. Sorry, but it&#x27;s the truth</li>
    <li> Instead of alleviating the irritation and pain this item augmented and spread the inflammation. My wife who was the user stopped using eczemaderm. and requested her  physician to prescribe a different ointment. Too soon to tell how ii is working. But Eczemadern is definitely OUT.....</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for little less then a week and the results are noticeable already! It is not a thick oily cream, instead it goes on smoothly (which is a benefit when putting on eyelids!) It moisturizes lightly leaving skin soft and smooth and fragrance free. There has been a dramatic lessening of redness and itchiness on my daughters arm and eyelids.  As noted by other reviewers, the jar is small  but a little seems to go a long way.  I have been applying it on my daughter both morning and night and will cotinue to use this.  What a relief not to use steroids!</li>
    <li> This product seem to work well for my dry, itchy skin but the tub is very small and only lasted me about 3 days.</li>
    <li> We have got the exact product we ordered on a timely manner but the actual product seems to be smaller than the image we saw online before buying it.</li>
    <li> this product was on of the best non-perscription creams we have found.  we found it to be better than many of the percription high dollar creams</li>
    <li> eczema cream did not work, visit dermatologist and get a real prescription, went away in two weeks.</li>
    <li> We purchased this product for our infant&#x27;s eczema.  If used regularly, it will certainly replace the skin&#x27;s moisture barrier.  We used it on the more severe areas in place of hydrocortisone cream.</li>
    <li> I always bothered with itchiness for months now in both legs but when i started using eczemaderm at least now it started to lessen and almost gone the marks.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because my daughter developed eczema.  It worked great to control her outbreak.  Now she uses the cream preventatively.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried this on a bumpy skin rash my 6 year old had on her arm and this works better than over the counter cortisone, also, I have a dry eczema spot on my nose and this works well for that too. So, I like it, and will keep using it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works. I&#x27;ve had finger tip exzema for about a year and this is the first item that has helped the problem.</li>
