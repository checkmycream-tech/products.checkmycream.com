<li> I do think that they could be a little smaller cubed, because they would melt a little quicker, but other than that I think this really works wonders makes your face really soft &amp; polished.</li>
<li> The Lemon and sugar slough away my dead skin leaving my skin brighter and soft.</li>
<li> If you look under a microscope at many of the less expensive abrasives that are put into face scrubs, such as sugar, apricot pit, and walnut hull, it will look like a bunch of sharp rocks.</li>
<li> Ppl have to know that it can dry up.</li>
<li> It sucks the dirt out of my pores like a vacuum and makes my skin so soft.</li>
<li> you can actually break them in half and use.</li>
<li> I have purchased this product twice now and little bummed out, the ingredients the second time around had changed</li>
<li> I use one of these cubes every other day to firm, brighten &amp; exfoliate my face.  </li>
<li> I bought this product as well as few other diva stuff products.</li>
<li> You just a little piece to exfoliate your face.</li>
<li> Worst purchase ever, all of it went to trash bin.</li>

    <li> LOVE this face scrub I do think that they could be a little smaller cubed, because they would melt a little quicker, but other than that I think this really works wonders makes your face really soft &amp; polished.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, my skin was glowing. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice now and little bummed out, the ingredients the second time around had changed and it just doesn&#x27;t work or smell the same. Love diva stuff products but boo to ingredient changes.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and love how it exfoliates my skin!</li>
    <li> Ok. But you need to use patience using this as its  a different kind of product. Ppl have to know that it can dry up. They refunded me for this as It was not my preference to use this item. Customer service was really awesome!!</li>
    <li> Amazing this was first sent as a sample with another purchase and I bought it ASAP this product left my face feeling amazing !</li>
    <li> First of all, what an ingenious idea to market a product that is divided up into single use servings!  The lemonade scent is AMAZING &amp; should some suds slip into your mouth, it tastes like sugar.  As we all know, sugar scrubs are very healthy for your face.  I use one of these cubes every other day to firm, brighten &amp; exfoliate my face.  My face always feels smooth &amp; my skin looks bright &amp; healthy after each use!  Don&#x27;t cheat yourself, TREAT yourself &amp; order this product!  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This scrub/cleanser rocks! It sucks the dirt out of my pores like a vacuum and makes my skin so soft. It also smells like a fresh glass of lemonade. Best scrub I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> These little cubes are awesome and perfectly portioned so you end up using the perfect amount. They smell amazing and leave my face SO soft! I look forward to my shower each morning just so I can use this scrub, I love it!</li>
    <li> I have very acne prone, oily skin. This scrub has done wonders for my skin in my problem areas. It also smells SO GOOD.</li>
    <li> I just received this product yesterday and let me say it leaves my face feeling so clean! It has a pleasant lemony scent but not to strong and very easy to use. Product arrived sooner then expected and even Included a free mini bar of Diva Stuff Vanilla Latte anti cellulite soap.</li>
    <li> I really liked the lemony smell. That was nice. I did not like the glycerin soap in it. It left an oily residue on my skin and I had to actually wash my face after I used this scrub to get the oil off. Another thing that I did not  like was how extremely coarse it is. If you look under a microscope at many of the less expensive abrasives that are put into face scrubs, such as sugar, apricot pit, and walnut hull, it will look like a bunch of sharp rocks. That is what this scrub felt like on my skin. When someone uses inexpensive abrasives they are actually putting microscopic tears in their skin and causing damage and inflammation. If you do that for years  the damage will accumulate and age your skin and cause permanent scar tissue. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as well as few other diva stuff products. Worst purchase ever, all of it went to trash bin. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wow this re energizes me super fast ,This scrub is the best i ever used makes me feel invigorated by improving the Blood Flow through my face and the Lemon scent improves  and stimulates my alertness.The Lemon and sugar slough away my dead skin leaving my skin brighter and soft. An added plus my Hand feel softer too.</li>
    <li> Diva stuff has become my facial go to! I simply love this line.  This sugar derm has an amazing scent to it.  It wakes me right up!  My face feels so clean and soft after using this.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> CULT PRODUCT STATUS!&lt;br /&gt;The perfect face wash, exfoliator, pore purging, acne fighting/preventing product.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product RELIGIOUSLY and it keeps my face hydrated,  smooth, soft, clean and acne free.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> you can actually break them in half and use. feels nice, w nice clean smell</li>
    <li> Loved it it leaves my face very soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and it really cleanses your skin. Try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> Love the lemon scent. You just a little piece to exfoliate your face. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! My skin always looks better when I use it. And if I accidentally get it in my mouth while washing my face , it is also DELICIOUS.</li>
