      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good razor at an affordable price, this is the one to get.  </li>
      <li>The (hopefully) good news is the owner&#x27;s manual states the \\&quot;foil\\&quot; cover for the blades is good for a year, &amp; the blades themselves are good for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s exceptionally sturdy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Great design, OK shave, crappy trimmer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair, this is a nice device.  </li>
      <li>wait, there&#x27;s more!  </li>
      <li>very easy, very safe.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my armpits though, which have the stiffer hair this thing is primarily designed for (beards...</li>
      <li>/&gt;In terms of this being a quality electric razor with a number of nice features, it is.  </li>
      <li>Nice feel in the hands.</li>
      <li>In fact, this shaver is quite nice because of its&lt;br /&gt;simplicity.</li>
      <li>To end the comparison, I actually own a top-of-the-line Braun.</li>
      <li>Both are equally effective, but I prefer the Philips&#x27;s implementation since there is no worry of knocking off the cover in the case of the Panasonic.</li>
      <li>Nice and compact for travel or for use in the shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d expect a much better battery for a good, rechargeable razor.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I liked:</li>
      <li>It looks good, and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cleaning - also very easy.  </li>
      <li>so no mustache, thank god) and it gets that very easily also which is cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so no mustache, thank god) and it gets that very easily also which is cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It managed to give a good shave, but not a thorough clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Another great feature is that it is rechargeable so it can be charged and ready to go on the road with you if you&#x27;re in a hurry and must run out the door.</li>
      <li>love it take with me on the road  </li>
      <li>I wear a shirt and tie most days and any stubble is a problem as it catches on your shirt.</li>
      <li>If you want to spend more, get those.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been solely on blades for that time, but decided to take a chance on this Wet-Dry razor, and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>All I can say is it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>For the money, I think a 5 star rating is more than fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, if you expect to be able to replace a razor with this and still get that \\&quot;baby smooth\\&quot; shave you can forget about it.</li>
      <li>This model has a recharging stand which makes it more bulky to pack when traveling.</li>
      <li>meaning I should be able to rub my hands across my face and not feel any stubble.</li>
      <li>This came just as my husband experienced a problem with his old shaver, so it came in handy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;What could be better.</li>
      <li>The latest shaver I will be reviewing is Panasonic&#x27;s ES-SL41-W Arc 3 Wet/Dry</li>
      <li>I like this better than my boyfriend&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many electric razors that I&#x27;m beginning to feel like Charlie Brown, fooled once again by Lucy pulling the football.</li>
      <li>If you want to spend more, get those.  </li>
      <li>Evaluating this new product on its own, I feel it does a good job of shaving.</li>
      <li>not saying this shaver is an exact replica of Braun, but it is good</li>
      <li>And whatever the model, I am still a strong advocate for Panasonic shavers; I really love them.</li>
      <li>The charger is a nice docking station, and charges quickly.  </li>
      <li>Not the best charger for travel though and the red charging light does not change color when the razor is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It may work better for those with light beards but my heavier beard won out most days.</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for a solid electric razor at a very fair price, I would recommend the Panasonic ES-Sl41.</li>
      <li>But if you just want to get this chore over with as quickly as possible, comfortably, and still get a very good shave then this is a better choice.  </li>
      <li>I must admit I thought this was a bargain at $50 based on the reviews (mostly from vine reviewers who got their stuff for free).</li>
      <li>The most important feature is the shaving ability, and</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, I like the ES-S141-W, and I consider it a good medium-range Panasonic model, but given my usage, it doesn&#x27;t give much over the least-expensive model.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rechargeable, super easy to clean, able to be used in the water and has a built-in trim function (a nice touch).</li>
      <li>Reasonably effective - often takes a fair number of passes though to get everything, particularly hairs that are finer or don&#x27;t stand right up.  </li>
      <li>This is a great feature, since it is not necessary to bring along the charger on most of my trips.</li>
      <li>Cleans easily with easy removal and replacement of the razor assembly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to re-charge.</li>
      <li>The charger is a bit clunky, but is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rinsing the arc foils after a shave is easy.  </li>
      <li>Cannot figure out how you could easily cut yourself with this.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and not over complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t know of many electrical razors that don&#x27;t have that issue with a full beard according to my husband.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom Line: If you&#x27;re shopping for a quality electric shaver for someone who has rarely or never used one, then this is your best choice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through probably 10 of them at this point, and I can say that this one is hands down, the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable and easy to access for all functions.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Comfort - easy to hold, vibration not annoying.  </li>
      <li>Head size is huge.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like that the charging stand is huge</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s extremely light.</li>
      <li>ARC 3 gave a really smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>My dream is to find an electric razor that would give a smooth shave without the drawback of blades.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To begin, the shaver feels balanced and comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>Work great, but I don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
      <li>it gives a smooth shaving experience in that sense.  </li>
      <li>shaver has water shutters that allows water to flow freely through the head.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to clean .&lt;br</li>
      <li>ES-LT41-K, which is a much better, more fully featured shaver capable of literally baby smooth results.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I hated shaving in the morning with my Remington. I&#x27;d look closely after shaving to find stubble left behind. I got pissed and bought this Panasonic. It just outperforms it, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely light. I shave twice as fast. The shave is closer. I use water as a lubricant and that really helps a lot. Clean up is so efficient... it cleans itself! I&#x27;ve used Norelco Triple-headers and Remington dual foil shavers. This makes them look silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I know. Everything (almost) that I review gets 5-stars. I suppose I&#x27;m lucky or spend too long looking at various brands when buying.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It takes forever to end up with terrible shave. The head is so small it takes way to long. Does not get all the hair. It&#x27;s worthless. I used it for a few months until I used a 3 head Remington. Head size is huge. Great shave in seconds. Threw the Panasonic in the trash.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my boyfriend has a Panasonic ES8423 [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Blue]] (which does cost about 2x what this one does) that I borrow from time to time for the purpose of shaving my legs or pits when I have an emergency need to do so and don&#x27;t want to shower.  He doesn&#x27;t appreciate that though!  (We both clean it after use, so it&#x27;s not as gross as it sounds...)  So when I saw the option to get this product to try I lept on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been shaving exclusively with it for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole I very much like it...though I have to admit, the other gives a closer shave (which is why I only gave 4 stars).  However, for the price savings, this one might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving - very easy, very safe.  Cannot figure out how you could easily cut yourself with this.  Goes anyway.  Dry shaves with very little irritation.  Shaves wet with soap without getting too much residue/grossness.  Not as fast (or as close) as the Mach 3 stick razor in the shower, so except when I need to shave dry, the Mach 3 will continue to by my implement of choice.  Reasonably effective - often takes a fair number of passes though to get everything, particularly hairs that are finer or don&#x27;t stand right up.  Works great on my armpits though, which have the stiffer hair this thing is primarily designed for (beards...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort - easy to hold, vibration not annoying.  Easy to maneuver and head is a reasonable size for doing what it needs to do.  As I said, almost no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - also very easy.  Open the little tabs below the head, turn it on and run water over it.  Cleans right up (not that I find it gets too scummy anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging - very fast.  I like this better than my boyfriend&#x27;s.  This has an inductive charger so it has a base rather than plugging in directly.  To me this seems safer for something kept in a bathroom.  Red indicator light tells you you&#x27;ve got it connected.  His shaver tells you what percentage charge you&#x27;re at (but also makes a high pitched whining noise when charging)...this one doesn&#x27;t tell you a think (and also makes no noise...yay!), but I figure as long as it&#x27;s working when I pick it up, I don&#x27;t really care.  Charges in 15 minutes according to the box...seems about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the white though because it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what color the shaver is, the base is black.  A black base with red lighting and a white shaver with blue features is kind of tacky and unattractive looking...I would go for the black one.  (White will show dirt and stains worse, but will not show soap scum as bad though, for what it&#x27;s worth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer works great! Love the little pop up trimmer...have to be careful as the head blocks visibility in the mirror, but I&#x27;ve been using this for eyebrow shaping...much faster than plucking and it seems to work just great...a little surprised it works as well as it does frankly.  Trimmer works great on much finer hair also - I have a light dusting of hair above my lip (I&#x27;m female so no mustache, thank god) and it gets that very easily also which is cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, it seems like a good shaver.  Other than the closeness it compares very well to the more expensive Panasonic, so this seems like a good more affordable option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update the review if I come across anything else.mething kept in a bathroom.

    <li> I&#x27;ve only used electric shavers for brief periods of time.  After all, blades shave closer, offer a faster shave and are generally a lot more convenient.  I hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver since my old Norelco rotary way back when, so I was looking forward to checking out the Panasonic Milano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin, the shaver feels balanced and comfortable to hold.  Construction quality seems excellent.  The charger is a bit clunky, but is easy to use.  Not the best charger for travel though and the red charging light does not change color when the razor is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this electric razor wet and I&#x27;ve used it dry and it definitely shaves closer when wet.  Giving myself a good shave takes me about 10 minutes to get it to the point where it&#x27;s almost as close as a blade.  If you were in a hurry, you could shave in a couple of minutes, but I&#x27;m looking for a pretty close shave, so I go over my beard quite a few times with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the short of it is that this is a very good razor at an extremely competitive price.  For the money, I think a 5 star rating is more than fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks or so, but I do suspect I&#x27;ll ultimately return to blades, because as mentioned, they&#x27;re faster and offer a closer shave.  But if you are looking for a solid electric razor at a very fair price, I would recommend the Panasonic ES-Sl41.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my kid and it works well it is worth the money. I would buy another one if needed.</li>
    <li> I tried this unit for a few months but was not satisfied with its performance. You really have to work at it to remove the stubble. All I can say is it&#x27;s okay but my old cheap Remington rotary worked better than this thing.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic wet-dry shavers exclusively for the past, um, 25, 30 years? So long that I can&#x27;t remember. I&#x27;ve used the least-expensive models and some pretty pricey ones, and on my light beard, I usually prefer the cheap ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic model I had before this one, the ES4026NC, cost about $30, and it has lasted nearly four years (and still works). It&#x27;s a little buzzy, and pretty plasticky, but that&#x27;s fine for the price and the longevity. It has only two blades, which makes the angle of attack sharper, so while it may not cover as much skin surface at one time, I think it gets closer to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-S141-W, on the other hand, is smoother and quieter. It has three blades, and a wider, flatter surface with which to press against your skin. I feel like I have to press harder to get as close. It&#x27;s still pretty comfortable with water and foam, though; It&#x27;s not objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must confess that I have always used Panasonic shavers to do a first run on my face, and then I follow up with a blade. With the shaver alone, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m quite presentable. So, I quickly shave in the shower with water and foam, then do the detail work with the blade. I do not spend a lot of time with the shaver. So why even use the shaver? The first pass removes enough beard that using the blade doesn&#x27;t hurt at all--and I suggest that it makes the blade last longer. I know; it&#x27;s quirky, but it works for me. However, it also means that it doesn&#x27;t matter too much which Panasonic shaver I choose (another reason to stick with the cheap ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had ES-S141-W for nearly two weeks, and it&#x27;s still running on the initial (lengthy, overnight) charge. I use it for maybe a minute every morning. I don&#x27;t like that the charging stand is huge--it&#x27;s bigger than the razor itself. That would be a benefit if you were going to use it at the sink instead of the shower, because it would provide a sturdier platform, but the ES4026NC came with tiny charger that takes up about the same amount of space as a C cell battery; it&#x27;s much easier to travel with, though because either shaver will last at least two weeks on a charge (given my usage), that&#x27;s not a huge deal. However, one big bonus with the newer shaver&#x27;s charger: The shaver itself is sealed, so you can plop it on the charger without worrying about it being wet. With the older charger, I had to attempt to dry it out by blowing in it and sticking Q-Tips in there before I stuck it on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the plastic piece used to protect the shaver&#x27;s screens while traveling; my older shaver&#x27;s plastic piece was tiny, but this one is is huge, with spikey extensions. Not a major irritation, but still puzzling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other issue related to cost: A replacement set of blades/foil is around $28 for this shaver. That&#x27;s not bad (to me), but with the really inexpensive Panasonic shavers, like the current ES-RW30-S, that&#x27;s not much less than the price of a new razor. Sometimes I choose a new razor instead, especially given the way I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I like the ES-S141-W, and I consider it a good medium-range Panasonic model, but given my usage, it doesn&#x27;t give much over the least-expensive model. However, the addition of the third blade might make it more effective for someone with a heavier beard and/or someone who doesn&#x27;t want to follow it with a blade. And whatever the model, I am still a strong advocate for Panasonic shavers; I really love them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now. It&#x27;s OK, but not a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s light, easy to use, and idiot proof. I just picked it up and used it.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used wet or dry. Helps a bit to use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t tug or pull the hair, and has a fine enough mesh screen to prevent my face from getting nicked.&lt;br /&gt;- Cheaper than disposable razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The charge doesn&#x27;t last at all. I travel for work, and by the end of the week, it&#x27;s dead. I&#x27;d expect a much better battery for a good, rechargeable razor.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t really cut very well for those of us with thicker, fuller beards. I have to press really, really hard on my face, and even then, most of the hairs are too thick to be picked up and cut. It&#x27;s OK for maintenance when I just feel lazy, but doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s fine for touch ups, or if you have a very slight beard that needs little attention. For us daily razor users, it&#x27;s not a suitable replacement. You&#x27;ll still need to break out the Mach 3 or Mach 10 or whatever and get to work.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a five star is because if you are starting with a &#x27;full beard&#x27;, you will have to trim it down first or you may have problems with pulling, etc. However, I don&#x27;t know of many electrical razors that don&#x27;t have that issue with a full beard according to my husband. He loves the fact you don&#x27;t have to remove this wet/dry shaver to clean. Just let the water run through the foil. It also has a great pop up trimmer for sideburns and mustache. The ultra thin vibrating foil won&#x27;t pull on the facial hairs (unless your beard is really long) and gives a close shave. Another great feature is that it is rechargeable so it can be charged and ready to go on the road with you if you&#x27;re in a hurry and must run out the door.</li>
    <li> My husband has recently started getting a straight razor shave from the barber weekly, but he needs touch ups in between.  This product has been doing the trick perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most wet/dry electric razors, the wet provides a much closer shave than the dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery takes a while to charge, but once it does, it lasts for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and not over complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the other reviewer who said it looks like a storm trooper :P</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun&#x27;s series 5 for over a year, and I am a happy&lt;br /&gt;camper. Comparing this one with Braun&#x27;s might not be fair, but at least I&lt;br /&gt;get some idea where this shaver stands. The overall build quality is&lt;br /&gt;somewhat cheap because of the white plastic body, but the feel from the grip&lt;br /&gt;is not bad at all. Because the grip is slimmer than Braun&#x27;s, I can hold it&lt;br /&gt;easily and comfortably. Also, I believe this product is a lower end model in&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s line and lacks extra features, such as a display panel and self&lt;br /&gt;cleaning. However, those are minor features, and these features are not&lt;br /&gt;always necessary. In fact, this shaver is quite nice because of its&lt;br /&gt;simplicity. The most important feature is the shaving ability, and I can&lt;br /&gt;tell this is close to my one-year old [Braun] shaver. Obviously, this one&lt;br /&gt;has lower rpm and there&#x27;s no true pulsonic thing going on, but it serves its&lt;br /&gt;purpose very well. Maybe it&#x27;s time for me to replace my Braun&#x27;s blade, but&lt;br /&gt;this shaver does very nice job on my not-too-hairy face (when it is wet or&lt;br /&gt;dry). I don&#x27;t know how often I need to replace the blade, but maintenance&lt;br /&gt;and cleaning seem simple, so I am not too concerned. Charging this shaver&lt;br /&gt;took longer than my Braun&#x27;s shaver, but I only shave once a day so it wasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;a big problem.&lt;br /&gt; Overall, this is a decent electric wet/dry shaver considering the&lt;br /&gt;price. As a person who likes to give comparisons on brands, I want to&lt;br /&gt;emphasize that I compared this shaver to Braun because I know there are&lt;br /&gt;others out there who prefer a affordable version of a very good shaver;&lt;br /&gt;therefore, please take this into consideration when reading this review. I&lt;br /&gt;am not saying this shaver is an exact replica of Braun, but it is good&lt;br /&gt;enough!</li>
    <li> This is a decent shaver that actually provides a lot for the price. If given the choice between this shaver or purchasing waaaaaay over priced blades for those disposable type razors in the store...this would win hands down. If trying to decide between this or \\&quot;safety razors\\&quot;, the safety razors would win hands down due to both price and closeness of shave. If selecting between this and other more expensive electric shavers, it would be a tough choice. Here is why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Price. This packs a lot of amenities into a small price. It&#x27;s rechargeable, super easy to clean, able to be used in the water and has a built-in trim function (a nice touch). Given the price point, this will get the job done while not breaking the bank or having the consumer repurchase expensive blades every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Convenient. The ability to recharge, bring along while traveling, access a little built-in trimmer and clean quickly makes this an ultra convenient shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Ergonomic. Nice feel in the hands. Comfortable and easy to access for all functions. Each to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Sufficiently Fast Charge &amp; Holds Charge Well. This is a sufficiently fast charge and it holds the charge quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limitations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why not a 5 star review? Plain and simple, the shave isn&#x27;t that close. It always seems to leave a tiny bit of stubble which is just the nature of the device itself. If you are searching for that ultra smooth shave, this will NOT get you there. On the other hand, if you simply need a quick touch up, on the go shaver that is convenient and cost effective...OR if you have a very soft beard then perhaps this is the right item for you. Those with a bit more thick or abrasive beard will likely encounter that last bit of stubble on a constant basis. Those that use a safety razor for a good old fashioned shave will be left lacking...it in now way compares to the close shave derived from old fashioned instruments.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really compare this to other shavers because the one that this replaced, also a Panasonic, was pretty old. Evaluating this new product on its own, I feel it does a good job of shaving. I don&#x27;t grow hair that fast but it is coarse, and this shaver gives me a pretty smooth shave. It is lightweight, easy to hold, and overall easy to use. It is also a lot quieter than my old shaver. I don&#x27;t know if shavers are just overall quieter these days but I do notice that this one is pretty quiet. I use it dry - no water, no cream or gel. I get no irritation from shaving that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the white version of this shaver and every time I look at it, it reminds me of the stormtroopers/clones from Star Wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, overall I like this shaver because it is comfortable, the shape facilitates a good grip, it is lightweight, quiet and gives me a close, smooth shave. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I got this about a month ago and wanted to put it through the paces in order to give the product a complete review. For starters, I don the beard. I have for about ten years and will continue to do so until I am dead in the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am always on the look out for anything that will clean up my cheeks or neckline and clean it up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience: it&#x27;s an electric and wet/dry, so it is mad convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean: Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of shaving. Again, I am trying to clean up my cheeks and neckline. It leaves a lot on the skin and I have to go back over with a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am well aware that I might be using this product incorrectly but for me and my needs, it does not work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of shaving... I have a short beard, and I trim around it every couple of days to minimize razor burn and irritation.  My dream is to find an electric razor that would give a smooth shave without the drawback of blades.  I decided to give the Panasonic ES-SL41-W \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; Men&#x27;s 3-Blade Wet-Dry Shaver a try via the Amazon Vine program.  After giving it a fair shot at my face, I&#x27;m still looking for my perfect electric razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, this is a nice device.  The ability to use it as either a wet or dry razor is a plus, and the built-in pop-up trimmer is nice to get up close to the edges of my beard and mustache. When I&#x27;m using it to shave under my chin and neck, there&#x27;s no pulling... it gives a smooth shaving experience in that sense.  It feels solid and comfortable in my hand, much more comfortable than many other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, I couldn&#x27;t get a result that didn&#x27;t leave a raspy stubble behind (and I don&#x27;t think my beard is particularly thick).  I tried going with the grain, against the grain, across the grain... and it still felt a bit like sandpaper afterwards.  It may be that my face and beard just isn&#x27;t one that will ever respond well to an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of this being a quality electric razor with a number of nice features, it is.  Personally, it&#x27;s not one that I&#x27;ll continue to use, but I think people who use electric razors on a regular basis will like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review Program&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used electric razors in the past decade, because I just couldn&#x27;t get one that felt like it really did a clean job.  I&#x27;ve been solely on blades for that time, but decided to take a chance on this Wet-Dry razor, and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two cutting surfaces on this model, a set of foil-coated blades on the top, and a sideburn/ neck trimmer on the back.  Both work very well, with the foil-coated blades providing the smooth shave results I was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried both dry shaving and in the shower, and I must say, I liked the results better dry shaving.  Somehow, the wet shave didn&#x27;t seem to cut as smoothly.  Both shaved off the visible hair, but the wet shave felt stubbly, whereas the dry shave felt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I am really glad I gave this a shot, particularly for days when I&#x27;m not feeling like I have the time or want to spend the effort on a full blade shave.</li>
    <li> This is a comparative review of the [[ASIN:B007VB50JW Philips Norelco QS6160/50 StyleRazor Pro]] vs. [[ASIN:B008KEJ1US Panasonic ES-Sl41-W Shaver]]. I received both through the Amazon Vine program and have used the former for over two months and the latter for the last two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know they are not at the same price point, with the former being almost double the price. So the question is: is the Philips really better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give you the punchline first: yes, the Philips does give me a closer shave. This is done by a simple test: shave with one first, and listen carefully while shaving with the other. If you ask me, this alone settles the discussion since the Philips also does the grooming better and can thus justify the extra cost. However, I think it is still worth comparing them so that you know the tradeoffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of shaving, the Philips foil is noticeably thinner. This is why it gives a closer shave, but the foil is also more fragile (so don&#x27;t drop it). The Panasonic boosts wet/dry shaving capability. What that means is that it has a switch/door that allows water to come out and carry the debris away from the bottom of the chamber through the door when you rinse it. If you do this with the Philips, the water will just fill up the chamber. Whether wet shaving is important to you is quite personal. For the record I did try shaving wet a few times with the Panasonic, but the Philips always pick up some afterwards. To end the comparison, I actually own a top-of-the-line Braun. I can tell you that you really need to press very hard on the Braun to pick up anything after the Philips. Kudos to Philips for matching Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of grooming, the Panasonic is pretty basic. There is just a trimmer that you pop up. In comparison, the Philips have two attachments with 10 height settings. The trimmer also has a small size that can be used alone, giving you a lot of control on where to trim. I use it on the sideburn all thetime. It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of battery, both are excellent off the box. In fact, I was able to get over ten shaves with each. Bear in mind that these are new shavers and so the battery life should be pretty good. I will come back and revise if they fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of charging, both comes with a charging station that are fairly big. The Philips seems pretty fragile and I am afraid of breaking it when I use it. But it folds and so it is acceptable. The Panasonic is rock solid and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of traveling, the Philips comes with a snap-on foil cover and has a lock mode (hold the power button for a few seconds), whereas the Panasonic has a snap-on foil cover that extends to cover the power button. Both are equally effective, but I prefer the Philips&#x27;s implementation since there is no worry of knocking off the cover in the case of the Panasonic. The Philips is a lot heavier than the Panasonic one though. At least 1.5 times heavier, if not twice. (But once you factor in the weight of the charging station, the two are quite equal.) The Philips does come with its travel pouch and a small cleaning brush, so I guess they assume you will travel with it. The Panasonic does not come with any accessory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottomline is: unless wet shaving is important to you, I think you should shell out for the Philips. The Panasonic is a decent shaver, but frankly, it does not seem wise to spend half of what you can use towards a shaver that gets you a closer shave, is it?</li>
    <li> This came just as my husband experienced a problem with his old shaver, so it came in handy.  It doesn&#x27;t provide the same close shave as his Remmington rotating head shaver.  Also, if the shaver runs out of power, there is no way to use it while it is charging.  This is definitely an issue if the battery dies out in the middle of a shave.  He does like the trimmer, but will most likely replace his Remmington with something similar and use this as a backup.</li>
    <li> Product works well as a dry or wet razor; however takes about twice as long to shave compared to a rotary head razor. Nice and compact for travel or for use in the shower. Was not happy with the final shave though.</li>
    <li> I did not like this razor! Would barely trim my hairs, would gap up and pull on them to the point they would hurt which an electric razor should never do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Holds a Charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Performance&lt;br /&gt;Noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not suggest buying these, Even if you found them on sale for $2!</li>
    <li> Great shaver it is a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;The battery has a long run time. It is easy to clean .&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is my wife keeps steeling it.</li>
    <li> I must admit I thought this was a bargain at $50 based on the reviews (mostly from vine reviewers who got their stuff for free). I used the trimmer as well as another trimmer to make my hair as short as possible and the shaver just won&#x27;t work. You are supposed to go with the flow of hair, but that does not work. I can do it against, that slightly works but it causes in grown hairs. It does my cheeks and sideburns slightly but it doesn&#x27;t work at all on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it requires a 15 hour charge just for 20 minutes? That&#x27;s is not a lot considering I have to use this thing for 15 minutes to get a basic shave, and that&#x27;s wet or dry.</li>
    <li> This shaves well in dry shave, but creates a lot of noise and vibration, which makes it uncomfortable to shave and creates a feeling like you&#x27;re in the dentist&#x27;s chair. During and after shaving, small hairs fall out of the shaver and onto your body, which was kind off gross. On the plus side, it&#x27;s light, small, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. It&#x27;s also easy to re-charge. Overall though, I prefer sticking to the Phillips Norelco three blade rotary shavers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a dozen razors, all top of the line and this Panasonic eats um alive. Close shave and wet and dry shave, can&#x27;t ask for any more. Service was excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used electric razors.  I&#x27;ve gone through probably 10 of them at this point, and I can say that this one is hands down, the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  It cuts close, is easy to clean, and extremely sturdy.  I dropped it off the counter the other day, and had no problems at all.  The charger is a nice docking station, and charges quickly.  The fact that I can use this either wet or dry is a nice feature.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good razor at an affordable price, this is the one to get.  I love it.</li>
    <li> love it take with me on the road  does the job</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 5 year old Panasonic that needs recharging more often than it should. This is the 3rd Panasonic I have bought in 15 years so they do last. This has a much smaller grip than my older razor. This model does not have a low charge indicator. My older Panasonic has a simple plug-in for recharging. This model has a recharging stand which makes it more bulky to pack when traveling. I plan to keep my older razor for this purpose. Looking back I wish I had spent a bit more and got the ES-RF31-S instead. However, I do not know if the charger is a stand or a plug-in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now a true believer in the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave (using shaving cream with an electric razor instead of shaving \\&quot;dry\\&quot;).  The result is impressive.  I can actually get a closer shave with this than shaving manually with a razor blade.  I suppose it&#x27;s similar to using an electric toothbrush compared to brushing manually - there&#x27;s no comparison.  My girlfriend actually said my skin felt smoother than hers!  The dry shave is decent, too, but use the shaving cream if you have the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery/charge life is excellent, too.  One full charge gives you enough capacity for over 20 \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaves (which consume more energy than dry shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives on this shaver is it takes fifteen hours to fully charge it and it doesn&#x27;t have a low charge indicator to let you know you&#x27;re about to run out of power.</li>
    <li> Summary: This is a pretty basic wet-dry razor, but IMHO a good deal at this price point.  Its battery life and display features won&#x27;t blow you away, but it works well, either dry or with shaving cream, and in the shower or out of it.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked: I like this razor quite a bit.  The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, of course, but it&#x27;s close to that, and at least as close as my rotary razor, and I like being able to use shaving cream and shave in the shower.  It&#x27;s water tight, so I can leave it in the shower until it&#x27;s time to charge, then drop it into its charger for a day or so.  It looks good, and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could be better. It&#x27;s a no-frills model, so the battery is only rated for 21 minutes, and there aren&#x27;t any displays showing when you are fully charged or how much charge you have left.  (We&#x27;ll see if I can consistently get a week of shaves over time.  If so, then I could just charge it every Sunday night.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance: Basically, you clean this thing by running water into it while a \\&quot;cleaning shutter is closed,\\&quot; plus an occasional drop or two of hand soap.  Panasonic recommends replacing the outer foil once a year, and the blades every two years, but my guess is that by the end of two years, most people will probably be ready to upgrade to a model with more features, so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatives:  For a bit less money, you can get a two blade model, or for varying amounts of more money, you can get more blades, longer lasting batteries, or better displays.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to do the comparison, but I recommend poking around in the reviews for similar products before you make up your mind.  Still, I like this model a lot, and recommend it to people looking for a basic wet-dry shaver.</li>
    <li> The latest shaver I will be reviewing is Panasonic&#x27;s ES-SL41-W Arc 3 Wet/Dry Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At under $60, let&#x27;s give this shaver a spin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I.  WHAT&#x27;S INSIDE THE BOX:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Panasonic Arc 3 Shaver&lt;br /&gt;- Recharging Unit&lt;br /&gt;- Carrying Holder for storage and travel use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PANASONIC ARC 3:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ARC 3 is pre-charged right out of the box.  But the shaver has a 15-hour full charge and lasts up to 21 minutes (approx. 1 week) of cordless shaving and is backed by a 2-year limited warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has water shutters that allows water to flow freely through the head.  The shaver itself uses a multi-fit arc foil for maximum comfort and also utilizes 30 degree Nanotech Blades for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no light indicator on shaver itself, nor a timer, so you will need to plug it in the unit if it dies out on you and you will see the shaver has a light to show if the shaver is fully recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;III.  USING THE ARC 3:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed quite a few foil-based shavers and while it is true that you get an amazing shave using the more expensive pulsonic foil-based shaver, I was curious to see how the Arc 3 would do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ARC 3 gave a really smooth shave.  But like other experiences with a foil-based shaver, there was always strands of hair may it be above the lip or under the chin that I had to use the pop-up trimmer and then use the ARC 3 and shave again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was the shave perfect?  It managed to give a good shave, but not a thorough clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WET:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I waited a few days and it was time to shave again, but this time trying a wet shave.  And I felt that I had much better with the wet shave than the dry. The Nanotech Blades seem to pick up the stubble much better when wet shaving, it seems.  And similar to the dry shave, skin was smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But testing both, I felt the wet shave worked much more better than the dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RINSING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing the arc foils after a shave is easy.  Rinse clean under running water and use the shutter to allow the water to run freely through the head.  Easy clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This is a non-pivoting head shaver.  Nor is there a timer.  If these are important for you, I recommend checking out the ES-LT41K.[[ASIN:B009W6TBAS Panasonic, Arc 3 Shaver 3Blade Nanotech (Catalog Category: Personal Care / Shavers &amp; Trimmers)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the better shave and are willing to pay the price...the Arc 5 is what you maybe interested in.  Granted, it&#x27;s much, much more expensive than an Arc 3. [[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Multi Flex Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUDGMENT CALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At under $60, the Panasonic ARC 3 Wet/Dry shaver worked good, was it perfect, not really, but that is how things have been when I have reviewed other non-pulsonic foil-based shavers.  But the Panasonic Arc 3 did do much better with a wet shave and this is probably what many people would be interested in this shaver is the ability to shave in the shower and use with foam/gel without worrying about the unit and its blades being corrupted.  The shaver cleans easily thanks to the shutters and for the most part, it&#x27;s a solid electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that the performance of this Arc 3 is as expected of a three-blade foil device.  Want a better shave, you have to spend more and whether it&#x27;s a pulsonic device or a 4-blade shaver, such as Panasonic&#x27;s Arc 4 or much more expensive Arc 5, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for budget conscious buyers, the Arc 3 works very good (not great but very good).  Yes, I wish it was more in the high $40 range than $50 range but the shaver works as intended.  Works better in wet than dry but it worked very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, with the clean smooth shave and a rechargeable shaver that is easy to clean, I definitely recommend this shaver for the budget conscious buyer who wants a brand-name brand that is known for its long lasting stainless steel blades!er that is easy to clean, I definitely recommend this shaver for the budget conscious buyer who wants a brand-name brand that is known for its long lasting stainless steel blades!</li>
    <li> Until I reviewed a [[ASIN:B004I8NO8K Remington SR9130TV]] for Vine last year I hadn&#x27;t used an electric in many years, because I have very heavy facial hair &amp; generally have not gotten a decent shave from an electric. I found the Remington to be an exception; I actually got a great shave from it, but the heads on that unit went totally dull twice at 3 months; so I pretty much gave up on using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings us to the Panasonic. It appears to be exactly the opposite. The (hopefully) good news is the owner&#x27;s manual states the \\&quot;foil\\&quot; cover for the blades is good for a year, &amp; the blades themselves are good for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one other positive is I really like the sideburn trimmer, it does a better job than the Remington did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news: With my thick beard, it&#x27;s incapable of giving me a close shave. To get a smooth shave, I have to follow a long shave with the Panasonic with a hand razor. For full disclosure I don&#x27;t use shaving cream; I do bathe immediately before shaving to soften my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner&#x27;s manual states that it takes time for one&#x27;s beard to get used to a new razor, so I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic for a week before writing this review, but it just hasn&#x27;t gotten any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit might be ok for someone with very fine facial hair or who likes stubble, but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t do the job for me. It&#x27;s also pretty pricey for the poor performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: The blades lasted more like 2 months then 2 years.</li>
    <li> Work great, but I don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many electric razors that I&#x27;m beginning to feel like Charlie Brown, fooled once again by Lucy pulling the football. I read the descriptions and think &#x27;this time it will be different&#x27; and it never is. This razor is ok, but not great. Which is to say that I found it to be better than most but still not good enough for my preferences. I wear a shirt and tie most days and any stubble is a problem as it catches on your shirt. So I like my shaves very close. This razor doesn&#x27;t get me there. Good enough for the weekends when things are more casual but not workdays. I know others prefer the dryshaving but I found the wetshave to get me a little closer. The problem is that if you&#x27;re shaving around a goatee or stache, wetshaving in the shower is not really an option (unless you want to walk around with half a beard). It may work better for those with light beards but my heavier beard won out most days. And don&#x27;t get me started on its efficacy on a two-day or three-day growth. Ouch. Give me a traditional blades any day.</li>
    <li> I also have the [[ASIN:B007T0N7H2 Arc 3 Shaver 3Blade Nanotech]], model no. ES-LT41-K, which is a much better, more fully featured shaver capable of literally baby smooth results.  While this shaver doesn&#x27;t have as many features and doesn&#x27;t shave quite as well, it&#x27;s a better shaver for a different type of person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to use a shaver absolutely every day and make a real art out of it, then the other shaver I mentioned is a better one for you; it simply does a better job.  But if you just want to get this chore over with as quickly as possible, comfortably, and still get a very good shave then this is a better choice.  This shaver is also just plain more comfortable to use, especially with your favorite shaving cream or soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pivot head, no data display, it just shaves.  And it&#x27;s exceptionally sturdy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the thing I love most about this shaver is what all the other shavers I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t have.  Typically, a pricey electric shaver comes with some kind of bag or case, and you don&#x27;t want to just stick it back in its case without letting it dry off first.  Personally, I find that annoying; it basically means I&#x27;m never going to put my shaver away.  But this shaver comes with a fully functional cover which you can put on immediately after use while still allowing the shaver to dry, and it can be mounted or simply act as a stand. I put that under the category, \\&quot;Why in the hell didn&#x27;t we think of this before?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, there&#x27;s more!  Unlike the other model I mentioned, the charger base on this one is also a stand.  So whether you want to have just the shaver out on the counter, or always have charger out, either way it&#x27;s not just laying loose on the counter and doesn&#x27;t need to be put away in one of those damn cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use your favorite shaving cream, submerge the shaver in water just like you would with a regular razor, no worries.  In fact, this shaver is so tough and capable of mowing down thick facial hair that it could really practically be used as a body shaver as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as dry shaves, I have no idea.  I would never use any shaver dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you&#x27;re shopping for a quality electric shaver for someone who has rarely or never used one, then this is your best choice.ial hair that it could really practically be used as a body shaver as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as dry shaves, I have no idea.

    <li> I think the key word here is VALUE. For under $60, this product delivers a reliably close shave that rivals shavers $15-$20 higher. In the time-honored tradition of the typical Amazon consumer appliance review, here are the (you guessed it) PROS and CONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS.&lt;br /&gt;1. Overall performance. A close shave achieved through three blades: 2 rounded, and one squared-off center blade.  Although the shaver head is stationary, the blades do move up and down (i.e., with pressure, they retract slightly into the razor) providing some conformity too facial contours. Despite the low RPMs (see below), the three heads and perhaps the vaunted 30 degree angle work well.&lt;br /&gt;2. Hand feel. The shaver is light and comfortable to shave with--it&#x27;s got grippy surfaces and a few well-placed pins that help your grip. Furthermore, it feels very well-balanced, not too top- or bottom-heavy.&lt;br /&gt;3. Relatively quiet. I&#x27;ve had some electric shavers that perform equally well or even better, but with far more noise. Although not super-quiet, the noise level is respectably within normal decible range.&lt;br /&gt;4. Flip-up trimmer.  It&#x27;s sharp, easy to deploy, and discreetly colored with the accent color (a very dark blue on this model).&lt;br /&gt;5. Charge stand. I actually like that the holster-like charger into which the razor neatly fits) is slightly bulky--it&#x27;s much easier to find and less likely to blend in with all your computer, GPS navigator, mp3 player, electric toothbrush, and other rechargers.&lt;br /&gt;6. Cleaning. Cleans easily with easy removal and replacement of the razor assembly.  Very well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS.&lt;br /&gt;1. Power usage and charging. If you look at the comparison table above, you&#x27;ll see that this has one of the worst hours to charge/house of use ratios.  I&#x27;m not sure I believe it, as I&#x27;ve enjoyed more than 25 minutes on one charge (however, this is a new shaver, and I&#x27;ve heard this will decrease over time).&lt;br /&gt;2. Power.  The chart also shows that this has one of the lowest RPMs of the listed models. However, the \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; gets much better ratings than the razor with 1,000 more RPMs but only two blades.  Most importantly, the razor gives an unexpectedly very close shave; I really can&#x27;t complain, except for...&lt;br /&gt;3. Versatility.  Specifically, the Milano does a very decent but less impressive performance when shaving wet (e.g., in the shower) or when one hasn&#x27;t shaved in a few days. This is not a deal-breaker for me, as it still performs well--just not quite as well.&lt;br /&gt;4. Other.  A pivoting head would be helpful; I sometimes use a circular motion to enhance cutting performance in highly contoured areas and under the nose. Tje charger blinks when charging is done, but the razor doesn&#x27;t blink to let you know it&#x27;s almost out of power.&lt;br /&gt;5. Looks. ALthough I like the design, the material looks like your basic cheap plastic. Form battles substance, and form just barely wins.  Not the electric razor to impress the neighbors with (if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line.  An all-around winner with a mostly minor flaws/disappointments.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this the past month and have no serious complaints; in fact, I was pleasantly surprised with its performance given the somewhat overall cheap look of the plastic material. The \\&quot;hand feel,\\&quot; convenience, and close shave make this a recommended product. If you look at the comparison table, you can get some more convenience features, shorter recharge time, longer use, and more power from other Panasonic products, but they&#x27;re going to cost an extra $25 to $30 (and up) more.  If you want to spend more, get those.  IF this is in your price range, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;2. Power.st RPMs of the listed models.

    <li> I am 46 years old and have used for most of my life the Philips Norelco three blade rotary shavers.  They have always done a good job and lasted for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this Panasonic shaver for the last three weeks, using it exclusively in order to give it a totally unbiased and good review.  Here is what I have after the three weeks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The design is awesome.  It fits great in my hand as I use it.  It adjusts well in my hand as I shave all over my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Unlike the Norelco, it has a great charging station that keeps it upright and neat on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It does a good job shaving dry.  That&#x27;s the way that I usually shave.  The blades do a sufficient job shaving my face as long as I don&#x27;t go over one day without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;4.  By afternoon, I could tell that the shave that I got in the morning was not as good as when I use the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Cleaning is very simple, and it&#x27;s easier than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Used it only once in a wet situation, and it worked.  But like the dry shaving, by afternoon I thought it didn&#x27;t work as well as the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;7.  Now here is the BIG issue!  I have a goatee.  I usually use my NOrelco&#x27;s backside, the trimmer, to keep my beard trim.  So when I tried to use the Panasonic&#x27;s backside trimmer, I was shocked.  It didn&#x27;t do anything.  It just skipped over the whiskers.  I thought I was doing something wrong, but after several tries, the trimmer was only good for keeping my sideburns cut at a straight angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it as a secondary shaver.  I will pack it in my travel case.  It charges quickly, so it will be fine for that.  Great design, OK shave, crappy trimmer.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Panasonic ES-Sl41-W Shaver, Milano Men&#x27;s Rechargeable with Nanotech Blades, 3-Blade Arc 3 Wet-Dry, White. This product gives a very close, comfortable shave. Even though it is meant to be used for both wet and dry shaves, so far I have only used it dry and it is great. The battery can last almost 2 weeks without being recharged! This is a great feature, since it is not necessary to bring along the charger on most of my trips. One less plug adapter to carry along is always a good thing. The design of the shaver fits perfectly in my hand, and the shaver is easy to empty / clean simply under running cold water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between using electric shavers and traditional razor blades since I started shaving as a teenager in the early 1990s. I&#x27;m starting to come to the conclusion that electric shavers simply provide a different type of shave than a razor and that will always be the case no matter what new technology comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give the Panasonic ES-Sl41-W Shaver a try since I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a new wet/dry shaver for a while. I like close, clean shaves ... meaning I should be able to rub my hands across my face and not feel any stubble. The only way that I have ever been able to get that kind of shave consistently has been with traditional razors (usually the two-blade or three-blade kind). All of the electric shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past left varying amounts of stubble behind after I shaved ... good enough for a quick shave in the car on the way to work but not as close/clean as I would want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As nice as this Panasonic shaver is, it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;direct\\&quot; replacement for a traditional razor if you&#x27;re looking for a close shave. I&#x27;ve found that this shaver works well when I don&#x27;t have time to shave in the morning and need to hop in the car to go to work or catch a flight. The Panasonic shaver is perfect for shaving while you&#x27;re driving to work but if you want to impress your girlfriend or wife with your smooth, soft skin then this isn&#x27;t going to cut it (no pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you can accept the fact that an electric shaver and a razor simply deliver different types of shaves then you&#x27;ll be very happy with this Panasonic shaver. However, if you expect to be able to replace a razor with this and still get that \\&quot;baby smooth\\&quot; shave you can forget about it.</li>
