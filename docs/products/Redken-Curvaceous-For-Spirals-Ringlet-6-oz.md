      <li>Smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>This is a great product for my super curly (and sometimes frizzy) hair that gave my curls definition.  </li>

      <li>This product really helps to make the most of my waves and also leaves my hair silky and shiny.  </li>
      <li>you will be pleased, Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve found for curly hair, after long research and many unsuccessful tries.</li>
      <li>This one has no smell, very light and natural in my hair without being crunchy.  </li>
      <li>This product does a good job and leaves my hair soft, not stiff like some of the no-frizz products do.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>but it is fine and easily weighed down by most styling products.  </li>
      <li>The new formulas do not compare!!!  </li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase more as needed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;m buying it.</li>
      <li>it tends to be more dry and frizzy.</li>
      <li>Best results are to pump a small amount on sopping wet hair, comb through, then scrunch and style.</li>
      <li>This was recommended to me by my sister, and neither of us have really curly hair</li>
      <li>Thanks for offering it still here on amazon.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.</li>
      <li>This product helps control frizz and gives my curls a much softer, controlled look.</li>
      <li>When my hair is straightened and then I wash it from being straight</li>
      <li>Thanks, it&#x27;s what I was looking for</li>
      <li>- I&#x27;ve used other products that work a lot better for a lot cheaper.</li>
      <li>product is definitely better than any other curling product I have used</li>
      <li>I just apply the Ringlet Curl Perfector to wet hair, scrunch it and arrange it, and let it air-dry into large, smooth curls.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m in a rush and need to dry with a diffuser, I get somewhat tighter curls, but still smooth.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product, and will buy it from Amazon forevermore.</li>
      <li>but I was expecting a little bit better results.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find a supplier although it was too expensive for me to re-order.  </li>
      <li>very good for permed hair.....defines curls with just a small amount and does not leave hair stiff......</li>
      <li>new version is in salons for $18.</li>
      <li>So for these days I figured I would use something a little more high end, especially because the reviews were very good.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Fortunately it didn&#x27;t look like much was wasted.</li>
      <li>It gives me soft, defined curls and tames all the frizz!</li>
      <li>This order arrived on schedule and was quickly put to work on my dry hair!</li>
      <li>Redken changed the formula (the blue bottle) and it is not as good as this product plus the smell of the new product is strong and unpleasant.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light ,not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for anyone who has naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and Ringlet</li>
      <li>The newer version has an unbearable smell and did not give the natural looking curl.</li>
      <li>My curls and wave (mix) are soft and touchable.</li>
      <li>Yet it leaves hair soft.  </li>
      <li>I am 72 years old.</li>
      <li>The torquise bottle was received.it does not Work nearly as well</li>
      <li>Ringlet lets them softly curl and be manageable.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>You get soft curls without the stiffness.</li>
      <li>Your hairs stays soft.</li>
      <li>I like the old formula</li>
      <li>I have thick frizzy curly unmanageable hair and have tried many curl defining products and combination since I wash my hair and have to re-process in the mornings.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time  and yu don&#x27;t need a whole lot</li>
      <li>This price is a little high but it leaves the shelves fast in beauty supply stores so get it while you can.</li>
      <li>It is really great for the curly look and is not greasy or bad smelling or sticky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since early middle school.</li>
      <li>this is hard to find in stores, so excited to find it</li>
      <li>Thankfully my amazing hair stylist was a curly girl, and knew how to love my unruly locks even when I hated them!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what&#x27;s suppose to, just using a small amount and gives you soft curls you can run your fingers through.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love all the Redken products. And was just introduced to Ringlet Curl Perfection.  After I towel dry my hair, I add a dab of this product and let my hair dry completely.  Then, by hand I  scrunch my hair just a little to loosen curls.</li>
    <li> the product you show in the photo here is what I ordered. You sent another Redken product that is similar but DOES NOT WORK ON MY HAIR! I have been so busy at work that I didn&#x27;t have time to go out and shop for something to work, so I have had to use what you sent, but I am severely disappointed that you didn&#x27;t send what I ordered!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from my hair salon and am in love with it. My hair has become quite curly in my later years (after paying for perms for years, go figure). This product helps control frizz and gives my curls a much softer, controlled look. Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> You get soft curls without the stiffness. I would recommend it for anyone who has naturally curly hair. Redken makes great products.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before, always buying from a salon.  This order arrived on schedule and was quickly put to work on my dry hair!</li>
    <li> I got a perm and they sugested redken ringlet curl protector. I realy like it. I am a person that uses a product for about a month then switch to something differt so I did switch aand I did go back to this product, it keeps your hair in curls.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair but it is fine and easily weighed down by most styling products.  I put this in my hair when it&#x27;s still quite damp after washing then scrunch it and let it air dry. This product really helps to make the most of my waves and also leaves my hair silky and shiny.  It does not add any noticeable weight or stiffness.  The consistency is similar to the slippery serum products like Frizz-Ease.  It&#x27;s expensive but well worth the cost and you don&#x27;t need a lot so it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I am 72 years old. I have naturally curly hair. This stuff works. No frizz allowed.Strangers tell me I have good hair now. Cool.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best curl enhancer I have ever used.  I have very thick curly hair and I have used just about everything out there to try and tame it!  Ringlet is light, creamy and has a nice fragrance.  It gives me soft, defined curls and tames all the frizz!</li>
    <li> Love It, have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I immediately experience a great results, my hair condition is improving; I highly recommend this product. you will be pleased, Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a discontinued product that I used for a number of years.  I was happy to find a supplier although it was too expensive for me to re-order.  It was shipped to me promptly.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this product again.  I had the same results with drugstore products that were a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Anything that&#x27;s Redken gets 4* in my book. I love this product as it helps curl your hair and control the curls. No crazy smells and good texture.</li>
    <li> Wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued this product.</li>
    <li> The product that I received was different than what was shown so I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy, unruly hair and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far.  It&#x27;s not perfect, and I still have to use other products with it to tame my locks, but I&#x27;ve tried everything else and this is the one I like best.</li>
    <li> this is hard to find in stores, so excited to find it</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the product. Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued by Redken. That&#x27;s a huge disappointment. Thanks for offering it still here on amazon. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when there is no more :(.  One star removed for the condition it arrived in. It had leaked into the package and was messy when unwrapping. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t look like much was wasted.</li>
    <li> I have very thick bi-racial hair. It has a mind of it&#x27;s own let me tell you. When my hair is straightened and then I wash it from being straight my curls are very nice. On days I go from wearing my hair curly to curly it tends to be more dry and frizzy. So for these days I figured I would use something a little more high end, especially because the reviews were very good.&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely better than any other curling product I have used but I was expecting a little bit better results. I think that it did define my curls better, but I still was left with a good amount of frizz accompanied with the curls.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I would re-purchase, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it and giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length wavy/curly hair and it is hard for me to find a product that will tame the frizzies.  This product does a good job and leaves my hair soft, not stiff like some of the no-frizz products do.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years</li>
    <li> So bad they discontinued this stuff. I LOVE it. Does not make hair crunchy or wet looking or stiff.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for me. I have my hair permed into lots of curls and Ringlet lets them softly curl and be manageable. Love it.</li>
    <li> very good for permed hair.....defines curls with just a small amount and does not leave hair stiff......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since early middle school. Thankfully my amazing hair stylist was a curly girl, and knew how to love my unruly locks even when I hated them! Now almost 25, it is still my go-to for beautiful hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from the flat iron and blow dryer ladies! For the best curls, I put 3-4 squirts into my palm, run it through all the layers of my hair while scrunching all the time, pin my hair up on the top of my head in layers like a princess, and let it air dry. Always looks nice up or down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and will buy it from Amazon forevermore. (You save a lot!!)&lt;br /&gt;I have always had extremely thick (but fine), frizzy, wavy brown hair of varying long lengths (shortest was shoulders, longest was lower back when straightened). This product feels and smells great, enhances and adds definition to to my curls and makes my hair looks good, and contains my frizz without feeling gross, heavy, or tacky like many products. (I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of gunk on my hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, check out [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]] on how to make your waves even more beautiful! It has been a godsend to me. :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your curls!</li>
    <li> Item is as described, and was shipped in a timely manner. I thought after reading all the hype about the product it would work better than others I had tried. I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference. I still like Ringlet, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. It does smell nice though.</li>
    <li> Salon stylists call this type of in-hair hold \\&quot;Product\\&quot;!  This one holds curls even in dry weather for the day.  Yet it leaves hair soft.  I put it on wet hair, toss, and let the curls dry.  The curls might need a little scrunching when dry, but no comb nor brush.  Perf!</li>
    <li> lLove this gel as it holds a blow dry without the stickiness or making your hair greasy and flat. It lasts a long time  and yu don&#x27;t need a whole lot</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my super curly (and sometimes frizzy) hair that gave my curls definition.  Redken changed the formula (the blue bottle) and it is not as good as this product plus the smell of the new product is strong and unpleasant.  I wish this product could be brought back.</li>
    <li> Redken, please, please put this back on the shelves in stores!!!  The new formulas do not compare!!!  This one has no smell, very light and natural in my hair without being crunchy.  The newer version has an unbearable smell and did not give the natural looking curl.</li>
    <li> Thanks, it&#x27;s what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I like the old formula and I paid extra hoping to get the silver product pictured. The torquise bottle was received.it does not Work nearly as well and I am disappointed with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> Although his product smells terrific, it left my hair drier than hay. I was disappointed as I have used other products from this line.</li>
    <li> I love the product. My sister uses it for her wavy hair &amp; suggested I try it&lt;br /&gt;for my curls. It&#x27;s light ,not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.</li>
    <li> I know that product. I have bought it at my hair salon. It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;m buying it. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve found for curly hair, after long research and many unsuccessful tries. I&#x27;m totally happy because I buy it anyway and I found a really good price here.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a better end result from this product.</li>
    <li> I have thick frizzy curly unmanageable hair and have tried many curl defining products and combination since I wash my hair and have to re-process in the mornings.  And this is my second step for in the morning as spritzing and it&#x27;s perfect.  It does exactly what&#x27;s suppose to, just using a small amount and gives you soft curls you can run your fingers through.  Awesome product, worth the money!!</li>
    <li> the product shown is out dated version.  new version is in salons for $18.</li>
    <li> I ordered this upon reading all the wonderful reviews, and I&#x27;m so happy I did. No more crunchy, wet looking hair! My curls and wave (mix) are soft and touchable. Love this stuff :)</li>
    <li> I started using  this product after nexus rejuvaperm (curl energee) went off the market.  I have naturally curly hair and Ringlet gives great definition to my curls but is light and weightless and doesn&#x27;t build up or flake. Consistency is like a very thin lotion. Best results are to pump a small amount on sopping wet hair, comb through, then scrunch and style. This price is a little high but it leaves the shelves fast in beauty supply stores so get it while you can.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well on my hair, bt my sister loved it~</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my sister, and neither of us have really curly hair but when I saw what this did to hers I had to have it! It is really great for the curly look and is not greasy or bad smelling or sticky. It is also very light.</li>
    <li> For this price I would expect a lot better results. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and would not recommend it. It does nothing for curl definition and only moderately controls frizz - I&#x27;ve used other products that work a lot better for a lot cheaper. Also it&#x27;s a tiny bottle for a ton of money.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought a ton of these before it was pulled -- spending 40 for one almost killed me and I got 2 -- the product is THAT GOOD -- Redken needs to bring it back</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and this product gives me full curls. The best part of using this product is that it doesn&#x27;t clump the hair together so you can run your hands through your hair. Your hairs stays soft. My hair dresser loves when I bring this product in. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used to keep my curly hair under control. I have very fine hair that tends to frizz. I just apply the Ringlet Curl Perfector to wet hair, scrunch it and arrange it, and let it air-dry into large, smooth curls. If I&#x27;m in a rush and need to dry with a diffuser, I get somewhat tighter curls, but still smooth. Love it!!</li>
    <li> While I haven&#x27;t found any product to keep my frizzy, curly hair from reacting (frizzing) to tropical humidity and wet fog, this product outperforms everything I&#x27;ve tried to date.  I will definitely purchase more as needed.</li>
