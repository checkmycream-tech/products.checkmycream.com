      <li>My hair looks much thicker and fuller.</li>
      <li>This product really plumps up the hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used everything from Pureology, to Big Sexy, and A LOT of other high-end products in between, but this one is by far my favorite.  </li>

    <li> My hair is extremely fine, but this thickening mousse provides volume and lasting hold.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used for styling my hair.  If your hair is fine, a little goes a long way.  The price in retail stores is $22.00+, so I was thrilled to order it through Amazon for only $14.76, with no shipping charges!!</li>

    <li> I have very fine hair - this was awful, sticky and heavy and left my hair feeling rough. Can&#x27;t even finish the can - giving it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied that I found something that really does what it says it&#x27;ll do :-)</li>
    <li> Gives me volume I want, and hold the body needed all day.  My hair has begun 2 turn gray so this is an added tool.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that will actually give my baby-fine hair body, style, and shape! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> It left my hair stiff and dry feeling but it did add a coating to my superfine hair. So many products that worked great for me have been discontinued. I&#x27;ll keep looking - not planning on reordering.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My hair dresser gave me some and then I had to move away; so glad I can get here on Amazon! It works so well with my super fine thin hair just a little goes a long way and I typically only use after I shampoo and condition...next day I just rinse my hair and can still feel the product working so no need to reapply until the next shampoo day.</li>
    <li> This is  good product.  I have fine hair and it does give it body.</li>
