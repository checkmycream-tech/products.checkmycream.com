      <li>I won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
      <li>I love that it is xylitol based for healthier teeth and reduces ear infections.  </li>
      <li>Cinnamon is my favorite</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the downfall of healthy gum</li>
      <li>I love the flavor.</li>
      <li>I would buy it again if the flavor lasted more than a minute, at that.  </li>
      <li>The cinnamon flavor is slightly better than the spearmint.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed this product.  </li>
      <li>There are better xylitol gums on the market and even tho</li>
      <li>on it Spry :)</li>
      <li>I have also been told Xylitol is safe for diabetics too.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is sugar free and uses Xylitol!</li>
      <li>Non-GMO soy and healthy for your teeth.</li>
      <li>I love the cinnamon taste.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty good stuff, given its oral health benefits.  </li>
      <li>We bought this because our dentist felt it would be excellent as a cavity preventative for people with dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>so you have to chew a lot of it, but it&#x27;s still the best flavor compared to the other cinnamon xylitol gums.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>This gum is easy to use at home</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s still easy to chew for 20 minutes, and even my kids like doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but when I eat something away from home, it&#x27;s not so easy.</li>
      <li>Received package very quickly.  </li>
      <li>and I liked it so much I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I love that I finally have gum I can enjoy- with NO aspartame!!</li>
      <li>I had old orbit gum containers and filled them, they are so handy.</li>
      <li>great flavor, long lasting, good for your teeth and body.  </li>
      <li>This cinnamon flavor lasts longer than the other ones and is great.</li>
      <li>Refreshes my mouth quickly after a meal or drink.</li>
      <li>If you want a quick chew just to get the enzymes going than this is probably for you.</li>
      <li>and super fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite gum(and favorite flavor) by a long shot!  </li>
      <li>Like fresh cinnamon.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>ordered by accident I wanted fresh fruit flavor</li>
      <li>The flavor seems to go very fast</li>
      <li>Good tasting, decent price, helpful for dry mouth (more than regular gum)</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, I would gladly use this product regularly if I could find it retail.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like it during the summer as it&#x27;s too hot.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a bit hot for the kids mouths.</li>
      <li>My local Whole Foods charges around $3-4 more.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that definitively states that xylitol is beneficial to dental health, but the results seem positive...</li>
      <li>The flavor lasts, the price is better, and the texture doesn&#x27;t feel like a dry rubber band, like this does.</li>
      <li>It certainly helps with saliva production.  </li>
      <li>I was new to xylitol gum but a overall pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>You could easily eat the 100 pieces in this container in less than a day just because of the size of the gum, and because the flavor goes so quickly.</li>
      <li>the person who said they can&#x27;t find it in the store, I&#x27;ve seen it in Whole Foods and vitamin stores.</li>
      <li>Like this real well no chemicals.</li>
      <li>And who wants to chew gum for 10 hours anyway.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice way to freshen your breath but doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
      <li>The gum doesn&#x27;t last long in flavor and is a tad tough, but honestly, xylitol is good for your teeth.  </li>
      <li>This gum is great except that the flavor lasts less than 5 minutes and you&#x27;ll need to replace it or just hold off due to the pricing on these canisters.</li>
      <li>but the cinnamon flavor lasted a decent time.</li>
      <li>Makes me feel good that I don&#x27;t have to have the bad stuff to enjoy my gum.</li>
      <li>is a natural sugar, doesn&#x27;t cause tooth decay!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only reason that I don&#x27;t rate it higher.  </li>
      <li>Other then that I love the texture and quality, just wish they had a larger variety.</li>
      <li>(Dentyne Fire is the only sugar-free gum I&#x27;ve found that I really like which doesn&#x27;t contain Aspartame.)</li>
      <li>The cinnamon flavor is soooo natural tasting.  </li>
      <li>Really missed chewing gum when I started eating Paleo last summer -- then I found Spry brand gum and mints --</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the cinnamon taste.  Not too spicy.  This gum really works for bad breath too.  I&#x27;ll always keep this on hand for after meals.</li>
    <li> Spry gum is an excellent product.  My kids chew gum frequently during homework or playtime.  I like this gum because it has no artifical color or ingredients and Xylitol is a natural sugar, doesn&#x27;t cause tooth decay!</li>
    <li> Good tasting, decent price, helpful for dry mouth (more than regular gum)</li>
    <li> This gum is great except that the flavor lasts less than 5 minutes and you&#x27;ll need to replace it or just hold off due to the pricing on these canisters. Other then that I love the texture and quality, just wish they had a larger variety.</li>
    <li> Really missed chewing gum when I started eating Paleo last summer -- then I found Spry brand gum and mints -- Love it!  Flavor doesn&#x27;t last too long, but the cinnamon flavor actually lasts the longest!</li>
    <li> This gum is easy to use at home but when I eat something away from home, it&#x27;s not so easy.</li>
    <li> I would buy it again if the flavor lasted more than a minute, at that.  Not worth it with such short-lived flavor.</li>
    <li> great flavor, long lasting, good for your teeth and body.  Inexpensive....good value.  Repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Small tablets. Refreshes my mouth quickly after a meal or drink. Great cinnamon flavor but not a gum you will chew for a long time.  Non-GMO soy and healthy for your teeth.</li>
    <li> Small pieces. Not very flavorful, flavor doesn&#x27;t last long.  Plus the shipping doubled the price.  I heard Xylitol is good for you but I won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> As an ovarian cancer survivor it is nice to find a sugar I can have!  I have also been told Xylitol is safe for diabetics too.  Spry makes fruit candy also that is hard to eat just one! Received package very quickly.  I am very pleased with the product from this vendor.</li>
    <li> My son continues to have me order this for him.&lt;br /&gt;He says once you start using this gum, you won&#x27;t want any other brand.</li>
    <li> We chew spry 75% of the time.  I love that it is xylitol based for healthier teeth and reduces ear infections.  Cinnamon is my favorite but I don&#x27;t like it during the summer as it&#x27;s too hot.  I keep it for winter and fall.  It&#x27;s also a bit hot for the kids mouths.</li>
    <li> Spry Cinnamon Xylitol gum is a good product and, according to dental experts, great for dental health.  I enjoyed this product.  However I have two problems:&lt;br /&gt;1. I can&#x27;t find it in any retail store and paying $6.00 plus for shipping makes this product expensive.&lt;br /&gt;2. The cinnamon favor fades after a minute of chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I would gladly use this product regularly if I could find it retail.</li>
    <li> The cinnamon flavor is soooo natural tasting.  Like fresh cinnamon.  The gum doesn&#x27;t last long in flavor and is a tad tough, but honestly, xylitol is good for your teeth.  And who wants to chew gum for 10 hours anyway.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> We bought this because our dentist felt it would be excellent as a cavity preventative for people with dry mouth.  It certainly helps with saliva production.  How it helps with cavities is yet to be seen (although Xylitol is a preventative).</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you are a cinnamon flavor person. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I love that I finally have gum I can enjoy- with NO aspartame!! Recently discovered that aspartame is a migraine trigger for me, which meant no more gum. Plus this tastes just like Big Red.</li>
    <li> The cinnamon flavor is slightly better than the spearmint. But the intense flavor of cinnamon lasts about a few minutes, whereas the spearmint lasts about 60 seconds. You could easily eat the 100 pieces in this container in less than a day just because of the size of the gum, and because the flavor goes so quickly. There are better xylitol gums on the market and even tho Spry is a trusted name brand, they dropped the ball on this product. For now, Zylicious made with xylitol is my fav. The flavor lasts, the price is better, and the texture doesn&#x27;t feel like a dry rubber band, like this does. Ugh.</li>
    <li> I tried the xylitol mints ( Xlear Spry Mints) and I liked it so decided to try the gums. I did not find much different than regular gum, except it says sweetened with xylitol, so picked this over the regular gums.</li>
    <li> ordered by accident I wanted fresh fruit flavor</li>
    <li> The best chewing gum in the world. Hands down.</li>
    <li> Great product.....  Too bad the price has gone up beyond the value of the product.  This isn&#x27;t gold people, it&#x27;s gum!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this gum! It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love the taste! and super fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic gum if you are interested in avoiding artificial flavors.  In addition, xylitol is supposed to be excellent for strengthening teeth.  Nice cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> I have heard that a teen was told to chew this to strengthen his teeth before he could get braces.&lt;br /&gt;However, you have to be cautious about keeping this away from your pets - the xylitol is poison to them, I am told.</li>
    <li> So happy to have gum without aspartame or other bad chemicals.  Makes me feel good that I don&#x27;t have to have the bad stuff to enjoy my gum.</li>
    <li> My little sister is in dental school and xylitol is all the rage.  Here&#x27;s my take, I&#x27;ve never studied it or it&#x27;s affects so I&#x27;m unqualified to say whether its dental enhancing effects are verified or not.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that definitively states that xylitol is beneficial to dental health, but the results seem positive...What I can comment on is the taste, and the economics of this gum over other gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister bought a pack of EPIC&#x27;s &amp;#34;Xylitol&amp;#34; brand gum in a wintergreen flavor containing the following:&lt;br /&gt;  - 500 pieces of gum&lt;br /&gt;  - 1.06g of xylitol per piece&lt;br /&gt;  - $48 for the pack&lt;br /&gt;This amounts to $.09/gram of xylitol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spry gum has the following&lt;br /&gt;  - 100 pieces of gum&lt;br /&gt;  - .72g of xylitol per piece&lt;br /&gt;  - $9.95 for the pakc&lt;br /&gt;This amounts to $.13/gram of xylitol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a little more expensive for this gum, but the other is being bought in bulk.. so ehh.  The gum tastes like big red for about 3-5 minutes, (the suggested time to chew xylitol) and then it looses its flavor.  I keep this pack at work and chew gum after breakfast, lunch and coffee.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good stuff, given its oral health benefits.  Xylitol has been proven to prevent bacteria from creating acids that damage teeth, and it helps prevent plaque from adhering to dental surfaces.  It also helps decrease &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; bacteria in the mouth, and it prevents demineralization of teeth, and it even helps re-enamalize teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff tastes good for, well, a minute.  That&#x27;s the only reason that I don&#x27;t rate it higher.  However, it&#x27;s still easy to chew for 20 minutes, and even my kids like doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Amazon price, it&#x27;s a good deal.  My local Whole Foods charges around $3-4 more.</li>
    <li> It is a nice way to freshen your breath but doesn&#x27;t last long.  The flavor seems to go very fast but if you want a breath freshner it works great.</li>
    <li> This gum has flavor that lasts &amp; tastes great! I enjoy the different flavors it has to offer &amp; how it lasts for quite a while, as there are quite a few pieces in the canister.</li>
    <li> Great flavor and convenient packaging.</li>
    <li> By and far the best tasting healthy chewing gum on the market.</li>
    <li> Tastes good for about two minutes, then the flavor dies off. I won&#x27;t be buying any more. I&#x27;ll stick with Dentyne Fire instead. (Dentyne Fire is the only sugar-free gum I&#x27;ve found that I really like which doesn&#x27;t contain Aspartame.)</li>
    <li> This gum tastes great.  It is good for your teeth and does not have artificial sweeteners that can cause cancer or other problems. Two thumbs way UP!</li>
    <li> This gum is awesome. IT DOES NOT LAST LONG so be warned. That&#x27;s the downfall of healthy gum that&#x27;s actually good for your teeth though! Definitely worth it. This cinnamon flavor lasts longer than the other ones and is great.</li>
    <li> I was new to xylitol gum but a overall pleased with the product. It does take some getting used to the rubbery texture and the flavors never last as long and regular stick gum but the cinnamon flavor lasted a decent time. Much better than the fruity flavor that tasted awful after 5 min.I really miss my Wrigley&#x27;s Polar Ice gum but this is a healthier alternative.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find gum without it any more :( I hope the company works on a few things. It gets hard quick and loses flavor very quickly. If you want a quick chew just to get the enzymes going than this is probably for you. A hint of flavor clings to it like a phantom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist had samples at the office and I liked it so much I purchased it. I had old orbit gum containers and filled them, they are so handy. Other than the no aspartame it doesn&#x27;t stand up to softness and flavor of other gum. I will stick with Spry though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work on it Spry :)</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the taste of Spry&#x27;s Xylitol Cinnamon Gum, plus it is great to know that it is good for my teeth, too.</li>
    <li> Long lasting flavor. Tastes great.</li>
    <li> tastes really good. will buy more</li>
    <li> Never had tried this before.  I bought it to help with keeping on my diet and to drink more water!  I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Like this real well no chemicals.</li>
    <li> Good tasting sugarless gum.  I used it when I was traveling and needed to chew and fly. I plan to try other flavors.</li>
    <li> Started chewing only gum with xylitol.  This one has a good flavor.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Has a chemical undertaste that I could forego if it&#x27;s benefits were obvious. Didn&#x27;t help with dry mouth and the cinnamon flavor is like the punchline of the old joke detailing hoydons complaining about the amuse-bouche at a five-star restaurant: &amp;#34;The food was atrocious and there wasn&#x27;t enough of it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> need to get more! Love this flavor!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite gum(and favorite flavor) by a long shot!  I like the fact that it is sugar free and uses Xylitol! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Great flavor and no nutri-sweet!</li>
    <li> Spry is good gum. It is the only cinnamon flavored xylitol gum my husband and I like. My dentist gives it out. I love the flavor. The flavor doesn&#x27;t last real long so you have to chew a lot of it, but it&#x27;s still the best flavor compared to the other cinnamon xylitol gums.&lt;br /&gt;For the person who said they can&#x27;t find it in the store, I&#x27;ve seen it in Whole Foods and vitamin stores. If you Google spry you can get a map that pops up and tells you where in your area you can buy it.</li>
