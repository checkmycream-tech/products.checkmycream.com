      <li>This item is damn amazing.</li>
      <li>good quality stuff, easy to store.</li>
      <li>i love brushes and i own a lot of them.</li>
      <li>I spend a ton of money on make-up brushes so protecting my investment is important!</li>
      <li>You can use each hole for more than one brush.</li>
      <li>Love this brush tree.  </li>
      <li>Excellent way to dry brushes without water dripping into the handle/ferrel.  </li>
      <li>Very usefull and a good deal.</li>
      <li>As a full time make-up artist I am always needing to shampoo my brushes so this brush tree keeps my brushes from falling apart after washing them!</li>
      <li>easy to use and easy to keep.</li>
      <li>It sets up easily and my makeup brushes fit into the silicone slots and stay there until I need them.  </li>
      <li>It was a bit pricey, but given the fact that I used it for washing more than 40 brushes at once, it was definitely  worth the money.</li>
      <li>very useful</li>
      <li>Great for putting my brushes in to let dry after washing them</li>
      <li>I am a professional makeup artist and this brush tree is amazing.</li>
      <li>while this product seems like a good idea and is actually well made, for a piece of plastic</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure OK for drying brushes, though I just lay mine on a dry cloth or in a cup, tops up, and they&#x27;re fine.</li>
      <li>Seriously, One of the best items I think I have ever bought.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>but considering what quality makeup brushes cost, it seems worth splurging for tools to preserve them.  </li>
      <li>Useful and help to protect our brush from water rinse and keep brush shape.</li>
      <li>to be honest the sigma dry and shape is better if used lying flat</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it&#x27;s definitely something you need if you invest in high-quality makeup brushes.</li>
      <li>I love it works wonders, it actually does what it is supposed to do!  </li>
      <li>At first a balked at the price tag ( $40 for a plastic stand?)</li>
      <li>exactly what i ordered and came exactly on the day it said it would.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dreaming of something like this for a while and was very excited to see that it actually exists!</li>
      <li>and i can easily put the brush tree away flat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely what I needed.</li>
      <li>Actually very space-consuming.  </li>
      <li>Tree is very sturdy and well made.</li>
      <li>The silicone grippers work really well and even with a couple brushes in one opening, the brushes are secured well and do not slip.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>artist brushes i find are just as expensive as make up brushes and its so important to take care of them and invest in good brushes.</li>
      <li>i find this thing kind of gimmicky.</li>
      <li>The brushes are dried fast enough, but more importantly they keep their shape.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>By hanging the brushes upside down, the amount of water that can get into the ferrule is minimized—prolonging the lifespan of your brushes significantly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really not a big deal and doesn&#x27;t take away from the functionality of this product, it just means that I will probably keep it all in a large ziplock bag when I want to put it away</li>
      <li>It takes up very little counter space, considering how many brushes it holds, and really works to dry brushes faster.</li>
      <li>I can now wash most of my brushes at once and they dry so fast and take up very little space.</li>
      <li>I felt a little silly at first ordering something like this, but it&#x27;s honestly made cleaning my brushes so much easier.</li>
      <li>The brushes dry really fast.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t seem to be very sanitary having them just laying there wet.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this to makeup artist who need to dry their brushes</li>
      <li>Normally when I wash my brushes, it takes anywhere from 2-3 days for them to dry</li>

<li> It always takes forever when the brushes are laying on a towel to dry</li>
<li> With this the air flows through so they can dry evenly and faster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> it encourages water from your wet bristles to evaporate up into the ferrule.</li>
<li> It also is helpful to the brushes to dry upside down because the glue hold the bristles on and the longer it stays wet</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me.  I wanted to use for brush storage.  Actually very space-consuming.  I&#x27;m sure OK for drying brushes, though I just lay mine on a dry cloth or in a cup, tops up, and they&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> I use this every day! I&#x27;ve been dreaming of something like this for a while and was very excited to see that it actually exists!</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and this brush tree is amazing. I can now wash most of my brushes at once and they dry so fast and take up very little space. It also is helpful to the brushes to dry upside down because the glue hold the bristles on and the longer it stays wet the looser it gets. This product extends the wear of my brushes and makes cleaning fun!!!!</li>
    <li> Great way to wash my brushes!  You should own this for yours!</li>
    <li> I love this brush tree! As a full time make-up artist I am always needing to shampoo my brushes so this brush tree keeps my brushes from falling apart after washing them! I spend a ton of money on make-up brushes so protecting my investment is important!</li>
    <li> easy to use and easy to keep. Useful and help to protect our brush from water rinse and keep brush shape.</li>
    <li> exactly what i ordered and came exactly on the day it said it would. very useful and i can easily put the brush tree away flat</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The Brush Tree can collapse for storage.&lt;br /&gt;- Brushes stay in place. The silicone grippers work really well and even with a couple brushes in one opening, the brushes are secured well and do not slip.&lt;br /&gt;- The brushes dry really fast. Normally when I wash my brushes, it takes anywhere from 2-3 days for them to dry but when I used this, I was surprised to see all my brushes (small and large) dried in about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The only thing that could be a set back is that when you take the bottom apart, you now have 3 separate pieces. It doesn&#x27;t fold into itself or anything. It&#x27;s really not a big deal and doesn&#x27;t take away from the functionality of this product, it just means that I will probably keep it all in a large ziplock bag when I want to put it away so I keep all the pieces together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and/or repurchase if needed.</li>
    <li> Love this! cleaned my brushes at night and placed them on each holder and placed a towel under and let them dry over night and were dry by morning. Highly recommend this to makeup artist who need to dry their brushes</li>
    <li> I saw one of these at a salon and I just had to have one.  It always takes forever when the brushes are laying on a towel to dry and it didn&#x27;t seem to be very sanitary having them just laying there wet.  With this the air flows through so they can dry evenly and faster.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even know they existed.  What a great asset!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Where are you been all my life?!.. Thank you very much! It&#x27;s absolutely what I needed. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> good quality stuff, easy to store.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Excellent way to dry brushes without water dripping into the handle/ferrel.  At first a balked at the price tag ( $40 for a plastic stand?) but considering what quality makeup brushes cost, it seems worth splurging for tools to preserve them.  Tree is very sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> Great for putting my brushes in to let dry after washing them</li>
    <li> i find this thing kind of gimmicky. i used to paint a lot in college. water color and acrylic. artist brushes i find are just as expensive as make up brushes and its so important to take care of them and invest in good brushes. i love brushes and i own a lot of them. for make up and painting. i wash in a good quality hair shampoo, occasionally i will condition and i use a brush guard and then let them dry on the edge of a table on a towel. while this product seems like a good idea and is actually well made, for a piece of plastic it encourages water from your wet bristles to evaporate up into the ferrule. water evaporates up people.  to be honest the sigma dry and shape is better if used lying flat and it dries your brushes faster. take care of your brushes. wipe them down with every use and for natural bristles don&#x27;t wash them too often unless you have too. hakuhodo website has a great section on \\&quot;how to care for brushes\\&quot;</li>

    <li> This item is damn amazing. Seriously, One of the best items I think I have ever bought.  Do not hesitate to buy one, or three.</li>
    <li> bought as gift no complaints</li>
    <li> It was a bit pricey, but given the fact that I used it for washing more than 40 brushes at once, it was definitely  worth the money. You can use each hole for more than one brush. The brushes are dried fast enough, but more importantly they keep their shape.</li>
