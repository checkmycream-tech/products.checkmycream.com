      <li>It feels good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to improve or worsen my skin.</li>
      <li>For starters it smells unbelievably good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Trumper&#x27;s sandalwood skin food, that too causes me irritation (but just a mildly so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lime skin food works perfectly for me</li>

      <li>My shave is more comfortable this way, and the soothing effect afterward is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>

      <li>nice face feel.  </li>
      <li>My kind of company.</li>
      <li>This brand (along with others, like Taylor of Old Bond Street) is excellent.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best aftershave I&#x27;ve used in terms of skin care.  </li>
      <li>it feels great with absolutely zero irritation!  </li>
      <li>I have gone from avoiding shaving to actually enjoying it.  </li>
      <li>but im still expecting to find something better    4/5</li>
      <li>As the title suggests I am in love with this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>There are a variety of scents out there, but the Lime version is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I like the consistency for the most part, except for when it dries - it leaves a sensation that feels almost like being a glazed donut.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s safe to say you will be pleased by the scent.  </li>
      <li>It has a light scent, and is cooling to the face - refreshingly so but not bracing.  </li>
      <li>The refreshing lime scent is light and without a chemical smell.</li>
      <li>Great product, keeps my skin soft in the winter.</li>
      <li>It feels really nice on a freshly shaved face.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very, very mild;  it won&#x27;t overpower your cologne at all.  </li>
      <li>this stuff has a very natural and pleasant citric aroma.  </li>
      <li>nice lime scent........  absorbs FAST..  </li>
      <li>It smells amazing (yet not overpoweringly so), and it leaves my husband&#x27;s skin very silky.</li>
      <li>I use this between my shave oil and shave cream as an extra layer and it works great.  </li>
      <li>however, it absorbs into your skin very quickly and any residual solvent evaporates off equally quickly.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
      <li>Feels great when it hits your face, soothing and cool with a fresh lime scent and it only takes a drop.</li>
      <li>I actually consider this a good thing, as it helps me verify that I have spread it everywhere on my face.  </li>
      <li>No burning if you get to close with the razor but full protection for what ever you may &amp;#34;face&amp;#34;  during the day.</li>
      <li>A lot of people rave about how good it is and how they wish (if they got a smaller bottle) they would have bought the largest they could get their hands on.  </li>
      <li>It is an incredible product that really cleans and softens skin without leaving a mess, and cleanup is easy.  </li>
      <li>A decent lotion can do much better and save $.</li>
      <li>But the scent does fade quickly, and it seems to retain moisture in the skin in spite of that, hence the 5 stars.</li>
      <li>But because the scent dissipates so quickly, I am going to purchase [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>This is my second purchase of this product, I bought the 100 ml bottle and after using this after a straight razor shave and my face felt great.</li>
      <li>I have used many of the high end aftershave products on the market.</li>
      <li>It also produces and great feeling coating on the skin and last of 3 or 4 hours, excellent protection against the cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does not smell like freshly cut lemons the way</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s my pennies worth.</li>
      <li>His face also smells nice and clean after shaving which I appreciate because I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell of the last after shave he used before this.</li>
      <li>I have searched for years to find an after-shave that actually helps my face feel better after a shave.  </li>
      <li>consistency is mainly a gel which I like because it doesn&#x27;t fall out of your hands as you apply it, the scent is a mild lime, not overpowering at all</li>
      <li>I really like the smell!</li>
      <li>It will definitely not conflict with your favorite aftershave.</li>
      <li>I never write reviews on Amazon, but I just wanted to write this to say, if anyone is considering the lime scent, it smells almost exactly like Mountain Dew to me.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s still far better than the old can of foam and multi-bladed razor routine, there&#x27;s always room for improvement.  </li>
      <li>Discovered Trumper Skin Food took first place among a large group of after shave balms.</li>
      <li>I still have a huge amount left</li>
      <li>Nothing much.</li>
      <li>the time of this review, this size is the better value, containing twice as much product as the smaller size for just a few bucks more.  </li>
      <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to really linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this with the Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Limes shaving cream and my husband really likes it.</li>
      <li>and it really helps with firming your skin.</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t take much , about the size of a dime to cover your whole face.</li>
      <li>Not too strong, but not faint and certainly not like medicine or alcohol</li>
      <li>This complete line is such a great product that I highly recommend it to the beginner or the novice who wet shaves.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been a wet shave for a very long time now and have tried quite a number of different aftershaves, but this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The Skin Food aftershave is nice - it comes out of the bottle slightly thinner than lotion, but clear.  </li>
      <li>The product has a lime fragrance but not as strong as I had expected</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>but I would highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>It smells like high quality organic lemons with sugar,  </li>
      <li>I could not agree with those ecstatic statements more now that I have used it a few times.    </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m saving quite a bit of money on blades since I switched to double edge safety razors, so I figure my total shaving budget is about the same, but I&#x27;m getting better results and pampering my sensitive skin with higher quality products like this.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin which mutinies whenever I shave.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I may go back to this product, but I think I&#x27;m going to try some others first.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling after shaving, but I think that it might be something that many people would enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really like the smell, which reminds me of key lime pie.  </li>
      <li>My sensitive skin enjoys Geo Trumpers</li>
      <li>I used the Geo F. Trumper lime shave cream which gave a smooth, slick shave then finished it with the Trumpers skin food.</li>
      <li>Plus, a single bottle really can last a long while if you don&#x27;t apply too much each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just wish the scent would hang around longer as I don&#x27;t generally wear cologne or EDT.  </li>
      <li>On those testimonials along with the history of my extremely sensitive skin I purchased the 200ml bottle even though the price seemed a bit steep for such a minuscule amount of liquid to be smeared on the skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got fairly sensitive skin, so I have an extra hurdle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dry&#x27;s down quickly</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The stuff smells like gourmet lemon meringue pie.  It does not smell like freshly cut lemons the way Tramper&#x27;s lemon shave oil does.  It smells like high quality organic lemons with sugar,  It is an incredible product that really cleans and softens skin without leaving a mess, and cleanup is easy.  I use this between my shave oil and shave cream as an extra layer and it works great.  I totally recommend and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> As the title suggests I am in love with this product.  A lot of people rave about how good it is and how they wish (if they got a smaller bottle) they would have bought the largest they could get their hands on.  On those testimonials along with the history of my extremely sensitive skin I purchased the 200ml bottle even though the price seemed a bit steep for such a minuscule amount of liquid to be smeared on the skin.  I could not agree with those ecstatic statements more now that I have used it a few times.    For starters it smells unbelievably good.  Not too strong, but not faint and certainly not like medicine or alcohol this stuff has a very natural and pleasant citric aroma.  If you don&#x27;t like citrus you&#x27;re not going to be a fan but then you wouldn&#x27;t be reading this review to begin with so it&#x27;s safe to say you will be pleased by the scent.  The real magic happens of course on your skin.  I have very sensitive skin which mutinies whenever I shave.  Bumps, redness, inflammation, you name it.  I have used this as pre and post shave to great effect:  skin behaves.  I have gone from avoiding shaving to actually enjoying it.  Why products like this haven&#x27;t become standard issue is beyond me but I would highly recommend it.  Oh and a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t be afraid of having to buy a new bottle every two weeks or anything.</li>
    <li> Trumper&#x27;s skin food is an excellent post shave lotion    the scent is amazing though i feel it is a bit too greasy feeling. however, it absorbs into your skin very quickly and any residual solvent evaporates off equally quickly.    i use this every single time as an after shave.  best ive tried yet: but im still expecting to find something better    4/5</li>
    <li> It feels good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to improve or worsen my skin. I really like the smell!</li>
    <li> This brand (along with others, like Taylor of Old Bond Street) is excellent.  There are a variety of scents out there, but the Lime version is my favorite.  This acts as a great sealant after shaving and doesn&#x27;t have a burning sensation (unless you shaved too closely, then you may feel some burning).  It feels really nice on a freshly shaved face.  It can be used as a pre-shave.  The scent is very, very mild;  it won&#x27;t overpower your cologne at all.  A little goes a long way, so a bottle of this stuff will last months.    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I read all the hype. Here&#x27;s my pennies worth. The product is way too expensive and  the fragrance goes away in a minute. I still have a huge amount left and I will be darned if I throw it away for the money that was spent on it !</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells amazing (yet not overpoweringly so), and it leaves my husband&#x27;s skin very silky. I admit it--I steal some for myself after I shave my legs, too.</li>
    <li> I have searched for years to find an after-shave that actually helps my face feel better after a shave.  Edge made one with aloe that I used successfully until it was discontinued some 15 years ago.  Since then, I&#x27;ve  gone from one failed experiment to the next.  That is, until I discovered Trumper&#x27;s Limes Skin Food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lime shaving cream by the same brand suggests on the box to use the skin food before and after shaving, which I have found to work well for me, even using a very small amount (less than a dime size drop).  My shave is more comfortable this way, and the soothing effect afterward is the best I&#x27;ve found.  In winter, I will follow up with a quality moisturizer (CeraVe seems to work best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the smell, which reminds me of key lime pie.  The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to really linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complain of the slightly tacky feel when it goes on.  I actually consider this a good thing, as it helps me verify that I have spread it everywhere on my face.  That tacky feeling disappears within mere seconds (less than 30) so I have nothing to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, each bottle is expensive compared to many other products.  But I&#x27;m saving quite a bit of money on blades since I switched to double edge safety razors, so I figure my total shaving budget is about the same, but I&#x27;m getting better results and pampering my sensitive skin with higher quality products like this.  Plus, a single bottle really can last a long while if you don&#x27;t apply too much each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of this review, this size is the better value, containing twice as much product as the smaller size for just a few bucks more.  Using it the way I do, this size should last me a year.</li>
    <li> I got this for a steal so I am even more happy but... This stuff is just incredible! I switched shaving methods recently and had a lot of cuts and burns the first few times but this applied after was instant relief. Even after a shower I would re-apply it and absolutely no irritation. It&#x27;s worth the money! $$$</li>
    <li> Currently renewing my relationship with double edge shaving and no longer purchasing $4.00 cartridges.  Discovered Trumper Skin Food took first place among a large group of after shave balms. I have used balms rather than alcohol based after shaves for 50 years with great results. Trumper feels and smells wonderful. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nothing much. A decent lotion can do much better and save $. Leaves a yellow residue on face</li>
    <li> I have been a wet shave for a very long time now and have tried quite a number of different aftershaves, but this is by far the best. It is damn expensive, but worth it if you can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short 5 stars, nuff said.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Limes shaving cream and my husband really likes it. His face also smells nice and clean after shaving which I appreciate because I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell of the last after shave he used before this.</li>
    <li> Best aftershave product on the market. I have used many of the high end aftershave products on the market. My sensitive skin enjoys Geo Trumpers Skin food the best. It moisturizes well, it smells good, and it feels great. The 200ml bottle will last you a long time. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Feels great on your face. And it doesn&#x27;t take much , about the size of a dime to cover your whole face. You need to take care of your face , you only got one.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave and awesome and refreshing aroma</li>
    <li> read an article saying Trumper was best..it is!</li>
    <li> This product works nicely as a moisturizer. I never write reviews on Amazon, but I just wanted to write this to say, if anyone is considering the lime scent, it smells almost exactly like Mountain Dew to me. I just wish I&#x27;d known that before I ordered it, so I thought I&#x27;d put it out there. But the scent does fade quickly, and it seems to retain moisture in the skin in spite of that, hence the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving a couple of years ago, and continue trying different products as I seek to optimize the experience.  While it&#x27;s still far better than the old can of foam and multi-bladed razor routine, there&#x27;s always room for improvement.  The biggest gap has been in an aftershave product.  I&#x27;ve got fairly sensitive skin, so I have an extra hurdle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skin Food aftershave is nice - it comes out of the bottle slightly thinner than lotion, but clear.  It has a light scent, and is cooling to the face - refreshingly so but not bracing.  It&#x27;s not as soothing as some, but still comforting.  I like the consistency for the most part, except for when it dries - it leaves a sensation that feels almost like being a glazed donut.  Once you stretch your face and crack it, it goes away, but it&#x27;s different from everything else I&#x27;ve tried in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may go back to this product, but I think I&#x27;m going to try some others first.</li>
    <li> The sad truth is everyone&#x27;s skin is different and no review can truly predict how this will react with your face, but for me Trumper&#x27;s Lime Skin Food is absolute perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have strong outbreaks when I used Nivea&#x27;s sensitive aftershave balm,  and similar bad results with Proraso&#x27;s sensitive post shave balm (the white stuff).  I also experience HORRIBLE irritation when I use witch hazel.  I&#x27;ve tried Trumper&#x27;s sandalwood skin food, that too causes me irritation (but just a mildly so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lime skin food works perfectly for me it feels great with absolutely zero irritation!  It also produces and great feeling coating on the skin and last of 3 or 4 hours, excellent protection against the cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy this stuff exists!</li>
    <li> Feels great when it hits your face, soothing and cool with a fresh lime scent and it only takes a drop. Only 4 stars because the scent is fleeting, doesn&#x27;t last.  Conditions the skin really good though and feels great.  Dry&#x27;s down quickly so if you use cologne it won&#x27;t interfere with that scent.  I just wish the scent would hang around longer as I don&#x27;t generally wear cologne or EDT.  I do use it as my daily go to aftershave and it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I like this product, Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Lime Skin Food. It has a great feel when you put it on and it doesn&#x27;t burn like a lot of other after shave products. The product has a lime fragrance but not as strong as I had expected so that&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4-star rating. The bottle appears to be going slowly since it only takes a very small amount. I figure it should last for quite sometime. I know everyone has different skin so their results could be different from mine. But as for me this product is one that I will definitely purchase again. I hope this helps anyone considering purchasing it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VL8ADM Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Limes Skin Food, 200ml]] is a quality product that goes on smooth, protects the pre-shave skin and nourishes and softens the post-shave skin, but if you expect the scent to last more then ten minutes, you will be disappointed. The refreshing lime scent is light and without a chemical smell. It will definitely not conflict with your favorite aftershave. The plastic 200ml bottle will last you a very long time as you only need a small amount. But because the scent dissipates so quickly, I am going to purchase [[ASIN:B000C2FOHU Geo F. Trumper Extract of Limes Aftershave]], it smells that good.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended as a skin protectant.</li>
    <li> As I mentioned in my review of George F. Trumper Lime Shaving Cream, I ordered both the George F. Trumper Lime Shaving Cream and the Geo. F. Trumper Lime Skin Food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used both products as directed, and I used the Lime Skin Food both before and after shaving.  It felt different when applied to the face before shaving than it did when applied to the face after shaving.  It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling after shaving, but I think that it might be something that many people would enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell like limes, so if you like limes you will probably like this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go with the lime shave soap. It smells great and leaves his skin feel great. I bought this as a gift for my husband.</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps my skin soft in the winter. Soothes well after shaving</li>
    <li> nice lime scent........  absorbs FAST..  nice face feel.  what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I nerd out when it comes to shaving.  This is by far the best aftershave I&#x27;ve used in terms of skin care.  I also use it as a pre-shave lotion when I am out of my regular go to product.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product, I bought the 100 ml bottle and after using this after a straight razor shave and my face felt great. I used the Geo F. Trumper lime shave cream which gave a smooth, slick shave then finished it with the Trumpers skin food. This complete line is such a great product that I highly recommend it to the beginner or the novice who wet shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is mainly a gel which I like because it doesn&#x27;t fall out of your hands as you apply it, the scent is a mild lime, not overpowering at all and it really helps with firming your skin. No burning if you get to close with the razor but full protection for what ever you may &amp;#34;face&amp;#34;  during the day. Great scent and great protection, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I read about this company and admire their persistence to keep this company going, especially during WW 2 when their ingredients were hard to find, if you notice their lime packaging is pink, that is due to a shortage of materials during the war, they kept it pink to remind them that you keep going, even during hard times. My kind of company.</li>
