      <li>I am happy about this item.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i am happy with the product and so is my boyfriend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am just delighted about this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Good ones</li>
      <li>, they are all complementary, they are all impeccably good, and the price for this kind of performance is unbeatable.</li>
      <li>nice fragrance, my girlfriend likes it</li>
      <li>This fragrance does absolutely EVERYTHING you expect a top-notch fragrance to do.</li>
      <li>He immediately liked the scent &amp; so did I.</li>
      <li>I have ordered a lot of brand parfumes from Amazon, and this is really the best one I got.</li>
      <li>I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity.</li>
      <li>It has light smell which gives you a good mood</li>
      <li>i got this for my boyfriend when i asked him to prom he loved it and worth the price  </li>
      <li>I shoots out stronger than most cologne or perfumes</li>
      <li>Wear this for more than a decade.</li>
      <li>I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals.</li>
      <li>and it has also got some speciality which makes you feel sexy</li>
      <li>i liked it´s have a good performance , you can buy don&#x27;t worry about its really very quality .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks .</li>
      <li>and he was very excited to get it.</li>
      <li>This one is exceptionally good, so much so that it does compete with the Serge Lutens, Le Labo, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Creed, Montale and Amouage.</li>
      <li>In my rating system, 4 stars goes to a fragrance that is so good that it very clearly will be replaced when the bottle is out.</li>
      <li>&quot; did not turn out to be relevant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, what does Light Essence do for us?</li>
      <li>Fortunately Amazon refunded me.</li>
      <li>It is light, but it is pronounced.</li>
      <li>The quality is absolutely incomparable.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
      <li>Full my expectatativas with respect to the product.</li>
      <li>I am simply blown away how good these fragrances are.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colognes very affordable quick shipping neat packaging.</li>
      <li>The smell is kind of different</li>
      <li>I am absolutely pleased as punch to give such an enthusiastic review for this second fragrance</li>
      <li>So out of the top 25, this is competitive with maybe 15 fragrances, ranging up to $300+ in price, for quality, distinctness, and general pleasure.</li>
      <li>5 stars is \\&quot;completely distinct, unique, and exotic\\&quot; - completely regardless of price, regardless of whether it&#x27;s a designer fragrance or whether it required 20,000 acres of flowers to be pressed into a tiny bottle, it&#x27;s something so good that you really can wear it and enjoy it above all else.</li>
      <li>This can sell for much higher in some department stores.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Good enough to buy again\\&quot; when my collection may be approaching 400 fragrances and grows over time.</li>
      <li>Following \\&quot;Extreme\\&quot;, this is the second Ferrari fragrance I have tried and I am just tickled to death how good it is.</li>
      <li>Out of all of them, the only accord I love and cherish more than any other is the Montale aoud accords.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know whether this is a newly changed box or not, but one thing I can surely tell you is that the fragrance is totally different with my previous 2 bottles of genuine Ferrari light essence.</li>
      <li>What a high bar to set!</li>
      <li>for the Lamborghini fragrances... not so much.</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of Ferrari light essence.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Take note Lamborghini owners... if you aren&#x27;t buying Amouage or something far more rare and elite (and expensive), don&#x27;t buy your own marque&#x27;s fragrances, they&#x27;re miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it is a lot cheaper than buying it from most other places.</li>
      <li>Smells different than the original.</li>
      <li>and I am very excited to try the 2 or 3 other Ferrari fragrances</li>
      <li>The top note is a sour apple, \\&quot;granny smith\\&quot; note.</li>
      <li>it is a must have for those that are looking for a decent, high quality perfume for themselves or gifting.</li>
      <li>:) I recommend iot to all men especially aged 20-35</li>
      <li>It has a distinct topnote, midnote and basenote (a vast majority of designer fragrances do not have this type of thoughtful, careful blending)</li>
      <li>Not too strong, but mild enough to stick around for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Surprisingly, even though this perfume is meant to be \\&quot;for men\\&quot;, I would actually label this perfume as unisex, since it actually has a fruity and light scent that suits both men and women.</li>
      <li>The midnote (and it is distinct from the topnote) is fresh lemon grass with a progressively fading green apple.</li>
      <li>least as claims the label, the Ferrari brand fragrances are blended by Morris in Italy, which appears to have a considerable provenance all its own.</li>
      <li>So far I have only tried Extreme and Light Essence, but I am going to make a special event out of opening the next one!</li>
      <li>I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic \\&quot;woods and spices\\&quot; types (astringent old-man smells), and many \\&quot;red\\&quot; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
      <li>My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It never gets into an attention-soliciting fragrances, but a strong yet subtle floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The basenote has a trailing-off of both the sour green apple and lemon grass and opens up this very subtle soapiness that is purely delightful (as in, Green Irish Tweed is the heavyweight champion in high-quality soapy floral, and this has a completely convincing but subtle undertone of that esteemed fragrance).</li>

<li> Ferrari is among the finest designer fragrances I have had the pleasure to try, Lamborghini is the most average or poor synthetic juice comparable only to the cheapest designer fragrances (e.g., Yacht Man or Adidas) or even dollar store fragrances.</li>
<li> Like most cologne, a little goes a long way, and this should last him 4~5 months at least (he uses it every day!)~</li>
<li> What is not a suspicion is that the atomizer on this cologne does not have the same feel as the same cologne I owned previously.</li>
<li> The cap is a little smaller, and the atomizer is definitely a lot stronger...</li>
<li> the picture looks blue but what i got is Green.</li>
<li> a sort of maybe irrelevant (or, at best, capricious) point by point comparison I&#x27;ve bought up a few Tonino Lamborghini fragrances at the same time and will say that the three I&#x27;ve tried range from mediocre to poor.</li>
<li> also it is cheeper than other sites.</li>
<li> this price (I got it at $26.24, though I&#x27;m aware that Amazon prices fluctuate randomly,)</li>
<li> This year, Ferrari and Frank Olivier are my two biggest \\&quot;hidden gems\\&quot; in the fragrance</li>
<li> The closest one I can think of is Fujiyama Green.</li>
<li> not Yellowish Green, that is Green.</li>
<li> This is a green floral.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s synthetic cloned crap, something that&#x27;s poured out of a vat into 25 different \\&quot;labels\\&quot;, and marked up about 300% of any of the comparable ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I may be crazy, but the smell from this one seems to be a little stronger or possibly mixed with something else; however, they are just suspicions.</li>
<li> I think I got an outright fake.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice fragrance, my girlfriend likes it</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who happened to try it one day from a tester bottle. He immediately liked the scent &amp; so did I. We both knew, he just had to have it after that!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for a friend from overseas, who asked me to try spraying around a bit before I carry it on the plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, even though this perfume is meant to be \\&quot;for men\\&quot;, I would actually label this perfume as unisex, since it actually has a fruity and light scent that suits both men and women. Not too strong, but mild enough to stick around for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price (I got it at $26.24, though I&#x27;m aware that Amazon prices fluctuate randomly,) it is a must have for those that are looking for a decent, high quality perfume for themselves or gifting.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes very affordable quick shipping neat packaging.</li>
    <li> Everything looks legitimate except... I have owned this same cologne before. I may be crazy, but the smell from this one seems to be a little stronger or possibly mixed with something else; however, they are just suspicions. What is not a suspicion is that the atomizer on this cologne does not have the same feel as the same cologne I owned previously. The cap is a little smaller, and the atomizer is definitely a lot stronger... I shoots out stronger than most cologne or perfumes should. On the plus side, it is a lot cheaper than buying it from most other places.</li>
    <li> Great has a very good smell to it. Would buy it again and again. Came be for the time they said it would. Thank you.</li>
    <li> You can tell by the fragrance and lack of Ferrari official product stick. Wear this for more than a decade. Smells different than the original. Fortunately Amazon refunded me. That&#x27;s why I am an Amazon fan.</li>
    <li> i liked it´s have a good performance , you can buy don&#x27;t worry about its really very quality .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks .</li>
    <li> i got this for my boyfriend when i asked him to prom he loved it and worth the price  i am happy with the product and so is my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> The liquid color is different with the picture. I think I got an outright fake. the picture looks blue but what i got is Green. not Yellowish Green, that is Green.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a lot of brand parfumes from Amazon, and this is really the best one I got. It has light smell which gives you a good mood and it has also got some speciality which makes you feel sexy :) I recommend iot to all men especially aged 20-35</li>
    <li> Full my expectatativas with respect to the product.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Ferrari light essence.&lt;br /&gt;However, this one is not the same one as the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a &amp;#34;Ferrari&amp;#34; but &amp;#34;Scuderia Ferrari.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether this is a newly changed box or not, but one thing I can surely tell you is that the fragrance is totally different with my previous 2 bottles of genuine Ferrari light essence.</li>
    <li> A brief blurb to place my fragrance sensibilities: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances. My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;. I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity. I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic \\&quot;woods and spices\\&quot; types (astringent old-man smells), and many \\&quot;red\\&quot; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber. Things often called \\&quot;Desire\\&quot; or \\&quot;Night\\&quot;. I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals. Good ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just delighted about this fragrance. Following \\&quot;Extreme\\&quot;, this is the second Ferrari fragrance I have tried and I am just tickled to death how good it is. This year, Ferrari and Frank Olivier are my two biggest \\&quot;hidden gems\\&quot; in the fragrance world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a sort of maybe irrelevant (or, at best, capricious) point by point comparison I&#x27;ve bought up a few Tonino Lamborghini fragrances at the same time and will say that the three I&#x27;ve tried range from mediocre to poor. They&#x27;re Coty fragrances - you can look up what that means - but, not special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least as claims the label, the Ferrari brand fragrances are blended by Morris in Italy, which appears to have a considerable provenance all its own. The quality is absolutely incomparable. Ferrari is among the finest designer fragrances I have had the pleasure to try, Lamborghini is the most average or poor synthetic juice comparable only to the cheapest designer fragrances (e.g., Yacht Man or Adidas) or even dollar store fragrances. So my superficial \\&quot;Ferrari vs. Lamborghini\\&quot; did not turn out to be relevant. They are in no way comparable fragrances. (Nevermind the cars - another conversation!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Lamborghini vs. Ferrari might be open to debate on a track, but not in their designer frags. Take note Lamborghini owners... if you aren&#x27;t buying Amouage or something far more rare and elite (and expensive), don&#x27;t buy your own marque&#x27;s fragrances, they&#x27;re miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what does Light Essence do for us? It is light, but it is pronounced. It&#x27;s emphatic lightness. The closest one I can think of is Fujiyama Green. This is a green floral. The top note is a sour apple, \\&quot;granny smith\\&quot; note. The midnote (and it is distinct from the topnote) is fresh lemon grass with a progressively fading green apple. The basenote has a trailing-off of both the sour green apple and lemon grass and opens up this very subtle soapiness that is purely delightful (as in, Green Irish Tweed is the heavyweight champion in high-quality soapy floral, and this has a completely convincing but subtle undertone of that esteemed fragrance). It never gets into an attention-soliciting fragrances, but a strong yet subtle floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not recommend this fragrance highly enough, and it&#x27;s a bit on the fence as to whether it deserves 4 or 5 stars. In my rating system, 4 stars goes to a fragrance that is so good that it very clearly will be replaced when the bottle is out. \\&quot;Good enough to buy again\\&quot; when my collection may be approaching 400 fragrances and grows over time. That may be 75 of them, give or take. 5 stars is \\&quot;completely distinct, unique, and exotic\\&quot; - completely regardless of price, regardless of whether it&#x27;s a designer fragrance or whether it required 20,000 acres of flowers to be pressed into a tiny bottle, it&#x27;s something so good that you really can wear it and enjoy it above all else. This one is exceptionally good, so much so that it does compete with the Serge Lutens, Le Labo, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Creed, Montale and Amouage. Out of all of them, the only accord I love and cherish more than any other is the Montale aoud accords. So out of the top 25, this is competitive with maybe 15 fragrances, ranging up to $300+ in price, for quality, distinctness, and general pleasure. I am absolutely pleased as punch to give such an enthusiastic review for this second fragrance and I am very excited to try the 2 or 3 other Ferrari fragrances I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Lamborghini fragrances... not so much. It&#x27;s synthetic cloned crap, something that&#x27;s poured out of a vat into 25 different \\&quot;labels\\&quot;, and marked up about 300% of any of the comparable ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY this one! It is an experience when you apply it, then 10-20 minutes later it&#x27;s a different experience, and the basenote lasts for hours on fabric. This fragrance does absolutely EVERYTHING you expect a top-notch fragrance to do. It has a distinct topnote, midnote and basenote (a vast majority of designer fragrances do not have this type of thoughtful, careful blending), they are all complementary, they are all impeccably good, and the price for this kind of performance is unbeatable. I am simply blown away how good these fragrances are. So far I have only tried Extreme and Light Essence, but I am going to make a special event out of opening the next one! What a high bar to set!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all men. I buy this for my husband. When he runs out I will be purchasing again as well.!</li>
    <li> The smell is kind of different then what I brought from the mall.</li>
    <li> I am happy about this item.&lt;br /&gt;It looks just like in the screen.&lt;br /&gt;And also it is cheeper than other sites.</li>
    <li> This can sell for much higher in some department stores. I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law and he was very excited to get it. Everything shipped in good order and perfectly brand-new as advertised. Like most cologne, a little goes a long way, and this should last him 4~5 months at least (he uses it every day!)~</li>
