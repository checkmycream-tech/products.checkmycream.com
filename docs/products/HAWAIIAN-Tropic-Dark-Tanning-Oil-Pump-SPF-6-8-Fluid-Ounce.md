    <li> Product was just as described and arrived well packaged. Very happy, thank you.</li>
    <li> this stuff makes me breakout like crazy! shoulder,chest,legs..if I touch my face or just happen to touch my chin to my shoulder..I get pimples!! I hate this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I never really had a problem with acne accept when I used this! just to be sure I stopped using it, let my skin clear, then used it again and BAM acne!&lt;br /&gt;plus I don&#x27;t notice any tan!</li>
    <li> Perfect for summer &amp; a great price!!!</li>
    <li> Loved it give a nice tan</li>
    <li> Maybe I didnt stay in the sun enough when we went to Cancun but we had a tan all over. But IT DIDNT DARKEN on the area I applied it to. I need to test it more then I will post an update of this review.</li>
    <li> A bit oily and greasy but good coverage and protection from the sun for a SPF 6 product.  Love the coconut aroma!</li>
    <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted and of course I had to purchase one for myself as well.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> TOO THIN. I FEEL BURNING AFTER 3 HOURS. REAPPLIED AND IN 3 MORE HOURS FELT SKIN BURNING AGAIN. SPF TOO LOW. CONSTANT SHAKING REQUIRED TO KEEP WALNUT JUICE [ ? ]  MIXED WITH OIL.</li>
    <li> Hawaiian Tropic has always been my favorite oil because of the smell. I can&#x27;t figure out why but the last 2 bottles i have received have had a chemical smell rather than coconut. The oil is still great and I like the low spf. It allows me to still tan yet prevents me from getting the lobster effect at first. I generally turn red then brown but with this, I just brown. I just wish I didn&#x27;t need to wash my towels and beach sheets several times to get the chemical smell out of them. What happened to the fresh coconut smell?</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I lay out for about 2 hours and come inside with a tan line!!! After about 4 days I have beautiful sun kissed skin. Also the smell is great and doesn&#x27;t attract bugs.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, price is great</li>
    <li> Great item at a great price!</li>

    <li> This is my favorite product by Hawaiian Tropic. It sprays on easy and smells great love the smell of the islands. I can spend hours in the pool and it will still be on.</li>
