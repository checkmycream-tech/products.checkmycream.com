      <li>Great for fine</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a pocket size but works perfectly for my daily use.</li>
      <li>love this brush:-)</li>
      <li>Going to purchase a couple go combs and display all:)</li>
      <li>I bought it to make myself feel fancy, I should have known better.</li>
      <li>But I love my 2 Mason Brushes.</li>
      <li>Mason Pearson offeres many types of brushes depending on the type of hair you have.  </li>
      <li>I think this is better for thinner, finer hair that is shorter.  </li>
      <li>i use it more than him.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to get my brush in the mail.</li>
      <li>It was first recommended to me by my hair stylist as a truly superior product.</li>
      <li>I could easily carry it in my purse</li>
      <li>and it works well on my fine, medium length hair.  </li>
      <li>he took the last one on a golf trip and it disseappered from the checked luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a great size.  </li>
      <li>The one I purchased is the small one and it is the perfect size for me.  </li>
      <li>Her hair felt so much better after that first use and each time since.</li>
      <li>I would be pretty pleased with the brush.  </li>
      <li>recommend Mason hair brush to everyone who enjoys good quality personal  products.</li>
      <li>It does spread natural oils to make you hair more glossy, but I was looking for something gentle when brushing my hair since I had it highlighted and it became more brittle.  </li>
      <li>pleased with EARLY delivery, no hitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you do not have a sensitive scalp you&#x27;d probably love it.</li>
      <li>that is it nice for smaller hands.  </li>
      <li>It was definatly worth it</li>
      <li>Worth the expense.  </li>
      <li>My mom borrowed it one weekend when she forgot her hairbrush and it took me months to get it back from her because she liked it so much.  </li>
      <li>no more fly away hair and my hair feels so much fuller and healthier!</li>
      <li>If used and cleaned appropriately will last for years and years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I can definitely say that the desired function of distributing natural oils to ends is perfect whereas the plastic brush was not very effective.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought my first brush in Paris 9 years ago and I still have it today.  </li>
      <li>They are handmade in England, (they were when I first started buying them, assume they still are)</li>
      <li>I find my vent brush works better for my long hair.  </li>
      <li>I did have a hair stylist a while back who recommended them for fine hair</li>
      <li>But the high price also gives it higher standards which I felt it didn&#x27;t reach for me.</li>
      <li>A real treat for your head and hair.</li>
      <li>Like it so much</li>
      <li>My sister in law had her purse stolen and this was the one item she really missed.  </li>
      <li>It has held up very well traveling with me.</li>
      <li>However, this one still manage to pull out equal amounts of hairs as my cheap five dollar brush.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if you have extremely fine hair you could use it to give volume at the roots but it just won&#x27;t work with my long hair.</li>
      <li>so I had high hopes however the frizz is overkill.</li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>I had read for years about the high quality of Mason Pearson hairbrushes.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>If you want a full size brush this is not the one for you,but small &amp; powerful!</li>
      <li>I have long thick fine hair and the brush smooths the hair into place like no other brush I own.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are rather stiff and do not feel like boar&#x27;s hair - they are more like plastic to me.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the box to examine the bristles, it seems very clear that they are nylon, not Boar bristle as advertised.</li>
      <li>The Pocket Bristle brush is small but since I didn&#x27;t want to spend more money I went with it</li>
      <li>I was extremely sceptical if it was really worth it to buy a brush that cost so much</li>
      <li>It is just a basic plastic brush, no telling if they bristles are really boar&#x27;s hair, the box just says natural but they seem plastic to me.</li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing a knock off (Master Professional) to the Mason Pearson brush.</li>
      <li>I finally purchased this pocket size and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Even though Amazon has a good price on this hair brush, I still consider it to be an expensive piece.</li>
      <li>I have straight long hair.</li>
      <li>Even my husband , who at first didn&#x27;t share my attachment to these brushes, now refuses to use other brushes.</li>
      <li>it is a nice brush but expensive</li>
      <li>Not a single bristle has fallen out!  </li>
      <li>I should have just purchased the sensitive brush but wasn&#x27;t sure if it would get the job down considering I have thick waist length hair.</li>

<li> Little</li>

<li> I was very disappointed that there is not a word about the \\&quot;All Boar Bristle\\&quot; which I thought is the real value of the brush - not a word on the box and not in the care instruction!</li>
<li> If you have thick hair, you will get impatient unless you find brushing your hair meditative/relaxing - which might not be a bad thing.&lt;br</li>
<li> I was so disappointed how harsh this brush felt on my scalp.</li>
<li> Yes, they are ridiculously expensive, but I had mine for years and they are timeless.  </li>
<li> I was skeptical at the time, but since have purchased two for myself, one for my daughter, one for my husband who has thinning hair.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately the reason I bought the brush changed so I no longer needed it.</li>
<li> Disappointed with brush.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a pocket size but works perfectly for my daily use. I have straight long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting with fly away hair for years.  Little did I realize that I was creating the problem by using nylon combs and brushes.  The Pocket Bristle brush is small but since I didn&#x27;t want to spend more money I went with it and it works well on my fine, medium length hair.  The brush distributes the oils from my roots to the ends as it&#x27;s advertised to do and has changed my hair dramatically!  It&#x27;s an expensive brush but worth it...no more fly away hair and my hair feels so much fuller and healthier!</li>
    <li> I find my vent brush works better for my long hair.  This brush is not worth the money.  it is a nice brush but expensive and I think I can find one that works as good for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> Great brush! It makes my hair shine. Fits perfectly in my make-up case. Know wonder Lady Diana used it. Great for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush:-)</li>
    <li> I bought my first brush in Paris 9 years ago and I still have it today.  I bought another as a gift. This is the best brush on the market.</li>
    <li> Thee statement brush. High quality. Worth the expense.  Perfect for fine hair. Going to purchase a couple go combs and display all:)</li>
    <li> I never thought that anyone can have a favorite hair brush!  But I love my 2 Mason Brushes. Even my husband , who at first didn&#x27;t share my attachment to these brushes, now refuses to use other brushes. Yes, they are ridiculously expensive, but I had mine for years and they are timeless.  I bought these 2 pocket brushes as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Mason hair brush to everyone who enjoys good quality personal  products.</li>
    <li> It is amazing the difference a hairbrush can make.  The one I purchased is the small one and it is the perfect size for me.  I could easily carry it in my purse but I leave it on my dresser.  Like it so much I  bought one for my daughter.  P.S. She loves it, too!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair brush as a gift and I only want all boar bristle as mentioned in the website. The brush arrived well protected from shipping.  There is a piece of \\&quot;The Care and Cleaning of your Hairbrush\\&quot; included, with a lot of emphasis on caring for the pneumatic rubber cushion and the plastic handle.  I was very disappointed that there is not a word about the \\&quot;All Boar Bristle\\&quot; which I thought is the real value of the brush - not a word on the box and not in the care instruction! Even though Amazon has a good price on this hair brush, I still consider it to be an expensive piece. The bristles are rather stiff and do not feel like boar&#x27;s hair - they are more like plastic to me.  I have to return this item and look for another gift.</li>
    <li> If used and cleaned appropriately will last for years and years.  Unfortunately the reason I bought the brush changed so I no longer needed it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get my brush in the mail. When I opened the box to examine the bristles, it seems very clear that they are nylon, not Boar bristle as advertised. I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> What a difference boar bristles make! I retired a Mason Pearson plastic bristle brush because some of the bristles bent and tore out due to my tight packing job on several trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot yet attest to durability, however this time I&#x27;ll pack it in its box with  molded cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely say that the desired function of distributing natural oils to ends is perfect whereas the plastic brush was not very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on boar bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with EARLY delivery, no hitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer.</li>
    <li> This brush is the perfect size to carry in my purse, work bag or gym bag.  It has held up very well traveling with me.</li>
    <li> I actually use this brush to groom my show dogs.  My mom borrowed it one weekend when she forgot her hairbrush and it took me months to get it back from her because she liked it so much.  I ended up buying her one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> this is defiantly a pocket brush..it is small,but lives up to the reputation of Mason Pearson. If you want a full size brush this is not the one for you,but small &amp; powerful!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my wife as a gift.  She had been asking/begging for a Mason Pearson brush for a couple years. She has thin fine hair that is often either pulled out or broken off with her other brushes. This one drastically cuts down on that. Her hair felt so much better after that first use and each time since. I was extremely sceptical if it was really worth it to buy a brush that cost so much thinking I  was just paying for the name. It was definatly worth it and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mason Pearson brushes for approximately 15 years, at least.  It was first recommended to me by my hair stylist as a truly superior product. They are handmade in England, (they were when I first started buying them, assume they still are) I was skeptical at the time, but since have purchased two for myself, one for my daughter, one for my husband who has thinning hair.  Mason Pearson offeres many types of brushes depending on the type of hair you have.  Until you actually use these brushes, it is hard to explain the benefits.  I have long thick fine hair and the brush smooths the hair into place like no other brush I own.  I ordered the recent pocket style to replace one I had lost and carry with me in purse. Price was great, item was received as promised, arrived in perfect condition. Well worth the investment, if you buy one and don&#x27;t lose it, you \\&quot;could \\&quot;easily own it for 20 years!</li>
    <li> Went back to using a regular brush, this one makes my hair frizzy and unmanageable. It is just a basic plastic brush, no telling if they bristles are really boar&#x27;s hair, the box just says natural but they seem plastic to me. I did have a hair stylist a while back who recommended them for fine hair so I had high hopes however the frizz is overkill. Maybe if you have extremely fine hair you could use it to give volume at the roots but it just won&#x27;t work with my long hair. I bought it to make myself feel fancy, I should have known better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my almost bald husband.  he took the last one on a golf trip and it disseappered from the checked luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a great size.  i use it more than him.</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever made.  This is a smaller version, mine stays in my travel bag.  A real treat for your head and hair.</li>
    <li> If you do not have a sensitive scalp you&#x27;d probably love it. I was so disappointed how harsh this brush felt on my scalp. I should have just purchased the sensitive brush but wasn&#x27;t sure if it would get the job down considering I have thick waist length hair. I ended up purchasing a knock off (Master Professional) to the Mason Pearson brush.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at the right price.  Not a single bristle has fallen out!  That is a miracle.  Very good product!</li>
    <li> Great for my baby daughter!</li>
    <li> Disappointed with brush.  It does spread natural oils to make you hair more glossy, but I was looking for something gentle when brushing my hair since I had it highlighted and it became more brittle.  However, this one still manage to pull out equal amounts of hairs as my cheap five dollar brush.  I like that is it nice for smaller hands.  But I also have longer hair (3 inches past my shoulders) and it takes a longer time to brush with these bristles since I have to divide my hair into small sub sections.  It does not seem to &#x27;grab&#x27; your hair but instead sort off glides over it.  Overall, I agree with other reviewers.  I think this is better for thinner, finer hair that is shorter.  If you have thick hair, you will get impatient unless you find brushing your hair meditative/relaxing - which might not be a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;If it was a third of the cost I would be pretty pleased with the brush.  But the high price also gives it higher standards which I felt it didn&#x27;t reach for me.</li>
    <li> My sister in law had her purse stolen and this was the one item she really missed.  Gave to her for her birthday, and she was thrilled.  top quality!!!</li>
    <li> I had read for years about the high quality of Mason Pearson hairbrushes. I finally purchased this pocket size and I really like it. It works beautifully and I love the handiness of the size of this brush. Try one !</li>
