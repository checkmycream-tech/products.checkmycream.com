      <li>Good for hands and face, so gentle and makes my skin soft moist.</li>

      <li>but I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
      <li>I like the scent of this soap and it is very gentle on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I like this hand soap very much and have used some for my face too.</li>
      <li>Very feminine.</li>
      <li>Jason is a responsible company that I trust.  </li>
      <li>It really helps to keep my hands from cracking in the winter.</li>
      <li>I like the gentle nature of this soap</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; soap</li>
      <li>Very calming scent and not overpowering at all.  </li>
      <li>Recently I have not been able to find this in even natural stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even observed my husband (who prefers hand sanitizers usually) washing much more now that this soap is in the bathroom!  </li>
      <li>This soap has a soft delicate scent and is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The smell is kind of subtle, not overpowering or unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this for years and since I have very sensitive skin</li>

      <li>Plus it&#x27;s natural!  </li>
      <li>The scent is light and stays with me for a little while.</li>
      <li>When I use it, it only reminds me of the perfume an older woman might wear.</li>
      <li>Scent light not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Expensive product, but smells lovely and is gentle.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but totally worth it.</li>
      <li>It does not dry out my hands.  </li>
      <li>It is natural and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands.  </li>
      <li>I tried it on my face, thinking that &amp;#34;Rosewater&amp;#34; would be gentle for my dry facial skin, but it is not - my skin felt stretched out and even with immediate application of my regular moisturizer, my skin looked stripped of moisture.</li>

    <li> We love all Jason soaps.  Clean-non residue hands and great scents.  The Rosewater tends to be the strongest scent.  Very feminine.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite hand soap for the bathroom!  Very calming scent and not overpowering at all.  Then again, my spidey senses love roses so I&#x27;m biased :)</li>
    <li> great product and great value!</li>
    <li> Love it . Never plan to be without it</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! A very natural rose smell unlike most rose like products.</li>
    <li> The place I had a massage at had this soap in their bathroom.  It smelled and works great!  Plus it&#x27;s natural!  So glad to find it!</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Scent light not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this soap.  It seems to be very mild.</li>
    <li> Nice soap for kids and adults.  No drying or irritation.  Smells like roses!  Easy to rinse off.</li>
    <li> Lol... My children are much more keen on washing their hands now and I am happy.</li>
    <li> love this handsoap, and jason is a great brand. This soap smells beautiful; the rose smell is a natural rose smell, and doesnt smell synthetic at all, like some rose soaps. An all-natural alternative to store hand soaps. A little pricey but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of this soap.  it is too strong for my taste.  and more words are needed still.</li>
    <li> Smell is fantastic,,,reminds me of roses</li>
    <li> Who has two clean, rose-scented thumbs? This girl! This rosewater soap has filled the pump on my bathroom vanity for over a year now, and I have no intention of changing that. The scent is light and stays with me for a little while. It reminds me of the rosewater my hosts poured on my hands when I visited Morocco. The soap itself cleans well without drying my hands. If you like the smell of rosewater, you&#x27;ll enjoy this soap.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and since I have very sensitive skin it is the one thing that I can use. Recently I have not been able to find this in even natural stores. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Thank you for carrying this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell. Yuck</li>
    <li> I love this hand soap. It is gentle and has a wonderful rose scent. My husband hates it b/c of the smell, but that isn&#x27;t going to stop me from getting it again.</li>
    <li> This soap has a soft delicate scent and is great for my sensitive skin.  The Rosewater is not available where I buy my other Jason soaps. If you like a light rose scent and great soap, you love this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my bathroom. Very nice soothing light scent. I like this hand soap very much and have used some for my face too. All natural and smells great lathers nicely.</li>
    <li> There was a leakage problem with the package came in.</li>
    <li> Love all of their products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Its the only soap I will use at home. It really helps to keep my hands from cracking in the winter. Beautiful scent too.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this soap and it is very gentle on my skin.  I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This review is for Jason Rosewater Soap for Hands and Face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself is nice. Very creamy, and feel great on the skin.  Although it says rosewater, it does not keep the scent with you as I was hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product</li>
    <li> dried up my hands pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Very nice rosewater scent and good cleansing.  A bit disappointed that Jason has altered ingredients since I first began to use this product, but it remains a favorite.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap, as well as the rosewater body wash. Love them.</li>
    <li> I do I do I do!  I cannot get enough rose-scented stuff into my life.  Thanks Jason for continuing to make this lovely rose-scented soap that is just so awesome.  It does not dry out my hands.  It leaves a fresh rose scent.  It is not tested on animals.  It is VEGAN.  Jason is a responsible company that I trust.  All that makes me so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if only Jason would bring back the large-size rose-scented body lotion!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap.</li>
    <li> I put this soap in our liquid soap dispenser in the bathroom and absolutely love it.  I wanted something that smells great and doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients. This Jason soap is perfect. I&#x27;ve even observed my husband (who prefers hand sanitizers usually) washing much more now that this soap is in the bathroom!  Everyone who has come over has commented on the scent!  Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> Jason rose soap is just wonderful. It has a great rose scent that must be&lt;br /&gt;smelt to be beleived. It is a great soap an I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love Jason&#x27;s products.  It is the only hand soap that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands dry after multiply washings.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my face and it is just what i need. not drying and removes make up.</li>
    <li> The smell is kind of subtle, not overpowering or unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it to wash my hands and probably will never use it on my face but it&#x27;s a great hand soap. For the price, I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE this product.  Good for hands and face, so gentle and makes my skin soft moist. Will be checking out other products at this site</li>
    <li> Expensive product, but smells lovely and is gentle. Nothing makes my hands feel nicer...but the price is hefty</li>
    <li> I love rose scents so I love this soap for my hands however it&#x27;s a bit too dry as a facial cleanser. It should be noted that although the Amazon title says it is soap for hands and face, the bottle itself says it&#x27;s only a hand soap. Other JASON pump soaps I&#x27;ve purchased have indicated on the bottle that it was for both, so I don&#x27;t blame the product for being more drying than normal.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It is natural and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands.  I just wish that they had a scent besides rose for the &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; program.  I&#x27;d like to buy other scents, too.</li>
    <li> My Mom always used rosewater and she is 98 with few wrinkles. I bought the Jason Rosewater lotion and now I am trying the soap.  Seems to make my skin very soft. I will continue to use both the soap and the lotion for a long term affect</li>
    <li> This liquid hand soap has a lovely rose scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  You get a generous amount and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; soap but it does the job. I wish they had a refill available.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of soap, this was my first time with the rosewater smell and I don&#x27;t like it, I prefer the tea tree oil or lavender one.</li>
    <li> I like the gentle nature of this soap but I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my face with out make up.  It works well on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this soap because it only vaguely smells like roses.  When I use it, it only reminds me of the perfume an older woman might wear.</li>
    <li> A gentle, wonderful rose scent. Leaves your hands feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;with a delicate scent. This is a product I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described, does what it says it will do.  Cleans hands well and smells great !</li>
    <li> This soap has been mislabled on Amazon&#x27;s site.  The bottle itself indicates it is a hand soap and suffices as such with nothing noteworthy about it.  I tried it on my face, thinking that &amp;#34;Rosewater&amp;#34; would be gentle for my dry facial skin, but it is not - my skin felt stretched out and even with immediate application of my regular moisturizer, my skin looked stripped of moisture. In short, it suffices for hands, but not for face.</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful - not too overbearing - and is gentle on your skin.  Less expensive on Amazon with a subscription than at Whole Foods.</li>
