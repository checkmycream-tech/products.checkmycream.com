      <li>It looks great!</li>
      <li>This product is great!</li>
      <li>Very nicely made for a great price!</li>
      <li>so I did not get a chance to use it yet but looks great.</li>
      <li>Very nice.  </li>
      <li>Looks very nice on with makeup and earrings,just a nice look.</li>
      <li>I wear it at work and all my coworker said it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
      <li>The hair clip bun cover looks good in my hair and easy to put in my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and it takes me no time at all to put in.</li>
      <li>Nice quality for the most part.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It looks cute and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments.</li>
      <li>I like it and going to buy more.</li>
      <li>This is OK, the hair clip bun cover fit</li>
      <li>Neat and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this will fit all of my hair.  </li>
      <li>CHEAPLY MADE</li>
      <li>My hair is quite long, and it contained it beautifully.</li>
      <li>just right on hair with or without the hairclip bowknot attached to it.</li>
      <li>Makes for a very pretty and fast head of hair.</li>
      <li>This bow will not adorn anything - I purchased 3 of these in different colors and will not be able to use them.</li>
      <li>and when i put it on the first time.</li>
      <li>First of all it took 3 weeks for me to get the item</li>
      <li>so takes really long and the product is very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Expected better quality.</li>
      <li>It will tangle and break my hair, but I won&#x27;t be wearing it very often so I can deal with that.  </li>
      <li>I uploaded some pictures that I hope show the product a little better.  </li>
      <li>What you would want to do is clip it into just some of your hair to keep It in place (pull rest of hair back into ponytail/hair tie first.</li>
      <li>I will probably give it to my young daughter when her hair grows out though.</li>
      <li>the clip tab pops out of the main metal if you try to clip a bunch of hair back.</li>
      <li>This is for very short, not thick hair.</li>
      <li>No big deal, just pop it back in and you are ready to go.</li>
      <li>Just the right size for a tight bun.</li>
      <li>I knew that it would be small because of a previous review, but I expected it to be large enough to actually fit a bun in it.  </li>

<li> Way too small to put my hair in.</li>
<li> That is just if you have medium to thick hair.</li>
<li> Terrible ship time - not impressed with product either.  </li>

    <li> Just arrived today so I did not get a chance to use it yet but looks great. Ordered a blue one two but it did not arrived yet.</li>
    <li> Very nicely made for a great price!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  I wear it a lot.</li>
    <li> First of all it took 3 weeks for me to get the item and when i put it on the first time. The clasp broke. It ships from china so takes really long and the product is very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Snood was way too small</li>
    <li> Looks very nice on with makeup and earrings,just a nice look.</li>
    <li> Fell apart before I got to wear it.</li>
    <li> i thought this was a hair net, with a bow in the back, so i gave it to my sister, its a little high priced, but she likes it thats all that matters</li>
    <li> It could have been a little larger but it&#x27;s ok. Not sure if I would buy again. Expected better quality.</li>
    <li> Neat and easy to use. Just the right size for a tight bun. Makes for a very pretty and fast head of hair.</li>
    <li> I wear it at work and all my coworker said it&#x27;s very cute. I like it and going to buy more.</li>
    <li> Nice quality for the most part. the clip tab pops out of the main metal if you try to clip a bunch of hair back. No big deal, just pop it back in and you are ready to go. What you would want to do is clip it into just some of your hair to keep It in place (pull rest of hair back into ponytail/hair tie first. Then gather up the rest of your hair and twist into the snood. That is just if you have medium to thick hair. Probably could just clip back hair with it if hair is thinner. Would buy it again, great price!</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for bows could be smaller but they work</li>
    <li> Snood and barrette can be used apart or connected together. My hair is quite long, and it contained it beautifully.</li>
    <li> I please with my order. The hair clip bun cover looks good in my hair and easy to put in my hair. I will shop again in the near future for an other hair clip bun cover.</li>
    <li> Terrible ship time - not impressed with product either.  Never again. This bow will not adorn anything - I purchased 3 of these in different colors and will not be able to use them.</li>
    <li> I knew that it would be small because of a previous review, but I expected it to be large enough to actually fit a bun in it.  I don&#x27;t think this will fit all of my hair.  I have fine hair but it&#x27;s quite long, so we will see.  Also I thought and was hoping for an alligator clip, but it is barrette clip.  It will tangle and break my hair, but I won&#x27;t be wearing it very often so I can deal with that.  I uploaded some pictures that I hope show the product a little better.  For the price it is a bargain, so I gave 4 stars.  I will probably give it to my young daughter when her hair grows out though.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I bought it to wear when we go out on the motorcycle so my hair wouldn&#x27;t get tangled. It looks cute and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it takes me no time at all to put in.</li>
    <li> This is OK, the hair clip bun cover fit just right on hair with or without the hairclip bowknot attached to it. My concern is my hair on hair clip bun due to the nature of my work as a wait staff. I hope they will also sell just the Hair Bun Cover excluding the Hair Clip attached to it instead of selling it together as an option. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I  received it and once i put it in my hair the net and metal piece the net was attached to came off of the bracket! CHEAPLY MADE</li>
    <li> I have worn the bowknot once.  I wanted it for a play.  The only problem I had with it is the snood gets caught in the barrette when trying to clip.  You need patience to keep trying or someone to help you.  It looks great!</li>
    <li> Way too small to put my hair in. This is for very short, not thick hair. I wish the description was better shipping took a while as well :(</li>
    <li> Unraveled after 3 times of wear.</li>
    <li> shouldn&#x27;t have to say it over and over because I bought several of them. I thought they were snoods and I don&#x27;t wear buns</li>
