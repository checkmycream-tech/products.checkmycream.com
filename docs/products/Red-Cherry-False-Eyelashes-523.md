      <li>These are so soft and light you don&#x27;t even feel like they&#x27;re there!</li>

      <li>I bought a better product from a company through AMAZON that lasts up to 8 times the wear with proper care.</li>
      <li>fast shipping!</li>

      <li>fast shipping and the quality of lashes is good.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>These are a great pair of eyelashes for beginners because the band is clear, thin, and flexible.</li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I love red cherry lashes, 100% human hair, easy to apply, don&#x27;t feel heavy on your eyelids.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day, I just peeled off the glue from the band and they looked just as new as when I took them out of the package.</li>
      <li>for me, i like dramatic lashes, but these are still noticeable and charming.</li>
      <li>This is the first and last I&#x27;ll buy this product.</li>
      <li>These look natural enough but also make you look like you have long, thick beautiful lashes.</li>
      <li>I love these eyelashes for everyday use, not so much &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking because they are a bit long..</li>
      <li>I used the clear DUO lash adhesive</li>
      <li>came early.</li>
      <li>It looks really natural, and I wear them up to 4 times for a pair.</li>
      <li>The look is natural but is dense enough to bold-up a nude-y look.</li>

    <li> awesome price. came early. great quality!</li>
    <li> Great long lashes without over doing ir</li>
    <li> These are not natural-looking lashes BECAUSE they are so long. They are very wispy and cute though- not chunky are cartoon-like.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and the quality of lashes is good.&lt;br /&gt;The style of the lashes matches what I was looking for.  The photo on shown is samll and it looks greenish.  The lashes are black and not for everyday wear.</li>

    <li> This is okay. It&#x27;s like a two times wear. I bought a better product from a company through AMAZON that lasts up to 8 times the wear with proper care. This is the first and last I&#x27;ll buy this product.</li>
    <li> Pretty much and Provide comfort to the eye</li>
