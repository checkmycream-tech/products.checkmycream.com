      <li>I have been using the products about a month now and my hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
      <li>and it was ok.</li>

      <li>and once it&#x27;s in better shape, see if the shampoo/conditioner helps keep it that way.</li>
      <li>Would like it better if it was more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This says it&#x27;s safe for use with colored hair.  </li>
      <li>Many of these types of shampoos are clarifying shampoo&#x27;s which my hairdresser said to stay away from when you color your hair.  </li>
      <li>I am buying more today.</li>
      <li>Many conditioners won&#x27;t get the tangles out after washing, so I can&#x27;t use just anything.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, conditioner, and wellness treatment.  </li>

      <li>The shampoo does take the chlorine out of my hair (can&#x27;t smell it any more), but the conditioner is so so.</li>
      <li>So this product is OK, but not the miracle I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients in the shampoo, and she has had no reaction/allergy to the product.  </li>
      <li>I also love the fact that it is vegan.</li>

      <li>Nice fresh smelling product</li>
      <li>This is pretty amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>This has made a huge difference in just a couple of uses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this for hard water!!</li>
    <li> My 6 yr. old had platinum blonde hair and for the past few summers I&#x27;ve tried all brands of swimmers shampoo, But the green tinge remained. At the advice of my hair stylist I purchased this product while the shampoo and conditioner seemed to only lighten the green. The powder was like a magic serum.  Say goodbye to green hair!!!!</li>
    <li> Working well on this 3x a week swimmer.The extra,weekly,conditioner is marvelous.Might add here that Iam 68 yrs old with dyed hair!</li>
    <li> This has really helped my son&#x27;s hair.  He is a swimmer and in a pool with chlorine everyday.</li>
    <li> Nice fresh smelling product but it did not remove the yellow chlorine color from my white hair.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found to prevent damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have blonde highlighted hair, and due to all the chemicals required to fight a stubborn algae problem in my pool, I ended up with a decidedly green tint. My hair also felt like straw and had no shine. I ordered this kit, hoping it would at least help a little. As soon as I got it, I used all of the products.It immediately took the green out, and my hair felt so much softer. After a couple more uses my hair was completely back to normal - shiny, soft and BLONDE again. I would highly recommend this kit. I think the Wellness Actives packets (looks like bath salts) are the product that really scrubs the green out of your hair, but it all works together to repair/prevent the pool chemical damage. Now I use the shampoo and conditioner after every swim, and I haven&#x27;t had a green hair on my head since! I will use this every year during pool season. Great product!</li>
    <li> Super great for our little swimmer</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner definitely work better than a pharmacy brand shampoo and conditioner. However, the swimmer&#x27;s weekly solution packets are pretty pointless. I&#x27;ve already run through my shampoo, almost done with my conditioner, and only used 1 out of the 4 packets of the solution salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend just buying the shampoo-conditioner package, you won&#x27;t be missing out if you don&#x27;t get the weekly crystals.</li>
    <li> Unlike many reviewers, my hair is red and not blonde, but any redhead can tell you how easily the color fades when hair is abused, plus I was suffering from dry, crunchy, damaged hair from swimming daily in a treated pool, using a spa, and sometimes swimming in the ocean. I gave this product a try, a little afraid that a product that made blonde hair light might strip color from red. I started with the crystals because my hair was super-damaged by this point. I followed with the shampoo and conditioner. After one use, my color held and hair felt much softer and smoother. I have been using the products about a month now and my hair has never looked or felt better. This is the first product I tried that worked -- I&#x27;m not going back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m swimming in a pool 5 times a week.  When I first started swimming only twice a week my hairdresser asked me right away if I was swimming in a pool.  She said when my hair was wet it felt like straw.  Devastated that my new found fitness routine was turning me into the straw man I searched and found this product.  Now I&#x27;m up to 5 times a week and I went back for a hair cut and she asked if I quit swimming...I told her what I was using and she said she&#x27;s going to start recommending it to her other clients.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the trick for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last month and I really like it. It has a very pleasant smell, and my hair looks and feels great after swimming.</li>
    <li> As a swimming family, we swear by this stuff!  Smells great and does a wonderful job cleaning your hair free of chlorine!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long hair that needed care after spending nearly every day in the pool for swim team.  This haircare system worked to detangle and remove chlorine residue from her hair. It left her hair soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and have a swimming pool in my backyard.  I swim laps several times a week for 30-45 minutes.  I also try to keep the chlorine level as low as possible.  I do wear a swim cap and wet my hair before getting into the pool but it is inevitable that my hair absorbs chlorinated water.  I&#x27;ve used Malibu Un Do Goo shampoo for many years and I knew they made a swimmer&#x27;s formula so I purchased this kit soon after buying the house.  The small packets are treatment granules that are mixed with regular water and left on the hair for a few minutes.  This removes any chlorine buildup.  The shampoo and conditioner can be used daily and are very gentle yet thorough.  These products leave my color treated blond hair looking like human hair not like green straw (which is what chlorine does).  My hair is very soft and no one would ever know that I swim regularly.  This is a fantastic kit and one I couldn&#x27;t live without.  It works like magic.  My new stylist said she could not tell that I&#x27;m a swimmer.  If you&#x27;re a swimmer, you will love these products.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old daughter joined the swim team this year. After one week of practice, her hair turned green!!  I purchased this on Amazon and it arrived quickly. Best yet...it did what it promised! After one use, the green from her hair was gone! She practices twice a week and swims on the weekends (pool and ocean). We use the system once a week after practice and she washes with Loreal Paris Kids swim shampoo on the other days. Combined, this product works great on her long, blonde hair! No tangles &amp; a great scent! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My duaghter has such fine hair and the chlorine is so hard on it.  This product does a great job of helping correct the things chlorine does. The weekly chemical remover works right away. I could tell the difference after just one use.</li>
    <li> This is very moisurizing. It is a very good system altogether for rinsing out chlorine and moisturizes in the conditioner process. The conditioner is not good as a leave-in (which is doesn&#x27;t claim to be made for) as it made my hair very crunchy and dry when blowdried. I typically can apply a little conditioner to my hair after the shower for smoothness and a little protectant to the heat styling in a pinch if I don&#x27;t have any other product. This last bit of info might be useful for those who do the same.</li>
    <li> The shampoo/conditioner combo seems to do a decent job cleaning and reviving my often chlorine-infested hair, but I find it has an unusual, plastic-y smell. I don&#x27;t need oranges, but this smell is not so pleasant. I&#x27;m not likely to use this again after I&#x27;ve finished these bottles.</li>
    <li> This is pretty amazing stuff. I haven&#x27;t been swimming for very long, but I have been dyeing and damaging my hair for years. The damage started to become unbearable when I started swimming, so I looked for a swimmers shampoo. I&#x27;m so glad I found this! It seems as though it may even be repairing the pre-swimming condition my hair was in, which was pretty bad. I have far fewer fly-aways and my hair feels soft again, not too dry anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the Wellness Formula since it sound like that really is for chlorine damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;A great product!</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty dry naturally and it becomes even worse with regular swimming.  I recently got back into swimming after years of neglect.  Back in the day I used UltraSwim and it was ok. But the Malibu system is in a completely different ballpark.  It gets the chlorine out and yet doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of moisture.  In fact, I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t need nearly as much conditioner as shampoo.  That&#x27;s the only downside of this packaged deal--you will probably go through the shampoo faster than the conditioner. But it&#x27;s still a good way to try out the whole system, and then you can order more shampoo by itself separately like I did.</li>
    <li> Blondes- here is your solution! My hair has been green from swimming in a chlorinated pool for 1 year. I tried deep conditioners, clarifying shampoos, home remedies. This is the first product I&#x27;ve had that has worked. My first time using I used the shampoo, followed by the deep treatment and the conditioner and noticed that 95% of my problem was solved. Subsequent follow-up with the shampoo and conditioner after every swim has gotten me back to 100% blonde and I plan to use the deep treatments every few weeks.  My daily shampoo and conditioner work much better for shine and softness, so I only use this after swimming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a scuba instructor and I bought this to try to get some of the chlorine out of my hair after spending hours &amp;#34;soaking&amp;#34; in it in the pool while teaching classes.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for the chlorine, I think I&#x27;ll go back to my UltraSwim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Shampoo smells awesome.  Pretty citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;- Conditioner smells awesome.  Pretty creamy vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of the chlorine.  With the Ultraswim, I smell something like a chemical reaction taking place when I put it on my chlorine-water soaked hair.  Not a bad smell, but I swear it smells like it&#x27;s neutralizing the chlorine.  This stuff is just regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;- Conditioner BARELY conditions.  It&#x27;s thin and runny, like the cheapo stuff at a hotel.  I have long thick hair and could barely get a comb through it after using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say buy the UltraSwim shampoo if anything, and skip this stuff, unless what you&#x27;re really looking for is a scented shampoo to hide the smell of the chlorine.  In that case, save your $$$ and buy Herbal Essences or something else that smells pretty.</li>
    <li> Keeps are feeling great, soft and smell free!</li>
    <li> Usually after I swim, my long hair gets dry and tangled. After a few swims, I have to trim the ends of my hair because of how intractable my hair becomes from the chlorinated pool. This brand of shampoo and conditioner had helped keep my hair healthy, shiny, and tangle-free. I use it right after my swims and have no trouble with my hair. I&#x27;m happy about this product! I also love the fact that it is vegan.</li>
    <li> not to conditioning but it does  get rid of the smell of the chlorine and took out the salt from the ocean.</li>
    <li> I like this kit, I have used it immediately after coming out of the pool. It is not drying and it is cruelty free and more natural than other swim shampoos. I don’t know if it rinses out the chlorine any better than other shampoo.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been swimming every day for about a month now.  These products keep her hair shiny and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; free.  I love the ingredients in the shampoo, and she has had no reaction/allergy to the product.  I will continue to use this product even when she does not swim.</li>
    <li> Worked as well as I knew it would!  Definitely got the green tinge out of my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got two young girls in swim team 4-5 days a week.  They use this daily and it is working well for them!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this product. I told him that I did not notice much difference between this and what I had been using. He said, &amp;#34;that&#x27;s the idea&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I just started lap swimming again as my primary workout. I am in the pool a lot and this time I have blonde highlights! I was nervous that my hair would start to turn green from the chlorine. This product works great, 5 weeks later and still no green hair. I really like the smell and the crystals once a week really help to remove build up. Now to be honest my hair is a little dry but I am washing it ALOT, between swimming and normal showering. I think that my hair would be a lot worse if I didn&#x27;t use this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair worse than without it.  First, it has a very unpleasant aroma.  Second, the shampoo is weak and unsatisfying.  I swim 3x a week, and after one week tossed all of this in the garbage.</li>
    <li> My daughter has blonde hair and swims everyday in the summer, her hair always turns green.  We shampoo it, and get it wet before going in the pool but it always turns green.  This treatment is great you see it instantly the green/chlorine coming out.  Make sure to condition after treatment because it can dry out hair!  This one works</li>
    <li> First of all, I like the Shampoo and Conditioner.  My hair is fine and tangles easily, especially during washing.  Many conditioners won&#x27;t get the tangles out after washing, so I can&#x27;t use just anything. I can use this. I play water volleyball 2x a week and I occasionally swim laps for exercise.  The chlorine had taken a toll on my hair.  I could still smell it 2 days after washing as soon as my hair got wet. I finally decided to try some type of shampoo and conditioner made for swimmers. I keep them in my gym bag and just use it after exposure. Many of these types of shampoos are clarifying shampoo&#x27;s which my hairdresser said to stay away from when you color your hair.  This says it&#x27;s safe for use with colored hair.  I&#x27;ve used this a handful of times and I will say that the smell of chlorine has lessened.  The condition of my hair doesn&#x27;t seem any better, but it likely can&#x27;t undo damage that&#x27;s already there.  I will have to cut off some of the damaged ends and once it&#x27;s in better shape, see if the shampoo/conditioner helps keep it that way.</li>
    <li> I got this after I took up swimming after a ran out of another product I used after swimming.  It may have cleaned out the chlorine but it did not leave my hair soft.  There are better products the Amazon carries like Reflect sports shampoo that are far better.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  If my daughter doesn&#x27;t use this shampoo and conditioner during the summer, then her hair will turn green from the swimming pool.</li>
    <li> My gray hair was bushy and standing on end from exposure to chlorine 3+ hours a day. After one shampoo and conditioner use, it feels better and will behave the way it&#x27;s supposed to. It would have been nice to know the weekly treatment isn&#x27;t recommended for gray hair before purchase, but I passed the four packets from the kit on to a colleague who still has pigment in her hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are fine but don&#x27;t take the green out. Just buy the powder packets from Malibu. The powder is great but make sure you let it sit on your hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo. I swim in a saltwater pool 3 days a week and my blonde hair was getting dry even though I wear a cap. This has made a huge difference in just a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> This really works!! While working the treatment packed through my daughters hair, I could actually see them working! We have tried so many home remedies as well as shampoos for blondes....this product worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> got the green out, and worked on the first try!</li>
    <li> It really makes you hair soft, I have pretty thick and coarse hair but I wash my hair after swimming it softens it and keeps from getting too dry.</li>
    <li> Works very well. The crystal packs are cool.</li>
    <li> A great product, not just for use to remove chlorine, but good for the removal of any buildup on hair.</li>
    <li> This kit has managed to keep my tow-headed daughter from turning green again from the pool chemicals. the weekly treatment is awesome</li>
    <li> Nice to know there is something you can do with blonde strands in chlorine.  I swam for a month using this product, and saw very little deterioration of my blonde weave; just fading of color.  I double-process my hair.  I was told by my hairdresser that these types of shampoos are harsh and drying on the hair.  Not to mention chlorine drying your hair out.  My hair just felt soft after using this. I just dyed my hair brown just in case.  No reflection on the quality of the product, but I just need to use shampoo and conditioner for colored hair.</li>
    <li> After trying a few different products (Ultra Swim &amp; Loreal Swim &amp; Sport), I was beginning to think my 5 year old and 3 year old blonde kids were going to have green hair for the summer. On a last ditch effort I bought this kit. The green was gone!! I suspect it was the powder packets, of which I will be buying more ASAP! I&#x27;m so glad we can enjoy our pool without worrying about having two kids with lime green hair!</li>
    <li> I love this for my swimmers hair</li>
    <li> I have long, tangly hair already- so the prospect of dealing with a tangled straw mess after swimming in a chlorinated pool was dreadful. I have used this each time because of the high recommendations. I can say that my hair was disappointingly still tangled and gnarly from chlorinated water. The treatment packets seemed to help a bit. I truly believe that regular shampoo/conditioner would have ruined my hair into straw. So this product is OK, but not the miracle I was hoping for. It smells very pleasant, and I appreciate that it is vegan</li>
    <li> My blonde hair turned severely green from a pool while on vacation in St Croix and this stuff helped so much more than anything else I tried to get the green out.  I also love that this doesn&#x27;t have parable a and is vegan.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! Makes hair soft, smells great, feels like a quality salon product while applying. I am very happy with my purchase. This product does not weigh hair down or leave hair dry. It&#x27;s a good balance. It&#x27;s good for curly hair and won&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.</li>
    <li> Works great.  My hair is no longer dry and damaged.  I never had a problem with green hair but I only swim in my own pool.  Many people think green  hair is caused by chlorine in the water but it is actually a more common syptom of high levels of copper in the water.  Add a copper remover to your pool and your green hair will disappear.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works, thank goodness!  I have light blonde hair and a green tint is NOT pretty.  The shampoo/conditioner smells great and I can actually tell a difference.  I use the weekly treatment as directed and use the shampoo/conditioner one additional time per week with good results.</li>
    <li> Actually worked for me, it got the green from the pool out of my blonde hair!  I love that it&#x27;s vegan, and the conditioner really did make my hair seem all right again, it was so damaged from swimming I was considering a pixie.</li>
    <li> My hair feels amazing after using the shampoo and conditioner.  The wellness treatment is an extra plus.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who swims in a pool should use this product!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, cleans chlorine off.  Nice citrusy scent.  Would like it better if it was more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great for my blond hair. I love swimming every day. Chlorine can strip my hair of moisture and can make blond hair dull. This kit will correct swimmers hair and make it shiny and gorgeous​ again.</li>
    <li> This SAVED my daughter&#x27;s blond hair!!!  It got the green out and better yet -- it&#x27;s made her hair incredibly silky! A must buy for blond swimmers!  The BEST purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on amazon!!</li>
    <li> Works great out getting the chlorine out of my kiddos hair.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome- my daughter swims three times a week. It helps her keep her hair healthy</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super soft, even moreso than before I started swimming again. Love this stuff! It smells SO good!</li>
    <li> As a daily swimmer, in the past I have had the problem of my hair getting dried out and brittle when using normal shampoos and conditioner. So much so that I could not keep my long hair looking or feeling healthy. I wish I had found this product before I cut off all my brittle locks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Malibu Hair Care Kit for 6 months now and my hair is shinier and healthier than ever before! I get more compliments on my hair now than I ever did before, even when I wasn&#x27;t a daily swimmer! I HIGHLY recommend this product to any and all swimmers out there! It has exceeded my expectations, making my hair more lustrous than ever before!</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction.  My daughter loves this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> No green this summer!</li>
    <li> Hair turned green from chlorine even using this shampoo and conditioner EVERY time I swam. No better than any other regular products.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for the &amp;#34;Wellness Treatment&amp;#34; packets. Well I always read labels. So in tiny little fine print it says &amp;#34;not for white, gray, or non pigmented hair&amp;#34;. Well it would have been nice to know that, given 90% of my hair is white. I&#x27;m 60, but lost my hair color very early. I&#x27;ve been swimming twice a week and noted my hair getting dry. So I guess I have to keep looking but in the meantime, I wish this description had been clearer so would not have wasted my time getting the product and now having to fuss with sending it back. So maybe I could use the shampoo and conditioner but I don&#x27;t trust it, given the packets contain that dire warning.</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast. Great product for swimmers.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner work really well. After swimming every day my hair was getting really dry and stiff.It is now back to normal. Now other people that tried mine at the pool are also ordering it.</li>
    <li> Love it-works particularly well using both.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff. I have bleached platinum highly processed hair. The ends of my hair were green from swimming. I tried baking soda and ultra swim, neither worked. The green was gone from my hair with in 10 mins of using the crystals and my hair color looks better than it did before I started swimming. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but the fruity scent really put me off. Still, I wanted to give it a fair chance. I swim in an outdoor, chlorinated pool, always covering my hair w/ a cap. I wash my hair only a few times a week to maintain the color. After about two weeks I gave up on this product. The shampoo made my scalp itch, and the conditioner left my hair feeling coated, even after multiple rinses. It&#x27;s just not for me. Hope to be able to return it.</li>
    <li> My hair feels softer!!</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s straw hair became soft and manageable again. Although his black hair still has that brownish-blonde tint.  Hopefully, in time, that goes away as well.</li>
    <li> Works great at preventing and treating the green hair blondes get from chlorine! I have used this for two summers on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner do indeed keep my hair from looking like a bird&#x27;s nest with tangles.  The after swimming concoction does take care of the chemicals from the pool water.</li>
    <li> its good for cleaning hair after swimming but dries hair if used more than once a week.</li>
    <li> I swim daily and have tried a bunch of other swimmer shampoo/conditioners. This one works the best. Leaves hair soft and brush-able. Doesn&#x27;t build up after using for a number of days. My kids use it to and they don&#x27;t complain that it stings their eyes. Bonus: smells great.</li>
    <li> a little pricey, but worth it..</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m Asian and I have the strong, smooth, silky hair and w/ daily swimming work-outs my hair isn&#x27;t damaged from the chlorine.</li>
    <li> Being highly allergic to many products, I purchased Malibu C on the advise of my hair stylist.  Not only did I not have a reaction to it, but the first use achieved the results I was looking for!  A bit pricey, but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Got a good start with this for taking care of my hair however, my stylist thinks my hair is in very good condition.  This product lasts.</li>
    <li> After three months of swimming in a pool my long hair felt like I was combing straw, it&#x27;s kinda to fruity smelling for a guy, but my hair is easy to comb and it cleans the chlorine out well.</li>
    <li> Made hair very coarse and tangled. Smelled awful! Will NOT ever use again and told my hairdresser today.</li>
    <li> It was for my grandson who plays Water Polo and he is very pleased and it works well.</li>
    <li> The best product on the market for the removal of chlorine, salt and build up from children and adult hair. I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands from store quality, salon quality and organic and this line is the best. Leaves hair feeling soft, smooth and manageable.</li>
    <li> The packets work great. The shampoo does take the chlorine out of my hair (can&#x27;t smell it any more), but the conditioner is so so.</li>
    <li> If you have swimmers in your family like I do, you will see that something has to be done about the chlorine and other harsh chemicals in the pool.  This kit, when used on a regular basis, helped my boys hair significantly.  There is nothing like getting that buzz cut at the end of the season, but until then, this will get your swimmer through the season.</li>
    <li> This smells great, feels good, but not sure it really helps much with the green from chlorine. I&#x27;m on the fence about repurchasing but we might try another product from their line. The customer service was excellent.</li>
    <li> Both of my kids use these after swimming and so far so good.</li>
    <li> My daughter spends about 4 months of the year in a pool for swimming on the high school team.  This product does exactly what is says--removes the chlorine and keeps her hair soft and in great condition.  Well worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I use this product ever year in the summer time.  It keeps my hair from turning green from the pool.</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect for my daughters, who swim competitively.  The products smell great and are very effective at repairving chlorine damage.  No more &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;  hair that smells like a chemical bath.  In fact, they are so effective that the shampoo was stolen from their swim bag at a recent meet, so we will be replacing soon!</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair is soft again for the first time in 2 years since starting water aerobics.</li>
    <li> Of all the swim shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best by far. I swim several times a week (sometimes every day), so I really need something that works. I think the shampoo/conditioner work better if you let them sit in your hair for a minute or so before washing them out, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s totally necessary.</li>
    <li> What a difference a shampoo can make! I spend about 3 hours a week in a pool and after one year of consistent swimming my hair became unmanageable. I was suggested to try this product and was impressed. Not only it smells good, but it actually does the trick of removing all the residue from my hair, giving it a soft feel and a healthy look. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair feels no different after using this product. The packages help some but there are only 4.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo and conditioner for my granddaughter who is on the swim-team at school. She loves it. I am buying more today.</li>
    <li> It does work if you leave it set int eh hair with heat for awhile but TERRAX shampoo is better at cleaning the hair on a daily basis when it comes to getting CHlorine out of your hair!  I swim every day and need to keep the green out of my hair and who like to were a swim cap!  WORKS GOOD</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, conditioner, and wellness treatment.  It smells very good and it gets the chlorine out of  my hair  My only complaint is the wellness treatment tends to spill all over the place if you try to mix it in the palm of your hand. I pour the powder and water into a tiny paper cup and mix with my finger.  Then, I scoop it out with my hand and run it through my hair.  It has an almost glue like texture so it isn&#x27;t easy to run through long hair, but it leaves my hair shiny and soft so I don&#x27;t really care that it&#x27;s a little extra work to distribute it throughout my hair.</li>
    <li> I got it for a friend&#x27;s Christmas present.  She is an active swimmer so I thought she might like it.  She absolutely loved it.  She said it was the perfect gift.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  Took all the chemicals out of my hair, leaving it soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Really helped damaged hair from swimming.</li>
    <li> My daughter had crunchy green hair.  I decided to try this and was very impressed.  I used all 3 products the first time and it took the green right out and left little to no crunch in her hair.  We go swimming everyday and the green has not come back, however, her hair is crunchy on the ends.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
