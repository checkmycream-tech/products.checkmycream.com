      <li>That being said, the search for a great foot massager continues because this is not one that I can recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it was amazing!  </li>
      <li>It does make noise, so you have to turn the TV volume up if you&#x27;re using it while watching, but it&#x27;s just a nice luxury at the end of the day!</li>
      <li>It gave us a good run for the amount of use we put it through.  </li>
      <li>Using a good foot massage is a must.  </li>
      <li>so I can get a good nights rest.  </li>
      <li>Forwards backwards, both are good.  </li>

      <li>sure feels great.  </li>
      <li>Very glad I bought it and would buy again.</li>
      <li>This product has sped up the process for sure!  </li>
      <li>It is fantastic!!  </li>
      <li>My friend had a problem with his feet hurting every morning, so I made him use it before going to bed, and once again in the morning, and his feet and calves got better!</li>
      <li>but after a couple of minutes it feels amazing.  </li>
      <li>amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had my reflex roller since 2005 and it works effectively and is going strong!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>As any women who wear some kind of heeled shoes can agree how sore our feet are at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>effective tool to massage the bottom of your feet, spins both ways at variable speeds.  </li>
      <li>The speed adjustment is nice too.  </li>
      <li>She is very happy with it, she says it works very well for her.</li>
      <li>the rolling pressure is very strong and seems to help.</li>
      <li>If they asked for $2 more and used a better quality fabric, would be nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experienced certain problems with this product.</li>
      <li>around you may be able to find a lower price.  </li>
      <li>Love it-</li>
      <li>Excellent massager that can be used on shoulders, back, neck, leg muscles!</li>
      <li>and I won&#x27;t be able to use it anymore as the fabric would be too damaged.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>that I exercise more self control and limit mt sessions to 15 minutes, that has not happened again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>want to make this a gift to every one that I love.</li>
      <li>Love it for every reason.  </li>
      <li>so paid more.</li>
      <li>The space in the middle of the roller is great to massage the sides of your feet and your calves!  </li>
      <li>I found the \\&quot;Foot Log\\&quot;, also sold at Amazon, to be much better even though it&#x27;s not powered.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t work that well for me.  </li>
      <li>if you can&#x27;t go to a Reflexologist, this is next best thing!</li>
      <li>because of the foot condition I have it hurt more</li>
      <li>Now I am glad that I refused the doctor&#x27;s offer to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Love this foot massager, I used it every night :-)</li>
      <li>I returned it, not knowing whether I would find a better substitute.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I tried more things than it recommends</li>
      <li>After a good soak in hot water, boy this roller</li>
      <li>i tried this foot massager and it makes the bottom of your feet feel quite good and the massage is very pleasing.</li>
      <li>There is tremendous opportunity for anyone who really wants to make a great foot massager.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is this easy:  Plug it in.  </li>
      <li>This one works great and the kneading in the middle is much better, stronger, than I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>I use it about 5 minutes once every couple of days and the motor has been running strong for a couple of months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I liked using it when I first got it.</li>
      <li>This works fine</li>
      <li>and it has been working fine.</li>
      <li>The unit started up fine but stopped as soon as my wife put her feet on it.  </li>
      <li>the middle area allows you to stick your foot in there and get the sides of your feet massages which feels great</li>
      <li>But then you start hearing this clicking sound each time the wheels turn.</li>
      <li>Great as a back massager too.  </li>
      <li>but, now she uses it every night and enjoy using it.  </li>
      <li>massager has real power for the kind of gnarly massage that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Definitely worth replacing so we won&#x27;t do without!  </li>
      <li>So I originally bought this on June 24, 2011 and the end date when it quit working</li>
      <li>So, when I found this one, which looks just like the Brookstone one, I was so excited.  </li>
      <li>It is good on lower back,</li>
      <li>but it quickly loosens the foot up and your foot feels like butter when you are done.  </li>
      <li>I got use to it quickly and it reduces a lot of pain.  </li>
      <li>BUT this is smaller and lighter weight while providing the same excellent result!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a great concept, but it needs a little more refinement before it&#x27;s ready for the market.</li>
      <li>This massager really is the next best thing to a professional massage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>to anyone wanting a nice deep massage on their feet.</li>
      <li>I purchased mine from Exciting Products through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The middle part is good at squeezing the back of your neck (but if you have any length in your hair you better put it up or it will snatch it out 4.</li>
      <li>She was not to thrilled to get it as a Xmas present</li>
      <li>Almost one year later, we still have to play nice and share.</li>
      <li>For me it can make your feet more sensitive, so I may use my Medi-Rub massager right after, 6.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The rollers inside the fabric do a good job loosening up my feet, and they don&#x27;t seem to struggle at all doing so like other massagers i&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>As time goes on, we keep reading new reports which show that reflexology and foot massages are far more important than we used to think.</li>
      <li>The protusions of the rolling surface are a little pokey (I guess that&#x27;s something from the \\&quot;science\\&quot; of reflexology), but feels good under foot once you get used to it.      </li>
      <li>cloth cover got a hole the first day.  </li>
      <li>over did it the first time that I used it</li>
      <li>Could not get a higher rating from me.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would change is to add two feet to the power cord and make the cord more supple.</li>
      <li>but we never use anything but the lowest speed and wish the range went lower instead of higher</li>
      <li>the middle area could have been designed better.</li>
      <li>was November 29, 2013, tried different outlets just to make sure, its done.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this foot massager, I used it every night :-)</li>
    <li> Awesome Massager! Everyone in our household uses it. I also purchased another one for my in-laws.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get brookstone massager but I guess they don&#x27;t make it anymore, so I looked it up and found something similar. It works quite like Brookstone. The cover tore at the edges the first time I used it which was disappointing but the company replaced it with a new massager  and it has been working fine. I would say good buy for a very good price!</li>
    <li> because of the foot condition I have it hurt more so I sent it back!</li>
    <li> So relaxing!  As a teacher it&#x27;s just the thing I need after being on my feet!  It feels so good.</li>
    <li> My grandparents had this in Japan, and I used to LOVE using it!!!  Theirs lasted for years (it&#x27;s still working and it&#x27;s been over ten years) without any problems.  I&#x27;m not sure how long this one will last, but so far, so good!    WIth the one in Japan, I used to use it however I wanted to, meaning I didn&#x27;t take any care about how much weight I put on it.  Sometimes, my feet needed a lot of rubbing so I&#x27;d press them onto it.  I read that you shouldn&#x27;t do this for this machine, and I&#x27;m being very careful with it now.    The space in the middle of the roller is great to massage the sides of your feet and your calves!  My feet and calves are pretty thin, so I have to wrap a towel around them so it will get squeezed more tightly.  I see that you can use it on your shoulders and neck if you wanted to, but it&#x27;s kind of hard to set it just right to do that.  There are rollers inside it (imagine a bunch of roller blade wheels, scattered and NOT in a row) that turn forwards and backwards depending on which way you move the switch.    One thing I need to warn you about - if you do it for too long, your feet will feel funny!  One time I over did it and my feet felt like it was swollen.  They didn&#x27;t hurt, but I felt parts of my feet touching the floor that usually don&#x27;t.  It went away maybe a day or so later.      It does make noise, so you have to turn the TV volume up if you&#x27;re using it while watching, but it&#x27;s just a nice luxury at the end of the day! :)  My friend had a problem with his feet hurting every morning, so I made him use it before going to bed, and once again in the morning, and his feet and calves got better!</li>
    <li> I would not suggest anyone to buy this for its inferior quality.  I bought last yr. but didn&#x27;t have a chance to use until this March.  The 2nd day I tried, I heard some cranky noise.  You can&#x27;t ignore it b/c you felt it every time the machine rotated.  I asked my husband who basically can fix anything to check it out.  After he opened it up, he found out there was missing a screw.  B/c I used the pdt. almost a yr. later, I didn&#x27;t ask for a refund or return.  My husband temporarily fixed it, but w/i 3 days the noise backed again.  2 mo. later the whole thing was dead &amp; the fabric was torn.    As any women who wear some kind of heeled shoes can agree how sore our feet are at the end of the day.  Using a good foot massage is a must.  I have a similar one bought from Brookstone almost 10 yrs. ago and am still using it.  Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere any more, not even on ebay.  So, when I found this one, which looks just like the Brookstone one, I was so excited.  To my dismay, look alike doesn&#x27;t mean a squad.  So saving your money for other products.</li>
    <li> Relaxing-only if it does not hurt you. Just keeps rolling. I really don&#x27;t like this product. Used it twice and now its under my bed.  Did not buy from  Amazon so paid more.</li>
    <li> This foot roller is terrific!  So glad it purchased it for my poor flat feet. The kneading rollers are perfect for a DIY reflexology treatment in the comfort of your own home.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a busy Mom, who only has time to use it on the weekends when everyone is out. She is very happy with it, she says it works very well for her.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and it really helped her with her severe foot pain from plantar fasciitis.  She brought it over so I could try it too.  It is fantastic!!  It works great for foot pain, although it&#x27;s a bit painful for our calves.  When we used it for our backs and necks it was amazing!  So I just bought another one for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine from Exciting Products through Amazon.  When I received it I noticed that the box had an \\&quot;already been opened\\&quot; look to it and the inside plastic wrap was torn.  The unit started up fine but stopped as soon as my wife put her feet on it.  There seems to be a bad connection inside.  The instructions are not well translated but you can figure it out if you reread it a few times.  I think it&#x27;s a great concept, but it needs a little more refinement before it&#x27;s ready for the market.</li>
    <li> My wife and I jokingly fight over this. I&#x27;m on it now as I type. We&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and I think it&#x27;s great. When you first start using it, it might be a little too deep-acting but it quickly loosens the foot up and your foot feels like butter when you are done.  The fabric is washable and the unit is well made. The only thing I would change is to add two feet to the power cord and make the cord more supple. But even that won&#x27;t keep me from ordering another one!  -----------------  Update- 12/23/2014  Almost one year later, we still have to play nice and share. Still working without a problem. Love it-</li>
    <li> Prescribed by a doctor, but better than expected.  Have a broken hip and needed a deep massage on the muscles around the incisions.  This does the trick!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Oh wow, this is a real foot pleaser!&lt;br /&gt;I over did it the first time that I used it and my feet were sore the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I exercise more self control and limit mt sessions to 15 minutes, that has not happened again.&lt;br /&gt;I want to make this a gift to every one that I love. This massager really is the next best thing to a professional massage.&lt;br /&gt;I work on my feet 9 to 12 hours daily and usually 6 to 8 hours of that in work boots on a ladder.&lt;br /&gt;The reflex roller Shiatsu massager is sturdy and well built. Looks like it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;This massager has real power for the kind of gnarly massage that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it on my back or neck yet. I keep falling asleep just using it on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;Going to try it on my arm after work today.&lt;br /&gt;The same type of machine was for sale at a local store for more than twice the price that I got mine for.&lt;br /&gt;My feet thank you for such a cool foot pleasure and pain relief device.&lt;br /&gt;The doctor wanted to operate on my foot to fix the numbness in my right big toe.&lt;br /&gt;I am regaining feeling back to that toe and it is starting to feel normal again after using this machine for just a week.&lt;br /&gt;Very amazing. Now I am glad that I refused the doctor&#x27;s offer to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Now I want a machine like this that is the size of a bed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for foot pain.  I use it a couple of times per week, along with ice on my heel.  What a difference this massager has made on my foot.  My whole family uses it, and all like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is this easy:  Plug it in.  Turn it on.  Put your feet on it.  &amp;#60;&amp;#60;Sigh&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to several people.  Could not get a higher rating from me.</li>
    <li> I find that I only use it for my feet or calves.  After a good soak in hot water, boy this roller sure feels great.  I use it after I get in from a run.  Forwards backwards, both are good.  The speed adjustment is nice too.  Havent had any problems with squeaking or with the cover.  If you are like me and wash your feet prior to using this (or if you have clean bare feet), the cover shouldn&#x27;t get dirty.  It is removable for washing should you ever need to..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The left and right side are rollers that massage your feet, the middle is sort of a squeezing motion from both sides so you can put two feet and get a reflexology massage, or put one foot in between in the middle and get a squeezing massage on the sides of your foot.  The middle part does not have the massager for underneath your foot as it gets squeezed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the cord was removable though for better storage but its not, and I wish the power switch wasn&#x27;t so tiny (I can hardly use my toes to slide it to turn on the power).  From the middle position (off), you Slide up for forward, slide down from the middle position for backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this sitting on the floor underneath my calves.  I&#x27;ve gone 15-20 minutes at a time without the machine overheating or squeaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best $90 I spent!  Sometimes you gotta splurge!</li>
    <li> I bought this product when I got 2nd baby.. my legs were so bad swollen, so I used this every night before going bed. it worked good! I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Excellent massager that can be used on shoulders, back, neck, leg muscles!</li>
    <li> I had one like this about 10 years ago. This one works great and the kneading in the middle is much better, stronger, than I thought it would be.  I like that it has an adjustable speed control, my old one didn&#x27;t have that feature.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at making my feet feel good after a hard game of tennis. I can&#x27;t do without it</li>
    <li> I would recommend this item to anyone that has burning feet by the end of the day and has foot problems</li>
    <li> This came in about a week ago, and the first night it arrived I used it for a solid 3 hours straight!&lt;br /&gt;The rollers inside the fabric do a good job loosening up my feet, and they don&#x27;t seem to struggle at all doing so like other massagers i&#x27;ve purchased. The next morning my feet were sore :/ and putting them back on to the massager took a minute of getting used too. But after your warmed up, it&#x27;s heaven again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real critique is that the machine rollers are very hard. People with sensative feet should avoid this product because the rollers will hurt.</li>
    <li> Works great and a great price.  Best foot massager in my view and great for plantar fascitis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the device to massage my feet.  I prefer deep kneading massages and the reflex rollers are good because you can control the pressure by how hard you step on the rollers.  I use it about 5 minutes once every couple of days and the motor has been running strong for a couple of months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the rollers were a bit squeaky.  But it was easily solved by unwrapping the blue cloth cover and spraying some WD40 in the plastic rollers.</li>
    <li> I bought this four months ago for my husband who suffers from plantar fasciitis and we are quite happy with the Reflex Roller by U.S. Jaclean.       The recommended treatment for PF is stretching lengthwise of the foot and its bottom surface.  The rolling action of this device aids in that stretching without effort by the sufferer (he does also do active stretching, so this device supplements, but does NOT replace that).  The protusions of the rolling surface are a little pokey (I guess that&#x27;s something from the \\&quot;science\\&quot; of reflexology), but feels good under foot once you get used to it.      There are also taller wheels on the inside edge of the rollers that are placed at an angle, such that they can knead the sides of your foot, particularly if you put your foot in the middle between the rollers (and your foot is not too wide or narrow).      We have not had any problems so far with the device having used it about fifty times (about 10-20 minutes each time).  It&#x27;s not too loud, we use it while watching TV, yet the motor is strong enough to allow us to apply some pressure for a deeper massage when desired.  The picture on the box shows that you might try to use it to massage calves or other parts of the body, though that might require a little gymnastics.      I also got him one of the simple wood ball roller foot massagers (no motor) because I could buy that local, and this one wasn&#x27;t going to make it in time for Xmas, and while he likes the wooden one, he likes the Reflex Roller much better as it chases away the pain of PF more vigorously.    I gave it fours stars as it could be improved by:    - enlarging the bumps on the rollers (to a size in between the nubs they have and the fatter roller balls you see on wooden manual devices or \\&quot;shiatsu\\&quot; type massagers)    - spring loading the large wheels so the sidefoot kneading action could better accomodate the varying widths of different sections of an individual&#x27;s foot, or different sized persons&#x27; feet (and also reduce concern that the current unforgiving kneading action might go too far and crush the foot)    - it has direction and speed control -- which is GREAT!  but we never use anything but the lowest speed and wish the range went lower instead of higher</li>
    <li> My husband, who works on his feet, loves it. I like it, but the center position which is supposed to give a squeezing pressure seems a little wide for my feet. the rolling pressure is very strong and seems to help. I&#x27;d like it to be able to go a little slower, even on the slowest speed it&#x27;s a little too fast for me.</li>
    <li> Handy when my feet are tired.  The fabric started to wear out with minor holes after only a few weeks of use.  The holes are small but I predict it will get bigger over a short time and I won&#x27;t be able to use it anymore as the fabric would be too damaged.  I would recommend seeing a reflexologist instead but if you want just a home device you can buy this but just keep in mind the fabric issue.</li>
    <li> i purchased this reflex roller massager for my wife as she has been experiencing a bit of discomfort from plantar fasciitus in her heels. she has been using this product for a week and she finds that it brings her feet comfort that in conjunction with stretching and wearing orthodics, appears to be alleviating the pain she has been experiencing. i tried this foot massager and it makes the bottom of your feet feel quite good and the massage is very pleasing. all in all, a quality product that i would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Plantar Fasciitis. I thought it would help stretch the tendons on the bottom of my feet. I found that the rollers under the cloth were too far apart and the rollers moved too fast even on the slowest setting. It hurt my feet too much to use this. If you have less sensitive feet that I do, it might be alright. I found the \\&quot;Foot Log\\&quot;, also sold at Amazon, to be much better even though it&#x27;s not powered.</li>
    <li> The Reflex Roller Shiatsu Massager I purchased is less than one month old and does not work.  I only used 2 - 3 times.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Update:  January 14, 2013.  After 18 months and 7 doctors, I was told I was misdiagnosed with plantar fasciitis.  Instead I have Psoriatic Arthritis.  I have one reflex roller at work and one at home and it relieves the PsA pain immensely.  PsA causes tendons to swell like tendinitis, so anyone with tendinitis may also find relief using the reflex roller.  And anyone who has been diagnosed with plantar fasciitis might want to get a second opinion.  Good luck !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister gave me her reflex roller because she said it was too hard for her feet.  It works great for me - it reduces the pain from my plantar fasciitis.  I use it as soon as I awake in the morning, in the evening and during the day.  I ordered a second one for my office.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say its too \\&quot;pointy\\&quot; and hard and that could be an issue for some people.  I got use to it quickly and it reduces a lot of pain.  It isn&#x27;t curing the plantar fasciitis, but when I&#x27;m in excruciating pain, it relieves 80% of the pain - doesn&#x27;t last the whole day, but I have a very severe, chronic case of plantar fasciitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop around you may be able to find a lower price.  You can check the manufacturer directly for pricing.</li>
    <li> I have had my machine for over 10 years. Used by family and friends and massage clients.  It has not sat idle all these  years.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard and knobby. It creaks and groans when you apply pressure, Would be nice if you could slow it down just a tad...&lt;br /&gt;The cloth cover can be a challenge... AND... it is a blessing to aching feet.  We fight over who gets to use it sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;This machine is a household necessity around here.  Mine died last night while my daughter was using it and we all just cried.&lt;br /&gt;Must replace ASAP.  It gave us a good run for the amount of use we put it through.  Yes, if you have a lot of congestion in your feet, this will be uncomfortable to use because it breaks down the congestion and crystallization.  If you work with it, it will assist in clearing the congestion and increase circulation.  If you can do the work to get past this issue, this machine will become your favorite \\&quot;go to\\&quot; to comfort your feet when there is no one around. Definitely worth replacing so we won&#x27;t do without!  Add the Yahuma body rolling foot waker and you have an unbeatable combo!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all my clients who want to work on foot pain when not receiving Reflexology from me.  Preventative Home care is a must when you have foot pain.  When your feet hurt your whole body hurts (whole body is reflected in your feet)  I use it personally as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my reflex roller since 2005 and it works effectively and is going strong!&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is the cover....it gets caught or rolls off....but this doesn&#x27;t effect the quality of the roller.  You can control speed/direction......all wonderful features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can&#x27;t go to a Reflexologist, this is next best thing!</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product because I had bunion and hammertoe surgery in December 2011.  After foot surgery of this type, it takes a while for nerve regeneration to occur.  This product has sped up the process for sure!  This product has also helped with the tension and soreness in my feet as well.  At first, it definitely tickles but after a couple of minutes it feels amazing.  This product works out all of the soreness and tension that can build up throughout the day.  It also beats paying money at the spa for reflexology.  With this product you can have reflexology every day - and what&#x27;s not to love about that!!!</li>
    <li> This works fine and I liked using it when I first got it. Somehow it&#x27;s now just sitting on a shelf, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the expense. It falls into the category of the exercise equipment we all buy and then don&#x27;t use for long.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend (and have!) to anyone wanting a nice deep massage on their feet. The vibrating type massages just do.</li>
    <li> Simple. effective tool to massage the bottom of your feet, spins both ways at variable speeds.  Very glad I bought it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> After many years of running, I had struggled with plantar fasciitis and related injuries.  However, I am now running again pain-free due to daily use of this reflex roller.  It massages very deeply and helps breaks up the scar tissue and move out the built-up lactic acid in the muscles.  I&#x27;ve had my roller now for over 2 years and I use it almost daily, and the only issue I&#x27;ve had is that the cover ripped off.  However, I just wear socks on it, and think it actually works better without the cover.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> cloth cover got a hole the first day.  Otherwise still working well but wife will need to make a new cover.  If they asked for $2 more and used a better quality fabric, would be nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of these for foot relieve.  It&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t work that well for me.  Reflexology is still my best option.</li>
    <li> So I originally bought this on June 24, 2011 and the end date when it quit working was November 29, 2013, tried different outlets just to make sure, its done. I never did stand up on it, I read reviews on other foot massagers where people stand on them and they break, that is because you stood on it. By the above stop date, the blue cloth and all these blue cloth strings are gone, about 2 months ago the screws fell out of the outer rotating sides, I replaced screws. I paid back then $116.98, so I feel I got my monies worth.&lt;br /&gt;I have fibromyalgia w bulging disks in my back and chronic foot pain. First thing is the cover will come off, so just expect it, mine came off I ripped it off the rest of the way and still used it. I tried more things than it recommends sometimes I didn&#x27;t wear socks, if you do this don&#x27;t let your toes get caught in the outer massager 1. The middle part squeezes your foot however you can put the edges of both your feet in the middle (with your feet facing each other or away from each other or if you have pain between big toe like a callus between big toe and next toe you can put that on the raised part that does the squeezing for the middle), 2. You can put it under shoulder blades as you push back on couch or chair, 3. The middle part is good at squeezing the back of your neck (but if you have any length in your hair you better put it up or it will snatch it out 4. You can put it on your calf muscles (I use the middle part of the machine), 5. For me it can make your feet more sensitive, so I may use my Medi-Rub massager right after, 6. It is good on lower back, my lower back though is very sensitive, so its rather painful, but husband likes it on it his lower back or when he gets one back knot (must be nice to have only one back knot every now and then), 7. It will work anywhere you can get it to balance on your back as you long as you have something to lean again to keep it in place.</li>
    <li> Great as a back massager too.  Product is great.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Tried one of the vibration-only massagers but it didn&#x27;t work for me, in part because of my short legs which caused my leg position to put too much strain on my knees. I returned it, not knowing whether I would find a better substitute.&lt;br /&gt;This one is feeling very good! I have &#x27;nubs&#x27; on the feet of my rolling desk chair that I would use to rub my feet against &amp; thought that I should look for something that might have a similar feeling - this was what I found.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m really really liking this from the get-go (didn&#x27;t like the vibration-only one even from the beginning). I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days, so can&#x27;t yet report on long-term benefits, but short-term I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
    <li> There is tremendous opportunity for anyone who really wants to make a great foot massager. As time goes on, we keep reading new reports which show that reflexology and foot massages are far more important than we used to think. That being said, the search for a great foot massager continues because this is not one that I can recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have some great points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the rotating knows do massage your feet&lt;br /&gt;2) it&#x27;s compact&lt;br /&gt;3) it has separate settings for rotating forwards and backwards&lt;br /&gt;4) the design of this allows people to use it for massaging things like your calves&lt;br /&gt;5) the middle area allows you to stick your foot in there and get the sides of your feet massages which feels great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve experienced certain problems with this product. Those problems wouldn&#x27;t make me feel nervous except that I&#x27;ve seen enough people comment on the exact same complaints. This shows that the problems are systemic. Here are the cons (and they are substantial):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) after using the unit the fourth time, I started to hear the incredibly annoying squeaking that happens all the time. This is clearly a design flaw. Every time the wheel rotates, you hear the squeak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) the middle area could have been designed better. When you stick your foot in it, it feels great. But then you start hearing this clicking sound each time the wheels turn. It sounds and feels like you are breaking the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) although the blue cloth covering the turning knobs hasn&#x27;t ripped or torn, I can easily see this happening in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) although there is a speed dial that can speed up or slow down the speed that the knobs turn and massage your feet, the manufacturer must have some sort of neuropathy. At the slowest setting, it&#x27;s still too fast. When you have a human do a foot massage, they move slowly along the bottom of the foot. This unit is way too fast and there is no way to make it slower.</li>
    <li> old foot massage had a timer with auto shut off.  BUT this is smaller and lighter weight while providing the same excellent result!</li>
    <li> A replacement unit for a much more expensive one that went kaput few years back.  Have not wanted to drop bank on another, so I tried this and am amazed!  Love it for every reason.  Works on my middle back when I run too hard, relaxes my feet when I stand too long.  Half an hour on this machine and I&#x27;m back in full operating mode!  Don&#x27;t deny yourself, get one.</li>
    <li> Great for the feet, but a bit too hard for back and neck!</li>
    <li> I bought this as XMAS present for my wife &amp; me.  She was not to thrilled to get it as a Xmas present but, now she uses it every night and enjoy using it.  I use it everyday too, and it helps my sore feet feel good so I can get a good nights rest.  It was money well spent.</li>
