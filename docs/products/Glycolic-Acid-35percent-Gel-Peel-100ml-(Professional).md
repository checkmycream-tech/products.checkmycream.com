      <li>If you do it once or twice weekly your skin will be very smooth &amp; the pores become finer.</li>
      <li>will do a couple of more peels of this before I step up to a 15% TCA peel.</li>
      <li>I visited the dermatologist so many times and was on antibiotics and spironolactone 150 mg.</li>
      <li>sure you wash off ALL of the acid.</li>
      <li>This one has been my favorite to use after, [[ASIN:B00700H128</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use so many creams, salves, etc.  </li>
      <li>My skin is soooo much better.</li>
      <li>I love this peel for wrinkles (under the eyes) and brown spots.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll love doing peels at home.</li>
      <li>I use much more chemicals on my face than her, so I apply the glycolic 2 - 3 per week, but seldom sleep with it on.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t use it more than that</li>
      <li>I have a lot more confidence knowing that I can safely do chemical peels at home without paying the exorbitant prices at spas and clinics.</li>
      <li>First off, Skin Laboratory is a wonderful company to work with....very quick shipment, packaged well, love the detailed instructions that come along.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best way to brighten my very sluggish, oily skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! Use by Victoria&#x27;s secret models, I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised. But, I was surprised to see how great my skin felt! I had just recently got sunburned and I waited one week, put this on, and my skin was like new! Dry skin was gone and my face wasn&#x27;t red or discolored! No acne! This product really is worth the money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the past and it was great. This is a very weak version. It&#x27;s a big bottle so I&#x27;m going to try using multiple layers and see if anything happens.</li>
    <li> If up you leave on too long, it will burn you. I ended up throwing it away. Didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
    <li> Strong acid that bites. I used this on a pitted scar and it got worse. Inconsistent results for the face for acne scars. But very good for skin tags and discolouration. Can use this in place of lazer for those small skin tags using cotton bud to apply.  Not recommended for pitted scars though. For pitted scars, try Derma Rolling. Use this acid on back and body acne scarring and discoloration.  Cheap and effective solution. If anyone can teach how to use this properly on full face, please advise.</li>
    <li> I have monthly breakouts, mild scarring on my cheeks and my skin is normal to oily and not sensitive.  I&#x27;ve used milder glycolic acid in the past and even had an Obagi Blue Peel several years ago.  I&#x27;ve been using the peel for a few weeks and have noticed the mild scarring on my cheeks is fading. I don&#x27;t think this will get rid of it 100%, but it is helping. It has also evened out my skin tone and has helped with breakouts.</li>
    <li> My facial skin was once compared to orange peel because of large pores.  I have suffered from severe acne problems in my teens also I had some discoloration from sunburn and fine lines and wrinkles from all that smoking(I quit that 2 years ago). That was before I have started using glycolic acid 35% and salicylic acid 20% 100 ml since end of March (thanks for sending them both in one shipping cost). I have used them every Monday(glycolic acid) and Thursday(salicylic acid)for 4 and a half month. The result is INCREDIBLE. My facial skin is SMOOTH and EVEN TONE and most importantly SMALL PORES! At this rate, I think my skin will return to fully normal before these bottles used up.  I copied the product feature down below because what they are saying is all true.  If you have bad facial skin, don&#x27;t waste money on something else.  Use these products!  I now have confidence back and don&#x27;t look down when people look at me because I now have a nice and clean face that is presentable.  The only issue I have is why didn&#x27;t I know about these products before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# Diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen production&lt;br /&gt;# Visibly reduces pore size&lt;br /&gt;# Evens skin tone, minimizing areas of discoloration&lt;br /&gt;# Effectively treats stubborn skin conditions, such as acne and environmental/sun damage</li>
    <li> Despite what the people at those Macy&#x27;s booth tell me, I think this product works great, and it&#x27;s better than the hundreds of dollar worth of crap they sold me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this hoping to clear up my skin of old acne scars and to re-hydrate my skin before my wedding. Unfortunately, my sisters took me to Macy&#x27;s to check out their skin products and their &amp;#34;specialist&amp;#34; warned me against such high % on an Acid peel and said it&#x27;ll do more harm than good. I ended up buying tons of their products. After a few months of use, my wedding day came along and the effects of their products were minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months after the wedding, I finally decided to give this a try, since I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on this. The improvements to my skin was drastic and it worked wonderfully. My skin appears to be a lot nicer and cleaner. Even my crater scars are brought to a minimal. I don&#x27;t recommended leaving this stuff on for too long, and definitely do not do it on a daily basis, but this stuff works very well when paired up with a bit of common sense.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it weekly during winter months for several weeks. I only use it before bedtime. Really helps with any acne and skin turns super soft. I prefer this strength over the 50%, but if you never used it before start with a lower strength and work your way up to this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use it on my clients. I love the product since it gives you a moderate peeling. Just make sure to get the neutralizer to put on after you apply the acid. Do not leave the acid for more than the recommended time or your skin will peel severely &amp; burn. If you do it once or twice weekly your skin will be very smooth &amp; the pores become finer. I highly recommend this product, just make sure to get the neutralizer &amp; follow the directions carefully. The results will be worth the little sting.</li>
    <li> I use to work for a plastic surgeon and have given many chemical peels and did have one my self.  The down time of the peel and the 6 weeks prior to use the Obaji system was too much.  This is gentle yet effective.  YES you have to use it more than once but it has no down time with ugly red and peeling skin.  I get instant softness and gradually I have seen the smoothing of the wrinkles and large pores.  I highly recommend this for weekly use to get the desired results VS a chemical peel.  I will order the stronger strenth when the bottle I am on is gone, but only because I want to get alittle more aggressive.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 items from Skin Laboratory: a) Lactic 35% &amp; Glycolic 25% Combination Acid Gel Peel, b) Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel, c) Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used each peel for 4 weeks, rest 1 week in between, which is important to avoid sensitivity problem. The result from the combo is the worst. If you have acne, Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel works perfectly. It clears my occasional spots and whiteheads instantly. If you have uneven skin tone, large pores or fine lines, Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel brings about a much more dramatic and noticeable effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only criticism is my skin is getting accustomed to this strength and I don&#x27;t see as much of that initial effect.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-forties and have had acne since I was a teenager.  To make it even more fun, my hormones are bouncing all over now and I alternate between greasy skin, acne, dry skin, and have lines forming.  The Glycolic Acid peel is the only thing I have found that works consistently on my skin.  There is some tingling while it is on, but it is not unbearable.  The next day my skin feels noticeably softer and looks smoother.  A great side effect is that the acne is greatly diminished.  I have been using this product about once a week for several months.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Does what it is suppose to</li>
    <li> this helped me reduce the appearance of the stretch marks i have on my legs, i used it weekly for about a month or so and still using it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this 3.4 fl. Oz. size because I didn&#x27;t notice it was still available  in the 1 oz. size that I had purchased in the past.  It&#x27;s from the same manufacturing Skin Laboratories, and is the same glycolic/35 formula on the label, but it did work as well as the 1oz size.  I kept it on for 4 minutes like I had in the past,  and I didn&#x27;t even feel a tingle on my face like I had felt with the smaller size.  I feel either it is watered down, expired or the formulation has changed.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old and have been using this product for a little over a month, once a week.  Today I was outside, with no makeup on and in bright sunlight.  My 27 year old son was in the driveway cleaning my car.  He and I were talking and he looked at me and said my skin was beautiful.  Now anyone that has a grown son will tell you the last thing they expect from their son is a comment like that.  27 year old son&#x27;s just don&#x27;t look at their moms.  So, I guess this stuff must be working.  I have been blessed with fairly good skin, but I was starting to see some signs of aging.  I have a fairly light complexion that burns easily.  I have used sunscreen since I was 13 and I have never had a problem with acne. So I cannot say how it works with acne and all that goes along with that.  I started using this product because my skin was starting to look a little dull and flaky. This has taken care of those little problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will continue to use for a few more weeks and take a month off before I use again.  My skin is smooth, not shiny or tight.  If you expect results right way you will be disappointed.  Just be patient.  Start slowly and use as instructed.</li>
    <li> Hi, I liked this product but I just think that maybe I chose the wrong level for me, but it&#x27;s ok because I prefer to start low just in case:-)&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to be great and it got to me on time and well packed.&lt;br /&gt;My skin did not peel one bit!!! But I did felt the black head coming out...good thing!&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was that it did not do much for me, because I used creams w/acids before, so I guess that got my skin more resilient to acids??. But because it was my first time trying a glycolic gel peel, I was afraid to go to high. So now it&#x27;s time for me to go to the next level:-)</li>
    <li> I chose this product based on its customer reviews and it has really worked for me. My face is very sensitve but I was able to use this product without any problems and v. minimal reddness/irritation. Its also great for rough patches on knees and elbows. I&#x27;ve recomenned this product to my girlfriends as well. Its a a great value. Don&#x27;t forget to use sunblock after your peel.</li>
    <li> This formula contains a concentration of the active ingredient in Alpha-Hydroxy products, which you simply apply, wait, and rinse. I have been using it about twice a week for several weeks now. Though the changes have not been dramatic, I have noticed an increase in my skin&#x27;s overall tone, and am finding that some pigmentation is beginning to lessen: it might be too soon to see major fading of skin discoloration, but I have noticed the improvement, so I would recommend this product. If you&#x27;re looking for the &#x27;magic bullet&#x27;, this isn&#x27;t it. But it is a good addition to your current cosmetic regimen.</li>
    <li> I have skin that is too sensitive for regular use of OTC acne products - I have had mild to moderate acne since I was a teenager and I am now 43.  A couple years ago I read about glycolic acid and started using an OTC 10% solution which was amazing for my skin really causing it to clear up.  I discovered this 35% solution and have used it three times now and my skin is looking so much better.  The 10% solution is very gentle on the skin - the 35% is a little tougher but the results are faster.  This is really a must-have product for me.</li>
    <li> this product is spa grade. however, good to use for between visit to plastic surgeons for peels. i will order again but, i will get the stronger 50-70 because my face is used the medical grade. so order and make it part of your weekly facial.</li>
    <li> I never had much luck with the hydroxy acids that were too harsh for my skin (I&#x27;m 23), but this glycolic peel was amazing!  There was a tingling sensation, but it didn&#x27;t hurt, and 5 minutes later I rinsed it off and felt immediate results.  Even my husband noticed that my skin texture felt softer.  The next morning I woke up, and my skin was glowing... the acne scars had started to dissolve away and I literally had new skin.  The bottle says that I can use this twice a week, and with such great results from my first use, I will definitely continue.</li>
    <li> At one time II was able to afford high end beauty supply products- name brands Sephora, etc. as well as professional facials. I can no longer afford such expensive products/services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, I started reading extensive reviews, watching Utube for suggestions( i.e. this is where I learned that the Monistat Chafting gel has the same ingredients as Sephora&#x27;s primer (is actually better with less additives), etc., and started purchasing Amazon products that are extremely cost effective and in some cases the same product used when I had professional treatment, i.e. 35% Glycolic Acid, Emu oil, Argan Oil, Squalane, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results - if used properly - provide me the same results as professional treatment. Highly recommend these products but caution to read the reviews, especially on peel products such as the Glycolic Acid, so you do not damage skin and get exceptional results.</li>
    <li> I just could not believe with my eyes the wonders this Glycoloc Acid does to my face. I see a brighter skin color, a skin that is tight and a healthy glowing face. Don&#x27;t underestimate its hospital-like and non attractive packing. Its potency really lies inside the bottle.</li>
    <li> First off, Skin Laboratory is a wonderful company to work with....very quick shipment, packaged well, love the detailed instructions that come along. The results.....Whoa!  My nose has been bothering me a great deal....those darn blackheads.....my pores have been enlarging.......I&#x27;ve tried other products to fight these symptoms, Dr. Perricone and Dr. Denese....both have good products but This Peel is solving the problem and fast too.  Loving it!  I have dry skin so I ordered and just received Skin Lab&#x27;s lactic acid which is recommended for dryer skin.  But glad I started with this formula for a boost and the lactic will hopefully maintain.  Go for it ladies.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!  This is potent stuff if you haven&#x27;t used anything like it before.  Go slow.  I had a peel done in my dr&#x27;s office a few years back and knew what to expect.....by the way, that simple peel was $125.00.</li>
    <li> Great for exfoliation once or twice a week depending on your skin. Clear away flaky skin especially in cold weather. Followed by moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d product 2 days before expected which was a great beginning. I washed my hands, neck and face with mild cleanser and used witch hazel.I waited 1/2 hr and started on my hands and neck. No tingling on hands but neck wasnt even a one of 10 on pain level. I left it on full 10 minutes, I have had professional chemical peels before with good results.I like that it is a gel. Lots of control. Use lots of water to remove product. Hands looked soft, clean and a tiny bit younger. What was a surpise was my neck. I had red blotches on both sides of neck and they were GONE! Very pleased.I started on my face. I am a 56 yr old woman with all the normal issues. I have not excatly taken care of my skin. Sun damage, open pores white heads on nose, tiny scars on cheeks from acne. Pain was a 1 out of 10 and left it on 8 minutes. Skin softer, pores very clean and smaller. Sun spots were very red but I expected that. Used moisturize and waited. Skin was tighter for sure.  After about an hour, I noticed sun spots had calmed down and a few had faded. Not much mind you but I was happy. I will continue to use product and I do expect changes.  Be careful if you have never had chemical peels!! Start slow.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing. i noticed a difference after the first treatment.&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-boston</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, never use it since I try on one time .</li>
    <li> I use this peel all the time.  I have written other reviews about the product.  You have to know what you are doing before using a peel but if you are experienced, it definitely makes my skin look great and it definitely reduces the gunk in my pores.</li>
    <li> This solution is Weaker than I expected, based on the feedback from prior reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially when you apply the product you feel like you are being sticked with pins/needles, but this wears off in about a minute. After, application I can sleep with it on my face. I personally don&#x27;t find it to be effective unless I apply more than once per week, and longer than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom applies it to her face nightly, and cleanses her face in the morning. I saw the difference in her skin in two days.  I use much more chemicals on my face than her, so I apply the glycolic 2 - 3 per week, but seldom sleep with it on. (I apply it much or generously than my mom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this work best for a mild peel or a maintenance program. I need to remove some deep spots, before I can commence a maintenance program. Hence, I have since ordered MakeUp Artist Choice 70% Glycolic acid for my face, and 21% TCA solution for my elbows with the hope that these items will address my current concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however recommend that you keep in mind your skin type and sensitivity to citric acid when making your purchase, as well as applying these products to your skin. What works for me (&amp; my mom), may NOT work for you.</li>
    <li> Great peel for beginners. The gel keeps it from sliding all over your face and redistributing.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about doing chemical peels at home, as I have no experience with this kind of stuff. I decided to research thoroughly and this was the first chemical peel product that I have ever done. The 35% was a perfect beginners peel. I didn&#x27;t expect dramatic results and knew I had to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to leave the peel on for one minute the first time. It did sting a bit but nothing bad at all. My skin felt tighter.The 2nd time i kept it on for 3 minutes and gradually increased the length of time with each additional peel buy a minute or two. The instructions say to never leave it on longer than 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do the peels every 14 days and I just completed my 6th peel recently. I cleanse my face with Cetaphil face wash and then I apply Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner. Once dry, I then apply 3ml of the chemical peel to a 2x2 non-sterile gauze pad. I rinse the peel off with plain cool water from the sink or shower for a minute or two. No baking soda needed. Once face is dry I apply Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never did actually peel but I didn&#x27;t expect to because I knew this was a superficial chemical peel. It&#x27;s good for beginners or anyone who wants a quick peel with no down time. It fixed a couple of patches around my nose that would always be dry and require lotion. That alone was worth the little money I spent. It clears blackheads nicely. It makes your face smooth and glowing. I do notice a reduction in my old hyperpigmentation as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will do a couple of more peels of this before I step up to a 15% TCA peel. I have a lot more confidence knowing that I can safely do chemical peels at home without paying the exorbitant prices at spas and clinics. I highly recommend this chemical peel.</li>
    <li> I have used everything for acne in the last 20 years (accutane, retin-a, over the counter, mention it) but always break out. This product has helped to keep my outbreaks under control. I can get one of two pimples during my days but they&#x27;re small. Best compliment given after one time I used this was that I glowed. The person couldn&#x27;t figure out what was new but I knew it was my skin :)</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t really a peel but will leave your skin nice and clean and refreshed.  I have just left it on all day with no problem.</li>
    <li> This product helped to soften a scar on my forehead from age 3.  The scar from an small accident when I was a toddler showed up in my photos from kindergarten through my wedding pics (the photographer removed them for the final prints.).  After 2 or 3 months of once weekly use of this treatment, the scar has faded enough that I can only see it because I know where to look.  Also, the fine frown lines and those on my forehead have been greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the smoothness it brings to my face and neck.</li>
    <li> i have purchased this one for about 10 month plus, but i dont use it much as how the instruction recommended, but i saw the result after 3 times usage. My skintone becomes more and more even, whiter also. My mom and sis also told me that my skin looks much better than las year.</li>
    <li> I applied just as directed and left on for 3 minutes for my first time.  A noticeble difference.  I would highly recommend.  I also ended up doing my neck and decollage area as well.  This is a must have now for me item.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on this product, I wanted to try it and Boy, was I quite impressed. Will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> I am updating the last review I had written.I wrote about the fact I never received my product for which I was charged and that the sataff was not answering the emails I sent them regarding this matter. Finally a very helpful member of the Skin Laboratory staff called me and told me that somehow my order fell through the cracks during a period of a couple of hours that they were making some changes/updates to their website and I happened to place my order then at all times. He said my order would be shipped out today and most likely received within the next couple of days. He also said that they would be upgrading my order to a larger amount at no additional charge for my troubles. As far as them not answering my other emails regarding this, he said he was not sure what happened with that and would address that with other cust. service staff. I will update this again once I do receive my order. The price is right on this product and I have read other reviews giving five stars for product quality. I like to give a fair review we can all benefit from.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and my face looks the same. I have oily skin, acne and eczema. Do not waste your time and money on this product.</li>
    <li> I tried lower strength glycolic and also salicylic peel at first to be cautious, then this 35% gel and I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I try to use it once a week and only little visible peeling but skin looks smoother. I also used TCA and Jessner peel and it works well too and I use it once a month. These 2 gives me the same result I get from Obagi Nuderm but cheaper and I get faster result. It stings a little like sunburn so I use Strivectin on red areas which I usually get below the outer corner of my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have mild scarring on my face. The oldest scars are about 8 years old. I&#x27;m 26. Over the years I&#x27;ve used different exfoliating lotions, and through that process figured out that glycolic acid is the only acid my skin tolerates (lactic acid, for example, makes me break out horribly.) I strongly suggest that anyone interested in trying peels do this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing at-home peels for the past two and a half years. I started with Skin Laboratory Glycolic 25% 30mL, which I was thrilled with. It&#x27;s a gel, so it&#x27;s easy to apply evenly, and it tingles but does not burn. Immediately after the peel, my face looked and felt great! So fresh and clean. Over time some smaller scars disappeared, my husband raved about how bright my face looked, and it helped with the appearance of deeper scars. After I had used that bottle up, I decided to upgrade to 35%. I was hesitant about shelling out for the 100mL bottle of 35%, so I tried a different brand&#x27;s 35% glycolic peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT peel was not so great. XYZ brand&#x27;s peel was all liquidy, so even when dabbing it on with cotton balls, it was impossible to apply consistently. It helped somewhat with existing scars, but in other areas of my face it actually did more harm than good. It was too harsh and was extremely uncomfortable to use. For days afterward my face would look dingy and dirty as the top layer of skin peeled off. While this is to be expected on some level with a peel, I&#x27;ve found that Skin Laboratory&#x27;s gel peel does not cause this to the same degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got fed up with XYZ brand peel and decided to go back to Skin Laboratory. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Just did the first peel with it and it&#x27;s just as pleasing as the 25%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried the XYZ brand liquid peel on my arms, which helped with dark spots from when I was younger (I used to spend lots of time outside, getting scraped up and being in the sun for hours at at time).  So I would say, use the liquid peels on your body, but stick with Skin Laboratory&#x27;s gel peels for your face.tick with Skin Laboratory&#x27;s gel peels for your face.</li>
    <li> this helped out a lot! i was nervous that it would make me break out more, but it actually cleared up my skin and the peeling wasnt visible. worth the money and little bit of stinging! a little goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> Not for sensitive skin.  This is the perfect exfoliator.  No scrubbing that micro-scratches the skin and no tugging or pulling the skin with your hands in order to cleanse.  Absolutely the best way to brighten my very sluggish, oily skin.  Have used it for over ten years.</li>
    <li> I love this peel for wrinkles (under the eyes) and brown spots.  After using once, my skin has a glow.  I have been using this product for nearly 3 years and have not been disappointed yet.  Will continue to buy as long as it is available.  Really makes a difference in my skin care and I don&#x27;t have to use so many creams, salves, etc.  This product and a good moisturizer is all one really needs (and saves $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$).</li>
    <li> i saw this product today and am yet to try it but i want to know if it really works on stretch marks?i gave it 3 stars because am yet to try.</li>
    <li> didnt get to use the whole bottle</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my son who has mild acne and for my fine facial lines. I applied this product correctly for 8 months and did not notice any results. It burned, but standing in front of the air vent helped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 56 year old man that went to a local spa and paid $150 for this treatment that is basically glycolic acid with a few other little foo foo additives. So I decided to buy the main ingredient and each time I&#x27;ve used this product it does reduce the minor wrinkles &amp; lines. It burns a little initially and I leave it on for 5-8 minutes and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin if I rinse well with water. I use it once/week but it recommends once/3 weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for renewing your skin. I used it once  per month to improve skin tone and natural collagen. It also improves wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product several months ago.I used it 2x per week and put some in my night creme like Olay has.I am so impressed with the results! I have had 3 friends purchse this as a result!Many people said what are you using on your face it looks amazing. Even a compliment from my Mother who never gives compliments. She said, omg your skin looks great you look younger what sre you using? She too has since purchased!My skin has a glow as it did in my 20&#x27;s, I am 43. I too cannot believe the difference. My skin does look younger and glowing. Did not do anything for the one liver spot on the side of my face. I am going to now try the 50%. This product is so worth the money, cheap when comparedto what some will spend without such results! I am now a lifer with these peels! No down time as there is no notable peeling. I have looked at other sellers who give several samples of their produts wih purchse of the peel. That would be great too because you would also be marketing other produts that go hand in hand to make the peel more effective as the other companies are doing! Just a suggestion! Cant wait to order the 50%. I am told to not do peels in the summer as it will cause age spots per my doctor.I used rubbing alchol to prep my skin before peel. REMEMBER, use at least a 50 sun block after.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have been using it once a week for a year with always perfect results: tightens and brightens skin in 5 minutes, improves skin color and oil secretion, removes back and white heads, excellent before deep skin cleaning to remove oils since it opens the pores right after rinse and tightens pores afterwords. Do not keep more that 5 minutes due to high risk of skin burn, had it ones. Use with ultrasonic skin brush to rinse off.</li>
    <li> It is taking time but the product is working. I feel it will take at least 6 weeks. Sun damage is a big deal.</li>
    <li> A gentle peel. No flaking or redness.  After a few uses skin is very soft and flaws are minimized. Follow directions, also buy a neutralizer.</li>
    <li> it always breaks the skin as soon as its applied, plus it gives me alot of tiny bumps all over my face. I love the other peels that skin laboratory has. Their quality is by far better than any other peels out there. Obssesion n the others are waterd down. I will continue to order peels from them because the make my skin look amazing. This peel just wasnt for me im in my early 20s so i have no wrinkles n i dont need collagen so i used the wrong peel thats it! But i must say it was on time...</li>
    <li> Good gentle microexfoliator.  It won&#x27;t peel.  Semi-weekly use keeps dead cells off which can help soften the appearance of fine lines and age and sun spots.  Use a good alcohol Fred moisturizer AND sunscreen or you&#x27;ll just damage your skin more.</li>
    <li> Worked well for me. Faded my age spots and evened the tone of my face and neck. I left it on at first for a couple of minutes and increased the time gradually and now I leave it on for 8 minutes. Works great. I use baking powder to neutralize before washing off and that works fine.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I do IPL for basic tone correction, this peel prevents discoloration between IPL treatments (usually once per year), improves tone, reduces pore size, and improves wrinkles. It&#x27;s subtle, and gives me a great glow! I do follow directions strictly, only keeping on for a minute and then rinsing for three...</li>
    <li> I started out with Lactic 50%, then Lactic 70%, which helped fade my melasma significantly, then I moved on to this one. I have loved the results of these peels.  I went with the glycolic 35% because I heard it was harsher than the lactic and didn&#x27;t want to plunge in but rather build up some tolerance.  It did sting more than the lactic but nothing ridiculous.  My skin did look smoother and somewhat clearer and also helped my melasma a little but it does not have the moisturizing qualities of the lactic. From my understanding, they work on different levels of the skin, the glycolic being able to work at a deeper level than the lactic so now I alternate one week of lactic, one of glycolic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this peel, I started with a one minute application. I had mild tingling but nothing extreme.  I added 1 min each time until I was doing 4 minutes. I continue to notice subtle improvements on my face as I continue my applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled with stubborn, resistant hyper-pigmentation (melasma) around my eyes for years. I tried countless products that seemed to work for others but did not work for me. Only photofacials had been able to remove it but it returned with the slightest bit of sun (hyper-active melanocytes) so photofacials were just too expensive for a temporary solution. These peels, week by week, (and a gradual increase in strength, along with a combination of other products I have listed on my profile), slowly faded them. As I moved on to stronger peels, its now 95% gone. It will still occasionally come back when I have a run in with the sun but it fades away again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company has a lot of information on their website and are very responsive so I continue to buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES ON PEELS:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t do it more often than they recommend.  They recommend you do it every so often for a reason. Your skin has to have time to heal and develop new skin before you strip it away again.&lt;br /&gt;-You HAVE to wear sunblock. Your skin is more exposed and vulnerable to damage from sun. Protect it. If you don&#x27;t you are canceling out or even reversing your progress. I like this one, [[ASIN:B004ZF75LS Ole Henriksen Protect the Truth Sunscreen SPF 50+-1.7 oz]].  Its not the best moisturizer but as a sunblock, its great.  Its my favorite because its hard to find high spf that doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze, smell funky or make your eyes tear up.&lt;br /&gt;-When you are doing your peels, make sure you start with a clean DRY face, water will dilute the acid in your peel. I am wondering if thats why some people did not see any results.  I wash my face, swipe it with alcohol on a cotton ball to remove any leftover oils and to help dry it. Wait 10-15 minutes, then apply the peel.&lt;br /&gt;-Use a fan brush like this one[[ASIN:B004NMF63W Taklon Fan Mask Brush Acid Applicator for Glycolic Lactic TCA Skin Peel / Masques (Small)]]. Mine has lasted over a year. You can use cotton balls/squares but I think they absorb product so you will waste some and get less peels out of your bottle.&lt;br /&gt;-Watch your face when the peel is on.  The recommended time is a guideline, everyones skin is different and reacts differently. Thats why they recommend you start slow.  Some are ok 1 min the first time, others the full 4 min.  Once your skin starts looking pinkish, its time to remove. If it gets red, you&#x27;ve gone too long.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure you wash off ALL of the acid. Wash, rewash, wash again.  I like to shower right after to make sure its all gone.  Any leftover acid will continue to work its way into your skin. I like to use a post peel neutralizer as an extra precaution. MD Formulations had a post peel neutralizer that was AWESOME but they don&#x27;t sell it individually. I am trying this one [[ASIN:B000VEN3RW Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]]. It works but I am still trying to find one more like the MD formulations one.  You pour onto cotton ball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water. You can also mix your own neutralizer using baking soda and water.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize after. This one has been my favorite to use after, [[ASIN:B00700H128 Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]]. I also use it as a night cream. Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave a residue.to cotton ball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water.

    <li> This stuff sucks. It didn&#x27;t help me with anything. It caused my skin to be very oily and break out.</li>
    <li> MY SECOND BOTTLE. MY FACE LOOKS AMAZING.  RECCOMEND IT FACE GLOWS FINE LINES DECREASED. AMAZING PRODUCT BUY IT MUST HAVE</li>
    <li> This product works very well but after having used it for several months, my next purchase will be a stronger strength.</li>
    <li> 35% Glycolic acis is a good starting place for at home peels. Excellent Customer service and a great product! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> it does everything it said it will do.it will be a month before you see any real results but it&#x27;s definatly worth it</li>
    <li> Skin feel very soft after using.  My skin loves the acid peels so I leave it on much longer than the recommended 8 minutes and have never been burned.</li>
    <li> This peel is great! I use it once every two weeks as maintenance for breakouts. My skin is soooo much better. I usually switch back and forth between the glycolic and salicylic acid. MAN I cannot say/ express how these peels have helped exfoliate my skin. My face was so congested and I was breakingout around my chin and neck area. I visited the dermatologist so many times and was on antibiotics and spironolactone 150 mg. I was tired of taking pills that didn&#x27;t seem to work. I was embarrassed of my face and the new breakouts everyday. My face started looking soooooo much better 2 weeks after starting the peels. First I stated using the salicylic acid 20% two times and week so like 3-4 days in between and I would leave it on for about 1 and half minute the first time because I was scared of doing the peel myself. Next time I ttried it for 2 minutes.. Then i built tolerance to 6 minutes. I don&#x27;t use it more than that because I don&#x27;t want to dry my face. After about using half of the bottle of salicylic acid I introduced my face to glycolic acid and used it just how I used the salicylic acid. I built my tolerance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I prepped my skin:&lt;br /&gt;Washed my face with a mild face wash either cetaphil or aveeno. Then set up all of the things I was going to use for the peel.&lt;br /&gt;1. Isopropyl alcohol&lt;br /&gt;2. Cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;3. Little spice bowl to pour the peel in&lt;br /&gt;4. Fan brush from Michael&#x27;s like $2-3&lt;br /&gt;5. A little plastic Tupperware filled with water and baking soda to neutralize the acid when I want to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;6. A fan or magazine to fan myself when the acid is on my face&lt;br /&gt;7. A thick moisturizer like CeraVe to apply after.&lt;br /&gt;After you&#x27;ve washed your face, use the cotton pad and alcohol to wipe and dirt or grease still left on your face. Then start a timer then apply the acid with the fan brush. I started on my forehead then moved down. You will notice once you apply the acid that your bumps/ pimples will come to a head almost instantly.. It&#x27;s pretty cool! Because you see the acid working! Then I washed my face with the water and baking soda which stings a lot but keep rinsin your face then switch to faucet water for 2 minutes till you feel it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore. Then apply moisturizer. You&#x27;ll start seeing the difference even after the first peel. It&#x27;s really effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I see people with bad acne I just want to take them home with me and do a peel on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love doing peels at home. I will not spend $80-120 on peels ever again!nstantly.. It&#x27;s pretty cool! Because you see the acid working!
