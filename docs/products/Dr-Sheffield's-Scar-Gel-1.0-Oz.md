### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy and impressed.</li>
      <li>Dollar store best price on this if u can find it!</li>
      <li>Applying it 2 tmx per day is ideal (for me).</li>
      <li>But I was impressed that this gel took the bright redness out of my scar after just two days.</li>
      <li>Dr. Sheffield&#x27;s Scar Gel works beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Just fantastic !!!</li>
      <li>The ingredients seem good, but I don&#x27;t have a history with it</li>
      <li>It can be bought at the dollar tree but because they run out so quickly your best bet is just ordering it on amazon for 23 cents unless price changes.</li>
      <li>This is very good product it works and made my skin very smooth and took away  most of my blemishes</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>Amazing.  </li>
      <li>I saw this at the dollar store and bought it thinking it might come in handy some time.  </li>
      <li>You can really find some great things and not so great things at dollar stores.  </li>
      <li>and it is very cheap</li>
      <li>Since it blows Maderma outta the water price-wise, am able to use it on more areas.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I went and bought 5 more tubes of Dr.</li>
      <li>This stuff is more like water than a gel, and after it dries on my neck it starts to get flaky and peel off.  </li>
      <li>but before it worked ok.</li>
      <li>This worked better for me instead of a bunch of medicines that cost more and never work.</li>
      <li>You will have better control using this product if you put it in a pump bottle.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>However for some bizarre reason there are perfumes added to this Gel, making it reek.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
      <li>so far so good</li>
      <li>good so far.....</li>
      <li>helps, but real a real lot!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>it goes on fine but do not see that much of an improvement in the scar</li>
      <li>It is great for the price, but it is a little runny.</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s thinner, but still very much worth it!&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a week and my scars look better every day; I&#x27;m going to keep using this, since the scars will take time to fade completely.</li>
      <li>DEFINITELY worth the buy.</li>
      <li>I decided to give it another go a month later when I had more free time at home.</li>
      <li>but after seeing the results in 24 hours it is so worth the flaking.</li>
      <li>Helped the healing almost immediately, saw results right away.  </li>
      <li>One day I left it on all day by accident (tube doesn&#x27;t really have a time limit, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest all day NOW, lol), and it started to heat up a little, kind of like what Olay does with their microdermabrasion stuff.</li>
      <li>Well, it has kind of worked, actually (don&#x27;t judge me, lol), and the only reason I know that is because I accidentally left it on all day that day.</li>
      <li>My scars from surgery are softening and healing very fast.  </li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice anything, so I put it away for a while.</li>
      <li>Just need to be willing to gamble $1.</li>
      <li>Good price, but did not use it long enough to judge how well it works.</li>
      <li>- just wanted peeps to know how much cheaper they can buy it.  </li>
      <li>I used the whole tube &amp; my scar is still just as visible as it was before.</li>
      <li>My scars have started to turn pink instead of purple :-)</li>
      <li>Product as described, fast delivery</li>
      <li>travel sized pump bottle and have it ready to squeeze the gel into it, because once you uncap it and peel off the foil, it flows out of the tube really, really fast.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>Cheap and works (slowly, but surely).</li>
      <li>i used it multiple times a day first month then kinda tapered off but worth it.</li>
      <li>It really faded my scars so far!!</li>
      <li>This product is only 88 cents in WalMart, but it&#x27;s still not a bad deal here.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure if it is exactly as effective as the more expensive gels -- but it seems to be a good value for the low price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on old scars and my sister has tried in on some pregnancy stretch marks and it works very well.  </li>
      <li>You have to use it at least twice a day for it to be effective.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s helping on a scar that&#x27;s years old!</li>
      <li>It is comparable to Mederma (same ingredients) but costs about one tenth as much.  </li>
      <li>It was much like a water than a cream tho, so when you squeeze some out, be careful because it comes out pretty  quickly, and you don&#x27;t want to waste any.</li>
      <li>It reduces fresh scarring extremely well, lowers the scars and softens them as well as improving colour.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say if it&#x27;s overused, the skin could really start to dry up and get raw, which would only cause more scars.</li>
      <li>when I thought of it over the next couple weeks and low and behold, yesterday was the first day I could go outside without needing something to cover it up.  </li>
      <li>I have not used it consistently because of the messy nature of the stuff, so I can&#x27;t say if it works or not.</li>
      <li>Gross, mostly liquid, stinks to high heaven.</li>
      <li>Face is a little itchy after doing too much, I believe...</li>
      <li>Think Maderma is the better quality product but who can afford it for large areas (hv bad scarring on arms, some on legs).&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe something that cost so little could have such an impact; the scar is in a very noticeable place</li>

<li> Far cheaper than other scar gels</li>
<li> It will last a long time.</li>
<li> and I saw minor fading in just a couple of days.</li>
<li> It makes the skin dry a bit, but not a problem for me.</li>
<li> been using it for a few months, will check back in later.  </li>
<li> Would suggest buying a few if you&#x27;re going to get serious about using it, tube goes quickly because it says to use it 3 times a day.</li>
<li> The scar was dark purple, dry, and raised, now it&#x27;s starting to flatten out and turn</li>
<li> The discoloring from the subsequent black eye (from the eyelid cut) has also lightened.  </li>
<li> scar is def softer than i would&#x27;ve expected</li>
<li> The scar of my face is now a small white line and when I run my finger over it there are no gnarled spots.  </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it for big scars just small ones.</li>
<li> Try it out - not much to lose!</li>
<li> I have a thick scar that is almost 4 years old and this has, unbelievably, flattened it and made the edges much less noticeable.</li>
<li> I see slight improvement.</li>
<li> This has happened in the past with other items I have purchased at dollar stores.</li>
<li> Its a little runny.</li>
<li> I started putting it on a lot throughout the last few weeks, and my acne scars are slowly getting lighter, yay!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> However, I would not recommend leaving it on all day, and doing it everyday.</li>
<li> i havent broken out from it yet and its only been a couple of days to tell but</li>
<li> Not nearly effective as the other products I&#x27;ve used (Mederma and Walgreens brand).</li>
<li> Bought it at Dollar Tree, because I was desperate to clear up acne scars.</li>
<li> : get a small, 2 oz.</li>
<li> It was sitting on my desk and tried a small amount on a dark spot I&#x27;d been unable to get rid of with products that advertise the ability to remove dark spots.  </li>
<li> now it&#x27;s hard to see.  </li>
<li> Not good for people who have allergies.  </li>
<li> After several months of using this product I found no improvement in the appearance of my scars :(</li>
<li> ill say that its taking the redness away from my scars.</li>
<li> Stupid me was like, &amp;</li>
<li> My scars were bad!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff works!  It is great for the price, but it is a little runny.</li>
    <li> This product is only 88 cents in WalMart, but it&#x27;s still not a bad deal here.  I got busted in the face during a horse accident and ended up with a 4 inch gash in my forehead.  I have a skin condition that creates massive scar tissue buildup after surgeries or injuries or anything where my skin has to heal (plastic surgery will never be an option for me).  My mom told me about this stuff about a month after the accident (she had a rifle scope cut her eye open).  I absolutely love this stuff.  The scar of my face is now a small white line and when I run my finger over it there are no gnarled spots.  I&#x27;ve been using it on old scars and my sister has tried in on some pregnancy stretch marks and it works very well.  I didn&#x27;t use it 3 times a day like the instructions said, I just used it once a day after I&#x27;d washed my face. I noticed a difference after about a month of use.</li>
    <li> Used a couple times a day, saw improvement in about a week or so. The scars from acne on my face were looking lighter and this also helped my skin feel softer, but that wasn&#x27;t the reason I bought it. Would suggest buying a few if you&#x27;re going to get serious about using it, tube goes quickly because it says to use it 3 times a day. It was much like a water than a cream tho, so when you squeeze some out, be careful because it comes out pretty  quickly, and you don&#x27;t want to waste any. It can be bought at the dollar tree but because they run out so quickly your best bet is just ordering it on amazon for 23 cents unless price changes. You should see results, not breakouts. Would recommend this product to anyone with over the counter medicines. This worked better for me instead of a bunch of medicines that cost more and never work. That&#x27;s it. Go get this because its a Good-Buy.... and now Good-bye!</li>
    <li> I have a thick scar that is almost 4 years old and this has, unbelievably, flattened it and made the edges much less noticeable. I can&#x27;t believe something that cost so little could have such an impact; the scar is in a very noticeable place and I&#x27;m self-conscious about it. My dermatologist said this would only work for 6 months after the accident (and I wish I&#x27;d thought of it then) but it&#x27;s helping on a scar that&#x27;s years old!</li>
    <li> I have bought the Scar Gel to use on my hypertrophic scar. I will get back in touch if it realy works.</li>
    <li> After several months of using this product I found no improvement in the appearance of my scars :( I would not recommend this product to anyone. The scars I have range in age from 1-3 years so that could be why this didn&#x27;t work. The scars I tried to use this on was scars from surgery on my shoulder, and scars on my legs and arms from skin biopsies. All remained the same in appearance,</li>
    <li> so far so good i havent broken out from it yet and its only been a couple of days to tell but ill say that its taking the redness away from my scars. so fingers crossed it works or i will return</li>
    <li> I have never tried Mecderma because of the price, but I saw this product at the dollar store. It states on box compare to Mecderma, so I thought what the heck!  I saw a big difference just after applying twice within 24 hours.  It does kinda of flake but after seeing the results in 24 hours it is so worth the flaking. Also in 2 weeks scar was practically gone.  I love this stuff. I went and bought 5 more tubes of Dr.Sheffields Scar Gel just in case they discontinued carrying it.  This has happened in the past with other items I have purchased at dollar stores. You can really find some great things and not so great things at dollar stores.  This is defintely a keeper.  Just need to be willing to gamble $1.</li>
    <li> My scars have started to turn pink instead of purple :-)</li>
    <li> Dr. Sheffield&#x27;s Scar Gel works beautifully.  It is comparable to Mederma (same ingredients) but costs about one tenth as much.  My scars from surgery are softening and healing very fast.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> bought it for my son ...good so far..... using as required...looking to see results.. giving it some time to work.</li>
    <li> Does not help with scars at all. I used the whole tube &amp; my scar is still just as visible as it was before. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> seems to be working however it causes skin to flake and dryness. i guess that is just one downside to getting rid of acne scars.</li>
    <li> Good price, but did not use it long enough to judge how well it works. I have decided on a cream scar product instead.</li>
    <li> I was tempted to buy Mederma but the price made me reconsider. I had ankle surgery two months ago and have some very big scars. I started using Dr. Sheffield&#x27;s scar gel and I saw minor fading in just a couple of days. It&#x27;s been a week and my scars look better every day; I&#x27;m going to keep using this, since the scars will take time to fade completely. But I was impressed that this gel took the bright redness out of my scar after just two days. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Cheap and works (slowly, but surely). It makes the skin dry a bit, but not a problem for me. Try it out - not much to lose!</li>
    <li> It reduces fresh scarring extremely well, lowers the scars and softens them as well as improving colour. However for some bizarre reason there are perfumes added to this Gel, making it reek.  Not good for people who have allergies.  If only it wasn&#x27;t for the perfumes it would be a wonder product.</li>
    <li> ...YOU GUESSED IT...1.00!! The ingredients seem good, but I don&#x27;t have a history with it - just wanted peeps to know how much cheaper they can buy it.  I&#x27;m using it on my surgical scar, and I&#x27;ll get back on Amazon and let you know how it&#x27;s progressing.</li>
    <li> ...I will definitely recommend. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I see slight improvement. Its a little runny. i used it multiple times a day first month then kinda tapered off but worth it. You get a lot!!! It will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I recently began using this scar gel on an eyelid cut that left a big bump and scar. After about 2-3 weeks the scar is virtually gone!  Amazing.  The discoloring from the subsequent black eye (from the eyelid cut) has also lightened.  Just fantastic !!! I&#x27;m going to try it on another scar too. I&#x27;m getting a case of this stuff!  Great product.  ~Denise, NYC</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Bought it at Dollar Tree, because I was desperate to clear up acne scars. At first I didn&#x27;t notice anything, so I put it away for a while. I decided to give it another go a month later when I had more free time at home. One day I left it on all day by accident (tube doesn&#x27;t really have a time limit, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest all day NOW, lol), and it started to heat up a little, kind of like what Olay does with their microdermabrasion stuff. Stupid me was like, &amp;#34;well, maybe it&#x27;s supposed to burn! Like when i tried the baking soda/lemon thing!&amp;#34;. Well, it has kind of worked, actually (don&#x27;t judge me, lol), and the only reason I know that is because I accidentally left it on all day that day. I started putting it on a lot throughout the last few weeks, and my acne scars are slowly getting lighter, yay! However, I would not recommend leaving it on all day, and doing it everyday. Face is a little itchy after doing too much, I believe... but my scars are definitely fading. I&#x27;d say if it&#x27;s overused, the skin could really start to dry up and get raw, which would only cause more scars.</li>
    <li> I have used this in a while but before it worked ok.</li>
    <li> This stuff is more like water than a gel, and after it dries on my neck it starts to get flaky and peel off.  I have not used it consistently because of the messy nature of the stuff, so I can&#x27;t say if it works or not.</li>
    <li> I saw this at the dollar store and bought it thinking it might come in handy some time.  It was sitting on my desk and tried a small amount on a dark spot I&#x27;d been unable to get rid of with products that advertise the ability to remove dark spots.  What the heck!  I put some on the spot when I thought of it over the next couple weeks and low and behold, yesterday was the first day I could go outside without needing something to cover it up.  It&#x27;s so light now it&#x27;s hard to see.  It&#x27;s a buck, try it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Since it blows Maderma outta the water price-wise, am able to use it on more areas. Yes it&#x27;s thinner, but still very much worth it!&lt;br /&gt;  Think Maderma is the better quality product but who can afford it for large areas (hv bad scarring on arms, some on legs).&lt;br /&gt;  Applying it 2 tmx per day is ideal (for me). If u work it in the skin well minimizes flaking (Maderma does that as well/gell). If flaking bothers you, use only at bedtime, rinse off in morning.&lt;br /&gt;  Dollar store best price on this if u can find it!</li>
    <li> Not nearly effective as the other products I&#x27;ve used (Mederma and Walgreens brand).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week on my acne scars and it has WORKED WONDERS. It really faded my scars so far!! I&#x27;m very happy and impressed. DEFINITELY worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Item seems to work well and you cant beat the price. I am not sure if it is exactly as effective as the more expensive gels -- but it seems to be a good value for the low price.</li>
    <li> I sliced my leg shaving and this gel help the healing process. You have to use it at least twice a day for it to be effective. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for big scars just small ones.</li>
    <li> been using it for a few months, will check back in later.  Helped the healing almost immediately, saw results right away.  scar is def softer than i would&#x27;ve expected</li>
    <li> helps, but real a real lot! My scars were bad!</li>
    <li> I never used Mederma so I don&#x27;t know how this compares, however, I bought this to use on a keloid scar on the back of my heel. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and I can see it has made an ENORMOUS difference. The scar was dark purple, dry, and raised, now it&#x27;s starting to flatten out and turn pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I suggest: get a small, 2 oz. travel sized pump bottle and have it ready to squeeze the gel into it, because once you uncap it and peel off the foil, it flows out of the tube really, really fast. You will have better control using this product if you put it in a pump bottle.</li>
    <li> Gross, mostly liquid, stinks to high heaven. Far cheaper than other scar gels but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Product as described, fast delivery</li>
    <li> it goes on fine but do not see that much of an improvement in the scar</li>
    <li> This is very good product it works and made my skin very smooth and took away  most of my blemishes and it is very cheap I strongly recommend this product.</li>
</ol>
