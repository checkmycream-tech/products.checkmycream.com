    <li> Thick Shampoo which seems to work well.  We will buy again and recomend this shampoo to family.  Smaller bottle,  but since it is thick one only needs a little.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jhirmack shampoo for years and it is now hard to find in the stores. I have never &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; my grey hair which started when I was 25 and I&#x27;m now 90!  You can imagine my delight in finding a grey-hair shampoo that kept away the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t make me look like a blue-haired&amp;#34; old lady.  Delighted to find it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> good good &amp; very good</li>
    <li> Super inexpensive alternative to salon-grade blonde shampoos your hairdresser will trick you into buying. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bleached my hair, so I&#x27;m not positive about the brassiness prevention, but I feel like it works as well as anything else of its kind.</li>
    <li> Using this for decades.</li>
    <li> Cant fine it in the stores anymore found it online at a better price!</li>
    <li> My white hair tends to get yellowish and this product takes the yellow away.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist recommended it. Love it.</li>
    <li> have grey hair and this product keeps my hair from turning yellow without leaving a blue cast as some other shampoos have.</li>
    <li> I love how this shampoo makes my silver hair shine.  Now that people are coloring their hair this color intentionally, I get lots of positive remarks about my hair color and its all natural.</li>
    <li> I have silver hair.  I have used Jhirmack Silver Plus Shampoo for at least 30 years.  It has kept my hair a shining silver for all these years.  I have many comments about my hair color and I am so glad I can still buy the shampoo.  I can&#x27;t find it in the city where I live so it means a great deal to me that I can still get my shampoo.  Thanks very much.</li>
    <li> If you want your gray hair to be shiny ann bright, not dingy, yellowed, or blue, this is the shampoo you&#x27;ve been trying to find!</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo to keep my hair color staying true and not turning brassy. (3 color weave). Had trouble finding this in the stores so purchased the 3 pack which turns out to be more convenient and cheaper. Would highly recommend for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Has anyone ever accidentally gotten this into their eyes?  OMG.  It&#x27;s horrific.  The stinging pain was awful and took hours to get it calmed down.  I actually filed a complaint with Jhirmack</li>
    <li> Great to find as stores in my area do not appear to carry this item.</li>
    <li> Been using this shampoo and conditioner for about 10 years.  My old gray hair looks great!</li>
    <li> My wife used this product for many, many years. She passed away last year and I was in need of some shampoo; her&#x27;s was in the cabinet so I tried it. It is fantastic and if I had known how good it was I&#x27;d have used it sooner. However, the only place I could find it was on Amazon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> You find a product you love and then. . . poof . . . it is gone.  This is a super shampoo for gray as it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with that dreaded &amp;#34;granny blue&amp;#34; tint.  Ordered 6 bottles - should have ordered more!</li>
    <li> Perfect shampoo if you have gray or graying hair.  Keeps it from being yellow or brassy.  I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> So happy to find on Amazon. It was no longer available from my usual source. Love this shampoo and have used it for years. I have silver/white hair and this does the trick for taking out and preventing yellowing.</li>
    <li> its what i always use.</li>
    <li> My husband has been white haired since he was a very young man.  This keeps his hair and beard a wonderful color.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser RAVES about the color and condition of my hair. I tell her it&#x27;s my Jhirmack shampoo that keeps the gray so bright and crisp without any yellow.  I let my gray show through about 3 years ago and I&#x27;ve never been sorry since I&#x27;ve used this shampoo since the beginning (after 1 bottle of their salon brand at $16 a bottle).</li>
