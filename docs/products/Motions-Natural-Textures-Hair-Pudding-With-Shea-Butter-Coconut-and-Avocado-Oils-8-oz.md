      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with how managable her hair is.</li>
      <li>I use Wen (another great product)</li>

      <li>and it comes out great each morning that I use this.  </li>

      <li>Nice scent.</li>
      <li>I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s very curly \\&quot;Jewfro\\&quot; hair, and it worked great!  </li>
      <li>using my hair dryer&#x27;s diffuser kept the curls nice without frizz or the crispness</li>
      <li>I think it makes me look glamorous but that could be in my own mind.</li>
      <li>This is probably the best wash-n-go product I&#x27;ve used in a while with such good results.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have found for my daughters&#x27; naturally curly hair!  </li>
      <li>my curls are perfect coils and my hair is so soft...</li>
      <li>I also use it as kind of a refresher for wash and go type styles when i dont wanna do more than a water spritzer and use this to make my hair look like i tried to do it.</li>
      <li>that might be a nice edition. :)</li>
      <li>but if you dont mind that then this may be a good cheaper fit for you.</li>
      <li>It is one of thise styling products that even your hair stylist will ask you about because of the soft feel and wonderful scent.  </li>
      <li>Motions Hydrate My Curls Pudding is light, lightly fragranced and gives my curls life and they look great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with my results.</li>
      <li>the oil is very light.</li>
      <li>Since I have been wearing  my hair curly with a very light textualizer I have been on the search for products that would define my curls as well as condition my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is also really nice on this, and it is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Product is salon strenght type product, it has good texture that is easy to work with and the product fragrance is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>The smell, as with the \\&quot;crème\\&quot;, is pleasant: not too sweet, not too strong if you are using just a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is always more frizzy when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>I use this product the most and also on my scalp my hair stays flowy.</li>
      <li>I might love a product, while someone else hates it.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly for doing twists.</li>
      <li>love this product and the container that it comes in</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this....</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I tend to color quite often to cover my increasingly prominent gray hair.  </li>
      <li>has been doing a phenomenal job with my hair.</li>
      <li>and I love my hair.  </li>
      <li>so I just dab one finger in the top and that is all I use for my hair</li>
      <li>so many products...</li>
      <li>My wife applied it and was pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>My hair is in love.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m able to style it easier after the application of this product.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t scientifically say that my hair is more moisturized</li>
      <li>i really do love it...</li>
      <li>It may work better for others.  </li>
      <li>The product was received timely and I love the smell and feel of it.</li>
      <li>i had seen a review for this product online and was very excited to try it</li>
      <li>&quot; hair cut on the sides and back of my hair and this is excellent to keep your hair from becoming frizzy but</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite moisturizer, but it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
      <li>For her, it worked best on dry hair.</li>
      <li>At first hus hair looked  better but not any more!</li>
      <li>but it left my hair looking incredibly greasy-</li>
      <li>When I used it, wet hair was best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s this product I used - one time a long-lost friend had seen me and after giving me a hug noted that my hair smelt nice.</li>
      <li>My 4b/c hair has a full blown relationship with this product!</li>
      <li>I think I originally gave this product a not so cute review, but as my hair has gotten healthier, I revisited it because</li>
      <li>We found the product washes out fairly easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to spread, it&#x27;s not as greasy as products with stuff like petrolium jelly in them.</li>
      <li>Naturally You, Hydrate My Curls Pudding as a good product that gave her curls more definition and softened her hair.  </li>
      <li>apparently what smell it DOES have is pleasant. :)</li>
      <li>though our daughter has incredibly curly hair naturally, there are times when the curls simply fall apart or just do not look good anymore</li>
      <li>Also I put a dab of this in one of my oil spritzers for the smell and it worked out fine</li>
      <li>As far as the scent goes, I would have to say it was pleasant and light.</li>
      <li>Not as creamy as I anticipated, but, its light, oily without being greasy..</li>
      <li>this and found this to be very helpful to keep my curls - shiny and nice</li>
      <li>This product fit the bill.</li>
      <li>it came out fabulous....</li>
      <li>I really enjoy, too, how light it is.</li>
      <li>this product was light for my hair .</li>
      <li>But this product has all the good things of a natural oil without making it too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
      <li>I have not used it yet, but I know the manufacturer and have used other products from them, so I am sure that this one will be great.  </li>
      <li>For something that advertised itself as providing a \\&quot;significant improvement,\\&quot; I was not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love this at first</li>
      <li>With this cream, I can make sure hair stays put and it does not get overworked by the hot, curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I also liked the scent a lot, it is a perfumey rather than natural scent</li>
      <li>really know what more to say.</li>
      <li>Many of them do a good initial job, but the next day you have to really work with your hair to try and get it looking good again.</li>
      <li>I really like as well--it does a great job in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Must keep container airtight or composition changes quickly.</li>
      <li>I am always on the hunt for super conditioners</li>
      <li>I love sampling new products (I&#x27;m a hair care and makeup junkie), and was eager to try this out.  </li>
      <li>So, it&#x27;s with a bit of skepticism I try new hair products any more.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased and instantly developed a little crush, hoping this would be my next great hair love.  </li>
      <li>For example, I would not use this product on our daughter who has fine straight blondis hair.</li>
      <li>Though it gives light definition to my twist out, its very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s hair (she&#x27;s half African American), and this works great for her hair. It&#x27;s easy to spread, it&#x27;s not as greasy as products with stuff like petrolium jelly in them. it softens her hair great!!!! I also bought the conditioner (that you rinse off after shampooing) and I&#x27;m really happy with how managable her hair is. Her hair is thin, but still has the &amp;#34;fro&amp;#34; going on...</li>
    <li> I picked this up at a local store and I used it for a couple of weeks and I don&#x27;t see nothing it did it felt like i wasted my money. Only thing it did was provide shine to my hair and no moisture so don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff. Look for something natural with some oils in it like I am.</li>
    <li> When I used to straighten my hair I used Motions products and loved them.  Since I have been wearing  my hair curly with a very light textualizer I have been on the search for products that would define my curls as well as condition my hair.  I was elated when I found that Motions had a line for curly hair.  I thought the \\&quot;pudding\\&quot; in the title was copied from Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly pudding.  When I tried this --ugh.  While my hair was wet  it elongated and defined each curl but once my hair dried it was a frizzy greasy mess.  Can&#x27;t think of a grade of hair that would react well to this. Motions need to go back to the drawing board for this one.</li>
    <li> I think I originally gave this product a not so cute review, but as my hair has gotten healthier, I revisited it because.......well I had paid for it and it was in my closet. So, second time around and I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with my results. You definitely need a light hand with, but I like it.</li>
    <li> about this product is that there is no chemically smell. but it left my hair looking incredibly greasy- both looking and feeling! it really had that i hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a few days shine. i had seen a review for this product online and was very excited to try it but i really regret the purchase. i did like the MOTIONS NATURALLY YOU DEEP CONDITION MASQUE though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love this at first but... I began receiving compliments on my hair from a variety of people who see me everyday. They said my hair was shiny or simply asked what I used in my hair that day. Now I&#x27;m hooked; it does in fact hydrate my curls without the sticky stiff gel feel. Too bad it&#x27;s very hard to find locally. Love it.</li>
    <li> I dont do product reviews because i always think people just want attention or to complain....so I had dreads combed them out abd had o idea what to do with my hair....so many products...I tried a few with little success to tame my tresses. Then I saw this product...I did a twist out it came out fabulous....my curls are perfect coils and my hair is so soft...it smells great...and lasted...i really do love it...I stopped using motions products early 2000 but i am now officially back!</li>
    <li> Suitable for unruly, thick hair that is also curly and dry. I&#x27;m not sure how big tgat demographic is but I&#x27;m certainly in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t scientifically say that my hair is more moisturized but it does look shinier and I&#x27;m able to style it easier after the application of this product. YMMV.</li>
    <li> I am Jewish and have what I call Jew hair, hahahah My hair is very curly and dry. I work hydrate my curls into my hair when it is damp and let it dry naturally. It comes out so soft and shinny and the curls are defined without frizzies! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just over a year natural and I love my hair.  As it got longer it became harder to manage.  I use this product daily and I love it.  When I wash my hair I use Wen (another great product) and I use Motion NY Hydrate my Curls and it just does wonders for my hair.  My husband loves the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.  You have to find out the amount that works best for you.  I also use it when I just use a spray bottle to wet my hair and my curls look as I just did an awesome wash and go.  I&#x27;m in the process of adding this product to my subscribe and save because it is just that good.  I have very thick and curly hair.  For this stage of my journey this product will stay stocked.</li>
    <li> My hair is in love.  My 4b/c hair has a full blown relationship with this product! Every twist out or wash and go is done with this.  Though it gives light definition to my twist out, its very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole goal of buying this was to have moisture and frizz control.  Even though its short hair, its a lot of control and moisture without the expense and hype of other brands....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few products I keep on deck.  Cant wait to try the shampoo and conditioner.  To all ladies with hair that needa moisture and assistance.... this is it! But remember, it takes a good shampoo, conditioner, oil/sealant, and styling product to create a healthy head of hair.  Do what your hair is asking for, not what you want.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter says &amp;#34;It works Nana&amp;#34; manages her curly hair and she has difficult time with that.</li>
    <li> I tried this on daughter&#x27;s natural hair. It went on creamy and a gave her hair a temp. SHINE at that time. But once it dried the shine was gone.  Wasted  my money.</li>
    <li> Motions Hydrate My Curls Pudding is light, lightly fragranced and gives my curls life and they look great. Applying a quarter size amount distributed from roots to ends of my damp hair and air dried, my curls are well behaved without frizz. This is probably the best wash-n-go product I&#x27;ve used in a while with such good results. So much so I&#x27;d buy it AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even using my hair dryer&#x27;s diffuser kept the curls nice without frizz or the crispness some products cause. The reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 Stars is my curls are not very hydrated, something is missing. I&#x27;ve gone back to take another try with the Define My Curls which was just OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered Motions Naturally You Conditioner and the Conditioning Masque to see if I&#x27;ve found exactly the curly hair regimen I need in ONE product line. I&#x27;ll keep you updated.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do much in the way of beauty preparations so I am always looking for something that doesn&#x27;t take much work. This product fit the bill. I have naturally curly hair that tends to flatten as it dries but this product keeps my hair curlier for a longer period of time. I think it makes me look glamorous but that could be in my own mind. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something to hydrate my hair, because I dye it etc. Well, even with the tiniest dab, it made my hair feel like it had a pound of grease in it. I know, it&#x27;s marketed for African  American  hair, but if it hydrates, I&#x27;m gonna try it! No good this time.</li>
    <li> I have curly, over-processed hair and it tends to be fairly dry. I tried this  \\&quot;pudding\\&quot; on my hair and have to say I wasn&#x27;t really impressed. It helped with the fly-aways but didn&#x27;t really seem to hydrate my curls like I had hoped. I did like that this product is not sticky. Be sure not to use too much though because it can really weigh the hair down. As far as the scent goes, I would have to say it was pleasant and light.</li>
    <li> I have some curly hair and the only way to make it look neat is to use some kind of natural oil which will make it look very greasy.  But this product has all the good things of a natural oil without making it too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this and found this to be very helpful to keep my curls - shiny and nice</li>
    <li> My curls may have been shiny after the product application, but they were shiny like unwashed, greasy hair is shiny.  The healthy shine was not present at all.  Also, the product is heavy, such that my hair was still greasy hours after I put it in.  I was hoping for an alternative to mousse, which though it keeps curls in also renders hair \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; feeling.  I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I teach water aerobics and my curls can get very dry and brittle. Motions Naturally You, Hydrate My Curls Pudding has restored bounce, shine and defined my curls better than any other product I have used!&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER! Use Sparingly or risk having your hair look greasy!</li>
    <li> This product works about as well as jojoba oil, but the pudding texture makes it easier to distribute the product throughout the hair. Like jojoba oil, it will leave your hair and scalp feeling greasy. If you can stand the greasy feeling, it does a good job of fighting frizz and winter dryness.</li>
    <li> This product works well to define the curls that I have without making them look oily. This product has natural ingredients that make my hair smooth and soft to the touch. The cream keeps my hair from being frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and already purchased a second jar just so I wouldnt run out. I use it mostly for doing twists. It makes my hair feel softer and adds some sheen to my twists. When I do my partial twist outs I use this product the most and also on my scalp my hair stays flowy. I also use it as kind of a refresher for wash and go type styles when i dont wanna do more than a water spritzer and use this to make my hair look like i tried to do it. It is not an all natural product but if you dont mind that then this may be a good cheaper fit for you. Seems as if Im the only positive review so far so I guess its not for everyone. Also I put a dab of this in one of my oil spritzers for the smell and it worked out fine</li>
    <li> Our daughter is a caucasian 6 year old with curly hair (think Curly Sue). I mention this because there is a misperception that this product is only intended for African American usage. That is simply untrue- or at least it works for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though our daughter has incredibly curly hair naturally, there are times when the curls simply fall apart or just do not look good anymore (I guess the word flat or tangles is applicable). And, since she is hyper sensitive about how she looks when she leaves the house, she demands her hair be either 1) very curly or 2) completely straightened with a hair straightner. This product gives us the option to revitalize the curls very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We typically \\&quot;fix\\&quot; her curls when needed by using the [[ASIN:B007A592HU Motions Naturally You, Define My Curls Cr&amp;egrave;me, 8 Ounce]] as I describe in that review.  When we apply the Hydrate My Curls in combination, the curls get even curlier and very spring like and \\&quot;strong\\&quot; (sorry, that was the only word I could come up with to decribe it accurately). As is the case with any of these products, everyone responds differently  For example, I would not use this product on our daughter who has fine straight blondis hair. This product would be far too heavy and shiny and even appear greasy in her hair. But our daughter with curly hair has much different needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our usage, it is worth mentioning we wash her hair at a minimum every two days.  We found the product washes out fairly easily. We also do not use it all the time because it contains mineral oil, which our hair stylist says can damage hair over time.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for my daughters&#x27; naturally curly hair!  It helps control while allowing it to move beautifully.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet, but I know the manufacturer and have used other products from them, so I am sure that this one will be great.  The product was received timely and I love the smell and feel of it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but my wife, with her Italian genes, really fights frizz with her lovely black locks.  She&#x27;s growing her normally shorter hair out some for a wedding this fall that she&#x27;s in, and this pudding really helps keep the frizz away.  What else can I say?  I don&#x27;t use it, but she does, and she looks great!</li>
    <li> I wear my hair naturally, and I am frequently looking for new products to try. A lot of the products on the market are for relaxed, chemically treated hair. These products don&#x27;t necessarily harm natural hair, they don&#x27;t really help either. What I like about this product is the texture is similar to a few leave in other cremes, creamy but not too heavy, I have used, and the scent is mild. It certainly has a long list of ingredients to go along with the natural advertised materials on the label, shea butter, coconute and  avocado oil. The reason I gave it three stars is I don&#x27;t mind the product, but I didn&#x27;t see much of an improvement or anything that kept me using it. I rotate products  now and then, and I have not given up the line entirely. I do think the naturally part of the line has more to do with natural curls, like it says, than natural ingredients. What makes this a pudding and not a creme, I am not entirely sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the line another try, but with another product.</li>
    <li> First of all, hair products work differently for different people. I might love a product, while someone else hates it. We all have different needs in hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said.. this Motions Pudding is rather odd. When the hair is wet, it seems like it will turn out god, feels nice and looks nice, but once it dries, the hair is dry  and somewhat frizzy/crunchy looking, but somehow greasy. Very weird. I have never actually experienced anything like this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there is a hair type that this Pudding will work good on, but it isn&#x27;t mine, or my huband&#x27;s, or my niece&#x27;s - all with African American hair. My niece has biracial Caucasian &amp; African American hair, so I had thought it might work better for her since her hair isn&#x27;t as kinky or dry and is not as thick, but it was terrible on her, too. Her ringlets looked dry and \\&quot;dirty.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I am just using it up heavily with braiding, since it does have some oil/greasiness to it. I hate to waste and just throw stuff away...</li>
    <li> My wife describes Motions Naturally You, Hydrate My Curls Pudding as a good product that gave her curls more definition and softened her hair.  It has a light fresh scent and thick and creamy to the touch.  However, her scalp became dry and itchy.  She believes she had some sort of allergic reaction to the pudding.  This type of reaction is probably not common, but is likely to deter my wife for sure.</li>
    <li> Unlike \\&quot;Motions Naturally You, Define My Curls Crème, 8 Ounce\\&quot;, this product is not as greasy, so it is less likely to create a heavy, matted, \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look. The smell, as with the \\&quot;crème\\&quot;, is pleasant: not too sweet, not too strong if you are using just a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well on my hair, which is frizzy \\&quot;latino\\&quot; hair, so sort of a mix of traditionally black and traditionally white hair. This helped the frizz quite a bit and made the waves look a bit more controlled, adding some shine.&lt;br /&gt;Works better with wet hair or watered down if your hair isn&#x27;t Very curly, which mine isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to give this product such a low rating, but it&#x27;s product description basically forced my to. This product did little to nothing to tame my long hair. For something that advertised itself as providing a \\&quot;significant improvement,\\&quot; I was not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few positives to this hair product. It does wash out well. Many other hair products do not come out for days. But this stuff did not do anything else that was particularly helpful in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to hydrate your hair, look elsewhere. Hair products are not that expensive if you&#x27;re not buying brand names. This stuff is not worth your money.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, dry, and prone to serious frizziness.  I use a lot of different moisturizers and decided to give Motions Naturally You a try.  First off, a little of this stuff goes a long way.  If you use too much, you&#x27;ll end up with some greasy \\&quot;unwashed look\\&quot;.  I wasn&#x27;t aiming for that, so I tried out small amounts until I got the look I wanted - I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot to get my hair soft and manageable.  With an 8 ounce jar, this pudding will go a long way.  It&#x27;s not my favorite moisturizer, but it&#x27;s pretty good.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I received this product through the vine program. I have very dry hair and health issues and medications has caused my hair to be very damaged, breaking, thin and dry. I&#x27;ve been looking for something that I can use to keep my hair moisturized while wearing braids, weaves and wigs and this product does work . . . temporarily. The packaging advises users to use this product in conjunction with the \\&quot;Define My Curls Creme\\&quot; for desired results. It helped moisturize my hair for a short time, but when I slept, even with a silk scarf, I woke up to a greasy pillow, and by morning, my hair was just as dry as it was before I applied the product. Another issue I had with these products is that when I moisturized my hair with them and wore a head scarf, it gnatted my hair off. I recently had to cut out gobs of gnatted hair from my head and after examining the hair, I realize that the build up of this product after only a couple of uses made my hair dirty and itchy. If I have to wash my hair every day after using this product, that really defeats the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; issue.  I&#x27;d probably continue to use this product until I found something else that worked better, because \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot; is just not an option for me. Because this product was used in conjunction with the Creme, these reviews may be similar.</li>
    <li> I have dry, damaged, coarse 3b hair. I picked up this product from the store because I am low on my favorite moisturizing product and this was on clearance. Putting it on my dry hair, the first thing I noticed was how slippery it was- you can tell it is full of cones which I am not necessarily opposed. I also liked the scent a lot, it is a perfumey rather than natural scent but it was very nice. Then the product dried and it was horrid. My hair felt even more brittle, dry, rough, tangled... with this strange sort of thick grease coating that felt dry and somehow lacked any slip. I am neverdeviating from african pride&#x27;s olive miracle formula again. This product was awful and I can&#x27;t imagine a texture it would suit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll wash my natural hair and apply this then roll my hair and let it dry naturally.  I noticed that when I apply this to dry hair I get a sticky result.  It may work better for others.  But for me I like my hair to feel soft to the touch and not stiff and sticky.</li>
    <li> Whenever i used it on my bantu knot outs it made my hair feel very greasy. I dont prefer it. but i do like their shampoo and conditioner . But the conditioner doesnt go a long way, i always use a lot, and it doesnt provide any slip.</li>
    <li> I never liked Motions when I was relaxed and I was hesitant to buy this product because of all the bad reviews and it did not appeal to me. I have thick 4a/ 4b hair that was breaking for a while and I never had a defined twist out since I was natural this 3rd time around. I tried all the natural products sans parabens and mineral oils and they weighed down my hair and did not leave my hair defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product and wash my hair and conditioned it and used another leading leave in conditioner. I blow dried my hair on low heat and did medium small twist in my hair using this product. I suffer with 80 percent shrinkage when I add products in my hair that have water as the main ingredient. My hair was stretched with this product and shiny and not greasy as other people said on many other outlets. My twist were plump well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slept on it with a bonnet and two days later I unraveled my twist and I have perfectly defined twist outs. I have done the same method with scores of natural hair products and I am left with limp wet hair or twist that get flattened when I sleep or twist outs that lose definition in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is  now a staple and I find it locally where I live in the Caribbean.&lt;br /&gt;I am really tired of people complaining about mineral oil because it works for some people. My hair thrived in my other two natural hair journeys and I used grease and cheap oil moisturizers ...I just went back to relaxers ...My hair was breaking badly and not styling well with natural products. I feel duped because of all the money I spent in these products. It is day three and my hair is moisturized still and defined.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and I really like it...but beware, do NOT use too much! It will make your hair greasy and heavy.  The product is a pudding like texture so I just dab one finger in the top and that is all I use for my hair (it is long...about mid-back).  It keeps the frizz down and helps it hold curl. I wash my hair at night and put it up in socks to curl it and it comes out great each morning that I use this.  It is always more frizzy when I don&#x27;t use it.  It will last for a long time no more than you need to use to get the job done.  I used it one weekend as a hydrating balm for my hair to leave on for hours and wash off and it worked very well for that too.</li>
    <li> Living in Florida with lots of humidity can impose some serious challanges when it comes controlling hair frizz.  I also color my hair so additional moisture cannot hurt.  Although mu hair is straight, at times, when I style it, I like to use curling iron.  With this cream, I can make sure hair stays put and it does not get overworked by the hot, curling iron.  Product is salon strenght type product, it has good texture that is easy to work with and the product fragrance is fabulous.  It is one of thise styling products that even your hair stylist will ask you about because of the soft feel and wonderful scent.  Jar is quite large and it will last you for a long time, even if you have long hair.</li>
    <li> This product works well to condition my color treated hair, however its not something I can use as a daily leave in and be seen in public.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 40 something Caucasian female with color treated hair that is naturally wavy.  I tend to color quite often to cover my increasingly prominent gray hair.  I am always on the hunt for super conditioners and I&#x27;m willing to test most new hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied this pudding to my hair I was very pleased and instantly developed a little crush, hoping this would be my next great hair love.  Unfortunately the initial love faded rather quickly as the day progressed.  This was simply too heavy to wear in my hair out &amp; about.  After just a few hours my hair looked greasy and dirty, as if it hadn&#x27;t been washed in days.&lt;br /&gt;I did find that this is a great overnight hair moisturizer.  I left it in all night wrapped in a towel and washed my hair normally in the shower the next day.  The end result was it left my hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was going natural with my hair. So far I really like this product.  Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> When I got this styling pudding I did not know it was marketed for African-American hair care.  I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s very curly \\&quot;Jewfro\\&quot; hair, and it worked great!  It made her hair very shining and defined the curls without being sticky or greasy.  It also smells wonderful.  I prefer the styling pudding over the other curling products.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you probably have a slew of hair products you bought to try, used a few times, then decided you were sorry you bought them, so they go to the back of the cabinet until you clear it out and throw them away. So, it&#x27;s with a bit of skepticism I try new hair products any more. Many of them do a good initial job, but the next day you have to really work with your hair to try and get it looking good again. My hair is short, thick, and rather fine, so even with a layered cut I am always trying to give it some curl and volume. Enter this product...Motions Naturally - You Hydrate My Curls Pudding has been doing a phenomenal job with my hair. It leaves it soft, clean-feeling and gives a soft shine. I have used this 3 days in a row at times and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, limp or over-producted. Maybe that&#x27;s a new word, but you know what I mean. I wash my hair every 2-3 days and it&#x27;s nice not to have to wash it daily to remove styling products. I will also be reviewing another Motions Naturally styling product I really like as well--it does a great job in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this is you&#x27;re looking for a gently styling product. The consistency of this one really is like pudding. It only takes a small dab, about the size of a dime or less, to do the job. I use it on my fingertips and &#x27;hand-comb&#x27; my bangs and hair and it gives instant lift, nice definition and a soft shine.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:2dc73f286d48942ea09be1fb4de5ce66]] Wonderful product for all kinds of hair! A couple of friends tried it, as well as myself. With a little bit of experimenting, all loved it. The woman in the video knows the secret of many Jewish women...hair products targeted for AA women work wonders with their curly locks! For her, it worked best on dry hair. If she used it on wet it flaked and became grainy. When I used it, wet hair was best. So find the amount and moment that works best for you. As she said, a BIG plus is the very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;Any woman familiar with New York&#x27;s Ouidad salon knows about curly hair challenges. Here is a low cost product that hydrates, defines, and gives shine....IF you take the time with it.</li>
    <li> Motions Naturally You! Hydrate My Curls Pudding revives your dry hair and can help control the frizz. Hydrate My Curls can be used on relaxed hair, naturally curly hair or any other type of natural hair. I have a \\&quot;low-boy\\&quot; hair cut on the sides and back of my hair and this is excellent to keep your hair from becoming frizzy but more importantly it leaves a nice sheen over not only your hair but your scalp which can become dry as well with a short haircut. This product is also excellent on braids or the base of your weaves because braid-in extensions can break your hair if left untreated, but adding this to the base of the extensions can definitely prevent this from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and the container that it comes in makes it that much easier to distribute to your hair, unlike the bottles that similar products use. The only bad thing about this product is the name because many people will not benefit from this product because the name suggests it&#x27;s only for curls, but this product has a variety of uses and many people can benefit if the name were something different. Great Item, you will love it.</li>
    <li> My husband said be likes using this product but to me it looks like its drying out his hair. His hair has started to break off. He is using several products from this line so I don&#x27;t know which is causing the dryness and breakage. At first hus hair looked  better but not any more! One of the main ingredients in this product line is petroleum products (vasoline and/mineral oil) and I jusy don&#x27;t see how that can be good for hair.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of a pudding for hair, before. I had heard - and used - a putty-gel, but never experienced a pudding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fist of all....it LITERALLY looks like a pudding. It even FEELS like pudding. It was a bit weird for me to use it at first, but it quickly and easily worked into my hair, easier and quicker than any gel or mousse I had ever used, and I&#x27;ve used numerous gel and mousse varieties in the past ten years or so. I really enjoy, too, how light it is. To some extent, it feels like a cream, but not a heavy cream - the kind of cream put on skin for various reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much of a smell - like, it doesn&#x27;t smell strongly of chemicals - and it is not hard on the hair or the scalp. My hair is naturally curly, and this product does well at helping to enhance my curls, keeping that natural look. Additionally, the pudding seems to help hydrate my hair, making it look shiny (according to some) and helping just keep it healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it doesn&#x27;t come in a bottle or tube, it was initially weird for me to scoop it out with my fingers - &#x60;cause there is no scoop/paddle for which one can get some out....that might be a nice edition. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t really know what more to say. I can only really say good things about this...not much bad to say, yet there isn&#x27;t a TON I feel I can explain or expand more on unless asked. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this....and I THINK - I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s this product I used - one time a long-lost friend had seen me and after giving me a hug noted that my hair smelt nice. *I really don&#x27;t think it has much of a smell, but apparently what smell it DOES have is pleasant. :)</li>
    <li> Not as creamy as I anticipated, but, its light, oily without being greasy..the oil is very light. Nice scent. Must keep container airtight or composition changes quickly. Use with Sateen not your real silk head-wraps.</li>
    <li> this product was light for my hair . when I washed my hair it would be ok but doesn&#x27;t work to well with dry hair and where I live I can not have wet hair every day</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and I tried this on a rainy day, on wet hair. It did a good job of defrizzing but I didn&#x27;t like the way it flattened my hair. Also using this, it took longer for my hair to dry. Plus, canister this comes in is open and the stuff could easily fall out or get contaminated.</li>
    <li> I love sampling new products (I&#x27;m a hair care and makeup junkie), and was eager to try this out.  For my fine, wavy hair, this product is too heavy, but I&#x27;m not marking off for that since I knew before choosing this that this product was designed for thicker, curlier hair.  I gave a sample of it to my friend who has thick, 4B/4C curls, and she loves it.  She said that it leaves her curls frizz-free and defined, with not much crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also really nice on this, and it is easy to apply.  It&#x27;s worth trying out if you have thicker hair.</li>
    <li> The product goes a long way. Only a little is needed for maximum results. My wife applied it and was pleased with the results.Her hair appeared \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with a shiny veneer , and was very attractive.&lt;br /&gt;She is currently trying other products in the line.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice, high quality hair product. Rich, thick, and creamy, a little goes a surprisingly long way, even in my thick, snarly hair, and it left my girls do smooth and bouncy and defined for days. The scent is pleasant, but thankfully, not overwhelming. I would seriously say that this is at least as good, if not better, as the Miss Jessie brand.</li>
</ol>
