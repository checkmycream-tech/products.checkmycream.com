      <li>and it&#x27;s something that works given time and consistency like most regimens.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product</li>
      <li>I have tried many products and none of them worked.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>This cream was not too greasy, but somehow lasted many more hours.</li>
      <li>my skin never looked better since I started using this product.</li>
      <li>I don’t like to pack my face with to many staff.</li>
      <li>this product arrived in a decent amount of time, in great packaging as well.</li>
      <li>Incredible for face, love it highly recommend worth the money.</li>
      <li>this is something you can use and of course read the ingredients label and check with a primary care doctor to be safe</li>
      <li>a great product to alternate with retinol gel-cream</li>
      <li>My mom commented that my skin looks porcelain smooth.     </li>
      <li>medium to light brown</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>I was sure I had time though because these things never work immediately right?</li>
      <li>But if you want to use it in the day time make sure to put sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher.</li>
      <li>Its worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Used twice per day, and once per day after the skin has significantly recuced brown spots.</li>
      <li>As far as how well it works, it&#x27;s​ a good product in my own personal opinion.</li>
      <li>I would have never imagined that any product would begin working so quickly, but this one did.</li>
      <li>Works adequately over time.  </li>
      <li>the product was in a condition that matched the description which was &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; so I am very satisfied with my overall purchase and the delivery.</li>
      <li>: This product is very potent so if you are black/African and DO NOT want to change the overall complexion of your skin, just use it on the problem areas...</li>
      <li>It lightened up the first day !</li>
      <li>so I wanted to even out my tone and keep it a bright as could be despite the sun making it seem darker and more dull.</li>
      <li>It is pricy but worth it</li>
      <li>all the potions we are putting on our skin are going directly into the bloodstream and are causing us to be toxic and thus greater chance of cancer.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years with much success (it clears blemishes faster than any other similar product I know of, without damaging my skin), so it was wonderful to find it at an affordable price.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a significant change over two months of use.</li>
      <li>I Used this product on a blemish i have on my shoulder &amp; on my right temple.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first to spend $65.00 on a product that may or may not work, but it is totally worth the price tag.  </li>
      <li>I used it for three days and my dark blotches begin to disappear great product I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Use this twice a day I was told, and for the first time in my life I had to start using sunblock.</li>
      <li>I was deployed to Jordan for 6 months and was able to use it the entire time there</li>
      <li>This cream really works!</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it is suppose to do without any redness or damage to your skin.</li>
      <li>This product made a very noticeable difference in my face overnight!</li>
      <li>First of all, it&#x27;s vehicle is mineral oil.</li>
      <li>If it had actually lightened my skin as well I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars and bought more of it,</li>
      <li>but if you stop be aware your dark spots will be more evident then ever before!!</li>
      <li>I have large brown patching on my neck caused by hormonal changes.  </li>
      <li>i really dont know if i notice a difference.</li>
      <li>It cost as much as the prescription product</li>
      <li>My skin is so much clearer and radiant after using this cream.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.  </li>
      <li>I really hope this cream will works for me somehow.</li>
      <li>Really helps with brown aging spots.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t notice much in the way of results.</li>
      <li>it really works you can see results in just two days</li>
      <li>I cant really tell if this is working</li>
      <li>, I can tell you the spots are 95% gone, really</li>
      <li>I read several good reviews on this product and the percentage of hydroquinone was higher in this product than any of the previously prescribed creams.</li>
      <li>I did notice some redness or red blotches at first, but it was mild and eventually went</li>
      <li>Please be aware before using this, I do have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very rich and creamy texture and works very good in dry cold weather, but I don&#x27;t think it will suit my combo skin in warmer weather.</li>
      <li>Although after the first time trying it, the cream did clear up the spots significantly, I kept trying it for two weeks and the darkness stayed the same.</li>
      <li>Ok so I have had a dark ring around my neck for many years due to hyper pigmentation.</li>
      <li>I am using it on the top of my hands, and it is fading my dark spots.  </li>
      <li>I have used many products in an attempt to fade my dark spots.</li>
      <li>and I am excited to see even more progress over the next few months.</li>
      <li>, it made my skin look very even and allowed the natural glow</li>
      <li>This is the second time I purchased this product, because this is the first one which really worked for me.</li>
      <li>(I get dark spots easily) and this was recommended to me by a skin dr.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even after washing my face the next morning with an oil control cleanser, my face was still very very oily.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>so far Not !</li>
      <li>ever since I was pregnant with my daughter over 2 1/2 years ago, and I&#x27;m extremely self-conscious about the \\&quot;spots\\&quot; on my face.</li>
      <li>it might clear the spots out</li>
      <li>After 6 months the use of twice per week is sufficient to maintain a clear and even skin tone.</li>
      <li>As far as its bleaching power-</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin prone to contact dermatitis (I can&#x27;t even use products that have any fragrance without my face reacting within hours), but I have zero issues with this cream.</li>
      <li>but it did fade some old acne scarring.</li>
      <li>Note: I am a 21 year old black/African woman...</li>
      <li>I was at least pleased with those results, thus the 3 stars.</li>
      <li>I am 40 years old</li>
      <li>its too early to tell</li>
      <li>but then it gives a natural result.</li>
      <li>From pregnancy  the Hormonal imbalance we get)I had several parts much darker ..</li>
      <li>I Must admit I&#x27;m a busy busy mom and never have time to write reviews</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a middle aged male with the onset of dark spots on my face, I used this product at first locally on the spots and then as I became more aware of any possible reactions I started using it as a face cream.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not the first product that i have tried, but it will definitely be the last...</li>
      <li>Although this product didn&#x27;t accomplish my goal of lightening my dark spots AT ALL even after using it religiously for 3 months, I have very dry, ashy skin on my feet, knees, and elbows and most lotions I buy are either too greasy or don&#x27;t last for more than a few hrs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have dark brown-gray melasma on my cheeks, temples and above eyebrows. I&#x27;ve tried numerous bleaching/fading products as well as Fraxel laser treatments. I read several good reviews on this product and the percentage of hydroquinone was higher in this product than any of the previously prescribed creams. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. First of all, it&#x27;s vehicle is mineral oil. I also suffer from extremely oily skin and adding oil to an oil problem made my face like an oil slick. So I decided to only use it at bedtime.  Same issue. Even after washing my face the next morning with an oil control cleanser, my face was still very very oily. So caution to those with oily skin.  As far as its bleaching power- It definitely bleaches skin. However, in my case, it didn&#x27;t reduce or fade my melasma but it did fade some old acne scarring. The skin around my melasma became lighter and a little ashy looking which actually made the melasma look darker. So I decided to continue using the cream but only applying it to the darkest areas and meticulously keeping to the dark skin using a q-tip to apply.  It&#x27;s been two weeks applying in this manner and I have not seen improvement. Only reddening, which goes away after washing, and majorly oily skin. I don&#x27;t think this product works well for moderately-severe melasma unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Note: I am a 21 year old black/African woman... Skin color: medium to light brown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because i have some dark spots on my face that were caused by acne... My acne is all gone but the spots refused to disappear so my intention was to use this product on the spots in order to get rid of them. I use this only at night on my spots because i don&#x27;t want to damage my skin by exposing it to the sun with this cream on. But if you want to use it in the day time make sure to put sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. In less than a week the black spots on my face faded to almost nothing. I&#x27;ve had this product for about three weeks now and the spots just keep on fading...&lt;br /&gt;This is not the first product that i have tried, but it will definitely be the last... i also used it to fade dark circles around my eyes, now my skin is almost as clear as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This product is very potent so if you are black/African and DO NOT want to change the overall complexion of your skin, just use it on the problem areas...</li>
    <li> so heavy on my skin. i started getting small rashes on my face. what a rip off for the price!!! do not buyyyyyyyyyyyyyy doesnt even lighten.</li>
    <li> Hmmm.  I didn&#x27;t see any improvement after a week or two of use.</li>
    <li> Works adequately over time.  zinc sunscreen must always be worn to prevent re-occurance of spots!</li>
    <li> It works. It might not work overnight, but it does work. My skin is hyperpigmented (I get dark spots easily) and this was recommended to me by a skin dr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this twice a day I was told, and for the first time in my life I had to start using sunblock. \\&quot;It has to be at least SPF30.\\&quot; So my skin regime was changed to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it stinks. Secondly, it&#x27;s pretty thick, so not the easiest to spread evenly, but I just put two fingertips in the cream, and rub it between my hands and rub it all over my face. Thirdly, it&#x27;s kind of pricey. Granted, the jar does last for a while though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a total cure for everyone. It&#x27;s a bleach, not a miracle cure. For scars, maybe go with some Mederma. It works for me, and I still use it.</li>
    <li> The label falsely suggest  6% hydroquinone. When the product actually contains 2% hydroquinone, 2% kojic acid, and 2% bearberry extract.  I felt like I was tricked into buying the product (this is why I took off two stars). I was going to return it once I received it, but i decided to give it a little try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works. I&#x27;ve been prescribed 4% hydroquinone before and this product actually works a bit faster and is gentler on my skin. In combination with tretinoin (a retinoic acid for acne treatment) I&#x27;ve seen major improvement within 3 days and I only used the product at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m a dark skinned african american with eczema. I only say this because I read reviews and I wish people would put their skin type and color. Lots of things just don&#x27;t work for darker skin tones or eczema and acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in timely manner and works good. You have to use it faithfully to get the results you want but it does work. Thinking about ordering another jar.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  This type of product requires time to work, so at this point I have not much to go on.</li>
    <li> One of the few over-the-counter, topical products I&#x27;ve found that works to gradually fade spots and freckles. It&#x27;s a constant battle and not a long term solution, but it does help. Amazon prime delivery was prompt and the packaging protective.</li>
    <li> The product does not work. Maybe it&#x27;s just on my skin type.</li>
    <li> This cream really works! It is fading the spots off my legs that I have been trying to get rid of for years!</li>
    <li> I Must admit I&#x27;m a busy busy mom and never have time to write reviews but I had to set the time to do so..&lt;br /&gt;I recieved it yesterday and couldnt wait to slap it on. From pregnancy  the Hormonal imbalance we get)I had several parts much darker ..(if you know what I mean) I was so self conscious about it! It lightened up the first day ! wow! Its worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for month, but I couldn&#x27;t wait any longer to write a review.      I&#x27;ve had melasma (pregnancy mask) ever since I was pregnant with my daughter over 2 1/2 years ago, and I&#x27;m extremely self-conscious about the \\&quot;spots\\&quot; on my face. A cousin who works as an esthetician recommended I go to my dermatologist and get a 4% hydroquinone cream. After doing some research I decided to order the Clinicians Complex cream because of the 6% claim, and the one review I read made the product seem somewhat promising. I admit I was nervous that there are no new reviews of this product in almost 2 years, but I went for it anyway.     The day this product came I used it immediately.  I wanted to take \\&quot;before\\&quot; pictures so I would have them for comparison later, but I didn&#x27;t do it that night. I was sure I had time though because these things never work immediately right? Wrong!  This product made a very noticeable difference in my face overnight! Just one application! I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if it hadn&#x27;t happened to me. And it&#x27;s not just me who notices it, within a week my husband said he couldn&#x27;t see my \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot; from across the room anymore.  My mom commented that my skin looks porcelain smooth.     I would have never imagined that any product would begin working so quickly, but this one did. It hardly takes any effort now to cover up my spots with make-up, and they are getting lighter and lighter every week. I am also very happy to say that this cream does not cause any irritation at all. I have extremely sensitive skin prone to contact dermatitis (I can&#x27;t even use products that have any fragrance without my face reacting within hours), but I have zero issues with this cream. If anything my skin is even smoother in the areas I&#x27;m using it.    I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product and I am excited to see even more progress over the next few months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I have never seen 6% bleaching cream offered.  Even the doctor gives you 4% and it&#x27;s more expensive and you have to get a prescription.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see dramatic results, but I&#x27;d buy it again.  Seems to be doing the job and for alot less money!</li>
    <li> I have used many products in an attempt to fade my dark spots. Most products either break me out worse or simply do not work. HOWEVER, Clinicians bleaching cream started working overnight! This product is AMAZING. I am 40 years old and I have dark spots from when I was a teenager and it has started to fade them. My skin is so much clearer and radiant after using this cream. Within 6 weeks I noticed a lifetime difference by using it. GREAT PRODUCT, FAST, RELIABLE results!</li>
    <li> Was just ok. Didn&#x27;t get any amazing results. Was too costly for the results.</li>
    <li> So I have black spots between my thighs and in my belly button line, I have always suffered from this. Before I tried using this cream vitamin e was helping diminish the spots but I then decided to use this bleaching cream. Although after the first time trying it, the cream did clear up the spots significantly, I kept trying it for two weeks and the darkness stayed the same. I decided to stop to see what would happen and my dark spots got darker then before!!! Please be aware before using this, I do have very sensitive skin but I am not sure why it got darker then before I started using the crean. Also now I have tried putting vitamin e and now that doesn&#x27;t work either!! again yeah it might clear the spots out but if you stop be aware your dark spots will be more evident then ever before!! at least in my case!</li>
    <li> its too early to tell</li>
    <li> I really hope this cream will works for me somehow. It came to me with dented container and cap, but I can live with it, as long as the cream is not contaminated and works on my acne scar. I&#x27;ve been using this cream diligently for over a month and can&#x27;t see too much different on my acne scar. I gave 2 stars, for moisturizing agent. It&#x27;s very rich and creamy texture and works very good in dry cold weather, but I don&#x27;t think it will suit my combo skin in warmer weather. I also feels it&#x27;s really hard to absorbed into my skin, feels like the cream only sit as an extra layer on my skin and last thing, I don&#x27;t like jar type container, I prefer something in a bottle or tube that I can squeeze the product out rather than dip my finger everytime I use the product.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is suppose to do without any redness or damage to your skin. This cleared up a few marks I had on my face. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Well I was hoping this would work on a scar I have.  But sadly it didn&#x27;t lighten it at all.  After about 3 weeks of using it, it just irritated my skin by making it red and itchy.</li>
    <li> I used this every day/night for a month on my hyper pigmentation I got from pregnancy.. Never saw any improvement.</li>
    <li> Ok so I have had a dark ring around my neck for many years due to hyper pigmentation. I have gotten chemical peels on my neck tried lemon juice, nothing worked. I started using this faithfully for a couple weeks and def noticed a difference. My ring is almost gone and the reason it is not 100% gone is because I have been slacking on using this everyday. I have not even finished the bottle yet. It is pricy but worth it and I don&#x27;t feel so embarrassed anymore. I will buy another bottle just to keep on hand. I think I will try this on my elbows next. I also did not develop any rashes or bad reactions, I almost want to cry I am so happy I found something that works,</li>
    <li> I purchased this  product to treat Melasma on my face. The Dermatologist had previously prescribed a 4% bleaching cream that was working and had removed 50% of the dark spots.  When I ran out I decided to try this 6% bleaching cream. I have been very disappointed and have not seen any improvement in the dark spots after using for 2 months.  It cost as much as the prescription product and  I definitely will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and the birthmark on my neck is almost gone. It&#x27;s a slow process but then it gives a natural result.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell whether this product works or not because I only used it for a week and my breakout got worse but one thing I do know is it&#x27;s way too freaking expensive.</li>
    <li> The Physician&#x27;s Asst. at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office recommended this product.  I bought it from them.  I used it all, and followed her directions, but I don&#x27;t see any noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to spend $65.00 on a product that may or may not work, but it is totally worth the price tag.  I have dark under-eye circles from heredity and have tried everything under the sun with very little to no good results.  Within 2 weeks of using this product, under my eyes are close to being the same complex as the rest of my face. Everyone has noticed a dramatic difference (good-bye makeup).  The product is a little bit greasy, but it works.  I apply it twice a day under my eyes.  The 2oz bottle should last me a long time since I only use it under my eyes.  Wish I had found this product sooner.</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t do any changes for me and I used it for 3-4 weeks. I have discovered using hydroquinone and kojic acid products in jars is ineffective because of the air contamination. Others say it works though? If you got some freckles you want to lose..it didn&#x27;t for me. Atleast not fast enough .</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the ingredients.....when I use things on my skin, I hope to get good ingredients and do not want sodium laurel sulfate to be in what I am using....all the potions we are putting on our skin are going directly into the bloodstream and are causing us to be toxic and thus greater chance of cancer.  The body has to fight the crap and thus cancer cells spring up then we have to kill the cancer and usually kills us in the process....</li>
    <li> this product arrived in a decent amount of time, in great packaging as well. the product was in a condition that matched the description which was &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; so I am very satisfied with my overall purchase and the delivery. As far as how well it works, it&#x27;s​ a good product in my own personal opinion. I&#x27;m a dark skinned African American and I take pride in my complexion so I wanted to even out my tone and keep it a bright as could be despite the sun making it seem darker and more dull. I&#x27;ve used this numerous times over the last two year and it&#x27;s something that works given time and consistency like most regimens. I was deployed to Jordan for 6 months and was able to use it the entire time there, it made my skin look very even and allowed the natural glow ( although I&#x27;m dark) to come through so I think it does a great job. I&#x27;m no expert on whether you should choose a bleaching agent over something that just says it &amp;#34;evens tone&amp;#34; but obviously you should do a small area test on your skin to make sue this is something you can use and of course read the ingredients label and check with a primary care doctor to be safe but it works for me and get results but if you are in the sun a lot the result won&#x27;t last forever.</li>
    <li> a great product to alternate with retinol gel-cream</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me, and I had to throw it out because the cream turned yellow-ish.</li>
    <li> my wife wanted it and she is happy and thats all that really matters cant give and honest reveiw not for me</li>
    <li> I used as directed with no results.  May the hyper-pigmentation is too deep and this product only works on surface pigmentation?</li>
    <li> Hard to find bleaching cream with this condensed hydroquinone. Really helps with brown aging spots. I use sparingly! Very good consistency!</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day as recommended (in the a.m. and p.m.) since I received it and I have seen no change whatsoever. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Incredible for face, love it highly recommend worth the money.</li>
    <li> This expensive product caused strong hyperpigmentation - opposite effect of goal.  I have used product in the past but from another seller and had favorable results.  I would never buy here again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice much in the way of results.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist sold this to me.  I have a brown spot just behind my left eye.  I have tried everything to get it removed.  My dermatologist even spayed it with cryofreeze.  It pealed in the middle but left an outline on the outside and it looks like it is coming back.  I wish this would work -but so far Not !</li>
    <li> i really dont know if i notice a difference. tried almost everything to get rid of dark acne spots. used it for a few months every night.</li>
    <li> I have large brown patching on my neck caused by hormonal changes.  I have tried many products and none of them worked. I understand that brown spots and patches from sun damage is easier to correct, so didn&#x27;t expect great results.  This product works, but it took a long time for me to see any difference - but I do see some lightening of the brown patches.  They are not totally gone, but are definately lighter, so I have decided to stay with this product because it&#x27;s the only one that has shown any improvement at all. I use it daily and always wear sun screen over the area.  Now I don&#x27;t have to paste on heavy makeup on my neck, which is a blessing!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  and does what it is supposed to do...my skin never looked better since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  I am using it on the top of my hands, and it is fading my dark spots.  I have a few on my face, becareful, dab this product on the spots only.  I was spreading it all over my face and got blisters, so beware.  Nice to have a product do, what it says it will do.  A little pricey but I need the 6 percent.</li>
    <li> Product is too expensive for what it can do. i am not impressed. did not see any results and it is very small.</li>
    <li> (Purchased 2 bottles,  one for my sister &amp; one for myself) I Used this product on a blemish i have on my shoulder &amp; on my right temple. Used it for two weeks, twice a day. Then i used it once a day for the following weeks, it did not notice a change on my blemish. Very disappointed.  My sister has brown markings around her armpits. She also used this product twice a day for weeks, there was no change on her brown marks. .......again, very disappointing.  I will not use or recommend this product, waste of time &amp; money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, any results happened I just wasted my money 😤😤</li>
    <li> great value.  the same as i buy from kaiser&#x27;s cosmetic services department.  i looked online to get it cheaper.  rotate manufacturers every time you run out of product because your skin can get used to it and it&#x27;ll seem like it isn&#x27;t working anymore.  also, hyperpigmentation isn&#x27;&#x27;t just caused by sun!  heat counts, too.  i use this or another bleaching cream in my rotation daily</li>
    <li> Used for about 3 months. Did nothing at all to lighten dark spots.</li>
    <li> This product haven&#x27;t shown any changes  since I started using it. For a product that cost so much, it&#x27;s not worth it.I&#x27;m almost at the bottom of the jar and there is no improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Although this product didn&#x27;t accomplish my goal of lightening my dark spots AT ALL even after using it religiously for 3 months, I have very dry, ashy skin on my feet, knees, and elbows and most lotions I buy are either too greasy or don&#x27;t last for more than a few hrs. on my skin. This cream was not too greasy, but somehow lasted many more hours. I was at least pleased with those results, thus the 3 stars. If it had actually lightened my skin as well I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars and bought more of it, but it&#x27;s too expensive just to use as a lotion.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto&lt;br /&gt;todos debirian de comprar esto&lt;br /&gt;se los recomiendo, es completamente excelente en tama&amp;ntilde;o y calidad&lt;br /&gt;envi&amp;oacute; r&amp;aacute;pido....</li>
    <li> I got the product based on recommendations from my esthetician to assist with a skin pigmentation/sun spots. I really didn&#x27;t see a significant change over two months of use. I don&#x27;t care much for the smell or waking up to a crusty the thin layer of dried cream on my face.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product because I the other products I ordered did not do the job.  I am a licensed Aesthetician and the ingredients in this product as just what is needed to move &#x27;dark spots&#x27;.  Although, I have only used the product for a few days, I already see a very small improvement.  I believe this product will do the trick!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought 3 jars of this product and working on my second jar...still waiting to see a difference in with my melanin spots, but nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this product claim to do...yea, right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to no one!</li>
    <li> Clinicians complex 6 percent skin bleaching it really works you can see results in just two days it&#x27;s really amazing I would recommend this product to everybody</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged male with the onset of dark spots on my face, I used this product at first locally on the spots and then as I became more aware of any possible reactions I started using it as a face cream.  It took about 4 weeks to see obvious improvement, after 3 months (same jar), I can tell you the spots are 95% gone, really impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now before you buy this product do some research on its active ingredients, although widely used around the world there is a lot of controversy.  This tells me that some people may have a variety of reactions to the cream.  My advice is to do what I did, start slow and watch, when your comfortable increase the area, if you have any reaction well then this ones not for you.  I did notice some redness or red blotches at first, but it was mild and eventually went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it about 2-3 times a week for maintenance, as I understand it if you discontinue use, the spots will return in time.  So I&#x27;m searching for the least amount of applications to keep my face free and clear of melasma spots.</li>
    <li> definitely lightened but not gone</li>
    <li> Bought this at the start of May, paid through the nose and it never arrived! I was swayed by the rave reviews too but stay away. PS Amazon have refused to publish this review before so unsure whether it will go through this time</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Changed my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried other bleaching creams and this one did not perform either.  My sun spots are still there and the texture of my skin has not changed.  I am really very disappointed and will not use it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years with much success (it clears blemishes faster than any other similar product I know of, without damaging my skin), so it was wonderful to find it at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my niece I used it for three days and my dark blotches begin to disappear great product I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> It works, too well I might add because the dark area I wanted to fade got lighter than the rest of my body and when I stopped using it, it reverted..:( very disappointing. Now I have to shop for another product not as strong, expensive and with longer lasting results.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m olive skin, I tried it as directed for 3 weeks. The difference it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money. Did nothing at all for dark aging spots. No appreciable color correction at all. Save your money</li>
    <li> I beg to differ with those who say this product doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve always had freckles and brown spots and this&lt;br /&gt;Clinicians Complex Cream absolutely works for me. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It lasts a long time, also.&lt;br /&gt;Frananna27</li>
    <li> The product arrived in time. This is the second time I purchased this product, because this is the first one which really worked for me. The results after about 2- 3 months are just amazing. Used twice per day, and once per day after the skin has significantly recuced brown spots. After 6 months the use of twice per week is sufficient to maintain a clear and even skin tone.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used for melasma.  I notice a difference in a week, and by 4 weeks it is so faded you can barely see it.  This is my second jar and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I cant really tell if this is working but I would not purchase it again I don&#x27;t feel like it does much dark spots didn&#x27;t really fade with this cream</li>
    <li> I use one or one and a half month and take two weeks break. This makes it more effective for me.  Like everything else our skin will get used to it. Also bleaching products makes skin dryer. I don’t like to pack my face with to many staff. When I don’t use bleach, I moisturize it.</li>
    <li> Its lightening target areas. Its only been 2wks or so. I do see difference!</li>
