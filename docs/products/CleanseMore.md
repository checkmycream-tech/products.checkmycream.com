      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>If you use them too much, you enter into colon blow.  </li>
      <li>I have a condition that makes me very constipated, but this product negates that.</li>
      <li>Rhubarb really helps with motility.  </li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t think too much of it.  </li>
      <li>The slippery elm that is in this product is very soothing to the gut.  </li>
      <li>Really works well, cleans you out like it says.</li>
      <li>This product has been an amazing wonderful answer for our child with Down Syndrome who has the typical \\&quot;slow gut\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>My daughter told me about this cleanse, I had tried so many other that didn&#x27;t do the job</li>
      <li>After researching Ingredients, I found that rhubarb is linked to allergies due to toxins in leaves and stems and many cannot tolerate the toxicity of anthroquinolones.</li>
      <li>I love renew life and can&#x27;t wait to try other products</li>
      <li>The only downside for me is that I get a stomach from it sometimes, but it&#x27;s totally worth it to me!</li>
      <li>Cannot live without this!  </li>
      <li>I started taking this 30 days before seeing him daily and the more aggressive prep was not necessary.</li>
      <li>My doctor put me on a high fiber diet and told me to take Metamucil.</li>
      <li>Highly recommending.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for anybody who would like to cleanse their system of the garbage we put into knowingly and unknowingly.  </li>
      <li>I completely swear by it and have introduced many people to this product and this company&#x27;s other products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a natural colan cleanser.</li>
      <li>It helps very naturally and doesn&#x27;t have side effects.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After looking more closely at the ingredients (and ruling out marshmallow and slippery elm, as I&#x27;ve taken both before), I can only guess that my reaction was due to the rhubarb root.  </li>
      <li>After looking at other reviews of this product (some from other sellers), I learned that many bottles have loose powder coating the capsules, presumably from one capsule opening inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than trusting my gut that these things should be spit out, I diligently wiped off two new capsules and swallowed them quickly.  </li>
      <li>if you are trying to loose weight this will help and keeping you working right</li>
      <li>Product should have clear warning label.</li>
      <li>Reliable, natural and always works.</li>
      <li>My daughter recommended this because it is all natural and I have had problems for years.</li>
      <li>the product is all natural and works , but I feel it should come with a warning label I had a colonoscopy on 11-29-10</li>
      <li>It is not a laxative but a natural combination of herbs that lets your body do the work.</li>
      <li>and my doctor told me my colon was black due to use of clease more.</li>
      <li>I would highly suggest that anyone who purchases this set an alarm 2-3 hours after going to sleep on the first night - just to be sure that you aren&#x27;t sleeping through a bad reaction.</li>
      <li>It makes going completely stress-free and nearly instant.</li>
      <li>My colon with go back to normal in time with a proper diet</li>
      <li>I popped two pills in the back of my mouth, and although I had water already in the other hand ready to wash it down, the taste was so horrendous that my natural reaction was to spit them back out!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great product, and it works a lot better than other products I&#x27;ve tried. The only downside for me is that I get a stomach from it sometimes, but it&#x27;s totally worth it to me!</li>
    <li> Great transaction...great product.</li>
    <li> When I say studies back it up... I mean go to the PubMed site and look up the medical studies on Triphala and also on Rhubarb and how they affect digestion/pooping.  This product has been an amazing wonderful answer for our child with Down Syndrome who has the typical \\&quot;slow gut\\&quot;.  Rhubarb really helps with motility.  The slippery elm that is in this product is very soothing to the gut.  For parents of kids with DS - we also use a product called Digest by a co. called Enzymedica.  It&#x27;s a digestive aide and the combo of the two helps our child be healthy and regular.  We love this product!!  :)</li>
    <li> these are the best way to \\&quot;get things moving\\&quot; again.  it is hydrating to your colon unlike a laxative, so you will receive long term benefits from it.  can be taken nightly for a short time as a nourishing way to cleanse your colon and get your digestive fires up and burning again!    ~sarajean walsh.  kripalu yoga teacher/NASM CPT/ayurvedic consultant in training.</li>
    <li> I used to have elimination problems! And this product works well!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now and it really is the best!! I would recommend this to anyone having difficulty staying regular.</li>
    <li> Works well, I am using it for years now. Contains powerful herbal combination with no aditives or binders. Highly recommending.</li>
    <li> the ONLY thing that&#x27;s kept me regular for years!</li>
    <li> Cleanse More is a natural cleansing product.  I use it regularly and it works as anticipated.  I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a natural colan cleanser.</li>
    <li> This item is very good and helpful. It helps very naturally and doesn&#x27;t have side effects. I&#x27;ve been taking it for several years and very satisfied.</li>

    <li> For many years as long I can remember it seems like constipation was part of the family. But after taking 2 in the evening for four days (Yes I obtained very loose stools those days) I almost gave up on it because I thought it was like any other lax. But then my bowel movements were regular for months!!! Like never before.  I have not even finished a jar for a year now because after that I might need to take one or two every two months just when I see my organisim slowing down. (I am hypotyroid so those who are also undersatand me). Thanks. I am thinking of trying other products for cleansing. Lets see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about a year. Nice and mild and work great. I would recommend it, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> No cramping. No harmful senna or cascara segrada.  Works like clockwork. A lifesaver for a person who suffers with chronic constipation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product and omg this should be the #1 most natural product out there I took it at night and that next morning I went naturally no cramps no stomach ache nothing just a little gas I went nice and soft no hard stools no straining simply just great I love renew life and can&#x27;t wait to try other products I was so skepticle got so long and a great guy from vitamine shop have me his honest opinion about it sold me on it I took it and I went. I usually go once a week if that now I go every other day thank u to whom ever made this it&#x27;s great. Plus no cascarga or senna which means no stomach ache no dependency. Xoxo</li>
    <li> the long-haired colonel swears by them</li>
    <li> It makes going completely stress-free and nearly instant. I completely swear by it and have introduced many people to this product and this company&#x27;s other products. They are the best bowel care company around. Take one though, not two!</li>
    <li> gentle cleanse. it works. So glad I found it online since I can not find it local where I live now</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this because it is all natural and I have had problems for years. I had visited my Doctor last year and he was not able to perform a complete colonoscopy due to blockage. He told me to return in a year and he would give me a more aggressive prep. I started taking this 30 days before seeing him daily and the more aggressive prep was not necessary. It is part of my daily routine now. I have not experienced any adverse reactions.</li>
    <li> I received this product in the mail yesterday, and took it before bedtime last night, as suggested on the bottle.  I popped two pills in the back of my mouth, and although I had water already in the other hand ready to wash it down, the taste was so horrendous that my natural reaction was to spit them back out!  It was like acid on my tongue, it was terrible!  After looking at other reviews of this product (some from other sellers), I learned that many bottles have loose powder coating the capsules, presumably from one capsule opening inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than trusting my gut that these things should be spit out, I diligently wiped off two new capsules and swallowed them quickly.  With a taste lingering on my tongue and lips, I gulped down about a liter of water before bed.  And I&#x27;m thankful that I did, otherwise I believe I would have slept through what were the scariest side effects I&#x27;ve ever experienced before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was awake about an hour after taking the pills, and on 3 separate occasions I felt my heart flutter.  While this was definitely noteworthy, I do experience flutters sometimes so I didn&#x27;t think too much of it.  Then about 2 1/2 hours later, I woke up to urinate.  When I stood up, I almost fell over and had to catch my balance on the wall.  The whole room was spinning!  Then I recognized that I was SEVERELY dehydrated!  My mouth, nose, and even my eyes were dry!  Now I&#x27;ve been thirsty before, but I&#x27;ve never had my eyelids &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; because my eyes were so dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking more closely at the ingredients (and ruling out marshmallow and slippery elm, as I&#x27;ve taken both before), I can only guess that my reaction was due to the rhubarb root.  Because of this terrifying reaction, I have chunked these pills out.  I would highly suggest that anyone who purchases this set an alarm 2-3 hours after going to sleep on the first night - just to be sure that you aren&#x27;t sleeping through a bad reaction.</li>
    <li> works great swear buy this product 3rd time I have bought it good price too also if you are trying to loose weight this will help and keeping you working right</li>
    <li> everything as expected</li>
    <li> I take this product every night before I go to bed, and it keeps me regular. I have a condition that makes me very constipated, but this product negates that.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and recently found it causes cell damage in the colon called Melanosis leading to a black colon ...the product is all natural and works , but I feel it should come with a warning label I had a colonoscopy on 11-29-10 and my doctor told me my colon was black due to use of clease more. The Rhubarb is what causes the cell damage....Please beware of this if you take this product. My doctor put me on a high fiber diet and told me to take Metamucil. My colon with go back to normal in time with a proper diet</li>
    <li> Gentle and effective, it doesn&#x27;t give any abdominal pain just a sensation that it is time to go.</li>
    <li> Considering I have stomach issues, these work well for me.  If you use them too much, you enter into colon blow.  You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> I started this product 2 days ago and have no known allergies. I had blood in my urine this morning and painful urination. My friend also started product at same time and also had blood in urine and stomach cramping. After researching Ingredients, I found that rhubarb is linked to allergies due to toxins in leaves and stems and many cannot tolerate the toxicity of anthroquinolones. It is also is super high in oxilates which can cause kidney problems, stones as well as  blood in urine. Product should have clear warning label. this scared us both and we have since discontinued product.</li>
    <li> Works well without pain</li>
    <li> I could not live without this product. I have used it for years. Chronic issues dictate that I need daily help and this works better than anything I have ever tried. It is not a laxative but a natural combination of herbs that lets your body do the work.</li>
    <li> After a co-worker recommended this to me, I was ready to try Cleanse More.  It is so easy to take and so easy on your system.  This product has a permanent place in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> If you need something to help you eliminate a bowel, this is your product, I take it at night and by morning or before lunch I will have a bowel movement.  Wish price was a bit lower.</li>
    <li> Fantastic service and great product</li>
    <li> Great product no abdominal pains.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me about this cleanse, I had tried so many other that didn&#x27;t do the job but this one did.</li>
    <li> Cannot live without this!  I have IBS and have since I was a teenager.  I no longer take prescription medications!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Really works!! I swear by this product. I would recommend this product to anyone with a &amp;#34;stubborn&amp;#34; system or just wants a healthy cleanse</li>
    <li> Really does the job.  I take one in am and one in pm every day</li>
    <li> Really works well, cleans you out like it says.</li>
    <li> Reliable, natural and always works. I take 2 when needed ... Usually when traveling my system is off. So I take it early evening and next morning always good results.</li>
