    <li> I have a difficult time trying to find a paste or cream to last all day. This isn&#x27;t it. Sorry.</li>
    <li> only one that doesn&#x27;t taste nasty &amp; give problems with cleaning out of my mouth</li>
    <li> This works well, but I was not expecting trial size for some reason.  But it works quite well. Next time I will order full size.</li>
    <li> it holds my dentures ok, but it is a mess to clean off when I take dentures out.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing my lower denture for around 5 years. I have tried numerous creams and powders. I like Poligrip, but I found another product held my teeth in better. I like the fact that there is hardly any taste to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the tip. It is too large for my small denture. I always have to use something to smooth the cream down so it doesn&#x27;t get into my mouth or on my tongue, which is almost impossible to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poligrip does not have the staying power I like. I can put it in, and within the time I have eaten one meal, my denture is already coming loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major positive is that there is no zinc in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the trial size better than the large size. The tip is easier to insert into my denture. I also liked being able to carry it with me when I went places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think, when it comes to denture adhesives, it is a preference. So I really cannot recommend or not recommend buying this, although, I do think it is a good product and will meet the need.</li>

    <li> Crystal clear instead of that awful pink color!&lt;br /&gt;Of course it&#x27;s gooey &amp;  only sustains 1 meal&lt;br /&gt;\BUT... this POLYGRIP FREE of zinc got&lt;br /&gt;a re-order full size from me!</li>
    <li> You know it doesn&#x27;t look too cool if you can&#x27;t chew you dinner!  Well, thanks to  &amp;#34;3 Little Women&amp;#34; my dentures allow me to appreciate ALL the wonderful items presented for my meals.</li>
