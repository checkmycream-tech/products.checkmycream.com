    <li> Well worth the money and less expensive than one pays in a store for the same brand!</li>
    <li> Once again an excellent product.  Thank y our Amazon.com for selling g it.. I love it.</li>
    <li> Beats all gas perm cleaning systems. - Easy to use and 20 sec cleaning.. Avoids the need to use enzymes all the time.</li>
    <li> This brand was recommended by my eye doctor at VA rather than another well known brand.  She said I had dry eye.  Expiration date was 14 months after the date that I received them.  I use them 3 times a day so I needed the 4 pack.  The drops definitely make my eyes feel better during the day. Very fast delivery.  I will order this item again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Visine when my eyes were tired and dried from my contacts. I couldn&#x27;t fathom paying for Refresh at Walmart when a small bottle would cost around $7.00. Why purchase that when you could pick up a bottle of Visine for half that price. For people who wear contacts you should definitely try \\&quot;lubricating eye drops\\&quot;. It&#x27;ll help moisturize your eyes and return them to a more natural feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I digress from the main point of the review. For the price and the amount of product you get this is a great purchase. Having 4 bottles is extremely helpful.. leaving one at home, work, and the car makes it that much more flexible</li>
    <li> I have Sorensen&#x27;s Disease, which causes dry mouth and eyes.  The tear duct plugs did not work for me so I&#x27;ve had to find another solution.  A lot of nights, when I need to get up, I have to put these drops in my eyes before I can even open them because my eyes feel so dry and gritty inside.  The drops are nice if you don&#x27;t want a film over your eyes, which can interfere with watching TV or reading, or if you just need a quick convenient fix.  If I know I&#x27;ll be sleeping, I use the Refresh Tears in the gel form, which seems to last a bit longer.  I tried many brands of eye drops before finally settling on the Refresh Tears.  I asked the pharmacist which drops were best for dry eyes, and he said these were about as good as any you could get - so far they have worked well for me and I will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> The headline says it all.  Effective eye moisturizer for dry eyes and american made.  Generic equivalents seem to work well and cost less.</li>
    <li> I use these drops about 3 times a day after receiving a sample from my opthomologist. I have macular degenaration and was advised to use them as often as needed. They are very refreshing and help clear my vision somewhat, especially in smokey places. They also keep my eyes lubricated. It&#x27;s been just a little over a year since I started using them and find them to be the best product of their kind on the market. I bought them at my local pharmacy at first but paid as much for 2 bottles. Here, I receive 4, enough to leave one when I&#x27;m staying at my kids and carry one in my purse at all times. An excellent buy if you rely on eye drops, and an excellent produst!</li>
    <li> I took some medication for acne back in the 1980&#x27;s, and one of its side effects was a reduction of tear production, so I need to use eye drops every day. These eye drops never burn, and always bring relief from dryness. I also have 3 cats, so I frequently get cat hairs in my eyes, and use this to wash them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again, as long as the price is about equal to Sam&#x27;s Club pricing.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  As expected.</li>
    <li> I have to use eye lubrication several times a day.  My eye doctor recommended Refresh Tears and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been happily using.  It gives instant relief to dry eyes.  This 4-pack, at least when I bought it here at Amazon from a 3rd-party, was a real bargain compared to the price I was paying at my local drug store.  The expiration date is 7 months from my purchase date, so no problem there.</li>
    <li> Excellent price. Eye doctor recommended I use these as often as I thought about them during the day for dry eye and to enhance clarity of my vision and it works!</li>
    <li> We use Refresh Tears a lot. It is a good product to keep on hand especially during the dry winter months. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great purchase experience</li>
    <li> seems to refresh eyes well, but I believe that a lubricating drop is better</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Item as promised. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Good value and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This has been a life saverf for me since my eyes get so dry that the optometrist mentioned that I should buy this brand! The best part is that they are for sensitive eyes and help allergies!</li>
    <li> I have been buying refresh tears for years and it does the job. Everything about the products works as advertised.</li>
    <li> The other brands did not work as well in removing the sting in my eyes. This winter, I just had to try something else. A friend recommended Refresh and the difference was night and day. I remember buying at CVS for $14.95 a bottle. Amazon price comes down to $6 per bottle. Thanks, Refresh and thanks, Amazon.</li>
