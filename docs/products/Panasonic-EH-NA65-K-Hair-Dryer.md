<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is more expensive than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It was worth every penny. I have shoulder length hair that is naturally curly and very frizzy. My hair normally takes forever to dry. This dryer cuts my drying down down by at least half and makes my hair shiny and smooth. I still run a straightener over it when I&amp;#34;m done but this styling tool is amazing. I am so happy with this purchase. As a working mom with two toddlers ever second counts in the morning. I had been just wearing my hair back as I didn&#x27; t have time to deal with it. With this dryer I can style my hair like a normal person in minimal time. Worth the splurge.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to think that an expensive hair dryer could be better than my basic, cheapie Conair I had been using, but it totally works!  It&#x27;s alot heavier than I thought it would be but you don&#x27;t have to hold it as long because my hair actually dried faster.  I got lured in by the coupon but it was still alot to spend.  My hair was healthier, indeed shinier and less frizzy after blow-drying.  I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to use all the nozzle attachments and when to use which for what, but I&#x27;m still experimenting.</li>
    <li> my hair dried fast without frizz.  I highly recommend this dryer</li>
    <li> Hair dries faster than other blow dryers, but very bulky and heavy. Love the two-tone colors.</li>
    <li> I am not one to buy an expensive hair dryer, but this Panasonic with Nanoe technology is worth every penny.  The quality is self-evident when you open the package and pull out this professional sized hairdryer.  Although it looks like it would weigh a lot, it is surprisingly light and easy to handle. The controls are simple on the handle, with one side of the switch for temperature, cool, warm, and hot.  The other switch is for high or low air flow, yielding 6 possible combinations.  The \\&quot;Nanoe\\&quot; comes with three nozzles, which slip onto the front of the dryer.  The Set Nozzle for precise styling, the Quick-dry nozzle for drying hair quickly and the Diffuser for creating full bodied hair with volume and styling.  The is also a \\&quot;Cool Shot\\&quot; button on the handle to temporarily turn of the heat, to allow time to style.  The dryer comes with a heavy duty 9 foot cord with a safety overheating/reset plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic has Nanoe technology, which takes moisture from the air and your hair and puts moisture rich particles, small enough to penetrate your hair shafts.  That&#x27;s quite a mouthful.  What it did for my hair was make it soft and silky, and I can see nuances in the color which I didn&#x27;t notice before.  The blonde is blonder, the brown is richer.  My hair dried quickly and quietly, none of the loud buzzing in my ear.  As I run my fingers through my hair, there is none of that dry, frizzy, overblown feeling with my lower priced dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For results like this, you need to make an appointment at a salon.  If this is in your budget, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Yes...I spent $130 on a hair dryer... but it was worth every penny! My hair has never felt so soft and looked so shinny! No more $30 hair dryers that crap out on me after 1 year! No more 25 minute sessions of drying my hair while sweating after I get out of the shower. It only takes me about 7 minutes to dry my very thick long hair on the warm/high setting. It makes me happy to run my fingers through my hair and not think of straw! We shall see how long this one lasts. So far so good : )</li>
    <li> I am fairly particular about hair dryers and I&#x27;m not one that thinks if it dries your hair, then it does the job. Just as there are different shampoos, conditioners and styling products for different hair types, different styling appliances will suit different hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I went in search of a new hair dryer, I had to try several before I found one that I loved. My budget was significantly less than the cost of this Panasonic Smooth &amp; Shiny Nanaoe hair dryer. If you are looking in the $50 and under category stop looking and buy a Remington Pearl Ceramic hair dryer, they are great. If, however, your budget allows for more...this Panasonic with Nanoe technology is pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of thick, wavy / curly hair. My hair has tight curls in the underneath layers and they gradually relax and become just loose waves as they get to the topmost layers. It&#x27;s rather an uneven pattern and for that reason, I take the time to blow my hair straight most of the time. This is a time consuming task that requires a lot of brush work.  It involves using a large round brush and wrapping your hair around the brush, pulling the hair straight as you slide the brush downward as you unroll the hair from the brush, then re-rolling and repeating 3-4 times per section. The last step is to repeat the roll and pull technique while using the cool shot button. This is the secret to getting your style to last and to stay smooth. The cool air allows the hair cuticle to flatten back down after being opened up with the heat from the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as I said it&#x27;s time consuming. The Panasonic Smooth &amp; Shiny dryer cuts my dry time by about 20%. It delivers unbelievable shine and silky soft hair when drying on the high heat setting and finishing off with the cool shot. I used it on my daughter and got great results as well. She has lots of fine, straight hair. I couldn&#x27;t say what the results might be for thin heads of hair though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mostpleasant surprise was when I decided to use the diffuser to see what I could do when I let my hair dry without straightening it. My old standby (the Remington) doesn&#x27;t produce stellar results with the diffuser. The Panasonic, however, made my hair look great. I get nice, smooth and shiny curls. No frizz and fuzz! This additional benefit is what makes the Panasonic such a phenomenal, versatile styling tool for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is noticeably quieter than other dryers I have used (but, keep in mind it is a hair dryer so it&#x27;s not going to be silent). The professional length 9&#x27; cord is much better than standard 6&#x27; cord length on less expensive models. The Panasonic is fairly lightweight too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want hair that looks like you just left the salon, the Panasonic Smooth and Shiny is for you.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is fantastic! I have thick curly, long hair (almost all the way down my back) and it takes about 4-6 hours to air dry my hair. I hate hair dryers though because they make my hair brittle and dry. This one does not do that -- in fact, y hair looks shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to operate.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does a wonderful job.  My hair comes out shiny and, with the diffuser that is included, I can maintain the curls and waves that are natural to my hair.  The nozzle can be set for precision when drying and there is a cool shot button in case the air feels too hot.  Three temperature settings make this dryer versatile and useful for wet or damp hair.  There is also a quick-dry nozzle attachment that disperses air throughout the head and makes drying very quick.  I would only recommend this if you are in a  rush because I found my hair duller looking when I used this attachment.  However, there are days when a quick dry comes in very handy.  The hair dryer&#x27;s description says that it utilizes ions in the air to maintain moisture in your hair.  Whatever method it uses, it really works and is the nicest dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> So, I got this in hopes that it would inspire me to completely blow out my hair.  Looks great when the hairdresser does it but I get bored about halfway through.  The jury is still out- three neat attachments that I have never in my life used and more options than I know what to do with- cool, warm hot and then high and low, and finally a cold burst....I&#x27;m used to just on or off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a little top heavy so not the most comfortable.  But so far so good.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have a ton of hair, and while this is a really nice blow dryer, if you&#x27;re a guy with short hair, it&#x27;s pretty extravagant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and daughter, on the other hand, noticed a huge difference. My daughter isn&#x27;t a huge fan of getting her hair dryed, and happily, this dryer reduces the torture time exponentially. I want to say the difference is in the diffuser, but there&#x27;s more going on here. It isn&#x27;t quite &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; part is probably with my wife&#x27;s naturally curly hair. During the winter months, there&#x27;s been some investment in products that control frizz, and I&#x27;ve been able to casually tell a difference between products. With this hair dryer, though, you&#x27;d swear some really expensive salon-grade stuff was used. The results are pretty surprising, and seem to last. I&#x27;d almost go as far as saying that this could save money, by reducing (or eliminating) the need for control products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was positive there was no way this hair dryer would be worth the money, but seeing how well it works with everyone in the family, I&#x27;d totally recommend it to anyone with curly hair, or who can&#x27;t tolerate much time under the dryer.</li>
    <li> My hair normally takes forever to dry, but not with this dryer. It  drys so quickly and will NOT dry out your hair. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I tend to be critical of items I purchase - I work hard for the money to buy them. This is something I was very pleased with and am glad to have taken a chance. Many reviews mentioned a plastic or bad odor. I can be sensitive to such odors, so I almost didn&#x27;t buy it. I did notice an initial odor, just like you would notice with a new mattress or rug. However even after one use it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing though is that it works as advertised. I have thin, color treated (every 3 weeks) hair. It&#x27;s oily and needs to be washed daily. I have thin hair but a lot of it. I wear it long, and it&#x27;s important to me to look professional and well put together while at work (well, all the time, really).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My entire life, since reaching an age where color treating is a continual process, I have suffered from fly away, brassy, dry looking ends, and general brittleness. I have tried every hair care product known to man in an effort to tame the frizziness - even tried not washing daily as my hairdresser recommended, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use my hair looks better, much better, significantly better - and I didn&#x27;t have a bad hair dryer before. It looks better than having returned from the salon. It looks like it did after I got the keratin treatment done once on a lark, but didn&#x27;t want to continue due to the chemical exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor was there, that&#x27;s true, but like I said it dissipated for me and just didn&#x27;t seem like enough to be worried about. I have never gotten my hair this glossy and nice looking, especially the layers towards the end where it&#x27;s 8-12 inches long and has been chemically treated 16 times. I wish I had found it sooner and recommend it to anyone with my hair type (thin, but abundant, and oily/limp without washing and blowdrying daily.</li>
    <li> The Nano technology is great. Blow dry is much faster than regular product. Keep my hair style nice (no dryness).</li>
    <li> Cut down drying time and made my hair shiny!</li>
    <li> Love it. My hair is not as dry anymore and it does not fall much any more!</li>
    <li> Looks great, works great, love the attachments.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase. If your hairs are wet and messy, the dryer makes them quick and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> This works great! I have very thick hair and this cuts my drying time down to less than 10 minutes. My hair also looks shinier and feels softer. This dryer had some of the best reviews and I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to like this...mostly because it is expensive. I am the type that buys whatever hairdryer is cheapest. I figured hot air is hot air, right? It turns out that is not really the only consideration!!! My old dryer was loud...I mean my vacuum makes less noise. And it seemed to take forever to dry my hair. When I opened this one, honestly it looked a little futuristic, but not much different from my other hair dryers. I figured it was just some gimmick with the  &amp;#34;nanoe&amp;#34; thing and it would make absolutely no difference. I did read that it is supposed to break the water droplets in your hair into smaller droplets, making them easier to dissipate/dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, and the first thing that struck me was how quiet it was. Now, it isn&#x27;t silent, but I could still hear my telephone ringing and didn&#x27;t annoy people in the next room with high-pitched squealing. It did take about 30% less time to dry my hair! I was happy!! I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to dry your hair completely...but I like to use those steam rollers on my hair and they don&#x27;t work with damp ends. I was VERY happy at how this dried my hair, especially the ends which I seemed to have to really waste time on before. Now my hair is long and fine so I can&#x27;t really say how it would fare on someone with thick hair...but if it was faster on mine, it seems it would be faster for any hair. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to really judge if it improves my texture. My hair is pretty smooth to begin with, so I don&#x27;t have far to go. But at the very least, the speed of drying puts less time with heat/air on it which alone has to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to admit it, but maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been using such cheap tools all those years. It really does make hair drying task more speedy and pleasurable.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does!  I have less static in my hair, which I LOVE.  It also seems softer.  I love this dryer.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this dryer. Works really well for my curly hair. I had a really nice/pricey dryer, similar to this one, for years and when it gave out I bought a dept store $30 dryer. I noticed immediately that my hair was getting frizzy. I used that for several months and then finally decided to break down and shell out the cash for this dryer. So glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use it with the curl diffuser on warm heat. I get great curls and less frizz. On occasion I use the directional attachment to straighten my bangs or all of my hair and I love that too. Makes my hair silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I bathed my dog I used the other nozzle that is supposed to be &amp;#34;quick dry.&amp;#34; That was really amazing. Dried my little dog in no time. I was happy and she seemed to be relieved. I imagine that if you don&#x27;t need to worry about frizz, this quick dry nozzle would be great if you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for several weeks and I would recommend it. Hoping this one lasts quite a while!</li>
    <li> Dries nicely, not too loud. I don&#x27;t know if I really notice the Nanoe feature&#x27;s effects compared to my old hair dryer, but I would still buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works very well, a bit pricy but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Replacement for a broken model</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but this thing is fantastic. I was amazed when I blow dryer my hair and it was actually softer. The price may seem steep, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Ok this took about 10 ;minutes off the drying time of my hair as opposed to  using just a regular ionic hair dryer, but not ony that it leaves my hair (which isa bit past  shoulder legnth color treated grey hair with some slight curl) smooth and un frizzy.  I could actually dry it and wear it with out hot curlers or a flat iron, though I still prefer to use a flat iron for extra shine. I never believed that one hair dryer was much better than another but this one sure is. It is an investment in me and I am so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This really works.  I&#x27;ve tried several ceramic, ionic dryers in the past few years and I saw absolutely no difference in how my fine ,&amp;#34; prone to frizz in humidity&amp;#34; hair came out after blowing it dry.  With my new Panasonic, my hair looks smoother, less frizzy and stays that way during the day. For me, this is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I have very curly, frizzy hair and this product has been a dream come true! I have had difficulty finding a blow dryer works on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried cheap ones before and I decided to splurge and get this one I was not disappointed. It is totally worth the money. The attachments it comes with are very helpful depending on how you need to use the hair dryer. I would highly recommend and would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom.  She loves it because it helps prevent her hair from getting frizzy.</li>
    <li> My Wife Really Likes This Dryer, We Would Like Panasonic Extended Warranty!</li>
    <li> love, love, love this dryer! It has cut the drying time for my hair in half!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair dryer, a Conair mini, for ages--more than 10 years.  The Conair has only two setting (high and low) and did not come with any accessories.  So going from the Conair to the Panasonic Nanoe was like upgrading from a basic to a state-of -the-art hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic Nanoe comes with a quick-dry nozzle, a set nozzle and a diffuser. It boasts 3 temperatures settings--hot, warm and cool, and a choice of strong (high) or gentle (low) airflow.  What makes this hair dryer special is that it produces nanoe or invisible water particles that cling to your hair as you dry it.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that reaches to my shoulders and when I used the Panasonic, I had the impression that strands of hair were \\&quot;separated.\\&quot; It boosted my hair&#x27;s natural volume and gave it more movement. And my hair felt softer too after I used the Panasonic with the quick-dry nozzle and the diffuser.  My sister who has long fine hair also agreed that this dryer seemed to give her hair more volume too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been handling a mini dryer for years, it took a bit of time to get used to the full-sized Panasonic. At first it felt heavy, especially when I attached the diffuser to it, and therefore was somewhat awkward to manage.  However, I&#x27;m getting used to its weight and size and therefore doing a better job at styling my hair with it.  The Panasonic Nanoe does emit a smell, but according to the operating instructions booklet, it is normal and harmless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this hair dryer. I like having the different temperature settings, especially the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; one because I want to avoid heat damage.  With my old dryer, I didn&#x27;t have any other choice but hot.  After using an attachment with the hot setting, it may be warm to the touch so handle with care if you need to switch nozzles.  This is a great hair dryer. I don&#x27;t quite understand the fine details behind the Nanoe technology, but these invisible particles certainly make my hair look good.</li>
    <li> Ionizer works as advertised. Lacks blower power, Durability will remain unknown for a few years.</li>
    <li> It really makes your hair softer and smoother. Now I do not even need to use hair conditioner everyday....A must if you have long hair and wash it everyday...</li>
    <li> I have long hair, that is about half way down my back.  I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of blow dryers and used to just let my hair air dry.  Lately my hair is wavier than it used to be if I air dry it, so it doesn&#x27;t look as nice, and I&#x27;ve started blowing it dry most times I wash it.  Previously, I&#x27;ve only purchased a couple of hair dryers, and I don&#x27;t think I spent much money on them.  I have been dealing with some flyaways lately too so when my previous blow dryer quit on me, I did a little research before buying a new one.  I never anticipated spending this much money on a blow dryer.  I mean, aren&#x27;t they all the same?  I soon learned that the answer is NO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is still a fairly new product, so there were not a lot of reviews to go by.  I did research on what to look for in a hair dryer.  It was pretty easy to decide that negative ions are a good thing when buying a hair dryer.  Tourmaline? Ceramic? Well, ok, but what about nanoe?  It seems that Panasonic is the only one using this technology right now.  Infuses 1000x more moisture into hair than typical ion hair dryers?  I was definitely skeptical when I read that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that I definitely wanted separate controls for speed and heat, and the Panasonic EH-NA65-K has that.  I was also hoping to find a hair dryer that came with a couple of attachments.  The nozzle for my last hair dryer would come off sometime when I was using the hair dryer because it just slipped over the end of the dryer.  The Panasonic comes with 3 different attachments that snap into place and can be turned to whatever orientation you are looking for.  They are nice attachments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said before, there were only a few reviews out there, but what was there was nothing but great reviews.  What the heck, I decided to give it a try and I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased.  This hair dryer is quite a bit quieter than my previous one.  I also really noticed how much I am used to the quietness of this the last time I got a hair cut and the salon used a regular dryer to dry my hair.  It was way louder.  This also dries my hair much quicker, which is really nice.  With the amount of hair I have, it takes a while to dry.  Most of the time I am using the quick dry nozzle.  I also found that I didn&#x27;t need to brush my hair while using this hair dryer.  I just dry it free style and my hair looks good and straight when I&#x27;m done.  As for the flyaways, it didn&#x27;t completely solve that problem, but it does seem to make that better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this hair dryer the first time, I thought my hair looked a little darker than normal, and figured that my mind must just be playing tricks on me since I know this is supposed to infuse moisture in my hair.  The next day, one of my coworkers asked me if I did something different to my hair.  I asked why they asked and they said my hair looked a little different color than normal.  I have natural red hair and have never dyed my hair before.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  I didn&#x27;t tell anyone that i was getting a new hair dryer.  That told me that what I noticed must have been true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, I am very happy with my new hair dryer.  It hurt to spend this much money at first, but now I think it was well worth the cost.  Now I just wish that Panasonic would come out with a travel size nanoe hair dryer.  This hair dryer is a little larger than a regular one, due to the nanoe port on the top.  Between that and just the weight of it being a full size hair dryer, I don&#x27;t really want to take it with me when I travel.  I travel for business about once a month a really miss this hair dryer when I&#x27;m gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic, please make a Travel Nanoe Hair Dryer!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to balk at the price of this hair dryer, but like most things it&#x27;s relative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a professional style dryer, not unlike those you will see in professional salons, and if you use a dryer at home, or dry your hair often - then this would be a good investment for that &amp;#34;one good dryer&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having daughters at home, and my lovely wife who has shoulder length hair means we have several dryers laying around the house, and I would say straight away, most are pretty lame.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t completely subscribe to the advertising blarb on this Nanoe Technology, but you cannot argue with consistent result. This is the first dryer I&#x27;ve seem that gets your hair dry, without drying it out - if that makes sense?&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels soft and manageable, easy to comb through and as much as I hate to use the word &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty quiet, has separate heat and power buttons and attachment accessories including a diffuser for different effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again, view this dryer for what it is, as in the equivalent to one or two trips to the salon, for something you get to keep and use at home. Thus far everyone who&#x27;s used it in my house has been impressed. 5 stars</li>
    <li> This seems like a great hair dryer, just not for my hair type. It definitely seems to put moisture into the hair. Unfortunately, I have curly hair which I blow dry straight. It seemed that there was so much moisture in my hair that it started to curl up after a short time, even worse if it was a humid day. If you have dry hair I think you would love this dryer. Also, it is a bit large and heavy, a bit difficult for me to use.</li>
    <li> I was definitely skeptical of the claims of this dryer&#x27;s nanoe technology. But surprisingly, my hair feels smoother and more conditioned than normal (as if I used extra conditioner or just done a treatment). The dryer dries quickly with strong blast without being too noisy. It looks sleek and, despite the size, doesn&#x27;t feel overly heavy. The weight is well balanced. The cold blast feature works as expected. The issues I had was with the sliding button controls which can be a little stiff. Also, I have straight, moderately thick hair and the &#x27;conditioning&#x27; effect sometimes flatten my hair. Hair can feel too soft that there&#x27;s not enough &#x27;lift&#x27; and bounce. This is great when hair is brittle and frizzy. Not so great on humid days. Curly hair may not have this issue. So far, the biggest drawback is definitely the price.</li>
    <li> Very nice hairdryer. Wishing the size is smaller though.</li>
    <li> I always thought a blow dryer was a blow dryer and they all did the same thing.  Boy was I wrong about this hair dryer.  It is not the same as all the others.  I have straight, thick hair and have a hard time getting volume due to the weight of my hair making it lay flat.  I do blow dry my hair to give it some volume but it usually doesn&#x27;t last long.  But with the Panasonic hair dryer, I get so much volume! It is amazing!  I don&#x27;t know if it is due to the moisture being put back into the hair but my hair looks great and others have told me the same thing.  My hair also seems to hold the volume almost all day long which is unusual for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the dryer took a little bit of getting used to as it is a bit bulky, but it is light weight.  After a few days I got the hang of it and now I am getting the most out of the dryer.  Several heat setting make blow drying easy to get the results that you want.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I tested this hair dryer against two older models we have. One was a Conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer. The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn&#x27;t use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren&#x27;t as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you&#x27;ll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can&#x27;t stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they&#x27;re wonderful. If so, you&#x27;ll think this dryer is to die for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I&#x27;m concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don&#x27;t forget to use the best of older technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it. After more than a year, the bad plastic smell is almost gone.der technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.  Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it. After more than a year, the bad plastic smell is almost gone.</li>
    <li> Awesome dryer! I was on the fence for a while but now I&#x27;m addicted. Leaves my fine, fizzy, dry hair soft and smooth and my hair just keeps getting healthier. If you are waiting, don&#x27;t...you just have to try this once and you will be sold!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has been amazing. I have very curly hair that is sensitive to heat and I found that this hair dryer does not dry my hair out. I am a sceptic at heart and have been disappointed by many dryers but I have to confess than after a few months of use it has improved my hair. I do find that my curls are less frizzy and do not tend to dry out as much thoughtout the day. I have never found drying my hair an enjoyable experience until now. This dryer is not cheap but not the most expensive either and well worth the price. I will be buying the flat iron in the future!</li>
    <li> Well worth the money! I&#x27;m growing super long hair and this makes my hair so soft and shiny! I should have discovered this earlier!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice hair dryer. Dries hair good. Has different options to chose wether you want to dry it with cold, warm or hot air. During my life I had different kind of hair dryers, and this one is as good as my other ones. Did not really noticed the difference. But it does what any hair drier suppose to do. And yes, it&#x27;s made in Thailand.</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking hair dryer that works fast. My hair usually frizzes out when I blow dry it, but not with this. My hair did not feel dried out at all after using this. The blow dryer has hot, warm and cool settings with a cool blast button. The back opens easily, so that any dust buildup can be removed. The weight is a bit heavy, but the design makes it nice to hold. I took off one star because the diffuser did not do a great job on my wimpy curls, but the other attachments worked out well for me. The color is nice, but if it came in green, that would be even better. The best blow dryer I have used so far.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer, but as hard as I&#x27;ve tried to figure out why it&#x27;s a $130 hair dryer, I just can&#x27;t find the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty short hair and don&#x27;t use a dryer that often, so I admit that I&#x27;m not the target market. But my wife has very thick long hair and uses a blow dryer every time she washes her hair. I&#x27;ve kept a close eye on her hair since she started using this dryer and I can&#x27;t detect any difference either. So I asked her directly, would you pay $130 for this? No, she wouldn&#x27;t. She said that it&#x27;s not much different than her $40 dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that there are two independent controls: temp and air speed. That&#x27;s nice. I also like the fact that you can override the heat and blast cold air on demand. That&#x27;s a great touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as far as the moisturizing and conditioning aspects, I can&#x27;t detect them at all. I&#x27;m not typically such a skeptic, but when a product costs substantially more than the everyday version that I&#x27;ve been using for years, I need to somehow be convinced and wowed that the product is really worth paying so much more. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t wowed by this dryer.</li>
    <li> I gave my daughter, a hair stylist, this Panasonic hair dryer to try out.  She liked it so much that she took it to work and replaced her other dryer with this one.  She told me that no matter what hair type she worked on, this hair dryer made the client&#x27;s hair look fuller, and silky.  Maybe it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;nanoe technology&amp;#34; that makes the difference.  She also liked the extra long cord (9 ft).  The only negative thing was that it&#x27;s a little on the heavy side for home use, although professional hair dryers tend to be that way.  Imported from Thailand.</li>
    <li> This is the highest quality blow dryer that I&#x27;ve ever owned. It does a fabulous job and my hair feels softer and shinier</li>
    <li> I admit I was a bit skeptical about the nanoe hype. I have had several friends tell me they would never use anything else again. But I actually did notice a difference. I have thick, curly hair, and I switch back and forth from curly to straight. Using the diffuser attachment to style curls really did seem to give me less frizz throughout the day than my last cheap hair dryer. The curls just look softer. I have used both the quick dry nozzle and the set nozzle to blow dry my hair straight. My hair dries faster, and I can see the extra moisture. I have even started skipping my usual last step of a quick once-over with a straightening iron. The extra moisture has not seemed to affect how long my hair stays straight, either. The blow dryer has settings to adjust air flow and temperature, and it has a cool shot button (great for setting your style at the end!). It is a bit bulky, but surprisingly lightweight for its size. The only tiny little thing I miss with this dryer is a retractable cord. The 9-foot cord is convenient, but a bit of a pain to store. Overall, this is a great dryer that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews. Maybe I got a melon? This didn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster or better then my cheap $30 Revlon dryer and I have thin hair. It just made me sick with the plastic fumes it emitted. I returned this immediately.</li>
    <li> I have straight thick hair and my old hair dryers would leave it frizzy until I slept on it. However when I tried it with this blowdryer, even at the fast dry attachment, it was smooth and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have a digital perm, I can use the diffuser. I put half of my hair twisted, sectioned into thirds and put it on the diffuser! It works wonderful so far. I&#x27;m so happy with this blow dryer. Worth the price. First expensive blow dryer I have owned. Now I can have nice waves.</li>
    <li> As usual I have my wife test out the hair dryers as she is the one with the hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the design is beautiful. She thinks the dryer is ugly. She said it&#x27;s a high quality dryer, but overall she prefers our John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer (which costs something like 75% less than this model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has thin hair which is easily damaged. She sees absolutely not difference with the &amp;#34;Nanoe Technology&amp;#34;. The ionizing and &amp;#34;moisture-rich nanoe particles&amp;#34; were dismissed by her as a marketing ploy. I&#x27;m not sure about that but will say that at the very least mileage will vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife DOES like the power, and the separate speed and temperature controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion? If you have the money and like the design it&#x27;s a well-built and very functional dryer. If you just want a good reliable dryer you can find good ones for far cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about \\&quot;new, amazing, breakthrough\\&quot; technology in beauty products.  I certainly believe there are different levels of quality and also that one product may perform better or worse on different people.  So I was hoping this dryer would make a difference, while being prepared for less than spectactular results.  So drum roll please...I personally thought my hair looked silkier, shinier and it did dry noticeably faster, but the shocker was that other people really noticed the difference!&lt;br /&gt;My adult daughters to whom I am often apparently invisible, both asked me individually and on seperate occassions if I had just had my hair done, and what had I done differently etc.  Ironically, the evening that I had in fact come straight from the salon (and prior to using this product) warranted no notice.  I&#x27;ve had others compliment my hair as well.  I&#x27;m giving more weight to those who see me all the time and tend not to use flattery to judge that there was a very noticable difference.&lt;br /&gt;  The other thing worth mentioning is that in my youth my hair was one of my best assests in terms of appearance.  For the past 10 years or so, its become a definite liability.  I joke that it&#x27;s a fire hazard and I&#x27;m not allowed near open flame as it is so dry and so covered in product that its quite flammable.  I put a fair bit of effort into getting it to be healthier and less frizzy and I&#x27;ve actually had people ask me if I&#x27;ve ever tried a \\&quot;really good\\&quot; conditioner or anti-frizz product.  After what I hope is a chilling gaze I let them know I do believe I have tried nearly all conditioners/styling products. So it is a rare thing indeed for me to rave about a hair product or in this case hair dryer and I must give it a rave review!&lt;br /&gt;  If you possess beautiful, soft, smooth heathly hair this may not be worth the money,  but if like me you color frequently and have those weird coarse alien hairs springing up randomly then I would say go for it!</li>
    <li> Really makes my hair smooth and shiny! I use this along with chi serum..</li>
    <li> My superhero boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas and picked it out ALL BY HIMSELF! I&#x27;m having a proud girlfriend moment here. Anyways...I&#x27;ve never had an expensive hair dryer, I&#x27;ve always used a hair dryer that didn&#x27;t cost me more than 15 bucks and used it until it burst into flames. NEVER AGAIN. This hair dryer is the most amazing thing ever. I have color treated and extremely damaged hair. NEVER has my hair felt so silky smooth after using this product. It&#x27;s much quieter than my previous beast. The only issue I have is that its heavier than what I was used too, which isn&#x27;t to say anything negative about the product, more so that I need to go to the gym more often. This is an amazing hair dryer and I absolutely can&#x27;t get enough of it. I hope this was useful.</li>
    <li> I was hesitating to purchase such an expensive hair dryer. But it was well worth it. After drying your hair,  it was really shiny and smooth. Hair was static free, no messy at all. Someone mentioned a funny smell, it was gone after the first use. I bought it on Ebay and saved extra $20. Highly recommended it! No regrets. One thing to mention is that nano works well when the air is a little moisture. I use it in bathroom immediately after taking a shower.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, A++++++++++</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.  No more frizz for me!</li>
    <li> Works great. My wife really liked it for Mother&#x27;s Day. Its dries her hair faster than her old one.</li>
    <li> Love it. Have very long thick hair. Cut drying time almost in half. Did not frizz my hair as other dryers have in the past.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Not as heavy or as cumbersome to hold while drying hair. It is however, a large hairdryer and not compact for travel purposes. Doesn&#x27;t dry&lt;br /&gt;( frizz) my hair as much as non- ionic dyers. Love all the settings! Several useful attachments were included. You can find a lower price elsewhere without the attachments.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I have ever owned  !!  Lives up to its hype !! Thick hair that takes FOREVER to dry, not anymore. My tired arms thank you.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer, really help to maintain hair shinning and reduce oil. However, it&#x27;s still pricing,because the so-called nanoe tech makes little difference between Panasonic EH-NA65 with Philips HP8203 (sold in China mainland, $30)</li>
    <li> The drying speed is actually no faster than my $20 1350W hair dryer. The &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; head dries even slower than the &amp;#34;precise dry&amp;#34; head. And in my opinion the dryer is HEAVY. But my hair does feel much smoother than before. It does its job to retain the moisture of my hair.</li>
    <li> I was definitely skeptical of paying this much for a hair dryer, especially one with a brand that I have never even heard of making hair dryers.  But the reviews were good so I decided I&#x27;d give it a try. I had really high expectations and they were definitely met! I LOVE this hair dryer. I have wavy/curly hair and usually when I blow dry it, it gets really frizzy, this blow dryer gets rid of at least 75% of that friziness, if not more. And the diffuser it comes with is amazing! Another plus, is that it is soooo much quieter than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
    <li> Panasonic EH-NA65-K is an ergonomic, very well design and made, and aesthetic hair drier, like no other, but at a price.  It is superior to ion ones thanks to its Nanoe technology that much better infuses moisture into hair during drying by making the ionized droplets much smaller. And, it is really working making the dried moist hair looking slightly darker.  However, the substantial Nanoe part sits on the top resulting in the drier&#x27;s full size and weight. The handle is ergonomic and fits well the palm. The speed and heat levels are controlled by separate knobs. 3 different nice attachments snap onto the end preventing slipping over, and can be rotated to a desired orientation. The drier is quiet and quieter than the professional ones. It dries hair unusually fast maybe also, because moisture infused hair seem ready when only separated from each other before feel like straw. No brushing is needed while drying to prevent curling straight hair, and fewer fly away in comparison. Most useful seems the quick dry nozzle.</li>
    <li> I received this Panasonic Smooth &amp; Shiny Hair Dryer with Nanoe Technology, about a week ago and was so impressed with my first use.  After taking it out of the box, my first impression was how well made and what high quality they used in making this hair dryer.  I have had many different brands of hair dryers, ranging in cheaper to expensive ones, over my lifetime and this one blew them all out of the water.  The weight of this dryer is like that of a professional or more expensive brands.  Heavier than the cheaper dryers, but not an arm breaking heavy, as your hair drys much quicker, so you don&#x27;t need to hold it as long.  It has 2 speed settings and 3 heat settings, as well as 3 pro-quality styling attachments.  I have naturally thick, highlighted, below my shoulders length hair and I was so happy with how quickly it dried my hair without drying it out.  It works hand in hand with good shampoo, conditioners and styling products to help keep your hair full, shiny and looking full of life.  I am so grateful to be using this quality product on my hair, to produce many wonderful \\&quot;good hair days\\&quot;.  Thank you Panasonic, for creating a mighty fine hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dryer! I was a bit apprehensive at first because of the price tag but it&#x27;s well worth the money. I have curly, color treated hair and I definitely noticed the difference using this hair dryer verses my old one. My hair feels healthy, smoother...as if I just came back from the salon! Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair dryer . I have a long hair, before I need to spent more than 20 minutes to dry my hair, but after I use this, only 5 minutes is ok, is save time. Actually, after I use it, my hair become healthy.  It looks like more straight . Also, this dryer save my hair, I just lost a litter hair during my washing.</li>
