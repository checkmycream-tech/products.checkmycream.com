      <li>Its a great product if they remember to use it.</li>
      <li>and my face feels great when I wash it.</li>
      <li>Love Amazon!!</li>
      <li>The proactiv is good but what I dont like is the fact that you cannot stop its usage cuz d acne will return.</li>
      <li>It is just a trial size remember but good to see if they will stick with the routine.  </li>
      <li>that does work fairly well, if it wheren&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Maybe this product works best for people with mild acne.</li>
      <li>Outstanding in everyway!</li>
      <li>Sometimes simpler is better!</li>
      <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
      <li>And what&#x27;s best about it is my new skin care (After sun lotion and Moisturizing face wash cream)</li>
      <li>It ended up making me break out more than when I started.  </li>
      <li>Soap and water is better.</li>
      <li>I wish I had paid more attention to the size of the products included in this purchase.</li>
      <li>Sometimes clearing your skin up is not about drying it out but moisturizing it more.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you read the sizes.  </li>
      <li>- there are better deals out there without having to pay over 8 bucks for shipping.</li>
      <li>I called their customer service line to make sure that I would not be automatically billed and shipped more product and told the woman that I ordered through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>And it was honestly the best money I have ever spent.</li>
      <li>Especially if u r an amazon prime customer , perfect</li>
      <li>For the cost of this product it should have worked a ton better.</li>
      <li>I love the Proactiv line.  </li>
      <li>I was better off not using anything at all.</li>
      <li>But love the product, just one use</li>
      <li>But as long as I use it twice or even once a day it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>I have tried this product several times and I have never gotten very good results from it.  </li>
      <li>It was too Strong</li>
      <li>I imagine this product would be great if you have severe acne, but if you are like me, I say save the money and stick with Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to hear that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about being automatically billed and receive any more of their products; however, I was furious that the first representative didn&#x27;t give me that information</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.    </li>
      <li>It is so much more cost effective to buy it via Amazon than direct....</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I have used Proactiv and one thing I learned is that it is very costly to maintain the use of.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even and smooth</li>
      <li>But after using it a while, my skin adjusted and it wasn&#x27;t oily, it felt smooth.</li>
      <li>The benzoyl peroxide that this product relies on can perhaps be replicated by following an online guide, but with one application a day this lasts two months, and I&#x27;m happy to spend $20.00 a month to reduce my acne -</li>
      <li>They are of course different from what many acne treatments contain, and it is their combined use that creates good results.</li>
      <li>Proactive can really dry out your face but great for a week here</li>
      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>The green tea moisturizer is very light and gel like good for acne prone skin.  </li>
      <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone trying to stay on a more natural path to skin care.</li>
      <li>I bought this for someone to try, because I had success with my proactive kit  </li>
      <li>I love my clear skin.</li>
      <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
      <li>I should have stopped using it right there.  </li>
      <li>But none of that occurred and her faced cleared right up.</li>
      <li>It burned th right side of my face.</li>
      <li>I got someone right away and said that I wanted to cancel any pending shipments and gave my address information and also told this gentleman that I ordered through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>this works quickly and very well in clearing up acne.</li>
      <li>My skin became very very flaky and irritated.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
      <li>I follow what the web video says, it makes more sense and pea size for all is not enough.  </li>
      <li>For the first 2 days I thought this might be the product for me.  </li>
      <li>I am 30 years old and think i have tried every acne product available...</li>
      <li>First Time using it</li>
      <li>When I first started using Proactiv, I used the orginal one.  </li>
      <li>That will be better, won&#x27;t it?\\&quot;    Stick with products from your local drugstore, that understand how to treat customers.</li>
      <li>i continued to use and actually ended up with more acne.</li>
      <li>Great product, but the bottles are VERY small for the price they are charging for this kit.</li>
      <li>Acne Free is actually better and costs a whole lot less.</li>
      <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
      <li>While the product seems to work decent, I cannot tell a difference between when I use ProActiv and when I use Clean &amp; Clear products (which are MUCH cheaper!)  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am very happy with the way the product works so far; I struggle with super oily skin, black and whiteheads, and some red bumps.</li>
      <li>This particular 5 piece kit is over priced (Shop around first).</li>
      <li>it really hurt.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter to get her started &amp; it works really well.  </li>
      <li>This product is only available through the mail or online.</li>
      <li>I was really worried about my daughter using this product.</li>
      <li>Bought as a Christmas gift for my niece and she loves proactive, her face is always breaking out, arrived on time, thanks for everything</li>
      <li>You can actually customize your regimen or you can make it simpler by using Acne Free.</li>
      <li>very disapointed</li>
      <li>But never had any real issues with my skin until about a year ago.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s far beyond any other type of washing treatment, but at the same time it&#x27;s not an antibiotic (which really isn&#x27;t good for you) and so its worth it for the results.</li>
      <li>and now I am thinking about going back to the original Proactiv.</li>
      <li>Also a ton of other ingredients most people can&#x27;t even pronounce.</li>
      <li>You can achieve this same effect just by proper cleansing (using a good cleanser, astringent and topical medication).</li>
      <li>I had mild to moderate acne and wanted to get proactiv to keep it under control.</li>
      <li>&quot; allow to dry, apply the \\&quot;Repairing Treatment\\&quot; allow to dry for a while, then apply the moisturizer as needed - probably a good idea since if you&#x27;re using this product you probably have sensitive skin and mine felt by touch</li>
      <li>This is the first product that really clears everything up and does not dry out my face.  </li>
      <li>but you also have to pay their high shipping fee.</li>
      <li>Thought the would be a little  bit more for the money.  </li>
      <li>and I know my skin is staying healthy, not putting harsh chemicals on it.  </li>
      <li>It is most likely just my skin type that reacted so poorly since so many people find it helpful.  </li>
      <li>They catch you with their special offer of half price on your first kit</li>
      <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
      <li>Product was received in new condition and on time.</li>
      <li>and I decided to try the New Advance Proactiv.</li>
      <li>, that means I get a new kit every 4 months</li>
      <li>You can adjust the time you receive your new kit(up to 16 weeks) on the proactive website.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Do NOT use on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.</li>
    <li> The product works well. It is expensive, so not sure I will continue the use of the product. You do have to develop a new routine and use it everyday to see results.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. It is so much more cost effective to buy it via Amazon than direct....Love Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Overall good product. Important to use as directed; if you have sensitive skin, use once daily instead of twice daily. This particular 5 piece kit is over priced (Shop around first). The refining mask is great, it works as advertised. Seller delivery and shipment was excellent.</li>
    <li> Outstanding in everyway!</li>
    <li> The proactiv is good but what I dont like is the fact that you cannot stop its usage cuz d acne will return. So you have to continue to purchase once you&#x27;ve started. But it DOES work!</li>
    <li> I wasted about $50 on Proactive products and I used them as directed but they didn&#x27;t work at all.  It dried out my skin but I still got pimples or other skin problems.  It works for some but not for others.  Sometimes clearing your skin up is not about drying it out but moisturizing it more.  I&#x27;ve been just putting Banana Boat After Sun lotion on my skin after Garnier Fructis Moisturizing face wash and my skin looks great.  It&#x27;s even and smooth and I know my skin is staying healthy, not putting harsh chemicals on it.  And what&#x27;s best about it is my new skin care (After sun lotion and Moisturizing face wash cream) is that it only costs me about $10 every 3 months.  Sometimes simpler is better!</li>
    <li> i have seen proactive work for a friend... but definitly not for me. the second time using (and from that time forward) it made me skin red and irrotated. i read to stop using the toner if that happened, i did. nothing changed. i continued to use and actually ended up with more acne. way to hasrh... although i have to say a prositive about proactive.. the refining mask. that does work fairly well, if it wheren&#x27;t so expensive i&#x27;d atleast buy that, but they want $23 for a small bottle of it. way over priced.</li>
    <li> For the first 2 days I thought this might be the product for me.  It made my skin smoother due to the exfoliating scrub, and it looked as though my acne was less noticeable.  I should have stopped using it right there.  It completely dried out my skin despite the use of moisturizers at night and in the morning.  My skin became very very flaky and irritated.  It ended up making me break out more than when I started.  It is most likely just my skin type that reacted so poorly since so many people find it helpful.  If you have dry or sensitive skin, USE WITH CAUTION!  The other reason that I rated this as a 1 star product was because of ProActiv&#x27;s customer service.  I know that their company has the auto shipment feature so that when you order their products, if you do not cancel, you get an automatic shipment 30, 60, or 90 days later (depending on the size you ordered).  I called their customer service line to make sure that I would not be automatically billed and shipped more product and told the woman that I ordered through Amazon.  She put me on hold for over an hour.  While I was on hold on my landline, I called back in with my cell phone.  I got someone right away and said that I wanted to cancel any pending shipments and gave my address information and also told this gentleman that I ordered through Amazon.  He was a little rude and informed me that since I purchased through a private party and not through them, that I do not have an account with their company and he could not find my address information in their system.  I was pleased to hear that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about being automatically billed and receive any more of their products; however, I was furious that the first representative didn&#x27;t give me that information but instead stuck me on hold for an eternity and though the second rep did give me the information I needed, he did so with a very unpleasant attitude.  I certainly hope this is not the standard when dealing with their customer service forthe sake of other consumers.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister this product is great and it helps your skin (i could see a change on my sisters face) also we order it for her once in the actual proactive website and we didn&#x27;t like that they keep your credit card records and keep sending it unless you say to stop, we actually got a better price in amazon and less hassle</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I have used Proactiv and one thing I learned is that it is very costly to maintain the use of. This product is only available through the mail or online. There is a reason for that. To maximize profits. If you will notice, there are hundreds upon hundreds of infomercials for Proactiv in which people claim that it has helped their acne. Someone has to pay for all those glossy commercials. And, you know what? It&#x27;s you. When you purchase any Proactive product or kit you not only pay for the physical product but you also pay for all those expensive commercials. They catch you with their special offer of half price on your first kit and then you pay the forty bucks a month or so for their kit. To add insult they charge you a shipping fee to have it mailed to you. So you not only pay forty bucks but you also have to pay their high shipping fee. It makes you wonder if Proactiv actually care about people as they make themselves appear to be.  My experience with Proactive has been unimpressive. I have moderate acne and have occasional flare-ups. I got tired of paying the forty bucks a month for a minimal improvement and switched to Acne Free which was available at my local store. I was so happy to have given this product a try and have stuck with it since. Acne Free is actually better and costs a whole lot less. And I can purchase it at a store near so I don&#x27;t have to pay an exorbitent price to have it shipped to me.   In summary, Proactiv is a scam that takes advantage of teens and others who have no idea how to treat their acne. I can see how it does not work for severe acne. It is basically a cleansing regimen that a lot of over the counter products do not utilize. You can achieve this same effect just by proper cleansing (using a good cleanser, astringent and topical medication). You can actually customize your regimen or you can make it simpler by using Acne Free.</li>
    <li> The worst thing you can do to your face ,don&#x27;t even try it&lt;br /&gt;make my wife&#x27;s face worst</li>
    <li> I have pretty standard acne; I am not a pizza face, but I usually have at least one pimple. I had tried ProActiv a long time ago, and decided I&#x27;d try it again now that I am in my 20&#x27;s.  First of all, the containers in this order are  tiny! You have to use a very small amount, which can be difficult.  While the product seems to work decent, I cannot tell a difference between when I use ProActiv and when I use Clean &amp; Clear products (which are MUCH cheaper!)  Also, if I use all the ProActiv products in the way the system says, my skin gets SO dried out.  I imagine this product would be great if you have severe acne, but if you are like me, I say save the money and stick with Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
    <li> I usually use Mary Kay but it hasn&#x27;t been working well, and I got tired of going through someone to buy my products, so I figured I would try Proactiv...I&#x27;ve been using the product for about two weeks and my face feels great when I wash it. Your face will break out for about the first two weeks after that it should start clearing up slowly. Overall, I am very happy with the way the product works so far; I struggle with super oily skin, black and whiteheads, and some red bumps. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is not as oily and my black and whiteheads are starting to clear up. I still have some red bumps but their starting to clear up also. Great product, but the bottles are VERY small for the price they are charging for this kit. Shipping was EXTREMELY slow, so if your in a rush take your chances. I had to stay on the seller to find out where my package was because tracking was never being updated, and the package took way longer than it should have. The seller was very nice and kept me updated on any questions I had, but my only negative is the shipping time and how small the bottles are for the price.</li>
    <li> After using this kit for only one week, I have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin. I didnt really have much acne except a few stray pimples, which were gone in a matter of days. My skin also feels softer and smoother and even my dark spots an disolorations are fading. It burns a little, but nothing serious. I know that this may not work for everybody, but it working well for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Proactiv Solution 5 Piece Kit with Bonus Green Tea moisturizer .33 oz, not 1  oz which was advertised here???? I bought this for someone to try, because I had success with my proactive kit  You have to follow the instructions! But I notice on the website video the doctors say a quarter size amount of renewing cleanser, a dime size amount of the revitalizing toner, and a pea size amount of the repairing treatment, and in the box it says all items use a pea size amount. I follow what the web video says, it makes more sense and pea size for all is not enough.  The refining mask works well at shrinking large pores especially on the nose, I leave on at least 20 minutes, then clean off with a wash cloth. The green tea moisturizer is very light and gel like good for acne prone skin.  I am an active member with proactive solution, that means I get a new kit every 4 months automatically I pay after I receive my kit with a money order, and am registered on their website. You can adjust the time you receive your new kit(up to 16 weeks) on the proactive website. You also get a discount while you are a active member on all their products. You can buy additonal products with a credit card on the website or use the order sheet that comes with the brochure to order with a credit card, check, or money order.  I started using the regular 30 day trial kit like this one. After 30 days, I received the 90 day supply kit which is about $59.00 + 7.99 Shipping and Handling. First Time using it I noticed my skin felt oily, and I have dry skin. But after using it a while, my skin adjusted and it wasn&#x27;t oily, it felt smooth. After almost a year with clear complexion, my skin started to feel dry and irritated. So I changed my regular 3 step kit (on the proactive website)to the renewing cleanser, gentle formula clarifying toner, clarifying night cream, and green tea moisturizer. My skin isn&#x27;t dry or irritated now.   You can change your 3 step regular kit (2.5% benzoyl peroxide) to the gentle formula kit (no benzoyl peroxide, but salicylic acid), or the extra strength kit(7% benzoyl peroxide), or a combination of the 3. But you have to have a least 3 products : cleanser, toner, and an another product to treat acne like the repairing treatment. Up to 5 products are allowed in your kit. You can also get a smaller size like the renewing cleanser 4oz instead of the 6fl oz.   Proactiv solution worked for me, and maybe it will work for you as well.</li>
    <li> I buy it for my teenagers. Its a great product if they remember to use it. Received it on time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter to get her started &amp; it works really well.  She is very happy with it.  It is just a trial size remember but good to see if they will stick with the routine.  Highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had mild to moderate acne and wanted to get proactiv to keep it under control. i used it in the morning and at night. last night after using it before going to bed my skin was burning. it really hurt. today before leaving for work i didn&#x27;t use proactiv just a face wash i had. my face is so dry it&#x27;s horrible. i&#x27;ve used proactiv in the past and didn&#x27;t have this issue. not satisfied one bit, i would like my money back.</li>
    <li> I love the Proactiv line.  I was skeptical because I have senstive skin, but once I tried it I realize I can&#x27;t use anything else.  I stopped a few months ago because the place the mall that I brought it from didn&#x27;t sell it anymore,so I purchased it from amazon andc started touse it again and now my skin is back on track andc I love my clear skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is worse, being left on hold for about half an hour last week by their customer support hotline and eventually giving up!  Or having the line answer by some incompetent yo-yo giving you the third degree (\\&quot;Why did you order it if you were going to decide to return it!\\&quot;)  You will feel you are caught in some nightmare where Alice in Wonderland meets Kafka.    Another great line: \\&quot;If you don&#x27;t like our product, we can send it to you every six months instead of every month.  That will be better, won&#x27;t it?\\&quot;    Stick with products from your local drugstore, that understand how to treat customers.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to return the lastest shipment, THAT I DID NOT AUTHORIZE, and I wanted to ship it by UPS so I once again called Proactive Solutions Customer Service to get an address. I spoke with Kesha and she informed me they do not have an address and I should go to the post office and send it.  I am unable to go to the post office and she said that the P.O. Box   was the ONLY way to return product.  I guess Guthy Renker gives \\&quot;nasty lessons\\&quot; to their customer service - I hope no one else has had these problems, this is the worst vendor I have ever dealt with!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Proactiv since I was 13. But never had any real issues with my skin until about a year ago. My skin was so oily that I had to put makeup on but when I put the makeup on my skin would flake all over from dead skin. I tried everything in the world. Until finally I just decided to go for it and spend the 40 bucks on Proactiv. And it was honestly the best money I have ever spent. After using Proactiv I would never change to anything else. I will be putting them in business forever. MY only advice is that if you start using it keep using it. Don&#x27;t skip a day of washing your face because if you do my skin becomes dry and it starts breaking out. But as long as I use it twice or even once a day it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I was shocked when these products arrived because they are so small.  I paid $39 for this set and while it says a 30 day supply, there&#x27;s no way these tiny containers will last that long.</li>
    <li> When I first started using Proactiv, I used the orginal one.  My face was clear and I had no problems then I had quit using it for a while and my face started back breaking out and I decided to try the New Advance Proactiv.It burned th right side of my face. It was too Strong so I quit using it and now I am thinking about going back to the original Proactiv.</li>
    <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the size of the products included in this purchase. Total rip off for what you get - there are better deals out there without having to pay over 8 bucks for shipping. My mistake.</li>
    <li> I managed to make it through puberty and high school with very minimal breakouts. I&#x27;m now in my mid twenties and married. When my husband deployed, my eating/sleeping, exercise habits changed along with my stress level. I started breaking out all over my face. For several months I switched from one product to another. I tried store brands, all natural acne kits, department store systems,everything. The products made my face really dry and the breakouts only got better for a few days. Then they would come back worse than before. I finally gave up and decided to try Proactiv. On day 2 of using Proactiv the redness from my breakouts was almost completely gone. By the end of the 2nd week my face was pretty much clear. It&#x27;s made my face clear, soft, and moisturized. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> bought for brother but he never told me if it worked or not because last I saw he wanted me to buy him a neutragena  brush some kit decined for acne.</li>
    <li> Helped clear up my minor acne. I had minor zits popping up and couldn&#x27;t get them from popping up every couple of weeks. Only had to use the cleanser and the moisturizer and the mask for those pesky zits that still wanted to come out, only had to apply it on the zit to be and it was a gone zit in the morning. Now I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup since my skin is cleared up.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s going on almost a month and i haven&#x27;t seen any improvments on my face at all.....  this was my last resort, i have tried almost every thing you can buy, that is why i only got the 30 day kit........ very disapointed</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money on acne products in stores, none of them worked.  I decided to try Proactive.  After a week I started to see a difference.  I&#x27;m 43 years old and have had bad breakouts for about 4 years.  I&#x27;ve literally tried every acne system you can find, and NOTHING! Proactive is actually working.  I&#x27;m so happy with the results!!</li>
    <li> Perfect and good price I would recommend it to everyone one.  Especially if u r an amazon prime customer , perfect</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my niece and she loves proactive, her face is always breaking out, arrived on time, thanks for everything</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try Proactive for years now, and finally took the plunge to try it out. After a few days of using this product daily, my face was itching like crazy. I did the recommended usage and then cut down on some of the regimen to help with what I thought was over-drying. I&#x27;ve used Benzoyl Peroxide products for years so I know that I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it, but after reading the ingredients in each of the proactive bottles, I was floored. After a week of using the product, I woke up with my eyes nearly swollen shut, swollen lips and a red red red face. I&#x27;m allergic to something in Proactiv, but it&#x27;s difficult to narrow down what it is since there are so many ingredients. There&#x27;s parabens galore in all of the products. Also a ton of other ingredients most people can&#x27;t even pronounce. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone trying to stay on a more natural path to skin care. Also definitely not recommended to sensitive skin types.</li>
    <li> I was really worried about my daughter using this product. I have read all the complaints about red skin and such. She has ecsama really bad at times so I was worried it would over dry her skin and cause a break out. But none of that occurred and her faced cleared right up.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try this - after all its just a collection of different soaps, and very expensive ones at that. They are of course different from what many acne treatments contain, and it is their combined use that creates good results. As the other reviewers have noted you need to continue using this and remain... proactive. I&#x27;ve tried several topical and ingested acne medicines before, and have very oily skin. The combination of soaps and treatments in this set have noticeably reduced my skin&#x27;s oiliness and this has resulted fewer and less sever breakouts. I&#x27;m using it once daily, shaving in the morning and applying it at night. Though it is a concern that some of the chemicals can bleach your towel and pillow cases (and anything else) I haven&#x27;t noticed any rub-off or transfer - just let it dry and/or switch to white colors and you&#x27;ll be fine.    The only major drawback to this package is of course the cost - it&#x27;s far beyond any other type of washing treatment, but at the same time it&#x27;s not an antibiotic (which really isn&#x27;t good for you) and so its worth it for the results. It is a little time consuming compared to other washes.  Also, there are no instructions except the small print, many times underneath sticky labels on the containers. It&#x27;s a pain to get to them the first time, but once you have the routine down it&#x27;s no longer an issue. --Wash with the \\&quot;Renewing Cleanser\\&quot;, rinse and pat dry, apply the \\&quot;Revitalizing Toner,\\&quot; allow to dry, apply the \\&quot;Repairing Treatment\\&quot; allow to dry for a while, then apply the moisturizer as needed - probably a good idea since if you&#x27;re using this product you probably have sensitive skin and mine felt by touch like I had a sunburn after a couple days. I only used the mask once, before doing the normal routine, it seemed to work, but again the lack of clear instructions leave me wondering...    Overal, while it is pricey, it is well worth your time to at least try it for one month (longer if one treatment a day) and see if thisworks for you. The benzoyl peroxide that this product relies on can perhaps be replicated by following an online guide, but with one application a day this lasts two months, and I&#x27;m happy to spend $20.00 a month to reduce my acne - that&#x27;s dinner and a movie these days.</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and think i have tried every acne product available... this one takes the cake.  This is the first product that really clears everything up and does not dry out my face.  Also I tend to have very oily skin and usually by halfway through the day my make-up looks orangy and bad because of the oil on my face.  When using this product I no longer have that problem!</li>
    <li> Maybe this product works best for people with mild acne. Did not work at all for my son who has moderate to severe acne.</li>
    <li> Make sure you read the sizes.  The bottles are very tiny, obviously I should have know how big the were going to be before I bought them but I glanced over them and bought anyway.</li>
    <li> Product was received in new condition and on time. I haven&#x27;t used it for long but my skin looks healthier, working on clearing it up. It can be a little irritating, I suggest using some lotion daily.</li>
    <li> this works quickly and very well in clearing up acne. unfornunately it has to be used consistently or you back to square one.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with is product. I have broken out more using it. For the cost of this product it should have worked a ton better. Soap and water is better.</li>
    <li> Used this product as directed - was hoping to get rid of my awful pimples. This was the worst thing I could have used. It burned my skin and irritated me so much that my skin was so dry and peeling. It was so embarrassing. I was better off not using anything at all. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> waste of money, i was hoping for some improvement but it didn&#x27;t even do anything. i would recommend to buy something else</li>
    <li> Proactive can really dry out your face but great for a week here and there to prevent breakouts.</li>
    <li> Bottles are small.  Thought the would be a little  bit more for the money.  But love the product, just one use and I can already see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product several times and I have never gotten very good results from it.  Perhaps you need to be a celebrity.</li>
