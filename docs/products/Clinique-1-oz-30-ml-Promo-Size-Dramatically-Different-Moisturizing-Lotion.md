      <li>THIS IS A GREAT MOISTURIZER AND IS DEFINATELY HANDY IN THE WINTER MONTHS.</li>

      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Within minutes, it absorbs into your skin, and the results are fantastic!</li>
      <li>Feels to greasy.... wasn&#x27;t to satisfied with tbe product.</li>
      <li>I have tried most through the years</li>
      <li>moisturizes well, easy to apply... in short great product!</li>
      <li>I liked this product for the area I live in.</li>
      <li>When I use the moisturizing LOTION, it feels like the right balance of application so that my skin stays fresh and clean throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but Clinique puts out the best when it comes to a daily moisturizer, goes on even, not greasy and keeps you moist and fresh all day long.  </li>
      <li>Very good moisturizer for someone who has very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate area and it works good for that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While Clinque makes the GEL moisturizer, I have found, with my skin type, that the gel makes my skin too dry, thus creating more oil at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>keep the skin in good condition, but can not last long, esp in the winter.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t however use it when I visit more humid places because it feels heavy.</li>
      <li>M Lotion and the Ladies version (this) are exactly the same . .</li>
      <li>Like the old product.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, and does not feel heavy.</li>
      <li>This is the only new product I was using at the time</li>
      <li>I really love that there is no fragrance and a very small amount to cover facial area.</li>

    <li> Delivered as promised.  Would buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for dry skin. Within minutes, it absorbs into your skin, and the results are fantastic! I used it on my hands 3x, and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference!</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite face moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and it works well with my combination skin. It goes on smoothly, and does not feel heavy. I use a dot and mix my foundation in the mornings and it helps the makeup spread evenly, so I don&#x27;t need a lot. Great product.</li>
    <li> Only use this face moisturizer.  Love it</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT MOISTURIZER AND IS DEFINATELY HANDY IN THE WINTER MONTHS. CAME IN GREAT TIME AND IN GREAT PACKAGING!! GREAT PRICE AS WELL!!</li>

    <li> took 3 weeks for delivery . . M Lotion and the Ladies version (this) are exactly the same . . but Men&#x27;s version is 1/3 more expensive.</li>
    <li> This product is working well. I really love that there is no fragrance and a very small amount to cover facial area.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer for someone who has very dry and sensitive skin. There are very few moisturizers my skin can handle.</li>
    <li> Feels to greasy.... wasn&#x27;t to satisfied with tbe product.</li>
    <li> Girflriend loved it.  Says it&#x27;s the best lotion out there.</li>
    <li> I use the Dramatically Different Lotion with NO &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; on it...this is what I appeared to be ordering. When my order was received, it had the &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; which is way to greasy for my skin so I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> perfect!!!! I ordered two, gave one to my colleague, she also loved it. no allergy. moisturizes well, easy to apply... in short great product!</li>
    <li> I use Clinique illuminators, eye liners, and lip glosses regularly.  I got a promo size of this lotion when buying some of their other products.  I used it for 3 days and my neck and chest broke out in a red, itchy rash.  This is the only new product I was using at the time so I&#x27;m assuming it is the culprit.  I stopped using it and it is slowly improving.  I read on several forums that this reaction is not uncommon.  I&#x27;ll still use their other products, but not this one.</li>
    <li> non-greasy, no scent.  Great for around the eyes &amp; forehead.</li>
    <li> keep the skin in good condition, but can not last long, esp in the winter. and  good for combination skin.</li>
    <li> Like the old product.  Will continue searching for it until they are all gone.</li>
    <li> Born with very dry skin I have to use a daily moisturizer that does its job.  I have tried most through the years but Clinique puts out the best when it comes to a daily moisturizer, goes on even, not greasy and keeps you moist and fresh all day long.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
