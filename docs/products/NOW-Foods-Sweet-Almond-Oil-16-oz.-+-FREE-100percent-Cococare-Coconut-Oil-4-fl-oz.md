      <li>The coconut oil they sent was the unfractionated variety and was also 100% all natural, with no additives or preservatives, which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>highly recommend both products, and the Amazon Seller Health Supplement Wholesalers, with wholehearted enthusiasm!!</li>
      <li>This is my first time using these products.</li>
      <li>However, this is the only product that will not irritate my skin and makes it feel completely better.</li>
      <li>The reason why I purchased it in the first place, was by doing research on it.</li>
      <li>This was my first order of almond oil.</li>
      <li>On my next purchase is to get Coconut Oil to cook. :)</li>
      <li>Anything I put on my skin or face becomes irritated and because of that my skin becomes even more dry.</li>
      <li>I use it on my face, arms, legs, my whole body.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Using the almond oil as moisturizer for face is non greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
      <li>WOW!!!</li>
      <li>The Almond oil doesn&#x27;t really absorb into my skin, and the coconut oil just sits on top like a greasy mess.</li>
      <li>I am like many African American woman, trying to find a health way to manage my hair.</li>
      <li>so I know where the new growth without any chemicals was.</li>

    <li> Needed Almond Oil to make an Ayurvedic hair remover and found a FANTASTIC DEAL at Amazon from Health Supplement Wholesalers.  I got the Almond Oil I needed PLUS a tub of Coconut Oil which I love and already used - the price was right.  Very happy to have found it</li>
    <li> This oil is silky, and subtle without a greasy residue.  When I apply it to my skin, not only does it soak right in but it leaves me with a nice glow.  I wish I could add more of a scent; yet, the subtlty of the oil reminds me of how pure it is.  If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I would order all my oils from this company.  I look forward to mixing and matching this oil with others.  I love free gifts and the coconut oil is purity in a container.  I hate lotioning but these products make it effortless.  My dry, dull skin thanks you</li>
    <li> My wife loves this oil and it absorbs really easily into the skin which is a plus and it has no irritation nor does it leave you feeling gross or greasy after use it also blended very well with our aroma scented oils which I loved. Highly recommend this stuff and by the by the coconut oil is great for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to begin a natural facial regimen. This almond oil is fantastic and certainly does the trick without clogging my pores. The coconut oil is great for removing my makeup. Great duo!</li>
    <li> I had not used coconut oil before getting it here as a freebie. Now it is all I use. Lasted forever, too.</li>
    <li> Came on time, great packaging, no problems! Its a gift for someone else, so cant say about quality, but will in a couple of weeks when percipient  gets it!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend it! It actually works and keeps the skin hydrated I love it! Haven&#x27;t been disappointed by this product</li>
    <li> This was my first order of almond oil. Ever. I was really happy when it arrived even before the set date. And that i could track it all the way. The oil is amazing i use on my body and in my homemade body scrubs and creams. I also use it on my toddler instead of baby oil or cream after showering and it has really worked wonders with his atopic skin!! And as a bonus i got some coconut butter too :)) overall very happy except for the shipping price being a bit pricey... but then again it did travel far :)</li>
    <li> The almond oil leaves the skin feeling refreshed and very soft!&lt;br /&gt;Better than lotion! The coconut oil is also a great bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Great service from Health Supplement Wholesalers.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am slowly collecting a variety of oils for hair/body use and this is definitely a great addition! I already use coconut oil and have had great luck with it and now with the almond oil I&#x27;ve noticed a major change in my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Using the almond oil as moisturizer for face is non greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. Using coconut oil as deodorant with lavender essential oil! Works well with no marks on clothing or greasy feel as you&#x27;d expect. Smooth and calming to the skin. I also no use it before and after shaving.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on a cotton pad to remove makeup -- including waterproof mascara.  It works well and leaves my skin soft.  A definite part of my daily facial routine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it for my hair. It was a great value I will definitely order again and it came with a free container of coconut oil which I also love.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using these products. The reason why I purchased it in the first place, was by doing research on it. And I have been using it and it is actually smoothing my skin and scalp. I am happy with it. On my next purchase is to get Coconut Oil to cook. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  The Almond oil doesn&#x27;t really absorb into my skin, and the coconut oil just sits on top like a greasy mess.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive. I also suffer from skin eczema. When I used this product it cleared up my skin patches and moisturized my skin so well leaving it glowing and radiant. Anything I put on my skin or face becomes irritated and because of that my skin becomes even more dry. However, this is the only product that will not irritate my skin and makes it feel completely better. It is also great for massages! Almond Oil and Coconut Oil is great for skin and hair and I could not have been happier with any other product than this.</li>
    <li> I am like many African American woman, trying to find a health way to manage my hair. I survived cancer a couple years ago although I did keep my hair but it was not the same after 6 weeks of radiation and chemo plus another treatment a few weeks later. I colored it a ugly color, thought I knew what I was doing, 3 months after the treatments where over so I know where the new growth without any chemicals was. Now almost all the color is out. I wear a wig with my hair braided underneath waiting until well not sure what I want to do with my hair. I ordered the Sweet Almond Oil, Coconut Oil came with it, and the Jojoba Oil and have noticed immediately the difference in my hair. Note I do not have to use as any other products on my hair. Also, the Sweet Almond Oil can be used on your face. I use to have oily skin before the cancer even at the over 50 age but after the treatments and over the last two years, my face became dry/normal. The Sweet Almond Oil only take a few drops a day and after about 2 weeks I noticed the difference in my face. I am very happy with these oils.</li>
    <li> This beautiful oil is expeller-pressed and hexane-free, which makes it ideal for vegan or vegetarian users alike. Now Foods, the manufacturers of this product, also do not test on animals.  I use this oil as the primary menstruum for my herbal oils, as it is easily absorbed by all skin types, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  It is also an emollient, and soothes, softens and reconditions skin, which makes it excellent for dry, itchy skin conditions. The Amazon Seller of this product, Health Supplement Wholesalers, are awesome. I ordered this product from them, and when it arrived empty (damaged in shipment), they very quickly sent me a new one, and were very pleasant and courteous about the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also included another free product along with the replacement, which they did not need to do. I thought that was excellent customer service. The coconut oil they sent was the unfractionated variety and was also 100% all natural, with no additives or preservatives, which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend both products, and the Amazon Seller Health Supplement Wholesalers, with wholehearted enthusiasm!!</li>
    <li> Sweet Almond Oil  is now my favorite skin product.  I use it on my face, arms, legs, my whole body. My skin smiles with appreciation. I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing. I  haven&#x27;t used the coconut oil as often except on my hands.  The coconut oil seems heavier and greasier, so I ha e shied away from using it.</li>
    <li> I USED THESE TWO PRODUCTS TO MAKE MY BODY BUTTER, THE THIRD INGREDIENT WAS RAW SHEA BUTTER,IT CAME OUT PERFECT!I TEND TO HAVE VERY DRY SKIN AND THE COMBINATION OF THESE THREE PRODUCTS HAVE DONE WONDERS FOR MY SKIN. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AND MAKE THIS AGAIN I ADDED JASMINE FRAGRANCE OIL AND WOW!!!</li>
