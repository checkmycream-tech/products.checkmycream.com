      <li>love the vivid colors</li>
      <li>Great to have and to give away with little gifts in them</li>

      <li>It is durable and if you have little to nothing in your purse it will fit in a medium size purse.</li>
      <li>The bag is much larger than I expected it would be and is in such a cute and summery print.</li>
      <li>It easily holds hreadphones (not earbuds yuck), lock, small brush and wallet.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and concluded it was bigger than expected, which proved to be true.</li>
      <li>It is a lovely product ~ but just too big for a small make up bag for my purse.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be definitely purchasing at least two more to keep my blushes, foundation, face cremes and lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I needed a bigger make up bag, as my old one could no longer hold all the make up and supplies I had.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute bag. It can&#x27;t hold a lot of stuff just the regular essentials. It&#x27;s bright and cheery. Wish it was a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> too big for everyday use but good quality and nice color. Only complaint that there isn&#x27;t any inside pocket.</li>
    <li> I read the measurements but still didn&#x27;t realize it would be this big! It is perfect!!! Very sturdy and cute bag that fits all of my cosmetics and a hair brush.  I might buy some more as gifts!</li>
    <li> This is an adorable bag but the colors weren&#x27;t as vibrant as my screen made me think. It&#x27;s a great size for a traveling case and is still quite girly, came in two days which is unbelievable!</li>
    <li> I bought this as my mini gym bag. It easily holds hreadphones (not earbuds yuck), lock, small brush and wallet. Very cute pattern.</li>
    <li> nice bags,  using for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Sophisticated, girly and cute are the three words to describe this cosmetic bag.  I keep my 3 Urban Decay Naked palettes, Too Faced Chocolate Palette and my Wizard of Oz palette in this bag and I still have enough space left. I think it&#x27;s perfect to keep your makeup organized or just to fit your daily makeup whenever you are traveling.  I&#x27;ll be definitely purchasing at least two more to keep my blushes, foundation, face cremes and lipsticks.</li>
    <li> love the vivid colors</li>
    <li> Though it was quite larger than I expected, It&#x27;s still a wonderful bag. Any Lilly fan will love this bag&#x27;s quality and style.</li>
    <li> I got the bag in a good time frame. The bag is not really that cute to me but it was cheap then the other bags I would have rather gotten. The shipment did cost more then the bag it self. As for the bag, it is not to big or to little. The bag opens up very wide so you can put a lot in the bag. It is durable and if you have little to nothing in your purse it will fit in a medium size purse.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this bag. It appears a lot larger in the picture. It is not at all what I thought it would be or what I was wanting.</li>
    <li> The bag is very pretty. It is quite large, so all of my everyday makeup fits there. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, definitely recomment the seller. Thank you.</li>

    <li> I actually bought this for my blood pressure cuff &amp; stethoscope for school, so I cannot comment on the cosmetic bag benefits. It is beautifully and strongly made, and serves its purpose.
