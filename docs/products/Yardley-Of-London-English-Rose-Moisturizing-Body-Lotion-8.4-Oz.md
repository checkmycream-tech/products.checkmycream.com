      <li>very soft smell that stays</li>
      <li>Soft and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when  it was in my mailbox so soon.</li>
      <li>However, if you do use this with it make sure that scent is subtle or it will over power this smell.</li>
      <li>The smell of roses brings back childhood memories, so when I came across a small container of this rose-scented lotion I simply fell in love.  </li>

    <li> It smells so wonderful. It has a mild rose scent and makes me smell lovely. If you wear this, I truly don&#x27;t believe you need perfume. However, if you do use this with it make sure that scent is subtle or it will over power this smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. Makes my skin soft and great fragrance. I bought an extra bottle and will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This product is too greasy and smells terrible!</li>
    <li> Very nice, if pricey for the amount received. Can&#x27;t be found in stores, even if requested.</li>

    <li> Lovely scent. English rose is my favorite.Soft and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Will definately be ordering another. Glad I found it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Great lotion, pump quit working, so I have to take the pump out and pour the lotion into my hand</li>
    <li> smells good but once you put it on it has a weird dead flower smell.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off and give it away to someone else.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for my great grandma right before she died of a massive stroke.  She loved the scent of roses and I wanted her to know she was loved when we would rub this lotion on her.  It has a strong scent in the beginning, but later the scent begins to tone down, but the lingering scent is very gentle.  I still wear this lotion to remind me of my great grandma.  its a wonderful smell, just like grandma.  It lingers in the air and just has that gentle ghostly smell if that makes sense.  Grandma lived 103 years and her last few days she was living, she lived in a nursing home.  When I bought this lotion, she got it right the day before she passed on to be with God.  She is now in heaven with her roses and with God!</li>
    <li> very soft smell that stays</li>

    <li> Yardley&#x27;s English Rose body lotion has a very light smell. The lotion&#x27;s consistency is pleasant Overall I am pleased with my purchase..</li>
    <li> effective and a nice soft scent</li>
    <li> I bought this because a lot of reviewers said it was light and floral. This had really good reviews so I went ahead and got it. I wish I would have just bough something from the store. I don&#x27;t hate it, but It won&#x27;t be something I&#x27;ll be using daily. I&#x27;m not a fan of strong smelling things so it&#x27;s just a personal preference. But if you like light floral lotion/perfume and have never used this, I&#x27;d consider looking around a bit. This smells nothing like rose to me but more of a strong perfume, something your mom would wear. I did give it to my mother, and she loved it (so maybe a good mother&#x27;s day gift?)</li>
    <li> I  love it  the smell is just  like roses!</li>
    <li> Good softening lotion with pleasant smell of roses.</li>
    <li> Oh My goodness this is the best smelling rose lotion from Yardley.  I put this on and when I go outside, I got bees swarmming around me...now that tells you something, when the bees think that you are a rose!  This lotion smells so good and stays with you all through the day.  I just Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is most difficult or locate in the Chocolate City (Washington DC) area.  So when I am down to one bottle I order another, given that they ship from London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was pleasantly surprised when  it was in my mailbox so soon.</li>
