    <li> The flowers are HUGE.  Also, these would not fit a baby that is 0-3 months unless they were in the higher percentiles for weight and height.  My daughter is now 9 months old and they just fit.  She is in the 35% for weight if that helps anyone else considering these.</li>
    <li> I received them a little earlier than expected they are beautiful. I would not recommend for a new born they were a lot bigger than expected. My god-daughter is a month old and has slender feet. It&#x27;s made for babies a little bigger with those cute chucky feet. She has done growing to do before she can fit them.</li>
    <li> I just love the pattern on these! They look so cute on my little one! Thank you so, so much!!!</li>
    <li> The flower on the sandal fell apart within 10 minutes of placing on the baby&#x27;s foot.  The  maker of the sandal would not reimburse me or replace the sandal.  Very poorly made.  One thread holds the flower in place.  You could make this yourself.</li>
    <li> Cute idea. Wasn&#x27;t a fan of these colors.</li>
    <li> Very pretty just to big for my 1 year old girl</li>
    <li> its nice,small and cute !!</li>

    <li> Very cute loved the quality of the sandals. Shipping was fast :-)</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t want to stay on my daughter&#x27;s feet. It says 0-12 months, and it seems like it&#x27;s more towards the 12 than the 0.</li>
    <li> Very big for a newborn child, my 4yr old can use these for praise dancing.... Poorly made product.. Very will I purchase from this company..</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely give yall a 0 why because yall took my money and didn&#x27;t send me anything its ridiculous !</li>
    <li> These I must say made a fashion statement for my niece, everyone just loved it, Too cute.</li>
    <li> These were much to big for my newborn. The color is actually a little darker when you see them in person. Here in the picture the flower is nice and full. Once I actually received these barefoot shoes, I noticed that the flower doesn&#x27;t stay open. It just flops to the side and closes up. It doesn&#x27;t really look like a flower at all.</li>
    <li> Fall apart very easily. Cute the couple of times she was able to wear them though.</li>
