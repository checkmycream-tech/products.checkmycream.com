      <li>The reason I came on here was to buy more more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Nice and smooth</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it lasts all day on me, and I have gotten compliments on it aswell.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal needs to use better materials to make this more user friendly!</li>

      <li>Does it&#x27;s job nicely, i&#x27;ve used it plenty of times and the results are amazing to great, would not buy for any other brand, these do the job</li>

      <li>It isn&#x27;t as good as the Extra-Intense Liquid Pencil and it costs twice as much.  </li>
      <li>I love love love this and am so happy to see it on Amazon for so much cheaper than what I normally buy it for.</li>
      <li>You have to have the right kind of sharpener and it sharpens just fine.</li>

      <li>The only nice thing I can say about this pencil is the &amp;#34;Plum&amp;#34; color is really good</li>
      <li>This liner goes on so smooth with out dragging.</li>
      <li>would be a great product if it actually lasted.</li>
      <li>much to my horror, I discovered it had stained my eyelids!!!</li>
      <li>I wipe my eyes and they are kinda watery and for the most part, it works very well!</li>
      <li>It goes on clumpy/waxy &amp; does not smudge to a clean line.  </li>
      <li>I was right!</li>
      <li>Goes on pretty smooth.</li>
      <li>I am not fair skinned, I used a primer, &amp; I consider myself very experienced with makeup.</li>
      <li>My new favorite eye-liner</li>
      <li>I tried sharpening it thinking it just needed a fresh edge;</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work and can not be sharpened because there is a metal band near the top.</li>
      <li>For some reason I did not throw it away right then and there because I found it in my makeup bag</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>Gave this another try and really like it now!</li>
      <li>I used a primer &amp; the first thing I noticed was It does not set.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not difficult to find out if you do research.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s funny seeing all the people saying it doesn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
      <li>It does smudge into a straight line though!</li>
      <li>it okay when you first open it.</li>
      <li>first b4 applying the eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Dark, smooth- easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>- they usually make really good makeup.  </li>
      <li>breaks off and will not sharpen cleanly....not my sharpener as it sharpens other pencils cleanly and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge as much as my others but it does smudge.</li>
      <li>but this went straight to the trash.</li>
      <li>How could you possibly make such a great product that WONT sharpen and only breaks.</li>
      <li>Lance (real name)</li>
      <li>Glides on very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The pencil goes on very smoothly, more than other pencils, for example Cover Girl.</li>
      <li>I suppose if I sharpen it again and wait with a meat thermometer in it until it is exactly the right temperature it&#x27;ll work for a short window of time, but I think I&#x27;m going to throw it away (again?) and put a heavy rock on top of the trash can</li>
      <li>I have went through many eyeliners (different brands, different types)...</li>
      <li>I have a decent one, but it was a disaster.</li>
      <li>As you see I had high expectations</li>
      <li>Within a few minutes it was transferring to my top lid.</li>
      <li>Nice and dark, very black, glides on quickly.</li>
      <li>Even brand new</li>
      <li>My new favorite!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This morning I could not get my sharpener past the gold ring around the top.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the color the smooth line and its like silk, but I am sorry sharpening is a pain I nearly threw it away because I can&#x27;t get it to sharpen.</li>
      <li>It would not sharpen at first, then when it finally did the tip kept breaking off, creating a huge mess to dig out of the sharpener tip.</li>
      <li>I was looking for the blackest of the black eyeliners, also one that glides on smoothly, looks kinda liquidity.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No good after sharpening. It gets really soft and hard to use. I definitely would not recommend this.  UPDATE ---- Gave this another try and really like it now! Nice and smooth and once it dries down doesn&#x27;t budge!</li>
    <li> I have went through many eyeliners (different brands, different types)... And I have to say this is by far my favorite of them all!!! I am soo glad I came across this one! I love the fact that it lasts all day on me, and I have gotten compliments on it aswell. Girls are always asking me what type of eyeliner Im wearing. If you have oily eyelids I recommend primer first b4 applying the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and I&#x27;ve always had a horrible time applying eyeliner.  I agree that it&#x27;s not the easiest to remove but I am so happy it lasts through the day and still looks good at night.  I&#x27;ve never experienced that before.  Wish I found something like this years ago.  I ordered it in black but I am also going to get one in brown.</li>
    <li> I love it! Goes on smooth and looks great!</li>
    <li> I would give this no stars if I could. Being a makeup artist, I found this to be very messy. Yes it is smooth and very black but it&#x27;s impossible to control and very hard to clean off. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest eyeliner I have tried and I have tried a lot!  So I have ended up never wearing eyeliner until I found this. I line my upper lash line and then just below my upper lash line. I tried it by only doing one eye to see the results.  They were amazing!  The only thing I don&#x27;t understand is the sharpening.  Why  didn&#x27;t L&#x27;Oreal make sharpening possible?  Or am I missing something?</li>
    <li> Lid arrived jammed onto liner super tight. I finally had to yank it off thereby knocking off the tip of the liner. As other reviewers have said, this liner is impossible to sharpen. So I have no idea whether it works or not, but it&#x27;s been a total waste of my time and money.</li>
    <li> The pencil goes on very smoothly, more than other pencils, for example Cover Girl.</li>
    <li> Dark, smooth- easy to apply.  My new favorite eye-liner</li>
    <li> Easy to use and stays on all day!</li>
    <li> I like using pencils for eyeliners and L&#x27;oreal is one of my favorite companies. However, I purchased this at the local Target and tried to sharpen it after several uses. This morning I could not get my sharpener past the gold ring around the top. I finally had to go into our tool box and cut below the gold band, then tried to use my eyeliner sharpener. Still no luck, it is now in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;Pat Lance (real name)</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I have used.  One does need to reapply as the day goes on.  I like how soft and dark it is.  Glides on very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not apply throughout the day, I am one of those, once and done and I don&#x27;t care as the day moves on but I&#x27;m sure it would stay better when used with a primer.</li>
    <li> My holy grail eyeliner</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever purchased! The only reason I bought it (at my local Target) is because they were out of my usual eyeliner so I decided to give this a try. What I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on very smoothly and precisely&lt;br /&gt;Looks like a liquid liner only without the mess and has a mat finish which I prefer to glossy&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly; actually seems to go on dry&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;Does not flake, smear or smudge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CAN sharper this pencil! It&#x27;s not intuitive by looking at it; seems like it should twist similar to other eyeliners. Also, because of the gold band it looks like it&#x27;s not supposed to be sharpened. I used a plain old plastic sharpener. It was a little tough at first, cutting through that gold band, but once it did it was much easier and more product was revealed. I was relieved because some reviewers mistakenly wrote that once the tip is used or not sharp you have to throw it away. I think L&#x27;Oreal should redo the pencil so it&#x27;s easier to sharpen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this liner!</li>
    <li> breaks off and will not sharpen cleanly....not my sharpener as it sharpens other pencils cleanly and smoothly.  when it is sharpened, it is not smooth on the pencil end.  It will scratch your eye if you put it up to the fragile eye area.  A big rip off!</li>
    <li> It went on fantastic and very smooth but within a couple minutes it was transferring to my bottom lash line where I did not want it. I would wipe away the smudges to just have them return minutes later. That fact that I have very dry skin and it did this amazed me, man what would I look like if I had oily skin. I tried this on 3 separate occasions and had the same result every time to where I spent all day trying to keep the racoon eyes at bay. What really shocked me is I thought will since it keeps coming off it should be easy to remove. NOPE. Even with my oiliest eye make up remover it just smears everywhere and doesn&#x27;t come off. I went to sleep thinking I finally got it all off and woke up to black eyeliner all over my eyes. I have never thrown away eyeliner before but this went straight to the trash.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the blackest of the black eyeliners, also one that glides on smoothly, looks kinda liquidity. As you see I had high expectations and  I was more than highly satisfied. I also found that amazon had one of the best prices.</li>
    <li> this eyeliner is great but I only gave one star because you only get about a week and a half of use out of it. maybe two. this is actually the second one I bought because I thought the first one was just defective and wouldn&#x27;t roll anymore out. I spent forever trying to figure out how to get more of the product to come out until I went online and found out there is no more product. you just get the little bit that you see and that does not last long. would be a great product if it actually lasted. don&#x27;t waste your money. unless of course you have money to waste.</li>
    <li> This was hands down the worst eye liner &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used. Even brand new it was very difficult to control where the line went. Granted, it is very opaque and once it&#x27;s on for a while it stays in place, but I had all kinds of little chunks of it in my eyes after I first put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it was time to sharpen it. I tried turning the bottom of the pencil, but nothing happened. So I thought maybe it required a sharpener. I have a decent one, but it was a disaster. It would not sharpen at first, then when it finally did the tip kept breaking off, creating a huge mess to dig out of the sharpener tip. I was left with jagged pieces of plastic I had to try to remove by hand. Then, when I went to apply it the whole thing was extra soft and basically coated my entire eyelashes Tammy Faye-Bakker style! Even under normal circumstances it would take three applications of cold cream to get this stuff off, but after this Sharpening Event I thought I would be there all day removing the liner from my eyes. For some reason I did not throw it away right then and there because I found it in my makeup bag (it probably climbed back in there from the trash). I got a little curious, thinking maybe it &amp;#34;settled down&amp;#34; and wouldn&#x27;t be so soft. I was right! It was as hard as a rock and did not work. I suppose if I sharpen it again and wait with a meat thermometer in it until it is exactly the right temperature it&#x27;ll work for a short window of time, but I think I&#x27;m going to throw it away (again?) and put a heavy rock on top of the trash can so it stays in there this time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color the smooth line and its like silk, but I am sorry sharpening is a pain I nearly threw it away because I can&#x27;t get it to sharpen.</li>
    <li> I love the texture but very difficult to sharpen, leaves sharp edges and the pencil gets stuck in the sharpener.</li>
    <li> These eyeliners are amazing IF you don&#x27;t wear contacts! I had no problems when using these while wearing glasses. When I had my contacts in, it was a whole different story. DO NOT use this on your waterline... or even your lid... if you wear contacts. As soon as you blink a few times, you&#x27;re half blind. The liner transfers onto your contacts and creates this cloudy film you can&#x27;t see through, that doesn&#x27;t go away. I had to throw my contacts out, they couldn&#x27;t be salvaged after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly a little aggravated there&#x27;s not a warning on Silkissime liners that they&#x27;re not safe for use with contacts... Because they&#x27;re definitely NOT.</li>
    <li> It goes on like a liquid and really thick. I tried sharpening it to make it thinner but didn&#x27;t work.  No way to look somewhat natural. It doesn&#x27;t smudge as much as my others but it does smudge. I&#x27;ll keep playing around with it but so far I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst eyeliner pencils I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on clumpy/waxy &amp; does not smudge to a clean line.  I can&#x27;t believe this is a L&#x27;Oreal product  - they usually make really good makeup.  I tried sharpening it thinking it just needed a fresh edge; no difference.  The only nice thing I can say about this pencil is the &amp;#34;Plum&amp;#34; color is really good but this is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> The plum color is very pretty and this glides on great. The problem is that this WILL NOT smudge and I can&#x27;t use eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge because the line is too harsh if not blended. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all. I returned it to the store from where I bought it. Always save your receipts!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product!  You can never sharpen the pencil, the outside part of the pencil is too thick to sharpen on a makeup pencil sharpen, I have tried different types of pencil sharpeners including electric, you just end up losing a lot of the pencil and the lead is so soft it continuously breaks up.  You end up just wasting your money.  L&#x27;Oreal needs to use better materials to make this more user friendly!</li>
    <li> My new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve used to date. I&#x27;ve cried my tears out and I never smudged👍😃</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this eye liner.  I was looking to replace a discontinued L&#x27;Oreal eyeliner, as I&#x27;ve always been happy with L&#x27;Oreal eye products.  Product meets or exceeds my expectations for the perfect eyeliner.  Glides on easy &amp; is slightly smudgable briefly after applied.  Does not wear off, yet easy to remove (as easy as any long-wear eyeliner) at end of day.  Dark black color doesn&#x27;t fade. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am confused with some of these reviews!!!&lt;br /&gt;First off, to the one saying you can&#x27;t sharpen it? Yes you can. I&#x27;ve sharpened mine many times. I have 4 colors and rah can be sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;Second off, to the one talking about it not coming off with make up wipes: I am not sure what brand of wipes you use (I use neutrogena wipes in the light blu bag) but mine wipes off just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this eyeliner!! It glides on so smoothly and it&#x27;s super easy to apply!! The reason I came on here was to buy more more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far.... No problems and I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Bought two pencils. The tip completely broke off the pencil shortly after taking it out of the package. Otherwise, this is one of the best eye pencils I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The new formulation is hard as a rock. It&#x27;s very hard to apply. The earlier product might have been hard to sharpen ,but you got color and ease of application,  but not any more. It&#x27;s still hard to sharpen and very little, if any, color. It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! great staying power and glides on smooth like a liquid liner!</li>
    <li> The best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used! Very creamy and dark</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I was expecting :)</li>
    <li> Great pencil. Great price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eyeliner pencils that I have ever used.  It is a &#x27;soft&#x27; pencil and I use it to add color to my eyebrows.  I work 12-16 hour at a time and it stays in place perfectly.</li>
    <li> Why do companies make products that are so misleading and wasteful? It&#x27;s supposted to twist to extend the tip but it doesn&#x27;t work and can not be sharpened because there is a metal band near the top.</li>
    <li> It goes on well, but only lasts for a few applications.  There is no way to sharpen.  What was l&#x27;oreal thinking with this product???</li>
    <li> The perfect soft liner- as recommended by allure.  I love it, and we re-order when I need a refill.</li>
    <li> I know there are very mixed reviews but I still had to get this and I have to say, I really liked it! But, if u don&#x27;t want a thick line, lk the commercial showed, don&#x27;t buy it, because u use it the way it comes. It does smudge into a straight line though! I wipe my eyes and they are kinda watery and for the most part, it works very well! It hardly comes off our smears!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this eyeliner until I realized what everyone was complaining about. The liner itself is amazing. Goes on like butter. Nice and dark, very black, glides on quickly. HOWEVER, the second you need to sharpen this is CHEWS up the pencil something awful!  Then the liner keeps breaking over and over chewing up the pencil like mad!!  LOREAL you need to step up your game and FIX this once and for all. Make a sharpener that comes WITH the package and does NOT tear up the pencil. Not wasting my money on this any more!!  How could you possibly make such a great product that WONT sharpen and only breaks. Fix the problem!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing pencil in that if mimics a liquid liner as close as I&#x27;ve ever seen without having all the negatives of a liquid liner.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write product reviews, but I had to for this eyeliner.  It&#x27;s perfect for me</li>
    <li> I love it. It doesn&#x27;t run and stays on all day. I just hate the fact it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other pencils ( I use 2 a month) and finding a sharpener for it is never easy</li>
    <li> Glides on nice,good color payoff. I got the teal shade. I used a primer &amp; the first thing I noticed was It does not set. Within a few minutes it was transferring to my top lid. I set it with a translucent powder &amp; went about my day. 11 hours later I was taking my makeup off for bed. much to my horror, I discovered it had stained my eyelids!!! I have never had this happen before, ever! I am not fair skinned, I used a primer, &amp; I consider myself very experienced with makeup. Unbelievable!  I used 2 cleansers as well as a makeup wipe and still had a perfect shadow on my lid where the liner was! DO NOT BUY THIS! I will never purchase this again. This one went promptly in the trash after one application.</li>
    <li> Horrible. I mean, the liner itself it okay when you first open it. Goes on pretty smooth. A little thick for me, but after the first couple of times I was getting used to it, and actually starting to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN I TRIED TO SHARPEN IT. WHAT A NIGHTMARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never will I buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as good as the Extra-Intense Liquid Pencil and it costs twice as much.  Using it once was enough.  I&#x27;ll never buuy this product again!</li>
    <li> WATERPROOF,FOR TEARY EYES LIKE MINE</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job nicely, i&#x27;ve used it plenty of times and the results are amazing to great, would not buy for any other brand, these do the job as it should and btw just gave it 1 star less because it had a weird smell, but then it worn of.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. I think it&#x27;s funny seeing all the people saying it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;roll up&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not supposed to. You sharpen it. You have to have the right kind of sharpener and it sharpens just fine. It&#x27;s not difficult to find out if you do research. I love love love this and am so happy to see it on Amazon for so much cheaper than what I normally buy it for. Definitely will be ordering a few and will continue if it stays this resonable.</li>
    <li> The best eyeliner ever...</li>
    <li> This liner goes on so smooth with out dragging. Lasts for about 5-6 hours . Wish it were longer.</li>
