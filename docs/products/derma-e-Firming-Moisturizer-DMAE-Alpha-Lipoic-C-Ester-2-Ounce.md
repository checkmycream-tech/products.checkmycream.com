      <li>This cream is great easy to apply and absorbed quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product, as my 70-year-old secretary has a beautiful complexion and attributes it to DermaE.  </li>

      <li>Have re-ordered many times.</li>
      <li>I like it so much better than another product I tried by Dr. P.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer since 2007 and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>just my opinion, but over the counter ROC does better</li>
      <li>Really Love this face cream.  </li>
      <li>I found it by looking for the ingredients that seem to help the most with aging skin in a product that I could afford.  </li>
      <li>glad I didnt pay an arm and a leg for this...</li>
      <li>I do love the derma e. Does not make me feel oily</li>
      <li>** Think twice before using organic and thinking it is safe.</li>
      <li>I love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be doing what it says it will do Im giving it another month before I go back to my search for the perfect firming cream..</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>that is very fair and tends to get red.</li>
      <li>Cream goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin very quickly so you are able to apply makeup and sunscreen over it.</li>
      <li>could not believe how cheap the products were for the job they performed.</li>
      <li>Really loved this cream, until my skin became super sensitive to it.</li>
      <li>I just finished my first jar of this product and have ordered 2 more.....</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that any higher priced cream could do any better than this one.  </li>
      <li>I continue to use it anyway, hoping that maybe over time I&#x27;ll see something improve over and above just a pleasant moisturing.  </li>
      <li>the scent is nice, not overwhelming but pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it did anything special and did not like the odor.  </li>
      <li>I really thought it would be better -</li>
      <li>Love this cream...gets really hot after first using and I have to fan myself for about 5 minutes or so</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and is NOT greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I am used to its smell now and feel good on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t see any reduction of fine lines or large pores.</li>
      <li>Product works wonderful although I have to add an additional moisturizer to my face because I have extra dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Smells a little funky, but great for my skin.</li>
      <li>I almost exclusively used Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle cream - which felt good and stopped certain patches on my face that would get red and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It feels great on my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
      <li>Worth it for the price</li>
      <li>but it seems to be worth the effort.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth-I&#x27;ve also seen a reduction in scars &amp; hyper pigmentation-BONUS:)</li>
      <li>I bought the lotion because I have a beginning of smile lines (I&#x27;m in my 20s)</li>
      <li>I love the way it tightens my skin, yet keeps it soft.  </li>
      <li>I am so pleased with the product, the company and especially the outcome from using it.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>so much she keeps taking mine!</li>
      <li>and I love the smell I do see some wrinkles starting to lighten up over all I like it</li>
      <li>Smooth soft skin.</li>
      <li>This gives my skin a younger and more supple appearance.</li>
      <li>actually don&#x27;t love the fact that it comes in a pot, because I have semi long fingernails (1/4&amp;#34; length), and it irks me every time I have to use my finger to dig into the pot of face cream and get a supply of it under the pointer finger fingernail - to me</li>
      <li>So when I contacted the company they pretty much treated me like I did not even matter...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product as well as a few others I plan to review today.</li>
      <li>I use this Derma e DMAE firming  cream with the Pure Body Naturals Vitamin C Serum it has done wonder for my face and neck.</li>
      <li>Many face creams leave a certain greasy, oily, tacky or other texture that I dislike, so I am very particular and for years (a decade maybe?)</li>
      <li>and this was not the real Derma E product.</li>
      <li>used for one week and see much toner skin..</li>
      <li>Thank you for creating a product that really works.</li>
      <li>I have been using for about 1 month but not seeing much of difference.  </li>
      <li>It smells very offensive.</li>
      <li>fast shipping</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Smells like burning rubber, so much that my husband shoo-ed me away after</li>
      <li>very good&lt;</li>
      <li>I really like this firming moisturizer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this product for years and I love it. makes your skin plump up and is non greasy also..</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer - not greasy and makes me look great! :)</li>
    <li> The product actually works. I have oily 56 year old skin and never had any problems with breakouts using derma e firming moisturizer. Really loved this cream, until my skin became super sensitive to it. For some reason, using it causes a burning, itchy rash on my skin. So derma e firming moisturizer ended up not working for me, but if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really happy with the moisturizing results.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a great moisturizer! Absorbs quickly and is NOT greasy at all. Have re-ordered many times.</li>
    <li> This cream is great easy to apply and absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve use this cream for about two weeks,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> I order this every couple of months and have been using for years... if you can use DMAE... this is a great product!  (I have very sensitive skin, but can use the derma e DMAE products with no problem!</li>
    <li> Love this cream...gets really hot after first using and I have to fan myself for about 5 minutes or so but it seems to be worth the effort. Skin feels firmer in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Skin seems to be firmer, will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Provides firm, soft, small wrinkle healing formula that tightens every pore of your skin.</li>
    <li> Not sure that I see any dramatic results, but it seems to keep my face moisturized and soft. Great price!</li>
    <li> I really like this firming moisturizer.  I was using this twice a day until I found out it has no sunscreen in it, so now I just use it at night.</li>
    <li> not sure yet, the cosmetics box came busted looking :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer since 2007 and absolutely love it. Within a couple of weeks of using it, the texture of my skin improved. It feels moisturized and very smooth. I&#x27;ve experienced no breakouts at all with this. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and can be worn easily under makeup without it feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> It seems to be doing what it says it will do Im giving it another month before I go back to my search for the perfect firming cream..</li>
    <li> I was using another brand and got tired of paying such high prices. I researched products with the same ingredients and found this one. Now I can&#x27;t live without it. If you have sensitive skin, you may need to ease into it by using a small amount every other day. Once your skin is use to it, you can use it daily. I love the smell and how soft it makes my skin feel. It appears to work as well as the expensive brands so why pay extra.</li>
    <li> I do love the derma e. Does not make me feel oily and I like the way my face feels after i use it.</li>
    <li> concentrated anti-oxidants !! great product doesn&#x27;t need to come with flashy package &amp; advertisement. Try &amp; you will stick with it. !! ;)</li>
    <li> I really thought it would be better - it is just ordinary.  Won&#x27;t buy it again but will use it up.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, as my 70-year-old secretary has a beautiful complexion and attributes it to DermaE.  Unfortunately, I did not experience the same beautiful, clear, smooth complexion as she has.  Perhaps someone with less dry skin would benefit from this product.</li>
    <li> I use mostly DermaE products ( over three or four years )and had never had a bad reaction but this product turned me red,swelling, and was terrible. the lot # is 130417 has anyone else had this problem from this product ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** After posting this I read the ingredients on the Firming Cleanser and it contained the same exact things as the moisturizer. The moisturizer has a *** some what warning saying to do a spot test...The Cleaner has no warning at all. So when I contacted the company they pretty much treated me like I did not even matter...now mind you I ended up in the ER over this *** Think twice before using organic and thinking it is safe.</li>
    <li> Many face creams leave a certain greasy, oily, tacky or other texture that I dislike, so I am very particular and for years (a decade maybe?) I almost exclusively used Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle cream - which felt good and stopped certain patches on my face that would get red and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read good things about this DMAE so I decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve been using for 5 months, and it&#x27;s really hard to be objective about subtle changes over a long time, such as skin texture or pores etc. - so I can&#x27;t say that I see any discernible change or improvement.  What I can say is that the texture is every bit as pleasant and innocuous as my former Neutrogena, it moisturizes without leaving any residue or annoying tacky texture, and the reddish scaly patches did not return, so it&#x27;s at least equivalent to Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually don&#x27;t love the fact that it comes in a pot, because I have semi long fingernails (1/4&amp;#34; length), and it irks me every time I have to use my finger to dig into the pot of face cream and get a supply of it under the pointer finger fingernail - to me it&#x27;s superior to squeeze it from a tube, and I wish they&#x27;d offer that option.  I continue to use it anyway, hoping that maybe over time I&#x27;ll see something improve over and above just a pleasant moisturing.  The main area I&#x27;m watching is my neck, which is getting wrinkled.  I would guess I wouldn&#x27;t see a change if any, for like a year.  Will return with an update if I feel I can see anything noticeable.</li>
    <li> Really Love this face cream.  Noticeable affect on smoothing of skin and the scent is nice, not overwhelming but pleasant.  Both my husband and I use it with equal satisfaction,</li>
    <li> Second time to buy it! I am used to its smell now and feel good on my dry skin. I use it day and night. Perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Works great. Smooth soft skin.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, too soon to tell but have noticed some difference in the texture of my skin.  Didn&#x27;t find it heavy to clog pores.  Worth it for the price</li>
    <li> not sure if it&#x27;s working, but supplier is quick-no complaints</li>
    <li> I am not sure I can speak to any huge results and I have been using this for over 3 months. However, I will say that there seems to be less irritation on my skin that is very fair and tends to get red. It does not make me break out which is a win for me in terms of a good night cream.</li>
    <li> I received an inauthentic product. I know this product when I see it and smell it I&#x27;ve been using it for years and this was not the real Derma E product. I have already sent it back, we will see if I get a refund....</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer!! Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth-I&#x27;ve also seen a reduction in scars &amp; hyper pigmentation-BONUS:) Seller was GREAT- packaged nicely-shipped fast:) thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Great moisterizer!</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this before....IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!  I am turning 71 and have been using this now forgoing on 2 years.  I found it by looking for the ingredients that seem to help the most with aging skin in a product that I could afford.  I can&#x27;t imagine that any higher priced cream could do any better than this one.  I am so pleased with the product, the company and especially the outcome from using it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great. It smells very offensive.</li>
    <li> Think I see improvement</li>
    <li> Another person who gave a review to this product said the exact same things I found wrong with my order. First of all, the lotion under the protective lid (the interior one) was yellow and crusty as if it was expired - the color of the lotion inside was a dirty gray so that yellow part was definitely expired! Then the product smelled awful! My husband was grossed out too (I hoped he wouldn&#x27;t notice but he sensed it immediately.) And the worst part is that I used it at night before bed and the next morning my skin was SAGGING!!!!! I bought the lotion because I have a beginning of smile lines (I&#x27;m in my 20s) but the next morning my skin looked like a 50 year old woman!!! I honestly thought that that was it, that I had ruined my skin for these silly smile lines that hubby says they&#x27;re not even noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I do facial exercises everyday for 15 minutes so I tried to that hoping that it work and it did a little but my skin is still sagging on my jawline!! The lotion went in the trash immediately and you bet I&#x27;m never gonna buy it again ..at least not from Amazon or this Web Vitamins!&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, when i bought this product, I bought also the Firming Eye Serum with Alpha Lipoic Acid Vitamin C Ester &amp; DMAE (it was suggested when I tried to buy the Derma E Firming moisturizer) and this lotion does do what it says it does! I use it on all of my face not just the eyes and it works (thank God!). Next time I buy something from Amazon I will take in consideration only the bad reviews!!</li>
    <li> I started using this moisturizer about a year ago to help hydrate and firm my face and neck area, I wanted a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t heavy and didn&#x27;t have a strong smell and in my price range, I found all of that with derma e. I have very dry skin, I use this with derma e Pycnogenol and Hyaluronic Acid Eye Cr&amp;egrave;me during the day and derma e Hyaluronic Acid Night Cr&amp;egrave;me before I go to bed!&lt;br /&gt;I have had to actually buy extra because my daughter likes it so much she keeps taking mine!</li>
    <li> I love the way it tightens my skin, yet keeps it soft.  Excellent product for my 56 year old sun damaged skin.</li>
    <li> Smells a little funky, but great for my skin. I don&#x27;t know about all the DMAE, firming, etc. It leaves my skin looking and feeling nice. It&#x27;s light so a good daytime cream to wear under makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!! I have used it for about 2 years now!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great firming moisturizer - I use it every evening and it definitely helps with the firmness</li>
    <li> Give it at least 3 to 4 weeks skin feels softer cleaner and has that glow it once had and I love the smell I do see some wrinkles starting to lighten up over all I like it</li>
    <li> fast shipping and it is just as described. but this burns when i use it.</li>
    <li> product is great, seeing positive results.</li>
    <li> If I could give this ten stars, I would. It seems to be healing my sun damage, specifically, two small red areas that get flaky. They were quite noticeable. Now, one is nearly gone and the other is shrinking. I wear this every day under my sunscreen and have been using it once or twice a day for a month. It also lessens the appearance of wrinkles by plumping up the skin. All for a great price!</li>
    <li> Product works wonderful although I have to add an additional moisturizer to my face because I have extra dry skin.  This gives my skin a younger and more supple appearance.</li>
    <li> I use this Derma e DMAE firming  cream with the Pure Body Naturals Vitamin C Serum it has done wonder for my face and neck. People comment on how my face glows.&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe how cheap the products were for the job they performed. I have used some very pricey products in the past that did nothing.. I have been using these products since May2015.</li>
    <li> I use every night after cleansing my face resulting in smooth facial skin and neck.  It also benefits my décolletage.</li>
    <li> I loooove this cream since i&#x27;ve been using it my skin looks way better!</li>
    <li> I love, love this product.  I see a noticeable difference after only using it 2 weeks.  My skin appears much brighter with less appearance of my pores and my skin has indeed tightened.  I have finally found the product that will become a part of my beauty regiment.  I will no longer purchase any other brand from a drug store.  Thank you for creating a product that really works.</li>
    <li> Great stuff at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;very good&lt;br /&gt;very good</li>
    <li> I just finished my first jar of this product and have ordered 2 more.....&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my skin look great. since I have been using it,&lt;br /&gt;many people have commented on what beautiful skin I have.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant and the cream applies smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Great as a night time moisturizer and in the day with or without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;also, it is great value for the price. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t for me.  I didn&#x27;t think it did anything special and did not like the odor.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love it, always work for me.</li>
    <li> Very good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Cream goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin very quickly so you are able to apply makeup and sunscreen over it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer felt nice on my skin but I didn&#x27;t see any reduction of fine lines or large pores. Nice</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 1 month but not seeing much of difference.  Cream is not thick which many times I find those to be watered down ingredients.  Not much change here.</li>
    <li> As the title indicates, I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product.  But I can&#x27;t tell the difference in results between it and much more expensive brands I have used, so I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Have only used this three days but not sure if I want to tolerate the smell much longer. Smells like burning rubber, so much that my husband shoo-ed me away after Made him smell my face !&lt;br /&gt;Just glad I didnt pay an arm and a leg for this...</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing moisturizer.  I use it after applying my serums and it just seals all that moisture in so that my face is truly hydrated in the morning.  I also use it in the morning under my makeup.  It is also great as an anti-aging tool.  It does wonders for those stubborn wrinkles and helps with firmness.  Love it.</li>
    <li> no result yet but like using it</li>
    <li> I did a very long intensive search regarding all of the old and new products that are supposed to protect or correct cosmetic facial issues. There are plenty of articles out there but look for the ones by the dermatologists who are not trying to sell anything. I then compared products - Expensive and NOT - and found these on Amazon with the same identical components as the more expensive ones sold at cosmetic counters or even in (or especially in!) the dermatologists&#x27; or plastic surgeon&#x27;s offices. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product as well as a few others I plan to review today.</li>
    <li> used for one week and see much toner skin..thanks</li>
    <li> just my opinion, but over the counter ROC does better</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I like it so much better than another product I tried by Dr. P.  It feels great on my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and I love the results!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is AMAZING. I realized that I had sunken eye and dull looking skin, plus I needed a nighttime moisturizer. This WORKED. A little goes a long way - a whole jar lasted me through one whole college semester. But be careful - it does get rotten (turns a brown color) and then leaves a film on your face.</li>
