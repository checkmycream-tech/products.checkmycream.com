      <li>It&#x27;s a good thing if you are looking for something to wear at the beach though.  </li>
      <li>a good price</li>

      <li>Love the fullness of the lashes when you apply lots!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mascara!</li>
      <li>It has the perfect thickness, it curled my lashes when I put it on (surprised me), and it makes your lashes look thicker and longer.</li>
      <li>I would say this is a good drugstore mascara, and if you aren&#x27;t willing to shell out upwards of 15+ dollars for mascara, this is a good one to buy.  </li>
      <li>THE MORE I REPEATED PUTTING IT ON,</li>
      <li>keep making it, I love it.</li>
      <li>love the consistency of it.</li>
      <li>This is my absolutely FAVORITE mascara.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I wish the brush was better and it would make lashes shiny dense.</li>
      <li>love the color.</li>
      <li>Used this product for two or more years.  </li>
      <li>I have bought a mascara with the same name as this one that was awesome.</li>
      <li>I buy it every time it is on sale just in case they discontinue it which seems to happen with most makeup products that I love.</li>
      <li>It is easy to remove with a makeup remover.</li>
      <li>It does clump your lashes together a bit, but that is easily fixable with tweezers, or eyelash/eyebrow comb.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and the waterproof formula (haven&#x27;t tried the washable) stays on all day and evening until I take it off.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>Overall I am happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>so my mascara is important to me...</li>
      <li>Genuine product but at a discounted price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard really great things about all the Maybelline mascaras, and I was looking for a really good volumizing thick formula.  </li>
      <li>The package was brand-new and exactly how it would be if I bought it in store :)</li>
      <li>It Works exactly as it said it does!</li>
      <li>However, the brush head is bigger than I&#x27;d liked.</li>
      <li>It dries fast, so if you want to go over with one more application, you need to move fast.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re kind of red right now, and someone at work even said something (guess I was squinting and blinking a lot).  </li>
      <li>Most mascaras I can wipe away quickly, but this one needed actual makeup remover and some scrubbing.  </li>
      <li>Scrubbing my eyelashes with my face wash (from Neutrogena Naturals and, thankfully, mild, because who really wants to rub soap around their eyes?)</li>
      <li>, I HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT MASCARAS</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara, always keep an extra on hand.</li>
      <li>But we always have that one product that we love and fall back on.</li>
      <li>My eyes have been more irritated during the days I&#x27;ve used this than they have been for a long time.  </li>
      <li>The brush looks like it&#x27;s super old</li>
      <li>It makes my lashes look super full and long.</li>
      <li>I much prefer [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Guess they really improved waterproof.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I do not appreciate the brush much</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s really scratchy, too.  </li>
      <li>I do think it holds a curl better than other mascaras because of this quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t swear off all Maybelline mascaras, but I won&#x27;t buy another one from this particular product line, either.  </li>
      <li>but it dries quick enough that you can add to it and build it the darkness/level you want it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>AND MY LASHES REALLY LOOK FULL AND LONG!</li>
      <li>My lashes are average at best and it really does look like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.</li>
      <li>So far I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>Maybelline Falsies makes your lashes look so full and long.</li>
      <li>This makes my lashes look long and full.</li>
      <li>I may never go to a new mascara.</li>
      <li>We will buy any new one or one we havent tried before if it goes on sale.</li>
      <li>I have very light and not many lashes.</li>
      <li>It holds a curl well and goes on smoothly, but dries super fast and makes the lashes feel crispy, without looking full.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone else with thin lashes.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried to take this mascara off, I washed my face with a daily cleanser and rubbed my eyes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive eyes.  </li>
      <li>It took me nearly 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>I HAVE BEEN WEARING MASCARA SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD</li>
      <li>Multiple people have actually asked if these were my natural lashes</li>
      <li>I have pin straight lashes and after I use the curler, this mascara doesn&#x27;t weight down on my lashes so they keep curled up.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you fuller lashes, which is what I was hoping for, it actually is very clumpy, giving the appearance of LESS lashes that are individually thicker.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s about average in its abilities to create dramatic looking lashes.  </li>
<li> , IT WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  </li>
<li> But it isn&#x27;t, or at least there aren&#x27;t any fibers in mine.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i like it but it clumps and i dont like that but it works it eazy to us and it a good price</li>
    <li> Gooooood luck washing this off, even with makeup remover. Sheeeesh.  Guess they really improved waterproof.  Builds up and cakes on. Needs improvement, imo.</li>
    <li> Pretty clumpy and flakes off throughout the day--don&#x27;t even try using it on your lower lashes or you&#x27;ll have serious raccoon eyes to show for it! Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this mascara. It has the perfect thickness, it curled my lashes when I put it on (surprised me), and it makes your lashes look thicker and longer. It does clump your lashes together a bit, but that is easily fixable with tweezers, or eyelash/eyebrow comb. Really good mascara! :)</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara, always keep an extra on hand. I like the dark black and I don&#x27;t wear any other makeup so my mascara is important to me...keep making it, I love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard really great things about all the Maybelline mascaras, and I was looking for a really good volumizing thick formula.  So I tried this, and immediately noticed my eyes itching and watering because of it.  I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive eyes.  The brush looks like it&#x27;s super old, it&#x27;s really scratchy, too.  It is, however, a good brush shape. It holds a curl well and goes on smoothly, but dries super fast and makes the lashes feel crispy, without looking full.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone else with thin lashes.</li>
    <li> Genuine product but at a discounted price. Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara! It makes my lashes look super full and long. I have very light and not many lashes. This mascara makes it look like I have full fake lashes on without the hassle of applying fake lashes. Love it!</li>
    <li> Used this product for two or more years.  Love the fullness of the lashes when you apply lots!</li>
    <li> It made my lashes look longer and thicker. I do not appreciate the brush much but it does what it says..It dries fast, so if you want to go over with one more application, you need to move fast. Overall I am happy with the purchase. I wish the brush was better and it would make lashes shiny dense.</li>
    <li> The package was brand-new and exactly how it would be if I bought it in store :)</li>
    <li> THE WAND IS TOO FLEXIBLE...HAS THE FEELING THAT IT IS BROKEN...AND NOT GIVING ME ANY CONTROL.  IT CAME ON WITH CLUMPS GIVING IT THE APPEARANCE THAT IT WAS LEFT ON WHILE YOU SLEPT OR YOU HAD CRIED.  THE MORE I REPEATED PUTTING IT ON, THE WORSE IT LOOKED.  THE PACKAGING AND THE ADVERTISEMENTS SHOWS THE LOOK ONE WHO USES THE MASCARA WOULD ACHEIVE. TO QUOTE THE PACKAGE...\\&quot;DRAMATIC FALSE LASH EFFECT\\&quot;.  THIS MASCARA DOESN&#x27;T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE FALSE LASHES AND SINCE IT CLUMPS, IT MADE ME LOOK LIKE I HAD EVEN LESS LASHES THAN BEFORE I STARTED.  I AM VERY SORRY THAT I BOUGHT TWO PACKAGES OF IT.  I WILL NEVER BUY THIS MASCARA AGAIN, IT WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  I HAVE BEEN WEARING MASCARA SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD AND I AM NOW 59, I HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT MASCARAS IN MY YEARS BUT NEVER ONE AS HORRIBLE AS THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> You DON´T NEED FALSIES ANYMORE!!! BUY THIS!!!  WONDERFUL!!!  I LOVE IT!  MAKE MY EYES BIGGER AND MY LASHES REALLY LOOK FULL AND LONG!</li>
    <li> I think every woman is always on the hunt for the best Mascara. We will buy any new one or one we havent tried before if it goes on sale. But we always have that one product that we love and fall back on. For me it is Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;I love the consistency of it. It doesnt go on too wet so that as soon as you blink it gets all over your face but it dries quick enough that you can add to it and build it the darkness/level you want it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color. It is the blackest black and the the little fibers attach to the end of your lashes to make them look longer.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer waterproof because I wear contacts and if I rewet them or rub my eyes it doesnt come off.</li>
    <li> Great item. I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> The only mascara that I use, helps me tame my wild lashes and gives them length.</li>
    <li> I have very thin and short eyelashes that point downwards. This mascara holds my curl and lengthens my lashes for an entire day. It does not budge or smudge. It is easy to remove with a makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping my eyelashes would look like, well, falsies. I was so disappointed. This mascara is extremely clumpy. I tried going over it with my other mascara, and I also tried an eyelash comb. Neither worked. Even worse, it&#x27;s not completely waterproof. I tried to get it off with makeup remover wipes and it appeared to have taken it off- until I took a shower about an hour later. I came out with mascara running down my eyes. I much prefer [[ASIN:B001BMLJU6 CoverGirl Lash Blast Volume Blasting Mascara, Very Black 800]] as it has virtually no clumps but still makes your lashes look long and thick, especially if you use an eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, if you came to this mascara looking for no clumps and big volume, you&#x27;ve come to the wrong place.</li>
    <li> excelente producto,  y calidad de primera,  y esta muy bien empacada para el envió, llego el producto en muy buen estado, a pesar de la distancia y el tiempo de envió,  excelente para un regalo y esta a muy buen precio</li>
    <li> If you want long-staying, nuclear blast-surviving, all but permanent mascara, then this is for you. This formula somehow binds to your lashes at possibly a cellular level. The first time I tried to take this mascara off, I washed my face with a daily cleanser and rubbed my eyes. I rinsed and looked in the mirror to find the mascara seemingly untouched. Scrubbing vigorously with Neutrogena makeup remover and scraping it off with my fingernails was the only way to get it all off.  It took me nearly 15 minutes. As for the &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; effect, it does seem to do that, making lashes look impossibly thick. Heavy clumps and slight flaking.</li>
    <li> I have pin straight lashes and after I use the curler, this mascara doesn&#x27;t weight down on my lashes so they keep curled up. However, the brush head is bigger than I&#x27;d liked. I have smaller eyes and don&#x27;t need a big brush head.</li>
    <li> I have bought a mascara with the same name as this one that was awesome. I dont know what was different about this particular one that i got, but it was not awesome. Clumpy to the extreme. I couldnt bring myself to finish the tube. Not for me</li>
    <li> This is my absolutely FAVORITE mascara. I ordered this one time, and have been buying it since. I may never go to a new mascara. This makes my lashes look long and full. Multiple people have actually asked if these were my natural lashes and I told them yes. I love this mascara. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really love this product! It Works exactly as it said it does! I will never buy another brand of mascara!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing makeup for over 25 years and FINALLY have found a mascara that does what it claims it will do! Maybelline Falsies makes your lashes look so full and long. I absolutely love it! My lashes are average at best and it really does look like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes. It is easy to apply and the waterproof formula (haven&#x27;t tried the washable) stays on all day and evening until I take it off. I buy it every time it is on sale just in case they discontinue it which seems to happen with most makeup products that I love. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beginning to believe false eyelash looks will only be achieved with false eyelashes, mascara will never get you there.  I would say this is a good drugstore mascara, and if you aren&#x27;t willing to shell out upwards of 15+ dollars for mascara, this is a good one to buy.  It&#x27;s about average in its abilities to create dramatic looking lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t give you fuller lashes, which is what I was hoping for, it actually is very clumpy, giving the appearance of LESS lashes that are individually thicker.  God forbid you swipe this across your lid because it is very difficult to remove.  Most mascaras I can wipe away quickly, but this one needed actual makeup remover and some scrubbing.  It&#x27;s a good thing if you are looking for something to wear at the beach though.  I do think it holds a curl better than other mascaras because of this quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK product, and I will use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I will not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: if you are having trouble FULLY removing this, try nivea cream.  Leave it just a moment and wipe it off with a cotton pad, works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this.  I&#x27;m not a mascara snob.  I&#x27;ve been just as happy with some $3 mascara from e.l.f. as I have been with some $30 mascara from Lancome (and everything between).  But this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought because &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; was in the name, that this would be a false fiber mascara.  But it isn&#x27;t, or at least there aren&#x27;t any fibers in mine.  That&#x27;s fine, I thought, I could still use it just as a regular mascara.  But this didn&#x27;t do anything to lengthen my lashes, and the only reason it made them thicker is because it clumped them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had to put a lot of this on to actually see it.  I can&#x27;t figure out where it&#x27;s going once it&#x27;s on, though.  I wipe my eyes with all sorts of different makeup removers (Simple pads and Clinique Take the Day Off-saturated cotton squares among them) and there&#x27;s just not very much mascara on the pads/squares when I&#x27;m finished scrubbing.  Scrubbing my eyelashes with my face wash (from Neutrogena Naturals and, thankfully, mild, because who really wants to rub soap around their eyes?) seems to help more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think some of this is going into my eyes.  My eyes have been more irritated during the days I&#x27;ve used this than they have been for a long time.  They&#x27;re kind of red right now, and someone at work even said something (guess I was squinting and blinking a lot).  So that&#x27;s not good.  But somehow, despite all the scrubbing, I managed to have raccoon eyes the next morning.  I don&#x27;t know where this stuff is coming from, but it&#x27;s not very well behaved for a mascara, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t swear off all Maybelline mascaras, but I won&#x27;t buy another one from this particular product line, either.  (Mine was new from a drugstore, so it wasn&#x27;t expired or dried out.)</li>
    <li> was dried out and expired had to toss!</li>
