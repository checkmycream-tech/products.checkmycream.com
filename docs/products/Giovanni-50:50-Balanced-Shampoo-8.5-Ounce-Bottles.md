      <li>a mistake turned into a blessing i was able to finger comb my hair</li>
      <li>As if each strand is now free!</li>
      <li>You aren&#x27;t going to get the suds you are used to, but you will see a notable difference after a couple of uses.</li>

      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>then work into my hair from there to make sure everything is covered.</li>
      <li>I decided to do a healthy hair boot camp and stumbled on this product in an organic coop.</li>
      <li>I just wish there was a bit more in the bottles.</li>
      <li>and I feel like I&#x27;m taking better care of my hair.</li>
      <li>it smells like a spa &amp; makes my morning shower so much better.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>My TWA love this this product.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love the smell too.</li>
      <li>your hair is the best blank canvas with this product!</li>
      <li>Overall I think this is the best hair product I have used and have reccomended it to family and friends.</li>
      <li>I pair it with Giovanni&#x27;s leave in conditioner, and find my hair looks the best it ever has daily.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite clarifying shampoo, and I have tried lots.</li>
      <li>top of this, the scent is just lovely.  </li>
      <li>As you see in the picture here, the product I received from Amazon is more honey-colored.</li>
      <li>Plus, the shine is still there, it really looks great...</li>
      <li>So glad I found this line of hair products; life has gotten better in that respect 😊  </li>
      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>But with this, it feels light!</li>
      <li>This shampoo has helped reduce hair loss, my hair feels healthy even after coloring it and I no longer have to worry about dandruff.</li>
      <li>Did not notice any more moisturizing than any drugstore shampoo.</li>
      <li>Great for most hairtypes but steer clear if you color your hair.</li>
      <li>Great Shampoo for my natural hair!  </li>
      <li>I found it was also a very very good product for younger users with body acne because it doesnt have any product in it that irritates your skin and cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo...love the smell, not harsh on the hair</li>
      <li>I have been on a quest to find the ideal shampoo for the past 14 years or so - and this Shampoo is by far the best.</li>
      <li>If you are like me then you will go through one bottle very quickly.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair beautifully clean, healthy, and easy to style.  </li>
      <li>but it is very mild and more herbal than fruity or sweet, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>I have fine, wavy hair</li>
      <li>This shampoo seems to work fine on someone in my family who has wiry hair.  </li>
      <li>My cousin&#x27;s girlfriend introduced me to this product and it is by far the most amazing shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This shampoo (and the accompanying conditioner) are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I prefer millcreek jojoba shampoo which is also sulphate free.</li>
      <li>but it felt great followed with a moisturizing shampoo, protein conditioner and deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>so I decided it was probably time to check out a sulfate free option.</li>
      <li>I wanted to use an SLS free shampoo and remembered years ago I had tried this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>and it lathers lightly and rinses out as if I&#x27;ve conditioned my hair.  </li>
      <li>My mom is allergic to all brands of shampoo/conditioner except this lls free brand.</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo for a few years, and it is great for my curly hair!  </li>
      <li>I use the Smooth As Silk until I feel I need a clarifying shampoo</li>
      <li>Even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, and burts bee&#x27;s made my hair feel like straw, but this shampoo works best with an occasional V-05 hot oil shower treatment, and a good conditioner like L&#x27;Oreal royal jelly, frutice, or herbal essences will make your hair super soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My cousin&#x27;s girlfriend introduced me to this product and it is by far the most amazing shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up and it leaves your hair shiny with no greasy feeling. You must try it out for yourself to believe it.</li>
    <li> Acts as a clarifying and calming shampoo.  Great for degunking hair and removing access product without the hair and scalp being overly stripped of it&#x27;s natural oils.  Has a soothing-cooling smell that I appreciate.  And it foams and cleans the hair wonderfully.  If your hair regimen is missing a clarifying shampoo I would give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve tried everything from ultra expensive to cheap shampoos and I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.  Got a bargain on a 32 oz. shampoo and conditioner at Costco a couple of years ago and decided to take a chance.  SO GLAD I DID.  It&#x27;s sold in smaller sizes at Wal Mart and Target, but not the 50/50, which is what works for me on my processed hair.  Try it if you haven&#x27;t; you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Olefin Sulfonate seems similar to the word sulfate. Want to know why? Because it&#x27;s another form of a sulfate which is absorbed into the body via skin.&lt;br /&gt;All are derived from one of these three: Coconut Oil, Palm Oil or Sugar. Which ever is used does not change the end product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C12-14 olefin sulfonate (coconut derived) - Also known as alpha olefin sulfonate, this is a synthetic chemical surfactant/detergent and it is often represented as \\&quot;derived from coconuts,\\&quot; but in fact, according to the report HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS by the University of Tennessee&#x27;s Center for Clean Products and Clean Technologies, olefin sulfonates may contain contain traces of benzene, which is a carcinogen or reproductive toxin, and may also release it into the environment during the manufacturing process (as it is created using petrochemicals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation&#x27;s* LIST OF&lt;br /&gt;SURFACTANTS (June 21, 2001), olefin sulfonate is a category 4 surfactant and is NOT approved for use in eco-labelled products. Olefin sulfonate contains 50% or more petroleum derivatives and is not considered to be a readily biodegradeable or nontoxic to aquatic organisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Swedish Society for Nature Conservation is an internationally recognized source of the cosmetic chemical industry for environmental standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the LABORATORY OF FORMULATION, INTERFACES RHEOLOGY AND PROCESSES (FIRP) at the UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES in Venezuela, the&lt;br /&gt;alpha-olefin resulting from polymerization is used as an alkylate in a Friedel-Crafts reaction that ends in an alkyl-benzene. By sulfonation and neutralization, an alkyl-benzene sulfonate of the detergent type is produced at a low cost, much lower than a soap from natural oil and fat origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Like others, I wanted a sulfate-free shampoo without any parabens - enter Giovanni 50/50.  Smells great, is super light-weight and I love how my hair air dries.  But after a week of use, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair color stripping.  I colored my hair two weeks ago and its already showing a red hue which never happened before when I was using Pureology (aka chemicals galore!).  Great for most hairtypes but steer clear if you color your hair.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;ll start out with the pros...  It doesn&#x27;t have and sulfates.  It washes out really well, and leaves your hair feeling very clean and free of buildup!      And now for the cons...  It is very thin and runny, you have to use a lot of it to get it to soap up (but that&#x27;s because it isn&#x27;t full of all those chemicals).  It has a very faint smell, which for some could be a good thing, but I like for my hair to smell good after it&#x27;s washed.  After 4 weeks of use this shampoo and conditioner left my hair dry and coarse I discontinued use immediately and gave it to one of my friends maybe she will have better luck :/ This product stripped my hair of all it&#x27;s natural oils!</li>
    <li> Giovanni 50:50 shampoo is the best shampoo I have ever used. I am very allergic to all the sulfates that other companies put in the first 3 ingredients. Even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, and burts bee&#x27;s made my hair feel like straw, but this shampoo works best with an occasional V-05 hot oil shower treatment, and a good conditioner like L&#x27;Oreal royal jelly, frutice, or herbal essences will make your hair super soft. My hair has never been healthier (less split ends), and I&#x27;ve even been dying it. some say it might leave your hair a little flat, just use a hairdrier with a TINY bit of product for boost like you normally would! your hair is the best blank canvas with this product!</li>
    <li> I get this in the large pump bottles at Marshall&#x27;s for $12.99. GREAT value! This shampoo is great for combination hair like mine that is oily at the roots and dry at the ends. I do not use this every day - I use the Smooth As Silk until I feel I need a clarifying shampoo and then I use this (probably once a week, maybe more if I have oiled my scalp as it removes oils really well). I use the matching conditioner which I am about to review, as well.</li>
    <li> My hair type is fine and mostly straight with the potential of getting more tangled as it grows (oilier scalp but ends get dry and hard to brush out). I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo a few months now and it is great. First shampoo I will probably stick to and continue using (I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo more than once when the bottle was done). I still have to wash my hair every other day since my roots still get oily after sleeping on them for 2 nights but my hair is not nearly as dry, it is more manageable and shiny and from root to end much more consistent in texture and health. This shampoo feels milder than others I&#x27;ve used in the past so I don&#x27;t feel bad washing my hair as often as I do. I do always follow up with a conditioner for my ends and the result is great. Doesn&#x27;t do too much for volume... I&#x27;ve had days when my hair gets super flat after the shower (even with blow drying and curlers) and other days it has magazine worthy volume. Given the randomness, it probably doesn&#x27;t have much to do with the shampoo itself so I am not letting this affect my 5 star rating. :) As someone mentioned, I&#x27;ve had more good hair days than bad.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after reading some positive reviews on Amazon.  I do not regret it.  I wear my hair as a short to moderate length afro, and this shampoo is ideal to wash the hair products out of my hair, so I can get it clean without drying it out.  I pair it with Giovanni&#x27;s leave in conditioner, and find my hair looks the best it ever has daily.  No need to shampoo and rinse twice either.  This is a great shampoo for all kinds of hair.  My multiracial daughter uses it for her long straight hair, and she loves it too!.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I have type 4 coils all types of coils on my head and i haven&#x27;t used a clarifying shampoo since I first turned natural because it turned my hair into a helmet i almost lost all my hair after using everything i own to get my hair some what normal so four years later and my hair looking dull and lifeless and coil up as normal my nail hair professor Ms.Z told me i need a clarifying shampoo i almost died i went to rickys beauty supple and i was floored at all the option but this bottle said hydrating clarifying shampoo i was short on cash a mistake turned into a blessing i was able to finger comb my hair my curls instantly return my hair wash cleaned but not completely strip it even help my flat iron retouine last longer i found my answer to my monthly clarifying shampoo i so happy thank you</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good about this shampoo. After the first use it cured my dandruff and hair loss (I have very thick hair and was losing loads of it, though I never noticed thinning.) Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the lack of lather, it still cleans wonderfully. I just apply the shampoo to different areas of my head (crown, nape of neck, back of head and ends) then work into my hair from there to make sure everything is covered. Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking all SLS free shampoos are similar, I have tried several and I keep coming back to this one. I just wish there was a bit more in the bottles.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would find a shampoo that I like so much. It smells so good, cleans, moisturizes, is organic and doesn&#x27;t break the bank. My hair fall has reduced drastically and I even feel that my hair is growing faster. I love, love, love this shampoo. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo! This shampoo is great for clarifying, but it also does not strip the hair. It leaves it feeling soft, healthy and clean. Because it doesn&#x27;t contain any SLS&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy but once you get used to it you hardly notice. I wonder why they really need to put that stuff into the other shampoos at all. It has a very light and pleasant fragrance, but it def. doesn&#x27;t overwhelm. It smells a tad like apples or something. If you are like me then you will go through one bottle very quickly. I use about 1 every 3 weeks. So you might want to stock up. I think I bought 3 bottles for about $17.50. That&#x27;s a great deal considering that in most healthfood stores and even at Target, one bottle will cost you upwards of $8.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo once and was unimpressed. I decided to try it again and got a little in my eye. I realize we&#x27;re supposed to avoid that, but in the shower, it&#x27;s bound to happen. Anyway, I&#x27;ve used a muriad of beauty products over the years and have never, ever experienced pain like this. I&#x27;m actually worried I may have done some permanent damage. Please be very, very careful with this product.</li>
    <li> My mom is allergic to all brands of shampoo/conditioner except this lls free brand. Thanks God she does not have itchy eyes anymore with this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people who have unbalanced hair...oily scalp and dry ends...I found it was also a very very good product for younger users with body acne because it doesnt have any product in it that irritates your skin and cause breakouts. Overall I think this is the best hair product I have used and have reccomended it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Love Giovanni conditioners and shampoos!</li>
    <li> I have been on a quest to find the ideal shampoo for the past 14 years or so - and this Shampoo is by far the best. One day I came across it at Whole Foods and decided to give it a try - now I am hooked. This shampoo has helped reduce hair loss, my hair feels healthy even after coloring it and I no longer have to worry about dandruff.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this product at whole foods. I have issues with artificial fragrances so this product has worked out quite well. Huge benefit that it&#x27;s good for my skin and the environment as well!</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to work fine on someone in my family who has wiry hair.  However, my hair looks greasy when I use it, so I have had to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few years, and it is great for my curly hair!  My husband recently ran out of his shampoo, and once he tried mine, he started using it too.  It has a nice, light smell and lathers well with a small amount of product.  I often use various other products (mousse, gel, frizz serum), and this shampoo really removes the residue without over-drying my hair.  There are times when I wash my hair multiple times in a day (because of going to the gym or swimming), and I never have had a problem using this gentle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value is comparable to buying it at my local organic store, but the subscribe and save discount gives the edge to buying it online.</li>
    <li> Of course, we all have different hair, scalp, diet, and health which all makes a difference in what will work for you.  For me, this product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost 40 and have no health problems.  My hair is baby fine, mostly straight and fairly long and I have a decent diet.  I also do not dye my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have crunchy ends and my roots tend to get oily if not washed every 2-3 days.  Just a little dab of this shampoo and it lathers lightly and rinses out as if I&#x27;ve conditioned my hair.  After years of use and trimming off the crunchy ends, my hair remains soft and silky. No tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most times, I do not use a conditioner after using this shampoo.  After every other shower, or if I use any hot tools, I use in a pea sized drop of leave-in conditioner ([[ASIN:B001ET78BU Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner, Weightless Moisture, 8.5-Ounce Containers (Pack of 3)]]), and that&#x27;s it.  My hair is shiny, not frizzy, and it flows with the wind like I&#x27;m in a Japanese anime.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of this, the scent is just lovely.  Very light and natural like a faint sweet flower.  You easily get used to the smell and will be pleasantly surprised to receive compliments after a hug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hate the rectangular bottle, but that&#x27;s alright because I love this so much, I buy it by the gallon and use a pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this shampoo maybe 10 years ago. Out of curiosity, I keep trying other products that people rave about like HairOne, Wen, Biolage, Jason, Aubry Organics, and many others I didn&#x27;t bother to remember, but none of the shampoos make my hair feel as wonderful as this 50/50 formula.  I end up giving the other stuff away.  Even the other Giovanni shampoos, don&#x27;t compare to this one.  The wheat didn&#x27;t clean well enough but also made my hair feel dry.  The tea tree felt great, but I didn&#x27;t like the squeaky clean feel and making my hair seem a little wire-like.  The Smooth as Silk was similar to the 50/50, but a little heavier.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I wasted soo much money on hair products and this by far is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used Fekkai (which is great only the first week of use)but after some time, the silicone and harsh detergents started taking a toll on my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried John Master&#x27;s Organics which I keep them second best on my list, but it&#x27;s way too expensive.  It still doesn&#x27;t leave it nearly as great as this one does. I&#x27;ve wasted countless money on hair products and I wish I&#x27;d found this sooner. The reason I spend so much money on hair products is because my hair falls off a lot but I am impressed because this shampoo cleans your hair without drying it out and my hair falls off A lot less with this than any other expensive hair product.  By the way, my hair is very fine, sometimes frizzy, but so far, it&#x27;s been smooth, has volume and well behaved. Plus, the shine is still there, it really looks great... Love it!!! I will be replacing all the shampoos in the bathrooms with only Giovanni&#x27;s 50:50 hair care.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use an SLS free shampoo and remembered years ago I had tried this shampoo.  I remembered there was something I didn&#x27;t like about it but thought I&#x27;d give it another go.  After washing my hair for two days with this stuff it literally fried my hair!  I had very healthy wavy hair, soft full of body, non-chemically treated.  I don&#x27;t understand what could have fried it so badly?    Anyways buyer beware but what confuses me are all the good reviews for this shampoo?  I&#x27;m going back to Pureology which I like but does eventually cause build up on my scalp :(</li>
    <li> I initially bought this shampoo at a Marshall&#x27;s in the large quantity bottles. I have normally dry, kinky-textured hair and I try to avoid shampooing too often as to avoid stripping my hair too often. This is the first clarifying shampoo that I&#x27;ve used that somehow manages to make my hair feel clean (like, stripped clean) and yet still feel soft and manageable. This one is going to become a staple of my household.</li>
    <li> Ok so i just got this shampoo&amp;conditoner based on the reviews and used it right away. I have relaxed african american hair that tends to be slightly dry and thick. I am sorry but i just cant make the claim that this is the best shampoo i&#x27;ve tried. i have been through several different brands in the past from drug store, ethnic store, salon brand and sephora&#x27;s stuff. I just didnt get the magical results the other reviewers experienced. I actually didnt see much difference. I am very picky about that stuff i put in my hair so i really wanted to go organic/natural. I prefer millcreek jojoba shampoo which is also sulphate free.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo that did not contain sulfates since I&#x27;ve become a redhead.  Supposedly that will help the color last longer.  This shampoo cleans without drying my hair out and suds well.</li>
    <li> I recently started researching healthier hair products for relaxed hair. I have always just washed and conditioned that&#x27;s is. As African American its hard to grow my hair and I have always been nice to my mane. I decided to do a healthy hair boot camp and stumbled on this product in an organic coop. I wanted a good clarifying shampoo with no sulfates and boom Giovanni 50/50 worked wonderfully for me. After the shampoo it felt clean and I expected it to be dry but it felt great followed with a moisturizing shampoo, protein conditioner and deep conditioner. My bootcamp regimen was a success and my hair feels fantastic. Giovanni will be my monthly clarifying shampoo. Love this stuff like a kid loves ice cream!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Only issue was that the shampoo had leaked and caused a mess. Thanks.</li>
    <li> For many years I assumed that all shampoos and conditioners were pretty much created equal, with some being more expensive simply because of name and packaging.  I was very wrong.  This shampoo (and the accompanying conditioner) are fantastic.  It leaves hair beautifully clean, healthy, and easy to style.  It is more expensive, true, than a regular drug store shampoo, but it is soooo worth every penny.  And it is FAR less expensive than most other organic shampoos.  Recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> My hair feels so soft and airy now. I used to use Pantene Pro-V and all their lines, but then just decided to switch just cuz I&#x27;ve heard a lot about sulfates being bad for your hair. Anyway, the difference is amazing! With Pantene, I lost a lot of hair while showering, and my hair felt heavy. But with this, it feels light! As if each strand is now free! It also makes my hair shiny, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s cuz of the shampoo or the conditioner that comes with this. Either way, it&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon than it is when I buy it from Sprouts or ULTA.</li>
    <li> My family really loves this shampoo. Since going sulfate free my daughters curly hair is much healthier, my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or as flaky, and my hubby likes it as well. I have dyed hair and since switching to this my color isn&#x27;t fading or stripping. I&#x27;ve tried other sulfate free formulas but they always left my hair feeling greasy after a day. With this im back to shampooing only every three to four days. The bottle sucks, it isn&#x27;t user friendly, and it&#x27;s smaller than a normal shampoo bottle. Shampooing with this takes a little practice, make sure hair is super wet and really massage the scalp. You aren&#x27;t going to get the suds you are used to, but you will see a notable difference after a couple of uses. I only wish I could find a local place to buy:(</li>
    <li> The first time I used this shampoo, I was a little panicked by how dry my hair felt while I was shampooing. Then I rinsed and applied the matching conditioner. I dried my hair to find it soft, shiny, and not at all frizzy. Great shampoo for fine, somewhat dry hair. And it smells delicious-- it smells like a spa &amp; makes my morning shower so much better.</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds a lot but I really like the way it makes my hair feel, nice and free and not weighted down like other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo...love the smell, not harsh on the hair</li>
    <li> I have moody hair. I never know what will happen after I wash it, or even when I wake up. It changes with the weather. For years my hair just looked bad. The Giovanni line, and the 50:50 Balanced even more than the Deeper Moisturizing, is the best I&#x27;ve ever found. I mostly have good hair days now.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair and I like this shampoo because it makes my hair soft and is gentle yet still cleanses. I&#x27;ve tried several sulfate-free shampoos, and had to go back this one. There is a noticeable difference in softness and curl definition even after one use. I find the lather comparable to sulfate shampoos. I prefer nonscented products and hate sweet or strong smelling shampoo; this one does have a fragrance but it is very mild and more herbal than fruity or sweet, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. When I had bought this shampoo locally, it was clear. As you see in the picture here, the product I received from Amazon is more honey-colored. I was worried it was a different formulation or the product was past its prime, but after trying it, it seems to work the same as what I bought in the store. My only change would be with the bottle. The narrow flip top is a bit awkward.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Pharmaca a few days ago - they carry a lot of natural shampoos and this one came highly recommended. I am a picky product person and frequently try new shampoos and conditioners. My hair has been feeling gunked up and my scalp was itching and I was noticing more than normal hair loss in the shower so I decided it was probably time to check out a sulfate free option. This one kept coming up in online searches, and I was skeptical as I thought my hair would feel dried out - but I&#x27;ve now used it 3 times and each time, my hair feels a little better. The 8 inches of hair near my scalp is natural/virgin, and the bottom has been through hell and back. Years of bleaching and dyeing and bad water. I definitely notice some dryness at the tips, but to be honest, it&#x27;s probably time for a trim anyways. The root area feels great and my scalp has had no itching and the hair loss in the shower has already stopped. I haven&#x27;t liked any sulfate free shampoos in the past, but I have to say, I think this one has converted me! I did purchase the matching conditioner and I&#x27;m not that impressed with it, but I also got a few other Giovanni products - the leave in conditioner (which I like) and a pro-vitamin spray (which I also like) and those seem to help with styling and combing. All in all - I think these products are worth the money and I feel like I&#x27;m taking better care of my hair.</li>
    <li> I like it, but nothing special to it. Probably will not buy again. I&#x27;ll try something all natural and organic.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo/conditioner-doesn&#x27;t leave a strange film on my hair. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wrote a note about the fact that the shampoo came broken and had spilled in the plastic bag it was in.  I have not heard back from anyone and wonder why.  It was only 1 of the bottles of shampoo but it spilled all over the other 2.  What do I do with the part bottle of shampoo that I paid full price for?</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended to us by a relative.  It does a great job of cleaning scalp and hair without overly drying them out.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I now ONLY use all natural hair/beauty products, and this brand started the trend. Works better than ANY other shampoo.</li>
    <li> Really did not make a difference in my hair.  Did not notice any more moisturizing than any drugstore shampoo. Don&#x27;t waster your money.</li>
    <li> Seems to have a smell</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo. great price for the 3 pack.  I was glad to finally find it, as the store I purchased it at before  no longer carries it.</li>
    <li> While I like this shampoo, I&#x27;m not impressed with the cost of it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite clarifying shampoo, and I have tried lots. I don&#x27;t buy it off amazon but this is the one i use. I don&#x27;t find it watery but it is very gel like, not creamy or anything, but it lathers REALLY well. I hate when I can&#x27;t get a good lather and this lathers up amazingly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to use a clarifying shampoo and this one works iwthout irritating my scalp. I do use another one (Paul Mitchell Clarifying Shampoo) but that is too harsh for me to use regularly, or even weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get build up, major build up, and this works. My build up is due to both using products and due to hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, i think it&#x27;s kind of like tangerine but I am not sure. I have brittle hair and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I use this on my eight year old who had a really bad allergic reaction to sulfa.  Her hair turns out just as clean and soft as her twin who uses a common product sold at most every store.  Thanks for making a wonderful product that&#x27;s not harmful to my girl!</li>
    <li> Works well for hair volume but irritated my scalp.</li>
    <li> This cleans my locks without leaving any residue. It still lathers even without the harmful sulfates-- and I like that.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo on my natural hair, I use a lot of products in my hair &amp; over time a heavy build up is left on my hair but this shampoo is absolutely amazing, my hair is left streaky clean look and feel fabulous!</li>
    <li> Great product. Cheaper on Amazon than in the store plus when you order from Amazon it come&#x27;s in three bottles. Great results and although it is sulfate free, a little goes a long way. You can&#x27;t beat that. I use it as my everyday (With 1 treatment of the Golden Wheat Cleanse on the weekends) and I love the results.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not dry your hair out or make it feel stripped at all. It&#x27;s best to follow up with a Giovanni brand conditioner like &amp;#34;Smooth as Silk&amp;#34; to experience the best results.</li>
    <li> I heard from a review that this product used Olefin Sulfonate, but I checked both the ingredients in the bottle and in the Amazon ingredient listing and I didn&#x27;t find any... Maybe they stopped producing it with that in it due to regulations. I don&#x27;t know, but just as a heads up, don&#x27;t think (there could be but I didn&#x27;t see any, could&#x27;ve misread) there is any of the Olefin Sulfonate (or something like that)</li>
    <li> Excellent price n product</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo for my natural hair!  My TWA love this this product. A very small amount lather great for me. and leaves my hair clean and product free after two weeks of co-washing. It is making my transition back to my natural black hair easy and it is priced right!</li>
    <li> Really gets rid of all the build up of products without over-drying my hair.</li>
    <li> This was an okay product - nothing outstanding or noticable about it other than it leaving my hair a little hard, but my conditioner got it back to where it should be.</li>
    <li> Gentle on hair and skin. No irritation, like some other shampoos can cause with sensitive skin. Leaves hair clean, soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo. Not only is it cleansing, but it&#x27;s moisturizng too. I stocked up on this and bought a few bottles. I love the smell too. Love Giovanni products because they&#x27;re more organic and natural (paraben, DEA and sulfate free) than some high end salon and store brands. I would definitely recommend this AND the matching conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product really dries out my hair.  I&#x27;m a natural 4b-4c and I don&#x27;t experience any slip from this product and the shrinking I experience is unreal compared to other shampoos I&#x27;ve used that are supposedly be good for the natural hair girls.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for folks with hair types similar to my own.</li>
    <li> Giovanni products are friends of natural or curly hair ❤️ So glad I found this line of hair products; life has gotten better in that respect 😊  All their products work great on my curls!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever! Tried everything else. My hair is fine and though soft, appears wiry and &amp;#34;fuzzy.&amp;#34; This shampoo smooths it over, makes it ultra clean, moisturized and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!!  Leaves my fine hair very shiny and soft without feeling weighted down!!  I first tried this shampoo out of town at a hotel and knew I had to buy it!  Great clean smell.  Use every day and love the results!!  Addendum to Original Review:  February 5, 2017    I STOPPED using this shampoo a while ago because I noticed I was losing more hair than normal.  At first, I thought it was a hormonal issue but as soon as I switched to another shampoo, I NO longer had a problem.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly 2 months and have not been disappointed.  It is an excellent product and will buy again.  Bought it because it is WHEAT-FREE!</li>
    <li> My hair as I age was degrading. I tried the silky formula, but I find this much better. I have long hair and combination hair. This brings my hair super clean yet soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo - scalp always feels good!</li>
