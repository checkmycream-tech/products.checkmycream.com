      <li>this Switch Duo does what it calms to do... easy and fast to clean brushes. &#x3D;^.^&#x3D;</li>
      <li>Thank you for quickly shopping</li>
      <li>You have to use it right away, do not try to clean a brush that has been sitting for days.  </li>
      <li>very practical and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I still wash my brushes regularly but switching between colors is amazing.</li>
      <li>It cleans the brush super clean and ready to use on lighter shades or for blending.  </li>
      <li>I used one of my old hair doughnuts and ran my brushes in circles over the doughnut and it cleaned all the powder off my brushes and i was able to  switch colors without mixing colors or muddyness.</li>
      <li>Takes the pigment right out of my brushes.</li>
      <li>I love this because you can swirl  your brush around this a few times and it is clean!</li>
      <li>It works great, specially when you makeup a buch of people, so you can use 1 eye shadow blender per serson instead aff all my brushes, i love it, what i don&#x27;t like it&#x60;s that it gets dirty fast</li>
      <li>I love how you can use the same brush without mixing colors and giving you a muddy look.</li>
      <li>I just washed this for the first time since I got it and that was 3 weeks ago.</li>
      <li>I really wanted it to work!</li>
      <li>Would purchase again most definitely!</li>
      <li>but I really love the double ended eyeshadow brush.</li>
      <li>I use this for weddings and shows an absolute must have!</li>
      <li>I love this for when I am on appointments with multiple girls!!  </li>
      <li>and it really works!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to go from a black eye shadow to a light color without any discoloration.  </li>
      <li>I love this thing and do not know how I went do long without it.</li>
      <li>Love this for getting different colors of eyeshadow out of my favorite eyeshadow brush without getting my brush wet in the process.  </li>
      <li>This produce really extends the life of a washing since you can get a powder color out of the brush and switch colors in seconds.  </li>
      <li>Much recommended</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>this is great to remove color between applications on all brushes, especially helpful when you only have a couple of eye shadow brushes but are using several colors</li>
      <li>It has made my routine so much easier.</li>
      <li>Very Practical and lessen the use o tissue for color switching.</li>
      <li>You definitely have to clean it right away which adds a little more time to getting ready.</li>
      <li>Edited 2 years later - I&#x27;m still using my original Color Switch Duo sponge thing (I don&#x27;t remember what&#x27;t called), and still have the Re-fill in</li>
      <li>Seriously do not buy this item, its basically a tin with a sponge centre.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It dosnt clean the brush butbit good</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t try it until now but one of my friend did and she likes it , it arrived on the estimated time</li>
    <li> Best beauty purchase I have ever made! Works SO well</li>
    <li> As described, Came on time...would order again.</li>
    <li> Love this for getting different colors of eyeshadow out of my favorite eyeshadow brush without getting my brush wet in the process.  It cleans the brush super clean and ready to use on lighter shades or for blending.  Love this little product so much so that I&#x27;ve bought this little gift for friends.</li>
    <li> I love this thing and do not know how I went do long without it. I used to use paper towels to wipe my brushes off but this works much better. I love how you can use the same brush without mixing colors and giving you a muddy look. The plastic sponge thing can be washed like your brushes but eventually you&#x27;ll probably want to get a refill, I think they are only about $12. I use this everyday and can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> Works great! Great buy and I would recommend to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this product it makes doing my eyeshadow a breeze because I can reuse the brushes</li>
    <li> $24 BUCKS FOR A METAL CONTAINER?? I RECEIVED AN EMPTY CONTAINER. THERE IS NOTHING INSIDE, NO SPONGE NOTHING.!!!</li>
    <li> This has changed my makeup life. Every person that wears makeup needs this. I still wash my brushes regularly but switching between colors is amazing. It removes all the color. I just washed this for the first time since I got it and that was 3 weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I Love this Switch Duo does what it calms to do... easy and fast to clean brushes. &#x3D;^.^&#x3D;</li>
    <li> The best thing invented</li>
    <li> Not too much to say about this product other than it works very well.  I&#x27;m able to go from a black eye shadow to a light color without any discoloration.  I have several eye shadow brushes, now I only use two.  Edited 2 years later - I&#x27;m still using my original Color Switch Duo sponge thing (I don&#x27;t remember what&#x27;t called), and still have the Re-fill in it&#x27;s original packaging.  This was a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has made my routine so much easier. No more cleanng brushes on paper towels or my hand.</li>
    <li> I love this little tool! So glad I took a chance and got it. Takes the pigment right out of my brushes. Love it.</li>
    <li> I loooooove this item.  I like to wear more than one color and hate it when you have to sit there and try to clean a brush before adding the next color.  Its so easy to use.  You swirl it in the little tin and it removes the color from the brush.  Then you apply the next color!  It&#x27;s that simple.  Its not a brush cleaner.  I use it for all dry brushed.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on a wet brush because I use an airbrush machine for my foundation.  Its especially great to use when I switch from contour color to highlight color because you don&#x27;t ever want to mix those colors up.  I love that you can buy it on amazon.  I have previously purchased on their website.  If you haven&#x27;t tried the eye shadow pallete you should.  love the pigmentation and I really love the brush that comes with.  I was skeptical because I only use MAC and Lancôme brushes but I really love the double ended eyeshadow brush.</li>
    <li> On time just as described. Much recommended</li>
    <li> I started using it as soon as I got it, it is just so nexessary!. I really loved this product, it works amazingly and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was ok. I wish I would have not gotten the duo and just got the original. It gets dirty fast. Have to clean practice after each use.</li>
    <li> This a great item. It&#x27;s a must have in your purse. Vera Mona will also help you save time when you are traveling.</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s so perfect, easy to use and clean</li>
    <li> Great quality really works well i love it .. Thanks</li>
    <li> Works well. Gets dirty fast. I feel like it could be sold cheaper seeing that the materials are something I could purchase separately, for less money. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. Will be handy in my kit.</li>
    <li> I will purchase this again</li>
    <li> This was a sweet idea! It helps with a cleaner makeup apllication;) I love it! Would purchase again most definitely!</li>
    <li> OMG this is the best invention ever , I was amaze switching color , same brush w/ no problem I recoment this to all professionals ... 2 thums up .</li>
    <li> The products amazing it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Seems like such a silly item to buy however, I will NOT ever be without it again. Makes it so much easier to keep a smaller makeup brush collection now that I can swap colors mid eye.</li>
    <li> I find it an annoyance to have to wash my makeup brushes because it takes overnight for them to dry and its just a hassle.  This produce really extends the life of a washing since you can get a powder color out of the brush and switch colors in seconds.  Brilliant idea.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I don&#x27;t know how I went this long without it!!  It works great and it&#x27;s super easy to clean.  Genius!!!</li>
    <li> Its okay. It definitely does not clean my sugar pill eye shadows... although they are extremely pigmented. You definitely have to clean it right away which adds a little more time to getting ready. For me the instagram videos I saw using this product were mis-leading. I really wanted it to work!</li>
    <li> very nice to remove makeup on brushes</li>
    <li> Seriously do not buy this item, its basically a tin with a sponge centre. thats all!  if you want to know what the sponge is made up, i will tell you.....ready?? the vera mona sponge is made out of the same material as a hair dougnut, tada!! I used one of my old hair doughnuts and ran my brushes in circles over the doughnut and it cleaned all the powder off my brushes and i was able to  switch colors without mixing colors or muddyness. PLEASE PLEASE try cleaning your brushes with an old hair donought before you buy this vera mona item. youll be so happy that i warned you and basically saved you from wasting your money.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will...removes shadow from brushes.</li>
    <li> Good product. Excellent Job.</li>
    <li> Very Practical and lessen the use o tissue for color switching. very practical and easy to use. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is great to remove color between applications on all brushes, especially helpful when you only have a couple of eye shadow brushes but are using several colors</li>
    <li> Pleasntly surprised at how well this handy dandy little friend works!!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on a youtube video and I had to have it!!! It works so good and it cleans my brushes amazingly! I&#x27;d definitely  recommend this to anyone who wears makeup daily. I think it would be a great product for professionals also!!! :)</li>
    <li> It works great, specially when you makeup a buch of people, so you can use 1 eye shadow blender per serson instead aff all my brushes, i love it, what i don&#x27;t like it&#x60;s that it gets dirty fast and i think it should be cheaper when i saw it in person... looks more expensive in photos than in life</li>
    <li> I love this for when I am on appointments with multiple girls!!  You have to use it right away, do not try to clean a brush that has been sitting for days.  So use a brand new cleaned brush and put it in product and then use this after and your brush is really clean!!  I am doing a tutorial on my instagram page @brandedbytiffanirains check it out</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s awesome the product, I really love it and really appreciate. Thank you for quickly shopping and that&#x27;s great. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love love love!! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Love this awesome tool! I used it for changing eye shadows and even on my blush/highlighter brush.</li>
    <li> This is a MUST buy and DO NOT buy a knock off. I know from reading other reviews that people feel like it&#x27;s such a small thing with a sponge but the quality is absolutley what you&#x27;re purchasing. The tin is sturdy as are the inside sponges. The company that makes these are great people and it works. You gently swirl your brush around and it totally cleans it and ready for new color wet or dry product. The sponge in the middle is for wetting if you need to dip your brush in to wet it. Brilliant. Also this cleans in a snap with out breaking down.</li>
    <li> Pricey.. Good product that does help remove makeup but doesn&#x27;t remove as much makeup as I thought or maybe I&#x27;m not pressing that hard on my brushes. Still works good and I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this for a long time and it is amazing!</li>
    <li> This tool is AMAZING. it works soooo well. I switch from oil slick black to a pure white using the same brush and it really works! It gets all of the previous color out perfectly.</li>
    <li> I had this on my wish list forever it seems like. I was hesitant on buying it. But I must say it was the best decision I&#x27;ve made in a while. I absolutely love this! I can switch seamlessly through dark colors like black or deep purple to use light pigments. This little thing it&#x27;s a blessing!</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best thing since sliced bread, except for a makeup lover/ makeup artist/ makeup enthusiast. I love this because you can swirl  your brush around this a few times and it is clean! It saves me SO much time both when applying my own makeup and cleaning  my brushes. Which in the long run I feel saves on the life of my brushes. And it makes it easier because you can use the same brush and switch colors back and forth during makeup application so that you then only have to wash a few brushes. Or for those of you who don&#x27;t have a lot of brushes then it makes the same brush reusable with out running the risk of getting a darker color where you don&#x27;t want it! I also like that the middle has a spot for water so you can wet your brush for wet shadow application! WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!</li>
    <li> I love love love this!!! I use this for weddings and shows an absolute must have!</li>
    <li> Good and shipping in the time</li>
    <li> Best thing out there for cleaning brushes in my opinion. Great product.</li>
</ol>
