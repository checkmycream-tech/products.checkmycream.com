      <li>FAST SHIPPING GREAT PACKAGING</li>
      <li>but this one has more lemon than vanilla..</li>

      <li>but it&#x27;s more sweet than zesty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering and leaves a nice sweet fresh scent on your skin.</li>
      <li>well worth it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light, sweet and it does have a lemon zing to it</li>
      <li>Too sugary sweet.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for just a sweet lemon fruity scent.</li>
      <li>Smells clean and fresh, reminds me of summertime.</li>
      <li>Long lasting and deliciously scented, I will buy this over and over again.</li>
      <li>Worth the money for me.</li>

      <li>i will continue to order as long as its available on this website</li>
      <li>Lovely lemon scent, but with a twist of vanilla to sweeten it up a little.</li>
      <li>i like the scent because it is fresh and summery, but it isn&#x27;t my go-to fragrance foe summer because I like the scent to last all day, and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t cling to me like I would like it to</li>
      <li>OMG I have waited so long for this scent, Fresh smell Lemon Pound Cake</li>
      <li>I completely forgot about it until it arrived.</li>

<li> well it all depends; the original price is $12.50 and if you&#x27;re unable to buy it at bath and body any longer ( outlets, semi annuals) then as long as the price doesn&#x27;t exceed that</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately the price has increased so much I can no longer afford to buy it.</li>
<li> year round</li>
<li> I hate paying so much for it and at some point the supply will be gone,</li>
<li> Hard to find now!</li>
<li> A little disappointed.</li>
<li> Who smells so good?&amp;#34; I hate that Bath &amp; Body Works eliminated it.</li>

    <li> This body spray is yummy! Smells like lemon sugar cookies! Long lasting and deliciously scented, I will buy this over and over again.</li>
    <li> Loooooove this scent. To me, it smells like vanilla-frosted lemon cupcakes. Whenever I wear it, I have people looking around and going, &amp;#34;What/Who smells so good?&amp;#34; I hate that Bath &amp; Body Works eliminated it. But that&#x27;s why I buy it here. :D</li>
    <li> Lovely lemon scent, but with a twist of vanilla to sweeten it up a little. I really love it and will buy it from now on. Like the name, it&#x27;s perfect for summer.</li>

    <li> this spray is amazing...i hate when they discontinue the best scents..i will continue to order as long as its available on this website</li>
    <li> My mother came home from a doctors appointment and asked me if i had ever heard of this product.Apparently her nurse had been wearing it and she fell in love with the smell instantly. however, I had not. MAN do i wish i would have! IT SMELLS SO GOOD!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Glad to finally find this again...for under $65 (as had been listed on eBay)!?!</li>
    <li> i like the scent because it is fresh and summery, but it isn&#x27;t my go-to fragrance foe summer because I like the scent to last all day, and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t cling to me like I would like it to</li>
    <li> Best smelling Bath and Body works product made, so wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it!</li>
    <li> i love it! At first i was a little skeptical (my first time buying from amazon), but i read the reviews and then bought it! I completely forgot about it until it arrived. It only took about to to three days to arrive as well and i am quite satisfied with my purchase. t smells wonderful by the way. I cant find a scent like this anywhere but on line!</li>
    <li> My favorite BBW scent!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and seller shipped item immediately! Arrived 2 days early and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier about this!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent for years. Hard to find now!</li>
    <li> Great summer scent! It smells like lemon cookies!  I layer it over the lotion for extra staying power. I get compliments all the time when I wear this. It&#x27;s not overpowering and leaves a nice sweet fresh scent on your skin. I also spray this in my hair and on my clothes and that helps it last longer through the day. This is my go to scent in the summer. It also doesnt irritate my sensitive skin, which is very rare for a scented product. Hopefully BBW will bring it back, but until then I will continue to purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my product it met all my expectation. Thqnk-You.</li>
    <li> OMG I have waited so long for this scent, Fresh smell Lemon Pound Cake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped Perfect and on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank u so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy More ASAP</li>
    <li> Nice and, for after bath spray, it lasts fairly well</li>

    <li> Will buy from this seller again. Fast shipping and little extra gift in side. I love this fragrance and was so happy to find it here. It smelled just as I remember the first I got it at bath and body works.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and arrived sooner than when it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body splash and unfortunately discontinued.  I hate paying so much for it and at some point the supply will be gone, but for now I have one bottle to last over a year.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and can&#x27;t find anything to compare.  Unfortunately the price has increased so much I can no longer afford to buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this one lemon/vanilla signature collection! It&#x27;s so refreshing &amp; the smell is awesome I use it year round..I don&#x27;t like vanilla tht much but this one has more lemon than vanilla..I love lemon perfumes/sprays</li>
    <li> Lemon scent but with floral accent. The floral part of the mixture is too much for me and gives me a headache. I was hoping for just a sweet lemon fruity scent.</li>
    <li> I love this lemon vanilla fragrance, it probably will remind you of either lemon meringue pie or a lemon sugar cookie it&#x27;s light, sweet and it does have a lemon zing to it but it&#x27;s more sweet than zesty. I see a lot of people complaining on the price well it all depends; the original price is $12.50 and if you&#x27;re unable to buy it at bath and body any longer ( outlets, semi annuals) then as long as the price doesn&#x27;t exceed that but too much it&#x27;s in my opinion well worth it! If you want a sweet, lovely, summery scent that won&#x27;t let you down then Id go ahead and order it!</li>
    <li> I AM OVER THE MOON HAPPY I FOUND THIS AGAIN!!!  This is my favorite smell I get complements EVERY time I wear it! Guys love this smell!</li>
    <li> My shipment arrived much earlier then expected.  Smells amazing. .... I&#x27;ll be buying again so leave some for me</li>
    <li> Love this smell!! Wish I could get more.when you have something that is so popular You don&#x27;t get rid of it. Big mistake of Bath and Body Works wish it would come back. A asked once and they brought back the lotion 1 summer and I bought 6.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the perfect lemon scent and this is it!!  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  Smells clean and fresh, reminds me of summertime.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way.  The fragrance totally and instantly freshens the air.  Worth the money for me.</li>
