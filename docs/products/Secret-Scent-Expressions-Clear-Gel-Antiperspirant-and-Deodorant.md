      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can still get it online -</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to see them available online.</li>
      <li>I went to the States years ago and discovered this and have ordered it ever since from Amazon, I love this stuff and will continue to use it forever provided</li>

      <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>The 4-pack arrived safely with no damage.</li>
      <li>I am a vanilla fan, and if you are, you will love these.</li>
      <li>I was worried as this was my favorite sent and wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product, been using it for years</li>
      <li>more can a girl want in a deodorant :)</li>
      <li>Their Peaches scent is also really good, but this one really sticks out to me.</li>
      <li>Like this product and the very mild fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Both gel and solid work great, but gel workes better.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand strong perfumed antiperspirants</li>
      <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t make me sweat, and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes</li>
      <li>It is a clear liquid which dries very quickly and goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>This is a great antiperspirant in a scent that I have trouble finding at the store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Secret products for over 30 years and this deodorant is the best ever.</li>
      <li>This thing obliterated the &amp;#34;increased body order&amp;#34; side effect of the ALA, even as I doubled up the ALA again allowing me to reap all the benefits of the ALA at the right dose.</li>
      <li>I do not wear perfume and most of my personal needs products are scentless but the subtle scent is very pleasant and not at all over-powering.</li>
      <li>At first I thought I smelled a candle or an air freshener but</li>
      <li>a more thorough whiff of my underarm revealed that the smell was actually my antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>Sort of comical but sort of neat at the same time.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this antiperspirant at any of my local stores any more.</li>
      <li>I used to use one deodorant that actually MADE me sweat even more than I normally did</li>
      <li>I purchased many different scents of Secret clear gel, and Va Va Vanilla is by far the best scent.</li>
      <li>and she said it performs better than she even expected it would</li>
      <li>I really hope that it&#x27;s never discontinued...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about deodorant</li>
      <li>Dries fast and does not stain clothes.</li>
      <li>and I refuse to get anything besides clear gel, because it&#x27;s the only kind that won&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirts.</li>
      <li>Finally, I was almost finished with the solid and needed to get more.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>(I can&#x27;t speak for the solid version of this; I prefer the gel compared to the other one because it isn&#x27;t visible if I wear a tank top).</li>
      <li>I love secret scent expressions, but this was my first time buying the vanilla sent.</li>
      <li>and I love how it doesn&#x27;t get white marks on my clothing but the antiperspirant part of it only last for a short period of time.</li>
      <li>Even after 5 hours of practice when I was an athlete, it would last the whole day (had it on till practice in the afternoon, go home and</li>
      <li>Works well as far as being an antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Interestingly, I was changing clothes one day and got a subtle whiff of vanilla.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive but with Prime it&#x27;s free shipping.  </li>
      <li>It is frequently out of stock in my local stores.</li>
      <li>I quickly learned a common side effect was increased body order.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this for a while and it is hard to find in this scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about deodorant and I refuse to get anything besides clear gel, because it&#x27;s the only kind that won&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirts. I purchased many different scents of Secret clear gel, and Va Va Vanilla is by far the best scent. Their Peaches scent is also really good, but this one really sticks out to me. It smells absolutely amazing. Now that I know Amazon sells this in a pack of 4, I&#x27;ll definitely buy them when mine runs out!</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking I&#x27;d like something different in a deodorant. The scent was way too heavy for me and I have since starting using one with less scent. Works well as far as being an antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> This deodorant does not work well for me. It smells great and I love how it doesn&#x27;t get white marks on my clothing but the antiperspirant part of it only last for a short period of time. I start to sweat very easily within and hour or so after applying it.</li>
    <li> Fabulous scent and great deodorant product! I&#x27;ve used Secret products for over 30 years and this deodorant is the best ever.</li>
    <li> This deoderant works great and smells great works for 24 hours+. Both gel and solid work great, but gel workes better. Buy this product!!!!![[ASIN:B001JQLNVE Secret Scent Expressions Crystal Clear Gel, Vava Vanilla, 2.7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> I find that this product leaves a lot of residue on my skin which is not easy to remove in the shower.  Very pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This is a well know and good product, I buy it online because I can always get it here. It is frequently out of stock in my local stores.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the vanilla sent.</li>
    <li> Love the va va vanilla scent</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand strong perfumed antiperspirants so I love the vanilla scent. I used this for years but unfortunately our local stores have stopped stocking this scent so I was thrilled to see them available online.</li>
    <li> I went to the States years ago and discovered this and have ordered it ever since from Amazon, I love this stuff and will continue to use it forever provided I can always order it.</li>

    <li> I love secret scent expressions, but this was my first time buying the vanilla sent. It wasn&#x27;t as strong/lasting as the other scents made by secret expressions. I will countiue to by secret scent expressions, but not the vanilla sent.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant works better than any I&#x27;ve used. It does not turn white and it doesn&#x27;t take much to last all day, and I workout.</li>
    <li> Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves no trace of color or residue on clothes&lt;br /&gt;Does not clog up my pores the way solids or creams do&lt;br /&gt;Leave my underarms soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can a girl want in a deodorant :)</li>
    <li> I have always used Secret Solid antiperspirant without any problems. Even after 5 hours of practice when I was an athlete, it would last the whole day (had it on till practice in the afternoon, go home and shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) and it is working miracles for me. I quickly learned a common side effect was increased body order. I ended up cutting my ALA intake by half just because of the body order problem. The Secret Solid wasn&#x27;t working, so I had to apply it twice a day. Finally, I was almost finished with the solid and needed to get more. I didn&#x27;t even entertain the idea of switching to something else even though I had to use the solid twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky for me, I was waiting on a prescription in a pharmacy when I remembered I was finally running out of my antiperspirant (solid) and went to buy one while at that store. I found it strange they didn&#x27;t sell Secret solids. Having no choice but to buy a gel, II bought the Vanilla Scent and thank goodness I was forced into this product switch. This thing obliterated the &amp;#34;increased body order&amp;#34; side effect of the ALA, even as I doubled up the ALA again allowing me to reap all the benefits of the ALA at the right dose. Yayyyy!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t carry it in the stores any more. I&#x27;ve used it for 6 years.</li>
    <li> Like this product and the very mild fragrance.  Can&#x27;t find this in any stores, so ordered it through Amazon.  Less likely than solid antiperspirant to leave underarm white stains ( which are almost impossible to remove).</li>
    <li> This is a great antiperspirant in a scent that I have trouble finding at the store. I&#x27;m glad I can still get it online - I love it! The 4-pack arrived safely with no damage.</li>
    <li> Our local stores stopped carrying this fragrance for some reason.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive but with Prime it&#x27;s free shipping.  It removed the frustration of searching for this to be in stock somewhere.  I love the scent and this deodorant does its job.</li>
    <li> Impossible to find locally and no one can tell me why.  I am delighted to have found it again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent.  I was so happy Amazon had it for purchase.  Works and smells great.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this antiperspirant at any of my local stores any more. I was told it was discontinued! I was worried as this was my favorite sent and wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon and I&#x27;m sure my friends thank you now too!!! I was out of this for way too long!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hooray for smelling great again!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Daughter and she said it performs better than she even expected it would, she&#x27;s very pleased with it</li>
    <li> I used to use one deodorant that actually MADE me sweat even more than I normally did so I switched to this one. It&#x27;s awesome! Smells great, doesn&#x27;t make me sweat, and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes (I can&#x27;t speak for the solid version of this; I prefer the gel compared to the other one because it isn&#x27;t visible if I wear a tank top). Love this product, been using it for years and I won&#x27;t be switching it any time soon!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of decades. I am a vanilla fan, and if you are, you will love these. Dries fast and does not stain clothes.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant. I really hope that it&#x27;s never discontinued...</li>
    <li> Secret Clear Gel products are some of the few that actually do what they say.  They keep you dry and do not rub off on your clothes.  Interestingly, I was changing clothes one day and got a subtle whiff of vanilla.  At first I thought I smelled a candle or an air freshener but a more thorough whiff of my underarm revealed that the smell was actually my antiperspirant.  Sort of comical but sort of neat at the same time. I&#x27;m not used to my armpits smelling like vanilla. Bottom line:  It works and smells good.</li>
