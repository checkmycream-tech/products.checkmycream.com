      <li>- I know you have lots of wonderful products, but this just wasn&#x27;t a winner for me.</li>

      <li>Best eye cream ever.</li>

      <li>And doesn&#x27;t make my face break out - that&#x27;s the best part!</li>
      <li>It probably is the best product that came along.  </li>
      <li>Very good result</li>
      <li>Jafra used to make a really great Royal Jelly eye cream 30 years ago, and you can&#x27;t find it anymore.  </li>
      <li>great for area around eyes.</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>I am allergic to everything, and this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>My under eyes are in great shape, and I use this all of the time.</li>
      <li>It too works great.</li>
      <li>This just works very nicely for me.</li>

      <li>Loved this eye cream.</li>
      <li>it is a great product, and even more so for the price.</li>
      <li>I can see why some people prefer to use it at night, but I sometimes put it on all over my face, and have been complemented that my skin has a very healthy glow to it.</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I love burt bee product!</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I use this cream for years now, and love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very mild and basically non-reactive formula which is great for day and night use.</li>
      <li>It also does a great job of reducing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>This stuff is truly amazing.</li>
      <li>It kind of just sat on my skin.</li>
      <li>Very nice stuff and &#x27;fit for a queen (bee)!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It takes a while to absorb, yet your skin can breath very easily.</li>
      <li>It truly diminishes fine lines around eye area, as well as between eyebrows, lip line and best of all works great on healing lips when they are dry and chapped.  </li>
      <li>I use it faithfully every day and love the creamy texture that hides some lines.</li>
      <li>Perhaps, but when you&#x27;ve used as many products as I have over the years, you know when you&#x27;ve found a quality item, like this Beeswax &amp; Royal Jelly Eye Creme,</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure I tell you that I will NOT buy this product, nor my Skinceuticals sunscreen from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love this creme.  </li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite eye cream for the evening.  </li>
      <li>I can not imagine how many bee&#x27;s it takes...</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t keep this in your bathroom (not recommended for non preservatives cosmetics), be sure to have tissues on your dresser or wherever you use it, it&#x27;s greasy.</li>
      <li>Works like magic.</li>
      <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find this in the stores anywhere, and I really love this.  </li>
      <li>I am really enjoying the Burts Jelly Eye Cream.</li>
      <li>Love it, have used it for years.</li>
      <li>, this eye cream is very very rich and I use it during the day time and night time.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and its nice to have a good buffer!</li>
      <li>The Bert&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Royal Jelly I&#x27;ve used for years and can not find anything that comes close to helping rehabilitate the fine skin  around the eye.  </li>
      <li>My eyes and lips are so smooth in the morning after using.</li>
      <li>I was talking about, grainy and doesn&#x27;t smooth out.</li>
      <li>I rarely write product reviews unless its a product I love, and this is one of them.</li>
      <li>Lapping it up, you skin feels richer and smoother in days, and you can feel good about putting natural products in and on your body.</li>
      <li>This product is especially good for eyes sensitive to regular preparations.</li>
      <li>Great for dry skin around the eyes.</li>
      <li>It is a bit thick, but deliciously so.  </li>
      <li>It means that to be able to use the whole jar before it spoils (it should be in a tube)</li>
      <li>This product is SUPPOSED to have a nice, soft, creamy texture, NOT a grainy oily type texture.</li>
      <li>Amazon was quick to ship.  </li>
      <li>Being a guy&#x27;s guy, I don&#x27;t use too many &#x27;beauty&#x27; products, nor am I too particular.</li>
      <li>It even feels like it&#x27;s working after the first application!</li>
      <li>Like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Almond milk Beeswax Hand Creme, it goes to work and feels like it&#x27;s immediately being absorbed by your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
      <li>I love the way the product works to keep my skin looking fresh and young, however, it is time for me to switch products.</li>
      <li>This is my all-time, long term favorite eye product-ever!  </li>
      <li>The grains are strange because no matter how much I rub it in between my fingers or even put a warm blow dryer heat on it, they don&#x27;t smooth out.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit rich, and I would not say oily, but very moist when you put it on.</li>
      <li>Bottom line, great for keeping skin looking vibrant but not what you are looking for if you have dark circles.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use it very much.  </li>
      <li>, you will see the difference after first week of using this product</li>
      <li>Mostly it just gummed up under my eyes, even though I only used a dab from the end of my finger like they suggested.  </li>
      <li>I only use this at night, but it is my favorite night cream.</li>
      <li>Buy it if you are willing to risk looking like Cher&#x27;s son in Mask.</li>
      <li>years back, which has more aloe vera in it.</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this product</li>
      <li>The Royal Jelly Eye Creme is a balm and it&#x27;s super greasy when you can actually get it on smoothly.</li>
      <li>First of all, I have no idea who writes all of these positive reviews because I could not see or feel any difference with this eye cream.</li>
      <li>Not bad for a forty year old man.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work like I thought it would.  </li>
      <li>This is a very risky product because you do not know if you will be allergic to this bee product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me puffy like some others and actually really moisturizes</li>
      <li>I recommend trying this product by purchasing it somewhere like Whole Foods so that you can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
      <li>Eye creams often feel sticky to me or even sting, and I never see too much in the way of results.</li>
      <li>This product for some reason works very well for me.</li>
      <li>By morning, the skin under my eyes is very moisturized, and lines and wrinkles are nonexistent.</li>
      <li>It is very dense</li>
      <li>Perfect for cold climates when skin dries out.  </li>
      <li>I have incredibly sensitive tissue around my eyes -- I have tried multiple products and needed to use Benadryl and prescription anti-inflammatory creams to combat the effects of many products which I have tried.</li>
      <li>It is hands down my favorite night eye cream.</li>
      <li>I love it that way, but my boyfriend probably loves it a bit less, though..</li>
      <li>Reduces lines and wrinkles better than many of the expensive creams.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly reccommend this product.</li>
      <li>A little goes a log way, and I love to use it on my lips too.</li>
      <li>It does, for me, exactly what it advertises by keeping my eye lids, and general area, moist.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>and they were burning more than usual.</li>
      <li>I wear a bit during the day, as it seems to reflect light, and makes the dark shadows disappear.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff but, MAN, is it expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it morning and night and sometimes during the day.  It will not hurt your eyes at all.  It probably is the best product that came along.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a number of years and will continue.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work like I thought it would.  Mostly it just gummed up under my eyes, even though I only used a dab from the end of my finger like they suggested.  I still had undereye circles and bags.  It was rather thick too and made my make up look gummy.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.  I&#x27;ll just stick with Bio-Oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I&#x27;m 54 years old and guess what?.....I don&#x27;t have those ugly crows feet at the corners of my eyes! Nothing on the market compares to this product. Try it...you&#x27;ll see. It even feels like it&#x27;s working after the first application!</li>
    <li> Some are called &amp;#34;eye caviar&amp;#34;, others have gold in them, and some retail for upwards of $100 for a bottle smaller than this jar of Burt&#x27;s Bees. I&#x27;ll let you in on a secret - I use those other expensive cremes once in a while, but I always come back to using Burt&#x27;s Bees because it&#x27;s natural, non-harmful, seems to produce results for me just as well as those la-di-dah $$$ products, and just FEELS good on my skin: like my skin is actually drinking it in, as opposed to just slathering it on and ending up with it on my pillow in the morning. Like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Almond milk Beeswax Hand Creme, it goes to work and feels like it&#x27;s immediately being absorbed by your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue. Sure, you can feel you&#x27;ve applied something, but it&#x27;s not that artificial feeling on your skin, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s supposed to be a part of your body and your body recognizes it and allows it in wholeheartedly. Flights of fancy in my head? Perhaps, but when you&#x27;ve used as many products as I have over the years, you know when you&#x27;ve found a quality item, like this Beeswax &amp; Royal Jelly Eye Creme, that works, but you&#x27;re not spending the money for words like &amp;#34;caviar&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;gold treatment&amp;#34;. Lapping it up, you skin feels richer and smoother in days, and you can feel good about putting natural products in and on your body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Royal Jelly Eye Creme since the mid nineties and haven&#x27;t found anything out there that compares to it based on my needs and standards. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit rich, and I would not say oily, but very moist when you put it on. It takes a while to absorb, yet your skin can breath very easily. I can see why some people prefer to use it at night, but I sometimes put it on all over my face, and have been complemented that my skin has a very healthy glow to it. Not bad for a forty year old man. They also came out with [[ASIN:B002DMK0FI Burts Bees Royal Jelly Eye Cr?me with Aloe Vera, .5-Ounce Jar]] years back, which has more aloe vera in it. It too works great.</li>
    <li> I started using this last night, and already had to wash it off, as it irritated my eyes to the point of me getting blurry vision. I&#x27;m usually not overly sensitive, but whatever is in this thing is not working for me. I also found this to have a very greasy, heavy feel, making my eyes look tired, which sort of defeats the purpose of buying this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Burt&#x27;s Bees - I know you have lots of wonderful products, but this just wasn&#x27;t a winner for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. It truly diminishes fine lines around eye area, as well as between eyebrows, lip line and best of all works great on healing lips when they are dry and chapped.  It is sticky and concentrated in a small pot, but it lasts a long time.  Amazon was quick to ship.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Hard to take out of jar without getting it on your nails. Not better that other lower priced brands. Did not see much difference on my face from the use of other lower priced face moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to almost every eye cream under the sun--this is about the only one I have found that I can use, and since the skin around my eyes gets very dry, I was getting desperate until I found this product. It also does a great job of reducing fine lines and wrinkles. On the down side, it doesn&#x27;t soak in but stays on the surface, leaving a shiny appearance around my eyes and making it impossible to use with eye shadow. If I were not allergic to other products, I might use this just at night, as other reviewers have suggested. But, given my allergy situation, I use it both day and night and forgo the eyeshadow. Overall, I love this product and I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
    <li> I feel like it&#x27;s going to firm up under my eyes and I like &amp;#34;patting&amp;#34; it on . . . . it&#x27;s a little sticky, but I sort of like the feeling.</li>
    <li> The Bert&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Royal Jelly I&#x27;ve used for years and can not find anything that comes close to helping rehabilitate the fine skin  around the eye.  Other products have given me rashes, no matter how expensive they are.  I hope they keep making this product for  a very long time.  I can not imagine how many bee&#x27;s it takes...God bless those bee&#x27;s and the manufacturer. Keep up the good work.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have no idea who writes all of these positive reviews because I could not see or feel any difference with this eye cream. Second of all, my eyelids got very swollen and I broke out in hives. I had to get a steroid shot as my symptoms worsened. This is a very risky product because you do not know if you will be allergic to this bee product. With all of the other skin creams out there, you can afford to pass on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused. Aren&#x27;t eye creams supposed to be on the soft side? Isnt undereye skin delicate? Well, this cream has been congealed since i bought it. it&#x27;s gritty. I have to rub it on hard for it to get on the skin. I dont want to do that to delicate eye skin! I&#x27;m now using it as a face cream .</li>
    <li> Love it, have used it for years. Long lasting. Great for dry skin around the eyes. Sorry, they have discontinued the product.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite eye cream for the evening.  It is a bit thick, but deliciously so.  Works like magic.</li>
    <li> As described would recommend</li>
    <li> I only use this at night, but it is my favorite night cream. So moisturizing. Doesn&#x27;t make me puffy like some others and actually really moisturizes but some is still there in the morning, which for an night eye cream or face cream I want. because if it completely soaked in while I&#x27;m sleeping it&#x27;s usually not keeping it moisturized all night. I read a couple reviews saying it made them puffy or have blurry vision because it got in their eyes.... Make sure you don&#x27;t put it on your tear ducts as it can get IN your eyes or tear duct and being that is is very moisturizing, Any lotion or oil type substance in your eye won&#x27;t be uncomfortable and can cause puffiness and make your vision seem...blurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update*****&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for years now. It is hands down my favorite night eye cream. NEvertheless. I wanted to make sure I tell you that I will NOT buy this product, nor my Skinceuticals sunscreen from Amazon. As it has a really weird consistency. This product is SUPPOSED to have a nice, soft, creamy texture, NOT a grainy oily type texture. The grains are strange because no matter how much I rub it in between my fingers or even put a warm blow dryer heat on it, they don&#x27;t smooth out. I&#x27;m not sure if during storage/shipping it is exposed to extreme temperatures. I have bought this product at my local Whole Foods for years and even ordered it online and never had this problem. Twice I have purchased this from Amazon (once in September of 2011 and November of 2012 and both times it came ruined so it couldn&#x27;t have been a batch issue. Same thing with that sunscreen I was talking about, grainy and doesn&#x27;t smooth out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product nightly for the past ten years. I am 34, and have no wrinkles under my eyes. I love the way the product works to keep my skin looking fresh and young, however, it is time for me to switch products. I have been devoloping black circles under my eyes which this product does not target, nor does it claim to. Bottom line, great for keeping skin looking vibrant but not what you are looking for if you have dark circles.</li>
    <li> Was that the royal jelly or some other ingredient, but I too developed major swelling around my eyes, and rash on the body where I wiped my fingers after applying the product. I used Benadryl tablets and cream to control it.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the Burts Jelly Eye Cream. I apply before going to bed and in the morning the my area under the eye and lid are moist and soft. The product is thick but without being too heavy. You can almost see it softening the lines around/under the eyes. DNK</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores anywhere, and I really love this.  I am allergic to everything, and this is a great product.  Jafra used to make a really great Royal Jelly eye cream 30 years ago, and you can&#x27;t find it anymore.  They changed it.  This is a wonderful replacement of that.</li>
    <li> I am 54 yrs old. I have just discovered this eye creme. I&#x27;ve spent a ton of money on &amp;#34;miracle eye&amp;#34; creams. This just works very nicely for me. There are no &amp;#34;miracles!&amp;#34; I put a little concealer, than add the Burt&#x27;s bees! Works for me.</li>
    <li> Basically this was like rubbing chapstick on my eyes and left me temporarily disfigured. I&#x27;m pretty shocked about the good reviews. The Royal Jelly Eye Creme is a balm and it&#x27;s super greasy when you can actually get it on smoothly. It kind of just sat on my skin. I have no allergies to anything and have never had a problem with an eye cream. I used this sparingly for about a week. Every night I noticed my eyes were irritated. Then one night I woke up around 1 am and they were burning more than usual. I ran to the bathroom and my eyes were almost swollen shut. They went down a little after I washed my face and used makeup remover several times but remained abnormally swollen for about 24 hours. I even used Benadryl and iced them. I was actually embarrassed to leave the house. My eyes have not been irritated and have not swelled up since discontinuing this. Buy it if you are willing to risk looking like Cher&#x27;s son in Mask.</li>
    <li> Like all eye creams this is a pretty small one. I always wonder if these bottles need to be so small. I get it, the eyes are a small area, but come on cut me some slack. it seems to work well overnight though so no complaints there!</li>
    <li> It is very dense so I don&#x27;t have to use it very much.  It works on my wrinkle around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Nothing else seems to work so well, or so my wife claims, around her eyes. A &amp;#34;little dab will do ya&amp;#34; and it absorbs well, is not greasy, no allergic reactions, and no scent. Very nice stuff and &#x27;fit for a queen (bee)!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Will not run in eyes. Works with contact lenses</li>
    <li> This is my all-time, long term favorite eye product-ever!  It is heavy, but i am older and need a heavy duty eye cream.  Perfect for cold climates when skin dries out.  I wear a bit during the day, as it seems to reflect light, and makes the dark shadows disappear.  My under eyes are in great shape, and I use this all of the time.</li>
    <li> Very good result, you will see the difference after first week of using this product</li>
    <li> Being a guy&#x27;s guy, I don&#x27;t use too many &#x27;beauty&#x27; products, nor am I too particular. I don&#x27;t care what shampoo and conditioner my wife buys, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me what toothpaste brand we use it and I&#x27;m really not particular about my deodorant. BUT... There are 2 products I am utterly faithful to: my shaving cream and this. I&#x27;m a bit older, and I&#x27;m starting to get crows feet around my eyes. This reduces the appearance and is totally natural. I highly reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> Loved this eye cream. Reduces lines and wrinkles better than many of the expensive creams.</li>
    <li> I love burt bee product! I live in WI and winter here is extremely dry and cold, this eye cream is very very rich and I use it during the day time and night time.</li>
    <li> I love this! It doesn&#x27;t absorb well but that&#x27;s something I like about the eye area! When my skin around my eyes gets dry, it worries me that lines will form there! With this, I feel like it creates a nice barrier! I have very dry skin and its nice to have a good buffer! I really love this stuff! It&#x27;s not greasy either!</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Beewax &amp;Royal Jelly Eye cream ever since I discovered it, which is a long time ago. I use it faithfully every day and love the creamy texture that hides some lines.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream.  I have used very expensive creams, which can be great, but I think this $15 cream works as well.  I use as a night cream only as it is a little thick and sticky for makeup.  it is a great product, and even more so for the price.</li>
    <li> Royal jelly or bee wax, I can&#x27;t see how this product can improve my skin if it stays at the surface of my skin...The only moisturizing that it can creates will be due to the barrier it creates. Why not using petroleum jelly? No preservative...Hmmm. It means that to be able to use the whole jar before it spoils (it should be in a tube) I will have to use it on my neck too. I use it on my lips, under my eyes at NIGHT and on my throat to not waste the money I used to buy it. If you don&#x27;t keep this in your bathroom (not recommended for non preservatives cosmetics), be sure to have tissues on your dresser or wherever you use it, it&#x27;s greasy. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive eyes this is not for you.  Created swelling in mine and deep dark circles. Not good at all!</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing. I love it. I apply it at night, after cleansing my face. It keeps the skin around my eyes looking soft and moisturized. And doesn&#x27;t make my face break out - that&#x27;s the best part! I have very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now.</li>
    <li> I love this creme.  I have very sensitive skin under my eyes, yet dry.  This creme is perfect for both issues.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I rarely write product reviews unless its a product I love, and this is one of them. Eye creams often feel sticky to me or even sting, and I never see too much in the way of results. This cream feels so good on, not greasy at all. Not sure if it works for wrinkles or not but I&#x27;m addicted to it.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It&#x27;s very heavy, so I use it at night. By morning, the skin under my eyes is very moisturized, and lines and wrinkles are nonexistent. Warning: You can&#x27;t wear this under makeup. It&#x27;s too oily.</li>
    <li> I live in a very cold place, and this creme keeps my eyes and mouth moisturized and protected from the elements.  It&#x27;s one of the few products that eases that tight feeling I get in my skin when I walk out in negative temps and zero humidity.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream ever. I&#x27;ve tried them all and only use this now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It does, for me, exactly what it advertises by keeping my eye lids, and general area, moist.</li>
    <li> This product is especially good for eyes sensitive to regular preparations. It&#x27;s a very mild and basically non-reactive formula which is great for day and night use.</li>
    <li> I use this cream for years now, and love it! It has a thick, a bit grainy consistency, so some people might not like it, but I use it as a night eye cream, so I really dont care if my undereyes are &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;. I love it that way, but my boyfriend probably loves it a bit less, though.. LOL</li>
    <li> great for area around eyes.Doesn&#x27;t burn or sting badly chapped skin. good product will buy again.  thank you thank you</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive tissue around my eyes -- I have tried multiple products and needed to use Benadryl and prescription anti-inflammatory creams to combat the effects of many products which I have tried. This product for some reason works very well for me. Others with sensitive eyes have said the opposite. I recommend trying this product by purchasing it somewhere like Whole Foods so that you can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you. I use it at night and sometimes during the day -- when they say to dab it on, they mean it -- If you use too much, it will feel greasy. A little goes a log way, and I love to use it on my lips too. My eyes and lips are so smooth in the morning after using.</li>
