      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Tried so many cleansers,  I lik this one it gets the makeup off, easy to use, it&#x27;s clearing up my skin</li>

      <li>and when I ran out of my original supply, I decided to shop online and was able to get this product at a much better price from this supplier.  </li>
      <li>more importantly I have found that it helps with rosacea.  </li>
      <li>The soft fragrance reminds me of a happy childhood memory.</li>
      <li>I am using the cleaner in combination with the Obagi moisturizer and that stuff is great also, actually soaks in instead of staying on top of skin looking greasy.  </li>
      <li>My only cautionary note is that a great deal pours out quickly (much more than I need each time.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews about the smell being too strong.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is always a first spot of research before I commit to restocking my own home stash of beauty products.</li>
      <li>Seems to be fine.</li>
      <li>, it cost me a whole lot more!</li>

      <li>Nice and gentle.</li>
      <li>Amazon definitely has great pricing on this product.</li>
      <li>Well worth every penny to me!</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product at the  recommendation  of my dermatologist at her office.  </li>
      <li>it feels clean but does not remove all makeup.</li>
      <li>Have had good results and have ordered my second bottle.</li>
      <li>It has came quickly.</li>
      <li>it has rosy color &amp; a mild smell which I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it is very gentle and my Rosacea has really improved since I started using it.</li>
      <li>Seems to be a very gentle product - feel clean afterward</li>
      <li>Fabulous, gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>Clear, refreshing and cleans without stripping skin.</li>
      <li>Thought I was having adult acne and tried many products.  </li>
      <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>it was worth a try</li>
      <li>I rarely take the time to review items...</li>
      <li>QUICK DELIVERY used to order from Elite Depot ,prices are higher</li>
      <li>From what I have read online, so many people have had great success with this cleanser, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I also use the topical gel as well as the moisturizer and sunblock which are outstanding.  </li>
      <li>I started using this product first out of the Obagi Rosaclear line.  </li>
      <li>and I bought it from her the first time</li>
      <li>Ive always loved it but its more expensive at a Dermatologists or Day Spa.  </li>
      <li>Used consistently this really works.</li>
      <li>an excellent product that reduces redness as well as pimples and blemishes, however the other products in this line made my face extremely pale.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most products and as I was aging, my skin was dry but until now, I could not find something to use.</li>
      <li>I was paying 3 times as much for.  </li>
      <li>This product came as it stated  which was very efficient.</li>
      <li>I use Obagi  Gentle Cleanser for 5 years</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The cleanser works well and is gentle on my skin, reducing redness somewhat.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>The seller send me Obagi Rosaclear Gentle Cleanser</li>
      <li>An intact barrier is a critical component of the restoration process of rosacea because it reduces excess oil production and improves wound healing efficiency by reducing free radicals and restoring moisture.</li>
      <li>I notice a difference when I use other products in that they often leave my face more irritated.  </li>
      <li>I have also started using a Clarisonic MIA cleansing brush to clean my skin (use only 1 time a day) which I wish I would have bought years ago.  </li>
      <li>She explained that most products like Murad, Obagi, etc don&#x27;t get down into the Dermis of the skin.</li>
      <li>but I am realistic)  </li>
      <li>This Rosa Clear face wash is gentle and works really well.</li>
      <li>It foams very well and makes my skin feel very soft after washing with it.</li>
      <li>It was so good specially since I have a little bit of facial rosechia, but it was sensitive enough.</li>
      <li>My derm is out of nyc and highly regarded.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for rosacea problem.</li>
      <li>The amount of fragrance in this cleanser is so high I broke out in hives once it touched my skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.    </li>
      <li>Eleven active, liposome coated ingredients including retinaldehyde (which has been proven in independent research to be highly effective for rosacea)\\&quot;</li>
      <li>The capillaries (and redness) that are often seen reflect two coexisting conditions; the skin is attempting to repair itself by increasing blood supply to certain areas, and, over time, the skin thins from the excessive inflammation which results in more capillaries being revealed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They send me the Obagi Gentle Cleaner which I wanted but this one instead of being clear gel</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
      <li>It arrived new and sealed.  </li>
      <li>[...]&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Both rosacea and sensitive skin are the result of an overload in inflammation and it is therefore critical to use ingredients that remodel, repair and calm so that skin health is restored.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have very sensitive skin. This Rosa Clear face wash is gentle and works really well. I notice a difference when I use other products in that they often leave my face more irritated.  My only cautionary note is that a great deal pours out quickly (much more than I need each time.</li>
    <li> The amount of fragrance in this cleanser is so high I broke out in hives once it touched my skin.</li>
    <li> Wow. for the past 10 years i had a nasty red tint to my face. it started with my nose, and then my chin, and then spread to my cheeks. i tried prescription stuff (metro), expensive cosmetic stuff (Murad, etc), fancy health store brand (Dr. Hanushka, etc).   this cleanser followed with the lotion - after one application, i walked into the room, and my husband said i looked too pale. TOO PALE! i haven&#x27;t heard that in ages. very happy with this product. give it a try, it might be the ONE.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most products and as I was aging, my skin was dry but until now, I could not find something to use. I came across this product through Vitology - a medical facility. I use this daily on my face in the shower.</li>
    <li> I started using this product first out of the Obagi Rosaclear line.  I was so happy with it I tried the sunscreen &amp; corrective lotion later.  Seems to be a very gentle product - feel clean afterward but the skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry.  I have had less flareups, breakouts &amp; redness since I started using it.  Another bonus, I&#x27;ve always had problems with blackheads on my nose, these are slowing disappearing.  Well worth every penny to me!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is very gentle and my Rosacea has really improved since I started using it. My doctor recommended it and I bought it from her the first time, it cost me a whole lot more!</li>
    <li> As a person who deals with rosacea, I have tried every product on the market.  The Obagi Rosaclear line is the best.  The cleanser is soothing and non-irritating and does a great job of cleaning my face.  I also use the topical gel as well as the moisturizer and sunblock which are outstanding.  The latter two products have a slight tint to them and helps diminish the redness of my skin.  I would not be without these products, ever!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great for redness/sensitive skin. It really works well and it removes all makeup without leaving my face feel dry. I will continue to buy this product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I felt this was too harsh for my skin. I think the mild cleanser Obagi carries is more suitable for someone with Rosacea</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, Obagi Rosaclear Gentle made me breakout with white heads &amp; black heads.  Now I have blemishes from the use of this product.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product at the  recommendation  of my dermatologist at her office.  It works well and when I ran out of my original supply, I decided to shop online and was able to get this product at a much better price from this supplier.  It arrived new and sealed.  Will re-order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I rarely take the time to review items...but when it comes to people who suffer from Rosacea I want to help as much as possible. I should&#x27;ve known better, as i read this \\&quot;foams up\\&quot;. anything that foams up is a \\&quot;no no\\&quot; for moderate to severe rosacea patients. I&#x27;ve been reading up on rosacea and working with my derm since diagnosed 4yrs ago. my cleanser was discontinued a year ago, and since then I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for something comprable. so far dermalogica ultracalm cleanser is the only thing that&#x27;s come close. I read and discussed products from Osmosis skincare. My derm is out of nyc and highly regarded. She explained that most products like Murad, Obagi, etc don&#x27;t get down into the Dermis of the skin. If you are a true rosacea sufferer, versus someone who just wants to reduce a little redness, I urge you to read the below. Best of luck to all of the Rosacea sufferers. :)  [...]&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Both rosacea and sensitive skin are the result of an overload in inflammation and it is therefore critical to use ingredients that remodel, repair and calm so that skin health is restored. The capillaries (and redness) that are often seen reflect two coexisting conditions; the skin is attempting to repair itself by increasing blood supply to certain areas, and, over time, the skin thins from the excessive inflammation which results in more capillaries being revealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Rosacea serums are designed to increase the density of the skin (which covers capillaries) while calming the inflammation and encouraging repair in a non-irritating fashion. The liposomes vastly improve penetration while restoring epidermal barrier protection. An intact barrier is a critical component of the restoration process of rosacea because it reduces excess oil production and improves wound healing efficiency by reducing free radicals and restoring moisture. Eleven active, liposome coated ingredients including retinaldehyde (which has been proven in independent research to be highly effective for rosacea)\\&quot;</li>
    <li> After 25+ years of redness and itchy oil break outs,dry skin patches and general \\&quot;complexion ruddyness\\&quot;, spending who knows how much on various cleansers/moisturizers medical products, antibiotics, metrogel and the whole medical crap Dermatologist push on you, lots of facial burning and irritation, I&#x27;m sorry I just found this product line now.!  WOW  I can actually wash my face without burning and irritation and dryness.  I have not had a single oily nasty patch for 3 weeks now.  My skin is looking actually good right now for me!  I even had a couple people notice also.  It&#x27;s winter here so usually my personal worst time for Rosacea breakouts.  I am using the cleaner in combination with the Obagi moisturizer and that stuff is great also, actually soaks in instead of staying on top of skin looking greasy.  With the price I paid for both items from MED 101 it was worth a try and I will continue to use until they no longer work for me. (I hope that never happens but I am realistic)  Since Rosacea is a progressive condition even though Med&#x27;s really don&#x27;t know what causes it, I am happy for now.  I have also started using a Clarisonic MIA cleansing brush to clean my skin (use only 1 time a day) which I wish I would have bought years ago.  It has not irritated my skin and actually smoothed it out.</li>
    <li> Used consistently this really works.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea, I&#x27;m 58 and have dry skin, this prodect is very gentle and since using it I have had less problems with my rosacea.  I highly recommend it.    PMA</li>
    <li> The only wash that calms my rosacea. It foams very well and makes my skin feel very soft after washing with it. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Thought I was having adult acne and tried many products.  Finally my doctor told me to try this product, and it cleared up in a few days.  Amazing.  Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
    <li> The Obagi Rosaclear gentle cleanser makes my skin much less oily.  I never knew a cleanser could do this.  Smells nice, too, so that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> Have had good results and have ordered my second bottle. The cleanser works well and is gentle on my skin, reducing redness somewhat. I don&#x27;t have bad rosacea but have found many cleansers will irritate my skin, induce acne, or both.  Have not had those problems with this cleanser and it has the added benefit of helping to reduce the slight redness i do normally have.Recommend.</li>
    <li> Clear, refreshing and cleans without stripping skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost two years. LOVE IT. As long as they make it I will buy it. Highly recommend for rosacea problem.</li>
    <li> it is one of the best skin cleaners for roscea prone skin. I have very sensitive skin and the dermatologist recommended it to my daughter who bought if for me as a gift. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out bought it myself. Less expensive that the dermotologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking it would take off all of my makeup, but it doesn&#x27;t. it feels clean but does not remove all makeup. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am a 45 year old woman who has had an esthetician since my 20&#x27;s and everyonce in a while this product is in their stock.  Ive always loved it but its more expensive at a Dermatologists or Day Spa.  Amazon is always a first spot of research before I commit to restocking my own home stash of beauty products.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me about this product and I finally tried it. It was so good specially since I have a little bit of facial rosechia, but it was sensitive enough.</li>
    <li> I use Obagi  Gentle Cleanser for 5 years &amp; I like it. The seller send me Obagi Rosaclear Gentle Cleanser but when I contact them &amp; tole them, they change it for me. They send me the Obagi Gentle Cleaner which I wanted but this one instead of being clear gel it has rosy color &amp; a mild smell which I don&#x27;t like it. I am sure it isn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s fault for color change and smell.</li>
    <li> I have red, sensitive, and very dry skin. Also, living in Texas and working outside for half of my life has not been accommodating to my face because it&#x27;s easily pervious. No other cleanser can compete with this one for the reduction of redness. I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> QUICK DELIVERY used to order from Elite Depot ,prices are higher so I checked with Amazon and saved MORE.  Keeps your facial skin from getting breakouts-use a small amount on a natural facial sea sponge,lathers up for a smooth fresh cleansed face. Use other Obagi products for Roceasa too.</li>
    <li> Tried so many cleansers,  I lik this one it gets the makeup off, easy to use, it&#x27;s clearing up my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does much for the redness or breakouts of Rosacea, but it definitely makes my skin much less oily.</li>
    <li> Good product.Works very well.</li>
    <li> It really works well for facial care and I love the price.  :-)</li>
    <li> Seems to be fine. Just a little bad will do you. Nice and gentle.</li>
    <li> I get this for my husband who suffers from Rosacea and I think it helps.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. It has came quickly. I&#x27;m satisfied. I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;i like this product and i&#x27;m using it all the time.</li>
    <li> Fabulous, gentle cleanser. A very little bit goes a long way, so it last forever.  The soft fragrance reminds me of a happy childhood memory.</li>
    <li> This made my skin (cheeks) redder and made it feel tight after using it.  From what I have read online, so many people have had great success with this cleanser, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t.  My skin is very fair and tends to be dry, and I am now using a cleansing oil with much more success.</li>
    <li> love this product when used alonf with my plactic surgeron&#x27;s recommendation for night cream</li>
    <li> I was paying 3 times as much for.  Purchasing it this way and at this price, I can share with my mother. Awesome deal! Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I purchase this all the time.  Love it!! It is of the very best quality.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will like it if your skin is delicate.</li>
    <li> I am giving the product and ok.  I read the reviews about the smell being too strong.  I think mine smells old (?).  There is a smell but it almost is like perfume that has gone away and now just smells old.  The cleanser itself does a good job in cleaning my face and getting the makeup off, but no difference in my rosacea.</li>
    <li> an excellent product that reduces redness as well as pimples and blemishes, however the other products in this line made my face extremely pale.</li>
    <li> Very pleased that I purchased this product. I will be purchasing this in the future.This product came as it stated  which was very efficient.</li>
    <li> I am useing this in conjunction with the complexion corrector and I am loving both. I hope these products remain available for reorder!</li>
    <li> Best cleanser I have ever used for my Rosacea.  The doctor at the Laser &amp; skin care center first sold it to me but I can get a much better price here.  It seems like the genuine product to me.</li>
    <li> I have used the Obagi Rosaclear Gentle Cleanser for a couple of years and find it is excellent as a cleanser that removes all makeup and more importantly I have found that it helps with rosacea.  Amazon definitely has great pricing on this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with my skin. Drs don&#x27;t know what is wrong with my skin, but this gets the red out. Use it with the Obagi Medical Rosaclear System Hydrating Complexion Corrector. They work great!!</li>
