<li> It works and is not greasy like other anti aging serums I&#x27;ve</li>
<li> When I used it in the morning it never absorbed and I had to wipe it off before I put on makeup.</li>
<li> My skin is tighter than it usually feels, and not greasy at all.</li>
<li> Just gotta get past the smell.</li>
<li> This serum makes my dull skin glow again.</li>
<li> Especially during these brutal cold days</li>
<li> I was afraid of breaking out worse or getting clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great for moisturizing and smells really good. I recommend it for all kinds of face types.</li>
    <li> This is more of an oil than a serum.  I have used a lot of serums and find they typically absorb quickly so you can use morning and night, under makeup or alone.  I used this product several times. At night it lasted a long time and made it through the night but was still on my skin&#x27;s surface in the morning and caused me to breakout.  When I used it in the morning it never absorbed and I had to wipe it off before I put on makeup. I could not tell that it helped with any fine lines.</li>
    <li> What a pleasure to receive this wonderful product for review. It really helps my dry aging skin. Especially during these brutal cold days</li>
    <li> I was excited when I was picked to try this product. I&#x27;m always looking for new serums to try out. This kinda had a funny smell to it, but other than that it made my face feel soft! Just gotta get past the smell.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly and I like the product - thanks</li>
    <li> LOVE how this makes my face feel!!! It has a very pleasant scent, and I usually HATE scented products. It goes into your skin deeply and easily, really moisturizes, yet is not greasy or sticky. I don&#x27;t know how they do it. I even think it makes my face look better, but that may be wishful thinking.</li>
    <li> This serum makes my dull skin glow again. I never thought a serum could brighten up my face but this one does. Very light feeling and not sticky like others, brings back your natural glow. Very satisfied. There is quite a bit in the bottle and it only takes a tiny amount. I am so happy that I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Too oily. Not like other serums that absorb quickly. Used at night and still on my skin in the morning. Used in morning and had to wipe off prior to putting on makeup. Made e breakout.</li>
    <li> This company delivers fsst. Can&#x27;t wait to try this product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my face, but it works so well it makes my scrotum so touchable soft. Though I will warn it was not label for this use.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great facial product for my crazy sensitive skin and have used some of Aya Natural&#x27;s products with great results. My face is so sensitive that it likes to break out like I&#x27;m a teenager or something...but I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s. So when I was offered this Anti-Aging Treatment Serum from Aya Natural for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I had to order a bottle.  I have been using it at night for about a week now with no break outs, and my face feels great.  My skin is tighter than it usually feels, and not greasy at all. Another great thing about this serum is that is smells great!! I can&#x27;t get enough of how great it smells!!!  If you are looking for a really great Anti-Aging Serum, I definitely recommend this one from Aya Natural.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I absolutely love this anti-aging face serum from Aya! I had to try this product right off once i received it so I immediately washed my face and opened the package and applied to my face! I have to say that the oil helps tremulously with dry skin. I noticed immediately that it made my face look youthful and refreshed as well at hydrated. I use this product every morning as part of my routine. It really gives me that extra pep and makes me feel great and refreshed throughput the entire day with baby smooth skin! If you are looking for a facial serum that will help you look youthful and feel radiant then this is for you! The olive oil blend helps dry skin right away and makes you feel refreshed. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs a pick me up and help with their dry face! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> First off, I love skincare that has olive oil as an ingredient.  Olive oil has been proven to be so good for your skin.  Secondly it&#x27;s 100% vegan which means no animal by products were used.  Thank goodness! Best of all, It works well.  It leaves a softness and glow to my face.  It&#x27;s best to use after your toner and before your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I needed something for my dry, winter skin.  This Aya face serum has been a life-saver.  Just a pea-sized amount applied to my face and neck makes my skin feel smooth, silky and hydrated.  It is not greasy at all and sinks into my skin and makes it feel luxurious.  I can&#x27;t stop touching my cheek!  I have also started applying it to the backs on my hands which tend to get flaky and papery looking during the winter.  They feel and look awesome.  I love the fact that it is all nature, as most face creams, serums and lotions sting my skin, even the expensive ones. I experienced no burning, stinging or redness after using daily and nightly for 5 days.  Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> I love this!!!  I am almost 50 and have realized over the past several years that my skin is really starting to show my age, so when I was given the opportunity to recieve this product for free , for my honest and unbiased opion, I was super EXCITED!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a week now, and there is a big difference in my skin.  It leaves it SUPER SOFT, and the best part is that there isn&#x27;t any funny smell to it!&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin so I was extremely excited when picked to review this product for free, in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion.  When I first received it and looked at the ingredients and package, I was extremely pleased to see that it was vegan, since I am a vegan it is very important to me that my products are not tested on nor contain any animal products.  I did have one concern and that was the amount of oil in the product, since I have issues with hormonal acne I was afraid of breaking out worse or getting clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the serum two nights ago and so far my results have been impressive.  My forehead was so dry and it soaked the serum right up and felt so smooth afterwards and my skin glowed.  The first night it took about eight pumps because my skin was soaking it up instantly.  The second night it only took three pumps so its obviously working to restore my skins moisture levels.  My skin looks healthy and feels smooth, I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am 26 I really don&#x27;t have any major lines or wrinkles but I do have some minor lines across my forehead, they were really noticeable to myself when my skin was so dry, since using this serum I have noticed that they are far less visible.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am extremely pleased with this product and intend to continue using it to keep my skin healthy and young.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for testing purposes, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> It works and is not greasy like other anti aging serums I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this serum. I love it. It makes my skin soft and it is great for dry weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this serum! I&#x27;ve seen results in the softness and smoothness in my skin already!! Thank you for making this amazing product!! I am using it in the morning  before makeup and at night with the night cream.  It seems to be evening out my skin tone too!!!  Yep, I&#x27;ll be a return customer!!</li>
    <li> So I have only been using this product for a few days but I have to say I&#x27;m a fan. I have been trying to work on using more natural products in my daily life so it&#x27;s awesome to find a natural product that works great and delivers the promised results. It is not oily like some facial serums and left my skin feeling silky soft and smooth. This is great for anybody who suffers from dry winter skin like I do.</li>
