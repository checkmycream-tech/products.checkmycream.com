    <li> Exactly the same as you can buy in WalMart, but much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Parts were as advertised, and they arrived ahead of schedule.  Good price, too.</li>
    <li> They say that you should replace the foil and cutter annually. I use my electric shaver less than once a week and with the self cleaning kit, I hadn&#x27;t replaced mine in over ten years. After installing these, there was a huge difference. These felt very nice.</li>
    <li> it had several little burs sticking up that scratched my face until I sued it several times. quality control needs a little help</li>
    <li> Just like I was expecting, original brand Braun Foil and Cutter replacement pack for a good price. Waited longer than I expected, but coming from overseas, its understood.</li>
    <li> works great. had to b replaced and does the job:) would recommend to ne one needing a spare part to replace. get it here, quality and prices are wonderful!</li>
    <li> The blade and foil are factory original.  The first shave was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the foil is just as important as new blades.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 8585 and have used it for over 5 years. This replacement cartridge was a perfect fit and gives a better shave than the original.</li>
    <li> I knew it would be a long ship from Korea when I ordered it.  I was hoping for a surprise and it would come quicker.  It didn&#x27;t, but it was well within projections. I ordered three so I will have them when I need them.  I have only tested one, but it works as well as those I have previously ordered from the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order again from same seller again, but I will do it when I open the third of these, so that I am not waiting again, after I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron</li>
    <li> I am not sure if the supplier of these replacement cutter heads have changed there process but my Braun eletric razor does not shave as close as it has in the past.  Perhaps it is me.</li>
    <li> Works well when installed.  Needs to be replaced every 6 months or so to keep peak performance.  Expensive.  Saved some money by shopping carefully.  Item was actually sent directly from Germany.</li>
    <li> Came in  a lot later then said. After checking with sender, he decided to ship me another one.&lt;br /&gt;Following the  day i called, original shipment came in. I right away called them back to let them&lt;br /&gt;know and they were able to stop second shipment. Everybody happy.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you. Denis Lafleur</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement at a great price.</li>
    <li> When I bought the Combination package, that appears to be the only way to have the foil and Shaver Aid Frame work properly.</li>
    <li> They fit &amp; function like the originals</li>
    <li> product works the way it was described</li>
    <li> My Braun had frown very tired with age and these parts gave it youth!</li>
    <li> these items are the same as the ones that came with the razor they work great had no problems a little slow on delivery but that&#x27;s the post office</li>
