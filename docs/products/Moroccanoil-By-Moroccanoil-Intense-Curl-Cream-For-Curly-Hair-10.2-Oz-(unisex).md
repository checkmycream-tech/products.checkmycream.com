      <li>Indispensable item for my wife!</li>

      <li>Have been using Moroccaniol products for many years.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>It gets rid of the frizz and makes my hair look under control and healthy.  </li>
      <li>However, I can&#x27;t say I love this product at all.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and everyone seems pleased so that is why I chose to buy it.</li>
      <li>Great hair product, I love the way my hair feels, it is so soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>I have light wavy hair that curls easily with just smoothing serum.</li>
      <li>a huge difference in breakage and thickness.</li>
      <li>The product is fantastic, I use it all the time</li>
      <li>The curls are well-defined and moisture rich</li>
      <li>Item wasn&#x27;t the original product.</li>
      <li>This product is very effective for curly hair that also tends to be dry.</li>
      <li>I contacted Amazon and received a full refund.  </li>
      <li>I am a true Moroccanoil fan, and use it often.  </li>
      <li>Lucky me.  </li>
      <li>BUT I got to ship it back at my own cost.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a while,my hair is soft and healthy</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>You only need a little bit and it brings a wonderful curl.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling very hydrated and no frizzies!</li>
      <li>My daughter has a higher degree of natural wave and her hair looks fabulous when she uses this product.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, frizzy hair and have been ordering this through Amazon, as the price is cheaper than the manufacture.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t have much scent at all and</li>
      <li>I love that I can get out of the shower, put some Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream into my wet hair and be done with my hair.  </li>
      <li>Not only did I receive the product sooner than expected, but the smell is amazing and it really did wonders for my hair!</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and this product helps tame the frizz and curl to be way more manageable.</li>
      <li>I feel like the supplier dumped out the real product and put old lady lotion in.</li>
      <li>And it does not make your hair crunchy, it stays soft!</li>
      <li>I usually straighten my hair but have been wearing it natural much more now that I have found this product.</li>
      <li>However, when I put this on, while my hair was still wet, used a hand towel to scrutch out an excess water, then used a diffuzer to dry it, it was so light!</li>
      <li>- my only wish is that it came in a bigger bottle because I use it on a daily basis with fantastic results.</li>
      <li>I had made the transition from relaxed hair to natural and I cannot emphasize how hydrated my hair is.</li>
      <li>Worked wonders - curls stayed soft and natural thru day 2 instead of frizzy.</li>
      <li>My hair is not tightly curled and this product worked well for conditioning and holding the curls.</li>
      <li>This all just seems super shady to me.  </li>

<li> This all just seems super shady to me.  </li>
<li> It is a little heavy on the curls, but if you just apply a little bit, the results are that you are going to have a very soft and frizz free hair.</li>
<li> I was kind of skeptical because of the price and the up and down reviews.</li>
<li> This product has made a big different living in a dry climate like&lt;br</li>
<li> did not weigh my hair down at all, my curls are defined, soft,</li>
<li> I have been using it for a long long time and I will definitely continue using it.</li>
<li> I am black and filipino, and I have THICK/COARSE hair with a mixture of loose and tight curls which, if I do not have the right styling product, can leave my hair to be frizzy and dry.</li>
<li> so it goes a long way.  </li>
<li> It was sticky, didnt really do anything productive for my curls but left hard pieces of hair and frizzy other pieces.</li>
<li> My hair has a very slight natural wave to it.</li>
<li> Only need a little.  </li>
<li> (because the company wouldn&#x27;t want any more bad reviews).  </li>
<li> Fluff then go.  </li>
<li> I opened the bottle, and inside was a pink, almost baby lotion substance.  </li>
<li> My thinking was since a few of them said they were sent a product that was clearly NOT Morroccanoil that it wouldn&#x27;t happen anymore</li>
<li> You can use it on wet hair but also use it on dry hair to tame frizz and refresh the curl.</li>
<li> It must be applied carefully so that your hair doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.</li>
<li> and I felt that even though I felt like I used the littlest bit, it still made my hair feel sticky and heavy by the end of the day.</li>
<li> Waste of my $$$</li>
<li> I apply it to towel dried hair.</li>
<li> Not worth the price!!</li>
<li> I have used it in the past I like this product.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a bit pricey to me for a small bottle.</li>
<li> This product is a miracle cure for dry and damaged hair even though it&#x27;s expensive</li>
<li> it down in the muggy Florida heat</li>
<li> Too heavy!!!</li>
<li> I really hate to write this review, but I feel the next person to purchase should know.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
<li> But I was wrong.  </li>
<li> I hate using products like mousse because it makes my curls look stiff.</li>
<li> BUt way too expensive for the disappointing results.</li>
<li> However, that being said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, just not one for all hair types.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought for my niece and she loves it!!</li>
    <li> i have curls that refuse to be tamed. I hate using products like mousse because it makes my curls look stiff. This is like a lotion for your hair that tames the curls. It smells devine and your hair loves you for it and behaves in return. i have bought this product several times and will always come back.</li>
    <li> Only need a little.  Fluff then go.  I always use this in the summer</li>
    <li> I have light wavy hair that curls easily with just smoothing serum. BUT when I applied this to to my hair it felt like I was putting body lotion in it. I feel like the supplier dumped out the real product and put old lady lotion in. Maybe this is for a courser hair type. I read the reviews and everyone seems pleased so that is why I chose to buy it. It did not wave my hair at all, it looks like a grease pit. I will never buy this again. Waste of my $$$</li>
    <li> I have frizzy wavy hair and this product does wonders for me.  It gets rid of the frizz and makes my hair look under control and healthy.  I usually straighten my hair but have been wearing it natural much more now that I have found this product.</li>
    <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work and its smell is not like what I had before!</li>
    <li> Worked wonders - curls stayed soft and natural thru day 2 instead of frizzy.</li>
    <li> Too heavy!!! My hair looked oily and the curls didn&#x27;t form well. The hair felt hydrated though. BUt way too expensive for the disappointing results.</li>
    <li> I love the product. It&#x27;s a good curly cream, my hair still stays curly now. It&#x27;s just a bit pricey to me for a small bottle.</li>
    <li> One of the best products for curly hair. I have been using it for a long long time and I will definitely continue using it. It is a little heavy on the curls, but if you just apply a little bit, the results are that you are going to have a very soft and frizz free hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have very curly hair and this product helps tame the frizz and curl to be way more manageable.</li>
    <li> I love that I can get out of the shower, put some Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream into my wet hair and be done with my hair.  It leaves my hair feeling very hydrated and no frizzies!</li>
    <li> I am a true Moroccanoil fan, and use it often.  But upon receiving this product, I realized something was off about the packaging and label. I opened the bottle, and inside was a pink, almost baby lotion substance.  I contacted the seller and did receive a generic reply about a refund, but several days passed and nothing was done.  I contacted Amazon and received a full refund.  I really hate to write this review, but I feel the next person to purchase should know.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair and have been ordering this through Amazon, as the price is cheaper than the manufacture. It smells wonderful, makes your hair soft and shiny and softens your curls!</li>
    <li> Smells great and reduces frizz. It must be applied carefully so that your hair doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy. I would not agree that it amps up my curls, but it does give you that &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; look. I apply it to towel dried hair. After my hair has air-dried, I apply some again. My hair has a very slight natural wave to it. My daughter has a higher degree of natural wave and her hair looks fabulous when she uses this product.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and took my chances.  My thinking was since a few of them said they were sent a product that was clearly NOT Morroccanoil that it wouldn&#x27;t happen anymore (because the company wouldn&#x27;t want any more bad reviews).  But I was wrong.  What showed up was something else in the bottle.  It didn&#x27;t have much scent at all and what scent it DID have was NOT what Morroccanoil products smell like.  I actually wanted this for the scent so I didn&#x27;t even try it - whatever it was.  BUT I got to ship it back at my own cost. Lucky me.  Not only do I not have the product but now I&#x27;m out ~$7 shipping.  And what&#x27;s up with the picture of the product no longer even on this page?  This all just seems super shady to me.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it from a hairdresser - just shows you get what you pay for sometimes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while,my hair is soft and healthy</li>
    <li> Indispensable item for my wife!</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle cure for dry and damaged hair even though it&#x27;s expensive it&#x27;s worth it. I had made the transition from relaxed hair to natural and I cannot emphasize how hydrated my hair is. The curls are well-defined and moisture rich - my only wish is that it came in a bigger bottle because I use it on a daily basis with fantastic results.</li>
    <li> A good option for curly hair.  It is pricey but you don&#x27;t use a lot so it goes a long way.  It hydrates and holds the curl.  You can use it on wet hair but also use it on dry hair to tame frizz and refresh the curl.</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical because of the price and the up and down reviews. However I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. OMGoodness I am sooooooooooooooo in love! Not only did I receive the product sooner than expected, but the smell is amazing and it really did wonders for my hair! I am black and filipino, and I have THICK/COARSE hair with a mixture of loose and tight curls which, if I do not have the right styling product, can leave my hair to be frizzy and dry. However, when I put this on, while my hair was still wet, used a hand towel to scrutch out an excess water, then used a diffuzer to dry it, it was so light! did not weigh my hair down at all, my curls are defined, soft, no flakes and ONLY had to refresh my ends in the morning. I have DEFINITELY found my product!</li>
    <li> This product is very effective for curly hair that also tends to be dry. I have used it in the past I like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve found it to work the best on my&lt;br /&gt;in-between wavy but not quite curly hair. Helps&lt;br /&gt;tame it down in the muggy Florida heat</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic, I use it all the time but if I knew it would take 3 weeks and 2 emails to receive it I would have gotten elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair nice and full - Love this product!! You only need a little bit and it brings a wonderful curl. Totally recommend it</li>
    <li> Item wasn&#x27;t the original product. I have purchased this before from my stylist and ran low. So I decided to save myself a trip to the salon and buy online. WELL the item came and after washing my hair and applying the cream it smelled different and was the same consistency as my prior purchase.</li>
    <li> Pump doesn&#x27;t work at all. Doesn&#x27;t have the nice scent that the oil has. Not worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Have been using Moroccaniol products for many years. The best for control of curly hair..good bye frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> This didnt work for me. It was sticky, didnt really do anything productive for my curls but left hard pieces of hair and frizzy other pieces. I i prefer the Moroccanoil Curl Defining cream</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for my hair. I would recommend it to anyone with wavy or curly hair. And it does not make your hair crunchy, it stays soft!</li>
    <li> it was a great product and it was a great buy. will buy again if i have a gift card</li>
    <li> Great hair product, I love the way my hair feels, it is so soft and easy to manage. a huge difference in breakage and thickness. I recommend it to everyone.​</li>
    <li> good control and additional moisture</li>
    <li> My hair is not tightly curled and this product worked well for conditioning and holding the curls. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product has made a big different living in a dry climate like&lt;br /&gt;Santa fe, NM. . .I&#x27;m trying everything.  I think this line is the ticket&lt;br /&gt;for me here.  I have curly hair, and it needs lots of this.  I use it&lt;br /&gt;every day.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I absolutely LOVE their moroccon oil and also because it got great reviews. However, I can&#x27;t say I love this product at all. In fact, I used it 3 times and didn&#x27;t like the result enough that I stopped using it and went back to what I was using before. I do have thinner, curly hair and I felt that even though I felt like I used the littlest bit, it still made my hair feel sticky and heavy by the end of the day. However, that being said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, just not one for all hair types. I think it would be much better for someone with thicker or kinkier curls.</li>
