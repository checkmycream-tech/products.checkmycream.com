      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>This Product Ionil-T is by far... &amp;#34;The Best Damn Shampoo for Psoriasis&amp;#34;....</li>
      <li>This shampoo has helped me control flaking from Dermatitis for many years.</li>
      <li>I ordered 3 more bottles - have one on hand.</li>
      <li>Many \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; shampoos turned my hair to straw.</li>
      <li>Be sure to leave it in your hair for about 5 minutes for it to work well.</li>
      <li>She says it performs better than the prescription version her doctor gave her.</li>
      <li>now, my dandruff isn&#x27;t completely gone but it has been greatly diminished in the 3 weeks i&#x27;ve been using it</li>
      <li>Good product, works very well, though a bit pricey .</li>
      <li>Add the quick shipping, and I think we&#x27;ve got a convert for Prime!</li>
      <li>Retired, Now What is funny, clever and witty.</li>
      <li>powerful to kill dandruff, it is always in my home</li>
      <li>Shampoo first, leave it in while you shower, rinse when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
      <li>When I first started using it every</li>
      <li>Even many prescriptions, with no lasting results.</li>
      <li>It has more tar than any of the on the shelf regular shampoos.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m going back and hope I&#x27;ll still be able to get it.</li>
      <li>And it made my dandruff problem much better and it is gentle enough to use it every day</li>
      <li>Its ok but not like the original ionil-t shampoo that I&#x27;ve purchased previously!</li>
      <li>but it certainly does smell like tar.</li>
      <li>The only dandruff shampoo that really works very quickly and efficiently..  </li>
      <li>Ionil T is much easier on my hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried the whole range of products over the years...</li>
      <li>Fast shipper.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>and it is very watery.</li>
      <li>No doubt you will laugh at what the lead character does as he tries to find his way with all his free time.</li>
      <li>have used this for many years ( I started in the mid 1980&#x27;s) &amp; will use no other shampoo.</li>
      <li>Have used this product for years and it is the only one that keeps my scalp feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;But the main thing has always been this:  </li>
      <li>This shampoo came highly recommended to me by someone</li>
      <li>bottom line is i would highly recommend this product and would buy again</li>
      <li>No lather the first time so you must rinse and then lather again - you will get lather the 2nd time.</li>
      <li>No flakes and hair is soft.</li>
      <li>this is the only one that really works.</li>
      <li>If you are near retirement or already retired this book is for you.</li>
      <li>It doesnt lather much, so I use a heavy duty cleansing shampoo first, then this.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for decades and can now barely find it online...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had red itchy scaly areas on my scalp for my entire adult life.</li>
      <li>I have used for years and results are good to control but not totally eliminate problems with bad dandruf.it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used this product for years.  Works very well. Also use a conditioner after using the shampoo.  No flakes and hair is soft.</li>
    <li> It works! And it made my dandruff problem much better and it is gentle enough to use it every day</li>
    <li> Good product, works very well, though a bit pricey .</li>
    <li> Using it for over 50 years.Recomended it to others.&lt;br /&gt;Only product I&#x27;ve tried that solved dandruff problem.</li>
    <li> I can only guess that the reasons this product is harder to find every year is 1) no advertising....anywhere 2) same big ugly brown bottle 3) hefty price tag 4) Hefty fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the main thing has always been this:  It works, and is the only thing that does.  If you have psoriasis or a really dry scalp, this product will keep the itch factor to a minimum and really keep the scaling down.  It doesnt lather much, so I use a heavy duty cleansing shampoo first, then this.  Shampoo first, leave it in while you shower, rinse when you&#x27;re done.  I have been using this product for decades and can now barely find it online...worried that it will disappear altogether.  Will stockpile the last 100 bottles if I need to.</li>
    <li> The shampoo Ionil T is quite good but it is not allowed to import it to Germany! I had problems with the german custom and was obliged to sent it back to the vendor.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has helped me control flaking from Dermatitis for many years. Since I cannot find it locally, I ordered through Amazon.</li>
    <li> best product. have used it for years. gets things under controll within 2 uses. last a long time. grateful to still be able to get this product!</li>
    <li> powerful to kill dandruff, it is always in my home</li>
    <li> The only dandruff shampoo that really works very quickly and efficiently..  Why it cannot be found in stores in the US?</li>
    <li> ..when i use this product!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Other tar shampoos or over the counter men&#x27;s shampoos usually leave residue - this does not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had red itchy scaly areas on my scalp for my entire adult life. (I turned 71 today)  I have tried every shampoo that is supposed to help this condition. Even many prescriptions, with no lasting results. Some would work for a while but the problem would always come back. Many \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; shampoos turned my hair to straw. Ionil T is much easier on my hair. I used it almost daily on short hair &amp; now use it only weekly on my waist long hair. It still dose the job.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for many years ( I started in the mid 1980&#x27;s) &amp; will use no other shampoo.</li>
    <li> i have tried countless other shampoos to get rid of my severe dandruff and none have worked as well as this one has..now, my dandruff isn&#x27;t completely gone but it has been greatly diminished in the 3 weeks i&#x27;ve been using it but then again i don&#x27;t shower every day so i can just imagine what it would do if i showered regularly..bottom line is i would highly recommend this product and would buy again</li>
    <li> Good shampoo and helps with scalp issues.  A little pricey but not out of sync with what it costs everywhere.  Be sure to leave it in your hair for about 5 minutes for it to work well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo takes care of an itchy scalp and helps to prevent dry scalf.</li>
    <li> if you have itchy scalp, this is what you want. also, no conditioner needed with this produce.</li>
    <li> The stuff works but it certainly does smell like tar. I used and and will again ( or from time to time) to keep my itchy head at bay.</li>
    <li> Its ok but not like the original ionil-t shampoo that I&#x27;ve purchased previously!</li>
    <li> IONIL-t:  I have used for years and results are good to control but not totally eliminate problems with bad dandruf.it is the best shampoo of all THAT I have tried.</li>
    <li> I wish I could get it cheaper.  Great product</li>
    <li> Amazing. I keep buying it all the time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo came highly recommended to me by someone&lt;br /&gt;half my age for my scalp psoriasis. I don&#x27;t like how it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;lather up and it is very watery. Not worth the $35 I paid for it at all!</li>
    <li> I was so happy this worked for me! Following the directions fully, I saw results in a week! Thank goodness!</li>
    <li> i guess my title says it all. the product did not work for me but then again i guess results are different with each person.</li>
    <li> I receiced everything in about a week</li>
    <li> This is the best dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and it is the only one that keeps my scalp feeling clean.  Just hard to find at times.</li>
    <li> Ionil&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good product; good to scalp, skin and hair.  I went without it for a couple of months and my scalp and hair showed a distinct negative reaction.  It has more tar than any of the on the shelf regular shampoos.  When I first started using it every&lt;br /&gt;pharmacy carried it...now it is hard to get.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the others this is the only product that works I&#x27;ve been using it for years but thought it was going away so I&#x27;ve been trying others none work so I&#x27;m going back and hope I&#x27;ll still be able to get it.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Very happy with this shampoo&amp;#34; are the words my co-worker used after I ordered this for her. She says it performs better than the prescription version her doctor gave her. Add the quick shipping, and I think we&#x27;ve got a convert for Prime!</li>
    <li> Fast shipper. Good product.</li>
    <li> This product works like a charm. My daughter had severe dandruff and I had her use it for a couple of days. her dandruff is about 50% less.</li>
    <li> This Product Ionil-T is by far... &amp;#34;The Best Damn Shampoo for Psoriasis&amp;#34;.... Period End of Story....  I pray we can keep getting it!  I have tried the whole range of products over the years... this is the only one that really works. I am not blowin&#x27; smoke this you can take to the bank!</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo for years as very effective against dandruff.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I had a serious scalp problem and hated to wear black (even though I loved to wear black) I found this Ionil-T and gave it a try. It was like a miracle for me. After a couple weeks I went back to my regular shampoo and the dandruff problem was never as severe as it had been. I always keep Ionil-T on hand and if I have that itchy scalp feeling I use it. I find that I only use it every 3 to 4 months for a couple days. I have tried regular Ionil (without the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;) but it was not effective.  WOW I just noticed how expensive this is - I ordered 3 more bottles - have one on hand. Seldom need it now but once I feel that itching sensation, I switch to this for 2 or 3 days. No lather the first time so you must rinse and then lather again - you will get lather the 2nd time.</li>
    <li> Retired, Now What is funny, clever and witty. If you are near retirement or already retired this book is for you. No doubt you will laugh at what the lead character does as he tries to find his way with all his free time. Fred has outdone himself with this effort. Loved it.
