      <li>If you know any product feel free to email me at 100852@ameren.com.</li>
      <li>This is my first time writing a review, but I love this product.</li>
      <li>I suffer from full body acne and was hoping this would help.</li>
      <li>I really, really wanted this product to be fantastic.</li>
      <li>For me the outcome made any of the itching worth it.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re suffering from acne like me, it worth trying.</li>
      <li>and then I&#x27;ll get a blemish, but they&#x27;re rarely noticeable.</li>
      <li>Did nothing for me but was worth a try.</li>
      <li>and it works fast, though I probably won&#x27;t be using it for much longer because of the ingredients and the price. :)</li>
      <li>and it was really good for its price compare to the other products</li>
      <li>Three weeks after I finished the first bottle (2 pills, 3 times per day as directed), my skin was a bit more clear.</li>
      <li>My 17 year old son has been using this product for 3 weeks now and we can definitely see a remarkable improvement in his skin.  </li>
      <li>A little improvement in acne condition but really didn&#x27;t notice a great deal of improvement after finishing two bottles as directed.</li>
      <li>This product ABSOLUTELY works!</li>
      <li>Also, about two weeks into the first bottle, I realized I had to take the pills with food</li>
      <li>At first I was to skeptecal, i decided to give it a try out.</li>
      <li>I would say it worked very well for me!</li>
      <li>i tried my first bottle and diddnt see improvements like people had said hey saw in themselves.i</li>
      <li>even taking more at times.i will be sending the product back.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s not totally clear but much much better than before after taking one whole bottle.</li>
      <li>It is very helpful if you have skin problems.</li>
      <li>I really see an improvement.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see results I finished a whole bottle and had ordered another and NOTHING..</li>
      <li>It looks like he is getting his lovely clear skin back!  </li>
      <li>He has tried many other product.</li>
      <li>I sent it back and asked for a full refund from Bell Lifestyle Products.  </li>
      <li>Especially the ones that can cause problems in pregnant women (Oregon grape root, juniper berries) and children (Neem).    </li>
      <li>That does not sit particularly well with me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Here are some useful links about side effects in the different ingredients:     </li>
      <li>Upon receiving the box, I opened the bottle to see SEVERAL capsules empty on the top of the rest.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s definitely something someone should be aware of if you decide to try it.</li>
      <li>I finished one bottle with okay results, now half way through my second bottle-</li>
      <li>you have skin problems, they will probably clear up with this product.</li>
      <li>it maybe clear up some pimples I already had</li>
      <li>and my skin gets really clear.</li>
      <li>and hopefully it will completely get rid of it.</li>
      <li>Getting a teenage boy to take disciplined care of his skin is not something they are inclined to do so having an herbal supplement that performs is really a life saver.</li>
      <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think about the pills, but my doctor told me to think of anything I had been doing new, and these pills were the only different part of my lifestyle.    </li>
      <li>Now, I know that natural doesn&#x27;t always mean safe, but come on--the company needs to inform people of side effects.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m writing a little prematurely since it&#x27;s only been 3 days that I&#x27;ve had ZERO breakouts, but I&#x27;m excited even for a few days of pimple free skin since I&#x27;ve rarely had a completely clear complexion in the past 10 years, and I suddenly developed very severe cystic acne in November.  </li>
      <li>Also, the red spots that remain after the pimple is gone are steadily disappearing.  </li>
      <li>He is getting only one or two new break outs and they aren&#x27;t as \\&quot;angry\\&quot; as they had been.  </li>
      <li>It really worked for me, and after a week I see a big big difference</li>
      <li>but I think maybe it&#x27;s because the product helps with detoxication not sure if it&#x27;s true tho.</li>
      <li>The only other time I&#x27;ve had clear skin was 2 years ago when I consumed a very strict dairy-free, gluten-free, sugar-free diet for 2 months.</li>
      <li>I am disappointed after seeing it have such great reviews.</li>
      <li>All I know is that it&#x27;s worked so far, and I&#x27;ll post again in the future to discuss the long term.  </li>
      <li>A little internet research, and it turns out three of the main ingredients can have MAJOR side effects</li>

<li> Reading the other reviews, I can remember feeling itchy a few times but didn&#x27;t associate it with the capsules.  </li>
<li> capsules are pretty large and smell awful.</li>
<li> This struck me as very odd.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if the capsules are the reason behind it, but that is the only thing I&#x27;ve changed in the past few weeks.</li>
<li> Terrible itching, all over my body, which would turn into huge hives if I scratched.</li>
<li> Desperate to continue improvement, I bought a second bottle.</li>
<li> I recommend this, and to use it for at least 4 weeks, since that&#x27;s the time it takes acne to develop.  </li>
<li> There are also a few questionable ingredients in it which is not okay with me.</li>
<li> NO GOOD</li>
<li> Would recommend it to anyone suffering from any frustrating skin ailments.</li>
<li> But as you can imagine, a diet like that was very difficult to sustain.</li>
<li> I have tried all kinds of products for my horrible acne.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my first time writing a review, but I love this product. With in two weeks, I notice a big improvement to my acne. I just bought a second bottle. If you&#x27;re suffering from acne like me, it worth trying. Thank you Bell!!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for about 2 years now and it is the only thing that has worked. He has tried many other product. I only wish there was a place to get this product on sale.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of products for my horrible acne. After using this product for just 2 weeks my acne went down by 75%. I am going to continue using it and hopefully it will completely get rid of it.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me but was worth a try.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work.  I sent it back and asked for a full refund from Bell Lifestyle Products.  My skin problems stayed the same.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m writing a little prematurely since it&#x27;s only been 3 days that I&#x27;ve had ZERO breakouts, but I&#x27;m excited even for a few days of pimple free skin since I&#x27;ve rarely had a completely clear complexion in the past 10 years, and I suddenly developed very severe cystic acne in November.  I started using this product on May 17th. I finished one bottle with okay results, now half way through my second bottle- I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  The only other time I&#x27;ve had clear skin was 2 years ago when I consumed a very strict dairy-free, gluten-free, sugar-free diet for 2 months. But as you can imagine, a diet like that was very difficult to sustain. It did fortify my belief that acne needs to be prevented instead of treated, since anything topical only ever seemed to only tame my cystic acne. I recommend this, and to use it for at least 4 weeks, since that&#x27;s the time it takes acne to develop.  I do not know however if this product should be taken consistently long term, or if stopping after my second bottle with keep lasting results. All I know is that it&#x27;s worked so far, and I&#x27;ll post again in the future to discuss the long term.  **October 17 2011*** 5 months later and my acne&#x27;s still gone. Every now and then I&#x27;ll get a blemish, but they&#x27;re rarely noticeable. After buying my 3rd bottle, I would take two capsules whenever I remembered in the morning, and then I stopped taking the product all together by the end of August.  Reading the other reviews, I can remember feeling itchy a few times but didn&#x27;t associate it with the capsules.  For me the outcome made any of the itching worth it.  But it&#x27;s definitely something someone should be aware of if you decide to try it. It could be a result of the detoxifying process.</li>
    <li> Impressive results!  My 17 year old son has been using this product for 3 weeks now and we can definitely see a remarkable improvement in his skin.  He is getting only one or two new break outs and they aren&#x27;t as \\&quot;angry\\&quot; as they had been.  Also, the red spots that remain after the pimple is gone are steadily disappearing.  It looks like he is getting his lovely clear skin back!  I&#x27;m actually quite amazed that a pill can do this.  Getting a teenage boy to take disciplined care of his skin is not something they are inclined to do so having an herbal supplement that performs is really a life saver.</li>
    <li> I found this product actually does what it says it will do.  It you have skin problems, they will probably clear up with this product.</li>
    <li> The product just didn&#x27;t work for me, bumps still rose while on the product. Also the products affect my body weired, I became weaker, and heachaches daily. I don&#x27;t know was it just my body or does it happen for everyone. Anyway still looking for a product out there because nothing ever works for me nothing. If you know any product feel free to email me at 100852@ameren.com.</li>
    <li> i tried my first bottle and diddnt see improvements like people had said hey saw in themselves.i took the pills as instructed,to a point where i felt like even taking more at times.i will be sending the product back.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted this product to be fantastic. When I started taking it, I noticed some improvement. Three weeks after I finished the first bottle (2 pills, 3 times per day as directed), my skin was a bit more clear. Desperate to continue improvement, I bought a second bottle. A week into this, I noticed that I was having some constriction in my chest. Also, about two weeks into the first bottle, I realized I had to take the pills with food or I had sour stomach. No biggie. Then, the diarrhea and itching started. Terrible itching, all over my body, which would turn into huge hives if I scratched. At first, I didn&#x27;t think about the pills, but my doctor told me to think of anything I had been doing new, and these pills were the only different part of my lifestyle.    A little internet research, and it turns out three of the main ingredients can have MAJOR side effects (though the bottle itself says no side effects are known): Oregon grape root extract, juniper berries, and neem extract. Some of these remedies should not be taken for more than a week, some three weeks, and some (like Neem) are still very controversial to even ingest. Now, I know that natural doesn&#x27;t always mean safe, but come on--the company needs to inform people of side effects. Especially the ones that can cause problems in pregnant women (Oregon grape root, juniper berries) and children (Neem).    So, take these pills to help, but beware! I think it&#x27;s very bad business and bordering on the immoral for these people to tout the benefits (and not warn against longterm use) of something without also being honest about the dangers. That is why I gave them a 1-star rating.    Here are some useful links about side effects in the different ingredients:     [...]    [...]    [...]</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see results I finished a whole bottle and had ordered another and NOTHING.. the side effects wasn&#x27;t all try just a little itching NOTHING big.. try it out maybe works for you..</li>
    <li> I would say it worked very well for me! I experienced very severe skin disorder and lots lots of acnes! I tried it out because the store besides my work place was promoting it. It really worked for me, and after a week I see a big big difference and my skin gets really clear. Although it&#x27;s not totally clear but much much better than before after taking one whole bottle. I took 3 times a day as directed. The only thing I noticed is that it brings diarrhea at the same time but I think maybe it&#x27;s because the product helps with detoxication not sure if it&#x27;s true tho.</li>
    <li> A little improvement in acne condition but really didn&#x27;t notice a great deal of improvement after finishing two bottles as directed.</li>
    <li> I continue ordering Bell Lifestyle &amp;#34;Help For Skin Disorders&amp;#34; because it seems to help me keep my breakouts more under control. Do not expect this to be a miracle pill that will solve all of your skin problems. It doesn&#x27;t work like that but I do believe it works differently for everyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works well very quickly providing relief from many skin problems. Would recommend it to anyone suffering from any frustrating skin ailments.</li>
    <li> At first I was to skeptecal, i decided to give it a try out. And i notice the clearance of my skin on body This product will WORK! Is if you put an effort on time to this. Additional tips to this DRINK a lots a lots of water. I&#x27;m lookin&#x27; forward to order 2 bottles soon!!</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin!!!!!! Ever!</li>
    <li> NO GOOD IT DONT WORKING WITH ME</li>
    <li> This works ! Does not cause adverse  reaction. It is very helpful if you have skin problems. I really see an improvement.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about two weeks and most of my acne is cleared. However, I do have some issues with it. My hair has become really dry and brittle. I&#x27;m not sure if the capsules are the reason behind it, but that is the only thing I&#x27;ve changed in the past few weeks. Also, I don&#x27;t like that I have to take it so often to get the results I want. They should add more capsules to the bottle if they want you to take so many for it to work. There are also a few questionable ingredients in it which is not okay with me. But I do like that it works well and it works fast, though I probably won&#x27;t be using it for much longer because of the ingredients and the price. :)</li>
    <li> The product did not clear my ache it maybe clear up some pimples I already had and I took lik 6 or 4 pills a day and I didnt see great results.</li>
    <li> After hearing many good reviews about this product I decided to give it a try. I suffer from full body acne and was hoping this would help. Upon receiving the box, I opened the bottle to see SEVERAL capsules empty on the top of the rest. This struck me as very odd. To see one, maybe. But several? That does not sit particularly well with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The capsules are pretty large and smell awful. But, who is to say all things worthwhile have to be perfect in every way? Despite my unease at the empt capsules I found I still wanted to try this. After trying them I found it leaves an almost unbearable after taste in my mouth that lingers even after I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get over the taste and the smell. I am disappointed after seeing it have such great reviews. The box says they will refund the price of the bottle if you are unsatisfied, and I am going to try that.</li>
    <li> My husband suffered with excema. This product ABSOLUTELY works! We will continue using it.</li>
    <li> i love this and it cleared my skin and it was really good for its price compare to the other products</li>
    <li> I love this products. This works 100x better than the dermatologist...I have recommended it 2 over 20 people almost all of them have tried it and continue 2 use it..love it</li>
</ol>
