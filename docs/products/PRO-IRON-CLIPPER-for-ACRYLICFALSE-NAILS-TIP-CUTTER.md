<li> finally received it after so long and its broken do not buy its cheaply made</li>
<li> No major complaints here</li>
<li> It cuts a wide range of sizes, and angling the clipper gives a different tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I have long acrylic tips</li>
<li> Every time I tried to clip my fake nail the metal rounded arch looking thing kept coming off tha whole clipper!!!</li>
<li> and you have to jiggle it or pull the handles outword to get the blade to slide back down.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s PINK:</li>
<li> However this nail clipper only requiters one, saving me time, making less of a mess.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just the actually razor that cuts the tips is a little dull and has to be done a couple times before it actually gets through.</li>
<li> I also noticed that with this nail clipper there is less stress on the nails</li>
<li> have little to no complaints about this nail clipper.</li>
<li> It is a tad bit stiff</li>
<li> Ill change my review once I actually put it to the test!</li>
<li> A complete waste of money!!!!!!</li>
<li> I started getting into nail art, but had no good way to cut my false and acrylic nails.</li>
<li> Bad shape, and quality</li>
<li> Personally hate the way it feels.</li>
<li> This was completely terrible!!!!!</li>

    <li> I started getting into nail art, but had no good way to cut my false and acrylic nails. The nail clipper used for my real nail was to short and required multiple clips, a messy time consuming task. However this nail clipper only requiters one, saving me time, making less of a mess. I also noticed that with this nail clipper there is less stress on the nails so they don&#x27;t break. It cuts a wide range of sizes, and angling the clipper gives a different tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have little to no complaints about this nail clipper. My only problem with it is I don&#x27;t like holding it. I am new to the whole thing, so maybe its me, however I do not like the feel of this style clipper, compared to the traditional clippers I&#x27;m used to. I also feel like I have a good grip, but I am holding them wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light but sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Different tips styles with one clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Strong spring/coil.&lt;br /&gt;Feel like it will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;Over all a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I Personally hate the way it feels.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap cheap cheap. On first five nails, it kept sticking in the up position. On nail six it BROKE! I tried to put it back together, but it will not work. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> it is a perfect tool to cut your nails</li>
    <li> these cutters are a must. when you do you nails as much as I do, i don&#x27;t know what i did without them. Apply your nails and cut to length, lightly file smooth,polish and go. great product.</li>
    <li> This item wasn&#x27;t the one on the pics plus it says new but it wasn&#x27;t and it was not working !!!!</li>
    <li> This pair of clippers worked as it was supposed to. I just don&#x27;t know if I would buy a second one. It has a tendency to get rusty very quickly if left in a humid room like a bathroom.</li>
    <li> Seems a little fragile compared to others I&#x27;ve used, but works great and does the job. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Each acrylic cut is perfect with this tool and I would not want to be caught without it. Thanks for such a great tool. I always wondered where to by them from, now I know!</li>
    <li> It cuts good, but it is cheaply made it seem because it gets stuck in the up position when you squeeze it to trim the nail and you have to jiggle it or pull the handles outword to get the blade to slide back down. Kind of a hassle.</li>
    <li> broke after 2-3 uses!!</li>
    <li> Items were as expected and at a great price. It was packed well and it also gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Product worked just O K.  Didn&#x27;t always cut evenly or on the first try but they did work.  But, what can you really expect for the price.  You get what you pay for and that&#x27;s alright with me.</li>
    <li> Bad shape, and quality</li>
    <li> I got mine a few days ago which makes me happy since the estimated delivery date was until may! its really gentle on tips but maybe cause I didnt have the tip on my nail itself. Ill change my review once I actually put it to the test! Happy as of now</li>
    <li> Bought it on March 2012 and it&#x27;s still holding up strong. It is a tad bit stiff I will admit but other than that Packaging was in good condition, No major complaints here</li>
    <li> Just used these and they are super sharp.They came quickly. Buying a back up pair. Wish They them in my favorite color I have a dislike for pink but a stronger like for the price lol</li>
    <li> This was completely terrible!!!!! A complete waste of money!!!!!! Every time I tried to clip my fake nail the metal rounded arch looking thing kept coming off tha whole clipper!!! I&#x27;ll never buy again</li>
    <li> Came in time, looks just like picture. It&#x27;s just the actually razor that cuts the tips is a little dull and has to be done a couple times before it actually gets through. Had to cut the nails a little longer and file them a lot more because of the raged ends.</li>
    <li> These broke right after I received them.. Maybe I received a dud? Oh well</li>
    <li> Great product. Works just as advertised and I haven&#x27;t had problems with it yet. Would recommend to others. Love the grip on it. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> finally received it after so long and its broken do not buy its cheaply made I did t even get to use it!</li>
    <li> this cutter cuts really good and it&#x27;s PINK:D i really like it; it&#x27;s not heavy and it&#x27;s not too big, it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> I have long acrylic tips and I go through phases where I just want to cut my nails and get the acrylic off so that my nails can breathe. This was perfect for quickly cutting my nails! It was painless and accurate. The only thing I think people should know is that if you want a really close cut, it won&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s set up so that it can cut safely. Other than that, this clipper is amazing.</li>
    <li> I purchased these while in school and still use them today... great product for the money...would purchased again and would recommend it  to anyone...</li>
