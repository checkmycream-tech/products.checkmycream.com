<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product may be &#x27;mineral based&#x27;, but it contains parabens.</li>
    <li> Just love these colors they are perfect for fall and winter the pigment on them is great they don&#x27;t break as easy and it last.</li>
    <li> Great quality palette and beautiful colors you can wear every day.  I really enjoy Sleek makeup brand!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping, great pigmentation and it lasts all day !</li>
    <li> I only use a few of the colors as eyeliner and brow filler but love it! Last all day.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. As others have claimed, yes the colors are very &amp;#34;pigminted&amp;#34; meaning that you don&#x27;t need a lot of powder to distribute the eyeshadow. I have doubled the brown matted eyeshadow as an eyebrow powder a few times. It works really well since, again, it&#x27;s so pigmented. However, a couple drawbacks to consider:&lt;br /&gt; 1) The lighter colors are NOT very pigmented. The lighter colors are almost useless to me. However, there ARE lighter colors that have this shimmer/sheen to them that are very beautiful and show very well, but the lighter, matted ones- forget it; they&#x27;re useless to me.&lt;br /&gt; 2) My biggest pet peeve of any makeup product is when the hinge breaks off from the backing of the product. In other words, the plastic broke off from the back, and now I have to manually assemble the top and bottom pieces together. Very annoying. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m rough with my items, but I&#x27;d say that this problem occurs with 4/5 products I buy.</li>
    <li> The colors are lovely, I am happy with the quality of the eyeshadow and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadow. The color goes on so easily and smoothly. New favorite eyeshadow kit.</li>
    <li> The colors are a little different than picture.</li>
    <li> Super pigmented! For the price it blows high end paletes out of the water! A little fall out but not much and they blend well. I was really impressed. Same for the blush! With continue to try more of the products!</li>
    <li> Lovely neutral palette. The colours are bold yet not too overbearing. The formula is smooth and easy to apply. Would highly recommend purchasing, great value!</li>
    <li> Love all the colors! You can make some great combinations with this palette. Pigmentation is great.</li>
    <li> I love this palette !!!  Its my new go to palette and a lot of my clients love it also. The color payoff is awesome, its highly pigmented and long lasting. It really looks like a high end brand, (and its better than a lot of high end palletes i have) i will repurchase, in the near future. This is A+++++ stuff.</li>
    <li> Wow! The product is great!  And the price!  Can&#x27;t beat it! And they shipped it to me with everything in tack.  I am happy with the it all . Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a much larger palette I have that is full of colors I never use. I absolutely love this one! The colors are so very beautiful and pigmented, and I each one looks great on. I also really love that I can finally pack my shadows in my makeup bag. I&#x27;ve never tried Sleek before, but I am extremely impressed with the quality of the makeup and the packaging for such a reasonable price. The shadows compare to some higher end ones I own, and while the packaging is basic, it looks sturdy and seems like it would hold up with frequent use.</li>
    <li> love it! make up lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t ware off&lt;br /&gt;got my palette sooner than the arrival day&lt;br /&gt;worth the wait and can&#x27;t complain about the cost!</li>
    <li> I wish they sold sleek products here in the US. This is honestly worth the money. I&#x27;m in love with sleek. It&#x27;s almost as good as Urban Decay.</li>
    <li> I love the sleek eye-shadow formula. They are easy to build-up and blend well.</li>
    <li> I love this palette so much! Fantastic neutral colors that allow you to create a light/bright look or darker/smoky look. It takes a few weeks to receive since it&#x27;s a UK brand and ships from there. The powder is wonderfully pigmented and lasts all day without transferring or shifting (I do use a primer, though). They are an animal-cruelty-free makeup brand (based on what I&#x27;ve researched online), which is why I tried them out in the first place!</li>
    <li> This natural palette mineral based eye shadow palette is fantastic. I hardly have to place the brush on the palette to get so much eye shadow on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors in this palette range from white to black (but they label the colors as nougat, nubuck, cappuccino, honeycomb, toast, taupe conker, moss, bark, mineral earth, regal, and noir)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did not like is the size. Its very small and I thought the diameter of the shadows would like 1.5 to 2 inches but its barely an inch. So keep that in mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall I&#x27;m glad with the product, for my purposes I won&#x27;t be buying it again but its still a great palette with a variety of natural colors and application is very easy. (Plus it comes with a beautiful built-in mirror)</li>
    <li> I love sleek pallets ! My only problem is when i got it the mirror on the right side wasn&#x27;t connected at all, didn&#x27;t have a stub to hook or click it back in :( kinda disappointed. The only problem with these is that the mirrors are so flimsy. I had the storm pallet and the mirror broke off as well and then it&#x27;s hard to maintain a clean pallet. I guess you can depot them... but still. It shouldn&#x27;t have came with a half connected mirror! Other than that these colors are so pigmented for the price. Wish we had them in stores in the US!</li>
    <li> arrived earlier than expected, and color looks great! overall very pleased</li>
    <li> I love the colors in this palette and what makes it even better is the smooth application that you get from this product. It is so silky and applies with ease. The sponge brush/ applicator that comes with it is pretty nice as well, even though I normally use a different brush that I purchased elsewhere. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it and I would definitely order it again</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality for price.  I use it for shadow and liner.  The colors are perfect.</li>
    <li> So the first day I wore the eyeshadow in the palette to work my co-worker who knows I collect eyeshadow asked if I was wearing another expensive eyeshadow brand... their palettes are more than 4 times the price of this one!! this eyeshadow is easy to work with, great colors, and stays a long time. I have spent a lot more money on worse eyeshadows. This will be money well spent if you like palettes. Another great thing about these palettes is they all have a mix of matte and more shimmery shades, so you can create a lot of looks!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal palate!  There&#x27;s a lot of nude palettes out there &amp; this one is worthy of comparing to the best of them.  I&#x27;ve been reAching for this every day because the colors are all so wearable, high quality &amp; last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic value for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a huge makeup collection &amp; wants some greAt basics - as well as for a makeup junkie! Shipping from the UK didn&#x27;t take nearly as long as I expected &amp; everything arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Sleek.  This is department store quality for sure.  The packaging is solid, the shadows are well made -this is really a small price for what you are getting.</li>
    <li> So snappy,happy that I snapped this up instead of spending big bucks else where. I love the colors. They are great for everyday use!</li>
    <li> the top row had very poor pigmentation,  top row only one good color. bottom row is beautiful. oh and i struggle to open it, its like its glued shut.</li>
    <li> Lovely product, but sadly the case lid broke off within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Nice colors. They stay put.</li>
    <li> As in all my previous Sleek reviews you cannot go wrong with their products. Great pigmentation and long wear.</li>
    <li> This is one of my go-to palettes for everyday natural makeup. Like all Sleek eyeshadows, they&#x27;re super pigmented and apply very smoothly, especially considering its cheaper price. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again once I run out.</li>
    <li> Love this pallate.  will buy again from this company!</li>
    <li> I did receive my pallet earlier than I expected, but it came in with an eyeshadow broken. I was really disappointed. Also the inside has scratches on it. The sad part is that I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet.</li>
    <li> the product arrive broken at my door....deception!</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful and the little applicator it comes with works pretty well unlike others. They shipped it less than 24hrs from when I placed my order and I recieved it in less than 2 weeks which is awesome considering it came from the UK and I live on the west coast.</li>
    <li> The original palette appears to be matte, however when I got it- the only matte shadow was the black! Every other shadow was a weird two-toned shimmer shade, and a couple of them weren&#x27;t even close to the image shown. I purchased it from RH cosmetics, fulfilled by Amazon, however I think this is just an issue with the palette itself. In short, if you want matte- don&#x27;t get the original one.</li>
    <li> I liked the natural colors of this pallete . It &#x27;s strong and Matt as I expected. Would buy more from these palettes.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great seller, totally recommended</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and was excited to see this palette in person after seeing swatches online. The price is nice, but only a few of the shadows are pigmented enough to even use (noir, shimmer colors, and moss).  The top half of the palette apart from the last shimmery color will not show up on my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an aspiring MUA. I ordered this palette wanting a good deal without compromising quality and I definitely got that. The shadows in this palette are so pigmented and easy to blend. I love how it&#x27;s versatile for day looks and dramatic looks as well. The palette itself is much smaller than I thought, the size I would similarly compare to is the iPhone 5. But that&#x27;s a plus as well because I can just stick in my purse for any touch ups. It also arrived a couple weeks before it&#x27;s delivery date. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. :)</li>
    <li> When I bought this I didn&#x27;t expect it to come in a two pack; which was a happy surprise. The pallete works really well and is one of my longest lasting colors.</li>
    <li> What a great selection of shimmer &amp; matte!  They are gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Best quality eyeshadow for an affordable price.FORGET ABOUT MAC or SEPHORA PRODUCTS. This one right here beats them all. The colors are so rich and pigmented. Blends easily. Comes in a elegant cute black case. Seriously took a week for them to arrived. Now on a mission to collect all eyeshadow palettes from this brand :)</li>
    <li> These are fantastic eyeshadows...great pigmentation, and stays on for hours. Even the lightest colors are quite vivid. My all-time favorite Sleek palette. A+!</li>
    <li> For the price- the pigmentation and quality is through the roof. Great mixture of matte and shimmer shadows. I keep it in my pro makeup kit.</li>
    <li> LOVE this palette -- great mattes and two or three shimmer colors (but very subtle). This is a great one for everyday and for evening looks.</li>
    <li> I just received today in the mail; I thought it was supposed to be coming in July but it got here super quick. I used the palette today while getting ready and just like all the other viewers said, it is super pigmented. The black isn&#x27;t as pigmented as I would have hoped but I still like it. It is as the name implied, sleek. Great size for travel. This will be the first of many sleek eye shadow palettes I would be getting. It is comparable to MAC however the size of the shadow is smaller than MAC.</li>
    <li> I do not care for this palette. I thought I was getting all mat colors, but there are shinny colors as well. It does not stay on well at all. I tried  to use it several times,  but could never get the colors to blend well or stay on.</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing, and very pigmented. My eyeshadow stays on pretty much all day! Love it, and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice colors , just a little small . If you like a color then it will be gone before you know it !  I bought it in a whim and I liked it !</li>
    <li> Not all eyeshadow have a quality pigment.</li>
    <li> I have seen these palettes mentioned on many makeup and fashion blogs and was pleasantly surprised to see that the product lived up to the hype. The colors are soft, wearable, blendable, and are easy to apply. The packaging is of decent quality and I would buy other palettes from this brand with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Au Natural palette and Vintage Romance palette from Lucky Girl. The estimated delivery date was around 3-4 weeks (from UK to Kentucky, USA), and I received it in a little over a week! I was amazed at the fast shipping! None of the eyeshadows were broken, either. As for the quality of the shadows, I am amazed. Some of them don&#x27;t swatch extremely well, but I&#x27;ve been extremely satisfied with all of the shadows I have tried. I will definitely order more when I want more eyeshadows. I&#x27;d also like to try other products from Sleek.</li>
    <li> I just want to give an honest review, to the make up junkies out there like me who are still first time buyers of the infamous Sleek eyeshadow palettes. I&#x27;ve got quite a collection of eyeshadow palettes, maybe 40, from pricier brands like Smashbox, Nars and UD, to inexpensive drugstore brands like Wet n Wild, ELF and NYC. I am no stranger to the those bargain palettes of 28, 88, 120, and 252 color ranges, and I have made a few palettes on my own. Looooove eyeshadow, what can I say. So I&#x27;m not calling myself some \\&quot;eyeshadow palette expert\\&quot; by any means, just that as I continue, please understand where I am coming from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadow palettes have a strange addictive quality about them, I can obviously attest to that. Even as I sit here, I am thinking about the next Sleek palette I am going to purchase. But, you ask, if I am going to get another one, why give this palette only four stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Sleek palette as I come to join the party, and I guess I was expecting something... grander. First thing to be said is that these palettes are small - much smaller than you might perceive on your computer screen. I was expecting a smooth black case containing 12 Mac-size 26mm pans of rich color, but this is not quite the case (no pun intended). These pans are 20mm, and are not filled to the brimm. The whole thing can fit in the palm of your hand, generally speaking, which makes this a great \\&quot;travel multi\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let&#x27;s talk about what drives people mad in the first place - the pigmentation. These palettes are heralded as superior in color payoff, but gosh golly, I really can&#x27;t agree. I opened it up, marveled at the color arrangement (which is just beautiful) and commenced swatching. Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom set of colors are not bad, with \\&quot;Noir\\&quot; (the black shadow, of course) being the easiest to swatch. Most show up fine without primer, but I expected this to be a \\&quot;primer optional\\&quot; kinda thing. To really get at the depth of color here, you WILL need a primer. Especially for the lighter colors, particularly Nougat (the ivory color, far left) and Nubuck (the gray adjacent). But they all apply smoothly and blend well, and feel silky to the touch. And that&#x27;s really what I can say about the colors. Despite their less-than-stellar pigmentation, these babies are super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging lives up to it&#x27;s namesake, black and sophisticated, with a large mirror and thin shadow applicator. Included is a protective clear plasic sheet with the order of the shadow names, this is not meant to be thrown away. What I believe to be the greatest appeal of these palettes is the color organization and the fact that the company has so many editions. Also, the price is great, considering what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes,I will order another one, simply because these are affordable, colorful and travel friendly. They would also make great gifts. While not quite the color payoff of a MUFE eyeshadow, for the equivalent of a drugstore product, this is pretty good. The Au Natural palette is definitely the univeral must-have of the entire collection, the LE Vintage Romance palette looks beautifully flattering to all as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happily, I recieved my palette within 11 days of purchase, and I live on the east coast. I have ordered some blushes, which also get rave reviews, so I am eager to test those out. But I do hope you enjoy!</li>
    <li> lots of fall out but good color</li>
    <li> Highly pigmented.  A little goes a looooong looooong way.  I had to get used to dipping my makeup brush ever so slightly into pot.  Great for me for the long run though as product will last FOREVER, literally!  Other than that, blends beautifully and very silky to touch.  Oh and best part is, I&#x27;m a waitress at a very popular bar here in Hawaii and it LASTED THE WHOLE SHIFT WITHOUT CAKING!  First time an eyeshadow has produced that effect for me, no joke!  Love the beautiful color pallets.  So far I have purchased the Au Natural Pallet, the Storm Pallet, the Blush by 3 in Lace, and the Face Form Contour and I love them ALL.  Currently working on purchasing the Oh so special and maybe the Arabian Nights or Bad Girl.  Aww who am I kidding.  I&#x27;m probably going to purchase them all.  If you want bang for your buck, you need to try Sleek.  I truly love ALL their products.  I can absolutely guarantee you will not be disappointed!  Oh and almost forgot, a lot of these colors are dupes for Mac and Naked eye shadows except Sleek is, dare I say it???, better pigmented and longer lasting....lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sleek customer for life! Love this palette! It goes on so easy and it doesn&#x27;t crease!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase. Very nice to apply on the eye lid, No need to use a lot of it, color is perfect. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> the pallet itself would have been awesome but when it came 2 of the colors were shattered&lt;br /&gt;it was more than the price of the pallet to ship it back so totally not worth it&lt;br /&gt;I ended up taping the shattered colors up and using the rest of it&lt;br /&gt;would have been awesome if it came in tact</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this Palette</li>
    <li> This is a great palette for price, love the colors and pigment, will definitely be buying more for gifts. 💜</li>
    <li> I love these shadows!  The staying power with or without a primer is amazing to me.  I own all the UD shadows and they don&#x27;t even hold this long (Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I LOVE UD!) I&#x27;m really excited I purchased these :)</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!! i have 4 of this palettes from the same seller and i love all of them!!&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice pallet.  The colors are not as pigmented as some higher end products, but they blend beautifully and make a great eye with stacking and blending.  Excellent for a light daytime look.</li>
    <li> This product is good, pigment is okay not the best. Some colors are better but the lighter ones are not as good. Overall this palette is good for starting out or beginners.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow pallet is the best!  I love it.  It is very good quality, and the colors compliment most skin tones. It shipped quickly and the price was wonderful!  This palette is a must have in any beauty bag. I am so happy with this purchase.  Love it!</li>
    <li> A less expensive, better edited version of The Naked palette. These are good quality shadows</li>
    <li> Like the title says, the pigmentation is what impressed me most about this palette. I will state that the palette is a bit smaller in person than it appears online. Actually ALL of the sleek products look MUCH bigger online. However the space is used wisely and you still get quite a bit of product. I was also very very impressed with the seller.  I live in the United States and my package arrived within 5 days from the UK. I was amazed. Everything was also packaged VERY well and professionally.</li>
    <li> Nice pigmented eye shadows.  The light colors can be a bit chalky but the darker shades go on nicely and are easy to blend and smudge.  Love the sleek looking case with a large mirror.  Great price for what you get.  Also good for travel.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t as good as the blush and contour palettes I&#x27;ve bought in the past. They are still fairly decent, medium pigmentation, but the fact that they contain parabens and paraffins are a big problem. These eyeshadows have the potential to be really great, but for the price they are an ok deal if only they would lose the unsafe ingredients</li>
    <li> I ordered 19items but I just got 6items and another was missing.&lt;br /&gt;I waste my time and money with this order.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the case was broken and some colors were crumbled!!! I&#x27;m so upset. Guess next time I decide to buy makeup online I&#x27;ll think again :(</li>
    <li> i love this palette! 1st off the colors look exactly like they do on the screen, so no surprises. also, the colors are mostly matte, with a few shimmery frosts but they are beautiful. color combinations are endless..if u need a new eyeshadow palette, this is the one i&#x27;d buy as they are neutral colors &amp; will go with almost anything, from creating natural looks to something more dramatic. i&#x27;m ao glad i bought this.</li>
    <li> I love love love these eye shadows.  I have every palette and mix and match so my eyes look different everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great pigment.  Non creasing. Stays on my eyes for 20 hours straight when I work.  No touch up needed and have not had a crease yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and quality of this product I love it.  The best I have found on Amazon yet.  I recommend these shadows for anyone who likes matts and dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I constantly get compliments on my eyes from these shadows. Perfect shadow.  I have nothing negative to say.  I love the matts more and use them more than the shimmers but most pallets have several matts in them.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing product. I love this pallets its for natural and smoky looks, i use this pallet every day for my to complemet my more color look.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this palette. The colors look pretty in the pan, but they&#x27;re not pigmented at all. They apply patchy and do not blend well. Plus, a couple of the shimmery shades have glitter in them. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> beautifully pigmented and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Meh.  Boring colors, NO payout, doesn&#x27;t last, bleh.</li>
    <li> Very well pigmented, great price for a great product. It&#x27;s got all the essential colors!</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;ll start with packaging, wrapped in bubble wrap, nothing was broken. BUT the shadows are a lot smaller then I anticipated.  They&#x27;re even smaller then MAC and makeup geek shadows.  Nothing was broken which was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was most excited for the V2 palette because of the color &amp;#34;fern&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a matte foresty green color and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Now it&#x27;s beautiful but I literally had to pack on like 7 layers of it to even show up.  Also I used a base AND a primer and the shadow rubbed off within about an hour and a half.  Not sure how the other colors are going to work but I swatched all of them and most of them seem smooth but almost chalky. So we&#x27;ll see. Pretty disappointed with the staying power so far.</li>
    <li> The color pay off on these are SO good! I use this for my clients (make up clients, brides etc) and on myself and I love it. so affordable and just great.  There is a bit of fallout, but not bad, and its super blend able you don&#x27;t need hardly any product either because the color pay off is so good.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and in great condition! Colors look a little different on the computer, but that&#x27;s because every monitor is different. All is well!</li>
    <li> For how much it is, I&#x27;d give it a 5. I heard good things about sleek eyeshadows. And they do live up to the expectations. They are pigmented, easy to blend. I wouldn&#x27;t say it stay on my eye for a long time. But I prefer it than wet n wild palette because sleek eyeshadows last longer than wet n wild on my eyelid( I have oily eyelid). I really wish they come out with more neutral palette. I&#x27;d love to try more.</li>
    <li> I liked this Palette a lot. As someone who regularly use neutral shade palettes, this is by far my favorite. This had good colors, very sleek packaging, looked good on, stays on a while ( with primer first mind you) and is over all awesome. I would give it 5 stars, but the case while pretty, is very hard to open every single time I try to open it. Aside from this, it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
    <li> Just got my eyeshadows on the mail, its a beautiful elegant set, the fairest one came broken... but I was expecting that, I&#x27;m very glad it was just one, I collected the broken eyeshadow and moistened the powder with alcohol and press it into the tin, managed to save more than half, for the price you get an excellent quality set, comes with a mirror, and a sponge applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, the only but is that you have to be able to wait loooong time for it to come in the mail.</li>
    <li> Absolutley love this palette its perfect to wear every day or night.  The pigment is incredible this is my 4th of this brand and im in love with all of them</li>
    <li> iam absolutely will not order from you again because the eyeshadow that I received from you was scattered &amp; was supposed to give it as a gift to my friend what I will do now ??!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! The colors are gorgeous- the picture doesn&#x27;t do justice. The shadows blend effortlessly and they stay all day. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. If you&#x27;re contemplating buying this, just do it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure about this product, but let me tell you how happy I am when I used it.  Colors are very pigmented and stays on all day without any crease.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice colors and it won&#x27;t crease</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price point - very comparable to higher end eyeshadows!  I use this as frequently as my Naked and Lorac palettes!</li>
    <li> Wore some of the shadow to work today and I didn&#x27;t rub or itch my eyes at all.  I am so glad I got this.  great investment !</li>
    <li> This the best colors..</li>
    <li> The pictures do not do it justice. Very good everyday daytime colors, the pigmentation of the mattes are not as good put on a primer and you should be ok, worth every penny however. The colors are beautiful and you can create a lot of looks, the packaging is cute and sleek  and easy for travel. BUY IT YOU WONT REGRET!</li>
    <li> The color are super cute and very pigmented and creamy!!</li>
    <li> A great inexpensive palette.</li>
    <li> I was excited to be able to buy matte but very pigmented palette. I used an urban decay primer and it did NOT spread through my eye lid. I also tried a MAC primer with the same result. Finally, I tried without a eye primer. It worked great but, about 2 hours later, I went to the bathroom and the eyeshadow creased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Nougat came in broken other than that it&#x27;s fine</li>
</ol>
