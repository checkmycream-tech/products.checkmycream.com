<li> So cute but a bit small.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s big and soft.  </li>
<li> This time I sewed the sides that frayed last time, I also took pictures demonstrating how well this can hold up to everyday high school</li>
<li> And much bigger than expected!</li>
<li> I was concerned that this would be too small for all of my makeup when I ordered it, but I was really surprised when I got it!</li>
<li> The only real differences is that the inside was frayed, the outside was a little dirty and not as soft as it started out, and it lost it&#x27;s blushies.</li>
<li> But it easily gets dirty thought.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s actually not that little!</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s small enough that I can take it with me when I travel!</li>
<li> It has a lot of room, in the inside of the pouch has little poky dots, and it has a little pompom on the zipper!</li>
<li> but it will be stiff</li>
<li> It fits all my pens, my highlighter, eraser, a few pencils, my lipstick, and even my calculator!</li>
<li> This makeup bag is small, it can&#x27;t hold a brush inside, that&#x27;s how small</li>
<li> I mean it probably can</li>
<li> And it is also very very fluffy!</li>
<li> It barely gets dirty and it has lots of room!</li>
<li> Bad quality.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s is very cute; looks exactly like the picture, super soft and has plenty of room inside. I use it for school and I can fit 5 mechanical pencils, 6-inch ruler, highlighter, sharpie, large pen, calculator, earbuds, mp3, children&#x27;s scissors, and a mini stapler into it! And there&#x27;s still room! If you&#x27;re on the edge of whether to get it or not I would say go for it!&lt;br /&gt;2nd Order:&lt;br /&gt;After using the first one for six months at school I decided to order another one because the inside of the first one was fraying. This time I sewed the sides that frayed last time, I also took pictures demonstrating how well this can hold up to everyday high school (the first three are the new one I ordered and the last three are the old one). The only real differences is that the inside was frayed, the outside was a little dirty and not as soft as it started out, and it lost it&#x27;s blushies. I&#x27;m kind of upset the inside frayed but I still give this five stars because it didn&#x27;t affect the functionality and it still looks cute. I would defiantly suggest this to anyone looking for a cute pencil case or whatever else you may use it for!</li>
    <li> 1. Bigger than it looks&lt;br /&gt;2. Shipping didnt take a month&lt;br /&gt;3. Very cute and soft&lt;br /&gt;4.worth the money</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this, I planned on using it for a cute little makeup bag. The outside was cute. I loved it. Until I opened it up and saw the GIANT HOLE IN IT. Totally unacceptable. Bad quality. I do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Very cute and alot of room</li>
