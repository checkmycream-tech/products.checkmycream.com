      <li>It was okay,</li>

      <li>It left my hair clean and moist.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for five years and this is the first conditioner that worked for my hair.</li>
      <li>Before I began using this product I had soft shiny hair with no split ends</li>
      <li>Stripped my hair completely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really starting to grow back fast, and healthier, and I believe it&#x27;s the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Really, just not worth the cost.</li>

<li> I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
<li> My hair hasn&#x27;t been this hydrated in a long time.</li>
<li> Going to dry again...</li>
<li> my hair came out very DRY ...</li>
<li> and now my hair is starting to look dull and dry, and then ends are starting to split.</li>
<li> It looked shiny but had absolutely no slip.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> The bottles are smaller, but I use very little on my medium-length hair.</li>
<li> Hair didn&#x27;t tangle like other conditioners do when massaging your scalp.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in it than other conditions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
<li> I did buy this for the benefits of the black seed oil</li>
<li> just didn&#x27;t want to use half the bottle</li>
<li> had a hard time getting the comb thru it.  </li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> The smell isn&#x27;t to bad either.</li>
<li> The smell is atrocious.</li>
<li> Hate it.</li>

    <li> I use the nouirshing oil from this same company and have been very happy with it. I purchased the shampoo and it worked well on my hair. The conditioner I add to my sulfate shampoos and it reduces the stripping effect they can have on my hair. It smells just like oil.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this conditioner, and the fact that it has no toxic ingredients (parabens, pthalates, sulfates, etc.), but I do not feel that it really conditions very well.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for five years and this is the first conditioner that worked for my hair. I wish it came in a larger size!  My  coils were soft and easy to detangle. Buying again,</li>
