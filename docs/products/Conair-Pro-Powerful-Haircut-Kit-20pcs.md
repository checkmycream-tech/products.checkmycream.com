      <li>We have used these clippers four times now and have had no problems, we never had to use the turbo mode and the attachments are great.</li>

      <li>Inexpensive for reasonably good durability - there are sub-10$ kits with</li>
      <li>Just do your best to clean it and just use a dab of the lube it comes with after each cut on the blades to keep them in shape.</li>

      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>It will be better if the knife can be seperated to cleaning.</li>
      <li>it is excellant and perfect for french cut along with shaping beard.</li>
      <li>Easy to do the front and head-sides</li>
      <li>I have moderately-dense, 1.5 inch hair that I trim down to 0.5 inches and this Conair is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>Also, an important note on the \\&quot;power button\\&quot; feature:</li>
      <li>Free Trimmer that comes along with</li>

      <li>And most importantly the clippers are reasonably quite, just a soft hum.    </li>
      <li>With haircuts being 10-15 bucks, if this thing even lasted me 2 haircuts, I&#x27;d basically be square, right?</li>
      <li>Item was out of stock when i first wanted it,  but it was well worth  </li>
      <li>Easy, because the owner manual instructions were clear.</li>
      <li>first chance you get.</li>
      <li>that just means it will be more likely to pull your hairs.</li>
      <li>I had to replace my favorite clippers when the power cord finally gave out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Secondly, for a 20 dollar clipper, this was a much more user-friendly purchase than the andis.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are pretty cheap, and I&#x27;ve done about a dozen haircuts with them, but I am looking for a different brand this time.  </li>
      <li>wasn&#x60;t much.</li>
      <li>and it vibrates my whole hand.</li>
      <li>It seems very well made.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t feel like sinking another hundred into a new one, so I poked around this site looking for some cheaper alternatives.    </li>
      <li>chose this unit because my previous Conair clippers had held up to many years of use.  </li>
      <li>The last time, the clipper came apart, and I have not been able to put it back together.  </li>
      <li>First off, I have VERY thick hair, and it took quite a few passes (granted, with the 7/8ths comb) before I got perfect</li>
      <li>I used to have an almost $100 Andis professional clipper, but after almost a year of use either the motor or some other electric component in it degraded to the point where I can not use it any more.</li>
      <li>I have short curly afro-caribbean hair , and use the trimmer to trim myself (with 2 mirrors), and maintain a low, even, easy to brush cut (so i dont really use the styling clips) ..    </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect professional cuts if you are the not-so-patient type or have real dense hair.  </li>
      <li>Turned my normal 30 minute haircut into about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>The turbo mode is more powerful, but I have found better cutting with slow, steady strokes in the normal</li>
      <li>Well, as I said, I&#x27;ve gotten 2 haircuts with this clipper so far</li>
      <li>I keep it short, so the most I need is usually a &#x27;touch-up&#x27; trim.  </li>
      <li>This is the second haircut set i&#x27;ve owned, and so far its paid for itself in saved trips to the barber ..  </li>
      <li>You have to hold the button down the whole time you cut your hair.</li>
      <li>so i inquired her on my next visit and been told they use same brand and are quite heavy duty and highly recommened.so if you want professional looking hair cut, its the brand to pick.</li>
      <li>Easy cleaning of the blades - secret: use a vacuum cleaner on the sides - that unused attachment you have been saving just for this purpose!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

<li> i used reminghton,wahl and many other random brands to get a army hair cut.</li>
<li> They didn&#x27;t last long but my other clippers made it just in time.</li>
<li> All trimmer need is a single AA</li>
<li> I tried to cut the sides of my head down to a #1, the hair started at about 3/4 inch long.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re also plenty sharp.</li>
<li> battery.&lt;br /&gt;There are other conair brands</li>
<li> This unit is not powerful at all.  </li>
<li> #2, then finally #1 and take it really slow.  </li>
<li> The trimmer is metal and very sturdy, and the attachments are plastic and also very tough.</li>
<li> It bogged down while trying to cut my hair.  </li>
<li> The scissors were a little tricky to use on myself, but with some work I figured them out.</li>
<li> The oil is too little.</li>
<li> This product is junk dont waste your money</li>
<li> I use it without any trouble.</li>
<li> I just spent almost a hundred bucks, but you don&#x27;t even bother to include the combs at least?</li>
<li> but I hate using it because it is super noisy</li>
<li> I was disappointed at my first attempt to use this unit.  </li>
<li> I used to go to a saloon every 2 months, now I need to go  just twice a year for the mandatory professional sculpting (once every 3 times of self cutting).</li>
<li> I have used this clipper very few times.  </li>
<li> If you are only planning on cutting your hair once a week or every other week, taking a little extra time isn&#x27;t so bad of a deal considering you pay a quarter to a fifth of the price.</li>
<li> That was something that had annoyed me about my previous purchase.</li>
<li> Just be slow and thorough.    </li>
<li> i mean alot...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s half of a very thin trashbag with straps attached...    </li>
<li> Cutting hair is not that hard.</li>
<li> You will need to take off the blades for cleaning about every 3 times of cutting.  </li>
<li> it was very difficult to snap it in place.  </li>
<li> awful!</li>

    <li> It meets my requirement. It will be better if the knife can be seperated to cleaning. The oil is too little.</li>
    <li> It is a great hair cutter for this price. Do not expect miracles, but it defnitely will cut your hair, Comes with many useful accessories like  scissors, comb etc.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Inexpensive for reasonably good durability - there are sub-10$ kits with toy-like combs!&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy cleaning of the blades - secret: use a vacuum cleaner on the sides - that unused attachment you have been saving just for this purpose!&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to do the front and head-sides yourself!&lt;br /&gt;4. The turbo mode is more powerful, but I have found better cutting with slow, steady strokes in the normal ON mode.&lt;br /&gt;5. Savings - NOT thousands or hundreds of dollars for me. I used to go to a saloon every 2 months, now I need to go  just twice a year for the mandatory professional sculpting (once every 3 times of self cutting). Around [...] bucks in savings per year for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wired - but were you expecting a rechargeable cordless at this price?&lt;br /&gt;2. Not advisable to try doing the back of the head yourself. You will need someone for 5 minutes to do the back and for getting a uniform neckline.  If you want a pure-self-cut-kit and short hair, get the Remington Short Cut Rechargeable Clipper - self cuts everywhere beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t expect professional cuts if you are the not-so-patient type or have real dense hair.  I have moderately-dense, 1.5 inch hair that I trim down to 0.5 inches and this Conair is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;4. You will need to take off the blades for cleaning about every 3 times of cutting.  It is simple to oil, realign and put back the blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this item so that I could start saving money and time by giving myself haircuts at home. I was impressed with how many things the kit came with. It&#x27;s a great value for the price. The trimmer is metal and very sturdy, and the attachments are plastic and also very tough. The scissors were a little tricky to use on myself, but with some work I figured them out. They&#x27;re also plenty sharp. haha&lt;br /&gt;Overall the kit is a great deal. The plastic storage case is also very useful for keeping things under the sink while not in use.</li>
    <li> I have used this clipper very few times.  Every time I needed to change an attachment comb it was very difficult to snap it in place.  A couple of times it would just not work.  The last time, the clipper came apart, and I have not been able to put it back together.  I guess you get what you pay for . . . awful!</li>
    <li> We have used these clippers four times now and have had no problems, we never had to use the turbo mode and the attachments are great. And most importantly the clippers are reasonably quite, just a soft hum.    A great value!</li>
    <li> I used to have an almost $100 Andis professional clipper, but after almost a year of use either the motor or some other electric component in it degraded to the point where I can not use it any more. I really didn&#x27;t feel like sinking another hundred into a new one, so I poked around this site looking for some cheaper alternatives.    My girlfriends brother mentioned he uses \\&quot;some 20 dollar conair\\&quot; and it has served him well for some time. So I looked specifically for a conair clipper and found this, just over 20 bucks. With haircuts being 10-15 bucks, if this thing even lasted me 2 haircuts, I&#x27;d basically be square, right? So I bought it, and now 2 haircuts later, I am writing my review.    First off, I have VERY thick hair, and it took quite a few passes (granted, with the 7/8ths comb) before I got perfect even-ness. The Andis was a monster and silently and swiftly sliced through my hair. Compared to a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; clipper, this is a bit anemic. However, how often to you even need to cut your hair? If you are only planning on cutting your hair once a week or every other week, taking a little extra time isn&#x27;t so bad of a deal considering you pay a quarter to a fifth of the price. Also, an important note on the \\&quot;power button\\&quot; feature: DON&#x27;T USE IT, it WILL increase the power, but in my experience that just means it will be more likely to pull your hairs. Just be slow and thorough.    Secondly, for a 20 dollar clipper, this was a much more user-friendly purchase than the andis. This comes with a carrying case, which the Andis did not. This comes with the combs, which the Andis did not. It comes with scissors, a comb, etc. etc. that the Andis did not. That was something that had annoyed me about my previous purchase. I just spent almost a hundred bucks, but you don&#x27;t even bother to include the combs at least? Or a carrying case for that matter? Sheesh... Oh, but that being said, if you do buy this just throw the smock away first chance you get. It&#x27;s half of a very thin trashbag with straps attached...    Well, as I said, I&#x27;ve gotten 2 haircuts with this clipper so far and it shows no sign of letting out yet. Just do your best to clean it and just use a dab of the lube it comes with after each cut on the blades to keep them in shape. Every haircut with this from now on is a savings for me, which was the point. As I said in the review title, this kit is perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to groom my long-haired chihuahua.  Great deal!  I use it without any trouble.</li>
    <li> These clippers work well when you push the turbo button, but I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s there.  Why don&#x27;t they just run in &#x27;turbo&#x27; all the time.  It&#x27;s kind of awkward when cutting your own hair to push this button and get all the sides of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are pretty cheap, and I&#x27;ve done about a dozen haircuts with them, but I am looking for a different brand this time.  The button just doesn&#x27;t make sense.  You have to hold the button down the whole time you cut your hair.</li>
    <li> Does a good job but tends to clog easy. Have to take it apart to clean too often.</li>
    <li> Turned my normal 30 minute haircut into about 10 minutes. should have bought this years ago. Would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought these so I would have clippers to use while my Oster clippers were being delivered to me. They didn&#x27;t last long but my other clippers made it just in time.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for about 10 years.  I keep it short, so the most I need is usually a &#x27;touch-up&#x27; trim.  I had to replace my favorite clippers when the power cord finally gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this unit because my previous Conair clippers had held up to many years of use.  I was disappointed at my first attempt to use this unit.  This unit is not powerful at all.  It bogged down while trying to cut my hair.  I don&#x27;t have thick/long hair.  I tried to cut the sides of my head down to a #1, the hair started at about 3/4 inch long.  I had to use #3, then #2, then finally #1 and take it really slow.  I won&#x27;t use this product again and will be looking for something else.</li>
    <li> This product is junk dont waste your money I ended up throwing it away    Do yourself a favor Spend about $60 on a good pair of Andis or similiar</li>
    <li> speedy shiptment, excellent quality and craftsmanship, they work great. for the price i&#x27;d deffi buy these again without a doubt.. Lots of goodies for the price, and i mean alot...</li>
    <li> This is the second haircut set i&#x27;ve owned, and so far its paid for itself in saved trips to the barber ..  I have short curly afro-caribbean hair , and use the trimmer to trim myself (with 2 mirrors), and maintain a low, even, easy to brush cut (so i dont really use the styling clips) ..    Item was out of stock when i first wanted it,  but it was well worth  the wait. Great delivery and everything</li>
    <li> this has been used for about 10 years now.  it has been droped, banged, etc and it still keeps on going..love it.</li>
    <li> i used reminghton,wahl and many other random brands to get a army hair cut.They had fancy design but output wasn&#x60;t much.I always saw this trimmer at my barber place but never knew its name or brand.once i start using it i felt its the same trimmer used by barber so i inquired her on my next visit and been told they use same brand and are quite heavy duty and highly recommened.so if you want professional looking hair cut, its the brand to pick.Free Trimmer that comes along with it is excellant and perfect for french cut along with shaping beard.All trimmer need is a single AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;There are other conair brands too .They differ in size,color,packing .All are basically same with different pieces to get different hair lenght of hair cut.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and it has worked alright for a couple years but I hate using it because it is super noisy and it vibrates my whole hand. The turbo button is stupid because I have to press it the whole time to get a decent cut making it more than awkward when cutting my own hair plus it gets really hot by the end.</li>
    <li> I have the very similar Conair HC275R. It&#x27;s worked perfectly for 8 years. Then it needed some adjustment. Easy, because the owner manual instructions were clear. It seems very well made. Cutting hair is not that hard. I&#x27;ve saved over $ 2,000 on haircuts.</li>
