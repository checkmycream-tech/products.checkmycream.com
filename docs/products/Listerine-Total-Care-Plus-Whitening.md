      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT TOO!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for better results!</li>
      <li>This is our favorite mouth wash!</li>
      <li>It does a great job of cleaning and isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this great product for some time now, so when I saw it was available on subscribe and save, I immediately ordered.</li>
      <li>i usaly use the cheap cvs or target brand and they work great</li>
      <li>My mouth feels so amazing afterwards though.</li>
      <li>but this stuff is amazing if your goal is to whiten your teeth.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it has to taste like this or be so foamy to work effectively.</li>
      <li>Best all-around rinse out there.</li>
      <li>Nice mouthwash, but the &amp;#34;Total Care&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Use at own risk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve always used Listerine and like the strength of it, then this is a nice change as it&#x27;s not so medicinal.  </li>
      <li>no matter what kind you choose,</li>
      <li>and I went with this seeing how many good stuff</li>
      <li>That, however, is one of the reasons it is so effective.</li>
      <li>There are so many good mouthwashes out there, this is not one of them.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d say just as good as the Crest whitestrips or better (having tried those a couple years ago).  </li>
      <li>can honestly say that my mouth tastes and feels cleaner and my breath stays fresher a lot</li>
      <li>It very strong.</li>
      <li>have very good dental hygiene, and am %100 certain it was caused from this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not the best tasting mouthwash but it leaves my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>This is very Good Listerine, It really does feel like it kills alot of germs, and after a couple of weeks my teeth has gotten whiter.</li>
      <li>My favorite and nicely priced</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of mouthwashes and some are more effective than others.</li>
      <li>But I liked the refreshing tingle from the mint flavor.</li>
      <li>So the longer you go after rinsing without do either the more effective it will</li>
      <li>Great price for a household staple delivered right to your doorstep .</li>
      <li>It is strong!</li>
      <li>Good clean feeling.</li>
      <li>all this being said, I&#x27;m really happy to have a product that combines fluoride (I have issues with cavities, no matter how good I try to be with oral hygiene) with whitening action.</li>
      <li>It may be strong, but it sure does the job!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product it has made a huge difference in the whiteness in my teeth</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m getting so grossed-out by it that I probably won&#x27;t be able to continue using it.</li>
      <li>Imagine Lightning striking inside your tooth every time you rinsed your mouth.</li>
      <li>and he rinsed ok,</li>
      <li>Chances are all consumer whitening products use this ingredient to safely bleach your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this Listerine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I usually use Act for the restorative stuff.  I thought I was buying something similar but apparently I was getting more than I bargained for.  This thing doesn&#x27;t only have the Act properties but also some kind of crazy concoction of whitening, anti-cavity, and other crap.  This creates an abomination of the likes I had ever seen.  First, it doesn&#x27;t stay liquidy and flush like normal Listerine, Act, and others do.  As you swish around this foul tasting liquid it begins to foam(cum) in your mouth.  When you spit it out you can&#x27;t just spit once, you have to keep spitting because it has foamed all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, every time I used this mouthwash I felt like my mouth was being raped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall (tldr) - I wanted a bottle of mouthwash, what I got was a bottle of cum</li>
    <li> Whaaaaaa, it tastes bad.  Ok, so does that mean it doesn&#x27;t work?  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the point.     Rinsing with chocolate milk syrup wouldn&#x27;t be advisable.  Just sayin&#x27;.    Sorry, I don&#x27;t rush to write a review for anything, but this kinda deserves a better.  After using it for 2 weeks, my son and I had whiter teeth, fresher breath and I notice a nice &#x27;slick&#x27; feeling every time I use it.     But, in the interest of fairness to people who complain about the strength of the product, I don&#x27;t use it as a straight mouth wash.  My son is autistic an oral health is a challenge, to say the least.  After a really depressing dental visit (the last of several) I decided to change things up.    Dental pics out.  Waterpick in.    Child Toothpaste out.  Colgate Complete in.    Sweet toothbrush w/charterers out.  Sonicare in.    At 11, my son had 4 cavities and needed a full mouth scaling.  Yay, mom of the year!  He drinks no soda and is not fond of sweets.      The most troubling aspect of our new regimen was that he couldn&#x27;t &#x27;rinse and spit&#x27; and ingesting fluoride is not a good idea.  On a whim I tried Purple Listerine and he rinsed ok, but I couldn&#x27;t tell if he was really rinsing.      The foaming bubbles show me he&#x27;s getting everything out he should and he actually enjoys the clean mouth.      Our last visit was an in and out with virtually no work needed.      Complain all you want, but I have to say this is among the best oral care products we have tried.</li>
    <li> Stop whining!! This is an amazing product it has made a huge difference in the whiteness in my teeth I could not be happier. Now I&#x27;m not saying this won&#x27;t burn but after a few uses you get use to it. Now I can leave it in for around 5 minutes the only reason I have to spit it out is if it foams up to much or I have things to do. I hope the other reviews do not scare if you can tolerate a little for a little while you will see a giant difference in whiteness. So I would say take the risk if its to much you loss ten bucks but most likely you will be able to handle it</li>
    <li> Mouth wash is usually not a problem for me. I decided to give this one a try even though the reviews were mixed and there were a lot of negative reviews. This product was fine for me at first. However, when I used it consecutively it started to burn my mouth. The burn or \\&quot;bruise\\&quot; would not go away for 2-3 days. This listerine does a good job cleaning germs and whitening teeth but it is not worth the burn or bruise that you suffer from it. I overall would NOT recommend this product because of the burning sensation. Other listerine products are fine. It is just that I am having problems with this one.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this product until I actually tried it. I&#x27;m not a wimp but this mouthwash BURNS! I thought \\&quot;what&#x27;s 30 seconds, that&#x27;s easy\\&quot;...but rinsing with this stuff will be the longest 30 seconds of your life. Your mouth will be on fire! The pros are you actually feel and see the peroxide working, which helps whiten but I don&#x27;t think that burn is worth it.</li>
    <li> Just because it tastes bad, it does not deserve 1 star.  I know it tastes really bad and it BURNS your mouth like no other,  but, after using it for 2 weeks, I definitely notice the difference.  My teeth looks whiter, I do not have bad morning breaths anymore and it stays that way throughout all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this does more bad to my gums than it does good to my teeth.  It does really burn, but it&#x27;s the *weird taste* that&#x27;s the deal breaker for me.  It&#x27;s not like the typical Listerine type taste at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t even know how to describe it ~ but I hate it.  I don&#x27;t want to waste the money ~ this stuff is not cheap ~ but I don&#x27;t think I can stand finishing the bottle.  I&#x27;ve used it for four days now.  Next time I&#x27;m at Walmart, I&#x27;ll be anxious to pick up my old usual mouthwashes ~ an Equate brand Listerine type and an Equate brand fluoride rinse.  With all the comments I&#x27;ve seen on here about how toxic fluoride is though, I guess I need to re-evaluate that choice.</li>
    <li> Reading some of the reviews, I can see why users would rate this product negatively. It is strong! (which is exactly why I use it) Matter of fact, it is so strong that on some days, it exfoliates the skin on the inside of my mouth. But, that is what I want. The alcohol and the hydrogen peroxide are a plus. To me, rinsing and flossing are just as important as brushing. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years and have not had a cavity during that time.</li>
    <li> I paid nearly 7.00 for this product. It came with Listerine toothpaste. This product burns and leaves such a nasty taste in your mouth that you have to brush your teeth afterwards. I decided to use this product as a household cleaner so my money won&#x27;t be wasted. The toothpaste taste horrible as well.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says as far as the whitening goes.   My breath has been smelling like pure a$$ on and off for almost a year because of my rotting wisdom teeth, and decided to buy this product.  I&#x27;ve been getting these white stringy things peeling off my gums, and I noticed my mouth is really sore.   I noticed similar side effects when I used the white bottle of listerine whitening months ago.  Also, when I first put this product in my mouth fire engines were going off.   It burns like a mofo.  Normally listerine dosnt burn me, but the smell did go away after the first use.  This isn&#x27;t for people with sensitive mouths.</li>
    <li> Good but seems to create saliva even after spitting out.  Not experienced that with any other Listerine mouthwash, not sure if it is because this is the whitening formula.</li>
    <li> I love this Listerine. It&#x27;s powerful, it&#x27;s effective, and it leaves my mouth tingling clean. I see the controversy but I&#x27;m not sure I understand it. I&#x27;ll keep buying!</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time last night and the entire time I was swishing it in my mouth, there was a horrendous burning sensation (so much that my eyes watered, which has never happened before when I used mouthwash).  I managed to do it for the recommended 60 seconds, and after I spit it out I noticed a lot of white gel-like strips in my mouth and a tiny portion of my gums actually turned white and puffy.  This morning my gums were very sensitive to brushing and bright red.  I thankfully had a dental cleaning the next day and so I asked my dentist if he had an idea what happened.  He said it actually happened to him as well and a few other patients.  He explained that some people are sensitive or allergic to one of the components in Total Care mouthwash and that the white gel-like strips are actually the outer layer of gum peeling off (which is why my gum turned white because it almost all stripped off).  Thankfully, it&#x27;ll heal pretty fast as long as I never use this again (no problem there!).   If any of this happens when you use this mouthwash, return it and don&#x27;t use it again!  Switch to a non-alcoholic mouthwash.  My dentist says that anything that has the name Total Care should be avoided (like Crest Total Care or Multicare).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about twelve weeks. My teeth feel nice and clean and appear whiter. Although dubbed \\&quot;fresh mint\\&quot; the flavor is noxious and not mintlike at all.  However, the benefits outweigh the sixty seconds of swishing around in my mouth.  My next scheduled dental appointment isn&#x27;t until May.  However, I have noticed that my gums and teeth seem healthier, ie, not bleeding, swollen or sore.  I had a burn on the roof of my mouth that was quite irritating.  I used this that night with some reservations but the next day, no burn, no pain. This is a product that takes some getting used to.  In addition to the off putting flavor, there is some weird bubbling, fizz action.  However, the benefits, a healthier mouth and white teeth, justify any sensory unpleasantness.</li>
    <li> This product is without a doubt the worst tasting mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  I am certain it does promote good gum and teeth health, as do the majority of similar products.  I also don&#x27;t think it produced any whitening effect over time.    I typically use Act Restorative mouthwashes and have tried others before, including Scope and Listerine, and store brands.  I&#x27;ve even used peroxide on occasion.  So I am not adverse to strong and/or poor flavor    While Listerine products sometimes have a medicinal taste, I can deal with that.  And I don&#x27;t mind the foaming of this mouthwash.  But this stuff is brutal.  Using the proper amount as indicated on the bottle, after maybe 5 or 10 seconds I find it tends to be so strong as to create a burning sensation in my mouth, on my tongue, etc.  It is not a personal reaction to the product either, as my wife and children have tried it as well as some guests and everyone has the same issue.    If they toned it down just a tad, it might be something more usable.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best mouthwash I have ever tasted.  It&#x27;s so sutle and pleasing to ny taste buds!  It&#x27;s so far superior to the original listerine (the green colored one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anybody who hasn&#x27;t tried it.  TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT TOO!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Great Price. Fast Delivery .Love the Listerine is my favorite mouth wash.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand anyone saying the taste is too harsh - yes it may be a little bit harsh but not to the point where you can&#x27;t take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love this product and will happily continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I like the flavor of this, but it does keep my breath fresh longer than Scope does. I have sensitive teeth, and this thing stings them. Yes, stings my teeth. I didn&#x27;t know it was possible either.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it burning my tongue, like other reviewers here seem to have had. I don&#x27;t think the hydrogen peroxide is what is causing it, since I have used hydrogen peroxide to wash in the past and have found it pleasantly mild.  Not bad, not good. I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great item...no issues or problems whatsoever...I will continue purchasing through this site if necessary or when I have gift cards.</li>
    <li> It is not the best tasting mouthwash but it leaves my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Recommend seller, not product.  Purchased on the recommendation of husband&#x27;s dental hygienist. We can&#x27;t imagine she tried it herself. This is the worst mouthwash we ever experienced. Also, contains hydrogen peroxide so your mouth continues to foam after two rinses. It is intended to be a strong product but the mint flavor+Listerine+foam action&#x3D;extremely unpleasant experience.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be too strong tasting, but after four uses, it put blisters on my lips &amp; gums.  Plus, it leaves an unpleasant foam in the back of your throat that won&#x27;t rinse away.  I&#x27;ve never been sensitive to other mouthwash products.  Seriously, did anyone doing the formulation on this try it themselves?!  I just poured it down the drain in hopes my $7 spent on it would have the benefit of cleaning the sink drain.</li>
    <li> though harsh this will whiten your teeth and freshen your breath. To down grade the product for the harshness is to be illogical and untrue.</li>
    <li> I ordere this by accident thinking it was the regular Listerine Total Care. When I discovered by error, I decided to give it a try. How bad could it be? It tastes awful. After you rinse, a nasty foam continues to foam up in your mouth. Making you want to spit for a  hour after rinsing. I would never order this again and going to dump this.</li>
    <li> This is way different than a previous mouth wash i&#x27;ve used.... I feel like I have rabies when I use this haha. It creates a silly amount of foam, swishing the right amount is critical with this stuff. I&#x27;m not looking for the whitening benefits, simply a better care for the teeth and gums, It feels like its working well. I would suggest this to a friend, family member, or a stranger to try out. It does create a bit of that &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; sensation some people try to avoid, while others seek because they then &amp;#34;know&amp;#34; its working.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  I tried Listerine Total Care Plus Whitening for five days, and I started to notice that my mouth constantly tasted salty and my tongue felt slightly burnt.  Foods I ate tasted salty and so did my regular toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t mind the strong taste while swishing it around in my mouth, or the foaming part, but I can&#x27;t stand tasting salt all the time.  I will be tossing the rest of it out.  My teeth aren&#x27;t any whiter either.</li>
    <li> I do not get the poor reviews of this product.I have been using this,since it came on the scene.First of all,I like the taste,secondly,it really has made a difference in mine and my husband&#x27;s oral health,our dentist agreed.I buy this product in bulk,all the time,and I highly recommend it.Please don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews,try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for two weeks straight.  Gave up using it because my tongue was literally burned so badly that I could see bright red spots on my tongue, it was painful whenever anything touched those areas of my tongue.  I thought maybe that once my tongue healed I could use it again, maybe I just wasn&#x27;t used to the product.  Well, I tried again but after another day of a burned tongue, I finally decided the alleged benefits were not worth the pain.  I don&#x27;t know if I was allergic to a specific ingredient in the product.  I also didn&#x27;t notice any teeth whitening.  Never experienced this before with any other mouthwash.  And yes, swishing this stuff inside your mouth while foaming at the mouth for 60 seconds is not fun.  On the other hand, this stuff is great for hazing during rush week, testing your tolerance for pain or waterboarding terrorists.</li>
    <li> I bought this mouthwash about two and a half weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and right before I go to bed. And I have to say I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, after brushing my teeth I use the mouthwash and swish it around for about a minute. I&#x27;ve really got to say that I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth gain a shade or two of whiteness sense using it, and not to mention the feeling it gives you of having a clean and fresh mouth.    I&#x27;ve read some reviews on this product about how people don&#x27;t like how it stings their mouth and I can&#x27;t help but to laugh a little at these people for the simple fact that there acting like a bunch of eight year old kids, &#x27;Oh my god it burns my mouth soo bad wow I can&#x27;t take it this mouthwash is terrible.&#x27; Yeah this mouthwash will feel like it&#x27;s burning your mouth a little but it says right on the box twenty one percent alcohol that means it&#x27;s going to burn a little but that also means it&#x27;s going to really clean your mouth pretty well. There&#x27;s a reason it feels like it&#x27;s burning in your mouth and that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s working on killing all the germs in your mouth that like to hide in your gum line and on your tongue.    Please disregard all these overly exaggerated reviews of people saying it feels like fire or whatever, there is a little burning feeling but it&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I am writing a review for a mouthwash but this stuff is amazing if your goal is to whiten your teeth.  I mix this product with water in my water pic and in one week my teeth were noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> I originally got this for my 13-year-old who wanted to have a whitening mouthwash after he got his braces off as he thought his teeth looked a little dingy. But he passed it along to me as he found it too strong.  When I initially tried it, I did indeed find it a bit stronger than other whitening mouthwashes I had used. But I liked the refreshing tingle from the mint flavor. I did also detect the hydrogen peroxide. Normally I hate the peroxide taste (hence that is why I never seemed to have much success with strips since the peroxide pooling up in my mouth made me gag) but it was tolerable in this Listerine Total Care.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and my teeth do seem whiter. I take care not to eat or drink anything for an hour or so after using it, as well as making sure to use it at least a half hour before I go to bed. So far, so good! While I&#x27;ve never had my teeth professionally whitened, I do think this is a good product for me since I drink coffee and red wine.  Of course, it does freshen my mouth, but I would say it might be a bit strong for those are used to using traditional minty mouthwashes. If you&#x27;ve always used Listerine and like the strength of it, then this is a nice change as it&#x27;s not so medicinal.  I&#x27;ve always had pretty good checkups, with minimal cavities over the years, thanks to good genetics, as well as lots of brushing and flossing. However, my dentist says that my teeth aren&#x27;t as strong as they used to be, so I am hoping this does help. I can&#x27;t really say at this point whether it does or does not help in that regard.</li>
    <li> Is there such a thing as zero stars? It not only BURNS but also is far too \\&quot;foamy.\\&quot; Just a few swishes and it is so bubbly and foamy in the mouth it could almost be described as too thick to swish any longer. I actualy felt it made my gums more sensitive due to how bad it burned. I will no longer purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using regular Listerine for years but when got a coupon for this product I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I like the lavender bottle since it matches my bathroom decor. I like how clean my mouth feels after I use it - cleaner than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m apparently not allergic to it although it does make my mouth tingle a bit but not a burning sensation. I am allergic to almost every toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried but this product did not make my mouth peel or make my gums sore. In fact it pretty much did everything it promised. After a week of use my teeth did look whiter. I only drink one cup of coffee a day so not much to whiten. Now the only things this does that is a bit annoying is that it foams on your tongue. If you are going to buy this product do yourself a favor and get a tongue scraper as well. Once you spit this stuff out and rinse a bit you will need to scrape your tongue to get off all the foam. I think this is just from the hydrogen peroxide. I would not recommend this product for people with sensitive mouths. I take no responsibility for your health if you use this product. Use at own risk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> This tastes like that how that blue stuff in port-o-potties and RVs smells, mixed with a generic wannabe chemical mint that has rotted and molded. You&#x27;ll wanna get another mouthwash afterwards just to get this taste out of your mouth. Heck, you might even want to lick someone&#x27;s bunghole to get the taste out of your mouth it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
    <li> I buy this thinking that is would be good but I got a bad experience.&lt;br /&gt;I use colgate Total Toothpaste because I like the way it keep my mouth Fresh whole day and even in the morning when I wake up. Remember the old days when there was that nasty taste when you wake up? Thank God for Colgate Total Toothpaste. Now seeing my mum using Listerine, I decided to buy one and I went with this seeing how many good stuff it offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review after less than one week of use:&lt;br /&gt;-It taste bad.&lt;br /&gt;-It burn a little like all Listerine does.&lt;br /&gt;-Before you spit if out, it foam up in your mouth and there is nothing more to do than spit it out.&lt;br /&gt;-When you spit it out, because of the foam, your whole mouth and tongue is all white and still have the foam and bad taste that you have to rinse your mouth over and over again and brush your tongue again.&lt;br /&gt;-During the day and in the morning, I got a bad taste in my mouth like if my teeth is decaying or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I stop, all the bad taste when away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will go with the original Yellow Listerine. It burn but I rather have a fresh mouth than a bad tasting mouth that might have a bad smell.</li>
    <li> I affectionately refer to this product as Battery Acid.  Yes, it burns.  It burns worse than anything else.  It took me a month of continuous use to stop getting all watery-eyed after 60 seconds (not only does it burn more, but you have to use it for twice as long as regular Listerine).    But boy let me tell you, this stuff works.  The whitening works really well, I&#x27;d say just as good as the Crest whitestrips or better (having tried those a couple years ago).  And my teeth have never felt cleaner.  If you&#x27;re uninsured and don&#x27;t go to the dentist very often, this is your new insurance.  It does a serious job.  Man up and get used to the burn.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I like it so far.  Been using it 4 days.  No black tongue or gums falling apart.  Perhaps they modified the formula.&lt;br /&gt;It stings less than regular Listerine.  After 40 seconds of using it you feel the foaming.  A little bit of yucky taste afterwards like toothpaste.  It says not to eat or drink for 30 minutes after using but if you just brushed your teeth also you do not want to eat soon anways.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 days its too early to tell if the stain remover is effective.</li>
    <li> I like this product and feel that it has improved my dental appointments. It makes my teeth feel and look good.  However I am disappointed that the last time I purchased this I got 1L and this time only 946ml.  They raise prices by providing less product.  That type of price manipulation should not be tolerated.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t burn any worse then the other Listerine&#x27;s and the effect on my mouth and gums are great. I will probably order another soon to put aside so I will always have it available.</li>
    <li> It seriously tastes like the last nasty hit off a crack pipe. Totally terrible. It foams up in your mouth and is nasty. I would give this product to my worst enemy. It also burns like a mofo. Don&#x27;t use this garbage. (This is a description a man gave me at Walgreens, i don&#x27;t actually smoke crack but he did. I did use this product and it sucked, but I thought his words were a great description)</li>
    <li> I have used Listerine for years and never really minded the taste or the burn.  I tried the Pro Health ones and found it was staining my teeth if you can believe that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find this product and figured it would do the job but be less abrasive than the full strength ones by the same name.  Boy was I surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product tastes so bad and burns my mouth so badly I can only use it for less than 10 seconds.  I am pretty sure paint thinner tastes better.  I do not think I will purchase another bottle of this stuff.  It really is painful to use and I hate to throw it away but I will be most happy when I am finished with it and can purchase something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
    <li> My favorite and nicely priced</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always happy with Listerine. I use it twice a day before brushing, and it seems to make a difference.</li>
    <li> All Listerine products are good.  I particularly like this one because it foams up and leaves some foam behind after finished rinsing to continue working.  It may be strong, but it sure does the job!</li>
    <li> Strong. but doesn&#x27;t burn. A great mouthwash, really leaves my mouth smelling and feeling clean all around.</li>
    <li> OK, I bought Listerine Total Care because I had my teeth whitened at the dentist and was told to stay away from coffee, tea, wine and citrus juices.  Well, I could not totally abstain from coffee or wine.  Read that this product helped rebuild enamel and whitened teeth so I thought I should get it.  The first time I used it was the day after I finished with the whitening process and I thought my mouth was on fire. My eyes were watering and I needed to spit the mouthwash out.  I have used this mouthwash for about 2 weeks and the other day I started noticing that I wasn&#x27;t tasting my food that well.  Went out to a very nice restaurant and I was the only person who thought the food was bland.  Then I noticed that sandwiches that I always make and like had no taste. Decided I would read the reviews today and I am discovering that a great deal of people are complaining about taste buds being desensitized.  It does foam a great deal, but that does not bother me.  I am just concerned that I am burning my tongue.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great taste, recommended by dentist, better price than big box stores. Not too sure about the whitening claim, but will wait and see.</li>
    <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s very difficult to find something that both whitens your teeth &amp; repairs enamel.  Only thing that sucks is having to wait 1/2 an hour to eat or drink anything.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try the new Total care instead of the pre-brush and post-brush Listerine....OUCH.  This stuff hurts!...and after continuing to use for 2 weeks because I thought hurt meant killing germs, I have 2 sores on my gums!  AVOID!</li>
    <li> I am a great fan of Listerine Original Antiseptic mouthwash, which I have used daily for years, and of Listerine Whitening Original, which I use when I remember to.  I like the clean feeling that the Original Antiseptic mouthwash leaves me with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Listerine Total Care Whitening mouthwash as a free sample, and found the taste repulsive.  Not just bad, but horribly bad.  There is clearly some ingredient in it which does not suit my taste and may not suit yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend trying the Listerine range of products but, given that this item is not cheap, you might avoid it unless you can get a free trial taste of it first.</li>
    <li> This does a great job in fighting cavities and whitening teeth. Best all-around rinse out there. Sorta of a weird foamy after-taste but tolerable.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I have used this particular Listerine  over a year, and have mostly used Listerine brand throughout my life.  The main benefit to me is much better morning breath. It is the only thing I have found that offers me that benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What others complain about is true for me as well, but I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is, since it gives me fresher breath and whiter teeth.(my teeth were pretty white to begin with)  I don&#x27;t use it every day though, just a few nights a week. I rinse for 1-2 minute(s) after brushing, before bed.The other times I use both alcohol or non-alcohol,l non-whitening Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were sensitive the first few times a tried it, but no longer sensitive to it. I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad. This bottle does have an anti-septic taste, which I assume is the hydrogen peroxide.(H2O2) Dentists debate among themselves whether there is any benefit to H202 in broad oral uses, and is it harmful to teeth and/or gums. Since they have not settled it, I won&#x27;t claim its efficacy in any of its forms. I have tried rinsing my mouth with the regular brown bottle of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and it taste better than this Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, no negative side effects from using this Listerine.  Is there something better? Don&#x27;t know, I have not found it, and I have tried most things.The bottle says use up to two times per day, No way, I would do that.</li>
    <li> Listerine is still the best brand of mouthwash and this product is the best of the listerine mouthwash products. We will definitely be ordering this again as we have before.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. Since using it, my teeth feel stronger, stay plaque-free longer, and look whiter. However, as other&#x27;s have mentioned, there is one particularly bad thing about this mouthwash: it burns like hell. Compared to other mouthwash&#x27;s with similar alcohol levels, this one burns much more. I can&#x27;t say why exactly, but I&#x27;m willing to bet it&#x27;s due to the whitening ingredient. Needless to say, the burn is something else, especially if you have any, and I mean ANY, cuts or sores in your mouth. Aside from the burn, it works fantastically, but some people seem to actually have damage done to them by this stuff, so maybe I just have a strong mouth.   Use with caution, but if you can handle it, it&#x27;s the best stuff you can get.</li>
    <li> I had been using \\&quot;green\\&quot; Listerine for a few months, and at my most recent dental appointment my dentist recommended that i switch to ACT fluoridated mouth wash.  After that recommendation, i was talking to my dental hygienist, who recommended Listerine total care.  It would provide the same gum protection as my green Listerine, with the fluoride that my dentist recommended.  When i was looking into getting the Listerine total care, i saw the \\&quot;plus whitening\\&quot; option, and figure i would give it a try.  I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinking, and my oral hygiene has, up until about a year ago been fairly poor.  However, this whitening mouthwash has done a great job of getting rid of the yellowing.  My dentist was also quite pleased with the effects of the fluoride.  My only dislike with this product is that it leaves my mouth with a lot of \\&quot;foam\\&quot; when I&#x27;m finished using it.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is a specific reaction for me, or if others have noticed it.  Still the benefits far outweigh having to spit a few extra times after I&#x27;m done rinsing.</li>
    <li> Did not like this. Continue to use since I hate to waste it. But taste is terrible, it foams around my sensitive teeth causing discomfort. Stick with the regular Listerine and grab some Crest White Strips for extra whitening.</li>
    <li> Horrible taste. Couldn&#x27;t manage it. Had to toss it out. Stick with the non stain remover type.</li>
    <li> I seldom leave review, but this product created huge problem on my gum after just two or three usages. Listerine should stop selling this Mouthwash!!</li>
    <li> I got this stuff because the CVS was out of the purple listerine I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not too sensitive to things tasting bad or being strong, but this stuff is awful.  It smells like cleaning bucket water and tastes similar.  The foaming, awful tasting mouth afterwards caused me to have to rinse multiple times, though that is contrary to effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that after a few weeks of use I developed \\&quot;Black Hairy Tongue\\&quot; from the peroxide in the formula.  It felt like the back of my tongue was swollen and covered in felt, and the rest was, well... black and hairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with this stuff.  It&#x27;s not worth the potential side effects.</li>
    <li> I usually use the regular purple Listerine. It tastes great and I haven&#x27;t had cavities in years. I have been told that I don&#x27;t have very good enamel. I grew up on well-water and my parents neglected to give me fluoride vitamins. I saw this at the grocery store and thought I would give it a try. My teeth don&#x27;t really need to be whitened, but I figured why not. I have used it the past three days and my teeth are ACHING. If you have sensitive teeth, stay clear of this one!!!</li>
    <li> after taste a bit weird than the listerine total, but overall good product. I would say the listerine total (Without Whitening) is much better tasting. Same listerine burn as other versions. I like the burn, that way i knowits working.</li>
    <li> Difficult to find any more. LOVE this product and highly touted by my dentist. WHY is it not available in the 32 oz size any longer?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experience burning, but the taste of this is just...weird. It tastes like if you downed a gallon of vinegar then swam with your tongue out in chlorine. You will not be eating/drinking anything after using this product. Also, I know this is a bit immature, but the foaming did get to me a little bit. Goes in a clear liquid, comes out a sticky white foam of horrific bitterness.</li>
    <li> This stuff works to make your teeth whiter.  It&#x27;s basically peroxide so if you use it after brushing (as suggested), it feels kind of bubbly and gross. I use it before flossing/bushing and it&#x27;s good. Does cause some tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m unfortunately predisposed to cavities because of my deep tooth grooves. The Listerine Total Care, along with using my Sonicare brush, has finally given me 2 cavity free dentist visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To join the chorus of other comments, this stuff absolutely burns and produces an abundance of foam. I started off with the original total care Listerine, and switched to this. My tongue and mouth were on FIRE, and I was so confused by the foam. Read the ingredients, and a lightbulb went off when I saw the peroxide. I eventually became used to the burn, but even time doesn&#x27;t totally take away the burn. It is all worth it though, as this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has this contributed to less cavities, but it has brightened my smile significantly! I have been using a whitening toothpaste for years and they didn&#x27;t help as much as I wanted. This mouthwash definitely helped using it at least 1x a day, and my teeth are so much brighter. As others have stated, this works well as a combination regimen. I think you&#x27;ll see optimum results using this with a whitening toothbrush as well as lessening the consumption of staining food/drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Listerine never stops making this!</li>
    <li> This stuff does will whiten and clean your teeth.  After using it for a week though and dealing with the burn, I can&#x27;t taste food anymore; even in my daily life, hours after I&#x27;ve used it.  I hope this wears off.</li>
    <li> I have always used Listerine. I just found out they test on animals.... so this will be my last bottle.</li>
    <li> If you have a stuffy nose, all you need to do is rinse w/some of this stuff! Wow. Red face, watery eyes, runny nose, mouth on [fire].. these are all things you can expect when starting 2use this moutmouthwash. However afterwards, your breath will feel beyond fresh &amp; your mouth beyond clean. The harshness of the taste deff lessens as you use it more &amp; it even feels good, super clean! I highly recommend this product!👍</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Anything to help me keep my spending $ at the dentist is a plus in my book.  The whitening also works as promised after 2 or 3 months.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite mouth wash! It has hydrogen peroxide in it which is a natural stain remover. We wanted a mouth wash without alcohol in it and this is it!</li>
    <li> Its tough to keep it in your mouth for 30 seconds. It really burns. I take the burning as a good thing. Killing any germs. I usually use if before bed. Very rarely wake up with morning breath any more.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the purple Total Care Listerine that you find in stores. This is a Purple, non-transparent bottle that hides the fact that the mouthwash is actually clear. I&#x27;ve used the purple total care Listerine before and love it and am pretty upset that this isn&#x27;t the same despite being advertised as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear Listerine that tastes foul, unlike any Listerine that I&#x27;ve tried before, and produces a disgusting foam after use.</li>
    <li> Great listerine product. Leaves your mouth fresh and clean. Higher quality product than normal listerine, but out an unbelievable value. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful! It&#x27;s like rinsing with mint flavored peroxide. It filled my mouth with foam and left a coating in my mouth. Total Care is a total waste of money. I hate to throw money away, but this gets tossed. I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would sell this nasty stuff.</li>
    <li> This is my go to mouthwash! It hardens the soft spots while whitening! I couldn&#x27;t ask for better results!</li>
    <li> I have always used Listerine but never this version until recently. On a whim, I bought this one instead because several coffees a day and the occasional bottle of red wine were leaving my teeth rather... un-white. After using it for just a week, twice a day, for as close to a minute as possible (probably  more like 20 seconds!), my teeth are noticeably several shades whiter -- more than any white strips have ever managed, and for much less money. It&#x27;s really impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn&#x27;t taste like candy. (It is probably the worst-tasting Listerine out of many bad-tasting Listerines.) And yes, it leaves foam in your mouth because of the hydrogen peroxide. It also dries my lips out and I have to immediately pile on some lip balm. But the bottom line is that it works, more than well. No pain, no gain, right?</li>
    <li> Stick to Listerine. The taste of this is disgusting. My wife also says it&#x27;s unbearable. Plus you must swish it around 1 minute while original Listerine is only 30 seconds. I used it for about the 6th and final time 30 minutes ago or so and the taste is still there. According to the instructions I can now finally wash that taste out. You have to wait 30 minutes after use to rinse or drink or eat.</li>
    <li> As several other reviewers have already mentioned, I have also developed black hairy tongue after using this product twice a day for about 40 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not care much about strong taste of the product, but after a few days of use I started feeling a strange taste all the time on my tongue deep in my throat. I would say it tastes like dried kelp, while the other reviewers expressed it as \\&quot;metal taste\\&quot; and \\&quot;bucket water\\&quot;. After 4 weeks of use, I felt my tongue was burnt and could not taste foods well. After 5 weeks of use, I have some pain on my tongue. When I saw my tongue with a mirror, I found a large part of my tongue is almost black! I guess not all people suffer from the side effects but it seems pretty common. I googled this issue, and at least 5 people reported very similar symptoms with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its whitening function is also disappointing. After 40 days of use, I have NOT noticed any change at all for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is too risky and has no perceived benefits over regular Listerine. I recommend a regular one (I have used Cool Mint for a couple of years).</li>
    <li> Yuck.  I am a big fan of the non-whitening fresh mint (regular not zero version).  I ordered this one by mistake thinking it was the regular fresh mint.  The flavor of the whitening version is dramatically different (yuck).  It is dominated by the hydrogen peroxide which makes it a medicine taste.  As others noted,  you will be spitting out foam due to the hydrogen peroxide.  I will tough it out through the rest of the bottle (ugh)  but I will not buy the whitening version ever again (on purpose).  Listerine should update the label so that it is more apparent which version you are viewing (regular,  zero,  whitening).  I know the bottle says it but it is quite easy to miss.</li>
    <li> I guess I have been lucky with this product. I have not had any issues using this mouthwash. I like that there seems to be a white foam layer across my tongue after I spit the mouthwash out. The white foam/slim is easily removed by the tongue cleaner on the back of my toothbrush. Removing the foam takes all the tongue grime away easily and quickly. This is great for me since I do smoke and tongue slime is a thing. My teeth do look fairly white considering I smoke and drink coffee daily. My husband who also smokes and drinks hates this product. I don&#x27;t think he can stand the taste more than anything.  I have gone through 4 bottles and I am still purchasing it. I like it.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are addicted to this mouthwash. My husband likes any mouth care products that use natural products like hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and so on.  That&#x27;s why we originally got this mouthwash.  Now, after using it the first time, we can&#x27;t use any other kind.  We just really like the features of this one!  No others are like it!  We love the taste, we love the way the bubbles fizz at the end of the rinse, we love the lasting freshness after using.  We don&#x27;t like to use anything with fake coloring in it... like what&#x27;s the point?!?! This mouthwash is clear, simple and super-effective.  That being said, it all depends on what you like. So, if you&#x27;re like us...you&#x27;ll like this product!</li>
    <li> this review is for the with whitening version of this product. If you dont like the BURN then dont get the whitening one. It not only has a serious burn and isnt for sensitive gums but it has a fine foam that never ends and it will make you nausious if you have a sensitive stomach. I have neither sensitive gums or stomach and want my mouthwash to incinerate everything in its path. For me, this stuff is the bomb.</li>
    <li> I buy this over and over again, why because I trust it, it&#x27;s got 6 benifits  in one plus whitening, great price..</li>
    <li> This is a great mouthwash..does what it says it will... it has a little bite to it,, but it is very refreshing..</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people who should invest in this. Their breath makes me want to look away from them, but that&#x27;s rude. Right? Yeah.. I don&#x27;t care. I look away anyway or step back about 20&#x27;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good for the price.  What I expected.</li>
    <li> The bottle was not wrapped well and leaked in the box. The notice said that would not be covered and could not be returned.  Lesson learned, don&#x27;t order heavy liquid items  that can be damaged in transport.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else since I&#x27;ve found this</li>
    <li> This mouthwash worked well, but it dried out my throat severely. I would not recommend it to anyone who has problems with dry throats.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this product. It burns when you use it and leaves your mouth sore. I also called the company with concerns of a Phosphoric acid in the ingredients.  Acid shouldn&#x27;t be used to help \\&quot;restore your enamel\\&quot;  The costumer service rep told me the PH is 3.0-4.0 that&#x27;s like rinsing your mouth with soda or orange juice. That can&#x27;t be good for your teeth.</li>
    <li> The fresh mint mouthwash is a good value but it does have its drawbacks. After using the product make sure to rinse the cap or in time it will leak product on the container leaving white streaks, the whitening effect is less than perfect but does provide a little improvement, just do not expect this product to whiten your teeth at this price. There is not much of a mouth burn like other products similiar to this on, but it does have its sting be it minor.&lt;br /&gt;Again, for the price you pay expect a little above average for usage but not a major improvement over time.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is okay but the value is questionable.  I have had as good experiences with generic Target-branded whitening mouthwash at much lower cost.</li>
    <li> Its Listerine, this company has been around longer than most of us have been alive.  It fights bad breath and hopefully helps fight tooth decay.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This has left my teeth whiter and my breath fresher. I have never loved the taste of mouthwash. This one does have a stronger, more potent taste than some mouthwashes but give it a chance. I always thought only whitestrips or  a dentist can whiten teeth effectively. This was the first time a mouthwash has whitened my teeth effectively. I also love how fresh my breath is after using it. I think the foam allows it to reach more of the hard to reach bacteria in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who worry about the taste; you get used to it quickly. I think it is strong because it does more than a regular mouthwash. Sometimes I just use the mouthwash at night when I&#x27;m tired. It makes my mouth feel clean enough so that I don&#x27;t even feel bad about not brushing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful!  It burned my gums!  Don&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> and if you think you might enjoy having your mouth inexplicably filling with foam even twelve hours after using it, then this is definitely the mouthwash for you.</li>
    <li> This is my first review, BEWARE of the nasty taste it leaves in your mouth. It literally taste liquified rotted meat. The texture is also gross, it leaves a nasty milky white film in your mouth. I will never purchase this again! Listerine, you should know better.</li>
    <li> Too foamy and tastes weird. Also leaves an after taste. Go with the regular listerine which is much better. I am generally concerned about the chemicals they use in these whitening products and their possible effect on tooth enamel.</li>
    <li> Worst Tasting mouthwash ever. I hope it is working well but I will never buy it again just because of the taste.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my dentist recommended getting a rinse that rebuilt enamel. I was looking for a product that did that as well as whitened. After using this nightly for the six months between dental appointments, my dentist informed me that the soft spots in my teeth had strengthened and were no longer at risk for cavities. I definitely noticed the whitening aspect as well. For those looking for that strong Listerine burn/mint, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. It&#x27;s much milder and doesn&#x27;t have the strong mint flavor and scent of other Listerine. I would suggest buying this in addition to a regular mouthwash for breath freshening and switch off morning and evening, as you can&#x27;t eat or drink anything for a half hour after using the whitening rinse for it to be most effective.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite mouthwash. I use it only at night, and I never wake up with scary morning breath. Also, despite being a regular tea/coffee/wine drinker, using this has kept my teeth looking bright white. Even my dentist commented that my teeth were very white!</li>
    <li> This one is the best. Has Hydrogen Peroxide and is the best I have tried. I will use and reorder this as long ad it is produced.</li>
    <li> Formula really burns, makes the orginal Listerine product child&#x27;s play, not to mention the viscous material that forms after swishing for the required minute. Reason I keep using the Total is that it works. Actually had to switch back to the regular Listerine when my Total ran out and my mouth just didn&#x27;t feel the same cleanliness or brightness that the Total is able to produce. Directions say to wait a hakf an hour beofre eating or drinking, do this otherwise your meal or drink will not taste right. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Nasty.  Leaves weird white mucus slime in mouth about an hour later.  DO NOT USE!</li>
    <li> When my dental hygienist recommended Listerine Total Care I said no way. I have never been able to tolerate the taste of any Listerine product in the past. She encouraged me to try \\&quot;the one in the purple bottle\\&quot; so I promised I would but said I was sure I wouldn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Total Care Plus Whitening and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed the whitening effects yet but I&#x27;m assuming it happens gradually over time. Don&#x27;t know how it \\&quot;builds enamel\\&quot; or how one would know if it was happening so I can&#x27;t speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, it really is the first Listerine mouthwash I&#x27;ve liked. The taste is very strong but does not have Listerine&#x27;s typical underlying taste (you know--the flavor that is how you would imagine a pine-scented floor cleaner might taste). This flavor is strong mint but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does burn, no getting around that, but I have not had the extreme reaction that some have reported. I like the burn because it feels like it is really cleansing my mouth. Maybe the burning sensation on the tongue is what prevents the tastebuds from detecting the old listerine flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it foams because of the peroxide and the foam builds the longer you rinse. Here&#x27;s a tip--lean forward over the sink as you rinse and it won&#x27;t feel overwhelming in your mouth and you can spit it out fast if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that my mouth tastes and feels cleaner and my breath stays fresher a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing--I purchased this product from Amazon because they offer free shipping and because many of the stores in my area do not carry the Total Care Plus Whitening, only the regular Total Care. The ones I&#x27;ve found that do sell it only have a smaller size bottle for almost the same price as the large one offered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> After a few seconds, this stuff has a thick, foamy, milky-like consistency that coats the mouth and tongue.  I used it every day for a week but found it so disgusting that I just dumped the rest down the drain.</li>
    <li> Not as bad as some reviewers say.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is going to be gone in a few mins</li>
    <li> The cap broke and couldn&#x27;t go back on.I could smell the scent of the mouthwash even before I open the package. Now I couldn&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s flammable and the cap doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Disappointed....I hope someone could tell me what to do....</li>
    <li> This stuff is just weird. The texture is off for me. I thought it was the other, more translucent purple Listerine when I purchased it. Perhaps some people like the effect, but I prefer something a bit more palatable. I don&#x27;t think it has to taste like this or be so foamy to work effectively.</li>
    <li> I have to lead by example when it comes to my kids, so when the dentist recommended a daily fluoride rinse for them, I picked up a rinse for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are to rinse with this product for one full minute, twice a day, after brushing.  I can barely manage once a day because the experience is so terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the &amp;#34;fresh mint&amp;#34; flavor tastes absolutely nothing at all like mint. Nothing.  At.  All.  The taste of this product is just plain BAD. It&#x27;s awful. I&#x27;d have taken a &amp;#34;fresh grape&amp;#34; with the purple package and all, but it just tastes like a lab experiment gone wrong...not that I ever rinsed with my chem experiments, but clearly the research team was checked out when they tested the flavor of this rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, and this is typical of any Listerine use for me, about 30 seconds in my mouth starts to burn. But I swish through the pain to get to my full 60. I mean, if it hurts it must be doing something, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to third, I can take the burn. I&#x27;m tough. But what I absolutely cannot stand is the foaming at the mouth that this product causes. I foam. I spit. I foam some more. I spit again. That horrid taste won&#x27;t go away. I just keep foaming and spitting and foaming and spitting and all I want to do is rinse my mouth with water, but I can&#x27;t becuse the instructions say not to eat or drink for 30 minutes after using the rinse!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have to ask myself...why is this still on my counter? Is it because I&#x27;m too cheap to throw it out and buy something else? Is it because I&#x27;m stubborn and refuse to let Listerine defeat me? Maybe it&#x27;s a little of both.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned when I saw how many people complained about the burning. I tried it and the first few times, it did burn. Was it bad? Not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is mouthwash that is designed to kill germs and maintain oral health. I have noticed that I have gotten used to it and now it is more of a tingling than a burning, but it has been a couple of weeks. I like this product and in my experience, the mild discomfort is brief and well worth the benefits of a mouthwash that works well and whitens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those concerned about the burn: try it out and you will see that it really isn&#x27;t that bad. This product deserves better than to be blasted by people who are unwilling to endure mild discomfort for the overall greater health of their teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Total Care\\&quot; advertises the things that standard Listerine is usually known for. However this product is not ADA certified. Whether that matters to you or not is another issue. I&#x27;ve used it and I didn&#x27;t mind the taste even if it was very intense, but the ingredients are not the same as regular Listerine. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing or bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to stay on the straight and narrow and buy the ADA certified Listerine. I know what it does and it helps me with good check ups.</li>
    <li> Gosh, when my husband and I use this stuff, we feel like we are having a conversation in Hell. That is how hot this stuff gets. BUT, it downs whiten teeth and help people with bad breath problems. Plus it leaves your teeth feeling clean all day.</li>
    <li> Never want to try this with alcohol content. Feels like the fire in the mouth!&lt;br /&gt;terrible burning, too much alcohol inside</li>
    <li> If you like listerine this is a good product</li>
    <li> Ok, I have been using it a couple of days now, and yes it tastes bad, and you foam at the mouth like a rabid dog. and it burns like hell.  but I was ok with this until....it started to really burn my mouth...hmmmm I thought ok, it must be strong.....well now the inside of my cheeks and gums are raw!  i can even eat!  this stuff has literally eaten away mt skin!  this should not be on the market. I have some serious damage!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive, but after only 3 days of using this product, my mouth is horribly burned! After the first use, I noticed that some spots in my mouth were sore, as if I had canker sores. For whatever reason, I didn&#x27;t think the soreness was a result of the mouthwash and continued to use the product. The second day using the mouthwash, I noticed that the sore spots really burned... so did some new spots. I spit the mouthwash out after about 10 seconds of use and immediately rinsed with cold water. Upon inspecting my mouth, I noticed some red spots and some white patches. I thought, ok... maybe I need to dillute the mouthwash with water. The next time I used the mouthwash, I did just that and it burned again! At that point, I decided that I would no longer use this mouthwash.  My husband has been using the mouthwash too and he hasn&#x27;t had a problem with it... he likes it. Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying the product just to find out that you are sensitive too.</li>
    <li> THIS MOUTHWASH HAS MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE IN MY TEETH.. NO MORE TEA STAINS AND THIS  HAS 6 BENEFITS..1- HELPS PREVENT CAVITIES&amp;#62;2-STENGTHENS TEETH&amp;#62;3- KILLS BAD BREATH&amp;#62;4-CLEANS THE WHOLE MOUTH&amp;#62;5-RESTORES ENAMEL&amp;#62;6-FRESHENS BREATH &amp;#62;PLUS WHITENS TEETH... WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR !!!  I DO RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I love it! It is a bit rough for the inexperienced Listerine user, but is worth it thus far.&lt;br /&gt;It is challenging not to rinse with water immediately after use because of the foam build up and stinging burn that Listerine is known for, but suck it up and let it work. I noticed an immediate pearl shine after my 1st rinse and a clean between my teeth that lasts all day even after eating, well into the evening with a fresh clean.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even use it as directed for twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash really does work well. It burns slightly, but I&#x27;m not swishing water here -- it&#x27;s mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it does foam a lot. Not usually an issue but sometimes I put this into my waterpik and the foaming is a little annoying :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, our current favorite and with Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, easy and a great value.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist. I however am Lazy and could not be bothered to make a trip just for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prime had it at my door fast and I did not have to spend time searching the pharmacy to use the dentist coupon as amazon had the same one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit intense to use but does the job.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, and it works well, but basically what you are paying for is the hydrogen peroxide. Bottle is opaque to keep the peroxide from going bad. I&#x27;ve since transitioned from this to a rinse using a 50/50 mix of water and hydrogen peroxide, followed by a rinse of normal Listerine. Also brush with a mix of baking soda and peroxide ~once per month.</li>
    <li> For all the people who say that the burn is worth it for the result, they better be careful. I used this product for a few weeks, and every time I used it I had to deal with unbearable burning, but my teeth looked great. I kept using it...a HUGE mistake. Today I had to go to an emergency dentist appointment to get treated for the CHEMICAL BURNS that the high content of alcohol caused. It is by no means worth it! There are so many good mouthwashes out there, this is not one of them. If you want increased gum sensitivity, increased gum bleeding, and chemical burns, then go for it, but it is a BIG mistake to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Amazon untested, assuming foolishly that the term \\&quot;total care\\&quot; means the product has been proven safe and effective for the human mouth. The moment that first swig of&lt;br /&gt;searing, napalm-like fluid hit my palate, releasing an audible frying sound and the flavor of 5,000 mothballs swimming in Everclear, I&lt;br /&gt;realized Listerine had a loose cannon or two in its research centers. Perhaps an interrogator weary of waterboarding and seeking a new gig that also combined  torture with hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to expel the fluid shortly before it permanently dissolved my tongue and gumline, but the cruel sting and industrial-solvent aroma lingered for hours, making me long for run-of-the-mill chicken Marsala breath that at least doesn&#x27;t raise real flammability concerns each time I belch.</li>
    <li> Trust the 1 star reviews here.  This really hurt me a lot.  Blisters, Sores and More.  Gave me real issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a chef, a saucier, one of those freaks that gourmands (total foodies in my language) refer to as one with a high palate. No, I can&#x27;t particularly taste other things very well after using this in the morning--it takes til about mid way through my 1st cup of coffee. So what? My teeth and mouth and gums are so much better--and this product is great for taking off stains left behind by wines, red and purple fruits and vegetables, teas, coffees and assorted spirits that are part of my daily experiences. All of these reasons, plus the fact that my mouth feels really clean afterward tell me that this product works for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what scares me most: the, I assume, chick who bought this product because it, and I&#x27;m quoting, \\&quot;is in a bottle that matched her bathroom decor\\&quot; (we&#x27;re buying mouthwash because it&#x27;s in our color scheme?) or that the Navy SEAL program takes guys who apparently are such candy asses they can&#x27;t handle mouthwash. Does it sting a bit? Yes. That&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s mouthwash, folks, not Hershey&#x27;s syrup. At any rate, if you want white teeth and fresh breath, use this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it for 10 days and can tell the whitening difference. I had my teeth bleached a year ago. I use trays weekly for maintaining the white color. I chew whitening gum and use whitening toothpaste and this stuff and it absolutely makes a difference. While I don&#x27;t smoke, I drink coffee every morning and chug tea most of the day. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried to buy 4 different store brands / generic...dont do it!  Listerine just does it right!  I take care of my teeth and gums and this stuff really helps!</li>
    <li> it kills everything in your nasty mouth.  And you know it is working because the peroxide makes all your nastiness turn white and bubble</li>
    <li> Siempre uso el listerine verde quise cambiar esta vez la frescura no es la misma que el que uso normalmente y. No es un sabor muy tolerable lo que me parece mas raro es la sensación que deja en la lengua luego de utilizarlo primera vez que me ocurre con el listerine</li>
    <li> I like literally thousands of other people experienced burning and severe damage to my mucosa after using this product just once. I was able to keep the mouthwash in my mouth for about 20 seconds and could no longer handle the burn. Then over the next 24 hours experienced necrotization of my inner gum tissues on the left side of my cheek. The next morning when i woke up with severe mouth pain I looked in the mirror and had a large crater the size of a half dollar where the skin was literally missing. Like a giant canker sore. I went to the emergency room were they informed me I had a bad second degree chemical burn that had damaged one of my salivary ducts and would require a skin graft to prevent infection. Three and a half months later it is not fully healed. My dentist said she has seen many many people have this reaction to this perticular mouthwash and strongly recommends against using it. The chemicals used in this mouthwash are outlawed in most other countries. Maybe there is a reason for that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a heavy chain smoker and I also drink coffee everyday. My teeth have been fairly sensitive in recent years. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can both strengthen my teeth and whiten them. This is definitely the best choice.  It&#x27;s true that this mouthwash produced an extreme burning sensation at first, but that subsides with regular use. It also definitely strengthens teeth. In fact, I experience little sensitivity to any kind of food or drink after having used this. It has significantly improved the color of my teeth.  I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash every morning and night for 3 months. My teeth feel much, much stronger, I have no plaque issues, my mouth is always clean and my breath fresh, and my smile is a few shades whiter. I recommend this to anyone concerned with their smile!</li>
    <li> I began using Listerine Total Care on the recommendation of my dentist to whiten my teeth and for added flouride. Yes... it burns but I enjoyed the fresh breath and clean feeling after. Unfortunately, I could only use it for about 3 weeks. After a week of everyday use, I started to notice I would wake up with a film in my mouth. Turns out, the mouth wash has been burning a layer of my skin off. Ew doesn&#x27;t quite cover it. I tried switching mouth washes to something a little less strong, same thing happens. If you&#x27;re sensitive to alcohol mouthwashes, you might consider something a little tamer.</li>
    <li> All in one bottle.  It does a great job of cleaning and isn&#x27;t too strong.  I will definitely  buy again.</li>
    <li> Edit: Listerine currently links reviews for multiple products--some that contain alcohol and others that do not. This review is for the Total Care Stain Remover, Fresh Mint, 32 ounce that includes alcohol in the ingredients.There may or may not be this information included above the review with a link to the product page. This just depends on where and how you are reading this review.  As others have said, and to agree with them, this product is strong (21.6% alcohol), but if you can handle the strength, it works well. Something worth noting other than the strength of the product that creates a burning sensation is that after swishing (the product suggests for a minute that you will probably have to work up to due to the strength), the mouthwash turns into a white foamy substance in your mouth. It isn’t as pleasant as other mouthwashes as it’s more difficult to expel but just spit it all out (I rake my top teeth over my tongue to help get most of it out). With that said, after using the product, my mouth feels amazing and fresh up until I eat or drink coffee. :]  To address a common complaint, there are those who claim this mouthwash has killed the top layer of skin in their mouths or other odd issues; I’ve never had any of these issues, but I also love spicy foods (e.g., hot sauces). It&#x27;s possible that people who find ketchup or mild salsas as spicy have sensitive mouths that get harmed using such a strong product…or it could be something else as this is just an observation.  Never the less, after I quit smoking, I started using this mouthwash to help aid in getting rid of some of the stains that had built up over the last 15 years or so. I’ve been using it for around a year now with a whitening toothpaste (Crest 3D White) and daily flossing (Oral-B Glide). Since using this product I’ve noticed my teeth are a few shades whiter. Friends and family have also agreed that my teeth are not as stained as they used to be. So I would highly recommend this product if you have no issues with other strong products such as hot sauces, alcohol, or even regular mouth wash. If you think or know you have a sensitive mouth, I believe there is an alcohol-free version of this mouthwash that might even share the same comments (I noticed some people thought these posts were supposed to be for the alcohol-free one, but the picture for the product I have bought and am reviewing clearly shows the ingredient label that lists alcohol). *I will update this if anything changes, but after around a year I’m still buying this same mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Gia wrote a great review about the science behind this mouthwash, which I&#x27;d recommend you read. I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for almost 2 years, so I&#x27;ll give my take on how it feels to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely has a burn. Tolerable, though, and it becomes easier with time. Interestingly, I found that consumption of balsamic vinegar with dinner beforehand makes the burning much worse.&lt;br /&gt;- Foams up quite a bit during swishing. I only use a little bit - perhaps a teaspoon or two - and it expands significantly. Don&#x27;t use too much, or you&#x27;ll be overwhelmed!&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a white residue in your mouth, which persists even after attempting to spit vigorously. I wonder if this is due to the hydrogen peroxide, as I experienced a similar issue with another whitening mouthwash I used in the past. It&#x27;s not too bothersome, especially since I usually use this at night, so no one sees that there&#x27;s a bit of white lingering around the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;- In the first several months that I used this, I think the surface layer of cells inside my mouth would slough off. I&#x27;d end up picking these weird, gross, thin, moist membranes from the inside of my cheeks. This has stopped after continuing to use the product and getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all this being said, I&#x27;m really happy to have a product that combines fluoride (I have issues with cavities, no matter how good I try to be with oral hygiene) with whitening action.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping the teeth extra clean adn part of daily regiment.  No cavities and have been using for years, so must be doing something right.  Add this to your daily mix!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 6 months now and it&#x27;s the first mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried in 20 years that works well enough that I&#x27;m consistent bought using it. Yes, it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use - alcohol and active hydrogen peroxide swishing around in your mouth isn&#x27;t going to feel good. But 60 seconds is a small price to pay for an entire day of a very clean mouth and no morning breath. My teeth are already quite white, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is at increasing whiteness, but I do think it&#x27;s helped me avoid new stains (I enjoy cola, red wine, and other staining foods).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried regular Listerine and a few other brands including alcohol-free versions but rarely finished the bottle because they didn&#x27;t seem to have a huge benefit. If you can stand a minute of discomfort, you&#x27;ll have a noticeably clean mouth and fresher breath for the entire day.</li>
    <li> I think it does alot based on advertisement but it tastes like medication...if you don&#x27;t mind it then its a good product!</li>
    <li> It foams up in your mouth, making you feel the need to spit and spit and spit-gross  I realize that it&#x27;s the peroxide action that causes that but it&#x27;s not pleasant, and it creates a bad taste in my mouth.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Left my teeth and mouth feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> i usaly use the cheap cvs or target brand and they work great i tryed this because it was cheap it had a horid taste no flaor and the tast wont go away if it was maybe mint flavored or something and not so strong it might be ok and i will finish it off and not waste it but will not be buying it again</li>
    <li> OVERALL HEALTH OF MOUTH&lt;br /&gt;I rinse with Listerine Total Care Plus Whitening for a full minute after brushing twice a day. I do also floss every night prior to use.  My mouth has never felt cleaner than it does during the day after using this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHITENING&lt;br /&gt;It does appear to be slowly whitening my teeth.  After a month of twice a day usage, my teeth appear to be ever-so-slightly whiter.  I compare my teeth every once in a while to a porcelain crown I have, a fake tooth which won&#x27;t discolor or change shades of white at all.  This product doesn&#x27;t whiten fast, but little by little you can see it working. It&#x27;s surely not going to whiten as fast as specialized strips/gels, but at least this stuff doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like those products would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TASTE&lt;br /&gt;This stuff doesn&#x27;t taste good.  It is intense.  The regular purple bottle without whitening is much more tolerable.  What do you expect in a mouthwash plus whitening product?  It contains alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and phosphoric acid.  Do people think it&#x27;s going to be like rinsing with Hershey&#x27;s syrup or something?  At first it was pretty hard to swish for a full minute, but after a week or two I seemed to develop a tolerance for it, and it&#x27;s not bad at all now.  At first it felt like it was burning my tongue and gums a lot worse than it does now, and I now don&#x27;t seem to notice the funky peroxide taste as much.  Man up and deal with it if you want a healthier mouth, or go buy that Scope crap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of mouthwashes and some are more effective than others. After using this product for a few months (and flossing, of course) my dentist said my gum line looks a lot better than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an intense mouthwash, so moving it around for the recommended period can be a challenge. That, however, is one of the reasons it is so effective. The wash remains around the gum line of teeth, killing bacteria and helping to fight against cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; effectiveness is limited to how long the product stays on your teeth before you eat/drink something. So the longer you go after rinsing without do either the more effective it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t handle the intense feeling you get while using this product try the alcohol free &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> I stand burning. I can stand icky. I can stand messy. I can stand sticky. But this mouthwash stings the nerves in my teeth. Imagine Lightning striking inside your tooth every time you rinsed your mouth. I am not sure if its working, or telling me I need to grab pliers and remove the tooth. As someone with FANTASTIC oral hygiene, there is no reason to be sensitive to a product. Alas, I will need to find a new product. I got this as subscribe and save, and went back to check if other people had the same problem. Its out of stock, making the decision to switch even easier.</li>
    <li> I love the peroxide action in this mouthwash. I brush with it after toothpaste, aiming for my gums. The fizzies do it for me.</li>
    <li> The taste is too strong and doesn&#x27;t seem to cleanse as well as needed.  It needs to have a less harsh flavor.</li>
    <li> I like this mouth wash but it is very intense. You better be ready for a burn cause this stuff can be brutal.</li>
    <li> On time.  Intact.  As advertised.  No problems.  A well known retail item of consistent quality.  Not much more to be said.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It keeps my mouth feeling clean, my teeth white, and my breath fresh.  Unfortunately the price has gone waaaay up since my last purchase; now it&#x27;s over twice the local price.</li>
    <li> This is very Good Listerine, It really does feel like it kills alot of germs, and after a couple of weeks my teeth has gotten whiter.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty strong, which I like, because that tells me it&#x27;s working.  However, my inner sides of cheek and gums always peel after use.  It was only after I finished the entire bottle and completely stopped using the product, my problem went away.  Not sure if others will experience the same thing, but this is not for me.</li>
    <li> Disgusting. Cannot use. Tastes more like old chemicals than fresh mint. I thought this was similar to a kind I had tried, but it&#x27;s not. If you aren&#x27;t sure you&#x27;ve tried this one, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-teeth feel extremely clean after use&lt;br /&gt;-noticeably whiter teeth after about a week of recommended use&lt;br /&gt;-large bottle&lt;br /&gt;-for the horrible taste when using you will notice that your breath stays fresh for a long time after use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;-taste&lt;br /&gt;-mouth burns and goes numb&lt;br /&gt;-you can not eat or drink until about a half hour after use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouth wash is not for the weak hearted it has strict directions that you need to follow and a user age limit.  Your mouth will go numb and burn when you use it, and it does take a while to get use to but the results are phenomenal.  Honestly best mouth wash I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pair this mouth rinse with [[ASIN:B001QY9QEA Colgate Total Advanced Clean Toothpaste 5.8 oz]]</li>
    <li> Let me just tell you that the whole terrible taste controversy is true. It&#x27;s awful. It&#x27;s not bad enough to make you have a gag reflex but it&#x27;s certainly not &amp;#34;Fresh Mint&amp;#34;. Other people also stated that it was painful but I didnt think so, it wasnt that bad. Other than that my mouth does feel refreshed and my breath is actually a little minty from what I can tell from the cupping-the-hands-over-the-mouth technique. If you can find something better then get it. I dont want to put these 32 ounces to waste so ill just have to pinch my nose and deal with the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the thing mightve been damaged but when I opened up my amazon package the liquid was spilled all over the box and made everything sticky. The screw on the top may just be badly designed.</li>
    <li> I did not like this stuff at all. I am not really bothered by burning. This stuff burns like it&#x27;s main active ingredient is battery acid but I&#x27;m pretty ok with that. The problem is that when I use it it makes everything taste wrong. I don&#x27;t mean for 15-30 minutes after I use it like most mouthwashes, I mean all day. Everything just tasted wrong, even plain water! It took two days after I stopped using it for my taste buds to go back to normal. I will be switching back to another mouthwash. Everyone is different so I&#x27;m not going to tell you not to buy this, but I strongly suggest that you try a smaller bottle to get a feel for how it will effect you.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t take the taste I threw it out I don&#x27;t care if it makes gold shoot out of my mouth I can&#x27;t stress how horrible it taste!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! My dentist recommended me to by a mouth wash specially because I had a sensitive tooth. After using it my tooth got EVEN MORE SENSITIVE! grrrr I quickly changed my the type of mouth wash, the simpler the better... when it whitens and desensitize and blablab... be careful</li>
    <li> To each their won, but the after taste of this product had me wanting another mouthwash.  The &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; formula has a peroxide after-tatse. I do use and like Listerine products in general, but not this one.</li>
    <li> It did leave my mouth smelling fresh and I have no doubt it&#x27;s likely good for your mouth and teeth, but burns too much for me to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Love this Listerine mouthwash. Does not taste great but that is obviously not the point. Only mouthwash I ever use!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using Listerine for years, so I didn&#x27;t expect a great-tasting mouthwash. But this stuff tasted so bad that I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t doubt that the product does what it claims to do, but I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mouth wash. Extremely effective for combating bad breath when used properly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Burns so good, get used to it. 6 benefits plus whitening! My mouth is completely clean after using it. Kills the worst morning breath.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the Listerine Total Care line for a few years now.  I&#x27;ve gone between the mint and cinnamon flavors, depending on availability and price.  Granted--they both feel like battery acid, but I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new bottle and Amazon&#x27;s price on the Total Care Plus Whitening was better than on the other flavors.  So I&#x27;m using that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is odd.  I use an Arm and Hammer Baking Soda toothpaste and the combination of that and this mouthwash results in a mouthful of foam.  I can actually feel the mouthwash popping as it expands.  It&#x27;s good for about 15 seconds before I have to spit it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not feeling I&#x27;m getting the full effect of the product this way, I tried using the mouthwash first.  The resulting flavor in my mouth reminded me of the smell of a room freshly sprayed with insecticide.  Seriously--this is no exaggeration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably tough out the rest of the bottle...but, while I recommend the Total Care line in general, stay clear of this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Just DUMPED IT down the drain.  I could&#x27;t take it anymore.  I have gone back to the old regular Total Care.</li>
    <li> Leaves a great sensation and smell. It&#x27;s really good value and lasts. It is also not found in stores so you can only find it online. I&#x27;m not sure why that is but its label says it is better than the ones you can find.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash. This one comes with a whitening ingredients. Other grocery store are selling this kind of product without the whitening ingredients. So its better to buy this one because its all in one. It was able maintained my teeth whitened. Been using it for couple of months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Listerine Total Care for more than a year.  Yes, it burned the first time but I quickly became tolerant of it.  I just learned not to gargle with it because it felt like it literally took a layer off the lining of my throat.  After brushing my teeth, I held it in my mouth a full minute, as the directions suggest. I loved the \\&quot;Just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist\\&quot; feeling it gave me. I have extensive/expensive crowns on my lower teeth and these are built on metal framework. I&#x27;ve noticed recently that the metal parts are now black and I have a metal taste in my mouth all the time.  I have to get this checked out.</li>
    <li> Five stars! This is what I&#x27;ve always wanted in a mouthwash. Burning, foamy, stringy, strong and best of all, it works. I do suffer the foamy mouth, but I don&#x27;t care. I have that burning sensation when I use it, awesome! After I use it my teeth feel like I just had a cleaning. My mouth is fresh and I can tell my teeth are clean. This is definitely not for everyone, but if you can, give it a try.</li>
    <li> Golly gee whillikers, Batman, how can a mouthwash get so many positive reviews that sound just like TV commercials?  Mouthwash?  Come on.  Where do I sign up to get paid to write crap like this?  This stuff has artificial sweeteners in it, which are somewhat poisonous.  I&#x27;d sooner swill antifreeze in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I want you guys to know that I’ve tried a bunch of different whitening products and have come to the realization that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for getting your teeth white. This Listerine product is strong, stronger than anything else they make (It has over 21% alcohol content and hydrogen peroxide!) These agents are what causes people to hate this product (you’ll see a lot of 1 stars on this product) but also the reason why it will make your mouth free of germs and whitened! You must know that going in, you’re not going to get white teeth without these types of ingredients. That said, this product won’t whiten your teeth like a professional teeth whitening kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using [[ASIN:B00HJDIAGC This Whitening Kit]] in combination with Listerine to really get my lustrous shine you’ll see all the news agents flash when they smile at the camera. The reason why a whitening kit like the one I linked work better is simply because the amount of time it’s in your mouth. Listerine is in your mouth for a max 30 seconds to 1 minute (if you’re brave). You’re not going to see major whitening results form this unless you use it daily for 6 months. If you need a fast turn-around time on getting whiter teeth then you need to use Listerine AND a whitening solution. I chose the gel solution as opposed to the strips because they come with heat-molded trays that fit your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product, if not a bit controversial like some of the other reviewers have mentioned. It comes with a powerful punch, and not many people can handle it. If you’re looking to maximize your teeth-whitening potential I’d try to is conjunction with the gel product, OR if you’re a little weary about it, you should try a lower-strength Listerine along-side a true teeth whitening product. This Listerine is great, but not for the weak or weak-minded.</li>
    <li> I purchase this regularly from the local grocery store. Works great. Stronger than other Listerine products, but I generally have no trouble with mouthwash so this does not effect me much. Not sure about the whitening effect as I have not really paid attention to it too much. I love the product though because it gives me a nice clean feeling through the day. It does numb my mouth a bit for 10-15 minutes, but if you follow the no eating or drinking for 30 minutes instructions they provide, that should not be a problem. I did try having a coffee right after using this once and the coffee tasted really bad, so not eating or drinking immediately after use is probably a wise idea. I tend to use this on weekends and Listerine ultra clean on weekdays so I can drink my morning coffee in the car on the way to work.</li>
    <li> Hope it works, because the burn.. is very serious. I find myself being afraid to use it, desperate to rinse with water after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 2 years, daily.  My dentist swears by it and I do also.  Feel it kill those mouth germs, ragh!</li>
    <li> Great product, doesnt make you cry like other listerine, makes teeth whiter and strong, plus everything else it does, amazing.</li>
    <li> I really dont like the taste of this product. I know it&#x27;s a new product but not for me will stick to origanal product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was the alcohol free kind I use but was wrong. It burns I hate it. It belongs to my boyfriend now. He doesn&#x27;t use mouthwash daily so far no feed back.</li>
    <li> New formula has a terrible taste - product innovation gone bad!  Will be returning and switching brands if the original is no longer available.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for about three months now, over time i can tell my teeth is looking healthier than before. At first I remembered this mouthwash being extremely strong, a lot stronger than listerine original that I use before even though the alcohol per part is roughly the same. So strong in fact that I had to stop intermittently every couple of seconds to hold myself against the sink and to tell myself to \\&quot;man up!\\&quot;. I&#x27;m pretty sure my mouth wasn&#x27;t burning so much because of the alcohol, maybe it is because of something else, something extra perhaps...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, for me it&#x27;s the hydrogen peroxide that was bothering me at the beginning, but not anymore. I had never used any whitening products before. As far as I know this ingredient may cause irritation at first, but it is not harmful and many people&#x27;s gums and teeth will get used to it. Through time my gums are accustomed to this whitening ingredient so now it feels like a regular listerine mouthwash, comparatively speaking. I love this mouthwash now and just ordered another one. Like using other listerine mouthwashes, the clean feeling lasts overnight, and I can still make the signature clean squeaky sound with my molars the next morning before I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: If you know you are highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, don&#x27;t get this mouthwash, if you are new to any whitening products, try this one first before you get the expensive strips to see if you are too sensitive to this ingredient. Chances are all consumer whitening products use this ingredient to safely bleach your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI 2.0: For mouthwashing vets, unlike antiseptic kinds, this mouthwash rinses half the amount but twice the time. Not to diss on people, but from the reviews I also suspect the  excess irritation may be because of rinsing with too much of the good stuff. Please DO get a measuring cup and only rinse with 10ml for a full minute as directed, not a capful. 10 ml is not even a half of the cap ( the full cap of this mouthwash bottle is actually around 70ml! ). A 32 oz pack (94 times ish) is supposed to last about a month and a half if you rinse twice a day. For me is about three months. Hope this info helps ya.p ( the full cap of this mouthwash bottle is actually around 70ml! ). A 32 oz pack (94 times ish) is supposed to last about a month and a half if you rinse twice a day.

    <li> Holy moly, this is a mouth full of something active.  It makes the inside of my cheeks burn, as well as the tip of my tongue, and I&#x27;ve got no scratches or abrasions as far as I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there&#x27;s the foaming.  Which is to be expected really.  I knew this mouthwash had hydrogen peroxide and I&#x27;m just glad that it doesn&#x27;t leave me foaming like a rabid dog.  No, instead it froths where I didn&#x27;t brush good enough.  The back of my tongue is apparently a nasty place.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a mouthwash user by the way.  But all of a sudden I started having problems cold and heat sensitivity and I began a search for a mouthwash with some Fluoride to supplement my toothpaste.  When I saw that this wash had just about everything in addition to Fluoride --whitening and antibacterial action-- I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lets not forget the lack of propylene glycol.  It might be a &#x27;food additive&#x27; to the FDA and big industry, but anything that can kill my cat, isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m intentionally going to seek out and consume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS SO FAR&lt;br /&gt;--Honestly I think my teeth are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;--My breath is fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I&#x27;ll have to wait to see if tooth sensitivity is effected.  I will report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT for children (high level of alcohol) or those who have super sensitive mouths.  For the time being, I would suggest this product for those with gingivitis --they&#x27;ll benefit from the hydrogen peroxide-- and the need for fresher breath.</li>
    <li> I really love Listerine products (I have mouthwash and toothpaste). I tried this product twice, and just can&#x27;t get over the cotton texture left in my mouth after using it. It tastes exactly like crest whitestrips if you have ever bought those.</li>
    <li> I look at these reviews to find out if the person/store selling the item is reputable. Or find out if the product does what it is supposed to. Or find recalls or anything helpful to my purchase. Why would you rate this so low just because you didn&#x27;t like the taste? It throws other shoppers off and causes negative effects. Please people. Think before you rant. Not believing all the negatives i had to read comments - good thing i did. It does taste awful. But it works. Now I wonder how much money the guy/store that is selling it lost.</li>
    <li> If it was possible to give ZERO stars I would. I don&#x27;t usually write negative reviews, but this stuff leaves a vile taste in your mouth that you cannot easily spit out. At least with the original Listerine you can spit it out and the taste goes away within a minute or two. With this stuff it seems to leave a coating on your teeth that stays with you for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise going with another flavor---any other flavor but this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to people who think the reviewers who hate this product are just whinning about a simple bad taste, I am updating this review with a more descriptive view of what this product is really like...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff doesn&#x27;t just taste bad---you have to expect that all mouthwashes taste bad. This stuff leaves a terrible after taste that doesn&#x27;t just stay in your mouth for a few minutes, it coast your entire tongue and stays with you for quite some time. I wanted to peel the top layer of my tongue off. I could only compare the after-effect of this product to licking a thick paint or adhesive, except I have never had the displeasure of doing either of those things---I only had the displeasure of using this terrible Listerine product. I could not get that terrible film off my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of regular use I went back to a regular formula Listerine. I would rather burn my tongue off than paint my tongue with this terrible stuff.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash works great and you can really feel it working. It&#x27;s not like most of Listerne&#x27;s brands in that you only have to keep it in your mouth for 30 seconds, but instead a whole minutes (60 seconds). At first it&#x27;s pretty hard to do, but once you get used to it, if you do it twice a day, you can easily get through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking it once in the morning and once at night, I can really feel my bad morning breath has gone away in the past 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t think any product will ever be able to completely get rid of it, but the less the better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this mouth wash.</li>
    <li> I like listerine and use it twice a day to make brushing easier. I like how it loosens debris in between my teeth. This version of listerine is slightly more money and is slightly worse at loosening the debris and it leaves a kind of uncomfortable film on your teeth. I expect this is intended to be a teeth protector but I find myself needing to brush after it to feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this mouthwash and it has made a tremendous difference. I am extremely determined to keep all my teeth for the remainder of my life. I&#x27;ve been using for it for over a year. I use after I brush in the morning (post coffee) and after I floss every night before bed. My teeth are significantly whiter, my breath is much improved (all day), and my dentist says my gums are in &amp;#34;astoundingly good condition&amp;#34; for a 53 year old. My time with the dental hygienist is cut in half because I don&#x27;t have the staining or plaque buildup anymore. I highly recommend this mouthwash. You do get used to it if you stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a couple weeks for a noticeable difference in whiteness. I believe the whitening action in this mouthwash is among the safest and most reasonably priced available. A few of my friends have their teeth professionally whitened or use strips and I think my teeth are every bit as bright as theirs.  And what&#x27;s better is that my whiteness looks more natural. In other words, my teeth don&#x27;t glow in the dark.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a bottle of this and it doesn&#x27;t leave a terrible taste in the mouth at all. However, I&#x27;m not sure how much I noticed whitening effects.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It burns, and I mean burns BAD (at first; I get used to it after consistent use for like a week..).  But it really leaves my teeth feeling clean and look noticeably whiter! Not like the &amp;#34;I obviously get my teeth professionally whitened on a regular basis&amp;#34; white, but a NATURAL white.  (I&#x27;ve also been warned by my dentist that whitening strips only work on what they touch, so in between and behind the teeth don&#x27;t get whitened at all. Mouthwash gets everywhere.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t taste the best.  I like the original blue flavor of listerine a lot better, but I still feel and know my breath is just fine. And the taste doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently my husband&#x27;s dentist said this was not great for teeth because it has acid in it.. (This is why the 4-star rating.)  So after hearing that, I decided to split the use between this and a heavy fluoride rinse, either by doing one in the morning, the other at night, or switching every other day.  This way I&#x27;m not spending money to use twice as much rinse. I just extend the life of each.</li>
    <li> I have used Listerine my whole life and I prefer it by far to other brands. However, this version tastes like something that belongs in a car engine. I would warn anyone considering it to stay away. My mistake should be your guide here.</li>
    <li> This has hydrogen peroxide in it and tastes like it;could still taste it all next day.  Had to pour it down the sink.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviewsof people saying it burnsi was very skeptical. I have extremely sensitive gums. The burn isn&#x27;t any more severe than regular Listerine. Unlike the Listerine pre brush whitening rinse the stuff actually does whiten teeth noticeably. If you are someone that has to use mouthwash this is for you. It&#x27;s all in one product. I will warn you the foaming that others mentioned is true. I have gotten used to it. It&#x27;s not that big a deal.</li>
    <li> Good clean feeling. The foaming action makes me think it&#x27;s getting into all the nooks and crannies. Slight burn for sure.</li>
    <li> First, I love it because it is NOT a pre-rinse. I can brush, floss, and then rinse with it. Second, I love it because it works. I started using this about two months ago, and my teeth were visibly whiter after the first week of use. Third, I love the great clean Listerine feeling that comes with it. My mouth still feels just as fresh and clean as it did when I used the regular Listerine. I know some were complaining about the taste but I have no problems with the fresh mint flavor. I love that I got from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find this in my local grocery store.</li>
    <li> My last order of this product in the 32 ounce size was priced at $6.97 per bottle.  A bit lower than what I can get in the local drug store...in other words, your standard good Amazon deal.  I bought 3 bottles for slightly over $20.  I finished the last order and just came back the same Amazon web address for the product to reorder.  To my amazement the price for one 32 ounce bottle is now $15.21!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t know better, I would think this was an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Guess I get my mouthwash at the drug store.</li>
    <li> This product is not only antiseptic, but also whitening and contains floride to strengthen enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain alcohol, so it can burn, but I&#x27;ve found it leave my mouth feeling much cleaning than non-alcohol based mouthwashes. I&#x27;ve found the burn is minimized by actually measuring out 2 tablespoons instead of guestimating based on the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone seeking a mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I use Listerine regular mouthwash religiously, but decided to try this as I am now experiencing weak enamel (runs in the family). I read the safety warning re: irritation before I used it, and boy are they not kidding! The burning on my gums and tongue was really hard to take, and the irritation didn&#x27;t go away when I spat it out. I don&#x27;t care that it tastes bad (it does) so long as it works, but there&#x27;s just no way that irritated gums and mouth is good for oral health. Off to find another wash that helps with enamel... Gave it two stars because I think the product itself can be beneficial, *if* your mouth can take it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this great product for some time now, so when I saw it was available on subscribe and save, I immediately ordered.</li>
    <li> After 1 week of use it gave me swollen and bleeding gums, no taste buds, and my cheek walls to the roof of my mouth feel blistered or swollen.  A week before when I was not using this mouthwash I had a perfectly healthy mouth.  I am currently in recovery and wish we never used this garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, there a number of other reports of issues with this mouthwash.  Take them as you will:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ehealthme.com/sa/3894826/gingival+bleeding&lt;br /&gt;http://patientsville.com/medication/listerine_side_effects.htm&lt;br /&gt;http://www.adverseevents.com/drugdetail.php?AEDrugID&#x3D;6015&amp;BrandName&#x3D;Listerine+Whitening</li>
    <li> This stuff actually caused me to lose my tastebuds.  It left a weird chemical taste in my mouth for hours after using it.  Food didn&#x27;t taste the same.  I used several bottles as well.  It caused swelling  and little erruptions on my tongue.  This stuff is really nasty and full of harmful chemicals.  Stick with Listerine Naturals with fluoride if you want something affective and natural.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I know Listerine has a strong bite no matter what kind you choose, but this total care tastes terrible!  No one in my home will even use it!</li>
    <li> This is like the last kind I bought except this one has the added whitening formula. It does what you expect Listerine to do, but it is very potent. It very strong. It almost burns my mouth. I can not gargle with it for more than 10 or 15 seconds. Even after I spit it out, the sensation lingers for minutes. I guess it must be killing germs that&#x27;s why I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It works fine as a mouthwash. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because I don&#x27;t know what a mouthwash would do to rate that.  It does have all of the features I wanted, which some do not.</li>
    <li> I like my Listerine, but this one has whitening stuff in it. After a few seconds in your mouth it gets foamy and keeps  on foaming for a bit. Hard to get all out of mouth.  Regular Listerine for me.</li>
    <li> Great price for a household staple delivered right to your doorstep .</li>
    <li> I love that this mouthwash has a lousy taste; that all translates to doing its job, and very well for that matter. There are 6 things that this product claims to do, and they&#x27;re all accurate. The thing that stands out to me is the strengthening of my teeth. My teeth and gums feel in alignment and the whitening is a bonus. This product is a tad pricey, but it pays dividends in the form of better oral health. And yes, this wash can sometimes \\&quot;burn\\&quot; a little, though that word is a great exaggeration. The taste isn&#x27;t great as I alluded to, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a product that simply does its job. One wouldn&#x27;t want to nullify potency by adding some fancy flavoring; there are other mouthwashes out there that taste great but are inferior in performance. I recommend this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Nice mouthwash, but the &amp;#34;Total Care&amp;#34; variation did not provide whitening like the white-bottle Listerine. We&#x27;d recommend you choose that one instead.</li>
    <li> I used to use the white bottle whitening Listerine and thought I would give this a try... it&#x27;s different.  It&#x27;s got much more of a burn to it, although definitely lets you know it&#x27;s killing the germs.  My mouth feels so amazing afterwards though.</li>
    <li> Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I like that the the wash targets protecting/restoring enamel, which is one of its more unique features. However, it is very strong/tends to burn my mouth. Recently, I have purchased Listerine&#x27;s alcohol free version of the same wash and I think that it is the 5-star version of this product.</li>
    <li> So about this product, i am unsure why so many people griped about it.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, whitens your teeth, and gives u good breathe.&lt;br /&gt;*It does burn a bit more than usual mouthwash, but nothing you shouldnt be able to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, AFTER ABOUT 2 WEEKS OF USING, I HAVE NOTICED BLACK HAIRY TONGUE developing on the back of my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use this stuff again, and now am getting a tongue cleaner to hopefully prevent the black hair to spreading up to anywhere where people may see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very good dental hygiene, and am %100 certain it was caused from this product.&lt;br /&gt;(any mouthwash can disrupt the balance of yeast tho in your mouth and cause it).</li>
    <li> This has an absolutely HORRIBLE aftertaste!! I definitely wish I would have purchased a different kind of Listerine! I highly recommend purchasing a different product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with the burn. Quite like the way it cleans my mouth - foams up a bit and feels fresh and refreshed. My teeth are clean, white and healthy. This has gotta help.</li>
    <li> I have used various Listerine formulas for years. This stuff has a weird consistency, weird flavor; but the worst is that it turns into slimy foam once it hits your mouth, then you can&#x27;t spit it all OUT. Yech. On the up side, it seems to keep tartar well-controlled throughout the day - but I&#x27;m getting so grossed-out by it that I probably won&#x27;t be able to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Fresh mint Listerin Total Care Plus for years. This version came in different packaging than I&#x27;m used to and tasted significantly different, and significantly worse. I did not like the taste it left in my mouth, when normally for this I do. I noted it was clear liquid instead of the purple looking liquid that I&#x27;m used to. This change is not for me. I threw it away and went to the store to find the version I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> Disgusting! I don&#x27;t mind the old listerine taste; i&#x27; used to that. But this stuff was slimy and when I spit it out it foamed. It was had to get all out of my mouth, I had to rinse with a glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottle and poured them down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;And order Act which I have been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;Bad mistake. Never again</li>
    <li> When I received the bottle I could instantly tell it was open on the inside without even opening the package. I could smell it. Opened it up and there was a huge dent in the bottom which had punctured a whole in it it causing it to leak in the little bag.</li>
