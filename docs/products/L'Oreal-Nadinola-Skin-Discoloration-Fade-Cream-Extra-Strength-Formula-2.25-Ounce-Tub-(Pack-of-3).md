      <li>You can read more about it here: http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm203112.htm</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and get brown spots on my cheeks and the back of my hands.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products to fade the spots on my 64 year old face - this has worked the best of anything I&#x27;ve purchased over the years -was ready to make a dermatologist appt</li>
      <li>and I am getting great results so far</li>
      <li>Im a chocolate brown complexion and scar easily.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the fast results of the product.</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s doing fine with it as well.  </li>
      <li>It take some time but with incredie results it has a good smel and really works you can tell how it worked even if you have a mild melasma like me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important not to use it during the day.</li>
      <li>I used this product for a month and absolutely nothing changed!!!</li>
      <li>I suggest you try it you will not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it! :-)</li>
      <li>It is NOT meant for full face or body lightener.</li>
      <li>Not bad but noticeable to me.  </li>
      <li>and it makes my skin SUPER OILY</li>
      <li>This product worked exactly as promised!</li>
      <li>* Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success...</li>
      <li>Kina Meh, i works good enough I suppose, but it isnt a miracle, if you use too much it may break u out</li>
      <li>It smells funny, but I have seen quick results.</li>
      <li>The product did a good job in fading spots due to melisma, it didn&#x27;t have any odor either.</li>
      <li>i am a fair skined Black women.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, there is some concern about hydroquinone being a carcinogen, although the FDA has found hydroquinone in the 1.5 to 2% range safe, and this, containing 3%, is right above that.</li>
      <li>this however did exactly what it said it would.</li>
      <li>I consistently get this prodct from amazon.  </li>
      <li>Certain try it first for the price.  </li>
      <li>but I do admit I was swayed into trying this because of the relatively positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT, I USED IT EVERY NITE AFTER CLEANSING, APPLY SMALL AMOUNT...</li>
      <li>But I tried this since I&#x27;m having many dark spots in my face for being always under direct sun light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m half way though the second jar and those areas have lighted greatly.</li>
      <li>My dark areas are lighter and i&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be much lighter if i would have bought another bottle right away.</li>
      <li>It works and is reasonably priced .</li>
      <li>Rec&#x27;d the product very timely manner.  </li>
      <li>i do believe that results very based on your skin tone and your expectations.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was using a very exspensive fade cream that I would rate a 3 compared to Extra-strength hydroquinone.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know much about them.</li>
      <li>I did not use the product over my whole face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really upset because I was putting poison in my body for nothing.</li>
      <li>The vendor was very speedy with the shipment.</li>
      <li>Really ?????  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for a while now and am very satisifed with the results.  </li>
      <li>My mother had large and dark brown spots dermatologist were un able to help.</li>
      <li>This bleach smells like cold cream which is very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>My skin likes to vacillate between combination and sensitive and the first night I used this</li>
      <li>Most over-the-counter products only have 2% hydroquinone (skin lightening agent) and that really isn&#x27;t enough for me.</li>
      <li>so far nothing much is happening still waiting i&#x27;m using it on my leg</li>
      <li>my face is brand new.</li>
      <li>Overall, I will recommend using it with retin-A to see better results and wear a big hat and big glasses even when driving protect your skin.</li>
      <li>and it got rid of it completely!  </li>
      <li>The key is to be consistent and to use sunscreen whenever you are gonna be out in the sun.</li>
      <li>Use only pea size amount for whole face.  </li>
      <li>But i definitely would buy this product again because it really did make a difference.</li>
      <li>My husband has extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>Listen DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
      <li>However, my skin is sensitive and it caused my acne to flair up</li>
      <li>Make sure you only put it exactly on the spots you want to fade or you will have a few slightly lighter spots on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Most dark spots are gone and just a few dots are left.</li>
      <li>During the first week the spots began to lighten and I noticed a little redness in and around the spots.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to do the same for more than double and very little</li>
      <li>I had some hormone related darkening on my cheeks and around my mouth that made me look like I had a goatee (not exactly what any woman wants), but after two weeks of use, the darkening had all but disappeared.</li>
      <li>I started using this a few weeks ago and even the first night i used it, I woke up the next morning with lighter spots already.  </li>
      <li>Wow if you lighter skin you may not want to use this product it tured my marks a purplish blue hue very strange would not recommend for fairer complexions</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was less than half the price of more expensive fade creams with hydroquinone in them and it works as well. The only down side is that it smells a little like your Grandma&#x27;s face cream.  Not bad but noticeable to me.  My husband has extremely sensitive skin and he&#x27;s doing fine with it as well.  Would recommend over more pricey products.  Certain try it first for the price.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I consistently get this prodct from amazon.  It comes on time, and it effective.[[ASIN:B001F0QXPU L&#x27;Oreal Nadinola Skin Discoloration Fade Cream, Extra Strength Formula, 2.25-Ounce Tub (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT, I USED IT EVERY NITE AFTER CLEANSING, APPLY SMALL AMOUNT...ALWAYS USE YOUR SUN-SCREEN..NOT TO BE USED FOR MORE THAN 3 MONTHS...TAKE A BREAK FOR COUPLE OF WKS. IT DOES WORK</li>
    <li> Im a chocolate brown complexion and scar easily. I had acne marks left over and left dark spots on my CHEEKS and forehead. Ive watched NUMEROUS youtube videos claiming it worked and my mom said it worked for her HOWEVER it does NO JUSTICE for me. I ve been using this product for a MONTH and have seen NO justice and it makes my skin SUPER OILY</li>
    <li> This product works well at reducing freckles and darker spots on the skin. I will buy it again if needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slow in working but has made a big difference after using daily over the past 4 month. I&#x27;m continuing with home to make the scars and marks totally disapear. A jar lasts a long time and strongest stuff I could find without a prescription</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d the product very timely manner.  Haven&#x27;t been using long enough to tell if it works.  Very rich and creamy!  Little goes long way.  Use only pea size amount for whole face.  Smells good,</li>
    <li> I have been ordering skin bleach from Canada for years.  (4%)  This seems to work just as well at (3%) and has sunscreen and a nice smelling base.  The prescription bleach had a horrible smell.  This bleach smells like cold cream which is very pleasant.  It is keeping the spots at bay.</li>
    <li> My mother had large and dark brown spots dermatologist were un able to help. She tried everything. After using this cream you can&#x27;t see the brown spots.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products to fade the spots on my 64 year old face - this has worked the best of anything I&#x27;ve purchased over the years -was ready to make a dermatologist appt but now I don&#x27;t have to.  Fast shipping, excellent service.</li>
    <li> I started using this a few weeks ago and even the first night i used it, I woke up the next morning with lighter spots already.  I use it twice a day everyday before I go to bed and before I go to work.  Make sure you only put it exactly on the spots you want to fade or you will have a few slightly lighter spots on your skin.  I use a Q-tip and try to put it only on the spot to avoid other discoloration.  It leaves you a little oily but that is such a small sacrifice for evenly toned skin.  I love it and will continue to use it.  Most dark spots are gone and just a few dots are left.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product since other products with similar claims didn&#x27;t live up to the hype *cough* Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success...this however did exactly what it said it would. I had some hormone related darkening on my cheeks and around my mouth that made me look like I had a goatee (not exactly what any woman wants), but after two weeks of use, the darkening had all but disappeared. There was some lightening of the surrounding skin that I didn&#x27;t care for, but that went away a couple of days after I stopped using the cream and the darkening never returned. All in all a good buy.</li>
    <li> Used this everyday (sometimes twice a day) on my knees, elbows and eye area to deal with hyperpigmentation. I&#x27;m half way though the second jar and those areas have lighted greatly. The key is to be consistent and to use sunscreen whenever you are gonna be out in the sun. I try to use at least SPF 30 or higher.</li>
    <li> I hate writing reviews on any beauty product because it&#x27;s so subjective but I do admit I was swayed into trying this because of the relatively positive reviews.  This would be 2.5 stars if Amazon could allow such a rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It smells weird.  If you&#x27;re put off by facial products that have a very specific scent do not order this.  It&#x27;s a cross between garlic and burnt rubber.  Very, very weird.  You get used to it after awhile but I am not a fan of any strange scent so this was a big negative for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You may want to ease into using this on a daily basis.  My skin likes to vacillate between combination and sensitive and the first night I used this my cheeks flared up the next day.  I found that using a cream cleanser (regular ol&#x27; cold cream) and then applying a thin layer at night for the first week help acclimate the skin.  Long example short - this is a step away from prescription grade, be prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It is no overnight miracle.  It&#x27;s not even a month-in miracle.  For me it has not erased any dark spots.  It has not lightened any dark spots.  What it has done is soften my skin and even out the non-affected areas of my complexion. I&#x27;m almost 2 months into using it so I&#x27;m getting close to the deadline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product recommends you stop using it if no (positive) change is seen within 3 months of using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fade cream for a few years. I only use it at night. It&#x27;s important not to use it during the day. If you put it on your skin and go out into the sun your dark spots get darker. I have very fair skin and get brown spots on my cheeks and the back of my hands. Using this every night at bedtime keeps the spots at bay. But you must use it every night for those results.</li>
    <li> I used this product religiously for 8 weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any changes on my dark spots.....very disappointing.  Also, I didn&#x27;t realized that I was purchasing a pack of three tubs of the product.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product to remove my dark spot from acne but i am amazed. two weeks if using it . i love it my face is brand new. i recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is a very good product to be under the counter and contains 3% hydroquinone. It take about a month to see results, but is a temporary fix because as soon as you expose your face to the sun even with sun block on, the dark spots will return and darker than before. Overall, I will recommend using it with retin-A to see better results and wear a big hat and big glasses even when driving protect your skin. The Obagi cost about $40 just has 4% hydroquinone and provides with the same results. Walmart has the nadinola for less than $7. If it does not work, see a dermatologist to get prescription for a customized treatment.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the fast results of the product. I could see some improvements after a week of using the product. The vendor was very speedy with the shipment. I would recommend using the product and would search to order it from the same vendor.</li>
    <li> It does not work for me, I did not see any results. I have just stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;dont buy</li>
    <li> This face cream fades spots and is also a great moisturizer . It was actually recommended to me by a dermatologist. It works and is reasonably priced . I can&#x27;t do without it. Awesome product !</li>
    <li> I really liked this cream. it has a nice texture however the smell is semi garlic like. But it goes away within five mins or so. i used this cream in the morning and night for my elbows, knees and underarms. i noticed that it began to fade my dark areas after 2 months of daily use. Yeah! i know, it took quite a while to work. And it did not permanently fade my dark areas because i didn&#x27;t continue to use it after i ran out of one bottle. But i definitely would buy this product again because it really did make a difference. My dark areas are lighter and i&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be much lighter if i would have bought another bottle right away. Thank you Nadinola!</li>
    <li> This is an extra-strength hydroquinone cream, with 3% hydroquinone.  All others I&#x27;ve found OTC are 2% and Rx is 4%, so this stuff definitely works.  I used it for melasma as well as some sunspots and scars and with regular use (Good strong sunscreen is a MUST!)it does the job within about 4 weeks.  I went without enough sunscreen for 3 days in Mexico, and the brown spots came back worse than ever.  So, Nadinola ES, sunscreen and if you have a Rx, Tretinoin (Retin-A), and you will have gorgeous skin within 2 months.   No bull.</li>
    <li> Kina Meh, i works good enough I suppose, but it isnt a miracle, if you use too much it may break u out then you have to take a break on it for a few days</li>
    <li> I had this product less than a day, used it over night and now have red sections on my face where I placed the cream. Terrible. I&#x27;m hoping that it will just fade away, the redness. Did nothing for the sun spots I had already. Returning this item.</li>
    <li> No Joke! this is the best fade cream on the market. I was using a very exspensive fade cream that I would rate a 3 compared to Extra-strength hydroquinone. I saw a difference in 4 days. I only use it at night before bed time. My face has cleared up in such an Awesome way. I only paid $5.99 for my bottle at Wal-mart.I suggest you try it you will not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skin person who used this product for a more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product obsessively for a week and a half on dark areas of my skin, like elbows knees and some spots here and there.&lt;br /&gt;i use a generous amount every day after taking a shower. it smells like old lady cream( i hate this smell) and nothing has changed in making my skin even or lighter...&lt;br /&gt;the only reason it isn&#x27;t one star is because it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and it comes with a lot of cream for a very small price tag. I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to do the same for more than double and very little product.&lt;br /&gt;and i do believe that results very based on your skin tone and your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;overall i don&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use if for skin discoloration on my underarms. It smells funny, but I have seen quick results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of skin creams so I don&#x27;t know much about them. But I tried this since I&#x27;m having many dark spots in my face for being always under direct sun light. I just started using this 5 days ago and believe it or not I already start seeing great results. I think this thing does what it says, I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while now and am very satisifed with the results.  I spent alot of time in the sun and my face had sun spots along with dark spots from acne break outs.  Over time this product has faded those spots and my skin looks much better</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle worker. Like I said in my headline, I have been using it for less than a week and it&#x27;s already working on my sun damage from when I was a sun worshipper. Most over-the-counter products only have 2% hydroquinone (skin lightening agent) and that really isn&#x27;t enough for me. In order to get 4%, you have to get a prescription. This contains 3%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works so much better than the plant-based, hydroquinone-less nonsense that I paid over $40 for at my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, there is some concern about hydroquinone being a carcinogen, although the FDA has found hydroquinone in the 1.5 to 2% range safe, and this, containing 3%, is right above that.

    <li> I have been using Nadinola for months and I like it alright, but this merchant is advertising that it is a L&#x27;Oreal product ?????  Really ?????  I don&#x27;t see the name L&#x27;Oreal anywhere on the label.</li>
    <li> I use this strictly for &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; on  my face and hands and it works well, though not fast.  It is NOT meant for full face or body lightener. I will buy more of this when I run out.</li>
    <li> oh I love itmy face is very nice and cleanon the spot and my face disappearI give you five star</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month and I am getting great results so far, my skin looks much better.</li>
    <li> It take some time but with incredie results it has a good smel and really works you can tell how it worked even if you have a mild melasma like me ¡</li>
    <li> so i use this for about two weeks on my face because i had a really annoying sun spot on my cheeks and it got rid of it completely!  i was shocked that something over the counter could get rid of it..i was considering chemical peels and everything else but i figured i would give this a try and its a miracle.  now im still using it because i want to lighten up my freckles. i have already gone through one jar...</li>
    <li> The product did a good job in fading spots due to melisma, it didn&#x27;t have any odor either. However, my skin is sensitive and it caused my acne to flair up so I had to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> ok started using this 29/11/12 so far nothing much is happening still waiting i&#x27;m using it on my leg i have a scar from when i was a child that i hate so i&#x27;m hoping this cream finally get rid of it</li>
    <li> This product worked exactly as promised! Majority of my dark spots are almost gone, including the newer and darkest ones. I did not use the product over my whole face. I used it only on my dark spots 2-3 times EVERYDAY (morning, sometimes midday, and before bed at night). During the first week the spots began to lighten and I noticed a little redness in and around the spots. After the first week the redness began to go away and at week two I saw dramatic improvement of the spots. It now has been almost a month and my dark spots are almost completely gone! The product has worked so well and has exceeded any expectations that I had when I purchased it. I highly recommend it! :-)</li>
    <li> Wow. I used this for a week and notice the skin dark marks on my face from pimples fade then a couple of days later it turned purple and blue type color. Mind you i am a fair skined Black women. Wow if you lighter skin you may not want to use this product it tured my marks a purplish blue hue very strange would not recommend for fairer complexions i believe it maybe a bit too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this product a TWO WEEKS or so ago. WILL NEVER USE AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> This shaaat doesn&#x27;t work I used this product for a month and absolutely nothing changed!!! I&#x27;m really upset because I was putting poison in my body for nothing. Listen DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY. I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking.</li>
