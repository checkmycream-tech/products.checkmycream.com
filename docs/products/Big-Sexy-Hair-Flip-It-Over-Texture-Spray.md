<li> Flip it back up and WOW!  </li>
<li> As soon as I curl it with the curling iron, even though i have leyers, it goes flat.</li>
<li> Second, I thought this would be a dry spray</li>
<li> lifted from the weight of her long hair.  </li>
<li> This product stays sticky for a very long time after you spray it.</li>
<li> I received Dry Shampoo instead of Texture Spray.</li>
<li> Just don&#x27;t use it by the roots, and only 3 sprays needed, upside down.</li>
<li> Made my hair greasy and flat, other products do not do this, including other products from this brand.</li>
<li> With thick, naturally wavy hair, I was hoping to find a professional-level hairspray to help hold some of the texture of &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; from the morning.  </li>
<li> But a word of caution only spray a small amount.  </li>
<li> this spray really works wonders on my difficult hair</li>
<li> I flip my head over brush my hair down and spray.  </li>
<li> On the other hand it doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff.</li>
<li> Never leaves me feeling like I have something icky in the hair, but keeps my style going all day long!</li>
<li> I found this hairspray, in all of half a dozen attempts, to leave my hair feeling incredibly stiff immediately and then found it limp less than 20 minutes after application.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s heavy and thick.</li>
<li> I am pretty disappointed.  </li>
<li> I ordered 6 and one of them, although sealed like all the rest, had hardly anything in the can.  </li>
<li> I would definitely not recommend this to a friend :(</li>
<li> Because it&#x27;s semi-oily consistency, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with thin hair.</li>
<li> I try buying this in stores and it is just too expensive.  </li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sad about it</li>

    <li> This gives your hair fullness, without looking like a helmet-head. Just don&#x27;t use it by the roots, and only 3 sprays needed, upside down. Then throw your hair back and style.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but be careful not to use too much or accidentally spray it on top of your hair. It turned mine quite greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle can for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have a lot if hair and it&#x27;s heavy and thick. As soon as I curl it with the curling iron, even though i have leyers, it goes flat. This product works great for me because it gives me volume, gets rid of my flyaways and the curls last longer. Because it&#x27;s semi-oily consistency, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with thin hair.</li>
    <li> Made my hair greasy and flat, other products do not do this, including other products from this brand. Dont buy this. It isnt returnable either, something about shipping hazardous materials.</li>
    <li> I have been usyng this product since my stylist intruduce it, we use it different than a hair sprsy. we spray our hands and rub it thru our hair to finish after its been set. I love it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.the product is big and sexy flip it over.</li>
    <li> This product is way to sticky and it smells like hairspray mixed with pepper ..yuck!!! I wanted to try something cheaper than what I normally get (aquage finishing spray) but this is the bottom of the barrel! I&#x27;m sad about it but I will just have to pay the extra $3 for something that works :)</li>
    <li> I found this to be the best product for styling my hair and keeping it shining.  Much better than the waxes.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair so stickey I could not get a brush through it and had to shampoo again right after use afer use.&lt;br /&gt;The hair powder works much better!&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so excite to receive this in the mail and it didn&#x27;t come with a top. I was going to returned but its was a hassle so I just put it in the trash.</li>
    <li> this spray really works wonders on my difficult hair&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s managable and i can make my hair do what ever i want it too&lt;br /&gt;just don&#x27;t over spray it or it gets too easy!</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews of this hairspray I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I am pretty disappointed.  With thick, naturally wavy hair, I was hoping to find a professional-level hairspray to help hold some of the texture of &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; from the morning.  I found this hairspray, in all of half a dozen attempts, to leave my hair feeling incredibly stiff immediately and then found it limp less than 20 minutes after application.  I would definitely not recommend this to a friend :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Maybe this would work for someone with thin/fine hair who is looking for volume...?)</li>
    <li> This Big Sexy Hair Flip It Over Texture Spray is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others if volume is what you are searching for.</li>
    <li> As always this is a great product.  Never leaves me feeling like I have something icky in the hair, but keeps my style going all day long!</li>
    <li> This product stays sticky for a very long time after you spray it. It&#x27;s not at all like quick-drying hair spray. On the other hand it doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff. It does the job of making your hair-do fuller.&lt;br /&gt;This store is great to do business with.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair &amp;this stuff makes it do amazing things,  it Rocks</li>
    <li> Makes you&#x27;re hair look like a sexy just got out of bed. Love it!</li>
    <li> I received Dry Shampoo instead of Texture Spray. I&#x27;m not returning as it is a hustle and I guess I can use the shampoo too but won&#x27;t be ordering from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Best texture spray I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff... I have baby fine hair... and no body whatsoever... this texture spray makes my hair look fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and needs a lot of help texture wise.  This WORKS!  But a word of caution only spray a small amount.  I flip my head over brush my hair down and spray.  Flip it back up and WOW!  My hair is short and it works for me.  If you want body and texture you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel kind of dirty.</li>
    <li> I try buying this in stores and it is just too expensive.  It was a great price and a GREAT product</li>
    <li> I ordered 6 and one of them, although sealed like all the rest, had hardly anything in the can.  I have not returned because of the expense of sending it back.  I would hesitate to order again.</li>
    <li> Made hair greasy.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> First, the can was only 1/3 full.  I informed the distributor and they shipped another full can and asked me to keep the original one.  Second, I thought this would be a dry spray and it is not.  It is almost like a hair spray consistency.  It does add volume and texture to your hair.  I am giving it to my daughter who has long, long hair and has a problem with keeping the hair on top lifted from the weight of her long hair.  Would not purchase again.</li>
