      <li>Easy to hold, clean and well made, plus the teeth of it are perfect in spacing.</li>
      <li>Having the comb portion retract into the handle is great for traveling with it, and works much better than one comb I bought that folded over because it&#x27;s stronger and more stable (doesn&#x27;t wobble around) when you use it.  </li>
      <li>Nice product to separate mascara.</li>
      <li>Teeth are very close together and works wonderfully for separating eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Your lashes will love you, (and you will love them!)</li>

      <li>After doing a thorough job researching the best eyelash comb for people with long but fine textured lashes looking for great definition, with quality being my number one criteria, this is the one I settled on.</li>
      <li>the teeth are not in there very securely and may eventually start to fall out.  </li>
      <li>Case is very cheap &amp; feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart in my hand every time I use it.</li>
      <li>I was most thankful for the reviews here and have to say I agree with the general consensus that this is the best eyelash comb on Amazon quality</li>

      <li>I was looking for something that would separate my lashes better than the one I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and great product.  </li>
      <li>Bought more.</li>
      <li>It takes many times combing them in hopes you get the look wanted.  </li>
      <li>Love this comb.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect last seperator.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the type that folds in half.&lt;br</li>
      <li>absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s retractable, too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this eyelash comb.  </li>
      <li>It also keeps it safe and clean!  </li>
      <li>one works beautifully, I love the easy retracting feature.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I really enjoy using this product and love how compact it becomes when retracted.</li>
      <li>It gets my full seal of approval!</li>
      <li>Nice thick handle for grip and retractable for safety - excellent product.</li>
      <li>For me this works better than just putting on the full amount and then combing it all.  </li>
      <li>The quality is fine</li>
      <li>was looking for an eyelash comb for fine eyelashes like mine.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, Easy to clean, easy to retract.  </li>
      <li>and I really like the way it retracts as it keeps from losing the top!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different eyelash combs over the years but this one is the best by far.  </li>
      <li>So far this is working good for me.  </li>
      <li>Good quality, bristles are metal and sharp making them effective - exercise caution when using.</li>
      <li>The higher quality combs that fold over work OK, but</li>
      <li>Pretty interesting item.</li>
      <li>Bought it due to so many reviewers stating metal comb is better than the plastic kind.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of de-clumping, especially if you do it in layers - start with a light layer of mascara, comb it out, then add another layer, comb again.  </li>
      <li>but it does help clean up the clumps.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Yes, they are right.  </li>
      <li>You certainly won&#x27;t find something like this in a store!</li>
      <li>I have no problems getting it clean, after each use I use my fingers to VERY GENTLY rub it off, and then every few days I wash it GENTLY with warm water, soap, and a very light touch with an old toothbrush.</li>
      <li>one needs to use a soft brush to get between the tines, which is just fine and dandy with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly as pictured.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought it doesn&#x27;t lock into place when extended</li>
      <li>Keep in mind, everyone has different lashes so it might work better on some.  </li>
      <li>This was definitely intimidating to use at first, but it works well; so much better than the plastic ones.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s different, that&#x27;s for sure</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already bought a second one for travel, and plan to buy more for gifts.  </li>
      <li>Sharp, effective lash comb.  </li>
      <li>I love that this one retracts, making it small and compact to fit in any make-up bag.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s very stable</li>
      <li>I really like this eyelash comb.</li>
      <li>Very Sharp!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the eyelash comb I&#x27;ve been looking for my whole life.</li>
      <li>No bleeding, no lacerations, haha.</li>
      <li>Very aquckward and it</li>
      <li>Sure beats the cheap plastic combs with thick teeth on each side that prevent one from separating corner lashes efficiently.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, just not as other reviews says it works.  </li>
      <li>The top piece of this item, the part with the comb, keeps falling down into the bottom piece.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is made of black plastic, and has a retractable head via a sliding button mechanism that is easy to operate.</li>
      <li>I like the retractable design and overall look, and it does exactly what it is intended to.  </li>
      <li>The gold colored teeth are very close together, sharp enough to easily get through clumps of mascara, yet gentle enough to not hurt myself if I accidentally get too aggressive and poke myself.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, Easy to clean, easy to retract.  Nice item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different eyelash combs over the years but this one is the best by far.  It stays in place when extended open.  The teeth are perfectly spaced to get beautiful separation in the lashes.  Once you buy this, you&#x27;ll never buy another one because it will last for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every eyelash comb on the market, and so far this one is the best.  Its teeth are sharp and set close together, so it can comb through even waterproof mascara that has dried.  Having the comb portion retract into the handle is great for traveling with it, and works much better than one comb I bought that folded over because it&#x27;s stronger and more stable (doesn&#x27;t wobble around) when you use it.  So many other combs have the teeth too far apart or dull teeth and they just don&#x27;t do the job.  Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t even bother with plastic combs; they&#x27;re useless.  This baby&#x27;s more expensive but it works and will last a long time.  I&#x27;m going to buy an extra one or two in case I lose or manage to break this one.</li>
    <li> I spent my whole life using precision tweezers to separate my eyelashes after applying mascara because those plastic eyelash combs were never pointy enough to work properly. Now I no longer need to do that. This comb has precision metal tongs that are pointy enough to really dig into clumps and separate them. This is the eyelash comb I&#x27;ve been looking for my whole life.</li>
    <li> If you want to remove clumps and separate lashes, this is your tool. It&#x27;s like a row of needles placed next to each other. Note, I use a primer as well, AND a disposable mascara brush in my arsenal. Nice thick handle for grip and retractable for safety - excellent product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited to long to get myself an eyelash pin comb, or why I balked at them being around 10 dollars. But, I finally took the plunge and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;This one works beautifully, I love the easy retracting feature. My lashes look incredible, and it&#x27;s been easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you&#x27;re debating, it&#x27;s such a small investment... go for it. Your lashes will love you, (and you will love them!)</li>
    <li> Love this comb.  Always have it in my purse!</li>
    <li> Works well-great size</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would separate my lashes better than the one I&#x27;ve been using.  This was just what I wanted -- pin like comb.  I like it; however it doesn&#x27;t do the job I expected. All the lashes don&#x27;t separate.  It takes many times combing them in hopes you get the look wanted.  It&#x27;s okay, just not as other reviews says it works.  Keep in mind, everyone has different lashes so it might work better on some.  I suggest you try it to see if it fits your needs.</li>
    <li> This does a great job separating lashes. The teeth are very sharp, so you need to be careful, but it does work. Love that it&#x27;s retractable, too.</li>
    <li> This was definitely intimidating to use at first, but it works well; so much better than the plastic ones.  You just have to be careful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect last seperator.  You&#x27;ll never have the spider clumpy lashes again with this product&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s like little fine needles separating each individual lash!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for one of these for forever.  I like the retractable design and overall look, and it does exactly what it is intended to.  I will buy again if I lose this one.</li>
    <li> A little large but works well</li>
    <li> Great product. I use Latisse and have  a lot of eyelashes. This really helps seperate and make for a beautiful look!</li>
    <li> The top piece of this item, the part with the comb, keeps falling down into the bottom piece.  It doesn&#x27;t have a locking mechanism.  I have to hold the upper piece to use this item, which is annoying.</li>
    <li> This item was a big waste of time and money. The tines are actually sharp and I really hurt myself trying to use it. The prongs are way too far apart to remove anything but the thickest gunk of mascara and it went in the trash!</li>
    <li> Sharp, effective lash comb.  Well designed.  Bought more.</li>
    <li> Excellent eyelash comb....nice size and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Pretty interesting item. I think the case protects it as well. Neat ideal. I would buy it again from this vendor</li>
    <li> Easy to hold, clean and well made, plus the teeth of it are perfect in spacing. I will definitely buy again. Never buy plastic ones,  Damser Huron</li>
    <li> Good for traveling vs. others which are unprotected.</li>
    <li> Teeth are very close together and works wonderfully for separating eyelashes. I am going to order another one. Just as described and deserves 10 stars other one I ordered didn&#x27;t match picture.</li>
    <li> Good quality, bristles are metal and sharp making them effective - exercise caution when using.</li>
    <li> So far this is working good for me.  The teeth are sharper, finer, and closer together than the plastic ones you get at the store with the eyebrow brush on the other side.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is after I clean it, when I dry it with a towel it seems like the teeth are not in there very securely and may eventually start to fall out.  They wiggle a bit.</li>
    <li> The tines on the comb are extremely sharp and actually cut my eyelid.  I would just caution anyone using it to be careful.</li>
    <li> I love this little comb but remember, it is very sharp!</li>
    <li> Works fine and is handy and safe with its closure.</li>
    <li> Caution: Teeth Are Very Sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for an eyelash comb for fine eyelashes like mine. The typical eyelash combs have teeth that are too thick and spaced too far apart. This one works great once you get the hang of it. It&#x27;s not easy to comb fine eyelashes to begin with, but then the fact that these are very sharp adds to the difficulty.</li>
    <li> Very aquckward and it stickto lashes.  Won&#x27;t help with my lashes at all.  Did not like this product at all.</li>
    <li> I first learned about this type of lashbrush from a professional make-up artist in 1989 and it&#x27;s the only lashbrush I&#x27;ve used since then!  I love that this one retracts, making it small and compact to fit in any make-up bag.  It also keeps it safe and clean!  Much better than the type that folds in half.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s value priced so I bought THREE, one for my daughter (who is just learning to wear make-up), one for me and a spare.&lt;br /&gt;BEST LASH BRUSH EVER!  You won&#x27;t regret buying it...but please use carefully, like any product you would use near or for your eyes.</li>
    <li> Works well to separate eyelashes after applying mascara.</li>
    <li> I was sadly disappointed with this item. The quality is fine and I really like the way it retracts as it keeps from losing the top! However, the metal prongs are too thick for my lashes. It just did not go through them. I tried removing a couple of prongs in between thinking that possibly that would help. The good thing is the durability. Trust me when I say that the prongs were almost impossible to remove! That means that they will not fall out when cleaning. I am sure that this would be great for someone that does not have think eyelashes. Possibly if your lashes are sparse, then it would work for you you.</li>
    <li> Nice product to separate mascara. A little awkward to use but you get used to holding it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought it due to so many reviewers stating metal comb is better than the plastic kind. Yes, they are right.  Retractable feature is necessary: although the ends are not pointy, they are small enough to cause damage in your bag/purse.  Really like the small size (don&#x27;t understand why other brands are much longer).</li>
    <li> Great, works great and stores well . Of course, as I already knew but some reviewers seem startled by, it IS sharp so watch your eyeball!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyelash comb.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Very sharp-be extra careful! Case is very cheap &amp; feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart in my hand every time I use it. I&#x27;ve had other eyelash combs that were very well made &amp; didn&#x27;t cost as much as this piece of junk.......</li>
    <li> This works great separating lashes after putting on mascara. But be careful, the tines are very sharp!</li>
    <li> absolutely love this. best eyelash comb ever. careful though it is sharp.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Extremely satisfied!!</li>
    <li> After doing a thorough job researching the best eyelash comb for people with long but fine textured lashes looking for great definition, with quality being my number one criteria, this is the one I settled on. I was most thankful for the reviews here and have to say I agree with the general consensus that this is the best eyelash comb on Amazon quality wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made of black plastic, and has a retractable head via a sliding button mechanism that is easy to operate. The gold colored teeth are very close together, sharp enough to easily get through clumps of mascara, yet gentle enough to not hurt myself if I accidentally get too aggressive and poke myself. No bleeding, no lacerations, haha. The teeth are a little difficult to get nice and clean with fingers and soap alone being so close together, so keep in mind one needs to use a soft brush to get between the tines, which is just fine and dandy with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy using this product and love how compact it becomes when retracted. You certainly won&#x27;t find something like this in a store! Sure beats the cheap plastic combs with thick teeth on each side that prevent one from separating corner lashes efficiently. I love this comb! It gets my full seal of approval!</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured.  Works great.  Quick shipping.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Compact, works well and did its job.  Since the sharp part is hidden away, it won&#x27;t poke anything it comes in contact with, like other eyelash separaters.</li>
    <li> It does what it suppose to do, but be careful, this brush is sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I saw on video that if you apply a color from mascara on this brush and comb the eyelashes with it , it wont create clamps and it work wonderful. That&#x27;s why I like this brush and will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash comb. It does a good job of de-clumping, especially if you do it in layers - start with a light layer of mascara, comb it out, then add another layer, comb again.  For me this works better than just putting on the full amount and then combing it all.  I have no problems getting it clean, after each use I use my fingers to VERY GENTLY rub it off, and then every few days I wash it GENTLY with warm water, soap, and a very light touch with an old toothbrush. At first I thought it doesn&#x27;t lock into place when extended but I discovered if I pushed it just a little farther it clicks and locks into place.  So it&#x27;s very stable and I can hold it from the base without it wobbling.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST eyelash comb out there. I&#x27;ve tried them all over the years. The plastic ones just don&#x27;t do the job.  The higher quality combs that fold over work OK, but NOTHING works as great as this lash comb. It is sturdy, easy to hold, more stable than the fold-over kind, and the teeth of the comb are just perfectly spaced. It combs through mascara beautifully to get rid of any clumps and evenly separate the lashes. The retraction feature is brilliant! I&#x27;ve already bought a second one for travel, and plan to buy more for gifts.  You will not regret purchasing this lash comb!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different, that&#x27;s for sure but it does help clean up the clumps. Just don&#x27;t be dumb and carelessly use it. It&#x27;s sharp and, just like any other product that goes near your eyes, must be handled with extreme caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace a comb I had of another style.  It does a great job.  Just be careful as the teeth are very sharp!  But it is their sharpness that makes this comb so effective!  :)</li>
    <li> Works great! Nice product!</li>
