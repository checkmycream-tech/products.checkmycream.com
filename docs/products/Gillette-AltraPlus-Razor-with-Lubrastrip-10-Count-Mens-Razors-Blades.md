      <li>I have used these for years and has always provided a good, clean shave.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable and the blades are great.</li>

      <li>He&#x27;s having a better shave again.</li>
      <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t think you can even buy an Atra Plus handle anymore, but they still sell the blades at most department stores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very good could not locate at local store any more</li>
    <li> One blade a week - for the last 25 years or more. I don&#x27;t know where these are actually made but they do the job perfectly. And you can&#x27;t buy them in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are better than the other &#x27;equivalent&#x27; blades I have tried. The others do not seem to have the correct set to the blade so they drag and snag even when new. These cut perfectly for five or six days, then it&#x27;s Monday morning and time for a new blade.</li>
    <li> Still hanging on to the old technology; don&#x27;t feel I need six blades, two continue to work just fine.</li>
    <li> The blades are not very sharp.</li>
    <li> Original and best blades ever made</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years because I love them.  They make for a great shave.  It&#x27;s too bad that it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find them.  I know that Gillette, et al., try to convince us that we need more and more blades to get the job done, which is fine....  I&#x27;m not convinced.  I&#x27;ll stick with the product as long as I can.</li>
    <li> Very good Gillette Atra Plus blades. They came quickly.</li>
    <li> Standard item -- better price</li>
    <li> Found my blades no more nicks fast shipping cant beat the price Thank You</li>
    <li> these are great blades and I got them quickly and the process was very smooth.</li>
    <li> My husband claims these are the best blades. The new-style, wide, multi-blade razors that are promoted in recent ads are too wide! The Atra are perfect.</li>
    <li> These are very hard to find locally.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Everything was great!!!!!</li>
    <li> None of my local stores carry these anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to find them and good of Gillette to keep supporting this product.&lt;br /&gt;The quality seems the same as always.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of newer designs with more blades and found the shave closeness no better and the larger heads are less maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;A simple tool for a simple task.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in the store.  I&#x27;ve been using these blades for most of my adult life.  I tried the tripple blade and the quad blades and they don&#x27;t do the job of this double blade.  Can&#x27;t find these in the stores anymore; so I thank goodness for the internet. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these blades at the stores anymore, and I don&#x27;t need a new razor.  The Atra has been around since high school and it works great.  Amazon to the rescue.  Thanks!! for</li>
    <li> Quality product, the Gillette Atra Plus razor blades are comfortable in my face and allows for full control while shaving.  They are very easy to change and fit the Gillette Vector Razor perfectly.  Item is exactly as described.  Reasonable price, great value; highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If immediately after use you blow dry the blade on low for 15-20 seconds, it slows oxidation. I received this pack March 3rd,I am still using my first blade.I shave 5-6 times weekly.Heed the word and prolong!</li>
    <li> Gillette Atra Plus cartridge is hard to find as it is an &amp;#34;oldie&amp;#34; but a &amp;#34;goodie&amp;#34; and that is what my husband insists on using.  So happy Amazon finds all these items for me that are dinosaurs....(like us) .  So thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Provides smooth ,comfortable and close shaves</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for at least twenty years, the originals did not have the lube strip hence the new name &amp;#34;Atra Plus&amp;#34; when I first started buying the original blades back in the seventies they came in a fifteen pack for $10.49 but these only come as the Atra Plus know which is fine, they are not to expensive and for a total of some 35 years I would say they give a great shave! My grandfather and my father both used the single edged blade, this pivoting twin blade was new technology back in the day and still gives the best shave today!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand and can&#x27;t find it in the stores around home</li>
    <li> This is the best blade for my face.  It is a shame it has been discontinued in the USA.</li>
    <li> great price, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old school and still like using these blades</li>
    <li> Bought for spouse.  He likes.</li>
    <li> Atra blades have been around for awhile. Unfortunately, &#x27;fits Atra&#x27; are easier to find. The ORIGINAL Atra blades last longer, are sharper, and the lubricating strip doesn&#x27;t crumble in a few shaves.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding these for a friend. They love them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave often and when I do I only shave my neck. I use an electric head razor to trim the rest of my face but I need to have a smooth neck. My skin is super sensitive and I&#x27;ve tried every brand of razor. I&#x27;ve tried the triple blades, the quadruple blades, and the vibrating diamond coated 99 blade monstrosities that are pitched as the best razors ever. I always end up with red bumps on my neck no matter what I use. I decided to get these when I saw them on sale one day. They are fantastic. They only have 2 blades and a little strip of gel to help them slide. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but these blades cut so smooth and effortlessly. I can use them about 10 times before I throw them away which for me is about a month. The only downside is that if you keep them in the shower and they stay wet they will rust after a couple weeks. All razors seem to do this so it&#x27;s not really a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and want an easy shave try these out, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I always get these razor blades to put into my Headblade.  I shave my head every other day and these are my blades of choice, and have been for a long time.  Hard to find them in-store, so Amazon to the rescue, as always.</li>
    <li> Just one of those everyday-needed items that have disappeared from the retail card hooks and shelves.  No price bargain but a great find.  Thanks to all.</li>
    <li> we were very pleased to receive these razor blade refills so fast they are exactly what we needed thank you</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades anywhere for my Altra shaver until I looked them up on Amazon.  Not only did I find them, I found them at a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have this razor and are not interested in any of the razors with more than two blades currently available. We have nicely made, high quality &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; for these refills and are not inclined to change. We have received a sample or two of shaving cartridge razors with three and four blades but they seem gimmick-y. I am just glad we can find our refills at a great price!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite blades.  They do a good job and I get several shaves from each blade.</li>
    <li> Used these for years, these seam to stay sharper and cut smoother than generic brands</li>
    <li> great price only place I could find them</li>
    <li> Exactly as I wanted, I can&#x27;t get them at stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Seems silly rating these, but the problem is - they&#x27;re getting tougher and tougher to find.  The Atra is physically the smallest blade available, so it can get places (like inside your ear)  the 4 and 5 blade nightmares can&#x27;t come close to.  I&#x27;ve used the same handles since I was in high school,  and I&#x27;ve tried every other gizmo that has come out since then - and I keep going back to the Atra.  If more people would do the same - maybe they&#x27;d keep making them longer.  I fear they are not long for the world - Gillette wants to sell the $5 each 5-blade nightmares.</li>
    <li> I have used Atra Blades for years because they are smaller and I can get those small hairs under my nose more easily. I use Mach 3 in the shower because its quick but the blade is large and I think kind of unwieldy.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find and fairly pricey here. My husband has used these for several years, he has sensitive skin, this particular one leaves his face smooth &amp; not irritated. Doesn&#x27;t cause the ingrown hairs as others seem too.</li>
    <li> Great price! It was twice as much at Walmart!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for years.  I  get a week out of a blade.  I&#x27;ve tried the overpriced and overadvertized triple blades and they don&#x27;t offer any advantage over the twin blades.  My concern is that Gillette will discontinue this product in order to force the consumer to buy the more expensive models.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s FAVORITE razor ever produced. Wish it would return.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Blades get dull pretty quickly unlike the Shick Quatro.  And not sure but seems to rust too after rinsing with water.  Could be they have it made in China now.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with the Gillette Atra Plus since I practically first started shaving.  I was (and am) getting increasingly tired of paying a heafty price for a 10-pack of these disposable blades.  These range in price from $15.97 at Wal-Mart.  To $16.97 at Target (When they have them in stock).  And just recently at Walgreen, a whopping $17.99 for a 10-pack!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased a straight razor to counteract the purchase of these expensive pesky items (and also I LOVE the close shave i get from it.  If you have never had a straight razor shave, go to a barber who does this &amp; get a shave with one.  It is THE best shave you will ever get).  While I haven&#x27;t mastered it yet, that&#x27;s including sharpening it, also it&#x27;s a bit more time consuming, I am working towards eliminating using disposible razors all together by learning how to use the Straight Razor.  I am also seriously pondering purchasing a Saftey Razor as well.&lt;br /&gt;  But until I master the straight razor (and purchase said safety razor), I will be forced to buy these.  Since I purchased the Amazon Prime in January of this year, I have begun looking more online to purchase certain items I would normally buy at the chainstores like Target or Wal-Mart.  And I was pleasantly supprised to find the Gillette Atra Plus blades for the excellent price of $13.99 (still spendy but better than the above named prices).  So until further notice I will be ordering said replacement blades from amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;  And by the way, Along with my order of these Atra Plus disposable blades, I ordered a replacement handle for my atra plus blades.  The one I currently have, while still good, might go out in the future.  I will write a review of that handle when I receive it &amp; use it.  It is not made by the Gillette Company (as they do not make them anymore in this country)  and the ones imported from Europe or Asia are not as well made (look at them &amp; the reviews here on Amazon, &amp; I think for the most part that you will agree).  I went with the one made by Super Saftey Razors.  I have been happy with the purchases I have made from their company through Amazon</li>
    <li> I have tried the Gillette Mach 3 and found it wanting. The Gillette Atra Plus Lubra Strip Cartridge is the only one that gives me a close shave and gets into those tight spots .</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette Atra Plus for over 26 years now. I still prefer the two blade cartridges over the 4-5 blades which is total nosense. I shave every other day and a single cartridge can last me one month. Given the fact that these are the cheapest blades from Gillette currently on the market, a single cartridge costs $1.45 on average so that equals out to $18 per year for shaving.  Not bad considering I shave 180 times a year. These 2 bladed Atras give me a closer shave compared to the mach 3 blades. I hear Gillette plans on phasing out the Atra Plus very soon. In fact, I don&#x27;t think you can even buy an Atra Plus handle anymore, but they still sell the blades at most department stores. This review has been updated on October 29, 2011.</li>
    <li> Great shave, can get in and out of tight spots !!!  Can get about 5 shaves per Blade.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Hard to find locally.  Good price, quick shipping, good quality.  Would purchase again for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s razor blades.  Nnot a lot of exciting things to say.</li>
    <li> I still like a close shave - that is why I still these blades.  And - they are hard to find and expensive. I loved it that I could go to my favorite source and get the same thing,  at a better price, and get free shipping.  YES!</li>
    <li> Excellent! I hope they never stop making these!!! Much closer shave than newer razors and easier to get to hard to reach areas around nose and upper lip</li>
    <li> I have no luck with the triple or quad blades because they clog up too quickly, but these dual blades are just perfect.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Atra Plus razor cartridges were the same excellent quality I have observed for most of ten or so years. But the shipping costs were outrageous! I bought a set from another source at the same time, and Amazon charged five times what the other provider charged!</li>
    <li> Provides very close shaves and lasts several weeks at one shave per day.  I have used these for years and has always provided a good, clean shave.</li>
    <li> Tired of all the 4 or 5 blade crap, not to mention the expense. Atra gives you a really good shave and more precise control.</li>
    <li> All the new-fangled razors with their multi blades don&#x27;t really satisfy my shaving desires, I&#x27;ve been partial to my Atra Plus razor for many years while I have discarded many newer systems. Then the local stores stopped carrying them. Thank You Amazon!</li>
    <li> Sharp like original and last longer!</li>
    <li> My husband has been a long time user of Gillette Atra Plus razors blades.  He has tried others, but always comes back to GAP.  He hopes Gillette never discontinues them.</li>
    <li> I use them with  the head razor, a product that in theory comes with its own proprietary -and of course super expensive - blades. These guys fit perfectly and do exactly the same job for a lot less money. Good to go.</li>
    <li> This is actually for my husband; I just found it for him when I could no longer find the Atra Plus blades where I usually shop.  He is very pleased that I found them.  They are the real thing and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> just got what I&#x27;m looking for !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just glad to be able to find these blades.  The Atra is a two blade system.  I find the 3 or more systems just clog up.  I actually liked the version without the lubricating strip better, but they can&#x27;t be found.  I&#x27;ve been using this system for something like 20+ years, maybe more.  More blades are not necessarily better.  There is a system out there where the cartridge is basically dragged like a trailer behind the handle attaching point.  I hated it.  This system is compact, thus easy to control, and works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t rocket science, it&#x27;s shaving!  Keep it simple.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to use a 3rd party blade with my Headblade, but these have worked very well. The lubrication strip could last a bit longer, but the cost savings are worth it.</li>
    <li> I have an old atra razer that still works great. I couldn&#x27;t find blades for the razer at any of the stores where I shop. Amazon had just the blades I needed. Now I can use my old razer again, and not be forced into buying the newer and much more expensive shave systems.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades around without becoming too complicated in design.  No 5 or 6 blade surfaces, etc.  I&#x27;ve used them for over 20 years, but they are becoming more and more difficult to find.  Not available in local stores.  Keep making them please.</li>
    <li> These blades shave every bit as good as a tri or quad blade and have been using them for years.  However, they have increased their prices lately and I&#x27;m almost to the point I will cancel my subscription if they increase the price one more cent.  Update: Cancelled, won&#x27;t pay almost 14.00 for 10 blade. Bought 100 compatible blades on Amazon for dirt cheap price and they work great.</li>
    <li> For those men like my father, this was an excellent gift.  He doesn&#x27;t use other brand names. It is good that can be order online and shipped every three months to him. I will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Finally, my day is complete. I found the perfect razor blades. I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on fancy 3,4,5 blade systems and razors. Couldn&#x27;t get a good shave. I always preferred the 2 blade razor, but can&#x27;t find them anymore. I tried Gillette Atra. Wow! The smoothest and the closest shave I have ever had. I can only hope they continue to be made and sold. Also glad I found them on this website. I threw out all my other shaving razors and blades.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using these blades for a number of years and now the only place to find them(we find) is on the internet.  So they must be working well for him ??? or I don&#x27;t think he would ask me to order more.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I think these are the best razors available. I do not understand or like the trend for 4 and 5 bladed razors. They are very expensive and unnecessary for a good shave. I had to purchase a new handle from Ebay but continue to use these wonderful razors. I think there should be a reintroduction of these. The heck with those crazy multiple bladed razors.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> So glad I was able to track this item down.  It&#x27;s the best and I hope you will be able to supply it in the future 👍</li>
    <li> Great!! Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price</li>
    <li> A great blade and a great price to. The store near here never seems to have them so I get them from Amazon, and they are $6 cheaper.</li>
    <li> Gillette Atra is mine.  These shave better and last longer than any of those disposables with rows of blades.  Only thing better is going to my barber for a straight razor shave with the hot towels and lather.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the new razors out there, I prefer the sharpness and shave from these blades and from the Atra plus razor.</li>
    <li> Been using these blades for over 20 years. Always get a smooth shave, Don&#x27;t need the new fancy and expensive 5 blade shavers to get the same results as I do with these, and I have tried the 5 blade razors.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my boyfriend because they&#x27;re all he ever uses, and is not really available in stores anymore. I&#x27;ve used the blades a few times and they are really smooth and shave very closely. Gillette is well known for having quality razors and blades so I am not surprised.</li>
    <li> Atra was discontinued by Gillette.  Blades are scarce.  This is the only other source I can find for these discontinued blades for my Atra razor, They are the real thing and just as expensive as they were in the drugstore.</li>
    <li> These seem to be the generic version - they cut my legs versus the same product in the stores that I buy</li>
    <li> I always use these Cartridge. Always get from them. They are very prompt in service</li>
    <li> Best price ever bought them for my husband</li>
    <li> Always a smooth save. Each blade last longer than single or triple blades.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> feels like the real thing.  Pricy but I can stand the tripple quad blade jobbies.</li>
    <li> WHY DID THEY DISCONTINUED THEM IS BEYOND ME.  THEY WORK GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for at least 30 years or so. All my life. I can&#x27;t remember any other razors. Whatever else I try, it does not come close  to this. It&#x27;s small, gets into corners, and lasts a long time. They are very hard to find now. I hope Gillette does not stop making those. The new blades suck in comparison.</li>
    <li> Reasonably-priced; now hard to find in many grocery or drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the &amp;#34;real thing,&amp;#34; and fit my (old) Atra pivoting razor well.  Exactly as-described, and retain an edge well.</li>
    <li> These are the blades I&#x27;ve used for decades and am so happy to find them on Amazon.  I always get a smooth, easy close shave!</li>
    <li> These razor blades are hard to find in the store and when you do they are far too expensive. These are the real things (not a knock off, I&#x27;ve tried that and they REALLY don&#x27;t work) and at a good price. Fast delivery too. Why switch to a new razor with 3,4,5 blades. Just more expensive and doesn&#x27;t shave any better. Thanks for making these still available.</li>
    <li> These appear to work much better (i.e. a cleaner, smoother shave) than the generic brand Altra Plus cartridge; time will tell if the blade lasts as long -- or longer. But for now, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase and I won&#x27;t be going back to the generic brand.</li>
    <li> Excellent, best blade I had</li>
    <li> Much better than the three or five blade razors</li>
    <li> Gillette Atra is the pinnacle of razor performance and efficiency. None of the newer designs shave better and they can be considerably more expensive. I&#x27;ve been using Atra since 1982 and don&#x27;t see any reason to pay more for the new exta-blade designs. Another advantage besides the cost is that I can save space in my long-term travel kit by using one handle and a pack of ten blades vice trying to pack ten whole, plastic-handled razors in a way that they don&#x27;t break or lose the plastic blade covers. When I deployed in the Navy, one ten pack  would last for a 6-10 month deployment and I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about shopping for replacements when I had more important things to deal with. I do not deploy with the Navy anymore but I travel into undeveloped areas for long periods of time and I still prefer the portability of Atra. I also liked the somewhat personalized aspect of being able to choose from a variety of handles, or even have a custom one, like in the old straight-razor days. Atra handles are more like real tools and I find them more aesthetically appealing than the plastic, throw away models. I have a custom 14K gold handle with sterling silver filigree and knurling that I want to use, not put in a museum. it has character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like adding trash plastic to the waste stream. Dolphins don&#x27;t like plastic handled razors floating endlessly in the gyre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette, Please keep making this product. It fills a market niche because not all consumers buy into the newer is better philosophy. If you want to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; costs in producing Atra blades, you could get rid of the silly lubrication strip. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the blade and is redundant if you use shaving cream or soap, and water.</li>
    <li> Atra Razor Blades are very hard to find and they are my husbands . He is very pleased I found them for him .</li>
    <li> It was very good blade.Good shave.It is very safe  w ith no cuts in the face.Thank you for selling it</li>
    <li> Better than the triple or quadruple blades. Still way too expensive!</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband needed.  Arrived quickly.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I used these blades in the 80s and now I went back to these blades. They work great and I save allot of money.</li>
    <li> This is a great blade that is hard to find in retail that fits the Atra razor.  Gillette has moved to different models but I like this blade and it gives a smooth, clean and safe shave.</li>
    <li> I selected. I paid. The product shipped. I received it. I&#x27;m using it. The system worked as designed and expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin</li>
    <li> Extremely competitive price.</li>
    <li> Great !!! They are no longer sold in stores.</li>
    <li> Of course I still buy these, as I have two of original Atra Plus heavy stainless shavers. Smooth and comfortable and they last many shaves.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this type of cartridge for years.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores and very happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> Received on date expected found them to be everything I&#x27;d hoped for.  I now have a source for my blades!!</li>
    <li> They do what t I expected them to do.  Good quality Chinese Gillette blades!</li>
    <li> How do you think I&#x27;d feel about a product I&#x27;ve been using for decades?</li>
    <li> I am glad that I can still find these blades. My handle is still useful after many years so why not keep using the Gillette Altra blades?</li>
    <li> My husband has been using these for YEARS and he wants to continue to use them. He says they give him the closest shave. I am grateful I can still buy these on Amazon because they are no longer available in stores. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of blades for years and really love the track 2 I wouldn&#x27;t change anything else</li>
    <li> My husband has been using these blades for over 25 years.  We cannot find them in local stores anymore so started ordering them from amazon.com  He says they are not as good as they use to be.  He does not get as many shaves per cartridge as in the past.  For now he will continue to use but might soon be checking out other options.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  Works great.  Why change when one is comfortable with it?  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> nice product, fast ship</li>
    <li> Just exactly what my husband wanted and needed, so he didn&#x27;t have to purchase a new-fangled razor.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re razor blades and work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores so I am thrilled that I found on Amazon - I love my razor and didn&#x27;t want to switch..  I prefer men&#x27;s razors as they are sharper and easier to use than some of the bulky women&#x27;s razors. I have been using this razor for 10 years and was so upset when I thought I would have to switch. Hopefully they will continue to be available on Amazon or back in the stores at some point.</li>
    <li> These were priced better here on Amazon (we are PRIME members) than we found anywhere locally - including all Walgrens, Walmarts, CVS&#x27;s, Target, etc.  These are what my husband likes -- finally found a place to save money on them.</li>
    <li> Good blades for the money.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this blade. They stay sharp longer than the others so the price is reasonable. He refuses to use the others I have bought him. It isn&#x27;t that easy to find them, so I&#x27;m happy to have my &amp;#34;go to site&amp;#34; when I need to buy these blades.</li>
    <li> I love me some AtraPlus razors! I have been using them about 30 years. I wish Gillette still kept them in the stores, but alas...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 1 year now. I use them on my headblade, and the shave is just about perfect every single time! No knicks or cuts, and a smooth shave. I shave my head every day or sometimes every other day, and the blades can last me for longer than 1 month. I usually dry them after each use, wash regularly with hot water, and that keeps them sharp. LOVE these things!</li>
    <li> Good for the price and not as expensive as going with a higher blade count in the cartridge. Good close shaves, but they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as they used to (I don;t think my beard is getting any tougher). Get less than a week out a cartridge.</li>
    <li> These work great in my Headblade! Smooth shaved head, no nicks or cuts. I recommend them to any Headblade owners</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find them in a store anymore so I buy online.  Won&#x27;t use any other blade.</li>
    <li> love my old razor great to still find the blades</li>
    <li> Hard to find blades and the Atra holder. This has been one of the most face friendly razors and blades I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;However my beard is not heavy but I have been shaving for over 40 years.</li>
    <li> Happy that I can still purchase the blades that I have been using for years!  Amazon certainly makes life easier by giving me access to things I can no longer find in local stores.</li>
    <li> Still love my old razor.</li>
    <li> Searched local stores for my husband&#x27;s favorite razor blades, thought they might have discontinued making them, very relieved when I found them on Amazon. Same price I used to pay at Walmart, now get them in my mailbox. Thank you.</li>
    <li> great price, on time.....just what i ordered :-)</li>
    <li> Received early!!  So nice and was exactly as purchased/described</li>
    <li> I love my old simple razor!  Tried one of the new multiblade razors included with two cans of shave gell from Sam&#x27;s.  I have a partial beard and need to shave along the lower part of my chin line.  I find it VERY difficult to do this with the 5 blade razors!  Just can&#x27;t control it.  Afraid I am going to cut my throat!  Gave the fancy thing to my wife to shave her legs with and bought a bunch of these blades for me.  Still on my first blade after at least a month!  Works great, I can control it, and it is still very sharp!  Going to order up some more for as long as I can!</li>
    <li> Purchased to go with the Indian version of Atra..Vector..I think.  The razor says these fit but nope.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> These blades met my expections.</li>
    <li> Everything as promised.  Would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is the only blade my husband likes to use. We used to be able to buy it in the stores (expensive) but when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, I went to Amazonsmile.com and there they were!</li>
    <li> Great Price. Have Used This Blade For Years. !!!</li>
    <li> Good product, good service</li>
    <li> They dont make them like this anymore...they handle the heavier beards much easier.</li>
    <li> only blade my husband likes......none of the newer generation blades work for him</li>
    <li> Been looking for these blades for a while. Use then to trim lib.</li>
    <li> The price was very reasonable and the blades are great. Reccommended</li>
    <li> A lot less expensive than in big box stores.</li>
    <li> I got these for my husband after his off brands were being discontinued in our shopping area.  This was at a price we could not turn down, the Atra Plus 10-pack is so expensive even in mass merchandise stores. He&#x27;s having a better shave again. Please keep these in stock, he said we will continue to order as long as these are available!</li>
    <li> these were for my husband. he dows&#x27;nt like anything else&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Great for the original Headblade.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I hung on to my 2 old Atra handles.  I took a chance looking for the blades here on Amazon and was so happy to find them!&lt;br /&gt;I just checked to order more and discovered they went up $3.20 since Aug. 25, 2014 when I last ordered.  That&#x27;s a huge increase in such a short amount of time.I give it 4 stars because of the huge price increase in just 2 1/2 wks time.</li>
    <li> My son loves thesr Gillette Blades, but they are no longer availiable in the stores any more.</li>
    <li> Why these razor companies change good products that work great with expensive razors has always been a mystery to me.  My dad and I have used the Atra plus for over 20 years and nothing comes close.  We have tried them all and NONE work like this razor.  Thank goodness I can still find the replacements, and will continue to do so for as long as they make them.</li>
    <li> Hard to find .  As described and on time.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> seem to be not quite up to par, seem to get dull a lot faster than previous blades.</li>
    <li> These razor blades do not fit onto the All Metal heavyweight Chrome ATRA compatible Twin blade Rzor, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have tried other blades but this is the best that I have used.</li>
</ol>
