<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Skin feels smooth and Shine immediately after applying. I am happy about my Purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to amazon for introducing me to World of Products. I will buy this for my sister/cousin/Sister in Law blah blah too&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  It absorbs into your skin instantly and leaves it feeling and looking great!  IT is a must have.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this cream. a little goes a long way. It helps even out uneven skin tones. not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I believe it&#x27;s the real deal. My skin absorbs this fairly quickly, and feels like silk. I use the day moisturizer over it, as recommended. I&#x27;m 55 y.o., and my esthetician said my skin looked really good, when I went for a facial yesterday (first one in several years).</li>
    <li> Ordered this from BulBul Cosmetics via Amazon and AFTERWARD got theresponse below from the company saying they are going to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; my order to something else without asking me first.  This &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; product is NOT the same thing and looks super cheap!  Double check you are not ordering from BulBul Cosmetics.  I&#x27;m currently fighting for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Our valued customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thank you for your interest in our store and would like to inform you that with this new year celebration,&lt;br /&gt;we decided to give our customers a nice upgrade gift from us and sent instead of the  Vivo Per Lei Vitamin C Facial Serum&lt;br /&gt;the new upgrade Vivo per lei Vitamin C serum  from the New  Diamond collection with the old version price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are sure you will like  this New product and also our service and prompt delivery timing&lt;br /&gt;and hope you will give us the 5-star rating as something else will hurt us deeply.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> never had a better product. feels wonderful on the face. great value and will purchase again. will be purchasing more soon</li>
    <li> Got the product yesterday. The box looks very fancy and so does the jar. First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is very strong. As soon as you open the lid you can smell it. So if smell is an issue, this might be a problem. It smells a bit flowery and I actually really like it. So this is not an issue for me. Once you put it on, I can&#x27;t say that the smell is floating around me or anything. But then again can&#x27;t say that I would totally mind if it did.&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way. I know this is true for most serums, but especially true for this one. When you apply it, it seems almost a little oily. A tiny drop can cover an entire cheek, chin and half a nose. Do not fear the \\&quot;oily part\\&quot;. Let it absorb for a minute or two and your skin is perfectly smooth and looks as if nothing was applied at all (aka total absorption with no residue).&lt;br /&gt;- Goes well under moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;- My skin seems to like it. Feels smooth to the touch and pores seem much smaller. Did I mention it was my first day using it?&lt;br /&gt;If you like this line, I also highly recommend [[ASIN:B003SSTL42 Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Smells good and I think it works. Skin is smoother, less blemishes, and smaller pores. Even though I have oily skin, this does not leave my skin oily at all. The transaction was great. User: 21 year old latin female with oily skin.</li>
    <li> this is a great serum you do not have to use too much&lt;br /&gt;it really softens your face&lt;br /&gt;I really like it as far as wrinkiles they seem to be more faint in appearance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same amazing results. I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but thanks God I bought this. The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and price was wonderful, I shared it with a friend who works in a spa and she wanted this product, she said this was the best product better then any she has used on clients .</li>
    <li> it does the job faster,than anything else,i tried it takes just a few days to see the differense. and its affoddable</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes your skin feel so soft.  Good for daily use. I buy several at a time to be sure i do not run out.</li>
    <li> Love how it leaves my skin. .. very silky. I use it all the time. I wish there was one that has sunscreen, though.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this feels when I apply.  I haven&#x27;t used long enough to know how if my skin will improve.</li>
    <li> Sent this product back.  It made my skin greasy and caused a break out. Better products can be found in the drugstore isle... or make your own using Vitamin C tablets.</li>
    <li> At first it goes on oily, but it soaks in and then feels soft and moist.&lt;br /&gt;Find that it works pretty good!</li>
    <li> l have been wanting a serum for a long time and just couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg! I love this serum! The packaging is beautiful and  the product makes my skin feel soft and supple. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> From ordering to receiving the product arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second order. I find the cream to be soothing and  helps my skin look smoother ,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. Thank You, Fawn</li>
    <li> Product is nice.  It feels very smooth on my skin.  I use one squirt for my face, and the leftover on my neck.  My husband says I smell fruity with it!  I&#x27;ll need more time to know if it works.  I just wanted something nice and professional to start to use on my skin as I work outside and need to start to keep those wrinkles at bay.</li>
    <li> I love how this product gives my face a dewy feel.  It is a great base under my moisturizer .  5 stars !</li>
    <li> Love this serum. I mix it in with my sunscreen so that it makes the natural sunscreens emollient. It is also a great base/primer for makeup. I just bought 2 more.</li>
    <li> This was love at first try! Must try it to understand the instant clean feeling of your face. I was surprised to find I only needed a very small amount to cover my entire facial area. FANTASTIC product at a Fantastic price. You cannot help but be satisfied to the extreme with this facial serum. Has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Me enviaron el producto prácticamente vacío. Al principio creí que el dispensador no funcionaba, así que imaginad mi cara cuando abrí el bote y vi que casi no había producto. No lo compréis. Es un timo.</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth and silky and really nourishes your skin before you use your moisturizer. I would really recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Smells great. Looks like it has some oils inside, which helps make the skin dewy and radiant.</li>
    <li> So far the product has been fine. Hasn&#x27;t caused any rashes or bad things to happen to my face. I use the Vivo face cream and face wash and I like them very much so I a hoping this is as good.</li>
    <li> for the price, it was a great deal.  will  definitely buy again.  I bought this product in place of a very expensive one, that  i used in the past, and this one felt and worked just exactly the same.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It&#x27;s my first time ever using a serum and it makes my face so soft and smooth. I used it after my daily moisturizer and before my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Use this after the toner and before you moisturizer or night cream. Just a very small amount and your skin feels like silk!</li>
    <li> I just love the Vitamin C Facial Serum, it feels like silk on the skin and smells wonderful.  I ordered another one so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with a set that was brought back from Hawaii.  Have not used it long enough to tell.</li>
    <li> Adore this product.  Very light, smells lovely and it&#x27;s vitamin c which is so great for the face. Just started using it a month ago and can already see a difference!</li>
    <li> it is very good product, and I gave it to my friend like a birthday&#x27;s gift, she was very happy with it, thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Makes my face feel wonderful. Effects on my skin is great. My face feels so smooth, refreshed and healed after a day of stress and polution. I used to use a vitamin \\&quot;C\\&quot; skin serum from another manufacturer about 15 years ago but for some reason they stopped producing it. I loved it then and I love it now.</li>
    <li> Tried this product with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The product did what it said and more. My pores are barely visible and my face has a radiant glow. I recieve compliments often and questions about what I using. I also use the facial wash and day and night cream.</li>
    <li> Smells like children&#x27;s tylenol, and is very greasy. Besides that I have nothing to report yet, will update after a few uses. Great packaging though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: think it is the packaging that is behind that originally huge price-tag. There are too many emmollients  (minral oils, vaselines) in this for it to be high quality because they cause the product to just form a film on the skin. This may be protective and therefore preventive, but I recommend mixing it with another lotion or sunscreen. Used underneath other lotions meant to penetrate, such a rich night cream, this serum with hinder absorption. It needs to be mixed. use the back of your hand and rub in the extra there to add niceness to your hands! Also this serum is likewise excellent as a primer for around the nose and upper lip. It fills in pores and small lines without being absorbed, so it can smooth out skin under a foundation which is also meant to sit on the skin. If used entirely by itself at night or AFTER everything else has sunk in completely, it will be very slippery, almost like their is a silicone in it. I&#x27;ll checK the ingredients and find out! Update to come real soon!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it ..it make&#x27;s my face feel fabulous ..this is my 3rd bottle ...must have product!</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s for many years. This was my first time using this product and it was by far the best Vitamin C Facial Serum that I have ever used! It goes on very smooth and leaves your face feeling very smooth! I will use this Serum from now on.</li>
    <li> I would like to write a review, but I have hardly been able to use this product, I just finished my other product and wanted to start using this, but the pump is not working.  I know I bought this in February , but only needed it now. Is there any help to get??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herdis Johansen</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Well worth the price same as orogold. I paid a lot more for the oro gold.</li>
    <li> Works beautully in any skin.clears tone  and also acts as mousterizer.I love it Good for any age group try it.</li>
    <li> Got a great deal on this when I bought it, which is the only reason I was able to try it. Loved it. Wish I could afford it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum and will be ordering more.  The price is good compared to other products, it is not oily, and seems to penetrate the skin well.</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old and this product has made my skin so smooth. Someone told me about Vit C and how it worked for them. I was purchasing other Vivo products and saw this and decided to try it. I have been blessed to have good genes and do not have wrinkles, just a few fine lines. I have noticed my face is smoother and brighter. I use it with the Vivo moisturizer and the two together feel great on my face. At first I was using way to much, a little goes a long way. I now use the size of a pea, it covers my entire face and neck. It smells so good, I love the way this smells, it&#x27;s hard to describe the smell but I really like it. If you don&#x27;t like smells in your face serums or creams you might not like this. I do recommend this product and the company I ordered it from was awesome, they sent it to me quickly and the product was as described and new.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS A DELIGHTFUL SMELL, GOES ON SMOOTHLY AND PENETRATES QUITE RAPIDLY.  HAVE BEEN USING 2-3 WEEKS AND NOTICE  LESS DRYNESS AND A GREAT TEXTURE.  EASY TO USE AND GREAT PACKAGING  A SMALL AMOUNT COVERS A LARGE AREA..</li>
    <li> I really love this serum. I put it on my face after I cleansed and I put this on first. AFterwards, after it soaks in I put on the Vivo Per Lei moisturizer. My skin feels softer and younger. I never thought a product would actually help but this does. I love the smell of this as well. Not offensive, very nice! In my opinion, its a must in your beauty chest!</li>
    <li> I like this and use as part of my night time care regiment. I was using it in conjunction with a new salicylic acid toner along with other stuff I bought so I&#x27;m not sure if my skin improvement is solely to this. I had been breaking out alot along my chin line, cheeks and forehead recently but that has now cleared up and my general skin quality has improved. I liked it though because it seems luxurious with its packaging. The bottle came nestled in its own cushioned box that was high quality, definitely not a throwaway box. When I tried to price check, I found the $ for other online websites was &amp;#62;$100!! I paid under $20 for this, which is on the higher end of what I tend to spend on skin products considering the amount of product you get. The texture of the product is smooth but I feel like it can make your skin look oily but I think of it as essential oil for your skin. If you are going to use int he day time make sure it&#x27;s under some type of makeup. I used it with BB cream and it was perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> Gives my face a healthy glow. I will definitely order this product again and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Thru the years tried many facial serums. The best yet! Used nightly before night cream, and daily before your day cream.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to lots of friends!!!</li>
