<li> It isn&#x27;t terrible, but it is kind of mediciney.  </li>
<li> Keeps my face moisturized without a heavy scent.</li>
<li> I love this after shave balm and am very disappointed Nivea stopped making it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s exactly what you want to apply to your face after a tough shave with some cold, hard steel.  </li>
<li> I would give it five stars, but there are two very small issues I have with it.  </li>
<li> This balm came from a bad or expired batch.  </li>
<li> It smelled terrible, and was EXTREMELY painful to apply to a shaved face.  </li>

    <li> Nivea Cooling Shaving Balm is my favorite and is one of the few that still lets you feel a cooling warmth on your skin.  It&#x27;s for us men who like the soft &#x27;burn&#x27; sensation of menthol on freshly shaved skin!</li>
    <li> My husband has \\&quot;Irish\\&quot; skin and this keeps his face in good condition.  Hard to find locally.  Not greasy..just makes his post shave a nice finish.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well.  Better than anything else I have tried.  I would give it five stars, but there are two very small issues I have with it.  1) The smell.  It isn&#x27;t terrible, but it is kind of mediciney.  That fades, though.  2) Glass bottles?  I have a tile floor in my bathroom.  Maybe plastic bottles aren&#x27;t as classy, but they are more foot friendly if dropped.    I&#x27;ll still be re-ordering when I run out.  I have sensitive skin, and this works well.</li>
    <li> I normally use the \\&quot;soothing\\&quot; variety of this product but Amazon was out so I figured I might as well get this.  Big mistake.  I have sensitive skin and the menthol burns when you put this on.  If you have any cuts it will burn big time.  I&#x27;m getting more used to it than initially but I still have multiple bottles to go through.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I once got it on sale for very cheap. I have now been using it for over 5 years. It stings a little when you rub it on but it really cools your skin good. Also, its fast drying. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Like the smell and feel good on skin,after shave</li>
    <li> A really good quality product. Smells great, and the menthol is like a fresh slap in the face after a shave. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was made in Germany as well, and comes in a glass bottle, believe it or not.</li>
    <li> This balm came from a bad or expired batch.  It smelled terrible, and was EXTREMELY painful to apply to a shaved face.  I will never buy from this seller again.  I have since bought the same product (a single bottle) in Albertson&#x27;s and it was much better than this Amazon version.</li>
    <li> I recently bought my second four pack of this balm.  Good product and reasonably priced.  I gave some to my son and son-in-law, and they concur.</li>
    <li> I use this after I use my alum block.  It makes my face so supple and smooth and soft and it smells great too! It has a great tingly feel too, not over powering, just nice!</li>
    <li> This is my tried and true face moisturizer; I put it on every single morning after my electric shave. Keeps my face moisturized without a heavy scent. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Have been using this for over 2 years. As described, it is cooling and refreshing with a very mild and pleasant aroma. Love the glass container as opposed to plastic. Price is right at Amazon. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great on a very good product very fast shipping</li>
    <li> I wondered why this 4-pack was so inexpensive.  It is the same great Nivea aftershave but with the most horrible smelling scent in the world.  In fact, Nivea has discontinued this scent....  No wonder it was about 1/4 of the price you would normally pay for NIvea in a store.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!  It&#x27;s exactly what you want to apply to your face after a tough shave with some cold, hard steel.  The cooling properties it imparts makes the shave worthwhile.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a good vocabulary for describing scents, but I find this one light, not too floral, and consistent with a refreshing after-shave lotion.</li>
    <li> I love it..i use it on my face and head</li>
    <li> I love this after shave balm and am very disappointed Nivea stopped making it.  I would have been a Nivea guy for life!</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you expect at a cheaper price than at a retailer. Shipped fast and safely packed. And Made in Germany quality</li>
    <li> love this product. awesome. not greasy. goes on much better than most other lotion/aftershaves i have used in the past. have it on auto order.</li>
    <li> Fast service - great product ... just as advertised.</li>
    <li> One of the best post shave balms in the market. Feels great after a shave!</li>
