      <li>but after a wash my hair has more volume...</li>
      <li>I started to adapt and even felt more hair loss along the years as i went to college.</li>
      <li>I just ordered 3 more bottles and hope this continues.  </li>
      <li>one more time and notice once more the difference and regret skipping its usage because today I believe I would have been with more hair.</li>
      <li>Hair stop falling, baby hairs growing, healthy nails,</li>
      <li>but it seems to be working on me better.</li>
      <li>And also, I am now able to touch my hair and nothing comes through my fingers.</li>
      <li>Well, I have thinning hair and it doesn&#x27;t grow more hair</li>
      <li>The product is authentic as shown on TV.</li>
      <li>this products reduce problem and give me a healthy hair again.</li>
      <li>With most products that claim to do this or that one cannot expect miracles.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is ok.  </li>
      <li>I tried many things and even got a discount in one of my demartologist visit since they didn&#x27;t have an answer for it.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good shampoo for the price.</li>
      <li>And then, the most important, my hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing great, but I have to admit that using this natural ingredients got rid of dandruff.</li>
      <li>I  think my hair has not improved at all, the product is too strong for me</li>
      <li>Although is a great product there is something I dislike but at the same time I go along with it.</li>
      <li>And my hair is long and beautiful(: &amp; thats</li>
      <li>if that works this seems more natural and is probably better.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many, many hair shampoo&#x27;s and this is the only</li>
      <li>ive been using for five months following directions perfectly and no results only makes hair feel thicker</li>
      <li>However it does tend to dry out the hair and requires a good conditioner to balance it out.</li>
      <li>In some cases the products are good and may not work for a certain human beings.</li>
      <li>Many products ads bombard us and it is hard to determine what&#x27;s really good.</li>
      <li>Other relatives there have used it with good success.</li>
      <li>Maybe for other costumers will be good</li>
      <li>Right now not works for me</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t think that the whole head will be filled with hair by using the first bottle and don&#x27;t think that it will make miracles for severe cases.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the pills, my nails are growing so fast and strong.</li>
      <li>Very promising...</li>
      <li>I was better off shampooing with actual poo.</li>
      <li>First, my nails.</li>
      <li>i actually lost more hair using it</li>
      <li>but I need to following the treatment for more time, thats why i buy the package of the three products.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I try this product</li>
      <li>It went straight to the trash!</li>
      <li>i was introduced to Mexican hair products during my last trip there, this is good shampoo.  </li>
      <li>i had to use more of this shampoo just to clean my hair , it didnt do any thing any different to my hair as well nothen good to really say sorry but</li>
      <li>It turns my fine, soft hair into a complete rats nest that i had to re-wash and condition in order to get a brush through it.</li>
      <li>and my har hasn&#x27;t fallen off as much and looks and feels thicker..</li>
      <li>haha..</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
      <li>them promised me a second item for free.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been usi.g it for 3 weeks now &amp; my hair is not falling as much as it use to it</li>
      <li>maybe the hype on this product was just too much?</li>
      <li>this thing really works if u dont want ur hair to fall of ?     </li>
      <li>VERY watery.... poured some on my hand and</li>
      <li>Also the delivery was very fast..received the product in about 2 days</li>
      <li>really works!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product is working very well</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s good shampoo although I have used several bottles and do not see any difference as far as re-growing hair.</li>
      <li>, I know some products your hair falls off at first then grows new one</li>
      <li>dont get it ur better of using any other shampo</li>
      <li>It is hard to accept that the world is full deceptions in many areas of our lives.</li>
      <li>I used the shampoo daily for over 3 months and only noticed a healthier looking and feeling scalp, which is good, but doesnt give me any hair back.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I guess my expectations were too high or</li>
      <li>i would highly recomend revivogen</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo a little.</li>
      <li>My husband has been using it for just over two weeks and there are new hairs growing in where it had stopped growing along the hairline on his forehead.</li>
      <li>There are also new hairs growing all over his scalp.</li>
      <li>I have my hair cut down pretty short which made it easy to see some hairs that were noticably longer than the hairs around them.  </li>
      <li>I notice my hair stopped falling completely!</li>
      <li>But my hair started to fall off more, not sure if I was stressed or what, but it freaked me out</li>
      <li>All clear.</li>
      <li>Have used this product for a month now and my hairfall has considerably reduced.</li>
      <li>Also, the label lies, because the ingredients are FAR from all-natural.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m 22 years old.</li>
      <li>then three and finally complete in six.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is part of a treatment plan for professional results you need to purchase as part of a hair growth or restoration treatment plan.</li>
      <li>Makes hair soft</li>
      <li>I am 27 years old woman.</li>
      <li>Takes six months for the therapy to completely work</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this product is working very well, I&#x27;m happy with it, I&#x27;m just still in the process using it, so I&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I have been following the directions, massaging the shampoo in and leaving it for about 5 minutes. The frequency of the hair loss seems to be down over the period of three weeks. There are some days were I don&#x27;t lose any strands of hair opposed to losing strands every single day. Anyways until I stop losing strands the jury is still out.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a month now and my hairfall has considerably reduced. Not sure if it regrows hair but after a wash my hair has more volume... Also the delivery was very fast..received the product in about 2 days</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law brought some of this back from Mexico for my husband to try because he has a receding hairline. Other relatives there have used it with good success. My husband has been using it for just over two weeks and there are new hairs growing in where it had stopped growing along the hairline on his forehead. There are also new hairs growing all over his scalp. Very promising...</li>
    <li> As others have said it, Cre C Max Shampoo does not work overnight! I have always had long thick hair and never had problems with hair loss until a few months ago my hair started falling out in chunks, fell out so much that now I can see my scalp without parting my hair and small bald spots. After about 4 weeks of using cre c max I notice my hair stopped falling completely! It also left my hair feeling thick and looking healthy. I followed the directions on the bottle and used cre c max everyday. I am now on my second bottle and still no hair fall. I even stop using the product for a week and I still had no hair fall. I can now see baby hairs growing out. When it comes to hair you must give it time for the hair falling to stop and especially for the hair to re-grow (also know that it&#x27;s normal to have 100 hairs fall out daily, this I learned from my doctor). I love cre c max shampoo and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I alternate this with the tio nacho and even my son who&#x27;s balding .. his hair is growing back</li>
    <li> i had to use more of this shampoo just to clean my hair , it didnt do any thing any different to my hair as well nothen good to really say sorry but good luck to ever one els ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;polly israel</li>
    <li> Good product, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good shampoo for the price. However it does tend to dry out the hair and requires a good conditioner to balance it out.</li>
    <li> I used it for like 2 months.  But my hair started to fall off more, not sure if I was stressed or what, but it freaked me out so I stopped using it.  My sister had told me my hair looks thicker and asked what I was doing? and if I had hair implants or what.. haha.. at that time all I was using was Ovation, and I figured hey if that works this seems more natural and is probably better.  My hair thined out and every day I was loosing a lot of hair I don&#x27;t know if it was because I stopped using ovation or if it was because of this shampoo.  But I&#x27;m afraid to use it now, I know some products your hair falls off at first then grows new one but I can&#x27;t afford to loose my hair if that&#x27;s the case.  I started to use the ovation again and my har hasn&#x27;t fallen off as much and looks and feels thicker.. I can rub my hair wit my hands and I don&#x27;t feel the scalp any more.  Has any one had a similar experience?</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo just one month ago.  My hairline has been on a slow retreat for the past few years as I am approaching age 49.  I saw this advertised on Univision when my wife was watching her Spanish news.  I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.  Like I stated before, I have only been using this product for one month.  I looked in the mirror this morning and saw a couple of hairs that were almost an inch long growing where my hairline used to be.  I also noted numerious baby hairs springing up around the same area.  I have my hair cut down pretty short which made it easy to see some hairs that were noticably longer than the hairs around them.  One day my hair is all the same length and suddenly I have these longer hairs that seem to have had miracle grow thrown on them.  I just ordered 3 more bottles and hope this continues.  I will follow up after another month.  As of now I can say the product is working well for me.  Best of luck.</li>
    <li> i use this and i take Biotin plus iron vitamines 2 weeks only and my hair stops falling down</li>
    <li> This product came quickly,  It is easy to use, it has a nice oder to it, BUT I cant see any change in my hair growth at all in over a month of use, but Im still using it every day hopping thing will start to happpen.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it helps at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month with no results. Also, the label lies, because the ingredients are FAR from all-natural. It contains methylparaben and sodium lauryl sulfate, both of which are horrible for your skin and hair and have highly detrimental side-effects.    I would definitely NOT recommend this.</li>
    <li> Bad product. Don&#x27;t buy this product I&#x27;m still losing hair and I&#x27;m 22 years old. It makes my hair thick but in a weird way and I&#x27;m still losing hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 or 3 months and i don&#x27;t see any positive results, any results!!!!</li>
    <li> this thing really works if u dont want ur hair to fall of ?     it regrow hair butt 100 % rating not to fall &lt;?</li>
    <li> this product will not stop hairloss, however it does regrow hair after using cre c max for about five months+ i have noticed baby hairs growing to stop hairlass i would highly recomend revivogen</li>
    <li> U sigo usándolo esperare resultados</li>
    <li> With most products that claim to do this or that one cannot expect miracles. This shampoo has a lot of claims to it that it works. Only it doesn&#x27;t work over night. And like a lot of either hair or skin products it may work for some people and won&#x27;t for others. I have been using it for almost a month now and I can see a difference in my hair. It is growing stronger and healthier. I have seen a lot of others shampoos that claim the same but they come and go. The proof with Shampoo Cre C is that it has been around for 5 years and still selling.</li>
    <li> Shampoo  Cre C Max works for my. It  works after I use for two weeks, first my hair stop loose then after a month  I have tiny  new hair. I do not want to loose my hair I want to just keep it and this shampoo do we work.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t regrow hair at all.  But it is a nice shampoo and makes your hair feel thicker.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible!! After only three uses my hair started falling out in clumps and after two weeks it hasn&#x27;t stopped so I discontinued using it. If you want a product that works, try biotin and viviscal combination. Guaranteed to work. My hair has bounced back and little to no loss and my baby hairs grew and my hair is fuller and longer! Takes six months for the therapy to completely work but you will notice differences in a month then three and finally complete in six. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I picked one because not option  to choose zero stars I  think my hair has not improved at all, the product is too strong for me and I feel like my hair brush bristles. Maybe for other costumers will be good</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. It turns my fine, soft hair into a complete rats nest that i had to re-wash and condition in order to get a brush through it. I used it with the cre-c conditioner as recommended. I would say the quality is down there with pert shampoo. The shampoo is slightly thicker water, very runny.</li>
    <li> VERY watery.... poured some on my hand and it was like pouring silky water.... It had no texture and was not soapy at all.... Had a funky smell to it as well... I did not use this product on my hair.... It went straight to the trash!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo a little. watery but does. a great job by giving full body to my hair. I will keep ordering. Gracias Cre-C!!</li>
    <li> While this shampoo has made my scalp healthier, no doubt, my hair loss has continued in the same manner. If you are losing hair on the top of your head, there&#x27;s no safe solution, not rogaine, not any shampoo, not any laser: only getting hair transplant surgery, or going the dangerous route with extreme powerful doses of minoxidil (you need a prescription for it) or taking pills with side effects. I used the shampoo daily for over 3 months and only noticed a healthier looking and feeling scalp, which is good, but doesnt give me any hair back.</li>
    <li> I thank you and God for this special blessing for us who are in need these good products that help us in life, 3Jn.2</li>
    <li> them promised me a second item for free. lied. only took 50% off my total. total waste of time. AND  the product does not really work.</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s great product love it work it or not I will buy it again</li>
    <li> This shampoo did nothing for me!</li>
    <li> It is hard to accept that the world is full deceptions in many areas of our lives. Many products ads bombard us and it is hard to determine what&#x27;s really good. In some cases the products are good and may not work for a certain human beings. I am currently in my 20s and I noticed my hair starting to fall when i was 17. I tried many things and even got a discount in one of my demartologist visit since they didn&#x27;t have an answer for it. \\&quot;Its part of nature\\&quot; they told me. I started to adapt and even felt more hair loss along the years as i went to college. About 2 years ago i decided to risk it with Shampoo Cre-C and guess what? it works!. I started to notice that the rate of loss was becoming less and less until no hair was falling. After a few weeks I noticed in the mirror that some bits of hair was actually growing in areas where it was declared as blank \\&quot;spots\\&quot;. Although is a great product there is something I dislike but at the same time I go along with it. It seems to work as long as you always use it. In other words you can&#x27;t stay long time without using it because the symptoms will come back. The shampoo seems not to help to cure the root of the problem but helps with the symptoms (honestly i don&#x27;t blame them hair loss is complex, I feel worse symtomps when stressed). I use it almost everyday. Obviously too much washing dries your scalp. I recommend for anyone to start using it when the hair is starting to fall and not to wait until the scalp loses the ability to grow hair because I think certain cells will die. I believe the product warns you about this. They mention that as long as those cells are alive although there&#x27;s not hair being shown, the hair will grow and the present one will not fall. Please don&#x27;t think that the whole head will be filled with hair by using the first bottle and don&#x27;t think that it will make miracles for severe cases. In other words if you still have plenty of hair and you have been losing enough to notice that you are going \\&quot;bald\\&quot;. Ibelieve this product will mark the difference and maybe people won&#x27;t even notice that you lost hair. I remember skipping for a few months and paid the concequences of feeling a rapid hair loss again. I started to be disciplined about it one more time and notice once more the difference and regret skipping its usage because today I believe I would have been with more hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is ok.  Nothing great, but I have to admit that using this natural ingredients got rid of dandruff.</li>
    <li> Good price and a reliable way to purchase thru Amazon. The product is authentic as shown on TV. I used it instead of using Rogaine Minoxidil.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is part of a treatment plan for professional results you need to purchase as part of a hair growth or restoration treatment plan.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are unnatural and are misrepresented. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the other comments. This is just an ordinary shampoo with chemicals.</li>
    <li> ive been using for five months following directions perfectly and no results only makes hair feel thicker a little definetly does not work i actually lost more hair using it u see ur hair folling out when u use it horrible dont get it ur better of using any other shampo</li>
    <li> This product worked for me.  After three uses I noticed less hair loss and gradually began seeing new hair growth! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working, but I have only used it for about 2 weeks, so it is too soon to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it seem to work, but on the long run it did nothing.</li>
    <li> I hate the Cre-C shampoo. I bought it, not expecting a miracle, but it didn&#x27;t even come close to helping me a little bit. I guess my expectations were too high or maybe the hype on this product was just too much? Either way, this shampoo sucks. Not only was it a waste of money, but I literally hated the way the shampoo felt in my hair and how my hair felt afterwards. I was better off shampooing with actual poo. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> I am 27 years old woman. Started losing my hair to the point that I could see patches and the famous \\&quot;horse shoe\\&quot; hairless line on my crown. I know, pretty scary. I didn&#x27;t know how bad things were until I noticed my husband and coworkers&#x27;s look of astonishment when looking at my hair. They couldn&#x27;t believe how bald I was becoming! I started panicking and finally decided to stop losing hair. Now, I have a syndrome call PCOS. PCOS are hormones not in balance, and you have to deal with male hair loss pattern. So, knowing how bad my situation is, I decided to buy pills and shampoo to battle the hair loss from both way. Inside and outside. Now, it&#x27;s been about a month since I started and OMG! First, my nails. Thanks to the pills, my nails are growing so fast and strong. I was never able to have a decent manicure because my nails were frail. Now, it&#x27;s amazing to feel them healthy and strong. And then, the most important, my hair. I wash my hair skipping a day. One day yes, one day no. So, after seeing about 200 hairs go through the drainer, last time I lost about 15 hairs. I don&#x27;t count how many hairs I lose, but I am trying to put the picture in your mind, so you can understand the improvement I&#x27;ve seen. Now, today I washed my hair and OMG! I lost about 8 hairs! Nothing compare to what I am use to. And also, I am now able to touch my hair and nothing comes through my fingers. All clear. I hope this review helps you decide to try this product if you are losing your hair like the way I was. Also, in conjunction with the shampoo I am taking the Maxi-Hair pills. So, in conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country Life Maxi Hair Maximized + Cre-C Shampoo + one month &#x3D; Hair stop falling, baby hairs growing, healthy nails, happy woman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000168G1S Country Life Maxi Hair Time Release, 90-Tablet]]</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but it does the job. This Shampoo is not a cure all for hair loss. But what it does is naturally condition your scalp and get rid of all the chemicals from regular soap. I have tried many, many hair shampoo&#x27;s and this is the only I know that actually grows and thickens your hair noticeably. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has used Shampoo Cre-C for about 3 weeks now and am able to see the difference in his hair.  Previously his hair had started thinning and hair line was fading also.  But now the hair has gotten thicker, the hair line has started to grow and the hair looks healthier.  He is definetly planning on buying this product over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo Cre-C really works!!!&lt;br /&gt;He is extremely satisfied!</li>
    <li> IF YOUR HAVING ISSUES WITH THINNING HAIR OR GOING BALD FORGET ABOUT EXPENSIVE  HAIR TRANSPLANT. CREC- MAX SHAMPOO WORKS , DONT HESISTATE ORDER IT NOW.</li>
    <li> awesome noticed some spots were gettin filled with hair it has also gotten stronger and darker i dont mind just grow baby grow.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so watery! It smells like pinsol and soap. I have no faith that this product makes hair grow. Save up your 12 bucks and buy a little more expensive shampoo. :)</li>
    <li> i was introduced to Mexican hair products during my last trip there, this is good shampoo.  kinda expensive, but worth every penny</li>
    <li> Fast in the arrive and in very good conditions. Right now not works for me but I need to following the treatment for more time, thats why i buy the package of the three products.</li>
    <li> Ive bought this item in mexico for about for about 30$ i didnt leave it on my hair 5 min, i left it overnight! My thick hair was thin of all the blade cutting into layers and it wud fall! &amp; it grew back after the whole bottle really thick, my hair still falls when i comb it after 5 years but it grows again! And my hair is long and beautiful(: &amp; thats cuz i only bought this product once</li>
    <li> JUST STARTED USING IT AND SO FAR AFTER ABOUT TWO WEEKS I STARTED SEEING SOME RESULTS. IWILL KEEP USING IT UNTILL I STAET SEEING SOME DRAMATIC RESULTS.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve been using this product for the last year may be, and it really works. this products reduce problem and give me a healthy hair again.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me or my daughter. I do not recommend it. You&#x27;ll be wasting your money. Warning.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I try this product</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s good shampoo although I have used several bottles and do not see any difference as far as re-growing hair. You can get something that cleans your hair just as well for less money I think.</li>
    <li> Makes hair soft but ive used one bottle and its been about 1.5 months and ive seen no change in hair growth</li>
    <li> This product has worked for me.  In using 1/2 of the bottle, my daughter says there are small hair particles that are growing at the crown of my scalp.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after the two bottles I purchased on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My sister saw results with this shampoo, I didnt. Very expensive and the bottle has enough shampoo for a few washes.</li>
    <li> The product is slightly different to the one from its country of origin.</li>
    <li> Good shipping good item and is working good at the moment i hope that this product work that i want past 90 days thanyou</li>
    <li> the product shipped in good timing. when I received the product it did not have the seal underneath the cap. another flag for me is this product smells like pinesol instead of lemons.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair thick.  I&#x27;m not sold on the fact that it doesn&#x27;t aid in the gradual removing of color in my hair...but it does make my hair thicker.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping to recover my lost hair in the front of head. It didn&#x27;t work a bit. Instructions to use it are poor. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Well, I have thinning hair and it doesn&#x27;t grow more hair but it does make what you have stand on end!! I look like a Brillo pad attacked my head. It is just as stiff as it can be.. So yes it looks thicker in a odd sort of way.</li>
    <li> I order this for me &amp; my daughter i&#x27;ve been usi.g it for 3 weeks now &amp; my hair is not falling as much as it use to it is working because it falling half of what it was before.
