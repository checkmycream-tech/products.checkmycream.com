      <li>There is, as with anything, better options for more money.</li>
      <li>This item came before it was expected which is awesome..</li>
      <li>when i received the package it smelled really strong</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly &amp; works!</li>
      <li>I used this to do my nails and filled them twice.</li>
      <li>Works great, makes acrylic nails last longer.</li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t have a fan nearby to cool my hands</li>
      <li>I always redo my nails every Sunday and no lifting for the whole week :) and it did not burn at all</li>
      <li>Well I received it quickly, but was blown away by the smell as soon as I opened the box.</li>
      <li>Got it, and it came so quickly.</li>
      <li>This came quickly and was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>I really feel like the primer is key in getting a good hold with the acrylic.</li>
      <li>So far, this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>other than that the product was good</li>
      <li>Very strong smell which gave me an instant headache.</li>
      <li>I feel like its too much of an HASSEL to contact the seller then contact Amazon all for $6.98!</li>
      <li>I definitely will buy more when needed.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll funny story it was frozen when I received it  </li>
      <li>I would buy it again once I finish this one first</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more of this.</li>
      <li>Primer in general is a must-have for applying strongly bonded acrylics/gels.</li>
      <li>I always use it when doing a fresh new set or when I do a fill.</li>
      <li>It does have a really strong smell to it, so recommend you use it in an open space.</li>
      <li>oh and it came REALLY fast</li>
      <li>shipping however was fast</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Well shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>It shipped fast and I like that it was wrapped in plastic so there was no leakage</li>
      <li>Packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t make my nails lift which is the whole purpose of it.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>On the plus side I didn&#x27;t receive it fast</li>
      <li>I ordered nail primer, shiiping was fast, it took like 3 daus to come, but i got acrilyc liquid for acrylic nail.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected and came very quickly.</li>
      <li>I will recommend a stronger primer Such as NSI super bond.</li>
      <li>I should have known better to purchase an acid free primer for my sensitve and thin nail beds.</li>
      <li>I purchased this primer along with the polymer and monomer and they are a wonderful alternative to the tiny expensive products in Sally&#x27;s and online.  </li>
      <li>An okay primer, it seemed to hold my acrylic really well, but it does burn if you file your nail too hard at first.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind it because I have a high post for pain.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is normally sealed</li>
      <li>I did receive it pretty fast with standard shipping.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it so small, but that&#x27;s my fault because I didn&#x27;t know exactly what .25 ounces were, but overall it&#x27;s a good brand, and I&#x27;ll be sure to order again, just not as small!</li>
      <li>This product works fine with the other items I purchased for my nail care.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t as strong as some other products that have been used on me before!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know a lot about primers, as I am new to using gel nails.  </li>
      <li>Stinks more than most primers</li>
      <li>So I recommend do not touch anything near your face!</li>
      <li>SO FAR!</li>
      <li>No lifting issues so far!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item was as indicated however wasn&#x27;t sealed.  I don&#x27;t know if it is normally sealed but I would have assumed to prevent leaking. I did receive it pretty fast with standard shipping.</li>
    <li> Great primer leaves my fake nails on for weeks!</li>
    <li> Was excited about this, but it has a terrible smell and burns my skin like crazy!!!</li>
    <li> This nail primer works really great and has lasted me a good while. It does have a really strong smell to it, so recommend you use it in an open space. It&#x27;s a great product for an even better price.</li>
    <li> the bottle is really small and this smellls SOOOO bad but it works so its all good .. oh and it came REALLY fast like it only took 3 days to get to mee so im really happy about that too</li>
    <li> hurts if you just pushed down the cuticle</li>
    <li> This is a great product! The smell isn&#x27;t as strong as some other products that have been used on me before! I recommend this entirely! No lifting issues so far!  Edit: so I read some of the negative reviews saying it smells horrible and burns skin. Yes it has a smell but it&#x27;s not as bad as I have dealt with in the past. As for the burning, it is nail primer! Primer will eat through the skin and It will burn if it gets on your skin. So if there are any people wanting to try to do it on yourself for the first time, apply carefully.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product.  Works like it should.</li>
    <li> I will give it a 5 star I love it. I am learning to do nails and this will be perfect.</li>
    <li> Packaged well and shipped fast. My fav brand an works well! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> works well but smells bad.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Happy to have found it for a good price and very excited to start using it for my acrylics.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I don&#x27;t know a lot about primers, as I am new to using gel nails.  I had acrylic tips for years.  I took them off and am letting my natural nail grow and using gel polish.  I like it, and the primer helps adhere the polish to the nail better then not using it.</li>
    <li> I ordered nail primer, shiiping was fast, it took like 3 daus to come, but i got acrilyc liquid for acrylic nail. I am so dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Lifting in days. Had to do nails at least once a week.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll funny story it was frozen when I received it  and I thought it was ruined but it thawed out and works well. Had a few nails come off in full though.</li>
    <li> the biggest thing they didn&#x27;t warn you about is the horrible smell it has, but i think its pretty descent.</li>
    <li> When used with the rest of product line  it is great products.&lt;br /&gt;Not a harsh smell. Takes a moment longer to &amp;#34;tacky Up&amp;#34; and hold is great!</li>
    <li> I wish i can give it a 0 start rate... It was so horrible, when i receive mine it was dry and couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong it stink.And it do not work like it say it do.ITS A WASTE OF MONEY!!! I do not know why its called supernail</li>
    <li> When I received this item it looked like the sender tried to tape the lid on and so by the time it got to my it was spilled all over the bag.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just regular staff. The best I could find for that price. It&#x27;s burning pretty much and sticks a little</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think .25 was not enough, but it actually is. Good product and I would def recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected delivery&lt;br /&gt;Its a nice primer works good</li>
    <li> I purchased this primer to use with the Supernail Acrylic system. I usually prefer two coats of primer as I am always prone to lifting, but this BURNED too much for me to apply a second coat. If I didn&#x27;t have a fan nearby to cool my hands I would have been running to the sink to rinse in cold water. This is not Supernail&#x27;s fault, and it did stop lifting which is why I still gave 4 stars. I should have known better to purchase an acid free primer for my sensitve and thin nail beds. Not sure if I will be using this again in 2 weeks for my fill, but I would like to considering I have the matching powder and liquid. Know your nail beds and choose and gentler primer if you are like me!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. I have not had lifting issues before but this primer lifts very badly on me I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> It came within the dates promised. The 4 stars is for the product being what it&#x27;s supposed to be for the price. There is, as with anything, better options for more money. But there is nothing wrong with this product. It is perfect for me being a beginner and teaching myself to do acrylics. Primer in general is a must-have for applying strongly bonded acrylics/gels.</li>
    <li> Very sticky &amp; stinks so bad &amp; the brush and bottle are very little! Disappointing . Waste of my money .</li>
    <li> I purchased this primer along with the polymer and monomer and they are a wonderful alternative to the tiny expensive products in Sally&#x27;s and online.  No yellowing, no lifting and great strength!  Buy them all!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I always use it when doing a fresh new set or when I do a fill. Works great, it does have a very strong smell so I suggest to wear a mask when using this product.</li>
    <li> Well shipping was fast. But the product was all over outside of box. Very strong smell which gave me an instant headache. I don&#x27;t even get a headache from being in the nail salon sooo idk.</li>
    <li> even with cheep acrylic stuff... the primer works awesome and nail are not lifting at all.... my favorit from now on</li>
    <li> nessesary. you do need this product to keep the acrylics on longer and it even feels more cleaner when i use this product.</li>
    <li> This product works fine with the other items I purchased for my nail care.</li>
    <li> Like the product. Works very well. Will buy more soon</li>
    <li> Arrived on time ... Frozen .. But dethawed after a few hours ... it is as stated STINKY ... BUT its a nail product what do you expect .. I have not been able to use it with my Acrylic yet as im still awaiting its arrival .. But once it arrives I shall definitaley update my review and let everyone know if it worked better.</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of primes in the past and this would be the only one  I WOULD BUY AGAIN!  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 because the packaging was horrible it had leaked in the box and smells very bad but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This item came before it was expected which is awesome.. BUT CONTENT WAS HARD AS A ROCK &amp; SMELLED LIKE CAT PEE NON usable I will NEVER buy with this distributor AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> I was having crazy lifting with my acrylic baize and gel nail sometimes the next day.  I always redo my nails every Sunday and no lifting for the whole week :) and it did not burn at all</li>
    <li> Great stuff it dose smell but not as bad as the acrylic liquid.</li>
    <li> This smells funky as hell but it doesn&#x27;t make my nails lift which is the whole purpose of it.  One time I accidentally touched my lip when the primer was still wet on my nail and it burned like holy hell I thought my lip had melted off my face. So I recommend do not touch anything near your face! Do not rub your eyes unless you don&#x27;t need them anymore</li>
    <li> Well I received it quickly, but was blown away by the smell as soon as I opened the box. It was an overpowering chemical smell. Can&#x27;t bring myself to use it since it smells so bad. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> An okay primer, it seemed to hold my acrylic really well, but it does burn if you file your nail too hard at first.  The smell is CRAZY strong, and disgusting.  It might of just been mine, because i&#x27;m baffled that other reviews say that it doesn&#x27;t smell.  Maybe it just needs time to set in room temp? Overall If you can look pass the smell and file correctly I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I give this product one star because, I received it FROZEN which is an act of nature but the worst part about it is that the brush was broken inside the bottle. There is no way possible I can use this on my clients. I can&#x27;t return it because Amazon doesn&#x27;t do returns on products that contains hazardous fluids, gases ect! I feel like its too much of an HASSEL to contact the seller then contact Amazon all for $6.98! On the plus side I didn&#x27;t receive it fast but there&#x27;s no way I can use it. You get what you pay for!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and came very quickly. Works as good as nail salon primer.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail primer I have found and I have tried many. Been using this one for years.</li>
    <li> got the product few day before the due date.. it work good but the smell is really bad as soon as I got it out the bag my hold room was smelling bad because of the product.. it work good but throw it in the trash because I cant keep it any where with out having the place smell bad..</li>
    <li> Just like the one used in salon. Acrylic haven&#x27;t lifted yet.</li>
    <li> Arrived in awesome time and works great! Thank you for a great product, I will reorder from you!!</li>
    <li> Great Product Came Right on time!</li>
    <li> When it arrived it had leaked all over the bag it came in and so there was only half of it left. Not to mention the product has a horrible overwhelming smell.</li>
    <li> I will recommend a stronger primer Such as NSI super bond. This primer did not last it started lifting 2 day later</li>
    <li> This is a primer nothing that makes my job easier but it is a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I only give it 3 stars because the bottle was just thrown in an mailing packet with no packaging around the bottle itself.&lt;br /&gt;so when i received the package it smelled really strong like the bottle had been leaking inside.&lt;br /&gt;the shipping however was fast</li>
    <li> I got it in before the date they gave me which was great but I hadn&#x27;t tooken it out of the bag they shipped it in and I could already smell it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very strong</li>
    <li> I got this really early and I&#x27;m so happy about it, it was a little frozen because it&#x27;s cold here, it works perfectly and the smell reminds me of the nail salon.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that when I received my primer it was spilled out so half of it was gone. other than that the product was good and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This primer did not give me any trouble, it did the its job well. I got it early in the mail also. I am only giving it 4 out of 5 stars because it burns and stings! I don&#x27;t mind it because I have a high post for pain. From a 1 to 10 (10 being the highest) the pain was about a 3.5 If you can&#x27;t handle stinging or burning on your nail beds don&#x27;t buy this. I know Amazon sells gentle, less painful primers. Look for those and buy them. Otherwise save a few dollars n buy this!</li>
    <li> I was in a pinch and decided to order this to get some primer in my shop before i would run of my usual brand of primer.  It is holding up well and the fumes are lighter than my brand. If I had not of order my usual brand I would switch. I will be switching once I am in need of primer again.</li>
    <li> I am someone who does my own nails from home (self taught). Because of this, I don&#x27;t really know which products are going to be the best. So far, this is my favorite. I did my nails three days ago and I don&#x27;t have even the slightest amount of lifting. With other products I have used, it is common for me to have to replace my nails after a week. I will definitely be ordering more of this.</li>
    <li> Works great, makes acrylic nails last longer.</li>
    <li> Im really happy with this item! I do recommend!..it works really good. I would buy it again once I finish this one first</li>
    <li> It shipped fast and I like that it was wrapped in plastic so there was no leakage but it does not give the hold you need or would want for your nails . . Most of my nails popped up.</li>
    <li> IT SMELLS GROSS ALMOST THREW UP BUT THE PRODUCT IS GOOD ITS SELF NO LIFTING SO FAR!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it so small, but that&#x27;s my fault because I didn&#x27;t know exactly what .25 ounces were, but overall it&#x27;s a good brand, and I&#x27;ll be sure to order again, just not as small!</li>
    <li> I never knew that this would help with the acrylic nails. When i bought a kit from a store it didn&#x27;t have this and oh my nail suffered for it. But now  I&#x27;m so glad that i use it now and know that my nails will look good.</li>
    <li> this really works before i was just using base and uv top coat on my uv gel nails and it was lifting in 3 to 4 days so far its been about a week and no lifting..</li>
    <li> This came quickly and was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started doing acrylics and I&#x27;m not 100% sure if my (acrylic) nails keep peeling off after like a day or two because my nails have a special type of oil, they&#x27;re the wrong consistency, the wrong acrylic, or this primer just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, use this item each time and I think it is doing its job.</li>
    <li> Very good product. As I expected.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly &amp; works! Make sure it&#x27;s used as directed. I&#x27;ve done my nails using this primer &amp; I have no lifting whatsoever. I definitely will buy more when needed. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Got it, and it came so quickly. Not even a week. Looking forward to see how good it works.</li>
    <li> Bonds well no lifting</li>
    <li> smells terrible and burned my skin</li>
    <li> Works great my nails finally stay on.</li>
    <li> I used this to do my nails and filled them twice. I really feel like the primer is key in getting a good hold with the acrylic.</li>
    <li> Stinks more than most primers</li>
    <li> i just wish to buy a LED lamp before buying the gel nails and primer. it has a weird smell to it but its fine</li>
