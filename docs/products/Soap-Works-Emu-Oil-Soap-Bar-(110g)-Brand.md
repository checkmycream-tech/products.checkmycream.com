<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> makes your skin smooth, and clean&lt;br /&gt;will buy again love it</li>
    <li> A very good product. This soap is an excellent cleanser and moisturizer.  This is the first time I tried emu oil soap and I was very pleased with the results.  I plan on ordering more of this soap.</li>
    <li> My skin looks great after two days of using.........it&#x27;s awesome and I love it</li>
    <li> I love this soap received on time and was very pleased with the packaging, my husband loves as well says it doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out.</li>
    <li> Great product, it working I feels my face and neck are tighter and make up go on so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;So glad that I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Very soothing.  We use it on hands and face and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use.  Feels like it&#x27;s doing good, although we couldn&#x27;t provide any objective proof.  We have some new surgical wounds that seem to benefit.</li>
    <li> Nice bar. Smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! After just a few days of using, it made my skin super soft.. I am always rubbing it! Love this product... blemishes and other ailments are also slowly going away.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it, but it&#x27;s really just so-so; not so different than soap in the stores for me.</li>
    <li> Its my main soap now.. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> and it&#x27;s ok. I noticed one little patch of eczema I had is gone and it lathers well. .but it also kinda leaves you skin with that \\&quot;tight-soap\\&quot; feeling. . especially if you&#x27;ve used Dove other soaps feel like \\&quot;soap.\\&quot;..but it was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> Love this soap....it feels so creamy and it doesn&#x27;t make me itch!  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of soaps, but this one is the BEST!</li>
    <li> soap works better then the emuaid max</li>
    <li> love it.  It does not dry ou tmy skin.  I will need to re-order.</li>
    <li> Used it along with the oil..didn&#x27;t experience the dryness most spoke of..left my face feeling clean unlike most soaps..</li>
    <li> I  like using the emu oil soap!</li>
    <li> I have purchased emu oil and thought I&#x27;d try the soap and I like it a lot.  It makes my skin smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have rosacia and was told that emu soap, oil and shampoos/conditioner were the ticket. I have only used this product about a week and it is still too soon to know. I do not itch and have been using less of the medicated lotions that were prescribed by the doctor. I think that it is definitely worth the try. The service was almost as good as promised.</li>
    <li> Very good item.  Meet all expectations.</li>
    <li> My wife liked it, but not enough to finish it; I&#x27;ll do that myself.</li>
    <li> DID NOT REALLY LIKE THE SOAP NO SCENT OR NOTHING</li>
    <li> I love the emu oils so I am trying this out on my face as a daily cleaner. So far its done great. No breakouts, I use the oil after I wash so my skin is clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I just bought this soap and found from the first time I used it, it left my skin soft and silky without being oily.&lt;br /&gt; my arms no longer have that dry flakey look. I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Its okay. It doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a tight feeling like some other soaps either. If you really want the moisturizing effects of emu oil I suggest just getting emu oil.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found a comparable soap to this Emu oil bar soap. I have sensitive dry skin and I am continually on the hunt for products which have non-toxic ingredients and have finally found what I was looking for in this soap. This soap leaves my skin clean and moisturized. I even use it on my dry scalp to calm and stop itching. This soap is so gentle I use it for my 2 year old&#x27;s shampoo and body wash. For the cost, no non-toxic ingredients and the results I haven&#x27;t found anything better after looking the majority of my life. I should mention now that it is winter I follow up with emu oil as a moisturizer and my skin no longer becomes dry and flaky after scratching even after a couple of days. I have since ordered the six pack and given a few out to friends and family to try and they too have had the same experience I have and said they will be ordering this soap for themselves.</li>
    <li> Item as described; Good communication; Fast delivery; Highly recommend*****</li>
    <li> have used for about a week.  I think its a good soap.  don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
    <li> Very good product, especially for sensitive skin.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the skin on my face feeling pinched or dried up.  Nice.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap, Its really moisturizing and I even used it to wash my hair! I also like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have the dryest, flakiest, patchiest skin on the PLANET!!!!! But Not Anymore! This review doesn&#x27;t even need to be long. I&#x27;ve never had a product make my skin soft and last longer than an hour until now. I still have some issues because I constantly pluck hairs from my face but this is the only soap that has not made my face tight and dry...it easily stays soft for a good two days straight (though I try to wash daily). I highly highly highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Not bad fior low price. Last long while and very gentle.</li>
    <li> I like the soap. It lathers well and cleans okay. My only complaint is I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent. They need to scent the bars of soap with a more pleasant scent. It doesn&#x27;t leave a scent on your hands after washing so I keep on using it.</li>
    <li> First time use, Dont know how to rate it yet.</li>
    <li> This soap is great! I bought it for my toddler, he has a mild eczema but its worse during the winter time.  This soap cleared up all his dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this soap for anyone suffering from eczema. it works!</li>
    <li> This Emu soap is wonderful ; it leave my skin so soft and smooth. I use it on my face, it keeps my face from becoming overly dry. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> We do recommend this to others.  My husband has very sensitive skin and this has been so good for him.  We had not seen the ads for the soap until we were looking on the computer.</li>
    <li> Love this bar soap. keeps your skin soft and not as dry.  I use if frequently and it&#x27;s about gone.probably won&#x27;t order on a regular basis because of price and bar soap is so available . Important thing it leaves your skin soft.</li>
    <li> This bar worked great for my hubby&#x27;s tinea versicolor, but it is pricey.  He used it everyday so it does not last very long but there were visible improvements in the texture of his skin in roughly two weeks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son who has problem skin.  He used it and really really liked it.  I will buy again for him.</li>
    <li> Just started using.  Not sure.</li>
    <li> I use this on my Blue Heeler and it is so nice.  Lathers quite nicely and is lasting much longer than I expected.  No perfume after bath smell but her fur stays fresh and clean in between baths.  I plan to order some for my own skin which suffers from sun poisioning.  Feeling very confident that it will help me as much as my dog.</li>
    <li> Great soap, I have bought this soap many times. Is a good Emu Oil soap.I got it from SoapWorks, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Wonderful…..lasts for-EVER  literally!</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjunction with the emu oil for my aunt&#x27;s super sensitive skin after her chemo and radiation treatments.</li>
    <li> Best skin soap I ever purchased! Second order have already been purchased! Fact that I split with my granddaughter,  who loves maybe more than I, definitely seen much improvement in her dry skin.</li>
    <li> PUT ME IN THE MIND OF OLD LYME SOAP, THINK IT WOULD CAUSE DRY SKIN PROBLEMS WITH PROLONGED USE.</li>
    <li> Love emu product, not a healer but a great reliever.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap. Of course its a process but it removes blemishes and even makes my face feel rejuvenated and clean. Highly Recommend if you want a reliable moisturizer.</li>
    <li> one bar lasts a while.  it is great for sensitive skin. You feel squeaky clean afterwards.  No film left on your skin. pleasant scent . it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry. great for my daughter who has eczema (it doesn&#x27;t cure it...it just doesn&#x27;t aggravate it or make it worse...it is soothing).</li>
    <li> BEST. SOAP. EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! Perfect for sensitive or irritated skin! I can&#x27;t say anymore. Just get this!</li>
    <li> I always buy all natural soap but this one makes your skin feel strap soft.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is it does not last very long. Well worth it though.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Used it immediately and feels great on my skin But three stars for the packaging ..was in soil brown paper bag with a sticker on the soap that was hard to remove because I didn&#x27;t see it before using</li>
    <li> Great for face and body</li>
    <li> Having a problem with exerma, I thought I would try this soap, I think it has helped along with emuaid...first time in two years my hand has looked so good.</li>
    <li> I have just finished one bar of emu soap out of my order of 5 bars. To be honest with you I have not noticed any particular benefits as apposed to most moisturizing soaps, however I will wait until I have used the remaining bars of emu soap before making my final judgement.</li>
    <li> Love it! Felt a different after the first time</li>
    <li> I got this to try for dry skin, but was a little too oily for me. Also the smell is a bit fishy.</li>
    <li> Love love this soap. It is very gentle and makes suds. It rinses off clean and skin feels soft. It really does not have much smell to it.  You can not smell on your skin at all. The bar seems to be lasting too.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> I am trying this soap as I have always liked the results of Emu Oil products. Time and use will tell, the results.</li>
    <li> Very good product. It leaves my face very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have had pain from a Shingles outbreak since October 2013.  The Emu oil Premium Golden helps, but it is greasy and it sometimes leaves my skin sensitive.  This Emu Oil Soap Bar is the best thing that I have found.  I wash the area that is still so painful, rubbing over it with a lot of lather until the soreness goes away, and the pain pretty much stays away for 4 or 5 hours.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap.  Smooth, supple skin results.  Love this.</li>
    <li> I loved this soap. I have used it all. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It seems to make my skin dryer and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> This is  will  be  my soap  ever, we love it</li>
    <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT IT HELPS MY MOM WITH LIKUS PLANTIS</li>
    <li> I will agree with other reviews about how it does not suds up very much or smell that good, however I can tell that it seals in moisture because when I use it, the water starts to bead up on my skin. I have started to look at buying a pump type emu soap.</li>
    <li> The emu soap is quite drying to the skin its not what I expected my skin had much more moisture to it before I used soap, I am not saying it will not work for other&#x27;s just not for me</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time.  My skin feels so soft after. I used to use aveeno which is also good but the bar melts too fast.  I also use emu oil after the face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Soap suds up nicely but a creamy foam appears.&lt;br /&gt;It last long too.  I use it nitely and still the bar has plenty left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will love it!</li>
    <li> Really have liked the Emu Oil for use after radiation treatments so thought I would try this.  I like it though and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film, which I like.</li>
    <li> I Really like this soap i wouldnt use it as a body soap but i didnt buy it for my body i bout it for my face it leaves you face with a clean feeling .... But i wanna know how much emu oil was used too make this</li>
    <li> I used this soap and it left my skin very soft.  But it did make my skin dry and flakey.  I know this sounds odd, but that is what happened. It is a nice soap, but I wanted something a bit more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> lathers well feels good on skin</li>
    <li> Emu oil is excellent in any form. This is another product with emu that I plan to continue to use. I mostly use it to wash my face which is saying a lot because I usually can&#x27;t use soap on my face due to sensitive skin. I only found 1 other soap emu and oatmeal combined that is as gentle. Unfortunately the emu oil producer stopped making soap although they have excellent emu products still.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described and quick delivery time</li>
    <li> I ordered on a Sunday and received it on a Wednesday! I use this product on my face as a cleanser and it usually leaves my skin very dry. I have used it for 3 days now and every time I use it, the same dry feeling. I continue to use it because I am anticipating some good results (but so far I do not notice anything). To combat the drying, I follow up with a oil based cleanser and then the emu oil (which is very moisturizing for my skin). If I do the oil based cleanser first, the emu oil soap will completely remove the oil and I am left with that, once again, dry skin. Overall, there is no smell and I will give it about a month to see true results as I am still in the beginning usage of this product.</li>
    <li> Love this soap and will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> EEEEWWWW! Emu Oil Soap Bar.  Made me feel sticky and unclean.  Defiantly not moisturizing nor Emollient.  I&#x27;m surprised too because I love the Olive Oil bar.</li>
    <li> Great softening healing soap, love it!</li>
    <li> Love it.I dont need to use lotion</li>
    <li> works like a miracle for my granddaughter&#x27;s acne, ad for my grandsn&#x27;s eczema. wll defintely ppurchase more of this soon.</li>
    <li> Product is very good, and I will be ordering some more of the soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this emu oil soap bar to try out and so far there is nothing to dislike; I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks. I use it as a body soap and then put on my body cream for dry skin.</li>
    <li> we are impressed.  my husband and i use it for different reasons and it seems to help us both.  he has seen some fading of his aging and old age crusty spots and I see improvement in my psoriasis.  Does not cure or eliminate anything but it is a really nice product and I will be buying more of it.</li>
    <li> this soap smell so good;i wish I had ordered more; definetly make your body feel smooth and silky; great buy</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for. My skin is dry and sensitive so I have to use soaps that accommodate my skin type so I was excited to see this advertised. My family had an Emu farm when I was young and we raised Emu but I never used any products that came from them. Here was my chance. The soap bar was packaged very well and didn&#x27;t have a bad small, which I was a little worried about. To me, it smells like one of those soaps you would use at a resort. The size is pretty close to an ordinary bar of soap. Maybe a tad smaller and it has a nice engraving on the top of the bar. However, when I washed my face with it, it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all and burned my eyes. In fact, I ended up having to go right behind and use my usual sensitive Dove bar of soap so my skin wouldn&#x27;t feel so dry. Yes, I use bar soap on my face. :) I will continue to use it but not on my face. For the price, I was disappointed. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have dry, sensitive skin and not normal. Hopefully this bar will work for those with normal skin type.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because I constantly fuss about how my face looks (...who doesn&#x27;t ?) ..and because I read about the great benefits of using Emu oil as a facial skin rejuvenator .&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this soap as I mentioned in the headline ,but not something to depend on for the long haul ?</li>
    <li> I use it on my face with my Clarisonic Mia. I am happy with the soap.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I thought I should give this soap a try and glad I did.  Typically I have allergy problems with the majority of soap products, but no issues with the Emu Soap at all.  Leaves your skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> Loved the way my skin felt after a shower.  My husband liked it too.  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;(4 stars is due to cost factor for me.)</li>
    <li> Really works on a removed meniscus</li>
    <li> I am a vanicream user and thought  I would try this....it leaves a film on my body I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel very soft and it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell to it.  would recommend to anyone with dry skin</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product. i wish i could get locally but i will be ordering more soon. i will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Good gentle wash for fragile skin!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - Thanks!</li>
    <li> caused a lot of break outs</li>
    <li> I buy that soap and also I have emu oil lotion which is \\&quot;Emu oil\\&quot; moisturising cream product made from Australia.. First, use soap to wash face and dry face then apply that cream. It sure help a bonus. Both work well on any type of skin. It makes my skin feel very soft and clear of redness, rashes and overworked skin.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with an emu</li>
    <li> Good soap; softens the skin without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Great shipping, and the product speaks for itslef after each and every use. Its the cheapest bar of emu soap they have and it does wonders to my skin, moisture, gets rid of any bumps, or rashes, my skin always get complimented on how silky if feels and how wonderful it looks and thats the only product i use on my body. Face, different story!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this more than I do, but she likes it quite a bit.  It does lather up well and washes off completely with no lingering residue.  It is very smooth and silky without any grittiness at all.  We use emu oil as well so it is hard to determine how good the soap is compared to the actual oil product, but as a bar soap it is very good and has no strong odor like some bar soaps.  Only issue we had with this product was the packaging, but the product itself is very good.</li>
    <li> the soap leaves my face clean and moisturized</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has problems with rashes on her chest and back.  She is ECSTATIC!!  This product works!  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I am a user of [[ASIN:B001DKGJQU PRO EMU OIL (8 oz) AEA Certified]] and wondered if the soap might also have any of the positive properties of Emu oil. It appears to indeed. Also, it produces a really good lather. I ride a bicycle year &#x27;round, so the outdoors dries my skin. This soap does a nice job of restoring some of my lost oils. My skin isn&#x27;t as dry and it feels wonderfully clean after a shower. I have already reordered this soap.</li>
    <li> Unscented natural soap that clenses and tightens pores while providing an excellent balance of moisture and shine to the skin.  Instantly gives the skin youth and radiance.</li>
    <li> Love it, has my skin smooth</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectation and I would order again.  Leaves your skin feeling beautiful with no soapy residue.  Use with the Emu oil fir a beautful glow!  :-)</li>
    <li> I purchased this &amp; the Pure Emu Oil for my husband; he has arthritis Psoriasis  - he is a bit hard headed and has not tried this product --- Well I have and it is great – I’ve been using the oil on my knuckle as the arthritis is sometime a bit much for me; for some wonderful reasons it brings relief &amp; flexibility to that area.  Not sure how or why the Emu Oil works as it does but Love it.  Wish the hard head would try it; he would be impressed as much as me I’m sure.</li>
    <li> Used to help reduce shingles on leg.  Not sure if it reduced length of time shingles were present, but it did help to keep skin soft.  Other uses are listed on wrapper, but this is what we used it for.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the emu oil &amp; am using both products for the first time.  I love the silky feel of the soap &amp; that it leaves the skin very moisturized, without feeling sticky or greasy.  I have used lotion after the shower for years, but do not need to now as the soap moisturizes very well on its own.</li>
    <li> Product received as described. Good buy.</li>
    <li> The soap was lightly fragrant and moisturizing. I was very pleased with it. However, I thought it was a little pricey. I can&#x27;t see myself paying that much for a bar of soap on a regular basis. It was a nice splurge.</li>
    <li> i realy like this bar of soap&lt;br /&gt;makes your skin sort and helps with drtness&lt;br /&gt;a very good price will get more</li>
    <li> I have used this soap a couple times and I have to say I am not impress.  The soap comes in a small ziplock bag, which is fine.  What annoyed me was the fact that the soap had a barcode sticker on the it. Why couldn&#x27;t they put the sticker on the bag. The sticker was not easy to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the reason that I gave this product a low rating is the fact, after showering my skin was drier than before washing with the soap. I brought this soap specifically to help me with my dry skin and it made my skin worse. Since I have a brown skin tone, you can tell right away when my skin becomes dry.  I am guessing that is not for everyone but for me, it not worth the money. I am hoping emu oil will work better.</li>
    <li> I have some recurring eczema. This is a wonderful soap. Smells great, softens skin.</li>
    <li> thank god for soap.  soap makes you feel,  make you smell good, and best of all it make you rest good.</li>
    <li> I use it for my hands and glad I did not try it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;My hands are now worse off than when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Took out the moisture. Soap and emul oil not a good combo.&lt;br /&gt;If I had paid more for it I&#x27;d want my money back.&lt;br /&gt;Have to go back to my bottle of 100% emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;Now that&#x27;s a product worth getting.</li>
    <li> The soap is a skin softener, plus a dry skin moisturizer.  Don&#x27;t overlook this item along with Emu oil for your skin. It can stand alone, but why not back it up with the oil, cost effective, plus it works.  I purchased both items for my legs and feet.</li>
    <li> Taking chemo treatments. It appears to be helping with rash.</li>
    <li> This is the soap for you if you want a really CLEAN skin after a hard days job outside there where you are exposed to all kinds of germs and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves  your skin feeling clean and refreshed with every use. would definitely re-order again.</li>
    <li> Love Emu oil products.  Good for the skin.  Cleans with no residue and smells great even tho it&#x27;s doing a good job.</li>
    <li> If its not in a bar it aint soap I say.&lt;br /&gt;was trying to grow out the beard and developed awful dry patches with no relief for weeks. Substituted my normal irish spring for this. 3 nights n 3 good scrubs and I was near healed! Smell is unisex but g*dd*mn does it smell good! Id call it a universal scent as my gf loves it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> Great product. My face cleared up immediately.</li>
    <li> Loving this soap!  Leaves my skin smooth and I think it&#x27;s economical, considering I no longer have to use expensive lotions to try to replace the moisture stripped by other soaps.  This is great and my husband loves it too!</li>
    <li> quick delivery, smells great and the wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Love it, makes your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any results with this soap. I purchased this on my own. It was not a product review.</li>
    <li> My skin clear for the first time in my life. (I am in my 50s). My skin is softer and noticeably improved. My hands were cracked and dry. My son noticed the improvement after I used it for two days. I suffer allergy problems like hives and sebaceous cysts. They totally disappeared after a little more than a week&#x27;s worth of use. I highly recommend this product. Follow up with 100% Pure Emu Oil as a moisturizer for soft, smooth, blemish free skin. The oil is great for painful muscles and joints too.</li>
    <li> Did not help for skin rashes or fungus!</li>
    <li> This soap cleans well but does leave skin feeling dry and tight. I would probably not purchase again as a face wash.</li>
