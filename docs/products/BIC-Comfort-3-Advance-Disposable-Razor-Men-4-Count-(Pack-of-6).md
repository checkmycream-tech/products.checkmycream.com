### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is one of the best razors, disposable or otherwise, I have ever used.</li>
      <li>but these seem to strike the best balance of performance and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve discovered that the BIC COMFORT 3 ADVANCE PIVOT TRIPLE BLADE RAZOR is one of the best razors to use.  </li>
      <li>These blades were Great!</li>
      <li>,that&#x27;s my favorite razor!!!</li>
      <li>A very good shaver.</li>
      <li>The shave is comparable in closeness to a Gillette Good News!</li>
      <li>If you want to try a Bic razor go for the Flex 3, it&#x27;s a great razor comparable with the Mach 3.</li>
      <li>Great blades, disposable.</li>
      <li>Based on my experience, this razor is good for about seven to twelve days depending on the density of one&#x27;s hair and the frequency of shaving.</li>
      <li>They just look and feel cheaper now, but just shave just as good.</li>
      <li>I bought these just to give Bic a chance, and see if they make razors as good as some of their pens.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Overall, the BIC Comfort 3 Advance is a very good razor from BIC and it ranks as the best disposable BIC razor I have tried thus far.</li>
      <li>Avoid at all costs for your own good.</li>
      <li>The sound is good, great even.</li>
      <li>They are as good or better than the originals.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Concluding...buy this razor at your own risk.</li>
      <li>I have a very nice electric razor that I enjoy using and can shave in a quarter of the time it takes me to shave using a disposable.  </li>
      <li>The photo shows the real original BIC Advance razors.</li>
      <li>This is the best razor I have found for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The substantial contoured handle fits very comfortably in my grip.  </li>
      <li>In a pinch, this wonderful device can double as a wungel.</li>
      <li>as you shriek, excellent mid-range as you moan, and deep growls of exhaustion as you exsanguinate, flopping like a dying halibut on your bathroom floor.  </li>
      <li>When I shave, I am most picky about the moustache area</li>
      <li>and I tend to shave it more rigorously.</li>
      <li>Avoid at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 3 stars.</li>
      <li>This will sound like a commercial - but these have been the best shave ever.</li>
      <li>They are the smoothest shave ever and have a nice big easy grip, non slippery handle that is great for in the shower.</li>
      <li>My personal recommendation is the Gillette Good News!</li>
      <li>I bought these at CVS on sale,even at the cut rate price,these dont work that great for me,I do have a heaveier beard than most,but the Gillette Fusion always gives a great shave,even thick ones like mine</li>
      <li>This is one part of the razor, however, that wears out more quickly than the rest.</li>
      <li>Love this product so much!!  </li>
      <li>They are also a great value, costing about one third of comparable razors.</li>
      <li>You end up with a cheap looking knockoff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I shave both my scalp and face daily, and this razor provides a great, close shave, the pivoting head manoeuvering the contours of my head and face with minimum effort.  </li>
      <li>It gives me a smooth and close shave.</li>
      <li>and now the shaves are not as smooth.</li>
      <li>bought Comfort 3 for years now and very rarely would I cut myself.  </li>
      <li>However, I really liked the end result and highly recommend using it for a comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>They rinse ok, but you will still clog it up if you get over ambitious.</li>
      <li>This is overall the most effective and comfortable razor I&#x27;ve used -- disposable or electric.</li>
      <li>This razor maintains its fine edge for at least 2 weeks..and is even excellent after the lubricant strip is dissolved away.</li>
      <li>excellent being of large size with a rubbery texture that keeps it from slipping in your hand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these razors to shave my head for the last year and they do a good job.</li>
      <li>I shave once every day so with this razor, I can expect to get through one full month with about three or four razors.</li>
      <li>I shave once every day so with this razor, I can expect to get through one full month with about three or four razors.</li>
      <li>The raised \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; (for lack of a better word) offer a gripping surface and they are placed in several strategic places on the handle.</li>
      <li>The raised \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; (for lack of a better word) offer a gripping surface and they are placed in several strategic places on the handle.</li>
      <li>They leave a trail of moisture on the skin that is slippery to the touch but washes off quickly with water.</li>
      <li>It offers a very smooth and clean shave</li>
      <li>The wider bottom fits nicely into the palm of the hand while the narrow middle is good for gripping between the fingers.</li>
      <li>The wider bottom fits nicely into the palm of the hand while the narrow middle is good for gripping between the fingers.</li>
      <li>I got a free sample of this razor in a goody bag from a half marathon and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you have decent health coverage if you live in the States!!!</li>
      <li>After about four uses, I could feel a distinct difference in the amount of lubricant that was released from these strips.</li>
      <li>but when it comes to disposable razors, the added cost is worth it.</li>
      <li>This design is a good one and it ranks with some of the better, more expensive disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This design is a good one and it ranks with some of the better, more expensive disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Never before have I had this kind of negative result with a razor of any kind.</li>
      <li>but when it comes to disposable razors, the added cost is worth it.</li>
      <li>If you take the dive and try these things, you better do some serious face preparation -- I&#x27;m talking hot shower, great shave cream, maybe a couple days worth of facial hair so that it&#x27;s softened up some more</li>
      <li>Your mileage may vary, and I do add this caveat: the right tool for the right job.  </li>
      <li>I first encountered these razors when I received one in my complimentary toiletry pack on a cruise ship four or five years ago, and I have used nothing else since.  </li>
      <li>A cheap, inexpensive razor isn&#x27;t likely to result in a comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>I was THRILLED to find them on AMAZON and at such a reasonable price as well.</li>
      <li>Like I said these Bic Comfort 3 Advance razors hurt even on the first shave,</li>
      <li>Crisp highs</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see this thing lasting beyond one, maybe two, shaves at the most.</li>
      <li>Initially I hesitated to purchase these because the price came to about $1.21 per razor, which didn&#x27;t seem much better than what I could get at the grocery store.  </li>
      <li>It outperforms generic wungels, but if you want a better one, go for the upgrade.</li>
      <li>I was only able to use these razors two to three times each because of how infrequent I rely upon a disposable razor in shaving.  </li>
      <li>I have had difficulty finding these razors on stores in my local area, but I can always count on Amazon to come through when I need more.</li>
      <li>I live in Kauai and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores I frequent...</li>
      <li>This brought the average price per razor down to around 80 cents, which I felt was a great deal for a quality product!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The sliminess of the aloe and Vitamin E makes it feel like the shave was closer than it really was.</li>
      <li>The sliminess of the aloe and Vitamin E makes it feel like the shave was closer than it really was.</li>
      <li>Exactly as expected, good price and so much easier than trying to depend on &amp;#34;hit or miss&amp;#34; stock at local stores.</li>
      <li>You can get much better deals, and much closer shaves, with other 2-blade disposables from Gillette and Schick.</li>
      <li>The color is a nice cool blue, minty even (disregarding the notion that minty calls up associations of green pine trees and Christmas m&amp;ms.)</li>
      <li>But today, I invest more time and money on shaving and other health care products.</li>
      <li>The price per razor is almost greater than BIC&#x27;s other varieties</li>
      <li>The price per razor is almost greater than BIC&#x27;s other varieties</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gonna stick to my tried and true Gillette Fusion or possibly Schick Quatro!!!</li>
      <li>Classic bait and switch.    </li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>BIC has replaced the soft and comfortable gel-like handle on these to cheap hard plastic</li>
      <li>For a disposable, it actually looks pretty decent.</li>
      <li>The Gillette Sensor3 disposables, as well as the new Schick Quattro disposables, both come to mind.</li>
      <li>With these knock-offs using even a fresh blade and gentle &amp; careful use</li>
      <li>Better grip, efficient cutting, and improved comfort make this one of the better disposable razors on the market.</li>
      <li>Better grip, efficient cutting, and improved comfort make this one of the better disposable razors on the market.s.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d normally opt for the 10 Watt speakers, but even sans amplification, the rasps and cuts come through clear as a bell.</li>
      <li>No, but they don&#x27;t hack your face up and last pretty well.</li>
      <li>However, there are times, such as during the Christmas season, when I don&#x27;t shave for several days and have a healthy growth of facial hair.  </li>
      <li>I never cut myself more than once usually, but I cut my face probably 10 times, maybe 15 with this razor.</li>
      <li>They last a long time and feel comfortable in the hand.  </li>
      <li>After a very long search trying many razor brands and types, for some reason this one gives minimal irritation.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Proof that we&#x27;re still recovering from a recession.  I buy these in stores all the time and loved them -- received my order from amazon today and I&#x27;m very disappointed.    BIC has replaced the soft and comfortable gel-like handle on these to cheap hard plastic you&#x27;d likely find on a pack of disposable razors from a dollar store.  They&#x27;ve obviously cut the quality and a lot of the material from the handles to save on material and manufacturing costs.    From what I can tell the blade cartridge may be the same but the neck is much wider, preventing me from hanging it from my razor hanger in my shower.    I wonder if this applies to all their Comfort 3 retail packs or just the razors in the bulk packs on Amazon.  Classic bait and switch.    UPDATE (Sep 2011): The razor blade is definitely sub-par quality compared to the Comfort 3 shavers found in stores.  I have been using the store bought Comfort 3 for years now and very rarely would I cut myself.  With these knock-offs using even a fresh blade and gentle &amp; careful use I end up with several nicks and cuts.    I&#x27;ll be posting up comparison pics as soon as I get a real pack from a local store.</li>
    <li> Works for my beard.  They&#x27;re all expensive... but these seem to strike the best balance of performance and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I first encountered these razors when I received one in my complimentary toiletry pack on a cruise ship four or five years ago, and I have used nothing else since.  I shave both my scalp and face daily, and this razor provides a great, close shave, the pivoting head manoeuvering the contours of my head and face with minimum effort.  The substantial contoured handle fits very comfortably in my grip.  This is overall the most effective and comfortable razor I&#x27;ve used -- disposable or electric.</li>
    <li> Knowing that razors are super expensive, I&#x27;ve been keeping my eye out for deals lately so my family can stock up and save a little money.  Initially I hesitated to purchase these because the price came to about $1.21 per razor, which didn&#x27;t seem much better than what I could get at the grocery store.  I decided to go for it anyway and when I received the shipment, it turns out there are 6 packages with 6 razors in each, instead of the advertised 4 per pack (packaging says the +2 are a bonus).  This brought the average price per razor down to around 80 cents, which I felt was a great deal for a quality product!</li>
    <li> This razor is unusual to me because even after I have used it a few times, I continue to get constant cuts with it, especially on my neck.  My wife tried these on her legs and had the same problem.  I might throw the remaining razors away.</li>
    <li> This will sound like a commercial - but these have been the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have found for sensitive skin.  After a very long search trying many razor brands and types, for some reason this one gives minimal irritation.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this razor in a goody bag from a half marathon and loved it.  Looked off and on for them in stores and couldn&#x27;t find.  I was THRILLED to find them on AMAZON and at such a reasonable price as well. They are the smoothest shave ever and have a nice big easy grip, non slippery handle that is great for in the shower. Thanks</li>
    <li> I prefer these to the shavers sold as &#x27;women&#x27;s shavers&#x27;.  I find they get blunt much less quickly and somehow I don&#x27;t get nicked so often, either.  They last a long time and feel comfortable in the hand.  My husband and I both use these:  in his case they are a back-up to his electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use a disposable razor very often. I have a very nice electric razor that I enjoy using and can shave in a quarter of the time it takes me to shave using a disposable.  However, there are times, such as during the Christmas season, when I don&#x27;t shave for several days and have a healthy growth of facial hair.  After these times when I decide to shave again, my electric razor just won&#x27;t do and I have to resort to using a disposable razor.  I&#x27;ve discovered that the BIC COMFORT 3 ADVANCE PIVOT TRIPLE BLADE RAZOR is one of the best razors to use.  It offers a very smooth and clean shave and I hardly ever nick my face or chin when using one.  The razors have a lubrication strip of aloe and Vitamin E that adds some protection to the countenance and chin.  I was only able to use these razors two to three times each because of how infrequent I rely upon a disposable razor in shaving.  However, I really liked the end result and highly recommend using it for a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much!!  The color is a nice cool blue, minty even (disregarding the notion that minty calls up associations of green pine trees and Christmas m&amp;ms.) But if you concentrate hard enough, and go to your happy place, you can actually apply that, and mentally wish away some of the pain your face is now undergoing.  The sound is good, great even. Works with any iPod! I&#x27;d normally opt for the 10 Watt speakers, but even sans amplification, the rasps and cuts come through clear as a bell. Crisp highs as you shriek, excellent mid-range as you moan, and deep growls of exhaustion as you exsanguinate, flopping like a dying halibut on your bathroom floor.  In a pinch, this wonderful device can double as a wungel. I&#x27;m not going to bother finding out what one is or does, but it serves almost the same purpose. It outperforms generic wungels, but if you want a better one, go for the upgrade. Your mileage may vary, and I do add this caveat: the right tool for the right job.  I cannot say enough about the aerodynamics!!! Why - lack of interest. Never tested the melting point either. But if you drill holes in it you still won&#x27;t have a passable flute.  Buy this product now! Make sure you have decent health coverage if you live in the States!!!</li>
    <li> I use disposable razors almost exclusively and they are one of a group of products where price and quality are directly correlated to each other. A cheap, inexpensive razor isn&#x27;t likely to result in a comfortable shave. In my younger days, I would often reach for the cheaper varieties out of financial necessity. But today, I invest more time and money on shaving and other health care products. BIC Comfort 3 Advance is BIC&#x27;s most expensive razor and it does rank a notch better than the other, more expensive members of the BIC family and several notches better than BIC&#x27;s cheapest razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging by the ability to cut hair, this razor seems like a pretty good one. The cutting device offers three blades that get the job done in the most efficient manner possible. Each stroke sends three blades across the surface of your skin, cutting the hair more quickly and with less effort than other disposable razors. I did experience an occasional small cut (usually above my upper lip), but this is common with almost all hand operated razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lubrication strips just above the blades offer extra protection by moisturizing the skin before the blades make contact. These strips release aloe and Vitamin E and you can feel them working with each stroke across your face. They leave a trail of moisture on the skin that is slippery to the touch but washes off quickly with water. This is one part of the razor, however, that wears out more quickly than the rest. After about four uses, I could feel a distinct difference in the amount of lubricant that was released from these strips. There was practically nothing left and their enhancement to the shaving experience was minimal. Also, since they do leave the skin feeling rather slimy, they make it more difficult to check for a close shave. When I shave, I am most picky about the moustache area and I tend to shave it more rigorously. I even turn the razor around and shave against the growth of the hair for added closeness. I always rub my fingers across the skin to check for closeness but this process is interfered with lubrication is present. The sliminess of the aloe and Vitamin E makes it feel like the shave was closer than it really was. This is why you must remember to wipe off the slimy lubricant before you administer the touch test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle of BIC Comfort 3 Advance is designed to make shaving easier. The wider bottom fits nicely into the palm of the hand while the narrow middle is good for gripping between the fingers. The raised \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; (for lack of a better word) offer a gripping surface and they are placed in several strategic places on the handle. This design is a good one and it ranks with some of the better, more expensive disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIC Comfort 3 Advance is just like other disposable razors in at least one regard: It has to be thrown away in about one to two weeks. Based on my experience, this razor is good for about seven to twelve days depending on the density of one&#x27;s hair and the frequency of shaving. I shave once every day so with this razor, I can expect to get through one full month with about three or four razors. This is a little bit better than other disposable razors and it helps to partially justify the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the BIC Comfort 3 Advance is a very good razor from BIC and it ranks as the best disposable BIC razor I have tried thus far. The price per razor is almost greater than BIC&#x27;s other varieties but when it comes to disposable razors, the added cost is worth it. Better grip, efficient cutting, and improved comfort make this one of the better disposable razors on the market.s.

    <li> This is one of the best razors, disposable or otherwise, I have ever used. I also like the Schick. This razor maintains its fine edge for at least 2 weeks..and is even excellent after the lubricant strip is dissolved away. The handle feel is excellent being of large size with a rubbery texture that keeps it from slipping in your hand. I live in Kauai and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores I frequent...therefore, I had to order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a complete piece of junk. Avoid at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 3 stars. For a disposable, it actually looks pretty decent. Recently, however, there have been new disposable razors which are just as aesthetically pleasing. The Gillette Sensor3 disposables, as well as the new Schick Quattro disposables, both come to mind. It&#x27;s definitely the best-looking Bic ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave: 1 star. Ouch. Incredibly painful. I bought these just to give Bic a chance, and see if they make razors as good as some of their pens. The conclusion: they should stick to pens. Not only was it not close (considering it&#x27;s got 3 blades), but it cut my face to absolute shreds. Never before have I had this kind of negative result with a razor of any kind. Sure, I get the occasional nick with just about any razor, but this was so bad I was almost embarrassed to go out in public in the hours after my shave. The shave is comparable in closeness to a Gillette Good News! disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: 1 star. I can&#x27;t see this thing lasting beyond one, maybe two, shaves at the most. If you take the dive and try these things, you better do some serious face preparation -- I&#x27;m talking hot shower, great shave cream, maybe a couple days worth of facial hair so that it&#x27;s softened up some more...just be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concluding...buy this razor at your own risk. You can get much better deals, and much closer shaves, with other 2-blade disposables from Gillette and Schick. My personal recommendation is the Gillette Good News! disposable.</li>
    <li> Great blades, disposable. A very good shaver. Small blade head helps with the straight cut at the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Got nothing against Bic,stick to making pens and lighters!!! I bought these at CVS on sale,even at the cut rate price,these dont work that great for me,I do have a heaveier beard than most,but the Gillette Fusion always gives a great shave,even thick ones like mine,that&#x27;s my favorite razor!!! Like I said these Bic Comfort 3 Advance razors hurt even on the first shave,Ouch!!!,sorry, dont wanna bleed,thank you!!! I&#x27;m gonna stick to my tried and true Gillette Fusion or possibly Schick Quatro!!! Not recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected, good price and so much easier than trying to depend on &amp;#34;hit or miss&amp;#34; stock at local stores.</li>
    <li> Probably the worst razor I have used in my life, no exaggeration. Avoid at all costs for your own good. I&#x27;m sitting here with a burning face that&#x27;s cut to pieces and had to come online to vent my anger, hah. I never cut myself more than once usually, but I cut my face probably 10 times, maybe 15 with this razor. If you want to try a Bic razor go for the Flex 3, it&#x27;s a great razor comparable with the Mach 3. This thing is horrible. Huge thumbs down!</li>
    <li> I have had difficulty finding these razors on stores in my local area, but I can always count on Amazon to come through when I need more. I have been using this particular brand for the past six years, and plan to continue as long as they are available.</li>
    <li> The lubricating bars are different than the one I have had in the&lt;br /&gt;past and now the shaves are not as smooth. The darker blue bar&lt;br /&gt;is now on the top where on the ones I have used in the past it is on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The white bars are also reversed.</li>
    <li> As far as DISPOSABLE razors go, these are a 4 star. Can they compete with a Mach 3/Fusion/whatever? No, but they don&#x27;t hack your face up and last pretty well. They rinse ok, but you will still clog it up if you get over ambitious.</li>
    <li> These have been the dullest razors I have ever used.  They hurt my face going with the grain and almost made me yelp from the razor pulling at my hair</li>
    <li> Bought a pack of these because I had a coupon and because I&#x27;m tired of paying such a high price for Schick Hydro refills. During the very first use I could feel the blades cutting my face, and despite that the shave isn&#x27;t that close. It was so bad there were blood stained water droplets on the side of the tub as I was getting out of the shower. I had to put a cold wet cloth on my neck to relieve the pain. Bic has a \\&quot;satisfaction guarantee\\&quot; but you&#x27;ll have to mail them to Bic (postage not refunded) and they&#x27;ll send you the same product back and $1 off Bic coupons equal to the price of the product.</li>
    <li> The photo shows the real original BIC Advance razors. What they send you is totally different. You end up with a cheap looking knockoff.&lt;br /&gt;They also do not provide the same shave.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: have been using them for over a month now. They are as good or better than the originals. I guess bic thinks they improved them. They just look and feel cheaper now, but just shave just as good.</li>
    <li> These blades were Great!</li>
    <li> I like this type of razor.  It gives me a smooth and close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these razors to shave my head for the last year and they do a good job. They are also a great value, costing about one third of comparable razors.</li>
