### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Unless you get the Q-Tips in there perfectly aligned, you have to struggle just to get any out.</li>
      <li>You have to get the q-tips in PERFECT inorder to keep them from falling out the front of the dispenser.</li>
      <li>If they are not lined up PERFECT they just spill out everywhere.</li>
      <li>AND, if you do get them all stacked perfectly, they don&#x27;t stay that way.</li>
      <li>Not the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made</li>
      <li>This fits the bill perfectly.</li>
      <li>If you have 5-8 hours to perfectly align your q-tips so that the dispenser looks as pictured, knock yourself out.</li>
      <li>If I placed each one in separately and perfectly even then the qtips would no longer be sanitary.</li>
      <li>This is great!  </li>
      <li>does not matter if you line up each cotton swab by hand perfectly, as soon as you pull one out the others</li>
      <li>Awesome, would recommend.</li>

      <li>Still a good product, but not the greatest &amp;#34;dispenser&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I loved the idea of the Qube because I use a lot of q-tips, but this model isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
      <li>This is a good idea for a product, however, it takes a bit to get the q-tips out unless you can line them up PERFECTLY in this cube.</li>
      <li>the qube cottom swab dispenser is a great product.</li>
      <li>Looks great on the bathroom counter and all the kids can get QTips without digging in the box.</li>
      <li>Found-object artists and the obsessive will have a great time filling this dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>GREAT customer service.  </li>
      <li>The idea that you can fill this with cotton swabs &amp; grab one or two from the bottom is a great idea.</li>
      <li>Great idea.</li>
      <li>Great, item.  </li>
      <li>The idea was great.</li>
      <li>This dispenser is great for storing cotton swabs on the bathroom counter.  </li>
      <li>I still recommend it because it looks great.</li>
      <li>Am I happy with my purchase?  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been great.</li>
      <li>I was thinking this would be a great option for dispensing my cotton swabs.</li>
      <li>I got this thinking it would be great, until I tried to put Qtips in and get them out.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>it is inexpensive, Holds a good amount of Q-tips &amp; Looks great as a Plus.</li>
      <li>its very nice and look good as describ.</li>
      <li>I never quite got it to look that good.</li>
      <li>It looks good</li>
      <li>You will never get the fuzzy-headed swabs to align so perfectly horizontal that they just slip out the bottom like smooth, plastic straws (and also because they are not in fact frictionless products.)</li>
      <li>it was a good price and arrived on time.</li>
      <li>While this is a good product for storing your Q-Tips without having to keep the box</li>
      <li>Good luck with your purchase if you decide to buy</li>
      <li>: it looks good on the&lt;br /&gt;counter, doesn&#x27;t take up alot of space,</li>
      <li>Afterall, what good is it to purchase \\&quot;steralized\\&quot; swabs to end up on the bottom of a cabinet floor?  </li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>It looks good &amp; saves space too.</li>
      <li>LOL..:))</li>
      <li>It was a great idea in theory but in reality we store cotton swabs in it &amp; leave the lid off so we can grab them out of the top.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very cute style for the bathroom</li>
      <li>This is a very cute idea, but it&#x27;s not practical.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very stylish goes with just about any decorative design..</li>
      <li>Love the idea and great for if space</li>
      <li>Very challenging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my \\&quot;Qube\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The cube has a nice weight to it and it is made of good quality acrylic.</li>
      <li>Love this item!</li>
      <li>I will buy more - for baby gifts and for every bathroom!</li>
      <li>But it looks better than that box sitting there!  </li>
      <li>If you are working in dirt and need about 10 of them for ears and nose better have a backup easier to get to!</li>
      <li>So, It looks like I will either take them out of the top or just chuck it!</li>
      <li>I was so glad when I came across this item!  </li>
      <li>The lid especially is so light it pops off easily with any jostling.</li>
      <li>Its a very nice product, except when i put my cotton swabs in many began to fall out, and when i put them in the weren&#x27;t a good position so the cotton swabs couldn&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
      <li>Not as amazing as I thought.</li>
      <li>It is a nice size and fits well in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
      <li>Oh well, nice try.</li>
      <li>It is a nice compact size.</li>
      <li>once you take the time to stack them it is a nice piece for the bathroom</li>
      <li>Then again, i literally stacked them in there nice and neat one by one..  </li>
      <li>This looks nice on the bathroom counter</li>
      <li>I made the mistake of buying three of these, thinking they would come in handy at home and at work.  </li>
      <li>But it loos nice.</li>
      <li>It really isn&#x27;t the cubes fault, the q-tips sometimes snag on eachother even when you stack them perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I got this because it looked so nice and practical in the picture</li>
      <li>But, it is a nice way to keep the Q-tips on the sink without it looking cluttered.</li>
      <li>It was a nice idea though.</li>
      <li>Qtips do not come through the bottom nicely.</li>
      <li>I bought this to keep the Q-tips handy and neatly stored.</li>
      <li>Still using it and loving</li>
      <li>When I saw this item I thought it would be a nice way to store Q-Tips.</li>
      <li>its a raely nice orgnizer for the cotton sewab  </li>
      <li>The q tips do not go in nicely as pictured and the lid came chipped with my order.</li>
      <li>Perfect in bathroom and doesn&#x27;t require much space on counter.</li>
      <li>HOwever, I could not get the swabs to load in as nice as it looks in the picture.  </li>
      <li>It will not stand any kind of abuse.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love having something besides a Dixie cup to put our cotton swabs in, it is so hard to put them in in a way they won&#x27;t get all tangled!</li>
    <li> Qtips do not come through the bottom nicely. We always take off the top lid and take them out. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this to get free shipping and still don&#x27;t like it. It is a pain to load and pointless. I am going to throw it a way when I get home.</li>
    <li> The unit looks nice but it is hard to put the qtips into it making it difficult to use and not worth the time or the hassle of it all.</li>
    <li> this product is OK, but you have to put Q-tips in PERFECTLY straight (exactly like the picture) in order for it to work. Most of us know that when you take Q-tips out of the box, there is about a 1% chance they will all stay straight as youu drop them into a dispenser. I usually just take the lid off and grab them from the top instead of using the dispenser part because it is difficult. I would say this is best if you have short shelves and want to be able to access your Q-tips without having to grab them from the top.</li>
    <li> it would take me forever (hours) to get the q-tips lined up like that.  also they don&#x27;t slide out very easily so we end up just opening the lid.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for q-tip dispensery.  Maybe it would be better for toothpicks?</li>
    <li> This product is okay. It requires a lot of time to put the Qtips in straight or they do not come out right.  I ended up taking the cover off and just using them from the top.</li>
    <li> Product always looked so neat and wanted to&lt;br /&gt;try this for some time.  I purchased two and am not&lt;br /&gt;happy with it.  The Q-tips get caught; they do not stay&lt;br /&gt;nice and neat.....not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Love this item! Q-tips get a bit messy sometimes, so if you&#x27;re OCD I don&#x27;t recommend this but a product that would keep them straight instead.</li>
    <li> came cracked 2 places and near impossable to load without looking like a the game pick-up sticks. wouldnt buy again. might through this away.</li>
    <li> we use this in our bathroom and enjoy the fact you can see how many are left and easy to get them out of holder</li>
    <li> not the easiest to fill.  Cotton swabs have to be in the cube neatly for dispensing. But it looks better than that box sitting there!  I like it.</li>
    <li> although I didn&#x27;t care for this for q tips, I have large fingers,&lt;br /&gt; it works perfect for splenda packets.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stack right or dispense.  Don&#x27;t bother. Cheaply made had a crack in it.</li>
    <li> This cube is just right!  It holds plenty of q-tips and keeps them clean in the bathroom.  You need to keep q-tips lined up straight from the package to fit into cube for best dispensing. Smart design and good value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my \\&quot;Qube\\&quot;. It holds my q-tips and dispenses as described in the item description. It is difficult to fill it as the tips have to be in there just right to dispense, but it still works if a few are askew. Overall it is good enough for who it&#x27;s for (me); I would recommend this for home use only and it is easy to wash.</li>
    <li> It is a bit difficult to load smoothly but otherwise a great container to keep Q-tips in a nightstand drawer.</li>
    <li> Looks very nice and keeps Qtips free of dust .  Hard to fill but as it holds a lot of Qtips you only have to do this every so many weeks.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t place the Q-tips in there just right, they will not come out easily.  Got frustrated with it, tossed it out.</li>
    <li> This is okay, but the swabs must in VERY STRAIGHT for them to drop into the dispensing area.  If one swab is the least bit &amp;#34;off kilter&amp;#34; it&#x27;s practically impossible to remove it from the slot.  And believe me, putting the swabs into the container straight takes time as you have to put in just a few at a time and make sure the next ones you put in it don&#x27;t mess up those already inside.  And sometimes the one you take out of the slot in the bottom sticks to another swab inside and pulls it &amp;#34;off kilter&amp;#34; to the slot, thereby making the next one impossible to remove without taking all the swabs out and restacking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been just taking the top off to remove a swab.  I used to have an apothecary-type jar that has a tray the swabs rest on and comes up when you take the lid off (like those containers for drinking straws), but it broke in our move.  Haven&#x27;t been able to find one to replace it.</li>
    <li> This little acrylic box with removable lid saved me a LOT of trouble! Like many families we would purchase the largest box of swabs possible only to open the \\&quot;reclosable\\&quot; lid on the package itself, to find them turned upside down beneath the bathroom sink!  We fill it (it holds a large amount of swabs) and replace the lid and it keeps swabs clean &amp; fresh and you can pull one out at a time as needed!  No more spilled swabs! Afterall, what good is it to purchase \\&quot;steralized\\&quot; swabs to end up on the bottom of a cabinet floor?  This little acrylic box is just what our family needed - now if they wanted to get extravagant and make them in designer colors, that would be a good thing too but I cannot say enough great things about this neat and marvelous little acrylic box!  My family just loves it - and so do I!  Thank you to whomever designed this little gadget! You&#x27;ve saved me a lot of time, headaches and money! Ofcourse you can put cotton swabs, cotton balls, facial rounds, just about any item used for health and beauty purposes in this little box.....not just swabs alone.  Guess that is what makes it so unique.  I would recommend this to everyone I know especially family members with kids!  Its been a Godsend for me!</li>
    <li> Ours came with a broken lid</li>
    <li> I foolishly thought I could get it to work the way it shows in the picture. It may be just me, but it is hard for me to get the Q-tips out because I couldn&#x27;t get them all to line up strait. But, it is a nice way to keep the Q-tips on the sink without it looking cluttered. I had no issue with the top opening or closing as I had seen on  another review.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  Takes a bit to refill if you want them all straight, but it is very useful and looks good on my bathroom counter (unlike all the bulky boxes that I had before).</li>
    <li> This is very convenient and sanitary! I keep this in my bathroom (of course) and it keeps the tips of the swabs sanitary.</li>
    <li> I think the idea is great, but it really doesn&#x27;t work the way you want it to.  I have put the q-tips in a number of times (one time with tweezers to make sure each q-tip was aligned  and it still didn&#x27;t fall the way it should have.  It really isn&#x27;t the cubes fault, the q-tips sometimes snag on eachother even when you stack them perfectly.  Over all I like the item, but if I was going to shop again from scratch I would get a box or something that I wouldn&#x27;t care if the q-tips are stacked neatly.  not for people who are perfectionists.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep our cat from playing with cotton swabs.  Alas, it is not cat-proof.  It arrived chipped. Ended up in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking \\&quot;now I can keep my cotton swabs out on the counter\\&quot;.  I have toothpick holders similar to this and love using them.  Well, this thing is absolutely useless because the cotton gets caught on each other and doesn&#x27;t fall nicely.  First day I filled it up, I stacked each cotton swab by hand.  After a week or so, all of the swabs got tangled and wouldn&#x27;t come out.  So I took all the swabs out using a pair of tweezers to neatly re-stack each one.  This time it lasted 2 weeks before I gave up.  The only reason it lasted 2 weeks was because I would move any that started to look like it wasn&#x27;t aligned correctly with tweezers EVERY DAY.  I feel like they got dirtier the more I had to move each swab.  So unless you are going to take the top off and use it like that, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a clear cube that holds your standard-sized \\&quot;cotton swabs.\\&quot;  It makes your bathroom look pretty, and if you don&#x27;t like either leaving the box out all the time or going to a cabinet to get swabs out every morning, this thing is a must-have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint on here is that it is nontrivial to reload.  You don&#x27;t think about it until you try it, and then you&#x27;re left scratching your head.  If you try grabbing swabs out of the box and dropping them in the Qube, you will get a jumbled mess of swabs that don&#x27;t easily come out of the front and don&#x27;t look pretty like in the picture.  This also significantly reduces the capacity of the Qube, because they are not loaded efficiently.  If you take the cotton swab box and turn it upside down over the Qube... same problem, they get all jumbled up, and now you&#x27;ve probably lost 10 or so swabs that fell out over the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD NEWS EVERYONE: I HAVE THE SECRET TO RELOADING THIS THING.  You don&#x27;t have to take swabs out one at a time and stack them.  I&#x27;m going to be thorough here, but it&#x27;s easier than it sounds.  Take a look at your box of cotton swabs.  It has a plastic side that holds the swabs, and a cardboard backing with a \\&quot;door\\&quot; you can open to get at the swabs.  First, go ahead and open that door a little ways (enough to get a few fingers though anyway).  Then, take a utility knife (scissors would probably work too) and cut off the end of the box furthest from the door on the cardboard backing.  Line the end of your box of swabs that you cut open with the opening on top of the Qube, and gently push on the q-tips though the door on the back.  They may jumble a little bit, but for the most part, they should load rather cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can fit a little more than half of a box of 300 cotton swabs into the Qube at a time in this way and they come out easily.  I estimate maybe 180 swabs, although I don&#x27;t intend to count them.  At first, I was frustrated with the fact that you can&#x27;t just grab swabs and throw them in the Qube, but the method described above only takes a few seconds and is quite effective.  Four stars because it does what it says it will do and looks nice, but they really should tell you in advance that it&#x27;s a bit challenging to load the thing up.but the method described above only takes a few seconds and is quite effective.

    <li> This looks nice on the bathroom counter but you can&#x27;t load up the q-tips like in the picture. The q-tips aren&#x27;t all neat in arrow and this makes it difficult to pull them out at the bottom. It&#x27;s doable but a little irritating. My husband just takes the lid off. But it&#x27;s inexpensive so I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
    <li> Nice little Q-tip box for the bathroom counter.  Makes them neat and easy to access.  We are pleased with this container.</li>
    <li> It is a little bit of a pain to load it up.  You have to do a few at a time otherwise they get all crossed then wont be able to dispense.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this (I know i&#x27;m weird but I love organization) I even spent the 5 minutes of putting the qtips in perfectly. They keep getting backed up and it just doesn&#x27;t work. So for now I will keep looking and this can go in our guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> No matter how carefully you put the q- tips in, it twists up inside and creates a chain effect to the rest of them. We just remove the lid and pull from the top.</li>
    <li> I also bought this cause it was made of acrylic...Looks pretty on my bathroom sink. Plain n simple. There is something about products made from acrylic I just love.</li>
    <li> This Q-tip dispenser is a space-saver that looks nice and does exactly what it says. Set toothpaste, a toothbrush or other lightweight items on top of it and don&#x27;t worry about having to open it to get at the contents. You will have to take a few minutes to lay the Q-tips in straight-- you can&#x27;t just toss them in and expect this to work. Once you get it filled, though, you&#x27;ll be set for a while. The Q-tips don&#x27;t just slide down to the slot during use. You need to use a finger to push one down to the opening to get it out. That&#x27;s what the long vertical opening on the front is for. I think the only way to improve this would be to make it wall-mountable. As-is, it keeps all the Q-tips in once place, is easy to use and looks good too. Convenient and affordable!</li>
    <li> While this dispenser will hold a large supply of cotton swabs while keeping them dry &amp; dust-free, swabs will not stack like those in the picture without a lot of effort, and as a result do not always dispense easily. AND, if you do get them all stacked perfectly, they don&#x27;t stay that way. BUT, they are normally dispensable without lifting the top or handling the business ends.</li>
    <li> I bought this q-tip container because I was tired of using them straight out of the ugly box, and I liked the neatness that this product would provide. I have to say I am disappointed. It is a lovely design, very clean and neat, but it&#x27;s not very functional. It&#x27;s very hard to get the q-tips in like they show in the picture. You cannot just dump them in. Even putting them in one by one (which I actually did once) doesn&#x27;t guarantee a good result. When the q-tips aren&#x27;t aligned perfectly in the box, they don&#x27;t drop down to the slot properly. And then, the more q-tips you manage to remove, the more tangled up the q-tips on the inside get, eventually rendering the entire thing useless. I have stopped trying to keep the q-tips organized, and I usually just fight to grab one out of the bottom or simply open up the top. Sadly, this product needs some more work before it will be useful on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> If the q-tips would ever really lay flat ontop of one another than it would be fantastic, but you almost need to take the time to carefully place each one inside in order to be able to get them out of the bottom part perfectly. Not the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made at least it was cheap.</li>
    <li> Even if the q-tips are not placed \\&quot;just right\\&quot; as the photo shows, they are not impossible to get out of the box.  If you take them out of the original box a little bit at a time they do stack nicer in the dispenser.  That being said, my husband is known for just grabbing a handful of q-tips and dumping them in...it is not that big of a deal.  The top does come off very easily so taking that off and grabbing one out works for us too.  I only purchased the one in order to save on overall shipping but I am going to purchase a second one for my bathroom as well.  The box is very easy to clean.  But I suspect that if it falls it will crack/break.  So we are careful not to place it near an edge.  That being said, through normal use this little baby will last.</li>
    <li> Thought this would help as you grab them out of the dispenser, but they get out of order in the container and my husband gets frustrated and just takes the lid off.</li>
    <li> I ended up taking off the lid (which does not stay on very securely) and just pulling the swabs out of the top because it is impossible to get the swabs loaded in the right way to pull them out of the dispenser area on the front. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. You&#x27;re probably better off just buying a plastic box.</li>
    <li> A little troublesome to get q tips in there</li>
    <li> It was made to hold Q-Tip Cotton Swabs.  Though it is rather small in size, getting th Q-Tips out through the top(where you fill it) is easier than  through the opening provided in the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works just fine.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for on this one. its compact, but difficult to get your daily q-tip out of the little container. We have wound up leaving the lid off and just grabbing from the top.</li>
    <li> I like this little cube. It keeps my Q-tips within reach on my counter. Filling it takes some time because you have to make sure the Q-tips are properly aligned for easy dispensation, but you&#x27;re not going to be filling it every week so it isn&#x27;t a big deal for me. It&#x27;s clear acrylic and looks clean and clinical on my counter. Considering the low price of entry, I don&#x27;t see why anyone wouldn&#x27;t buy this handy little cube!</li>
    <li> Qtips CONSTANTLY getting stuck and bending them to get out. Too narrow</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t let the cotton swabs come through the little handy dispenser! Wished it did because it is a cute little item</li>
    <li> It broke pretty soon after purchase.  The plastic is brittle.</li>
    <li> Definitely a space saver in the bathroom.  This qtip holder keeps them dust free and ready to use.  Very simple to reload and keeps cotton swabs easily within reach.  Simple 1-hand operation.</li>
    <li> Yes sometimes u have to lightly drag down the qtips but it is just a flick of ur finger I don&#x27;t even notice I&#x27;m doing it half the time. I love how much less space this takes up then the whole qtip box.  I had a lot of anxiety ordering this because of all the bad reviews and honestly I wish I never read those reviews because the bottom line is i love mine and will be buying another one!</li>
    <li> This acrylic dispenser is darling! I had to individually line the dispenser with the q-tips.  You can&#x27;t just throw them in there and expect them to dispense easily.  Take your time lining them up and they will dispense properly!!!</li>
    <li> This thing may look better than the box the cotton swabs come in, but it much less efficient.&lt;br /&gt;The cotton swabs will not all line up perfectly and, because of this, they will not dispense properly.&lt;br /&gt;It does not matter if you line up each cotton swab by hand perfectly, as soon as you pull one out the others get jumbled.&lt;br /&gt;Also disappointed that it does not hold an entire package of swabs.&lt;br /&gt;So now it is just taking up space because I still have to keep the original package 3/4 filled with swabs and this disaster of a thing, which no longer has the top on it because I have to get the swabs out from the top opening.&lt;br /&gt;(top doesn&#x27;t snap on or connect well anyway, it just sits lightly on top and at the slightest touch, falls off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be inexpensive, but it is not even worth that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew cotton swabs would get me in such a tizzy?</li>
    <li> I filled the dispenser very carefully with the swabs so they would come out of the bottom easily.  Didn&#x27;t work.  The swabs got stuck and the outlet is too small for a man&#x27;s fingers.</li>
    <li> If you put the swabs in \\&quot;unorganized\\&quot; they will straighten out somewhat with use.  The lid does not stay very well, especially if over-full (tape would help).  It works well at being in-obtrusive and allowing something to be put atop for space management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA (Origin USA)</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it would make my life easier but I was wrong. It is difficult to set the cotton swabs in there properly and when you actually take the time to do it, they do not come out as easy as expected. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> It looks really nice on my vanity, but it doesn&#x27;t hold an entire normal sized box of q-tips, so now I have a box that&#x27;s still 1/3 full sitting in my drawer. They also don&#x27;t come out as easy as I would like, but I am using really cheapy q-tips, so that may be the problem.</li>
    <li> Have fun trying to get your q tips in just right so it works!</li>
    <li> Works well in my bathroom, however, the q-tips do not come out easily from the bottom.  I take the top off and take them from there.  Still convenient.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this for a while and I&#x27;m here to order a different model.  Top came off and the qtips just don&#x27;t sit right in it.  I sit the top on it for hygiene&#x27;s sake, but it&#x27;s cloudy and dirty. Back to old fashioned reach in kind!</li>
    <li> It does the job it was intended to do. The only thing that annoyed me was that it was a bit difficult to get all the cotton swabs to line up straight in the cube. Some people would not be bothered by this, but I had to take the time to get all of them straight. Once I did that, it seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the q tips inside the box where they easily distribute through the bottom opening. We just end up taking the lid off the top and grabbing one. May as well just used a jar.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it will serve the purpose.... But, I can not for the life of me figure out how they got them in there so neat.  No matter how carefully I tried to place them they do not stack that neatly.  If there is a trick that I am missing please let me know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited a few months to write this review to give it a fair shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a great idea at first, but the execution is poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many others have said before, it&#x27;s practically IMPOSSIBLE to place your q-tips into this dispenser as advertised. They will twist, turn, flip around. and you&#x27;ll only be able to grab 1 or 2 q-tips before you just open the top and grab one of the q-tips from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s actually what I&#x27;ve done now, I leave the lid off (placed behind the qube and leaning against the counter) and just grab qtips from the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT buy this again. If you have $5 to burn, go ahead and buy it, or you can just grab a lighter, and burn that $5 bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t thrown this away just yet, because I&#x27;m trying to think of an alternative use for it. If someone has an idea, please let me know by leaving a comment.</li>
    <li> This is a very cute idea, but it&#x27;s not practical. Unless you get the Q-Tips in there perfectly aligned, you have to struggle just to get any out. Thankfully it&#x27;s only 4 bucks and didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> When I saw this item I thought it would be a nice way to store Q-Tips. HOwever, I could not get the swabs to load in as nice as it looks in the picture.  Our Qtips are all uneven and it is difficult to get one out.  We take them from the top, which also does not tightly fit over the dispenser.  Must be a trick to getting them in there the way shown.</li>
    <li> I took the time to neatly place the q-tips in the dispenser but they still do not come out properly. Do not waste your money on this item.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it says, a cotton swab dispenser. Q-tip boxes are big and take up too much space in the cabinet I have hanging over the toilet. It is an organized and compact container that is easier to get at without opening the drawer under the sink and shuffling through the product that moves around every time the drawer is opened &amp; closed. I learned two important lessons after filling it for the first time. One, you need to put the q-tips in one or two at a time so that they are put in straight. If not, the more you take out, the more tangled they get. Two, do not fill it up all the way.  I like to fill it about 75%.  This way there is room for the q-tips to move as you take them out. It only takes a few minutes every couple of weeks to refill and hassle free in between. It does exactly what I wanted and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I initially had a problem with my product.  I contacted seller thru Amazon and rec&#x27;d a response within 24 hrs and a replacement product within days.  GREAT customer service.  Would happily order from them again.  THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> Not a great design. We ended up just taking the lid off and using it that way, but it does hold the swabs.</li>
    <li> the lid was broken when received and another unit was quickly shipped.  it is thin plastic and the lid does not secure in place, so we lost a bunch of qtips when the unit was dropped on the floor.  the qtips do not come out without a struggle.  i dont like it and would not reccommend it.</li>
    <li> this is pretty handy. i don&#x27;t like how it&#x27;s curved on the inside but it does get the job done. it was a good price and arrived on time. i would recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I liked it at first for quick dispensing in our family bathroom, however, after about a week or two it was just faster to keep the lid off and take them out Q-Tips out that way.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with hopes of #1 having a nice organizer for my q-tips and #2 easy dispencing of the q-tips. I was half wrong. This would have been perfect if I didnt have to struggle to grab a q-tip from the dispenser. So instead I use the top of it where you would normally refill the q-tips.</li>
    <li> Love the idea and great for if space but it&#x27;s not like toothpicks where it falls down in the dispenser portion. I love it but I wish it worked a little better but I think thats more the q-tip portion getting caught up on itself.</li>
    <li> I wish this thing really did dispense the swabs one at a time. But you have to carefully fill it up yourself and strategically maneuver each one you wish to use.</li>
    <li> I was thinking this would be a great option for dispensing my cotton swabs. Not, it is really hard to get then out of the narrow slot at the bottom. Unless you have them perfectly stacked ( which I took the time to try) there is no way you will get them out of the bottom slot. So, It looks like I will either take them out of the top or just chuck it!</li>
    <li> q-tips jam at the bottom. It&#x27;s stylish, but not super practical. You have to make sure they&#x27;re inserted properly or spend a few seconds fiddling with them to be able to get them out if they&#x27;re not. On the bright side, no one holds them from the cotton swab part when taking one out, so at least it&#x27;s hygienic in that regard.</li>
    <li> This is just a copy of toothpick dispenser made large.  However Q tips&#x27; cotton makes it impossible for them to fall smoothly.  after one week everything will be tangles and you will have to open the lid to get one.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.  Get the pop up one instead - doesn&#x27;t hold as many but at least it works.</li>
    <li> Its a handy little q-tip container...looks nice but its time consuming to fill, they all have to be lined perfectly for them to come out ... but its nice</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to get one of these as I did not think the wife would like it sitting on the counter. It sat in my cart for months before I finally made the purchase. I had fashioned a swab holder from the packaging that the swabs came in, cutting and taping until it was a palm sized holder. I set it out and the wife thought it was cute and we used it up until we got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loaded it half way with swabs, adjusting and trying to make them look straight as in the picture. I never quite got it to look that good. I think I spent less than a two minutes on it. I figured if we have to dig with our fingers to pull one out then no big deal. I might sit on the edge of our bed and take the time to make a nice even fill the next time the wife starts a conversation from the bathroom and I lend an ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I do not have to refill a dispenser as often as I was before with my little crafty cut out dispenser. This one holds a lot as you can see from the picture. Not much to it so I will stop here with the review already.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, the only thing is that the q-tips don&#x27;t like to fit into it in a way that makes them come out the bottom straight. You have to place them specifically in order to have them look like the picture.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. Damn near impossible to load cotton swabs and even harder to get one out! I bought two. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Its a very nice product, except when i put my cotton swabs in many began to fall out, and when i put them in the weren&#x27;t a good position so the cotton swabs couldn&#x27;t come out easily. And I couldn&#x27;t fix the way I put it anyway</li>
    <li> It stores cotton swabs, but they do tend to get tangled up and it&#x27;s not real easy to get them out.  I had to give it a try, but am not real impressed.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this one until I find something better.</li>
    <li> Looks great but the swabs never stay straight. Took a while to get the swabs to sit straight in the cube. Once it was full, it looked great. The swabs at first were easy to access, but after more were used they would not stay straight in the cube and became increasingly difficult to access from the front slot. Therefore I had to use the top cover, which is not how I wanted to access the swabs. I should have known this and chose another container.</li>
    <li> I was already iffy about buying because of the reviews but I figured for six bucks I&#x27;ll try it. There&#x27;s no way this thng look like it will work without makin a mess. The gap is too wide wear u pull it out and will make it all come out most likely. Why even bother</li>
    <li> sometimes it is hard to get the qtips out of the bottom so I have to take the lid off but I still like it</li>
    <li> This was what I was looking for to keep my Q-tips neat and organized.  I use Q-tips on a daily basis so I was looking for something stylish to keep on bathroom counter.  This fits the bill perfectly. However,  I wish the company who made this product made other items in clear acrylic that matched this line.   The cube has a nice weight to it and it is made of good quality acrylic. This is not some flimsy plastic that will break easily.  I have already dropped this on the bathroom floor and no chips or breaks!!  The only reason I am giving it a 4 out of 5 stars is that it is a little difficult to get the Q-tips to line up properly in the container. I found it is easier to put the Q-tips into the cube when they are fresh out the box, still packaged from the factory in neat lines!</li>
    <li> There does not seem to be a way to smoothly get them in, so they end up looking all messy and get tangled trying to come out.  Also the lid falls off with the slightest touch.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning it, but I won&#x27;t be using it for long.</li>
    <li> I put my dispenser in my master bath and it is very conventional to use it!!! It looks organizer, clean and ready to use!!!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Complete pain trying to get the cotton swabs to line up nicely and drop down correctly. So get something better.</li>
    <li> Not particularly easy to fill but it keeps the Qtips clean, easy to access and looks better than a box.  My husband has issues with the dispensing because he has very large hands.  He takes the top off and uses it his way.  The only issue is the loading of the product.</li>
    <li> Not good. Huge pain to maintain, and load. Got rid of it.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to get the Q-tips to line up perfectly and then they overlap and very difficult to get out from the bottom. I would not reccomend</li>
    <li> I do not like this.  The Q tips get stuck and are impossible to get out of the slot.  I would not purchase again</li>
    <li> Never works. The q-tips are always jumbled and don&#x27;t dispense. The bottom falls off and all the q-tips fall out.</li>
    <li> Cute and saves space but it is hard to refill so that the q-tips roll out easily. They keep stacking funny</li>
    <li> One really has to get the swabs aligned exactly in the dispenser, straight out of the factory box.  If they become crossed or jumbled at all then they require some effort to dispense through the bottom opening.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a Q-tip dispenser. I have non-brand swabs in there, which may be a 1/8&amp;#34; smaller than brand, but they are constantly crooked and not falling into the slot on the bottom.  I usually have to just lift off the top and grab one from the pile. That pic is VERY misleading. I mean, look how perfect those swabs are - Q-tip perfection on the counter! Not in my case, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> The Qtips didn&#x27;t come out the bottom they&#x27;d always get crossed. I&#x27;d put them in there perfect &amp; they&#x27;d get crossed. Sorry didn&#x27;t care for this product.</li>
    <li> The idea that you can fill this with cotton swabs &amp; grab one or two from the bottom is a great idea. However, in order for that to work you would have to place each cotton swab in individually so they are all perfectly straight. And then you would have to have cotton swabs where the cotton doesn&#x27;t grab onto the other ones. It was a great idea in theory but in reality we store cotton swabs in it &amp; leave the lid off so we can grab them out of the top.</li>
    <li> I had a very difficult time trying to load the q-tips in the dispenser.  It was a nice idea though.</li>
    <li> I use it regularly but only for the top that slides off.  Qtips never come out of the bottom like you would think.  I expected it work like restaurant toothpick holders but the Qtips Always get mixed up and don&#x27;t sit right.</li>
    <li> My house is very dusty and I didn&#x27;t like having out Q-tips in an open cup so I got this.  It&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> Really awesome idea for q-tips, especially because I use q-tips so often. There are 2 things I don&#x27;t like about it though; first is that it takes forever to fill because the q-tips don&#x27;t like to cooperate when you put in too many at a time, and second is that they don&#x27;t come out that easy from the opening. It is a nice size and fits well in my bathroom cabinet. Also beats leaving the q-tips in the box.</li>
    <li> Need to reflect some of the other reviews that I&#x27;ve read- this thing is a real pain to load easily. Its nice to hold a whole bunch of Q-tips but I probably should have gone with something else.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to get the q-tips in straight, but I am using it daily. Sometimes have to coax the next one out.</li>
    <li> Like but lid falls off when you touch</li>
    <li> Q-tips do not slide down into the pick up spot. They get stuck and tied up in each other. You will wind up having to just lift the lid and remove them from the top. Keeps them clean though.</li>
    <li> I guess it serves its purpose.  I mean, It holds the q-tips and it doesn&#x27;t make them explode.  Or smell.  Or judge me.  But they get all stuck together and its a time trying to get one out of the hole at the bottom.  For $6 Id rather just keep them in their ugly original box under my sink.</li>
    <li> Q-tips do not fit smoothly and are difficult to get out of the dispensing opening</li>
    <li> Not convenient, swabs get stuck inside, sticking to each other, so you have to put your finger inside to get one.</li>
    <li> As expected, despite best efforts, the qtips never stack well and certainly do not stay stacked well as you take them out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable to get the cotton swabs out because they just don&#x27;t fall in the box as orderly as the picture shows. So it&#x27;s easier to take them out by removing the top lid and putting it back on.</li>
    <li> Qtip cotton sticks together.  To assume they will cascade down to the dispensing slot in order is just not going to happen.  Bottom line I am taking the top off the cube just like the last dispenser I had.  Oh well, nice try.</li>
    <li> I like the concept of the qube. It is a nice compact size. It only got 3 stars because the qtips don&#x27;t come out very well if you don&#x27;t put them in it perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a fine q-tip holder as long as you don&#x27;t touch it. If you move it to clean etc, you have to slide it on to your hand to pick it up because if you just grab it to lift it the top comes off and the q-tips go everywhere.</li>
    <li> The idea was great. It has good intent, but the overall design was flawed. The q-tips couldn&#x27;t quite get in the box unless you make it a jumbled mess. Which would prohibit the use of the device properly. It was cheap, but if I had the decision to buy it or not again I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Really like this and I do recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and what you need is easy access.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to.  Takes patients to get it loaded and nimble fingers to get one dispensed which is tough in the morning.</li>
    <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t cost very much but it is useless!  Unless you load it perfectly, ( don&#x27;t know how you could) you aren&#x27;t able to get them out of the bottom.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I thought it was cute and would save space, but if you don&#x27;t have tiny fingers or place the swabs in the container exactly as shown in the pic it doesn&#x27;t work. The top is not secured at all it always falls off. I guess for the price and got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Another product that keeps the little stuff organized. The only gripe is that you have to get them perfectly situated for them to roll out and the top is quite annoying, it always falls off. I still recommend it because it looks great.</li>
    <li> I thought maybe the naysayers were just too lazy to put the tips in carefully, so I bought one anyway. I placed them mall in carefully, but they don&#x27;t fall out orderly. Money wasted</li>
    <li> Makes no sense -- I would challenge anybody who is not affiliated with the company who says that this is a worthwhile gadget to upload a video to Youtube showing the proper way to load and use.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- I love gadgets but this thing is a piece of frustrating junk.  The well written review with the lady&#x27;s &amp;#34;secret to loading&amp;#34; does not work either (her review is reason that I bought it).  You have to push with your fingers from one end with the box upside down in an unnatural position and when the Q-tips fall out of the end that the other reviewer suggests you cut in the box, they criss cross as they drop down to the container and then all hope is lost.  It is impossible to take nicely-oriented, machine-loaded boxed Qtips and transfer them to this dispenser without them losing their &amp;#34;neat orientation&amp;#34;.  What Qube should have down is sold this dispenser or its patent to one of the Qtip companies and you should be able to buy them in a disposable version of this dispenser pre-loaded by a machine that keeps them in the rows that they need to be in to dispense one at a time and then have the next swab drop into place.  This thing is only pennies worth of plastic anyway.  Also the removable lid is almost square (but not quite -- only goes one way) and when I put it on wrong it cracked on the first time.  It should have an orientation symbol to help you put the lid on correctly.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or time -- this one is going back for a refund.  This is one invention that does not work!  This is not worth $0.595 let along $5.95.</li>
    <li> Does not really hold much considering it makes a larger than average footprint.Then again, I guess it would be dependent on what your planned purpose was in utilizing this cube to accomplish. I was unimpressed by the design  and it did not serve my purposes well. I wound up discarding this cube because it took up more space in my bathroom cabinet then it was worth.</li>
    <li> I will not stand any kind of rough use.  It will not stand any kind of abuse.  It meets the need of making the bathroom counter much neater, and putting q-tips immediately at hand without having to search for the.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap plastic quality, and I still have not figured out a way to fill this where the swabs dispense to the bottom straight where you don&#x27;t have to reach in and pull it out. I gave it two stars because it was only $5.</li>
    <li> I love this little thing. I can put so many q-tips in it at once and only take one out at a time if I want. I no longer drop q-tips on the floor! Awesome, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I mistakenly thought that this was one of those dispensers that you push down in front to allow the swabs to be dispensed 1 or 2 at a time - like a drinking strawer dispenser. But this is just a static cube box with an open in the front. Unfortunately my cotton swabs don&#x27;t rest neatly/straight across in this box but on an angle instead. So because the swabs are often on an angle and not aligned with the straight opening in front, it&#x27;s often easier to just take the lid off to get at the swabs than having to fight with trying to release a single one from a bunch that has become knotted up in the opening in front. Will likely be trashing and replacing this dispenser with another solution.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to fill</li>
    <li> the q-tips don&#x27;t roll out easily, they get tangled and stuck</li>
    <li> One of them arrived cracked in the corner but not to bad where I couldn&#x27;t use. Other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea, but good luck getting the cotton swabs to line up perfectly so that they dispense properly. I gave up and just leave the top off now...</li>
    <li> Getting the Q-tips in and/or out is not easy.   But it looks good and is an adequate dispenser.</li>
    <li> It makes my shelf look neat, and its not as difficult to pack as other reviews make it seem. One person suggested opening the box of cotton swabs and dumping in the dispenser straight from the opening of the box. That works pretty well but dropping a bunch of swabs from your hand isn&#x27;t that messy either. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just not that OCD about it.</li>
    <li> It holds my qtips and lets me have them nice and neat on my counter on the sink. Thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> Awesome not cheap looking at all</li>
    <li> That I am unhappy with this product is all on me. Well most of it is on me. The purchase of this product in on me. The design part of this is all on the manufacturer or designer. I didn&#x27;t give this much thought when I clicked \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot; and did not look at the reviews because after all its a Q-Tip holder. How complicated could a Q-Tip holder be. Having just said all that, THIS IS RIDICULOUSLY PAINFUL TO FILL. Not in a physical way but in a mental way. The box does not open. The only \\&quot;opening\\&quot; is the area from which you pull down the q-tip. The design leaves you to stand there or sit there, slipping one or two q-tips at a time into the same opening you remove them from when you want a Q-Tip. This insertion process requires that you insert them in a very specific way, as not to have the q-tips end up tangled together, which would make it then virtually impossible to easily withdraw a q-tip at the time of need. I don&#x27;t really know how long it took me to fill this thing but that it took any real time to do this, is what makes it ridiculous.   Yes, its sleek and neat looking and its design might not matter to some. And I guess it might not matter to me if I wasn&#x27;t so fixed on using my time to do what should otherwise be a simple process in such an inefficient way. Or if I didn&#x27;t have tons of other things that needed a real effort to get done. Filling a q-tip dispenser just doesn&#x27;t seem to qualify in my life as something I want to spend a lot of time doing. I know that I will not be re-filling this product when that time comes.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Perfect size for bathroom</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the one star reviews before buying this.  It is horrible!  You have to constantly try to readjust to get the dispenser to work.  It is not convenient to use this product, which is the entire purpose!  I hope no one else gets taken by this bad design!</li>
    <li> This dispenser is not easy at all to place your Q-tips in so they just roll out on the bottom like you would like a straw or toothpick dispenser would.  They probably need to sell a tool with it that helps you place them neatly in for easy dispensing on the bottom.  DOn&#x27;t buy unless you are a OCD and has the time to place each and every q-tip in a row.</li>
    <li> This sucks....Don&#x27;t buy it.  The qtips don&#x27;t lay in this like the picture shows and it doesn&#x27;t dispenser them either.  Watch the youtube video associated with this product it shows the actual frustration of this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the extra hours it takes to sit there and nicely stack the q-tips one by one in this thing to make them come out of the dispenser.  We still use this to hold the q-tips, but we ended up taking the lid off.  Seems to work okay.  If I had a do-over, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  For the price, it wasn&#x27;t worth it to return though, so we just make it work.</li>
    <li> Even if you are OCD enough to load the damn thing, good luck getting the swabs out of it. Finding a small enough box to return it will cost more than $6, so I guess its going to get recycled.</li>
    <li> item shipped very fast.  Product looks just as displayed.  It&#x27;s very time consuming to get all of the q-tip lined up properly for them to dispense correctly.  Am I happy with my purchase?  I suppose.  Would I order another?  Probably not.  It does look good on my counter top and keeps my q-tips clean and organized.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be cool to dispense my cotton swabs in the bathroom.  I wanted it to work. I was very disappointed and it was very frustrating to try to use. The swabs do not want to &amp;#34;line up&amp;#34; correctly and will not stay lined up with usage.  They do not &amp;#34;dispense&amp;#34; like you would think (like toothpicks for example). Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one - stick with a pretty jar or something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a neat freak so these really helped clear up some space in an organized fashion.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to get the cotton swabs out of this monster!</li>
    <li> You have to get the q-tips in PERFECT inorder to keep them from falling out the front of the dispenser. If they are not lined up PERFECT they just spill out everywhere. I doubt I&#x27;ll be actually using this thing.  Save your money and use a glass jar (or recycle an old candle jar)!!! This thing was junk!</li>
    <li> If you have 5-8 hours to perfectly align your q-tips so that the dispenser looks as pictured, knock yourself out. The q-tips won&#x27;t sit nicely and the whole point of the dispenser is lost.  Basically, you&#x27;re better off with the q-tip holders that you can just fill vertically, open the lid and pull one out.</li>
    <li> The lid snapped when I was taking it off to add more qtips.</li>
    <li> Just received it today. Very simple, blends into the bathroom perfectly and is exactly what I expected. Easy to fill, easy to grab the Q-tips out, and its sanitary! You don&#x27;t have to touch the cotton ends to get the swabs out. Very Very please. In adding this dispenser I gain both cabinet space and a couple seconds every morning fresh out of the shower. Happy Shopping!</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep the Q-tips handy and neatly stored. It is hard to get the Q-tips in the holder neatly. The way the dispenser is pictured everything looks neat. I imagine this could be pulled off if you took a very long time to put the Q-tips in. I took 5 minutes and it is most certainly doesn&#x27;t look as pictured but it works and they for the most part free from dust. My stainless steel holder worked much better and it was just a cup like container with a lid.</li>
    <li> Item arrived and it appeared to have been previously open. The lid was broken from 2 different corners. I am very disappointed because I am not able to return the item due to the fact that it would cost me more money instead of saving money.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, but I would have preferred something a little more heavy duty. The lid especially is so light it pops off easily with any jostling. I guess you get what you pay for. The construction is pretty good considering how cheap and flimsy the material is.</li>
    <li> I was so glad when I came across this item!  It is very clear thick plastic and looks great on the bathroom counter.  No longer are my q-tips in a box in the cabinet.  These are easy to access one at a time keeping the rest sanitary.</li>
    <li> Lid is too flimsy, it was broken out of the box. Cotton swabs are very lightweight. After putting them in the cube, there&#x27;s nothing to push and hold them forward towards the slot. You try to get one out and it goes backwards and you end up trying to dig one out. Easier to leave the lid off and take one out of the top.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very useful. Don&#x27;t think its the product&#x27;s fault entirely but its hard to keep the swabs straight and organized. They get all tangled, doesn&#x27;t meet its purpose.</li>
    <li> I got this because it looked so nice and practical in the picture and i love an organized bathroom (and house...LOL..:)), it just makes life so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the box got here i was all excited that i didn&#x27;t even realize that it was broken. Once i took it out the box i noticed that it was actually broken and 2 plastic pieces from the lid were on the bottom of the box and that&#x27;s why i didn&#x27;t \\&quot;close/sit\\&quot; properly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is so cheap and \\&quot;plasticky\\&quot; that i do NOT have words to describe it and help you understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has potential but at this point all i can say is thankfully Amazon has a good return policy for situations like this and you save yourself a headache with just a few clicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip on the lid is useless because it so small that even a young child&#x27;s fingers would have trouble grabbing to lift of course i guess you can just pick up the whole lid to refill.</li>
    <li> I have used a small acrylic container with a flip-up top on it to store my Q-tips on my bathroom counter for years.  It was okay, but I found that having to flip open the top to grab the swabs was more of a pain than it was worth.  This holds far more Q-tips, doesn&#x27;t spill and is so much quicker and easier when grabbing a swab.  I will buy more - for baby gifts and for every bathroom!</li>
    <li> love this little q-tip container.it makes it so easy to get them out one at a time ,its very usefull</li>
    <li> It fits perfect in the medicine cabinet.  When looking it up online it does not give the dimensions which would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it may be a challenge to retrieve a q-tip if it is not in the container straight but it is not that difficult if you take your time.</li>
    <li> I love this product b/c it is inexpensive, Holds a good amount of Q-tips &amp; Looks great as a Plus. Very convenient to use. Love the Design.</li>
    <li> Love this dispenser. Perfect for rolling out q-tips&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t over load or they can get stuck. Easy to load and clean. Handy</li>
    <li> This thing looks nice on the counter and the q tips are SO easy to get out. I had no problem loading it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Meh. Not as amazing as I thought.</li>
    <li> they always get mixed up with the others and then don&#x27;t want to come out</li>
    <li> I cannot get the Q-Tips to lay flat.  I have tried loading them into the Qube in different ways with the same result each time:  Q-Tips going every which way.  I tried the suggestion of the one reviewer of cutting the bottom off the Q-Tip box and putting them in that way, but it did not work for me.  Even if I take the time to line them up initially, they get messed up when removing the individual Q-Tips.  It would look so much better and be easier to use if the Q-Tips would lay flat, but they won&#x27;t. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I want my Q-tips to be entirely covered allowing one at a time to be picked up,  and not exposed to dust and debris in the bathroom so although the tool works as designed; it is marginally difficult to fill, and the number of exposed tips lying in the tray exceeds my expectation.</li>
    <li> This is so not worth the price. If it wasn&#x27;t such a bother, I&#x27;d return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how Q-Tips come all lined up straight in the box?  Well, in order for this &amp;#34;dispenser&amp;#34; to work, that&#x27;s how you have to load them into it!!  The bottom falls out if you pick it up by the sides.  The Q-Tips don&#x27;t come out easily at all --- unless you&#x27;ve taken the time to line them up, one by one, to fill it.  Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> The QTips don&#x27;t really roll down smoothly. So it&#x27;s more hassle trying to first pour the Qtips in there so that it aligns in an organized pattern. Aint Nobody Got Time For That!</li>
    <li> It looks good but you need to make sure that once you can fill it with QTips you do not move it. Only pick it up by the base or it will come apart and empty your QTips all over the place. (this happened twice) Granted I know now but if you have children as I do.... tape it together (this takes away from the look) it comes in 3 peices and if you pick it up from the top or the middle it comes apart... only touch the base! Not easy to get the QTips in it and straightened to get them out thru the opening. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I thought I could do what the other reviewers recommended and use the back of the q-tip dispenser.  It doesn&#x27;t work as entropy reigns.  I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;3/31/2014.  I hate this thing more every time I refill it.  I lay awake at night thinking of how I&#x27;ve gone wrong, how inept I must be to be the only one that can&#x27;t make it work.  And then my thoughts turn dark: how best to rid myself of this piece of s***.  My current fantasy is fire in a silent room, listening for its screams.&lt;br /&gt;09/02/2014.  I finally threw it away.  I couldn&#x27;t take another refill.  RIP.</li>
    <li> it takes a while to stack the cotton swabs so that it despences properly. once you take the time to stack them it is a nice piece for the bathroom</li>
    <li> works good easy to use easy to fill and organized clear no instructions needed good price for the product its good for a nursery or anyone who likes things in there place</li>
    <li> The q-tips are hard to get from the bottom We have been grabbing from the top</li>
    <li> Very convenient.  Used to find this at Bed, Bath, Beyond but they stopped carrying it.  Checked out four stores, one in Hawaii and three in Vegas.  Amazon had it!  Some problems with the swabs getting tangled up.  They won&#x27;t look like the picture, for sure, but at least it only takes one hand to get it out to use.</li>
    <li> love it. i would recommend it. enjoy it. its very nice and look good as describ. i approve of it.</li>
    <li> This item meets my expectations, and will store the items appropriately. It is well constructed, and will help with my organization.</li>
    <li> Great, item.  I wear it over my shirts to work. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family and would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works ok, but you can&#x27;t fill it more than a few at a time because the cotton swabs get all tangled up and hard to get out.  This product is a good idea, but not designed well and is hard to use (have to fight to get a swab out more often than not).  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Works as described but need to line up and can have to yank to get one or two out.  If you are working in dirt and need about 10 of them for ears and nose better have a backup easier to get to!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, it is nearly impossible to load the cotton swabs in the dispenser in such as way that they dispense easily.  I have already loaded mine for the first time, so I can&#x27;t yet try the method recommended by the reviewer named Tickle, who gave the item 4 stars.</li>
    <li> this QubeTM Cotton Swab Dispenser by WalterDrake is perfect for keeping Q Tips nice and clean and the ends wound tight. looks great to, takes up LIITTLE room on counter or dresser or makeup stand!!</li>
    <li> The concept is great, because in theory you don&#x27;t have to touch the ends of the other Q-tip when getting out just one because it only dispenses one at a time, but it is very difficult to fill just right and get all of the Q-tips lined up the right direction.</li>
    <li> Actually it looked really handy in the picture.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews explaining how hard it is to refill it.  Not worth the bother.  Swabs in a jar make more sense.</li>
    <li> The package was torn and nearly open. The dispenser was fine.&lt;br /&gt;Did not find a packing slip.&lt;br /&gt;hope that it was not taken</li>
    <li> My son always steals q-tips from the drawer, and I have wanted a counter holder for a long time. I had a big order one day so I got it. *-My 9*6q-tips* DO NOT line up all pretty like in the picture. Its very annoying. I would have to load them 1-at-a-time to get that pretty stacked look. And they don&#x27;t easily come out (just one) without it tipping over. And the lid doesn&#x27;t snap on, so when it falls over it tips and a bunch fall out. Ruining any time I spent trying to make them line up nicely in there. Definitely looks better than it actually works, for me at least.</li>
    <li> If you take the time to load it works pretty good, every now and then you&#x27;ll get one that sticks but overall it is a clean way to organize and enhance your bathroom.</li>
    <li> Swabs don&#x27;t dispense out the bottom as designed.  Have to just lift the cheap top off to get at them.  Lame!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my container store thick acrylic box with a lid.  More sturdy.  More tidy.  More quiet too.</li>
    <li> This cotton swab dispenser has been a hit in my house so far.  I&#x27;m going to buy another one for our other bathroom.  It is useful for keeping cotton swabs available while still keeping a bathroom looking organized.  It&#x27;s easier to pick this thing up to wipe under it than our old glass jar.  Kid-friendly, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because loading was a bit of a hassel.  Even though I loaded the swabs carefully (which takes several minutes), they seem to come out of line after a few uses.  It&#x27;s not a big deal - function doesn&#x27;t stop, but I wish I could quickly grab the next swab without disrupting the ones behind it.</li>
    <li> I got this product in the mail in great timing ( only reason i gave 1 star) . But when i got the holder the top was creacked and the corner was chiped. The body of the holder was cracked all over!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, does exactly what it should.  You do have to be careful with how you load it.</li>
    <li> his arrived with lid chipped but still servicable. I like it and would have given 5 starts except for it arrived damaged.</li>
    <li> Swabs get stuck and don&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Does exactly what is says it does...looks nice on the vanity...easy to fill...keeps the q-tips clean and organized while out in the open...I love showcasing my q-tips...LOL!!</li>
    <li> the qube cottom swab dispenser is a great product. Its simple and easy to fill and pull out a cotton swab.</li>
    <li> this is great no more qtips all over the place simple compact fits on the sink without taking up too much space.</li>
    <li> Very time consuming to get the tips lined up so they would roll out &amp; instead ended up sending back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a testament to my apathy that I&#x27;ve owned this poorly designed product since November 2011 and only today decided I can&#x27;t take it anymore. I am buying this [[ASIN:B0000E1VQY Acrylic Cotton Ball and Swab Holder]] as a replacement. I can only repeat what others have said, which is that you will never get the cotton swabs to look as nicely lined up as in the product photo unless you have a lot of time on your hands and OCD tendencies. Shortly after buying, I starting leaving the top off since it takes seconds (those seconds never seemed so precious) to try pulling the swab out the bottom. You will never get the fuzzy-headed swabs to align so perfectly horizontal that they just slip out the bottom like smooth, plastic straws (and also because they are not in fact frictionless products.) I don&#x27;t even try lining up the swabs any more. I&#x27;ve degenerated to just tossing in a handful at a time, causing them to stick out every which way, including at awkward angles out the slot below.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it would be great, until I tried to put Qtips in and get them out. It was horrible. They don&#x27;t come out easily and get stuck. When trying to put Q tips in, its too small to properly align them. I would never get this again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for so long. I wanted a nice dispenser for my Q-tips without having to remove a lid everyday yet still have the Q-tips covered for sanitary reasons. I liked that the only Q-tip exposed in this would be the next one to come out. It is pretty hard to neatly stack the Q-tips in this dispenser so that it comes out easily but when it is done, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: not sure if people will like how difficult it is to refill the dispenser nicely to make the most use out of it.</li>
    <li> The Q-tips do not dispense vert well. We always have to take the lid off the top to get the q-tips out. But it loos nice.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy for what I thought it would be, but will do the trick for our bathroom.  I took one star off for that.  Other then that it does hold quite a bit of Q-tips.  I buy the 750 Q-tips from Walmart and i was able to fill this little container with about 1/4 of that box.  Then again, i literally stacked them in there nice and neat one by one..  lol.</li>
    <li> The lid falls off any time you bump the dispenser. It takes several tries to get a Q-tip out. My husband got so frustrated that he threw away the lid and now takes the Q-tips from the top. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Before you buy this product, ask yourself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Have you recently smashed a folding chair against the head of someone wearing nothing but a Speedo and a cape?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you saw a row of thirty of these items, perfectly filled, on a Lucite shelf against a white background, would your first instinct be to offer $30,000?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Is your ideal Saturday spent aligning small items so they are oriented identically on parallel planes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the answer to any of these questions was yes, this item is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expectation: The cube will be easy to fill with swabs. (The picture on the box shows a perfectly ordered cube of cotton swabs, with one swab dispensed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reality: The lid does allow full access to the interior of the cube, but In order to get the swabs aligned properly in the box, you must place them individually. No grabbing a handful from your box of a thousand and dropping them in. They will land crooked, tangle, and refuse to dispense. Found-object artists and the obsessive will have a great time filling this dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expectation: It will be easy to grab a single swab from the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reality: Even if a swab does dispense, it&#x27;s not necessarily easy to grab. If the swab is at all crooked, you may need to borrow a few moves from the WWF to wrassle it out. Often, a swab doesn&#x27;t dispense at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expectation: This item will become a bathroom counter-top staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reality: Mine chipped after one day of use, without being dropped or abused in any way except verbally. I expect it will not hold up at all when I finally give up and throw it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the sad, sad day (next Thursday) when I have to replace this item, I will look for a decorative jar or canister.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of this better then the real&lt;br /&gt;thing. Here&#x27;s the positives: it looks good on the&lt;br /&gt;counter, doesn&#x27;t take up alot of space, the price&lt;br /&gt;was really good, keeps them tidy, and keeps them&lt;br /&gt;clean and dust free. The not so positives: its&lt;br /&gt;kinda hard to keep them straight putting them in&lt;br /&gt;the container, its kinda hard to get them out. I&lt;br /&gt;am going to keep it as its the best thing I have&lt;br /&gt;found so far. I have OCPD and I can finally keep&lt;br /&gt;Q-tips on the counter.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this product. The only real problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s hard to get the qtips in perfectly straight so it works correctly. In fact I still haven&#x27;t found a way to do it without having to wiggle the qtips out through the little opening. But other than that, it&#x27;s stylish and I like it.</li>
    <li> The cotton swabs don&#x27;t come out of the box very easily as they don&#x27;t want to stay straight when I put them in the container.  I end up just opening the lid most of the time because its faster than trying to wrangle a swap out of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great concept, but the Q-tips do not in any way, shape, fashion or form stay lined up the way they need to, in order to dispense properly out of the slot at the bottom of the cute little box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will likely wind up just taking the top off and taking the Q-tips out through the top of the box.  Otherwise plan on spending an hour or so loading the q-tips in veeeeeery precisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a time saver.  (The little rocket-shaped pop-up swab dispenser reviewed in another post is a much better functioning device, if not as attractive.)</li>
    <li> Horrible. We use it just to store Q-tips because you can&#x27;t get them in there and lined up for them to work. I&#x27;m sorry but this product is bad.</li>
    <li> You have to load it very carefully and get them all laying flat so that they can come out if the small slit. I would not purchase this again. It is too much work.</li>
    <li> What I like. I can see if its getting low on Q-tips. Keeps dust and debris off the cotton tips. Whats bad. This is one of those products that I doubt the inventor ever used. Filling it is nerve racking. When you open a new Q-tip box, they are all nice and straight. When you try to transfer them to the Qube they get all criss crossed. No way to remove just one without a fight. So I filled it to the top one by one. This took over 40 minutes. Looked just like it was done by a machine. After only 3 were remove, they began to start the criss cross affect that yes, makes it impossible to remove one at a time. The Qube is also to lite for the work it takes to get one out. I glued a weight to the top and placed it on a sticky goo pad. Helps alot. As much as I dont like this product. There simply are no better option available, to me. I have tried others. I&#x27;ll keep it. Works best with only a few Q-tips in it, pushed to the back. then you can put your finger in opening, and control the way it exits. Crazy.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item over a year ago.  Still using it and loving&lt;br /&gt;the look on my bathroom countertop.  Thanks,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very cute style for the bathroom but I didn&#x27;t find it very functional. Unless you place each swab in there perfectly - not just in the same direction - but perfectly - it does not dispense properly. We still use it but have just opened up the top to get our cotton swabs out.</li>
    <li> I have another one like this made of stainless steel with a lil bigger mouth dispenser, it works for us really well.  I purchased this clear one for our other bathroom, it doesn&#x27;t work as much as my first one because it had a smaller dispensing hole, so what we usually do is open the top every time we grabbed the cotton buds...a lil hassle esp when the last person does not put the lid back on, tendency of losing it.</li>
    <li> This is great!  It keeps my quips safe and eliminates me having the trashy package around. It&#x27;s easy to load if you dump the package in carefully.</li>
    <li> All of the previous reviews for this item are accurate. It&#x27;s impossible to load the dispenser exactly like the picture even if you put each individual q tip in. I didn&#x27;t purchase this to dispense, I purchased it as a modern looking solution to having a box of q tips on the counter. I am able to to grab the q tips from the dispenser as intended, but they don&#x27;t roll out. The cotton on each q tip tends to stick to the others. Still a good product, but not the greatest &amp;#34;dispenser&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Like it.  For the price, it is very functional and attractive.  The swabs do tend to get a little tangled, but not too often. Pleased with item.</li>
    <li> Discreet and efficient.  A little on the cheap side, but does the trick.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work like a toothpick dispenser like I origionally thought it would. If I placed each one in separately and perfectly even then the qtips would no longer be sanitary. So I just lift the lid to get one out. I bought 4 because I just thought this was the coolest thing I have ever seen on Pinterest. Yes, someone posted this was sold on Amazon on a Pinterest page. Go figure.</li>
    <li> This thing is hard to fill. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s anything they can do to fix that, but if your Qtips get crooked, then the whole thing goes to crap when you&#x27;re trying to fill it up. Other than that, it works as advertised. I mean, it holds Qtips, it doesn&#x27;t cure cancer.</li>
    <li> This dispenser does not dispense..I find it necessary to remove the lid to get my qtip because they don&#x27;t stay in line to come out the bottom as they are supposed to. I did just as well with a round container where I lifted the lid off. This dispenser also comes apart when you lift the whole thing up and I&#x27;m very disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> This is a good looking, clean-line dispenser, but I really don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;re supposed to get the swabs in there in such a nice, neat way that they will actually easily dispense from the bottom. Very challenging.</li>
    <li> I guess maybe I am being picky but whoever set up the swabs in that picture must have had the patience of a saint. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to get your Q-tips in there straight and neat like the picture shows. I tried quite diligently but they still ended up crooked and hence they didn&#x27;t free flow out of there the way you&#x27;d imagine. It works ok, but sometimes I have to dig the things out and I accidentally pull our two or three in the process.</li>
    <li> This dispenser works. It&#x27;s hard to put all the swabs in there. My husband didn&#x27;t like it, so it became a playtoy for the kids.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of buying three of these, thinking they would come in handy at home and at work.  However, it&#x27;s impossible to fill the cube with cotton swabs so that they dispense correctly or at all.  This item is frustrating and near useless.  Now I just leave the lid off which makes it practically pointless as well.  I even tried to use it as a toothpick dispenser!!  The best part of owning this will likely be when I throw it away.</li>
    <li> The item arrived to met broken.</li>
    <li> It holds my qtips with style. They don&#x27;t fall out and it&#x27;s easy to refill it. Plus, since it&#x27;s clear, you know when it&#x27;s time to refill.</li>
    <li> HARD to get Q-tips lined up to be able to take out one at a time.....I just take the top off each time - ok alternative, but I was looking forward to getting one at a time from bottom/dispenser area</li>
    <li> Wish that I had read these reviews before I bought this. I too thought this should work just fine, but it doesn&#x27;t. The Q-tips don&#x27;t fall well, they become a jumbled up mess that you try to pry through, and eventually end up opening the top to get out. Really pointless and bad design in general. I should have bought the pop-up one like my Grandma had!!!</li>
    <li> Unless you get the cotton swabs perfectly&lt;br /&gt;In there straight, you will never get them out of the bottom and the product is useless</li>
    <li> Mine came with a broken lid.</li>
    <li> Impossible  to get the q-tips out of the bottom so I just open the top.  Also it is difficult to fill it .</li>
    <li> told my friends about this, it&#x27;s small, keeps it all organized for me. and it&#x27;s very stylish goes with just about any decorative design..</li>
    <li> I love the organizational aspect of this product; however, the cotton of the individual q-tips prevent the shifting of product down to the pick up slot. Perhaps this is because I buy cheep q-tips, but I don&#x27;t see how that would make a difference.</li>
    <li> This dispenser is great for storing cotton swabs on the bathroom counter.  It keeps them clean and they&#x27;re easy to grab just one at a time.  The only down side is that it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to get the swabs to line up nice and pretty (like in the picture).  But they still dispense as needed even when they aren&#x27;t lined up so well.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult, pretty much impossible to load swabs into it all perfectly.  They don&#x27;t cooperate with the dispenser slot either.  Just use a small basket or something pretty instead and stand the swabs up vertically.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly. Very convenient to access. Easy to refill. Perfect in bathroom and doesn&#x27;t require much space on counter.</li>
    <li> I like things to have there own place and to remain clean and this is what it does. Keeps my Q-tips clean and at my fingers tips.&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
    <li> Its IMPOSSIBLE to get the Qtips in the dispenser flat as pictured. What a waste! Another plastic piece if crap!</li>
    <li> Does not work smoothly. Have to fumble with the little notch to get the q-tip to drop out. Easier to lift the lid and take one out.</li>
    <li> Looks fine. Great idea. Holds plenty of cotton swabs. It looks like the swabbies fall right into place they don&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t had the patience to lay them in there so the look like the picture so they are a little onrey to get out our you can just take the top off.</li>
    <li> Been waiting for this product for ever!  Serves its purpose and works really well.  Convenient and easy to use.  No more spilled qtips from the box!</li>
    <li> Cotton swabs are difficult to get out and hard to load</li>
    <li> Perfect. Now, if only I can get the Q-Tips to lay straight in there. :-/</li>
    <li> Simple, accessible, easy to see when it needs to be refilled, quality plastic that won&#x27;t warp in time or weather changes.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you are a frequent swab user though because the swabs fit very snug in there and you have to load it almost one at a time.</li>
    <li> When I received this, the glass was cracked. It could have been tossed around when it was being shipped over, but it should have been protected better. Q-tips don&#x27;t go in the way they have it in the picture, and I basically take the lid off &amp; just grab q-tips from the top. It works to keep things organized instead of leaving a box of q-tips out.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of the Qube because I use a lot of q-tips, but this model isn&#x27;t perfect. My q-tips don&#x27;t fit into the container easily, so I have ended up just taking the top off and pulling them from there. The q-tips get jumbled up and won&#x27;t come out of the dispenser if they are not precisely placed inside the container. Overall, it&#x27;s a great idea, but too much time is wasted fitting the q-tips in the container properly.</li>
    <li> its a raely nice orgnizer for the cotton sewab  i love it&lt;br /&gt;its make the cotton swab easy to use</li>
    <li> i bought this thinking that it would keep my q-tips from ending up every where. you cant even get q-tips into it with out them flying everywhere. its also very hard to grab one at a time from the container. Corners of the lid were all starting to crack when it arrived</li>
    <li> It looks very attractive, however, when you load the Q-tips into it, they go in on all angles and are difficult to get a single Q-tip out.</li>
    <li> It works, but the swabs don&#x27;t slide out as easily I would like.  It looks good &amp; saves space too.</li>
    <li> My purchase came &amp;#34;per opened&amp;#34; , torn packing and all. That aside the lip of the lid is so narrow that it makes it VERY likely that the product will arrive chipped; regardless of packaging . Otherwise the concept is cool. Wish the execution was better. Good luck with your purchase if you decide to buy; It is a gamble.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cool design and a handy dispenser but if the swabs are not straight, it&#x27;s a daily puzzle to feta them out. Decent quality.</li>
    <li> How does a company design a product specifically to hold and dispense Q Tips without testing it to make sure Q Tips can actually be loaded in and dispensed? I tried multiple methods to get the Q Tips in and finally channeled my inner OCD and put them in one-by-one! The first time my cat knocked the darn thing over when it was half-way full! The second time I was successful but as soon as I moved it to the shelf the Q Tips shifted and don&#x27;t dispense properly. Cool name, poor design.</li>
    <li> I could hardly wait to get this nifty product. It looked like the most amazing gadget ever- how did I ever live without one? Well I wished I would have just kept my money and stuck my cotton swabs in an empty pickle jar.  This thing is junk. It does not work right- since it does not actually dispense without a fair bit of muscle and anger directed at product (and the lid does not fit correctly )we remove our swabs from the top. Once ours is empty I am going to leave it on the doorstep of someone I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Well in a picture looks amazing, but is not easy to fill it up lol. I&#x27;m trying to fill it up like the picture, but for that I think you need to put them one by one.</li>
    <li> Unless you place each of your Qtips in the cube with precision and care, this dispenser with become a jumbled mess. I like things orderly, But I will not spend an hour arranging my Qtips.</li>
    <li> WAY too much work to get them in place to avoid tangles, and they don&#x27;t drop down like you&#x27;d think they should. Just not worth the hassle, although it looked nice. I&#x27;ll just leave the qtip box out and will be sending these in the charity donation pile.</li>
    <li> Looks great on the bathroom counter and all the kids can get QTips without digging in the box.</li>
    <li> q-tips get stuck sideways and it doesn&#x27;t work right so your always having to open the lid to fix it...</li>
    <li> Hard to fill, the swabs tend to  fall out easily.</li>
    <li> While this is a good product for storing your Q-Tips without having to keep the box the Q-Tips originally come in, it is just ok for ease-of use.  The Q-Tips did not go in straight and upon shaking to try to get them aligned with the Dispenser, only created more of a problem.  It does not dispense properly and the tip popped off and is no longer useful.</li>
    <li> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;IqQCYa6v98s&amp;feature&#x3D;youtube_gdata_player&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews were too mixed so I made a youtube video showing how I stocked it and pulled the Q tips out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice that I did not fully stocked it or it would be too difficult to pull a Q tip out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technique of how to take one is just like a toothpick OR sometimes vertically. Over time it gets kinda messy so occasionally you have to fiddle with it to get it right. I don&#x27;t find this to be a hassle because normally it&#x27;s a little fight to get one out of a box or bag when it gets too messy too.</li>
    <li> I well and truly wish I had gone with a proven, simple solution, instead of an undeveloped, complicated one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike toothpicks, cotton swabs do not line-up neatly.  Filling this container is anything but simple and it works reliably on rare occasions.  Much of the time, you&#x27;re fighting to wrestle one swab out of the grips of it&#x27;s brethren, as if it&#x27;s a bucket of crabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe some more time should have been spent on the product, instead of the marketing.  I want solutions to problems, not additional problems.</li>
    <li> Got it quik Very useful</li>
    <li> First of all, the lid does not snap or fasten into place at all.  Instead, it simply sets on top of the cube. So, if it falls the lid will pop off and the swabs will fly out, making a mess.  Secondly, as many other reviewers have noted, the swabs do not line up very well, and end up being clumped and tangled.  The only positive thing that I can add is that the plastic is very clear. Unfortunately it is also quite thin and feels weak, even brittle.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because this product really belongs in the half-price bargain bin at the local dollar store.  I will be looking for a better solution for storing my swabs.</li>
    <li> horrible. Great idea but very poorly made.  Difficult to place cotton swabs in dispenser.</li>
    <li> ...to the other reviews.  It really is difficult to dispense the Q-tips as they are intended with this item.  We gave up after 2 days and just took the lid off and reach in to get the swabs.</li>
    <li> This is a good idea for a product, however, it takes a bit to get the q-tips out unless you can line them up PERFECTLY in this cube. I tried three times to line them up perfectly, and finally gave up. I will move it to the guest bathroom until I get a different container for q-tips.</li>
    <li> I like the dispenser. It arrived early with a few other items. It is a little hard to get the q-tips out of the bottom so I just open the top. Maybe I just expected something else. It is a much better way of storing the q-tips than in the box they come in. It looks much nicer and cleaner. Overall, I like this product but I might eventually get something different.</li>
    <li> I really love the looks and how easy it is to get a Q-tip out of this dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a lid to cover them from dust and to re-fill it; However, it is nearly impossible to re-fill it in a short amount of time, it&#x27;s time consuming and annoying but I guess it&#x27;s worth it as is not an often task.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The q tips do not go in nicely as pictured and the lid came chipped with my order.</li>
    <li> It is very attractive sitting on the counter, now...when it arrived the lid had a piece broken off of it, this must have happened in the suppliers warehouse, the defect is in the back toward the wall so it&#x27;s invisible.  Filling is aggravating and takes considerable time, if you don&#x27;t place about 5 at a time in it and make sure they are flat it is very difficult to get them out from the dispenser.  I may go back to the box in a drawer.</li>
    <li> The box should have been about 1/16&amp;#34; wider. The swabs just fit inside, they touch the side. This defeats the purpose of a gravity feeder, the swabs do not like to drop by themselves, you need to reach in and pull it because they touch the side of the dispenser. The bottom came broken off so I had to glue it back together not a concern but the dispensing action is terrible. I should have opted for a jar instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this, thinking it would be easy to pull the q-tips out and keep the rest sanitary.  However, I&#x27;ve found that I have to load this thing one or two q-tips at a time to have a chance of them being pulled out easily.  If you&#x27;re set on buying this, read through the comments to get hints for reloading.  Otherwise, if you&#x27;re looking for something simple, go with a different product.  If the q-tips are askew in this thing, they are a pain to pull out of the bottom because they get stuck.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think this Cotton Swab Dispenser would be easy to use.  I mean how could a simple square block design be difficult to grab a swab from, right??!!  (rolling eyes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t figured it out yet as to why this happens, but for some strange reason, no matter how slowly and specifically you fill the dispenser with your Q-Tips, they do not fall down smoothly to the grabbing slot (where you&#x27;d reach to get the next one in line).  They get all crossed up and mangled inside the dispenser, which prevents them from moving downward.  My husband and I just end up opening the lid at the top to access one.  We now have it in the Guest Bedroom, which looks nice and clean, but guests just can&#x27;t access them.  HA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return this because it certainly does NOT do what it says it does in the description, but that&#x27;s more of a hassle than it&#x27;s worth.  I am considering ordering the Pop Up Cotton Swab Dispenser.</li>
    <li> bf loves his qtips but i hated seeing the whole box of qtips and wanted to tuck it away into something cute but this thing is just a lil too annoying to refill to give anything more than 3 stars for me :/</li>
    <li> I bought this product so I could keep my Q-tips clean and organize. The picture looks better than it actually works, we all know that Q-tip stick together and as you pull them out they do not stay as organize as we would like. Especially when you have multiple people trying to use the dispenser and get frustrated with it. But I do recommend this product it does work.</li>
    <li> Works well, keeps items clean and neat.  Holds a lot of q tips.  Will consider purchasing another for second bath.</li>
    <li> Little time to load it, but like the sleek look! Don&#x27;t waste the cotton swaps we once did. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this gadget.  It is so easy to use and is a classy lil gadget to place just about anywhere in your home.</li>
