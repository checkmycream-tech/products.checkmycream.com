      <li>They really are the best pins.  </li>
      <li>I was okay with the resolution</li>
      <li>Seems like a better deal, until you get it in the mail</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had and of them chip on top, though, just on the inside.</li>
      <li>just ordered two more packs.  </li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this order.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d be receiving so many</li>

      <li>and I was not disappointed!  </li>
      <li>oh and try to combine with another super saver shipping product or whatever and have it ship free!,</li>
      <li>Not only was did the price win me over</li>
      <li>This was such a great buy for the price and amount you get.</li>
      <li>I got my 12 packs for ~$9 with free shipping.</li>
      <li>These hold nicely but the black coating peels very easily and ends up stuck in my hair.</li>
      <li>its definatley worth it.</li>
      <li>(it cost me about the same as going to buy them at a beauty supply store), but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the \\&quot;84% discount\\&quot; being flouted here.</li>

      <li>Great heavy duty bobby pins!  </li>

      <li>They were so cheap that I won&#x27;t send them back</li>
      <li>all haha.</li>

      <li>It shipped so fast</li>
      <li>I would love it if they came in dark brown</li>
      <li>Bobby pins are like clothespins, in that you think they are all pretty much the same until you get some duds.</li>
      <li>There are so many it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.</li>
      <li>I purchased the product from Amazon.com directly</li>
      <li>They can be loose, flimsy, and cheap - not worth buying at any price.     </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big, its loud and it needs to be tamed.</li>
      <li>I dont feel bad losing any because I have so many to spare!!</li>
      <li>I have a head of African American natural hair.</li>
      <li>The good news is you get a ton of bobby pins for the money!&lt;br /&gt;The bad news</li>

<li> For the price, I can definitely live with this slight drawback.</li>
<li> However, other sellers are selling single packs and such under the same title for ~$2 for ~$2 shipping.</li>
<li> I been looking for this sooooo long, now I can style my hair the way I wanted and there are plenty of it</li>
<li> Some of the other dealers here sell under the same title, but do not send 12 packs.</li>
<li> Other than that I constantly find them on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The only downfall is that the coating comes off of them sometimes, but that has only happened a few times out of hundreds.</li>
<li> I loose bobby pins like nobodies business, and now i can&#x27;t imagine i&#x27;ll have to buy any for a long time!</li>
<li> They grip very tight but the drawback is that the paint comes off very quickly especially if you are criss-crossing them.</li>
<li> would give the product and price 5 stars, but until Amazon fixes the other seller of this item, I will give it 3 stars for its scam qualities.</li>
<li> (like I have bought before in other brands).</li>
<li> I ordered these bobby pins to put my hair into funky updos and to get that one curl to stay down...</li>
<li> I thought they would hold a little better than the conair ones, a little disappointed</li>
<li> after 2 uses, the black paint coating from the length of the pins as well as the tips were coming off all over my hands and hair.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t deduct any points for that, since they are supposed to be black.</li>
<li> is the black paint coating flakes off :</li>
<li> When I opened the box there were black flakes of paint everywhere.  </li>
<li> I know they also sell bronze ones, but the tips look yellow and that would look worse than the black.     </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s way less expensive to buy these bobby pins online than to go to the store and buy individual packs of pins.&lt;br</li>
<li> but I am pretty disappointed in the quality :/</li>
<li> I have thick &amp; slick hair and if the pins are flimsy they get bent out of shape, they twist, they fall out, etc.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I failed to mention that I have lost every single bobby pin i have ever owned up until</li>
<li> Quantity is not worth it for terrible quality!</li>
<li> Absolutely Terrible!!!</li>
<li> Disgusting and terrible!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> they are comparable to conair bobby pins...I thought they would hold a little better than the conair ones, a little disappointed</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this! Great price and quality. I loose bobby pins like nobodies business, and now i can&#x27;t imagine i&#x27;ll have to buy any for a long time!</li>
    <li> I was recommended these bobbypins on a hairstyle blog and I was not disappointed!  They are not flimsy and have excellent hold.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are great.  I needed to purchase a lot of them to add them to my care packages and these work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered two more packs.  That should hold me for awhile.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this order. Not only did it come on time but there are just so many bobby pins which makes it harder to lose them all haha. Great item and will be ordering again soon.</li>
    <li> The product describes that you&#x27;ll receive 60 bobby pins, per pack ... and that there are 12 of them, a 12-pack. I received one (1) pack only.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product from Amazon.com directly so I received 12 packs of 60 Bobby Pins. Some of the other dealers here sell under the same title, but do not send 12 packs. You will notice their prices are must lower than amazon&#x27;s price. I got my 12 packs for ~$9 with free shipping. However, other sellers are selling single packs and such under the same title for ~$2 for ~$2 shipping. Seems like a better deal, until you get it in the mail and it is not a 12 pack.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, all bobby pins are cheaply made. These bobby pins are no different. Now that my wife has 720 of them for under $10, we will not have to worry about them for along time. Other than that I constantly find them on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I would give the product and price 5 stars, but until Amazon fixes the other seller of this item, I will give it 3 stars for its scam qualities.</li>
    <li> These were recommended by a hair stylist blogger.  They really are the best pins.  They stay in so much better than the ones you buy at discount stores.  This box will last me forever!</li>
    <li> Not only was did the price win me over but the quality is great! It shipped so fast and it was even combined with another order. I did the math lol and got 720 bobby pins for like [...] bucks..what a deal! you would pay like atleast [...] for one pack that would only come with like 40. When I run out, which shouldnt be soon I will definatley order again!! order now!! its definatley worth it. oh and try to combine with another super saver shipping product or whatever and have it ship free!, another plus! thats what I did.</li>
    <li> Bobby pins are like clothespins, in that you think they are all pretty much the same until you get some duds. They can be loose, flimsy, and cheap - not worth buying at any price.     These pins are pretty sturdy. I lose bobby pins all the time. I have thick &amp; slick hair and if the pins are flimsy they get bent out of shape, they twist, they fall out, etc. I haven&#x27;t had issues with these, they stay put.     I would love it if they came in dark brown (like I have bought before in other brands). I can&#x27;t deduct any points for that, since they are supposed to be black. I know they also sell bronze ones, but the tips look yellow and that would look worse than the black.     And, just because I like to complain, I would like to add that the paint chips and they are silver underneath. I haven&#x27;t had and of them chip on top, though, just on the inside. So I&#x27;m not deducting any points from that, either. Just a heads up.</li>
    <li> I dont think I will need to buy bobby pins ever again. This was such a great buy for the price and amount you get. I dont feel bad losing any because I have so many to spare!! The only downfall is that the coating comes off of them sometimes, but that has only happened a few times out of hundreds. I dont regret this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> after 2 uses, the black paint coating from the length of the pins as well as the tips were coming off all over my hands and hair.  Disgusting and terrible!  I would take it out of my hair and see film in my hair and on my hands.  Cheap, and poorly made.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Quantity is not worth it for terrible quality! I tried some from each section and they are all the same. Absolutely Terrible!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set, assuming that I would be getting 12 cards of 60 bobby pins each (that&#x27;s what 12-pack means, right?)  I received them today, and it was only one card of 60 pins.  When I called and spoke with a customer service rep he offered to let me keep the pins and reimburse me for the cost of the product, but not the shipping, and I could keep the pins.  I was okay with the resolution (it cost me about the same as going to buy them at a beauty supply store), but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the \\&quot;84% discount\\&quot; being flouted here.</li>
    <li> These hold nicely but the black coating peels very easily and ends up stuck in my hair. This happened on the same day I received them.</li>
    <li> So many bobby pins!  These are the best - great hold!</li>
    <li> Excellent value and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> I was worried about not getting the 12 pack but it was good. My sister in law loved the gift and she has plenty of bobby pins for a while.</li>
    <li> I have a head of African American natural hair. It&#x27;s big, its loud and it needs to be tamed. I ordered these bobby pins to put my hair into funky updos and to get that one curl to stay down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I failed to mention that I have lost every single bobby pin i have ever owned up until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this pack of pins over 2 years ago and i am still using the same ones. There are so many it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous. It&#x27;s way less expensive to buy these bobby pins online than to go to the store and buy individual packs of pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll ever run out! But if i do, i know where to turn.</li>
    <li> I been looking for this sooooo long, now I can style my hair the way I wanted and there are plenty of it</li>
    <li> Great heavy duty bobby pins!  Hold my heavy/corse hair without having to use dozens.  I didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d be receiving so many (it&#x27;s a 12 pack with 60 on a card) so for the price this is a bargain and I will never have to buy bobby pins again!</li>
    <li> This is essentially buying a lifetime supply of bobby pins. I mostly use them for clipping back my bangs. They grip very tight but the drawback is that the paint comes off very quickly especially if you are criss-crossing them. I still get a lot of uses out of them but at some point the rounded nubs come off so I have to throw them away or poke at my scalp with the metal ends. For the price, I can definitely live with this slight drawback. I bought this 2 years ago and haven&#x27;t yet gone through one paper package of them.</li>
    <li> The good news is you get a ton of bobby pins for the money!&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is the black paint coating flakes off :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received these pins in the mail yesterday so I haven&#x27;t even used them.  When I opened the box there were black flakes of paint everywhere.  I slid off a couple of the pins and they were already flaking without having ever been used.  They were so cheap that I won&#x27;t send them back but I am pretty disappointed in the quality :/</li>
