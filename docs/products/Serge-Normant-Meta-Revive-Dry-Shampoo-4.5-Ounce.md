      <li>Smells amazing too! :)</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>To be fair, I do have very fine hair, so maybe that was part of the problem.  </li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo and smells so good!</li>
      <li>It works well and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>The cedar bark smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it smells AMAZING</li>
      <li>this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product and recommend it 100%.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it adds volume and allows me to maintain my color longer.  </li>
      <li>I did much better when I used it again.  </li>
      <li>I must say, I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>There are so many better choices at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>Would be better off saving your money.</li>
      <li>After watching Oprah soooo many months (years)</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I have blondish hair, so I can blend it easily, but for your brunettes out there....</li>
      <li>The difference it makes in my hair is so remarkable that my roommate notices nearly every time I use it and talks about wanting a can for herself.</li>
      <li>Adds weight to fine hair...</li>
      <li>Light scent, doesn&#x27;t make my hair too sticky.  </li>
      <li>My hair was left clean and I got great body, made styling easy.  </li>
      <li>It definately soaks up the oil and leaves my hair smelling very fresh.</li>
      <li>I love dry shampoo and am always on the lookout for a good one.  </li>
      <li>WELL, it was worth its weight in GOLD!  </li>
      <li>makes hair clean but doesn&#x27;t add any body.  </li>
      <li>I will find out when I order a full size here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>But once I figured out how to use it, I realized that not only does it smell nice and absorb oil, it also gives my fine hair lots of volume--for this reason, I sometimes even use it on clean hair.</li>
      <li>It does the job quickly and provides a lot of body to the hair.  </li>
      <li>I received a sample of this dry shampoo from Birchbox and loved it.</li>
      <li>-- I was willing to shell over the $25 bucks!</li>
      <li>The main thing I would tell a friend is to go easy on it.  </li>
      <li>It does provide body, but it certainly does not provide a clean feeling to your roots.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve used many other dry shampoos successfully.  </li>
      <li>I was pretty upset, as it ruined my hair for the night</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have tried many dry shampoos, from suave, Oscar blandi, ojon,</li>
      <li>it would perform better than the $6 dry shampoo by Clairol called \\&quot;Pssst\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Applying too much can certainly create a gray-hair disaster; it&#x27;s one of those beauty products with a learning curve, like liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several cheap (Psst, Suave, Dove) and not-so-cheap (Oscar Blandi)</li>
      <li>They come through for me in a pinch when I have to delay a shower and need to get ready in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found my absolute favorites to be suave and pssst (which you can get at ulta and sephora I believe).</li>
      <li>or I used too much....</li>
      <li>can really help set it.  </li>
      <li>The can seemed to run out fast</li>
      <li>I have very fine, slightly damaged magenta hair.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend this to anyone, it creates more of a mess than any time it saves from washing and styling.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>For me, it was worth the cost, as one can lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I have also recently tried the Suave Dry Shampoo that is less than $3 at Wal-Mart and found it to be superior to this over-priced item I purchased on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>and she knows I am a huge fan of dry shampoos (I only wash my hair twice a week).    </li>
      <li>So this product is great to build volume but not a great dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>The only other dry shampoo I like is Suave dry shampoo and plain old baby powder, but this product is definitely worth the $25 price tag because it really does give great results and totally matifies the oil in your hair, restoring volume and allowing you to restyle it without it getting greasy again.    </li>
      <li>In the areas where I was able to get a thorough brushing done my hair looks like some sort of stiff, grey powdered nest.</li>
      <li>Even after letting the product dry for 5 minutes instead of the recommended 2 before brushing out my hair I found it very clumpy and sticky.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use near as much as you do with other products and stays in your hair well.  </li>
      <li>Dries clear (no white residue) and adds volume</li>
      <li>spray roots only and WOW.</li>
      <li>On days when I dont need as much oil contol I use Klorane as my other go to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used baby powder (great in a pinch) but doesnt clean only gets rid of obvious oily hair, bumble and bumble (terrible)</li>

<li> The Serge Normant product left my hair feeling very dirty and like I should immediately shampoo it rather than being able to wait to the next day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So this product is great to build volume but not a great dry shampoo. I have very thick hair and it made my hair feel horrible. Like I said it you need volume this is great.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004W2S6YO Serge Normant Meta Revive Dry Shampoo with Cedar Bark]]    I am extremely disappointed in this product.  Julia Roberts on the Oprah show had mentioned this as one of her \\&quot;favorites\\&quot;!    I thought perhaps because it had her endorsement it would perform better than the $6 dry shampoo by Clairol called \\&quot;Pssst\\&quot;.  What a mistake.  The Serge Normant product left my hair feeling very dirty and like I should immediately shampoo it rather than being able to wait to the next day. The product also left my hair feeling very heavy.   I will NEVER buy this product again and really wish I could recover my wasted $25!    I have also recently tried the Suave Dry Shampoo that is less than $3 at Wal-Mart and found it to be superior to this over-priced item I purchased on Amazon.com.  (Please note this does note mean I have a problem with Amazon.com - just the item I choose to purchse.)    Hopefully, this will help anyone else from wasting their hard earned dollars!</li>
    <li> I write a fashion and beauty blog and I review a lot of products.  My mother in law actually got this for me because she saw it on Oprah and she knows I am a huge fan of dry shampoos (I only wash my hair twice a week).    I must say, I absolutely LOVE this product. It works well and smells amazing. I recently went away for the weekend where I spent time in the sun and on a boat and I used this in my hair that I hadn&#x27;t washed in days and no one could believe I hadn&#x27;t washed it!    The only other dry shampoo I like is Suave dry shampoo and plain old baby powder, but this product is definitely worth the $25 price tag because it really does give great results and totally matifies the oil in your hair, restoring volume and allowing you to restyle it without it getting greasy again.    I absolutely love this product and recommend it 100%. By the way---here is the photo where I used this product---this is my 5th DAY hair---I had used this dry shampoo for the last 2 days prior to having taken this photo: [...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used baby powder (great in a pinch) but doesnt clean only gets rid of obvious oily hair, bumble and bumble (terrible) the color never matches and it does nothing for your hair and Oscar blandi (not so bad) makes hair clean but doesn&#x27;t add any body.  I bought the Serge Normant travel size from Barney&#x27;s Dept Store before a trip and really loved it.  Sprayed it in, let it sit for 2 minutes then shook it out.  My hair was left clean and I got great body, made styling easy.  It actually worked so well I realized I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week using this everyday.  That&#x27;s actually not what I intended so I do make myself wash my hair at least every 4 days.  The can seemed to run out fast but that&#x27;s probably because I was using it everyday or I used too much....I will find out when I order a full size here on Amazon.  Think I&#x27;m gonna try the Sheer Dry Finishing Oil recommended because dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t address frizz on my ends.</li>
    <li> I have no issue with Amazon or this seller -- just this product. I have dark brown hair and every other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried has left a white chalky powder in my roots that looks terrible. When I saw that Julia Roberts endorsed this -- and she has dark brown hair too -- I was willing to shell over the $25 bucks! What a disappointment when I found that it not only left a chalky white powder, but when I tried to brush it out according to the directions on the can, it left white flaky clumps that looked like a massive case of danderuff. Ick.</li>
    <li> I hated this the first time I used it the same way I would a cheaper dry shampoo.  I tried it again using less and was still frustrated UNTIL i turned the blow dryer on to my roots and poof - amazing results.  Yes - your hair will still be a bit sticky but for any \\&quot;styled\\&quot; look this can really help set it.  Volume in the roots lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I bought this dry shampoo from Amazon.com after seeing Julia Roberts review it on a talk show.  The main thing I would tell a friend is to go easy on it.  A little goes a long way!  I&#x27;m used to cheaper brands.  With Serge Normant a couple sprays is enough.  It does the job quickly and provides a lot of body to the hair.  I did much better when I used it again.  For me, it was worth the cost, as one can lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> After watching Oprah soooo many months (years) ago, I remember seeing Julia Roberts recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I finally bit the bullet and ordered this....its kinda pricey compared to others on the market.  WELL, it was worth its weight in GOLD!  You don&#x27;t have to use near as much as you do with other products and stays in your hair well.  My only compliant, its white!  I have blondish hair, so I can blend it easily, but for your brunettes out there.... I am not sure if it would work for you.</li>
    <li> i did not like it. it seemed to stay heavy in my hair. easier to just wash. just not for me, but others may like.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after seeing a review in Elle. Never again. Yes, it smells AMAZING but it stays white in your hair! What good is that? Doesn&#x27;t even brush out. Would be better off saving your money.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this dry shampoo from Birchbox and loved it. I&#x27;ve tried several cheap (Psst, Suave, Dove) and not-so-cheap (Oscar Blandi) dry shampoos and this is by far the best. Applying too much can certainly create a gray-hair disaster; it&#x27;s one of those beauty products with a learning curve, like liquid eyeliner. But once I figured out how to use it, I realized that not only does it smell nice and absorb oil, it also gives my fine hair lots of volume--for this reason, I sometimes even use it on clean hair. The difference it makes in my hair is so remarkable that my roommate notices nearly every time I use it and talks about wanting a can for herself. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Im a hairstylist and this is quite a find! Delicious! Adds weight to fine hair...spray roots only and WOW. Most of these sprays smell horrible. You get volume fresh look and great fragrance! 5 star find!</li>
    <li> I love dry shampoo and am always on the lookout for a good one.  The Serge Normant Meta Revive Dry Shampoo did NOT fit the bill.  It turned my hair into a grey, greasy, tangled mess.  To be fair, I do have very fine hair, so maybe that was part of the problem.  But I&#x27;ve used many other dry shampoos successfully.  Sorry, I have to suggest you save your money and not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this product was awful . There are so many better choices at a fraction of the cost. Suave and Dove are both great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other dry shampoos that have worked wonders.  They come through for me in a pinch when I have to delay a shower and need to get ready in a hurry.  I saw this brand recommended on Oprah and tried it.  It does not perform nearly as well as other brands.  Leaves a sticky residue in my hair and leaves my hair limp and weighted down.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It makes hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> Light scent, doesn&#x27;t make my hair too sticky.  Dries clear (no white residue) and adds volume I didn&#x27;t know I could have.</li>
    <li> I received a large size sample of this product from Birchbox which I&#x27;ll never use up as I absolutely hated this product. It has great distribution via the aerosol can it comes in but has a very strong fragrance that does not fade. Even after letting the product dry for 5 minutes instead of the recommended 2 before brushing out my hair I found it very clumpy and sticky. In the areas where I was able to get a thorough brushing done my hair looks like some sort of stiff, grey powdered nest. I would not recommend this to anyone, it creates more of a mess than any time it saves from washing and styling.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry shampoos, from suave, Oscar blandi, ojon, whatever. I&#x27;ve found my absolute favorites to be suave and pssst (which you can get at ulta and sephora I believe). I also like batiste. I received serge in my birch box. The only thing I can compliment it on is that it adds volume.. Good for poofs. Other than that, it does not make your hair feel any less greasy and it turned my pretty brown hair grey brown. It also made it a weird texture. I was pretty upset, as it ruined my hair for the night and I couldnt wash it out. Gross. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s crap compared to other dry shampoos. Get suave, pssst, or batiste. Anything but this.</li>
    <li> The only dry shampoo you will ever need!</li>
    <li> 3/4 times i use this product, it leaves it sticky and heavy. It feels like spraying hair spray on your roots. It does provide body, but it certainly does not provide a clean feeling to your roots.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have white hair and adds volume. Love this!!! Smells amazing too! :)</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo and smells so good!</li>
    <li> I use this in between washings.  I have very fine, slightly damaged magenta hair.  I love this product because it adds volume and allows me to maintain my color longer.  The cedar bark smells amazing.  Too bad I bought mine at Nordstrom for twenty five dollars; I could have saved ten dollars on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo. I have thin hair so it adds a lot of volume and control to may hair after it is applied. I usually apply this product on the third day of no shampooing. It definately soaks up the oil and leaves my hair smelling very fresh. It may be too tacky or heavy for some peoples liking. On days when I dont need as much oil contol I use Klorane as my other go to.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used. It recreates my style for at least 1-2 days. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I could understand the negative reviews, but you have to follow the directions. There is a learning curve. I use it after a Keratin treatment (not allowed to wash hair for 72 hours) took some practice, but it works beautifully. The powder should be shaken out of hair after you wait a few minutes and it works beautifully when sprayed on scalp and roots.</li>
    <li> Really bad product left a thick layer of white sticky powder on my hair I looked like I aged 20 years and people were asking what happened to my hair! Terrible I will throw them away.</li>
    <li> It does leave a lot of white powder in the hair after applying. Also, it makes my hair very hard.</li>
