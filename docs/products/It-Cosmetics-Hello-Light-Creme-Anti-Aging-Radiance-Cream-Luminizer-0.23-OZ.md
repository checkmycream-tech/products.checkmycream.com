      <li>Loving how this highlights so nice:) ~~ Really helps with a nice overall face-look!  </li>
      <li>I bought this highlighter because I am a huge fan of it</li>

      <li>Sometimes I will also add some just under my eyebrows to help reflect light all around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Smooth cream like consistency.</li>
      <li>would have never discovered this fabulous product until it was recommended by the blogger - Maskcara.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I will also add some just under my eyebrows to help reflect light all around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light creamy gel-like stuff in feeling.  </li>
      <li>I wish it had staying power because the color is very pretty and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I use one quick layer of eyeshadow in light colors and do not use the darker colors for creases at all, nor any eye liners, since they seem to pronounce any around-the-eye darkness.  </li>
      <li>I was super excited to get this product in the mail and</li>
      <li>A creamy, good quality product that adds something extra to the face.  </li>
      <li>It reflects light without glitter, giving you a fresh, dewy, appearance.  </li>
      <li>Added a nice glowy look to my fair skin, not a shiny slick like some do.  </li>
      <li>What I like best is that it is subtle and works without specks of glitter.</li>
      <li>Gives the face a very soft glow appropriate for day or evening.  </li>
      <li>HONESTLY NOT CRAZY ABOUT IT...</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of highlighting without looking glitzy or shiny.</li>
      <li>I use a quick brush of light mineral powder swept over the top to help set it and even out any odd under-eye skin tones still</li>

      <li>This product is more hype than actual anti-aging cream...</li>
      <li>product could also be used as a mildly-shiny lip gloss or a gel-like eyeshadow to reflect light but remain mostly natural toned.</li>
      <li>This is very soft, so soft you may not be able to see it.  </li>
      <li>With many highlighters, you end up looking very obviously doctored-up and face-painted because the stuff glitters too much.  </li>
      <li>I put it on and it seems to come off pretty fast.  </li>
      <li>It makes you look radiant without being too much,I really like it,would recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>then use a stippling brush to gently blend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Provides a  very sheen glow with no glitter.</li>
      <li>The end result is that it reflects light and adds a &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; look to your face without it being so obvious that you&#x27;re faking it.  </li>
      <li>Does not show on skin very well or stay on.</li>
      <li>It does not take much of this highlighter at all.  </li>
      <li>(light swipe above my cheek bones, at my jaw line and on my chin) and sometimes as an eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>Very moist highlighter.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Soft Silky goes on smoothly light natural look without looking cakey.</li>
      <li>I was expecting maybe a very soft, very light somewhat pink shimmer.  </li>
      <li>A brown instead of black mascara, very lightly applied.  </li>
      <li>Very nice product, but a little goes a very long way.</li>
      <li>I wanted more of a subtle look as many products make you white, too shiny or have a color tent to them.</li>
      <li>I really like it for my mature skin.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to firmly close the compact after each use...</li>
      <li>This is the first and only creme illuminator that is creamy and will glide on even when useing a brush.</li>
      <li>This product works for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Gives a natural glow.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy, so make sure you apply it thinly...</li>
      <li>product could also be used as a mildly-shiny lip gloss or a gel-like eyeshadow to reflect light but remain mostly natural toned.-ish under my eyes, from nose around to just past eyes on the sides.  </li>
      <li>Most highlighter type of cosmetics come in tiny little packages as though intended to be used only as eye shadow.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It gives a nice highlight.&lt;br /&gt;For a cream product it feels like it has a slight (very slight) texture to it....</li>
      <li>Apparently, I&#x27;m glowing with maternal radiance</li>
      <li>First, for any really dark spots under my eyes, I use a concealer stick if needed.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very greasy and the color or lack of it is odd.</li>
      <li>After multiple uses I do not think this product effectively illuminates, it is a little too subtle for me and only makes me appear oily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As highlighters go this is not that good.  I wish it had staying power because the color is very pretty and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I wanted to love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a cream highlighter, but I wish it was creamier.&lt;br /&gt;The color is lovely and the packaging is nice and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a nice highlight.&lt;br /&gt;For a cream product it feels like it has a slight (very slight) texture to it.... I will use it, but will keep looking for a creamier option before I get more.</li>
    <li> I like to use it under my eyes and in the corners of my eyes. Sometimes use it on top of my cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;But go easy, too much makes it look bad</li>
    <li> My Elf highlighter, cream blush whatever, works way better and I only use a tiny drop which I blend with a little bit of foundation or moisturizer :o)</li>
    <li> Use this product to highlight your eyes and cheeks.  Very moist highlighter. Compact has a nice mirror so it is great for every day in your purse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and the color or lack of it is odd. I was expecting maybe a very soft, very light somewhat pink shimmer.  It went on greasy and colorless.  Very odd looking.  I didn&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this highlighter because I am a huge fan of it mascara.  The color of the illuminator is beautiful but doesn&#x27;t show up well. It is definitely for daytime wear.  The creme doesn&#x27;t stay we&#x27;ll at all and needs to be reapplied often.</li>
    <li> I purchased this not knowing if I would like it.I love it,will always get it.It makes you look radiant without being too much,I really like it,would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It reflects light without glitter, giving you a fresh, dewy, appearance.  It&#x27;s very creamy, so make sure you apply it thinly...sometimes I blot some off the brush before I apply.  I use it to contour my face (light swipe above my cheek bones, at my jaw line and on my chin) and sometimes as an eyeshadow.  Just be sure to firmly close the compact after each use...I didn&#x27;t close mine all the way and it dried out a little.</li>
    <li> It does not take much of this highlighter at all.  I use it with a tiny brush just to highlight here and there. Very nice product, but a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this product in the mail and the price was about the same as it was in stores however, my store was out. Sadly, I have tried it multiple times and it makes my skin feel oily. I wanted more of a subtle look as many products make you white, too shiny or have a color tent to them. After multiple uses I do not think this product effectively illuminates, it is a little too subtle for me and only makes me appear oily.</li>
    <li> A creamy, good quality product that adds something extra to the face.  As other reviewers have said, this is not a glittery disco product.  It gives a very subtle oomph to the cheekbones. Box comes with a diagram of where to apply but I found putting any of this stuff on my forehead (as shown on diagram) made me look like ET.  And putting on the top of my lip line? - just plain weird.  But on the top sides of the cheeks - oh yes.  Gives the face a very soft glow appropriate for day or evening.  Does not settle into the lines on my face.  Amazing!  I love it.</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  Added a nice glowy look to my fair skin, not a shiny slick like some do.  Works well as a highlighter over makeup.  What I like best is that it is subtle and works without specks of glitter.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product at all. Does not even deserve one star. Does not show on skin very well or stay on.</li>
    <li> Loving how this highlights so nice:) ~~ Really helps with a nice overall face-look!  I am IMPRESSED:)!</li>
    <li> Smooth cream like consistency. Provides a  very sheen glow with no glitter. Great product to get that dewy look without all the glitter.</li>
    <li> The compliments keep rolling in.  Apparently, I&#x27;m glowing with maternal radiance these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haha.  Not!  If only they knew.  In reality, I wake up with dark circles under my eyes from tossing and turning and waking up at all hours to waddle to the bathroom.  I went looking for a highlighter to help, and found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE:  It&#x27;s bigger than I thought it would be.  Most highlighter type of cosmetics come in tiny little packages as though intended to be used only as eye shadow.  It&#x27;s the size of any regular powder compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW IT FEELS/WEARS:  It&#x27;s a light creamy gel-like stuff in feeling.  Similar to the gel type of eye shadows, if you&#x27;ve ever used those.  I haven&#x27;t noticed it to settle into skin creases, but I&#x27;m under 30 so I can&#x27;t truly speak to that.  Once it&#x27;s on, I&#x27;ve never noticed it all.  No cakey or sticky feelings or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW IT LOOKS:  It has a very vaguely pinkish tint, nowhere near a blush though so fear not!  It has a subtle shimmery glow rather than a glittery look.  With many highlighters, you end up looking very obviously doctored-up and face-painted because the stuff glitters too much.  This has very fine shimmer in it-- I think mica?-- that doesn&#x27;t show up under inspection.  The end result is that it reflects light and adds a &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; look to your face without it being so obvious that you&#x27;re faking it.  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I USE IT:  For what it&#x27;s worth, if this helps you decide, here&#x27;s the routine I use to get my fake &amp;#34;pregnancy glow.&amp;#34;  First, for any really dark spots under my eyes, I use a concealer stick if needed.  I use one quick layer of eyeshadow in light colors and do not use the darker colors for creases at all, nor any eye liners, since they seem to pronounce any around-the-eye darkness.  A brown instead of black mascara, very lightly applied.  Then, this highlighter goes on:  In a band just above the points of my cheekbones (above the blush area) and up to a half-inch-ish under my eyes, from nose around to just past eyes on the sides.  Sometimes I will also add some just under my eyebrows to help reflect light all around my eyes.  I use a quick brush of light mineral powder swept over the top to help set it and even out any odd under-eye skin tones still around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product could also be used as a mildly-shiny lip gloss or a gel-like eyeshadow to reflect light but remain mostly natural toned.-ish under my eyes, from nose around to just past eyes on the sides.  Sometimes I will also add some just under my eyebrows to help reflect light all around my eyes.

    <li> Great Product &amp; Quick delivery</li>
    <li> I have tried countless illuminazer and they always looked glittery and not flattering.  This is very soft, so soft you may not be able to see it.  I use this on my nose, under and above my eyebrows and on my cheeks.  It is buildable but a little goes a long way.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product but takes some practice! It comes with instructions, so I advise you follow them to get the effect you&#x27;re looking for. It&#x27;s very creamy and blend-able; a little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Use very little and this will last you years!  Just the right amount of highlighting without looking glitzy or shiny.</li>
    <li> I put it on and it seems to come off pretty fast.  Not worth the money.  But this is the first IT product that I haven&#x27;t absolutely loved!</li>
    <li> very good product. I have used it.</li>
    <li> This product is more hype than actual anti-aging cream...but if it makes you feel better...go ahead..get it.  Frankly,  I think next I shall save my money</li>
    <li> Great illuminator! A little goes a long way. Excellent color. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Gives a natural glow. I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> OKAY PRODUCT.  HONESTLY NOT CRAZY ABOUT IT...BUT IT IS REALLY SMOOTH AND CREAMY AS ADVERTISED.  PROBABLY WOULDN&#x27;T BUY AGAIN THOUGH</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  You can illuminate any part of your face and it looks great .  It lasts forever.  I&#x27;ve had the same compact for months and I&#x27;m still not out.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for a long time. I didn&#x27;t know what it was called as the one I have been using was worn off.  This product works for sensitive skin.  Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Just add enough radiance to make your face glow.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything, this is by far the best product.&lt;br /&gt;I smear very little on my index finger, then dab it on the center of my forehead, nose, upper cheek bone, above and right underneath the center of lip. then use a stippling brush to gently blend.&lt;br /&gt;I would have never discovered this fabulous product until it was recommended by the blogger - Maskcara.</li>
    <li> I use it down my nose, cheeks and chin. A little goes a long way. Does not contain glitter or sparkles. I really like it for my mature skin. Does not settle.</li>
    <li> Soft Silky goes on smoothly light natural look without looking cakey.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, it is so creamy and pretty. It is not shimmery it just gives you a butiful glow. I like that you can purchase it on its own. This is the first and only creme illuminator that is creamy and will glide on even when useing a brush.</li>
