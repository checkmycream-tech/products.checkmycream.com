      <li>Love this face scrub.</li>
      <li>I love all Murad products.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>The scrub is so finely grated</li>
      <li>Leaves me feeling fresh, my skin is very smooth afterwards</li>
      <li>so the smell is not annoying.</li>
      <li>Smooth.</li>
      <li>It smells light and fruity</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>Then two days a week I use this to first exfoliate (I use it with my Clarisonic for even better results.)  </li>
      <li>I got a free sample of this off of another site and had to buy the full size.  </li>
      <li>I wish these companies would go fragrance-free or use naturally pleasant essential oils for fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I use this with my battery operated facial brush for optimum effect.  </li>
      <li>Using this not only refines pores but helps structure skin routune after cleansing and just before tonibg etc plus its pretty cheap just as good as exposed microderm scrub</li>
      <li>(so your murad has a fresh start on your clean face!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Use Ivory soup to wash off makeup first!</li>
      <li>The fine grain exfoliating beads are gentle to the skin but work wonders.</li>
      <li>Not a harsh scrub, would be good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>went to the dermatologist right away</li>
      <li>Of all the major brand name polishes and exfoliants, this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I did learn that it is important to use Hydration after all this even though my skin doesnt dry out and since my skin is oily already and think it will make me break out more, but NO, even acne prone skins needs moisturized</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a thick cores scrub... great to use at night to scrub of make-up before bed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using this combo but add more Murad products into my daily skincare as well.</li>
      <li>My FAVORITE facial scrub ever!</li>
      <li>I use it twice a week on my whole face and one extra time on my nose and chin where blackheads are most prevalent.</li>
      <li>it is;-) I haven&#x27;t really had break outs since using it</li>
      <li>I much prefer the light citrus scent of the aforementioned Derma E</li>
      <li>This left my skin smooth after one use.</li>
      <li>Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion- then use the Murad mattifier as a primer if getting ready to put makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;B]</li>
      <li>Product was packaged securely and shipped/received by date expected.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that I ended up liking this exfoliating cleaner as much as I do.  </li>
      <li>I decided to keep it because overall I thought the results were worth it.</li>
      <li>I have usually normal to combination skin.</li>
      <li>With these three products every 2-3 days my pores are noticeably smaller and my blackheads are pretty much gone.  </li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m cleansing with a regular Salicylic Acid cleanser 3 days a week.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 46 with fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead that are much less noticeable after using.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t to harsh and doesn&#x27;t have a strong oder.</li>
      <li>I have tried a ton of different types of cleansers and treatments to help my large pore issue.  </li>
      <li>Product work well to unclog pores and produce clear, even skin tone.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this product did not make me break out.</li>
      <li>Same as result as the normal drugs store product.</li>
      <li>I love the way the two work together to remove dull skin, I look years younger after using it and now try to do it twice a week.  </li>
      <li>this product works really well for sensitive and oily skin types i feel, i have both sensitive combination skin type dry in a little forehead spot and oily in inside of my cheeks around the nose largely plus nose getting blackheads.</li>
      <li>, I use it near daily and my skin has improved.</li>
      <li>JUST received the Murad Post-Acne Spot Lightening Gel to finally rid the OLD MARKS.</li>
      <li>When I first tried it, it felt like other facial exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>and my face cleared back up right after using this for a few days!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not worth for this high price.</li>

<li> /&gt;Seems like alot, but different toner or gels came with 2 different systems, the Starter System and the Complex system.</li>
<li> and it is not so rough on my skin.</li>
<li> but I use other Murad product that could be helping my skins health as well.  </li>
<li> After gel has dried, I use either of these steps depending on morning/night or if I have bumps/pimples&lt;br</li>
<li> My skin does feel noticeably softer when using this product versus my Derma E Microdermabrasion Scrub or even plain baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Ever since i purchased it my pores have decreased in size dramatically and i dnt have anymore blackheads.</li>
<li> I really hate this item..</li>
<li> My skin looked awful and I had itching and burning all</li>

    <li> Holy Smokes-- This stuff is the best face wash/scrub I have ever used!  If I don&#x27;t tell people about it is because I don&#x27;t like them... that&#x27;s how good it is;-) I haven&#x27;t really had break outs since using it but I use other Murad product that could be helping my skins health as well.  It&#x27;s a thick cores scrub... great to use at night to scrub of make-up before bed.  It smells light and fruity so the smell is not annoying.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Very good exfoliate. Pores have gotten smaller and less noticeable. I use daily in the shower.</li>
    <li> Love the Murad line, great price and service</li>
    <li> this product works really well for sensitive and oily skin types i feel, i have both sensitive combination skin type dry in a little forehead spot and oily in inside of my cheeks around the nose largely plus nose getting blackheads. Using this not only refines pores but helps structure skin routune after cleansing and just before tonibg etc plus its pretty cheap just as good as exposed microderm scrub</li>
    <li> THE MURAD SYSTEM WORKS! I have been using this scrub for 4 days and already feel and see results. My face feels tighter and i can see my pores are starting to look smaller and my face overall toning out. Although this product is NOT for acne, i feel it has helped my face re-JUMPSTART the acne murad system I am already using and my face cleared back up right after using this for a few days!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Personalized system that I found to work - for acne prone skin and post-acne/dark spots:&lt;br /&gt;1. CLEANSE: Use Ivory soup to wash off makeup first! (so your murad has a fresh start on your clean face!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. CLEANSE: Both the cleanser and scrub. I go back and fort between morning/night and if I&#x27;m wearing makeup, sometimes both,&lt;br /&gt;A] Murad Pore Reform Skin Smoothing Polish/Cleanse#1&lt;br /&gt;B] Murad Clarifying Cleanser/Cleanse#1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Tone: Seabreeze! (tones and also wipes away leftover exfoliators- havent tried the Murad toner yet)&lt;br /&gt;4. TREAT/REPAIR: Murad Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel/Treat.Repair#2&lt;br /&gt;5. TREAT/REPAIR: After gel has dried, I use either of these steps depending on morning/night or if I have bumps/pimples&lt;br /&gt;A] Morning- Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion- then use the Murad mattifier as a primer if getting ready to put makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;B] Night- Acne Spot Fast Fix (only dab on problem areas, only need a little!) *this is Benzoyl peroxide based, the SULFER spot fix did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like alot, but different toner or gels came with 2 different systems, the Starter System and the Complex system. I&#x27;m using parts of each system that I feel worked best. I did learn that it is important to use Hydration after all this even though my skin doesnt dry out and since my skin is oily already and think it will make me break out more, but NO, even acne prone skins needs moisturized it DOES actually help your break outs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I JUST received the Murad Post-Acne Spot Lightening Gel to finally rid the OLD MARKS. My momuses it and I read great reviews. Will probably use in place of Skin Perfecting Lotion in morning.</li>
    <li> Really nice scrub, but very fine.  Not a harsh scrub, would be good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE facial scrub ever!</li>
    <li> Product work well to unclog pores and produce clear, even skin tone. Product was packaged securely and shipped/received by date expected. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product! Can definitely feel a difference</li>
    <li> This is some of the best face wash! It made my skin look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Nice product. I love all Murad products.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this and use it weekly. Great results and leaves my face feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom. Smooth.</li>
    <li> Very nice scrub, I use it near daily and my skin has improved. I have used Murad for years and they are just a good product over all..</li>
    <li> This left my skin smooth after one use. It wasn&#x27;t to harsh and doesn&#x27;t have a strong oder.</li>
    <li> I have tried a ton of different types of cleansers and treatments to help my large pore issue.  It has been an issue for a long time (15 years) and I&#x27;ve never found anything that caused an actual difference (even in a combo with other products).  Right now I&#x27;m cleansing with a regular Salicylic Acid cleanser 3 days a week.  Then two days a week I use this to first exfoliate (I use it with my Clarisonic for even better results.)  Then I use the [[ASIN:B009JCVSV0 Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Peel, 2 fl. oz.]].  I follow that up with the [[ASIN:B005I4119W Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Mask, 2 fl. oz.]].  Yes, this seems like a lot, but you&#x27;ve never met my skin.  With these three products every 2-3 days my pores are noticeably smaller and my blackheads are pretty much gone.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this combo but add more Murad products into my daily skincare as well.</li>
    <li> Love this face scrub. The scrub is so finely grated and it is not so rough on my skin. Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product smells great! The fine grain exfoliating beads are gentle to the skin but work wonders. I use it twice a week on my whole face and one extra time on my nose and chin where blackheads are most prevalent. Of all the major brand name polishes and exfoliants, this one is my favorite.</li>

I love the way the two work together to remove dull skin, I look years younger after using it and now try to do it twice a week.  I got a free sample of this off of another site and had to buy the full size.  I&#x27;m 46 with fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead that are much less noticeable after using.</li>

    <li> Amazing product.  It&#x27;s really different than any other face scrubs I ever use.  Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that I ended up liking this exfoliating cleaner as much as I do.  When I first tried it, it felt like other facial exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve used and I assumed I wouldn&#x27;t see a difference.  My skin does feel noticeably softer when using this product versus my Derma E Microdermabrasion Scrub or even plain baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it four stars because 1) it has done nothing to &amp;#34;reform&amp;#34; my enlarged pores and 2) because of the synthetic fragrance.  Thank goodness the perfume smell does not stay on your skin.  I wish these companies would go fragrance-free or use naturally pleasant essential oils for fragrance.  I much prefer the light citrus scent of the aforementioned Derma E product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this a Sephora because I wanted to return it if I did not work for me.  I decided to keep it because overall I thought the results were worth it.</li>
    <li> Good for a cleanser and toner. I have sensitive skin and this product did not make me break out.</li>
    <li> It does its job. It cleans my face without leaving any type of residue and shrinks my pores. Im still one month in on this product so i have to see how it does over the next two months</li>
    <li> Leaves me feeling fresh, my skin is very smooth afterwards (so perfect for makeup application) and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Best exfoliate for density skin</li>
    <li> I have usually normal to combination skin. The Murad representative recommended this to me because I wanted something that is gentle on my skin and also removes blackheads and dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product along with the daily cleanser from Murad (I wish I did not) and after 2 uses only I had dermatitis. My skin looked awful and I had itching and burning all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dermatologist right away and they gave me a cream which thankfully got rid of it... I really hate this item..</li>
    <li> Same as result as the normal drugs store product. Not worth for this high price.</li>
