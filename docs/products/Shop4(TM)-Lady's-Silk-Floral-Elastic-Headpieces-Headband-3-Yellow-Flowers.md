      <li>Headband is super cute !</li>
      <li>Took awhile to come in but when it did I was totally excited !</li>
      <li>I say these are just as good as the high end ones :)</li>
      <li>It is a really cute head band  , but it looks cheap  .</li>
      <li>The flowers are nice and pretty.</li>
      <li>but it is still hip and super cute.</li>
      <li>Super cute.</li>
      <li>Super cute and stretchy(:</li>
      <li>Very Pretty!</li>
      <li>and cheap</li>
      <li>I feel it was cheaply made and</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>What I got was four flowers made of cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>loved it but after the second use the flowers started falling off</li>
      <li>Its not too bold and tacky</li>
      <li>I had to pick off excess hot glue, but it&#x27;s still pretty cute for the price.</li>
      <li>Also cheap, make sure to put some extra glue on the flowers, they do fall off</li>
      <li>Headband arrived in tact and looks cute from far away but close up</li>
      <li>Took a while to get to me, but there was no need for it right away</li>
      <li>It came in super fast and I have bought others for my friends &amp; they love it just as equally</li>
      <li>The photo looks a lot better than it actually looks.</li>
      <li>this headband was so pretty on here</li>
      <li>I will most definitely buy again !!</li>
      <li>broke first time i used it</li>
      <li>After removing the rest of the hot glue, I wore the remainder of the headband, just the leaves, and continued to receive compliments on it.</li>
      <li>Wear it all the time and get many compliments arrived when expected</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet but just from handling it I can tell it is very durable.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for the earrings anyway, but still - I did not receive something I should have with this purchase</li>
      <li>Such a pretty headband with the pretty sunflowers!</li>
      <li>The flowers are not extremely stiff or covered  in hot glue like the others I have received.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get the earings that they said would come with it for free and one of the three flowers on it was crushed.</li>
      <li>so all I have to do to make it fit in the back is tie a tiny rubber around it</li>
      <li>Overall, a cute product, but not worth the price paid for it.</li>
      <li>Not perfect, but definitely good.  </li>
      <li>the flowers are a little too small and headband looks funny, but great for a little girl</li>
      <li>and it arrived much quicker than expected.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The flowers are cheaply hot glued on, and stick out in odd directions.</li>
      <li>Usually these headbands look a little fake but this one is great !</li>

<li> It took longer than most packages from Amazon to arrive and when I opened the package, it was a major disappointment.</li>
<li> not cute in real life.</li>

<li> This flower halo has so much potential, but unfortunately it has poor-quality written all over it.</li>
<li> I really like this piece but after a while of wearing it, one of the flowers fell off :(</li>
<li> One of the flowers was glued on so poorly that it sticks out at such an awkward angle</li>
<li> Overall  disappointed in materials workmanship  and &amp;#34;look.&amp;#34; Save your  money.</li>
<li> Just look silly with 2 small flowers.</li>
<li> the elastic.was.even twisted</li>
<li> I thought it was ugly,  the flowers were orange, looked nothing like a sunflower.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
<li> Once ripped off, the headband still looked terrible with just the leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>

    <li> I love everything about these headbands! So they are ao cute and hippie I have a very very tiny head so all I have to do to make it fit in the back is tie a tiny rubber around it an I cover it up when I want to wear it with my pony tail. Such a pretty headband with the pretty sunflowers! Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Very Pretty! Great Price!</li>
    <li> Headband arrived in tact and looks cute from far away but close up it is extremely cheap-looking. I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet but just from handling it I can tell it is very durable. Can&#x27;t complain for the price, though.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to come in but when it did I was totally excited ! Usually these headbands look a little fake but this one is great ! The flowers are not extremely stiff or covered  in hot glue like the others I have received. This headband is beautiful!</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like the picture. I thought it was ugly,  the flowers were orange, looked nothing like a sunflower.</li>
    <li> Love this very cute on ....</li>
    <li> bought it for my sister and she loves it!</li>
    <li> The flowers came off only a few hours into wearing the headband. After removing the rest of the hot glue, I wore the remainder of the headband, just the leaves, and continued to receive compliments on it. Overall, a cute product, but not worth the price paid for it.</li>
    <li> Adorable! i purchased these for our church dance team.&lt;br /&gt;CONS.. it took about two weeks to get to my house, and also it not made for adults. Mostly kids and maybe teens.</li>
    <li> Its not too bold and tacky but it is still hip and super cute. Very trendy and &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; in today&#x27;s fashion.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and came within two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flowers are cheaply hot glued on, and stick out in odd directions. Once ripped off, the headband still looked terrible with just the leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommened and a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Sent me one and one of the followers was not the same as the others. One was yellow and orange. The others were just yellow. 👎</li>
    <li> Wear it all the time and get many compliments arrived when expected</li>
    <li> Very cute. Took a while to get to me, but there was no need for it right away so all is well. But it did not come with the little owl earrings that were pictured. I didn&#x27;t really care for the earrings anyway, but still - I did not receive something I should have with this purchase</li>
    <li> Its very cute, one of the flowers fell off the night I got it but I took care of it with some fabric glue.</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but definitely good.  Price wasn&#x27;t too bad and shipping was pretty quick considering it&#x27;s starting destination.  Satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Headband is super cute ! Came earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> the flowers are a little too small and headband looks funny, but great for a little girl</li>
    <li> this headband was so pretty on here and cheap so I figured why not, let&#x27;s get it. it shipped the next day and I recieved it within a week or two. I didn&#x27;t get the earings that they said would come with it for free and one of the three flowers on it was crushed.</li>
    <li> This headband is a scam. The photo looks a lot better than it actually looks. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Love this headband!  Great quality, super cute and it arrived much quicker than expected.  I&#x27;ve worn  it several times and the quality has still held up, and it doesnt stretch out.</li>
    <li> So cute around my afro puff!</li>
    <li> Super cute and stretchy(:</li>
    <li> I really like this piece but after a while of wearing it, one of the flowers fell off :(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t  look like the picture, not the same materials, like in the picture there are three flowers made with fabric. What I got was four flowers made of cheap plastic. Overall  disappointed in materials workmanship  and &amp;#34;look.&amp;#34; Save your  money.</li>
    <li> not cute in real life.</li>
    <li> As soon as i took it out the packaging a flower fell out. Now i cant wear it. Just look silly with 2 small flowers.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was described and very satisfied with purchase!</li>
    <li> It wasnot at all what i expected. I feel it was cheaply made and the elastic.was.even twisted</li>
    <li> broke first time i used it</li>
    <li> Super cute. Also cheap, make sure to put some extra glue on the flowers, they do fall off</li>
    <li> loved it but after the second use the flowers started falling off</li>
    <li> This flower halo has so much potential, but unfortunately it has poor-quality written all over it. It took longer than most packages from Amazon to arrive and when I opened the package, it was a major disappointment. The glue holding the flowers to the band shows on all three flowers and the glue chunks even scratches at your forehead. One of the flowers was glued on so poorly that it sticks out at such an awkward angle and you cannot bend it to fix it. I never bothered wearing this out and I probably never will. Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t pricey so I&#x27;m not too upset.</li>
    <li> Really nice just worried about any flowers falling off.</li>
    <li> Love this head band !! I will most definitely buy again !! I recommend to anyone who like floral headbands. This is to cute !!</li>
    <li> Package came in a week before expected, however, the headband smelled like vinegar. I had to pick off excess hot glue, but it&#x27;s still pretty cute for the price. I&#x27;ll be wearing this headband a lot this summer :)</li>
    <li> It is a really cute head band  , but it looks cheap  . And I didn&#x27;t get the owl earrings it&#x27;s supposed to come with .</li>
    <li> I like it but I was hoping for....more</li>
    <li> This headband is AMAZING! It&#x27;s a great buy for how cheap it is I always get compliments whenever I wear it! It came in super fast and I have bought others for my friends &amp; they love it just as equally I say these are just as good as the high end ones :)</li>
    <li> I bought this headband for my daughter, who loves floral headbands. When I showed her the picture, she got very excited. The only thing is I have not received this product.  So I am unable to write an accurate review. I haven&#x27;t contacted the shipper as of yet, because I wanted to give the time it gave Dora received date.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Broke within a week. But you get what you pay for.</li>
