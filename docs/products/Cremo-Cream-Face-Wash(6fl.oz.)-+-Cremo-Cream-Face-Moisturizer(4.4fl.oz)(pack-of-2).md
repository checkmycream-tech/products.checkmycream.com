      <li>I discovered Cremo Shave Cream about a year ago, it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Cremo cream is awesome.</li>
      <li>- EXCELLENT at unclogging pores and releasing blackheads!  </li>
      <li>No scent just great soap and moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This has been a great purchase.</li>
      <li>Great Product.  </li>

      <li>the Face Wash and Moisturizer are great, as I</li>
      <li>is a great consistency, would reorder.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, great quality and great price!  </li>
      <li>, it seems to be a good product</li>
      <li>Great products!&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for my honest review.</li>
      <li>Okay at best, there are better products than this.</li>
      <li>I purchased the shaving cream and was amazed with the close shave that I experienced, which lead me to try more of their line.</li>
      <li>Try it and let me know if you&#x27;ve found anything better!</li>
      <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>Cleans off very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue.</li>
      <li>I continue to be impressed with this company&#x27;s products: simple, effective, convenient, no-muss-no-fuss.</li>
      <li>The wash was OK.</li>
      <li>Love both products.</li>
      <li>I use them exclusively for my face and love the results.</li>
      <li>- I would almost like it to be a bit more sudsy (again, is this a word?).  </li>
      <li>Used in conjunction with Cremo Shaving Cream, I achieve the closest cut free, close shave results ever!</li>
      <li>I love these Cremo products.</li>
      <li>I just happened to see this reccommended, and I am glad</li>
      <li>When ordering more Cremo Cream for shaving, I saw these as an add-on and I ordered them.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Cremo Company shaving cream for over a year now and love it.</li>
      <li>best facial wash that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Once I finally ran out, I opted to for this duo and am again impressed.</li>
      <li>And with their rebate program, you can even try for free!</li>
      <li>Great product line, I would highly recommend the Shaving cream.</li>
      <li>So far I am happy with these products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly a year now and have seen some great improvements, whether I&#x27;m sporting my bushman beard or shaving every day.</li>
      <li>I originally got the wash in a subscription box and fell in love.</li>
      <li>A bottle of the wash lasts 6 months easy.</li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff all around.</li>
      <li>My face is smooth and moisturized, and it is not sticky on my skin</li>
      <li>All work fantastic.</li>
      <li>The wash has a silky smooth feel to it but lacks lather, which is not what we are used to.  </li>
      <li>The scent is great in comparison to many other products that cleanse your face.</li>
      <li>But lather doesn&#x27;t necessarily clean.  </li>
      <li>Wash.&lt;br /&gt;Low-foam, cleanse well, rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
      <li>you feeling clean and lotion leaves no oily residue.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really use the moisturizer, but love the face wash.</li>
      <li>ALSO COOL FACT - supposedly</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t really gotten around to using the moisturizer more than once or twice,</li>
      <li>- Cleanses well, and washes away cleanly and quickly.  </li>
      <li>Packaging looks good but upon closer inspection you can tell the plastic bottles are not well made, but thats a minor issue and does not stop me from ordering this over and over again.  </li>
      <li>The product is very neutral and leaves your skin feeling naturally clean and oil free.</li>
      <li>Works great, leaves my very sensitive skin feeling terrific.</li>
      <li>Moisturizer: Non-greasy, quickly absorbed, no fragrance to conflict with the cologne,</li>
      <li>It is as good as my favorite H&amp;B Dead Sea Minerals After Shave Balm, but much cheaper.</li>
      <li>but i feel good about using products with minimal ingredients on my face.</li>
      <li>I was extremely impressed with both--and they have displaced my other facial cleansers and moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>There is no need to use more than recommended which in turn makes it more cost efficient than other products.</li>
      <li>The face wash works fine, but the aftershave moisturizer seems to dry my skin out more than it would be if I had used nothing at all.</li>
      <li>Non-greasy, absorbs quickly, reduced redness and irritation fast.</li>
      <li>Cremo, however, simply is the absolute BEST face wash out there - hands down!  </li>
      <li>The fact that he did the research of mens premium face care/shave products and created something which had all of the necessary and helpful ingredients, without all the hype is very cool.</li>
      <li>Do people really pay that much for face wash?!  </li>
      <li>I looked over the ingredients, and although I am not an expert, I like the fact that a large portion of the ingredients are herbal in</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried it too often after my shaves because I use Weleda After Shave Balm (yea, it is pimp grade)</li>
      <li>Really can&#x27;t beat these.</li>
      <li>Really like all the Cremo products</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using these two products I&#x27;ve been noticing much smoother and softer skin on my face, and in conjunction with the Cremo shaving cream, I&#x27;m noticing much closer and smoother shaves.</li>
      <li>Face wash dries your face too much.</li>
      <li>To be honest it was a bit of an impulse purchase - I had recently traded in my Mach 4 for a Double Edged razor, and was on Amazon buying shaving creams, after shave,pre-shave, etc etc.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t dry me out too much, didn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
      <li>some way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is nice as well - just what it says on the bottle - moisturizing, without being slimy, slick, and leaving residue.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It cleans quickly and thoroughly, without over-sudsing (is that a word?), and although it is labeled as \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, it leaves behind only the faintest of clean, fresh scents that quickly dissipates and will not interfere with your deodorant, aftershave, or cologne.    </li>
      <li>I was very surprised at these products, particularly the face wash.</li>
      <li>and I am sure I will use it more when it gets cold</li>
      <li>Both products work well, and my, very sensitive, skin has had no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I got my first bottle as a freebie along with a Bespoke Post purchase, and I was instantly hooked.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle, but it will definitely not be my last.</li>
      <li>its nice the a little bit goes a long way with the wash and the lotion</li>
      <li>I tried a number of other products from Olay, Neutrogena, Dove, and Clean &amp; Clear and none of them leave my face feeling as refreshed as the Cremo does.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and their products do not irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>Their products just go so far, and like the bottle says, it just works.</li>
      <li>Lightweight but somehow really greasy and powdery at the same time.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t work as well (for me), and I can leave it on for awhile before it dries me out at all, which is cool because I have a pretty temperamentally dry face usually.</li>
      <li>Wash very well and does not over dry my skin!</li>
      <li>However, with the face wash: I do my usual shower clean, put on the face wash, shampoo, then rinse it all off.</li>
      <li>As a new convert to world of male skincare (still trying to figure out what toner is), there simply isn&#x27;t enough that I can say about Cremo Cream Face Wash.  </li>
      <li>wash: does not dry out the skin, my wife loves it.</li>
      <li>It leaves your face feeling refreshed and clean and it definitely is a plus when it cleans off without leaving some residue (or at least feeling of it).</li>
      <li>The wash leaves my skin feeling soft and not at all dry.  </li>
      <li>By the end of the day, my forehead and nose can be a little shiny, as I tend a bit toward oily skin but have only light acne, and this seemed to make things much less \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only noticed a small difference in my acne since i have started using this product... but i feel good about using products with minimal ingredients on my face. its nice the a little bit goes a long way with the wash and the lotion is a great consistency, would reorder.</li>
    <li> Cremo cream is awesome. I have been using their shaving cream and decided to try the face wash and moisturizer. I wish the facewash didnt have sodium laureth sulfate in it because i stay away from products with sulfates especially SLS. I have dermatitis and any product with SLS usually flares up my condition. The moisturizer is awesome though.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  The wash has a silky smooth feel to it but lacks lather, which is not what we are used to.  But lather doesn&#x27;t necessarily clean.  I use them exclusively for my face and love the results.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I have sensitive skin, and their products do not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I will never stop with Cremo. I originally got the wash in a subscription box and fell in love. The wash leaves my skin feeling soft and not at all dry.  A bottle of the wash lasts 6 months easy. Once I finally ran out, I opted to for this duo and am again impressed. The moisturizer absorbs quickly without any ick feeling being left behind. My skins looks and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer. Face wash is somewhat generic but does the job. Moisturizer keeps your face feeling soft without suffocating it with that typical lotion-y tarp.</li>
    <li> The face wash works fine, but the aftershave moisturizer seems to dry my skin out more than it would be if I had used nothing at all. No idea why.</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with these products. The scent is great in comparison to many other products that cleanse your face. Just follow the instructions for both. There is no need to use more than recommended which in turn makes it more cost efficient than other products.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is not awesome. Lightweight but somehow really greasy and powdery at the same time. I threw it away, actually. With that kinda cakey feel, I&#x27;d use an SPF! The wash was OK. Didn&#x27;t dry me out too much, didn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, great quality and great price!  Packaging looks good but upon closer inspection you can tell the plastic bottles are not well made, but thats a minor issue and does not stop me from ordering this over and over again.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I love these Cremo products. My face is smooth and moisturized, and it is not sticky on my skin</li>
    <li> When ordering more Cremo Cream for shaving, I saw these as an add-on and I ordered them.  I was extremely impressed with both--and they have displaced my other facial cleansers and moisturizers.  I appreciate the concentrated formula of the cleanser and the fragrance-free formula of the moisturizer.  I continue to be impressed with this company&#x27;s products: simple, effective, convenient, no-muss-no-fuss.</li>
    <li> Working in retail cosmetics for a number of years, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything. I gave Cremo Face Wash &amp; Moisturizer a shot, based on a friends recommendation. I&#x27;ve since given up my Kiehls addiction and switched to Cremo! It&#x27;s simple, quality and my skin approves!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really use the moisturizer, but love the face wash. I have a separate face wash that I use and I haven&#x27;t really gotten around to using the moisturizer more than once or twice, so I can&#x27;t attest to its long-term usage. However, with the face wash: I do my usual shower clean, put on the face wash, shampoo, then rinse it all off. I find if I leave it on any less it doesn&#x27;t work as well (for me), and I can leave it on for awhile before it dries me out at all, which is cool because I have a pretty temperamentally dry face usually. Cleans off very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue. I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly a year now and have seen some great improvements, whether I&#x27;m sporting my bushman beard or shaving every day.</li>
    <li> I discovered Cremo Shave Cream about a year ago, it&#x27;s an excellent product. Then I decided to give their face wash and moisturizer a try. Again, excellent products. Like the shave cream, you only use a very small amount. Works great, leaves my very sensitive skin feeling terrific. Using these products I never have any discomfort due to shaving.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer: Non-greasy, quickly absorbed, no fragrance to conflict with the cologne, an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Face wash: does not dry out the skin, my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I want to buy stock in this company.</li>
    <li> Really can&#x27;t beat these. Face wash leaves you feeling clean and lotion leaves no oily residue.</li>
    <li> best facial wash that I have ever used. No scent just great soap and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at these products, particularly the face wash. To be honest it was a bit of an impulse purchase - I had recently traded in my Mach 4 for a Double Edged razor, and was on Amazon buying shaving creams, after shave,pre-shave, etc etc. I just happened to see this reccommended, and I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash does mentions that it is supposed to have a \\&quot;PH Balancing\\&quot; effect, which I must say I could tell a difference after used for a few days. By the end of the day, my forehead and nose can be a little shiny, as I tend a bit toward oily skin but have only light acne, and this seemed to make things much less \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;. I looked over the ingredients, and although I am not an expert, I like the fact that a large portion of the ingredients are herbal in some way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is nice as well - just what it says on the bottle - moisturizing, without being slimy, slick, and leaving residue. It soaks up well. I haven&#x27;t really tried it too often after my shaves because I use Weleda After Shave Balm (yea, it is pimp grade), it seems to be a good product and I am sure I will use it more when it gets cold outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers Creamo. ALSO COOL FACT - supposedly Creamo was started by the guy who invented the dry erase board. The fact that he did the research of mens premium face care/shave products and created something which had all of the necessary and helpful ingredients, without all the hype is very cool. IF it stays this price, I will continue to but it!</li>
    <li> Great products. Face wash doesn&#x27;t over dry. Lotion isn&#x27;t greasy. I also use the shave cream. Really like all the Cremo products</li>
    <li> Okay at best, there are better products than this. Face wash dries your face too much.</li>
    <li> Wash very well and does not over dry my skin! the moisturizer is soothing and hydrates throughout the day. Great products!&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Cremo brushless shaving cream, so I decided to try other Creamo products.  This set didn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face Wash.&lt;br /&gt;Low-foam, cleanse well, rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Soften whiskers well for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;I use as after-shave balm. Non-greasy, absorbs quickly, reduced redness and irritation fast. It is as good as my favorite H&amp;B Dead Sea Minerals After Shave Balm, but much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff all around. I highly recommend it. The face wash doesn&#x27;t dry my already dry skin out. Thumbs up from me.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Cremo Company shaving cream for over a year now and love it. So, when I heard they also made face washes and moisturizers I knew I had to have them. Their website has them at the same price, but the two day shipping helped serve my impulse purchase desire. I tried a number of other products from Olay, Neutrogena, Dove, and Clean &amp; Clear and none of them leave my face feeling as refreshed as the Cremo does. The product is very neutral and leaves your skin feeling naturally clean and oil free. Since I&#x27;ve been using these two products I&#x27;ve been noticing much smoother and softer skin on my face, and in conjunction with the Cremo shaving cream, I&#x27;m noticing much closer and smoother shaves. I&#x27;ve told everyone about their products and with me they&#x27;ve earned a lifelong customer. Their products just go so far, and like the bottle says, it just works. You owe it to yourself to try their products, you won&#x27;t regret it! And with their rebate program, you can even try for free! I&#x27;m still on my first bottle, but it will definitely not be my last.</li>
    <li> I use Cremo shave lotion along with these products.  All work fantastic.</li>
    <li> As a new convert to world of male skincare (still trying to figure out what toner is), there simply isn&#x27;t enough that I can say about Cremo Cream Face Wash.  I got my first bottle as a freebie along with a Bespoke Post purchase, and I was instantly hooked.  I had used samples of other products in the past; some with price tags ~$50 for full-sized products!  Do people really pay that much for face wash?!  Some left behind a subtle, but lingering odor of Piña colada, which when combined with my pine-scented pomade and my Bay Rum aftershave left me smelling like a lost lumberjack on a Caribbean cruise!  Cremo, however, simply is the absolute BEST face wash out there - hands down!  It cleans quickly and thoroughly, without over-sudsing (is that a word?), and although it is labeled as \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, it leaves behind only the faintest of clean, fresh scents that quickly dissipates and will not interfere with your deodorant, aftershave, or cologne.    PROS:  - Cleanses well, and washes away cleanly and quickly.  - Doesn&#x27;t smell like you stole if from your girlfriends side of the sink.  - EXCELLENT at unclogging pores and releasing blackheads!  - Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily, or \\&quot;covered\\&quot;.    CONS:  - I would almost like it to be a bit more sudsy (again, is this a word?).  I know it&#x27;s working, but I miss the visual associated with \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Both products work well, and my, very sensitive, skin has had no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only they can fix that horrible scent they use in the saving cream.</li>
    <li> Love both products. I got turned on by this product when I got a sample of it from Bespoke Post. It leaves your face feeling refreshed and clean and it definitely is a plus when it cleans off without leaving some residue (or at least feeling of it).</li>
    <li> Great product line, I would highly recommend the Shaving cream. I purchased the shaving cream and was amazed with the close shave that I experienced, which lead me to try more of their line. the Face Wash and Moisturizer are great, as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products, would not use anything else anymore.</li>
    <li> Have been using Cremo face wash for over a year now. I received my 1st bottle in a dopp kit I order through Bespoke Post. I have both psoriasis and rosacea in spots on my face. This is the 1st cleaner I have used that seems to help reduce the flare-ups. I assume this is due to the neutral ph of the face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Great face wash, and this size bottle will last a user several months.</li>
    <li> Used in conjunction with Cremo Shaving Cream, I achieve the closest cut free, close shave results ever! I&#x27;ve even taken to mixing other shave soaps and creams with Cremo to avoid nicks and razor irritation - works like a charm! Use the wash before shaving and the moisturizer is a terrific healing aftershave. Try it and let me know if you&#x27;ve found anything better!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has oily skin. This has been a great purchase. You only use a small amount of each and the face wash cleanses his skin and then the moisturizer works without leaving him oily. Cremo is the cream of the crop!</li>
