<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my first Water Flosser. It is powerful and easy to use. I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I have periodontal disease and I have to clean my teeth very carefully everyday. This water flosser is much better than traditional flosser it helps me a lot. Strongly recommend to anyone who need special care with their teeth.</li>
    <li> GREAT product, excellent design. Also, I am extremely impressed with this company&#x27;s GREAT customer service.  You won&#x27;t go wrong buying this product. Does everything I need it to do and more.</li>
    <li> I have only had for a short time and it works just fine.  I am not one who enjoys flossing so I generally avoid it.  Since this doesn&#x27;t draw blood when I use it (which is twice a day) I use it everyday.  My gums look healthier and I can feel that there is less plaque on my teeth.  I am curious what my dentist is going to say because he won&#x27;t be looking at the normal train wreck.</li>
    <li> Very nice flossier, well built, works great.</li>
    <li> This product worked when we got it, but after a couple months, it stopped working. My husband is very disappointed. He has tried to figure out what is wrong, but &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t work anymore&amp;#34; that&#x27;s what is wrong! Beware!</li>
    <li> Outstanding.  So much better than a waterpik.</li>
    <li> Great way to protect your gums from gum disease and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was excited to order and receive this water flosser, after seeing all the favorable reviews. After setting it up and turning it on, my unit rattled, shook, and squeaked, and did not function properly. I am returning it, accordingly, and reordering another, perhaps from another seller depending on how the return process goes, on the chance the one I received was a rare defective unit.</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago and it eventually died.  I tried two others which I quickly returned to the store.  I LOVE this one!  And plan to purchase two more as gifts for my children.</li>
    <li> Works great and the price was one of the best I could find!</li>
    <li> Husband is very satisfied.  He tried another one but didn&#x27;t work well</li>
    <li> DON&amp;#34;T Buy this Flosser !!!!  This is one of the worse products I have purchased in a long time, poor quality, worthless, just plain &amp;#34;CRAP&amp;#34; extremely&lt;br /&gt;poor quality control !!!!  Did NOT work right out of the box was NOT damaged through shipment but water leaks from around the handle no water pressure no matter how you adjust it or push or reposition the reservoir and nothing you can do to get it to work even with all there suggestions its worthless. Suggest getting a different brand.......or you will be sorry !!!!  &amp;#60;A WAIST OF MONEY&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I love this.  There&#x27;s more than enough variety and number of attachments.  The container is large and the power is excellent.  This is the 4th water flosser I&#x27;ve owned and is the best.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying using the water flosser and my husband is also using it sometimes.</li>
    <li> My teeth is the least part that I would like to talk to because of idleness until i bought myself this one. It release my pain and I love it. People who have the same problem should really try it.</li>
    <li> Easy to put together and use. Very effective at cleaning between teeth and gums. Will have to add my dentist&#x27;s assessment later. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love the water flosser, my gums are so healthy now</li>
    <li> Great water pick!  It arrived on time and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I got this Water Flosser first time, I really liked it. I like this one much more than the others, the reservoir seems like it fits more precisely, it is very quiet, and it is very powerful.</li>
    <li> I think is a nice Instrument, easy to handle and to make good use of it. i recomend you if you are in need of one of those.</li>
    <li> This device was recommended and it is used twice daily by myself. I have no complaints and it does a thorough job. Cleans teeth and gums better than flossing and leaves the mouth feeling fresh. The price is not out of most people&#x27;s grasp.</li>
    <li> Function is really good and the water is quite clean and purity. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even had this product 30 days, and already it is unusable!  The &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button either sticks in the down position or it doesn&#x27;t work at all, thus getting water all over the bathroom.  I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend.  I&#x27;d return it to the sender, but unfortunately after two weeks I threw the original packaging away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> A decent water pick for the price, does what is says.  Is a bit noisy but they all are, also when you fill the reservoir the rubber piece that separates it from the base tends to leak so I only fill it as much as I will use, don&#x27;t like wiping down the counters.  Otherwise seems like a  solid product. I put hydrogen peroxide in mine with the water, sometimes mouthwash.  Hope this helps some people. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX UPDATE: Only had this thing a few months, 2 users but one of us is rarely home.  It decided one day that it wanted to stop pulsating and instead just ooze out in a pathetic plunge to the sink with no pressure whatsoever.  For the money I don&#x27;t think it was worth it and will definitely not be buying this brand again.  Hope THIS helps some people :)</li>
