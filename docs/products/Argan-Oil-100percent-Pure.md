<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Timeless Skin Care is great.  I recently added this product to the other items I use.  I was thrilled that this too is as effective.  I use this for my hair and cuticles.  I love that it absorbs quickly and  softens  my hair and hands without greasiness.  I love that these items can be used alone, or blended with other oils or skin and haircare products.  This vendor was very quick with delivery.  I buy these 2 oz sizes to try and then buy the 8 oz size  to replenish and share.</li>
    <li> very light, penetrating oil--not greasy.  feels good on my face, hands and wherever i put it.  i will want some more.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to any skin type. Not greasy, and good for the skin. Makes the skin healthy looking.</li>
    <li> brought my skin to life - not greasy - product suggested from friend - great that it is in a glass bottle so no spills!</li>
    <li> Hi, well first off I am using another Argon oil but this one sound&#x27;s the same.  I at first put the oil on my entire face and I broke out really bad, I thought maybe it was just removing impurities.  Then I saw on the web about people who used it on their entire face and broke out.  So I started just using it around my eyes, but not too close as it spread&#x27;s some,  anyway, I have barely any lines at all, I&#x27;m 48 and honestly I see people my age and they have more crow&#x27;s feet then me.  I really have to applaud this oil.  I swear by it.  I put it on at night around my eye area, after I have washed my face.  I can&#x27;t say enough about Argon Oil. My ex boyfriend say&#x27;s I look 30.  :)  Make sure if you rub your eyes you don&#x27;t touch other part&#x27;s of your face it will put the oil where you don&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;This is my experience with Argon oil.  I hope it works as good for you as it does for me, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work on cracked heels, moisturizing skin... and i am fond of purity.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Don&#x27;t know if it makes the wrinkles go away but is keeping my face moist through a cold and dry winter. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Only after one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and chemically damaged. I applied this oil and left it on for 24 hours. (Slept in a shower cap - so sexy!), washed the oil out the next morning and my hair feels saved already. Will do this once a week. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair. So silky!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the watts brand. You get more oil for the same price. This did not give my hair the same nice soft feel as the Watts brand.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this argan oil. It really helps my skin look radiant and I could see results with then 1 week of use. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and am very pleased. I mix a little bit of aloe vera gel with 3 drops of argan oil to put on my face every morning and evening, and I look 10 years younger. I also use the aloe vera with argan oil after showering. It is not a very thick or oil but a little goes a long way. I have also put a few drops in my hands and rubbed it through my hair while damp and my hair feels so soft and amazing, with no oily residue.Well worth the money, and kudos to amazon.com!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works and the price is right.  Saw it sold on TV for about 5 times the Amazon price.  I cannot do without it at my age.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful.  I actually use it on my face at night in place of my normal moisturizer.....and can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks in the morning.  You have to understand that my skin is NOT a point of beauty for me - never has been.  But using Argon oil has made a significant difference.  It does feel lightly oily going on, but quickly absorbs and just leaves soft skin.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> It was OK, but I really felt like it was a little to oily feeling on my skin.But I can use it.</li>
    <li> You can see a difference overnight! My face looks soft and fresh. I put a couple&lt;br /&gt;of drops in my usual night cream and just pat it together a little as I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;The other day, after shampooing and combing through the wet hair, I put&lt;br /&gt;several drops into my palm, rubbed hands together and applied throughout&lt;br /&gt;my hair,starting with the ends. Ended up with silky, shiny hair...BONUS !</li>
    <li> Love  this. Does not feel greasy at all, feels nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> Just started using this oil.  So far, so good.  Love the cool apothecary bottle,and great low price. Arrived quickly after ordered</li>
    <li> I think this Argan Oil 100% Pure is exactly what I expected.  I use it in conjunction with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Squalane &amp; Moringa Oil for my scaly skin as I am allergic to chemicals in toiletries, foods, vitamins, etc. &amp; they make my skin inflammed, burned, then scaly.  Argan Oil helps soothe my skin.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my dry toenails.  I am a runner with very bad dry and calloused feet.  Helps to minimize cracks and chips, and soften callouses.</li>
    <li> I have really dry, curly hair. I bought this product based on the positive reviews from consumers. I was glad I bought it because it makes my hair really soft and silky. I highly recommend this if you have dry, unruly hair. It is an awesome product!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is argan oil. I&#x27;ve purchased argan oil before, and argan oils have a distinctive scent. this one has no scent. Didn&#x27;t see any results either.</li>
    <li> I used argan oil products regularly and saw this as a great way to add it to normal staples without the high cost of specialty items.  I&#x27;m a big fan of hair oil and add a small amount to the ends of my long thick hair after showing to lock in moisture, detangle and improve health.  My only complaint is that my hair usually looks a little greasier afterwards than I&#x27;d like.  Some extra brushing once it dries does the trick, though.  Overall, I like it and will probably keep restocking.</li>
    <li> Love it - I sometimes put it on my face straight, and I sometimes mix a few drops with my moisturizer.  It has no discernible smell and it just sinks into my skin.  I have very sensitive skin, but this product has never made me break out or given me a rash.  I have also used it to keep condition my hair, which is pretty nice too - although a little expensive.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is so luxurious. I couldn&#x27;t believe the quality of this container of argan oil when it arrived. It arrived timely also.</li>
    <li> Over my 70 some years I have used a great number if face creams, however, when I started using the Argan Oil 1 month ago I was amazed on how my face felt and looked.  I know I will only use this oil for my face &amp; body!</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my natural African American, type 4A curly hair.  I dont really know if it has benefited my hair or not. I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge difference.  I also tried it mixed in my facial moisturizer and it made me break out.  Probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this oil made my face break out horribly and made my hair a greasy mess. That being said, I&#x27;m a natural redhead with straight hair and a fair complexion so maybe that had something to do with my reaction to this product.  It seems to work for the majority of readers so I say why not give it a try ;) Good luck.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on my skin and hair!  It makes my skin soft without feeling oily and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
    <li> At one time II was able to afford high end beauty supply products- name brands Sephora, etc. as well as professional facials. I can no longer afford such expensive products/services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, I started reading extensive reviews, watching Utube for suggestions( i.e. this is where I learned that the Monistat Chafting gel has the same ingredients as Sephora&#x27;s primer (is actually better with less additives), etc., and started purchasing Amazon products that are extremely cost effective and in some cases the same product used when I had professional treatment, i.e. 35% Glycolic Acid, Emu oil, Argan Oil, Squalane, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results - if used properly - provide me the same results as professional treatment. Highly recommend these products but caution to read the reviews, especially on peel products such as the Glycolic Acid, so you do not damage skin and get exceptional results.</li>
    <li> Amazed with this product.  Perfect for curly, frizzy hair.  You just need a small amount on you hand a place on the ends.  Amazing I had tried other products wasn&#x27;t happy this is great.</li>
    <li> Way too oily for me:( My hair stuck together. I tried even using very little...nope no luck, my hair got stuck together again and I have a white girls frizzy over processed hair. So I used it on my feet! I guess at least one use for this thing! Too oily!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find this beneficial to my face. Left it dry.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hands and nails.&lt;br /&gt;Is just ok.</li>
    <li> Great product.. This was my first... I got 8 oz when buying it second time since I use it for my and my daughter long hair, hand moisturizes, for face ( 20-30 mins &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;), and nails... Mix it with creams, other natural oils for your specific needs...&lt;br /&gt;Must have in my house...</li>
    <li> This is wonderful to assist in reducing wrinkle lines around the lips and eyes.  I start my regimen with a clean face, toned, then a few drops of Hyualuronic Serum, then add the Argon Oil!  The Serum attracts moisture into the skin and the Argan Oil moisturizes, replenishes the oils without feeling greasy, and assists in reducing the signs of aging.</li>
    <li> Great product, my girlfriend uses it every day. It helps your face look younger and healthier. It shipped fast and got here on time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with the overpriced Josie Maran, i have used both and this is excellent and top quality</li>
    <li> i put it on my wet hair after washing then blow dried hair  felt nice no frizz and i mixed some into my shea butter all over lotion i made</li>
    <li> I use Argan oil on my face &amp; neck.  It is not greasy &amp; absorbs nicely into the skin.  There is no heavy smell or feel... and it&#x27;s pure</li>
    <li> The product is nice, but it is thicker than I expected. I was hoping for something that would be a bit more liquid and go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately a little does not go a long way. I am going to see if I can add something to it, that will thin it out. It smells lovely and moisturizes well, but I end up rubbing more into my hands trying to spread it out so I can put it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea, it&#x27;s about the same consistency as pure glycerin.</li>
    <li> This is as good as any Argan Oil I have tried.  It is a fantastic moisturizer, and I won&#x27;t let myself run out.  I&#x27;ve found this to be true of both the Timeless products I have tried, and am looking forward to trying more.</li>
    <li> After using this for over 18 months I am a total believer.  This is a super product.  It is rich, but not oily.  A little goes a loooong way.  Read the other reviews.  They are true.  You will notice positive changes in your skin after a single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drops on your fingertips and pat in on your face and neck.  No oily residue.  Your skin will look fresher, plumper, with less wrinkles, and yes, less acne.  Both my adult daughter and I still suffer from adult acne.  I stopped trying to dry things up and now use this Argan oil faithfully.  Acne flare ups and much fewer and last a day or two instead of week.  I sent this to my daughter and she reports the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I both have long hair (see my profile pic).  A few drops of this pure Argan oil into damp hair and the blow dry cannot harm me.  My hair is super soft and actually really healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product at a great price.  You will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update a year after original review:  I still use this product faithfully everyday on my face and in fresh-washed hair.  After using this for more than 18 months in conjunction with this company&#x27;s 100% pure hyaluronic serum, [[ASIN:B003MJ7Z0O The Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz.]]I have much younger-looking skin.  It is by far softer and brighter.  I use even more than a few drops of Argan oil on my skin now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I gift both of the products to my young friends suffering from adult acne and my older friends who have tried many expensive creams and serums and have yet to achieve the results from these two simple products.  My daughter and stepdaughter both swear by them and every friend has thanked me.</li>
    <li> Packaging looks simple but product feels good.  Its not oily and there is no unpleasant odour.  Hair feels softer with several days of application.  More importantly, it did not arrive with leaks.  Will reorder again.</li>
    <li> I use this at night, whether I&#x27;m working at night or going to sleep, and in the day time, I wash and use my regular face lotion... I have a dry skin condition that is beginning to affect my face, but that has now come to a halt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is all natural, one drop goes aloooooong way, and it absorbs very quickly... I love it... oh, and it arrived a day after I&#x27;ve ordered it hahaha</li>
    <li> Bought this for winter skin.  The reviews do say, a little goes a long way.  It sure does.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t absorb well; seems to sit on the skin. Leaves are really oily feeling and shine. It&#x27;s great though if you have winter damaged skin on your hands or arms but any quality skin lotion does just as well.</li>
    <li> I have only used the oil on my natural kinky/curly hair for a say but I really like it. The oil is really rich and I don&#x27;t need as much as I do when I apply olive oil to my hair. great product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of Argan oil products, that have Argan as the 3rd, 4th or sometimes last ingredient and they only worked so so. This Pure Argan Oil was EXCELLENT on my hair. It has saved my hair and healed it some magical way. I am sure its because its pure oil. If it isn&#x27;t pure it works like Argan is suppose to and better than other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it and use; then Thank me later.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil in general, but got tired of paying such a high price for the better known brands. The trouble is, a lot of the cheap brands smell funny.  This brand lived up to my expectations and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  I use this after my peptide serum - just a couple drops - and it&#x27;s a great light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne (which I get easily). Alone, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for oily or acne prone skin; added to another moisturizer, it adds additional moisturizing properties to the product. Also, there was a cream I purchased that was lumpy and didn&#x27;t spread well on my skin, so I added a couple drops of this oil every time I used the cream, and it dissolved all the lumps.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin feel and look great, I don&#x27;t have any of those creepy lines on my chest anymore. I use this after the hyaluronic acid serum does good job.</li>
    <li> This oil is a must for skin care.  It can be used all over your body and hair, without greasy and/or heavy residue.  Argan oil absorbs readily into the skin and leaves it silky soft and feeling amazing!  I use it after applying Hyaluronic Serum on my face as a moisturizer, also my nails and cuticles.  If you have very dry or damaged skin on your face, you may want to use another moisturizer as well...in that case you can add a few drops to it.  I love this oil, its very soothing and rich, but sinks in quickly and makes your skin feel and look amazing!  I am never going to be without it!</li>
    <li> My skin was so dry and my face had red patches. I love this oil.  My skin is softer and is no longer dry.  The oil is not too thick or thin.</li>
    <li> I suffered from dry skin all my life and was looking for products I can use with my daily facial moisturizer.  This is one of the products I found to be helpful.  It is highly concentrated, so one can use very little.  When applying, I concentrate on the eyes, lips and mouth areas, blend it in, then use my daily moisturizer over it.  It&#x27;s a great product.  It will last me a while as it&#x27;s so concentrated.  Others may not need this 2-step system, but I know I do.  It&#x27;s been very helpful for me.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive combination skin. In the winter, I somehow manage to have an oily forehead and a very dry, flaky nose at the same time. Compensating for one usually comes at the expense of the other. I&#x27;ve started adding a drop of argan oil to my regular moisturizer and it takes care of the dry skin without turning my forehead into an oil slick. It&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly. I haven&#x27;t had any problem using it under makeup. A little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil in my daily beauty routine for about six months. I started with a sample size from a higher end brand but as I found different ways to use argan oil in my routine, I decided to invest in a larger size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been hunting for a decent quality argan oil for a cheaper price for a couple months. I&#x27;ve tried different versions that claim to be 100% pure argan, only to receive the bottle and realize it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to finally find a larger-size bottle without the high price tag! :) First off, the quality is almost as good as the higher end version. This oil was not as soft as the higher end version I normally use, but it works just as well. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair - I have curly hair that frizzes up and dries out very easily - for a couple days and already noticed a difference in my locks. My hair is shinier, silkier and smoother - plus no more frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this version on my skin - on my heels, elbows and knees as those parts tend to dry out, especially with the winter air. This keeps my skin soft and moisturized throughout the day. You can layer this under your regular moisturizer or lotion to beef up the performance or try it alone. Tip to try: layer the oil on your feet after a hot shower in the evening and slather on some thick heel/foot cream. Throw on some socks and head to bed. By morning your feet will feel soft, smooth and supple. I plan on doing this weekly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hesitant to try this on my face, though. I have acne-prone skin that gets finicky easily. I use a lighter version of the high end argan oil on my face, alternating between AM and PM. This feels too heavy for my face, although I may try the oil under my eyes as one reviewer suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this just for a couple days but all over my body, and still there&#x27;s plenty left in the bottle. I&#x27;m hopeful this will last a long time, but since the price is right, I don&#x27;t mind having to purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great buy - decent quality oil at an awesome price. Looks like you can buy refills from the manufacturer too; it&#x27;s always nice to find ways to stretch your beauty budget!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ordered this product from this company. I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone. The order came on time and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> Conditions and hydrates my skin and even lips beautifully. I love it. The use of the argon oil even helped heal old scars.</li>
    <li> Good product but bottle came broken. Maybe one one cushion.It opened in the box and then spilled. Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I added drops of this, Vitamin E oil and the hyaluronic acid (which is in all potent expensive creams) to my lotion, eye cream, and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have bleached blonde hair and live in Florida - perfect combination for a frizz.  I tried different Argan oils before getting this one and the reason I love this particular one is that it makes my hair not only silky and frizz free but also adds volume.  And you really have to use just a few drops to get the results - that is another big plus, as 2oz bottle will last you a while.</li>
    <li> I had been using an Argan Oil that cost $50 for 2 oz. from a tv shopping channel.  I loved what I had but it was too expensive.  I searched Amazon and found this nice bottle, the same size as what I had been using, for only $15.  When it came, I tested the two oils -- put one on top of one hand and one on top of the other and left it for about 15 minutes.  I was pleasantly surprised when I felt my hands to discover this Argan Oil was actually much softer than the more expensive oil!  I&#x27;m so glad to have found this oil -- now I can use it and not feel guilty about the cost.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil isn&#x27;t greasy on your face. It does a good job of moisturizing your hands and face without breakouts.</li>
    <li> Been using Argan oil now for several years and I always come back to this vendor... this stuff is the same as the more expensive stuff. After about a year of using Argan Oil a few times a week, I noticed that my eyelashes and eyebrows appeared thicker!!! So, I started using it daily after wiping off my eye makeup, and I love how long and full my eyelashes and brows have gotten. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it!!!</li>
    <li> I was not please with this product at all. I really don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s pure Argan Oil, I have used Argan Oil before. This  is to greasy !!!!!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> Like the way it feels on my skin - not greasy at all.  Absorbs quickly.  Also use it on my nails before bed.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> If your looking for soft manageable hair if you buy this you will buy again when you run out its pure it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it, it doesn&#x27;t rub off quick it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> this is the second time i own it ,ti is very good ,i like it very much ,i&#x27;m 32 years old</li>
    <li> For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been getting keratin treatments 2-3 times a years to help control my thick, curly, frizzy hair.  I thought I had found my dream product last year when I purchased a bottle of Biosilk.  It wasn&#x27;t until after I purchased this small little bottle of magic that I realized none of the 10 other oil products I have used on my hair since the keratin treatments, including my once favorite Biosilk, has ever made my hair NEARLY as healthy, silky, soft, and shiny as the Argan.  With prior oils, if instructions said use a dime size portion, I would measure out a teaspoon.  After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to start with just a few drops (though honestly not expecting it would make any noticeable difference in my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After towel drying my hair, I applied three drops, blow dried then flat ironed my hair.  As I styled my hair, I knew this stuff was special.  My hair felt soft, and had a healthy shine.  After flat ironing, I think it was close to impossible for anyone to tell that my natural hair is a frizzy, curly mess.  My dry, split ends also appeared healthy and shiny for the first time in 10 years.  NO other product has been able to penetrate my ends like this.  Argan oil has easily replaced at least five products that were once part of my daily hair routine.  No, it doesn&#x27;t have a pretty sweet smell; it doesn&#x27;t smell at all, and you know what? That&#x27;s perfectly okay with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip about frequency of applying... I would reapply as frequently as you wash your hair.  On the second day of using this product, I applied three more drops to my hair (with my old products, I was always adding more the following day).  On day two, my hair felt like it had too much oil.  Now, I only reapply of a certain part of my hair feels drier than the rest or if my ends need some touching up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I saw this product worked, and how amazing the results were, I shipped a second bottle to my mom.  All in all, couldn&#x27;t be happier and I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it for my hair. I have very dry hair due to coloring and daily washing and blow drying. I mix the Argan oil with my conditioner. My hair is starting to get softer and shiny. I just started using this oil for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is equal to any high price Argan Oil.  I am 66 with dry skin.  The skin on my cheek bones was becoming rough and dryer as I age.  Creams have not helped so I thought I would try this.  I gave myself a facial scrub, applied this and in 15 minutes there was no oily feeling and my skin was very soft and much smoother.  A few drops goes a long way.  No fragrance so you know this is a \\&quot;pure\\&quot; product. I use Reviva Rosewater Facial Spray throughout the day and surprisingly it seems to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; the oil and my makeup looks freshly applied.  This oil can be used anywhere on the body or hair. I won&#x27;t be without this oil.</li>
    <li> it leaves my skin soft. I was very surprised how fast absorb and does&#x27;t leave my skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;I give it only 4 star because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin, I have to use another cream after I put it on otherwise my face feel very dry</li>
    <li> I have used REAL Argan oil before and this IS NOT IT!&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is NOT Greasy and this is a greasy mess!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IF U WANT REAL ARGAN OIL, SPEND A LITTLE MORE $$ FOR IT!&lt;br /&gt;A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!</li>
    <li> 3 drops is all it takes- and it actually helped my acne , jars are pretty so it looks nice on the countertop</li>
    <li> This product does not do much and it does not vanish into the surface of skin at all. I should just use olive oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and my hair is already shiny, smooth and so much easier to run a brush through. Since it worked so well on my hair I thought I&#x27;d try it on my body. I added some to my lotion and use it in the morning after a shower. My skin looks great all day, my lotion before would only keep my skin looking moisturized for a couple of hours. I&#x27;ve found an inexpensive solution to keep my hair &amp; skin looking great in this dry desert, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> The Argan oil is great. I add it to my body lotion and as an extra moisturizer. But, the glass portion of the dropper shattered when I hit it while removing it from the bottle. The bad news is that the glass fell into the bottle. Maybe that&#x27;s the good news since I didn&#x27;t cut myself?</li>
    <li> I have fine, highlighted blonde hair and I am a straightening iron addict. I have dry, frizzy split ends. I have been using a few drops of this oil on damp hair after washing (too much will make hair greasy - a little goes a long way) to help reduce frizz when styling. Several times a week I also re-apply to mid-lengths and ends before bed for a more intensive treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using on my face as well, but it leaves my skin a little greasy. Maybe ok for overnight treatment. For my hair, I love it and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it, great body oil and ends of hair</li>
    <li> I like this Argan oil, hope it is the real thing. Used on face and in hair.</li>
    <li> This product is equal to any high price Argan Oil. No fragrance so you know this is a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; product.  This oil can be used anywhere on the body or hair.</li>
    <li> The oil came in a clear glass container, which is incorrect, it needs to be in a dark container because light is damaging to the oil.  I had to change the bottle.  Now I don&#x27;t know if the oil has lost its integrity due to improper storage.</li>
    <li> apparently my wife ordered this on my account so i cant give any first hand knowledge but i can say that i havent heard her complain about it so i assume she likes it... while at the same time i havent heard her praise it so i have to assume it was just okay.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of all the good reviews, and have to agree, that it&#x27;s a great product.  I mix it with my am &amp; pm face creams, as well as with my body lotion.  Makes my skin really soft.</li>
    <li> Very light and it&#x27;s 100%, which is a plus.  I use it for my hair and my nails.</li>
    <li> I bought Timeless Argan oil before I purchased the Josie Maran $48 Pure Argan oil. Imagined my surprise when the Josie Maran not only worked, but actually ABSORBED into my skin. Not to mention that it smelled like Argan oil should. Timeless is lying to you all. It&#x27;s literally packaged cooking oil- smells just like vegetable oil above my stove. Do not waste your money, buy the real thing. Argan oil is manually made and therefore is expensive, but the real stuff is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and love it! I&#x27;ve bought the expensive argan oil at the mall before and returned it because didn&#x27;t like how it made my skin break out. Before I purchased this I read the reviews by other customers on how to use it around the eye area not just all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know how to use the oil without making my skin breakout, I love it. I use it on my arms, legs and neck have noticed skin is glowing and feels so soft!!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product &amp; I will be ordering this again,,,it is very good for my skin &amp; this is my first experience...it makes my skin soft &amp; vibrant &amp; will hope that , this product helps my skin further... ..Doctors recommend this product is true to its word on line &amp; with all the products out in the market it gets very confusing to know what really works &amp; what doesn&#x27;t...and the fact is , you dont need to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to buy a good product that works....I have researched this product on line &amp; it is a lot more expensive, I think the price on amazon was great!...thank you Amazon...you have the best prices for Products on the Net!...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rare for me to describe a product as miraculous, but Argan Oil really works wonders for my skin and hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, and I can definitely see a difference.  My skin looks healthier - even-toned and with less of those &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34; lines.  I just mix 4 or 5 drops with my retin-a cream to use before bed, or 2 drops in my daytime moisturizer.  I let it dry for about 10 minutes and then apply my foundation as usual.  My face is naturally oily, but this product (unlike other &amp;#34;non-oily&amp;#34; products) doesn&#x27;t make me shine too much (although I do blot my skin with kleenex and/or pressed powder throughout the day.)  For my long, baby-fine hair, I warm up about a tablespoon in the microwave for 10 seconds and apply it to wet hair.  I cover my hair with a shower cap and a hot towel for at least 30 minutes and then use a conditioning cleanser. (I don&#x27;t use shampoo.)  My hair is definitely healthier and shinier since I started using Argan Oil.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Nice viscosity, no scent, just a small amount works wonders on my split ends. And it came in adorable packaging so this would make a cute gift. Definitely recommend if you like Argan oil. Same quality as Watt&#x27;s if not better.</li>
    <li> Liquid gold!!! It works wonderfully on skin and hair - especially hair!!</li>
    <li> I got this product way faster than anything else I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon ( and I order a lot), ordered on a Saturday got in on Monday.I have baby fine, thin hair. This oil really makes a difference. I use a few drops of it after I towel dry my hair, and work it in. It keeps my hair from breaking and it feels fuller. It works great on my face too, leaves it supersoft and its not greasy.I will definately order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> This product, in conjunction with hylauronic acid, has totally transformed my skin! I have combination skin, oily areas, dry patches, occasional breakouts.....I mix a few drops on each and apply to clean skin as a serum, then follow with my regular cetaphil moisturizer.....after 1 week I saw an incredible change! The argan oil acts as an antibacterial so my breakouts are gone, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Well worth it</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this product for the price and the size of the bottle!!!  I sue it for my neck area.</li>
    <li> good product. my skin did not break out or have any type of redness after using it. my sister also uses this product and she loves it</li>
    <li> Feels light on my hair and face.  Make combing through easy. Does not make my face or hair feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time I was using a product that contained Argan oil from Sally&#x27;s on my hair when using a hot iron.  I liked it for that purpose, but wanted something I could use on my skin at night. I thought to myself, if this stuff is as good as the claims are, why dilute it with other nonsense? A quick search online and I saw the prices range from $30-150 for small quantities, in unknown concentration. I was happy to find this product at this price and even happier when the product exceeded my expectations. I now have incorporated this a few drops of this oil into all of my usual skin and hair care treatments and am loving the results. My hair is shiny and doesn&#x27;t frizz, and my skin is hydrated, but not oily/greasy. Some light scarring on my chin has started to lighten despite sun exposure. I&#x27;m no scientist, and this is no study, but I really like it! There is a slight scent to the oil - a scent that I happen to enjoy, but is not what I would consider aromatic by any stretch. The oil from Sally&#x27;s had additional fragrance added and I smelled flowery, where this is more nutty and doesn&#x27;t linger. The bottle came in a clear box with shredded paper keeping the bottle from rattling or getting damaged by the other Amazon items I purchased. I can&#x27;t yet speak to the consistency of the quality of oil from this vendor, as I am only now thinking about ordering my second bottle. I&#x27;m really glad that I tried this oil, because I&#x27;ve definitely wasted more money on products that were completely worthless...it&#x27;s nice to find one that is inexpensive, but  works for my needs.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my face for acne and fine lines. I started a month prior with the Hylauronic acid, then added this. They say not to add more than one item at a time. The HA has been great, but I think the argan oil may cause my to break out just a little. Nothing severe like the acne I&#x27;m used to but definitely doesn&#x27;t keep my face clear. I also tried this in my hair and I feel it made it look too oily, but that could just be my personal hair type. I will try again with this on my face in localized areas where I have some small lines. I don&#x27;t give up easily.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.  Realized I didn&#x27;t have to pay some of the pricey make up line version of the same thing.</li>
    <li> I use it to moisturize my face in the daytime and nighttime. Glass dropper. Good product. Would recommend. Got here fast!</li>
    <li> I have been using the argan oil on my dry skin, under eyes and as a hot oil hair treatment. In just one week I have noticed a difference in the appearance and condition of both my skin and hair. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> like the other brands a little better.  thicker than most and more greasy than other brands, doesn&#x27;t absorb as quick as other brands</li>
    <li> This is my first time using argan oil so I can&#x27;t say whether or not there is a better brand out there.  I can only speak to this one.  I primarily use it under my eyes instead of the more costly eye creams.  I have to say that it really does seem to minimize dryness and wrinkles.  Probably not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for wrinkles but it works while I&#x27;m &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34; it.  I do have to be careful to apply it lower so it doesn&#x27;t get into my eyes.  When that happens, it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything but I feel like I need to put in some drops to clear my eyes.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as an addition to more potent eye creams to replenish the under eye skin.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I use it daily and along with my derma roller..my skin soaks it all in..i have a glow to my skin and its not oily.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> my skin turned to be softer/brighter after just one time use, very good product,if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on brand, this is a very good choice.</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin and my hair,it absorbs well and is not too oily. Great quality. I add some to my body moisturizer for more hydration and rub a little into my hair before bed for extra silky hair.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel smooth not greasy. Use it on your body after a shower, use on hair for deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> This is a very affordable product from this particular seller.  With the popularity of argan oil as of late many retailers are price-gouging.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and this product, as well as the seller.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Mix this nightly with my moisturizer. My skin feels and looks very well hydrated. Add it to my shampoo sometimes. Can also just apply directly to skin. A super all around natural moisturizer at a great price.</li>
</ol>
