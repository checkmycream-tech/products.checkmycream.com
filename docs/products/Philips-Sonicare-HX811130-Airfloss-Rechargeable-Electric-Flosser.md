      <li>My gums feel awesome after 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>others have said, you can use mouthwash and I&#x27;ve found this to be the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes quite a bit of use and practice to learn how to best use the Airfloss and maximize its effectiveness.</li>
      <li>The dentist was impressed with the results of the Airfloss and told me to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What a great product!!!</li>

      <li>I figured that Philip would make a water flosser as great as their toothbrushes..</li>
      <li>Conceptually it may be a great idea - and that is what inspired me to buy it, but functionally, you could damage your gums/teeth.</li>

      <li>Works great, my dentist noticed great improvement in my gums</li>
      <li>This is a great device</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product when it&#x27;s working.</li>
      <li>buying this product two years ago, I am happy to report (based on my yearly  teeth cleaning today)  </li>
      <li>Happily, I bought the Airfloss as soon as I got the offer from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Maria Menoonouse on television must be getting paid by Sonicare for having said this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>I chose water which still cleans out between my teeth and provides that awesome clean feeling!  </li>
      <li>I also use this filled with a fluoride after-brushing rinse, to get the fluoride in between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution---this unit is best used with your mouth</li>
      <li>but good.</li>
      <li>Bought this product and loved it.  </li>
      <li>The Airfloss feels so good</li>
      <li>and my gums look good.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it maybe 10 times, her even fewer, and I can&#x27;t see how it does me any good after using GUM soft-picks and brushing with the Sonicare.</li>
      <li>Good battery life also.</li>
      <li>For a person who doesn&#x27;t like to floss, this is a good alternative.  </li>
      <li>The water reservoir cap does not provide a good seal so the unit will leak in a travel bag.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not to mention it feels good.</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping to get a good quality equivalent of a rechargeable Water Pik.  </li>
      <li>this product seemed like a good idea.  </li>
      <li>I received the product in good conditions, without hits or damages, but after add water</li>
      <li>so I was expecting good things from the Airfloss.</li>
      <li>a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The good news is Phillips is replacing it.</li>
      <li>When I went after ~13 years, the doctor was amazed at how good my teeth looked.  </li>
      <li>That being said, I was hesitant to move over to this when my hygienist said it was probably a good idea.  </li>
      <li>I hope that it continues to do a good job as it has been.</li>
      <li>excellent product, very useful</li>
      <li>that seems to be the best, and keeps it clean.</li>
      <li>this was the best investment I could have ever made, thanks to my dentist&#x27;s recommendation!!</li>
      <li>A healthy routine which alway seemed a chore has become a welcome habit.</li>
      <li>I have braces and thought the air floss would be perfect - and it is pretty good...</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I liked how it worked and was a good match with my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This is an incredible way to clean around teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>If not, you will love this Product!</li>
      <li>However, I seemed more successful at dislodging items with the Airfloss.  </li>
      <li>I thought I don&#x27;t have to floss any more, but...... my dentist said: Yes, you do!</li>
      <li>my bathroom, it needs to be streamlined quite a bit more!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>However, after brush I use the AirFloss and within just 60 seconds, an amazing amount of debris is removed with this flossing device.  </li>
      <li>I use mouthwash instead of water, the pulse of air and mouthwash does an effective job.</li>
      <li>The pulse blast cannot be varied, like the WaterPik, but it is quite effective.</li>
      <li>This thing is awesome and really gets a lot of junk out after brushing with my sonicare .</li>
      <li>This unit worked nicely up until ripe age of 18 months or so.</li>
      <li>Even in my own bathroom at home, I can&#x27;t see myself liking something like that.</li>
      <li>Ordered it, liked it until about the 5th fime</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a highly effective tool</li>
      <li>It would be nice if it came with a travel case.</li>
      <li>(nice)</li>
      <li>I chatted with an online representative and they recommended filling the reservoir with warm water to see if that &amp;#34;recharged&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>When it worked, it was great and really seemed to do a good job.  </li>
      <li>This product is great, quick, does the trick and help flossing with water or using mouth wash products.</li>
      <li>Airfloss provides my mouth with a clean, incredible feeling and keeps my gums strong and protected against gum diseases.  </li>
      <li>I wondered if the Airflosser would be more effective than string flossing.  </li>
      <li>and we each now own a Toilettree irrigator, which we both love.  </li>
      <li>water pik plus much more effective.  </li>
      <li>it should be an amazing addition to healthy mouth care.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think this thing worked (I use that in the past tense) increasingly well. I have gum recession problems and when I concentrated on using this tool, it cleaned my gum line really well. The catch is, that the frickin batteries died (on both of them) - had to chuck them.</li>
    <li> I have braces and thought the air floss would be perfect - and it is pretty good...just not sure I would spend $80 on it again.  It doesn&#x27;t feel as solid as my Sonicare brush.  I like it, and it does an okay job, I just had higher hopes for something from Sonicare.  The head doesn&#x27;t fit tightly and thing kind of loosely sits on the charger.  When it shoots water there is a vibration inside that sounds like a spring after it snaps back.  I&#x27;d like it better for less than $40.</li>
    <li> Conceptually it may be a great idea - and that is what inspired me to buy it, but functionally, you could damage your gums/teeth. There is no way to adjust the pressure and the preset pressure is very forceful. It may inflict damage on your teeth - and if you miss the target, your gums. Owwwwwwwwwww!</li>
    <li> I need to use a mechanical flosser because my orthodontist jammed my teeth so close together that you can&#x27;t ever slip a razor blade between my teeth (bad idea, don&#x27;t try it). The dental assistants at my dentist&#x27;s office can do it, but they have a lot of practice with all kinds of teeth. Anyway, I had been using the Water Pik Water Flosser for years. When its battery gave up the ghost, I thought I&#x27;d try this.&lt;br /&gt;What a mistake. Every time you go to a tooth it makes a \\&quot;clomp\\&quot; sound. You don&#x27;t get the feeling there&#x27;s any deep cleaning going on. Plus it&#x27;s an unpleasant feeling. Then when you do the back teeth, especially on the bottom, you hit areas that are very sensitive and it just plain hurts. The is no way to adjust the machine to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have sent it back, but I threw away the box.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m buying another Water Pik Flosser, which was superior in every way!</li>
    <li> This sounded good on paper but practically it was fairly worthless. It allows you do shoot water in between your teeth about 30 times before it runs out of water and the power behind the shots is fairly feeble. Not very satisfying. It came with a money back warranty and I spent a lot of time and energy;several phone calls and emails, and regular mail sending back documentation to finally get my money back 3-4 months later. Overall a frustrating experience. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product; it leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh; It&#x27;s easy to use, highly recommend, great buy.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have been using sonicare for the better part of my life.  I have been a long time user of their electric brushes.  I have gone through a couple of different water flosser and while I liked the results they were very bulky and sprayed water all over the place.  I figured that Philip would make a water flosser as great as their toothbrushes.. wow was I wrong.  Not only where there was little or no pressure, the head of the flosser actually broke off only after 2 uses.  I was not even putting a lot of pressure against my gums.. For that price which is at least $40 more than any other water flosser it should be an amazing addition to healthy mouth care.  What a rip off.  Maybe the next generation of floss systems will be a better design.</li>
    <li> Works great, my dentist noticed great improvement in my gums</li>
    <li> my dental hygienist suggested this for me since I have some tight spaces that make it hard to use floss since it usually catches and shreds.Well, it turns out those same tight spaces are also hard to get the nozzle positioned so the air/water blows through - a few places it sort of blocks the outflow and it makes a weird noise. But for most spaces it does work fine and the ability to add some mouthwash to it makes it decent tool to add to the dental care regimen. wish the reservoir was easier to fill - it is a bit messy and/or awkward and if overfilled, then closing the cap will squeeze out the excess. Frankly I prefer using the flossers that are &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shaped with the floss spanning the open end and a small molded handle - yes, I shred a bit of floss at the tight spots but at least I am sure it gets through - with this I do not feel the fluids coming through those few tight spots.</li>
    <li> The Airfloss feels so good I use it two to three times a day. So nice to have a clean, minty fresh mouth without having to stick my fingers in with floss.</li>
    <li> It broke down after 2 weeks. It simply doesn&#x27;t work anymore, I press the button nothing happens.</li>
    <li> excellent product, very useful</li>
    <li> Does its job, although I think using regular dental floss would do the same job for 1/2 the price. It can be a bit messy so watch when you use product and don&#x27;t lay down on its side without making sure its closed, water and/or mouthwash may spill out.</li>
    <li> use it everyday, like a cool breeze flowing through my teeth</li>
    <li> This really helped improve my gums</li>
    <li> I know you&#x27;re not supposed to get it too wet, but I figured like my Sonicare toothbrush (which is awesome) I could handle it. Went through two of them, most likely because of water damage. Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> This flosser has a very small reservoir, and it squirts only one per button push.  There is room for improvement in this design.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased this item.</li>
    <li> I received the product in good conditions, without hits or damages, but after add water the &amp;#34;air&amp;#34;floss just spray that.. air</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my Dentist to clean above the gum line around my molars.  I was shocked to see how must debris was removed by this &amp;#34;flosser&amp;#34;!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> used this item for a few weeks and love it, some what messy at first. Use the mouth wash in it. that seems to be the best, and keeps it clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Phillips Sonic Care Airfloss for about 3 weeks.  I love it so much that I ordered an Airfloss set and split the pieces with my sister so I could have one for work.  The Airfloss is the easiest way to clean between teeth quickly; including the back teeth that is hard to get to with thread floss.  A burst of air and water is shot in between the teeth for a refreshing clean; you can use mouthwash or water.  I highly recommend the Airfloss to everyone as it seems to remove 99% debris than just brushing and thread flossing.  I figured the Airfloss was as excellent as the Sonic Care toothbrushes that I have been using for years and have kept my teeth in great condition.</li>
    <li> I much prefer the Waterpic. Used this product for 6+ times and couldn&#x27;t get that feeling of a satisfied cleaned/flossed feeling. I don&#x27;t bother to use this. Will give this away. Back to my old faithful standby- the Waterpic.</li>
    <li> The puff is way too strong. It actually made my gums bleed from the pressure. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all.Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have needed to replace handle 3 times in 9 months. My husband is on his fourth. The mechanics of this thing is not good although I like what it does.  We are pretty gentle with it but to no avail.</li>
    <li> I love this flosser but it does not like me. Believe it or not since the past 2 years I purchased 9 of them, yes nine of these flossers. I put them in all our bathrooms in our two houses. So far 7 of them have stopped working after a few months. Fortunately they are under warranty by Philips for 2 years. Philips does not make it easy to obtain a replacement of the faulty flosser since they ask a lots of questions, some of them quite silly. Lately since my name has been flagged for having requested the replacement of 6 flossers, Philips asked me to send proof of purchase. Usually the number under the flosser is sufficient for Philips..I may decide in the future to stop using the Sonicare flosser if they continue to break and Philips is giving me hard time to replace them.</li>
    <li> Hate it. Returned to Phillips and went back to the waterpik.. It didn&#x27;t make my teeth to feel clean. I would mouthwash afterwards and more stuff would still come out. Waterpik is way better and a lot less. Waterpik is more messy because of the amount of water but it works. This airfloss is not worth it. My guns are even healthier with the new waterpik it got. :)</li>
    <li> Every doctor says floosing is very important but we still don&#x27;t do it mainly for being lazy. This product is great, quick, does the trick and help flossing with water or using mouth wash products. This is a must have</li>
    <li> I am very positive about all the offerings of Sonicare, and this is no exception---well made, easy to use and easy to keep clean.  I use this as an adjunct to regular flossing.  I like the way one can fill it with any wash you prefer.  Generally, I use one of the foaming whitening mouthrinses right before I brush.  The pulses are quite vigorous, and clean out food particles that even flossing leaves behind.  I also use this filled with a fluoride after-brushing rinse, to get the fluoride in between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution---this unit is best used with your mouth closed, i.e., you &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; your way along from one tooth space to the next.  Using this with an open mouth in front of a mirror creates quite a mess!</li>
    <li> As a person that is not big into flossing manually, I&#x27;ve come to love using this machine.  The fact that you only need a small amount of water makes this convenient and the charge lasts a good long time.</li>
    <li> Useless product. Does not hold enough water for a full mouth flossing. Water squirts everywhere. Handle is hard to hold and direct. Very poor design. Can someone design a flossing product that is easy to hold and use?</li>
    <li> Always hated to floss with string.  This air floss does a great job and I love to put Act Restore wash in it.  The water/wash space is too small but other than that it is great.  The battery stays charged for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flosser in July of 13. After 8 months it will not hold a charge.....dead! I have contacted customer service (twice) through their online chat, and have provided a copy of the Amazon receipt that they requested. I have also emailed them 3 times without a response. (This all started around April 16th) Their customer service is shameful when compared to most other company&#x27;s that I have dealt with. I must admit that it worked great for the 8 months that I owned it.....but only for 8 months!!!</li>
    <li> Not very powerful, the head breaks very easily and is not covered under the warranty so beware-you will probably find yourself having to order a new one soon.</li>
    <li> Does a poor job of cleaning . The Flosser requires a great deal of effort to obtain minimal results of cleanliness.</li>
    <li> Stopped functionning after 6 months. Was replaced by Philips for no additional charge. Works fine up to now. Would recommend product for easy oral care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 years. It&#x27;s worked great the entire time. Quite the time saver when I just don&#x27;t feel motivated enough to use dental floss. I had a small issue recently where it stopped working. I chatted with an online representative and they recommended filling the reservoir with warm water to see if that &amp;#34;recharged&amp;#34; the Airfloss. It did. Amazing that such a simple solution got my Airfloss working again. My opinion of this Philips product just went up.</li>
    <li> It is messy.  Dental floss is much less expensive and works&lt;br /&gt;much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My molars have a lot of fillings on the tops that make it almost impossible to get floss between them. The Airfloss blasts air and mouthwash through the gap from the outside, solving the problem. I used to hate to floss with a piece of string. I avoided it until I was due for a checkup. With the Airfloss, it is so quick, easy, and painless that it has become part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - After using it for a year, the handle started to crack. I contacted the company via their website chat feature and they sent a replacement, no problem. My gums don&#x27;t bleed when I brush, like they used to. I&#x27;ll never go back to using string.</li>
    <li> This worked for me for about a month.  Then it strained to move internally (before, you could hear it wind up for each blast), and now it won&#x27;t do anything.  Maybe I got a lemon, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> This unit worked nicely up until ripe age of 18 months or so. Easy to keep the hard to reach pockets between molars clean and useful when combined with traditional flossing. Specifically if you like to eat seeds like chia and hemp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the microswitch on activation button decided to die just outside of 12 months warranty period. If this behavior is planned obsolescence then Philips engineers have nailed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should the usable life been 36 months or so I would have give this device 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and keep clean!  It works well in those hard to reach places and you can use any liquid in it.  I love to use mouthwash to keep my mouth fresh.</li>
    <li> I received my Sonicare Feb 2013.  It&#x27;s Jan 2014, and after using it less than I year it just stopped working. When it worked, it was great and really seemed to do a good job.  However, I will try another brand for my next flosser since this one didn&#x27;t last nearly long enough. I usually used it twice a day - and didn&#x27;t miss many days.  That should not have worn it out!!!!</li>
    <li> Hard to know if it cleans between teeth and under gums as advertised. NO way to check.  Easy enough to use and charge though. C. Eves</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really care for this product.  Way too messy.</li>
    <li> I used this for several months before seeing the dentist and I was informed I had several cavities between my teeth due to inadequate brushing. After telling her that I was using this product, she said it was not performing well and was not cleaning between my teeth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did research the matter and Sonicare&#x27;s website says this: \\&quot;While Sonicare AirFloss has not been designed to directly replace floss in all aspects (e.g. removal of large debris from in-between teeth) it is an excellent alternative for daily interproximal cleaning.\\&quot; This statement seems odd because, if anything, I found the AirFloss did remove food from between my teeth, but apparently did not do an adequate job of other types of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After switching back to regular floss, I went back to the dentist and this visit she remarked that my teeth were cleaner than hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that Sonicare only offers a 90 day money back guarantee on this -- and since most dental insurance only covers two visits a year, you could be outside the money back period by the time you see your dentist to see if it is working for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I have used the Sonicare Pro brush for years and I have been very happy with it. My dentist approves of it as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I thought, it doesn&#x27;t do much, definitely doesn&#x27;t floss well</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to get a good quality equivalent of a rechargeable Water Pik.  I don&#x27;t have any quality issues with this yet but it doesn&#x27;t work enough like the Water Pik.  The last Water Pik I bought lasted 2 months and died completely.  I don&#x27;t understand why someone doesn&#x27;t take the neat concept of a Water Pik and actually make one that is not junk.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Causes my gums to bleed whenever I use it!!  And regular $.97 dental floss works better than this electric flosser.</li>
    <li> I tried this for about 3 weeks and wanted it to work since I am not a big flosser and wasn&#x27;t flossing consistently.  I kept this in the shower and would fill it with mouthwash.  It was interesting but didn&#x27;t get down in between my teeth the way that real flossing does.  I guess it&#x27;s better than nothing but I returned it and am sticking with the ribbon floss that works better and runs about 1/100th of the cost.</li>
    <li> unfortunalty this unit was going to travel with us to replace our waterpik.. to even close. good thought poor execution.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband and he could not be any happier.  It is easy to use and prefers it over the water piks.</li>
    <li> I hope that it continues to do a good job as it has been. I never floss so this item should be a lifesaver for me. I enjoy it. You really can&#x27;t go too wrong with the Phillips product.</li>
    <li> It was as my Dentist had said, gets between the teeth better than regular floss.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful - Will make gums bleed if sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Messy - blows water and air forcefully&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it obviously does not beat actual flossing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend for home use and daily use (I can&#x27;t seem to floss daily) but make sure to actually floss every once in awhile the old school way.</li>
    <li> Liked product until a year latter --won&#x27;t work or take a charge--I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. One star or less. I don&#x27;t believe I am the only one this happened too.</li>
    <li> This is a great device and I believe most of the complaints are actually related to user error. If you are having a problem with water dripping down the flosser and/or your arm --&gt; close your mouth. If you are running out of liquid --&gt; use patience. If you take the time to make sure it is properly placed between your teeth before you push the trigger, you will have enough liquid in the reservoir to floss from both the outside and inside of all your teeth--with liquid left over. There is a learning curve and you will have to learn where to place the device and how to angle it so that it cleans but isn&#x27;t blasting straight up into your gums, but that only took me a few days and now I&#x27;m a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to turn if off before you wipe it off or put it away, or you might run the risk of accidentally setting it off and spraying your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It blows gunk out from between my teeth and I can smell the bacteria, just like when I floss traditionally, so I know it&#x27;s working. I prefer to fill it with mouthwash so I don&#x27;t have to taste/smell it so much. I would still recommend probably flossing traditionally once or twice a week just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always HATED flossing but this makes it seem like so much less of a chore and I&#x27;ve been using the AirFloss every day. Even if it doesn&#x27;t work as well as floss, I think using this every day at least once a day is better than me only flossing traditionally once every other day or two like I was.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Sonicare toothbrushes so I thought I would give the new Airfloss a try when the battery died on my cordless Waterpik. Unfortunately, there is no comparison between the two products. The Airfloss uses a thimble full of water plus air in short bursts to remove plaque and food, and overall my mouth just didn&#x27;t feel clean. I returned the Airfloss and got a [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra]] which is half the price and a far more effective way of cleaning your teeth. Using a Waterpik is less convenient and a bit messy (because of the amount of water it uses), but it does a far better job than the Airfloss. Also, I&#x27;m tired of cordless products with built-in obsolescence when the battery dies, and the Waterpik Ultra plugs into the wall which is ideal.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  Happily, I bought the Airfloss as soon as I got the offer from Amazon.  It is a pleasure to use it and it does the job.  I flossed after using it and didn&#x27;t find anything, anymore.  I cannot wait to have my next cleaning.  Before Philips Sonicare toothbrush, there was work to be done at each cleaning.  Less and less as the flexible toothbrush does a wonderful job.  I can tell this is another excellent product from Philips and I am grateful to them.  Life if easier w/o using the classic floss and flossing is a pleasure with Airfloss.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that when I use it, water is running down your chin; also my dental hygienist recommended it for a couple of troublesome areas in my mouth.  When I use this on this two spots, I not only have water running down my chin, but blood as well.  It&#x27;s too rough on the sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Reservoir to small must refill alot. Didn&#x27;t live up to Hype. Would not purchase if knew all the facts that simple.</li>
    <li> simple, effective and sane - no more cutting off the circulation of my fingers with floss wrapping - I like the massage to the gum line and being able to shoot a good mouthwash through the unit is a big plus. Worth the money to add to a regime.</li>
    <li> this product seemed like a good idea.  the &amp;#34;door&amp;#34; would not stay shut and the instructions state to keep the charger dry to prevent shock.  well one has to put liquid inside the thing and who is going to wipe it dry all the time?</li>
    <li> it shoots a pulse of air every 3 seconds or so after charging for 24 hours (mine took about 4)&lt;br /&gt;my teeth are close together so I don&#x27;t feel as though its pushing plaque away, but I do know its easier than flossing, which I didnt do so this has to be an improvement :-).&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use, set up and did I say use  makes flossing fun</li>
    <li> found this product to be completely ineffective....small bursts of water just dont do the trick...water pik plus much more effective.  i returned item.</li>
    <li> I use this every day twice a day. It&#x27;s easy to incorporate into your daily regiment. Even with the best intentions I would usually stop traditional flossing a week or so after my dentist visit (then floss like crazy for a week before my next appointment).&lt;br /&gt;While this may not be as effective as traditional flossing, it&#x27;s 100% better than not flossing at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It makes a mundane task way more fun.  I like the fact that I can &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; without having to stick my fingers in my mouth.  It gets the little bits of food from between my teeth with a puff of air.  Works great on popcorn husks.</li>
    <li> Like the product a lot!  Very powerful air/water flosser.  First time users, anticipate getting use to the power between your teeth.  Only concern is when I do have to change replacement nozzle, the current one is really on tight.</li>
    <li> This device may be useful for someone who doesn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t floss at all, but if you floss, this is not a replacement in any way, and it is not an enhancement like oral irrigating with warm water, etc.  I&#x27;m taking it back in the 28 day period for my $$ back.  I found it icky.</li>
    <li> Air Burst of fresh water between teeth is great, mouth feels cleaner. It is almost like a water pik, but the flow of water is not constant, you depress the button when you are ready for the soft burst of water to flow exactly where you floss.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and I have to say I&#x27;m very disappointed. It sounds like a great, fresh idea in theory that you don&#x27;t have to fiddle with string floss. However, in practice this product is of little use. I tried it for the first time and I hadn&#x27;t flossed in a few days, so I was expecting it to be easy to tell whether or not it actually had an effect. I used it first as advertised -- only one \\&quot;shoot\\&quot; per tooth -- and didn&#x27;t really feel like it did anything. So I went through all teeth again and had to refill the water reserve when doing this. Again, I couldn&#x27;t even see a trace of plaque coming out from between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, I tried with my regular string floss, and this is when I realized how worthless the Philips AirFloss is: the regular floss got *a lot* of nasty stuff out between my teeth, which I would expect after not having flossed for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this product sounded too good to be true, and it turns out it was. I give it two stars rather than just one because I did get some mild gum bleed when first using it, which I take as a sign that it&#x27;s at least massaging the gums more than just brushing your teeth would. In other words, it&#x27;s better than nothing, but regular floss is way better than this expensive product. If you never floss, this product is certainly a step up for you, but honestly, do yourself a favor and buy some floss picks. You&#x27;ll be surprised how much your toothbrush (and Philips AirFloss) misses!</li>
    <li> Great product, works well. Unfortunately, after a couple of months I noticed mold growing inside water chamber. Have not been able to find out how to clean / remove mold, so this became a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is the bast ever flosser, easy to use, the charge last longer that expected...I can see the difference myself.  No more gunk between the teeth when reitiring for the night.</li>
    <li> compare with water floss HX8111 is more portable. So it can be put into a bag. But fill water fully, it only use 20 times, then you should fill water again.</li>
    <li> it is very very good...the best thing I bought because I don&#x27;t need to use the dental floss anymore...&lt;br /&gt;excellent...</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom for Christmas after she mentioned missing her cordless Waterpik.  This looked pretty cool but she did not find it convenient to have to push the button every time you wanted it to pulse.  She returned it and we each now own a Toilettree irrigator, which we both love.  It&#x27;s very much like the cordless Waterpik.  I also own a Sonicare toothbrush, but its base cannot be used with this.</li>
    <li> This had been recommended to me by my hygienist.  Ordered it, liked it until about the 5th fime I used it and it ceased to work!  Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> Torture device for tight contacts and sensitive gums! Returning IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased this item because I am not a fan of flossing. I don&#x27;t floss regularly, but when I do, my teeth don&#x27;t bleed. I&#x27;m in my thirties, and I don&#x27;t have problem teeth, however I have very tight contacts. So, I figured this would be great for me- doesn&#x27;t take much time, can get to the back of the mouth easily, etc. I read all of the instructions first, and I watched you tube videos to supplement the instructions to make sure I was doing it right.&lt;br /&gt;  The blasts coming from the airfloss are extremely powerful! I was shocked and a little put off when I tested it on my hand- because it actually stung. I placed it in between my two front teeth, and OWWW! I bled profusely, I rinsed and rinsed and it took minutes for the bleeding to stop. Not only was it bloody, but it was painful; hours later it still hurts. I read the reviews again- looking to see if I was the only one. I went at it again, this time *not* putting it where it clearly states on the instructions to put it- on the gum line between the teeth. Instead, I moved it down a bit away from the gum line, but still between my teeth, and it was still strong enough to make all but a few of my teeth bleed.&lt;br /&gt;  Let me say that regular flossing neither hurts me nor makes me bleed in any way. The Airfloss seems TOO POWERFUL, and seems like it may cause damage to your gums. This device will single handedly turn me into a daily flosser, and I am packing it up and returning it immediately. Obviously, I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend this product to anyone. The reviews also seem to be inconsistent- some say it&#x27;s too powerful, some say it&#x27;s not; which leads me to believe that it is an inconsistent product. Those who purchased the ones that weren&#x27;t powerful are lucky. I am in pain.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this AirFloss because I love my Sonicare toothbrush, which has given years of good service.  What a disappointment this new product is!  First of all it does not floss your teeth.  Floss goes between your teeth vertically from gum line to tip, and floss also cleans out the gum line along the horizontal length of the tooth.  This product sends a millisecond long jet of air and water only at the top of the tooth near the gum, where the gap is in most people&#x27;s teeth.  It does not clean along the entire space that separates adjacent teeth, and it does not clean along the body of the tooth along the gum line.  The instructions say only to use it on the buccal surface of teeth (the cheek side), not on the inside (tongue side).  Therefore, this product only cleans one specific spot: the outer facing tooth surface between teeth, and only just at the top where there is a little gap between the teeth.  It gets about 1/10 of the surface reached by string flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, even when used as directed, the AirFloss squirts water all over the bathroom.  Feel like washing the bathroom mirror?  Just use this product and your mirror will be covered with water droplets mixed with spit.  Disgusting.  Not to mention the fact that if the jet hits your tongue (which it invariably does a couple times during each use), it stings like a bee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this product as directed then floss your teeth afterwards. You will find that the floss comes out just as covered with schmutz as it would had you not \\&quot;flossed\\&quot; with an AirFloss.  This product simply does not work, causes tongue pain, and then you have to clean the bathroom sink and mirror when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning mine today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I did not buy this at Amazon.  But the product was so stunningly bad that I logged in to my Amazon account just to warn prospective buyers.  If you know of a flossing product that effectively replaces or surpasses the old fashioned string kind, please leave a comment on this post.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of flossed teeth and know it&#x27;s very beneficial for many reasons but I could never remember to do it or hated my sore fingers afterward.  This was recommended by my dental hygenist because it does the job well and is easy to use.  After a month I have to agree.  My teeth feel well flossed after using it, I remember to do it much more often, it&#x27;s so quick and easy to use and I don&#x27;t have those sore fingers any longer.  One of the best health purchases I&#x27;ve every made.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and loved it.  It would be better if it had a little larger water tank.  The problem started about 6 weeks after I bought it and it started having charging issues.  A week later it would not charge at all.  I have read other reports of this issue.  For the price it should not have died so quickly.  Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I got this Airflosser in December and by mid January it was not working  I missed the deadline to return by a few days so now I&#x27;m stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I hate fossing and of course my gums are in really bad condition.  I got this after my last visit to the dentist.  When I returned in three months my hygenist immediately noticed the differance.  Be carefull and read the instructions....only use on the outside of your gums not the inside.  Expect some bleeding at first.  I either use Scope or water in it. It holds about a thumble of liquid.  It gives a puff of air and liquid that cleans between your teeth.  I use to get allot of plaque buildup on my front lower teeth and it has keep it from comming back too.  I use it once a day and then brush with my Sonicareafter.  Well worth the cost if you hate flossing like me.</li>
    <li> I love this electric flosser. It does not replace flossing all together but it cleans out all of the extra stuff that floss leaves behind. My mouth feels so much fresher and my dentist said my mouth has stayed much cleaner since my last cleaning. I am very pleased with this purchase. I highly recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I find this unit removes particles from between my teeth and under the gums very well. It takes a few times of use to get used to it. My dentist suggested to continue flossing normally and using this unit for deeper cleaning, which works out well for me. I use the Air Floss in mornings and conventional floss and the Air Floss at night. I will be curious to see what my dentist says at my next cleaning.</li>
    <li> This tool is effective at flossing but difficult to maneuver and little direction provided. Perhaps just takes more time and trial.</li>
    <li> VERY misleading advertising! NO APPLIANCE will remove plaque - ONLY manual flossing will do that. Their advertising says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Air and microdroplet technology removes up to 99% more plaque between teeth* in 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;* than a manual toothbrush alone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, remember your math and do the following ~ a manual toothbrush removes(0)ZERO plaque so 99x0&#x3D;????  RIGHT - ZERO! The velocity of water needed to remove plaque would destroy the gum tissue, so there is NOTHING that really flosses the teeth but floss! Sorry, but it&#x27;s the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will remove food and may make your gums feel good, but don&#x27;t think you are removing plaque, because it is not possible. Ask your hygienist or dentist if you don&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> Had tis item for about 5 months and it no longer works. When you turn it on it just makes a clicking noise. I am disappointed. I read som other review that had the same problem. I guess I should have paid attention to that rewiew</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth, and a lot of difficulty reaching the back teeth in my mouth. This reaches back there easily, and will help me keep my teeth and gums healthier.</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended this product to me due to my predisposition toward gum disease. It has been very effective so far at stopping the progression of the disease. I brush, floss and rinse every day, but this gets to places the floss does not. If you have or are developing gum disease, definitely ask your hygienist about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not very well engineered. It achieves its primary purpose, but the reservoir needs to be replenished almost every use, and is very awkward to fill. When using it, excess liquid runs from the nozzle down the handle and all over your hand. Liquid can also collect in the space between the pad you push to activate the device and the contact. This results in a sticky button. In a lot of ways, this feels like a beta version of the product in terms of finish.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo10YB1WPJSTJYY]]When it worked, it worked well.  I found that the trick is not to hold the head up against your teeth.  Instead pull it away a mm or 2.  This seemed to increase the overall power of the stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews claimed the stream was too strong and wished it had an adjustment.  I did not find that to be the case at all.  I almost always used it with mouthwash, since unlike the waterpik, it uses such a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks it started making a grinding noise when the trigger was pressed.  It sounded like a gear was stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I liked the product, I returned it rather than have it replaced because I had no faith that a new one would be any better.  Perhaps I will try again when version 2 releases.</li>
    <li> Although the packaging stated it was an HX8111/30 the model number on the bottom of the unit is HX8140, an outdated model.  And to top it off there was no nozzle in the package making it unusable.  Looks like I should have purchased the retail package rather than Amazon&#x27;s Frustration Free.</li>
    <li> Having a Sonicare toothbrush I had high hopes for this.  I was sorely disappointed.  This thing does a terrible job, is incredibly messy and is poorly manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I used it for the first time is that it uses a mechanical, spring-loaded mechanism to load up and charge a spray.  The problem is that this mechanism pops and clicks so often that doesn&#x27;t get a fully-charged spray.  The issue continues in that even if the device doesn&#x27;t pop/click it still sometimes doesn&#x27;t fully load a spray - even with a full liquid well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing is it&#x27;s unbelievably messy.  The cover for the well is poorly designed and leaks horribly.  I have to keep my thumb on it to keep the liquid at bay.  I tried filling it only halfway thinking I may have overfilled it, but it still had the issue.  When using the device, if you don&#x27;t have it angled just perfectly, spray will go everywhere but in your mouth.  You have to try to keep you mouth closed as best as you can, which is irritating to do with this device.  At the very least you&#x27;re either drooling all over the place or spitting after every 3rd spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to the angle, again if you don&#x27;t have it positioned just perfectly the spray can also stop at your teeth and do absolutely nothing.  You essentially just wasted a shot of spray from a well that you have to fill after nearly every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you do happen to have it positioned perfectly, it does an okay job - but only for teeth that it can get between.  If your teeth are close enough together that the only thing you can get between them is floss, then don&#x27;t waste your money on the Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning mine today and going back to good ol&#x27; floss.</li>
    <li> I have returned the item because it began to make grinding noises when in use, from time to time.  I chose a refund rather than replacement because (1) it was messy to use, and (2) I was not sure if it was effective in removing food debris between my teeth.  I had planned to continue using it until it was clear to me that the desired effect was achieved, but the grinding noise and uncertainty as to how I would measure effectiveness changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Sonicare toothbrush from Philips.  I am very pleased with how well that item has kept me from having anything other than teeth cleaning visits to my dentist.  I wondered if the Airflosser would be more effective than string flossing.  Unproven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint was that the unit caused spraying outside my mouth.  When I got smart enough to use it with my mount closed, i found that then there was a good deal of dribbling instead.  I was also not sure how well I was doing placing the tip in the correct spot at or near the gumline.  With my mount closed I could not monitor well, and I tended to forget to close at the right moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triggering the pulse was also somewhat difficult. I seemed to need to shift my finger on the trigger with each new pulse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where there was a considerable gap between the teeth at the gumline, I thought the Airflosser was probably effective.  But a number of my teeth are close set, and there I had a sense that little was being achieved in the way of cleansing.  I can force the floss into the gap between the teeth, so I will go back to regular flossing.</li>
    <li> Not only unpleasant and clumsy to use but in fact it really doesn&#x27;t do much of anything. Don&#x27;t bother! A Waste of money and space.</li>
    <li> Works very good. Gets my teeth and the spaces between very clean. I don&#x27;t like the stand as it  fits rather sloppy.</li>
    <li> I use this tool twice a day.  It&#x27;s easy, convenient and fun.  The trick is to hold it slightly away from your teeth when you pull the trigger.  You get high velocity hydro-blasting this way.  I used to have tartar build up on my lower front teeth even with occasional flossing.  It seems to be all gone now.  When I first used this tool, I had some sensitivity on teeth that apparently had some gum inflammation.  After a few uses, it went away, indicating improved tooth health.  Although the water reservoir is small, I just run water into it from faucet without regard to how wet the unit gets.  It&#x27;s apparently water proof.  Good battery life also.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly big gap between a crown and a molar that had been filling with food and causing me problems. I decided to get really fanatical about cleaning and get a squeeze bottle to flush it out. One thing led to another and I ended up with this device. What wasn&#x27;t clear from the other reviews was how it works - you fill up the little reservoir with liquid (water or mouth wash) and press the button. It then fires a puff of the two through the nozzle that is hopefully positioned between your teeth. Then one of a two things happen - if you have it well positioned (not too difficult) and you have a gap between your teeth it will blow out most of the muck in there and sometimes hit your tongue with a smack too. it&#x27;s quite a shock the first few times you use it! Alternatively, if you have no gap, or it&#x27;s otherwise blocked, it&#x27;ll build up pressure until you move the nozzle and then fizzle out slower. Most of my teeth have some gap, but a few near the front don&#x27;t so this air flossing doesn&#x27;t really work on those.&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, you can use mouthwash and I&#x27;ve found this to be the best. It can also make cheap generic mouthwash taste better because it&#x27;s kind of diluted with air! (I bought a huge bottle of cheap stuff from Safeway and maybe in a year or 2 I&#x27;ll be through it!)&lt;br /&gt;Do you still need real floss? Yeah, maybe. It depends on how keen you are (and some folks clearly are fanatical). For me it&#x27;s very quick, probably gets 99% of the bad stuff out and works really well. I wouldn&#x27;t take it with me on a trip, but it takes up very little space next to the sink at home sitting on the little charger place.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have braces. I have regular on bottom and incognito on top. I don&#x27;t really understand this product. Maybe its because my teeth are so close together and have virtually no gaps in between them, but when I use the airfloss if I put it right up against my gumline and the little space I do have between my teeth the water just shoots back out on my face or bathroom mirror. Then if I just barely put it next to my teeth it doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with flossing. This might be better for people who don&#x27;t have crowded teeth.</li>
    <li> You can not set it up right except on the charging stand.  The tool has quite a punch when it fires the jet.  Care should be taken when aiming blast, it should aimed between the teeth.  It is more powerful than a water-pic.  The force of the blast is non-adjustable.</li>
    <li> I bought the AirFloss thinking it would help in my dental hygiene. While the AirFloss does a decent job of limiting the amount of plaque, I found it&#x27;s not as good as the WaterPik Cordless Plus Water Flosser WP-450. Moreover, the WaterPik is inexpensive ; as much as $35 dollars expensive.</li>
    <li> The bottom line for me is that this product has made a vast improvement in my oral health, and even my overall health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is probably true that this device is not a direct and sole replacement for manual flossing. But, conversely, flossing is not a direct and sole replacement for the use of this device. So, they are probably complementary. At least that is the case for me. It is also true that this device is uniquely useful, different than any other water-based device I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes quite a bit of use and practice to learn how to best use the Airfloss and maximize its effectiveness. It was not love at first use for me. I&#x27;ve found it is most useful with your mouth fully open and making a complete mess every time. Also, I need to do all sides of the teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad news is that the Airfloss is not durable. Water gets into the electronics and fouls it up but good. I&#x27;ve lost three units to water fouling the electronics. My newest unit is lasting, but probably only because I took it apart when it was brand new and coated the circuit board with electronics epoxy. I also put epoxy at the inside of the handle seam, and the inside of the power switch seam. I&#x27;ll see if this holds up. But in any case I hope the product continues to be available and they improve it in a new generation.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I am pregnant and my gums are very sensitive and inflamed. Flossing is painful and I thought this would be better. MY dentist actually recommended as an alternative or addition to flossing. I like that I can put irrigation solution in capsule. The negatives are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You have to manually push the button for every pulse between every tooth.&lt;br /&gt;2) The pulse is like a hammer against gums. IF the plastic is touching gums when you pull trigger, the tip literally feels like it backfires against your gums. Maybe no big deal for normal gums, but this hurts inflamed gums and actually caused more bleeding and irritation than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;3) You still need to floss to get food out from between teeth. Bummer:(</li>
    <li> About half my teeth are spaced very close together. Ironically my dentist told me my flossing was working between tight fitting teeth but not others. This product is perfect for between those teeth that have a little more space between them. The &amp;#34;shot of water&amp;#34; does not propel between tightly fit or overlapping teeth. I still floss but have found this to be a great supplement to flossing. And you don&#x27;t have to be in the shower to use it (unlike water pik products).</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth and a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth, which means flossing is pretty much impossible for me. I did a ton of research on water flossers, and I chose this one over the Waterpik for a few reasons. I liked the idea of a small squirt of water for each tooth, rather than the \\&quot;squirt gun\\&quot; mechanism of the Waterpik. I live in a dorm, so space is a huge consideration, and most of the Waterpiks are bulky countertop units with cords. Even in my own bathroom at home, I can&#x27;t see myself liking something like that. And while Waterpik does have a cordless, portable unit, it was much less aesthetically pleasing than this one. Overall, I think it was a good choice. I like the small squirt of liquid, since it feels like I have more control, and this is great at getting particles out of my permanent retainer and fitting easily into the back of my mouth. It isn&#x27;t a perfect product, however, and I have noted the following concerns that I have after using it for a couple days:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The tip is plastic, and I don&#x27;t particularly like the feel of it on my teeth. A rubber tip, or even a rubber ring around the very tip that touches your teeth, would vastly improve the overall experience for me. Also, a cover for the tip would help me feel a little better about germs and such.&lt;br /&gt;2) Speaking of a cover, where is the travel case? That seems like it should be a standard feature for a daily use appliance like this. Most of the Sonicare toothbrushes come with one; this should as well.&lt;br /&gt;3) The sound that this makes is rather ominous. First it revvs up with a sound much like cheap printer loading paper, then it squirts out water with a puff like a pitching machine accompanied by a spring. Frankly, the noise is a little cheap sounding, and could potentially be annoying to other people, especially since it isn&#x27;t a constant noise.&lt;br /&gt;4) The handle seems especially large considering the small amount of water the product holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had problemsrunning out of water while using this yet, but I don&#x27;t think it would be that big of a deal if I did since it literally takes half a second to fill. I have noticed that if I press the tip too close to my teeth, the water gets stuck rather than pushing through the gap between my teeth. Not really a big deal, but something to be careful of when using it. As others have noted, use warm or room temperature water as it is much more comfortable that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product just fine, and I will definitely use it in place of flossing. However, I am not completely sold on this yet, and I would consider buying a different product as a replacement if this ever broke.</li>
    <li> Due to an accident I have several bridges.  They usually require the use of floss threaders to pull dental floss through the bridge.  With the Sonicare Flosser, I can easily clean my bridges without the annonance of the threaders.  It works well on healthy teeth, of course, and is quick and easy to use.  I might add that it holds a charge for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. it is a perfect replacement for the floss. Great results !!! I recommend it for those you doesn&#x27;t use the floss.</li>
    <li> I use it every day....my teeth are very tight together and it&#x27;s difficult to get floss between. This thing is awesome and really gets a lot of junk out after brushing with my sonicare . My gums feel awesome after 2 weeks. Expect a little bleeding as you get used to it but this disappeared after a few days. I think it&#x27;s because my gums are healthier.</li>
    <li> If you do not like flossing with dental floss, the Philips Sonicare is the way to go!  You can even use mouthwash or rinse in it.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use, great on the gums, no mess. Very massaging to the gums!! Just what the dentist ordered for cleaning without floss.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think you can use this and give up your day job of flossing.  This product definitely does not &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34;.....Messy use - spews water/mouth wash - feels more like a facial than a flossing.  Takes multiple refills for one use.</li>
    <li> When you initially use this, the spurts are weak but 2 or 3 pushes of the button and it becomes quite forceful.  If you use this on the inside of your teeth, you can actually see the puffing of your cheeks from the power of the &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34;.  After brushing your teeth, you&#x27;d be surprised about how much food residue is left between your teeth, this forces all of that away.  Best of all, it&#x27;s quick and there&#x27;s no excuse for not flossing any more.  I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> It has stopped working. Does not get charged. Just bought it 2 months back. This has happened for the second time in last 6 months.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  This is the best product for cleaning between the teeth since I really hate flossing with the string type floss.  It works and I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> What a waste, it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything except take up counter space.Maria Menoonouse on television must be getting paid by Sonicare for having said this is a great product.  WASTE</li>
    <li> It works basically as described, except it is hard to get the flosser into back gum areas and behind the teeth in the gums (based on its rigid shape).  But the jets of water are strong and forceful. I&#x27;ll continue using it for more than a few weeks to make sure it&#x27;s working.  And of course the results of the efforts will be known the next time I visit my dentist.</li>
    <li> Flossing is still necessary periodically.  This is better than not flossing but a bit sloppy.  Takes a little less time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this.  I was so tired of getting food stuck in my teeth.  This works really great.  No more food, no more bad breath.</li>
    <li> I got GREAT DEAL at Costco. It was a value package comes with two flossers, two extra nozzles, two cases and one charger and was only $99.99 with instant rebate!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, let&#x27;s talk about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I feel super clean after I use this flosser and I am loving it!! Also this flosser doesn&#x27;t make my  gum bleeding, I hate my gum breed when I use normal dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very simple design, easy to use and clean!&lt;br /&gt;This was a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one complaint is though, you have to close your mouth not to splash water and it&#x27;s not very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I am very happy with this product. If you want to keep your teeth super clean and tired of seeing blood when you use dental floss, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Superb.product. Arrived on time. Thank. You. Amazon.a. Big. Fan of this product totally. Changed my. Oral hygiene a. Perfect gift for myself as a replacement</li>
    <li> I use a Philips Sonicare toothbrush so I was expecting good things from the Airfloss. The way it works is by shooting pulses of liquid through the teeth. The reservoir is not very big and I have found that it requires filling about halfway through the cleaning process. It&#x27;s somewhat difficult to maneuver it properly in the mouth. I have grown accustomed to using a continuous-flow water flossor so I purchased this product for travel. Because it doesn&#x27;t work near as well as a continuous-flow type of unit, I only give it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted one of these devices, thinking it would be a substitute for her aqua-pik-like flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.  It&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it maybe 10 times, her even fewer, and I can&#x27;t see how it does me any good after using GUM soft-picks and brushing with the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Have had quite a bit of dental work done and want needed to take better care of my teeth and gums.  Was flossing regularly but dentist said gums were still not great and recommended buying a water pik.  My small apt bathroom counter is small enough, and i saw this. Takes a couple of times getting used to it but after no time i can properly use it with almost no thought at all.  Doesn&#x27;t take the place of flossing but works well, and i can see and feel a difference in my gums. Glad i gave it a try. Girlfriend now wants one.</li>
    <li> I bought an Airfloss on the recommendation of my dentist who thought it would help both with cleaning between my teeth and promoting gum health. I used it as directed twice a day for 6 months and usually filled it with Listerine. First off, I found the button hyper sensitive. I was constantly spraying myself in the face or spraying the mirror by accident. Second, it was hard to keep the device clean and dry due to spillage and leakage when refilling or in use. Third, it was really hard to tell if it was even doing anything. However, at my next dental checkup, my dentist said everything was looking great so I figured the Airfloss had made a difference. Unfortunately, I had also started doing a couple other things so I couldn&#x27;t be sure. As it turned out, my Airfloss died just a few days after that checkup. It would charge but the button wouldn&#x27;t depress at all. I tried cleaning it with no success. Fast forward 6 months and I just had another dental checkup. Same great report! Apparently the Airfloss didn&#x27;t make any difference! Maybe the Airfloss might help someone with bad dental health, but for someone like me with clean, healthy teeth and gums it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any value.</li>
    <li> And imagination, not imaginary, his teeth with the things cannot be completely clean&lt;br /&gt;Air is strong, easy to cause the bleeding gums</li>
    <li> Using this product has been great. After flossing my mouth feels refreshed. I use mouthwash instead of water, the pulse of air and mouthwash does an effective job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used a [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] for some time now. It&#x27;s bulky, messy, inconvenient, tethered to the wall, it uses a ton of water, it&#x27;s difficult to get the hang of, but it gets my teeth very, very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is quite the opposite: it&#x27;s easy to use, compact, barely uses any water (it also doesn&#x27;t spray it all over you and your sink), and it&#x27;s quite small and mobile. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s also poorly made, and really does not get my teeth clean. While my Waterpik gets all kinds of additional crud out from between my teeth, the Airfloss does little or nothing to clean my teeth more than brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that I (1) hate flossing and (2) love my Sonicare toothbrush with religious ferver, I was really excited to see this product hit the market. Unfortunately, I have been sorely disappointed with it over the past week, and I&#x27;m sending it back and going back to my big, messy Waterpik. I look forward to the 2nd generation Airfloss from Sonicare, because the 1st gen is pretty terrible.</li>
    <li> Sonicare??? Made this crap??? Why??? It does absolutely nothing except hits the teeth with force and blows some water/air mix. Who allowed this crap on the market? Who designed this POS?</li>
    <li> I love the innovations from Sonicare and this product works well. My only change would be for the reservoir to hold additional water.</li>
    <li> Worked great up until today. I had it a year and it died.&lt;br /&gt;But! The good news is Phillips is replacing it. Took ten minutes on the phone and the replacement will be sent out&lt;br /&gt;in 8-10 days.&lt;br /&gt;So, great item and the company stands by it.</li>
    <li> The idea behind is great but the workmanship is far immature. Within two months, I&#x27;ve bought and returned 3 of them. The first one went fine for a week and then suddenly refused to power on. The second one was working fine for about a month and stopped power on even if the green light is lit. The third one after one week stopped responding on the button when I pressed it. Three bad ones in a row within such a short period. That&#x27;s not a lemon. There&#x27;s some serious flaw with this model. I&#x27;ve lost interest and confidence in getting a new one although I can fairly painlessly do so. Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment after 8 months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have tried a few more from the same store. they all shockingly consistently failed within one month. So far, I&#x27;ve bought and returned almost 7 or 8 of them - none of them passed one month. I&#x27;ve found the store seems no longer carrying this item. for those over 300 reviewers who gave at least 3 stars, I seriously suspect if they have taken vendor&#x27;s incentives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THERE IS NO WAY TO GIVE A PASSING SCORE TO A PRODUCT THAT 100% FAILS!!</li>
    <li> It certainly has gotten out bits I missed while brushing and even flossing. Was shocked.  You need to give it a chance for you to become accustom to it, like to tooth brush made by them.</li>
    <li> This product offer greater efficiency over manual flossing. I pour Crest Pro mouthwash in to the chamber for maximum effect over water.</li>
    <li> Not sure I get the hype on this product. Prefer my waterpix over this for what it is supposed to do. I don&#x27;t feel anything it blows out in the sink. My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel fresh or cleaner after using it.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t as messy as a waterpix - so maybe for travel it could fulfill the need to do more than just brush.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is too small - have to fill it twice to do my whole mouth sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;It is just Okay.</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago and after 3 months of use the fill cap broke off just opening it. Its&#x27; kind of delicate.  Called manufacturer and they replaced it (nice) but after 2 months of use it stopped working altogether. No water, nothing.  I&#x27;m over it I guess.  I though the product only worked marginally anyway and if its going to be a constant source of irritation vs. a modern convenience that works I&#x27;m out.  File 13.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking I could use this instead of flossing.  I have a permanent retainer which makes flossing difficult.  After receiving it and trying it out I am actually pretty angry at Phillips for marketing such a poor product.  I also feel it is a classic case of dishonest advertising. The product is poor designed, it air pushed out is not very strong I don&#x27;t see how it is doing anything for my gums at all.  It seems like a scam product.  I would return it but Amazon won&#x27;t credit me the money because they didn&#x27;t fulfill it.  Its not worth the 75 dollar hassle.  The least I can do is keep other from making the same mistake.  I am huge fan of Sonic care line but this is sad and I think tarnishes Phillips brand.  Did they really need the extra bucks with this sham of a product?  Very poor.  I will even think twice next time I buy a new sonic care which I have purchased at least 5 in the last 10 years - simply on how poor this air floss device is.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother. So far she absolutely loves it because it&#x27;s effective and makes flossing so much easier.</li>
    <li> my son loves it. i guess this system doesn like short comments. so i will keep typing regardless of the stupid system.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;air&amp;#34; flosser.  i thought it would be less messy than a true &amp;#34;waterpik&amp;#34; but it isn&#x27;t.  the water ends us all over the mirror.  the reservoir for the water is too small to complete the job.  would NOT recommend.  have gone back to my waterpik.</li>
    <li> I have a Sonicare toothbrush and love it. I&#x27;ve also had Waterpiks from when I had braces and they were ok albeit messy. I saw this while I was out (did not buy it through Amazon) and thought I had to have it just because the toothbrush is so incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are things I like about the Airfloss and there are reasons I seriously thought about returning it. I ended up keeping it. As the description says, it shoots out short bursts of air and whatever you use in the reservoir. I use mouthwash. You have to line it up correctly for it to get between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very portable, it keeps a charge for quite a while, and it&#x27;s really great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing. There are days where I&#x27;ll use it quickly in the middle of the day because it makes my mouth feel good.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s not messy.&lt;br /&gt;It uses the same base as the toothbrush so if you have that, you can only use one base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I floss too and the Sonicare doesn&#x27;t get everything.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is small and is awkward to fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that item that you have to have because it makes your mouth extra special clean. I think it can help and it&#x27;s refreshing but instead of simplifying your routine, it&#x27;s adding another step because it doesn&#x27;t take the place of brushing or flossing unless you&#x27;re just touching up during the day.</li>
    <li> Interesting, there are almost as many 1 Star Ratings for this Product as 5 Star.  I wonder why?  Its pretty simple, if you are someone who Flosses on a regular basis and has no problem fitting your fingers into the rear of your mouth attempting to push a piece of string between your teeth, continue to do so.  It will do a superior job, period!  If someone, like myself, does (not) conscientiously Floss regularly and don&#x60;t want to use the Reach Easy Access Floss Heads attached to a Toothbrush type handle, the SoniCare Airfloss will be great.  I personally use a SoniCare Electric vibrating Toothbrush that does an excellent job of tooth cleaning.  However, after brush I use the AirFloss and within just 60 seconds, an amazing amount of debris is removed with this flossing device.  Compared to the WaterPic  which requires a attached tube and water reservoir to the hand held unit, I prefer the easy to hold and use SoniCare Airfloss.  In summation, if your a religious Flosser, continue to do so the old fashion way.  If not, you will love this Product!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after just a few months.</li>
    <li> Was very excited about this product and thought it will replace my other use and throw floss.&lt;br /&gt;But after using it for some time now it just sits in the restroom. I prefer use and throw more convenient way rather than spending on this product. Little complicated way to do floss.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job.  I have an implant and the flosser really does a good job cleaning around it.  I fill the flosser with mouthwash.  Much easier to use than a water pic devise.</li>
    <li> I like the flosser for the job it does.  I have found that I can not use it at the sink because it splatters on the mirror above.</li>
    <li> Just too strong a stream and always have to be refilled.  Hurt gums and didn&#x27;t like it.  My husband is using it .  Mrs  Nancy Cobin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a reluctant flosser and the best I could manage was a grudging 3-4 times a week. Since my wife (a dentist) bought me this I now floss morning and night and actually look forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is messy, but if you learn to hold your mouth right it&#x27;s not that bad. In any case it&#x27;s better than wiping the hunks of crud that come flying out on to your vanity mirror when you floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I was a bit startled by the force with which it delivers a single blast of water and air when you pull the trigger. Once I got used to it I couldn&#x27;t beleive the junk it was blowing out of the deepest recesses of my gums!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on my wife&#x27;s recommendation I use it after brushing and put Crest Pro Health with Flouride mouthwash in it instead of water. That way I&#x27;m getting the mouthwash down in my gums and between my teeth where the bacteria hide. Plus I can save time be essentially flossing and gargling simultaneously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It probably isn&#x27;t a complete replacement for flossing, I still do a manual floss occasionally just to get some physical contact between my teeth. But I notice when I do that my teeth feel smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only fault I can find is that it would be nice if the reservoir was slightly bigger so you dont have to fill it every time. But that&#x27;s a minor annoyance compared to the tremendous benefit provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums have nevet been healthier, and I cant beleive I actually enjoy flossing!  Buy it!!</li>
    <li> This is great for getting something out from between your teeth, but is not a waterpick!!! It shoots short,short blasts of water and air one press of the button at a time. One press , one blast no more. I thought it would be continuious last until you unpress the button. Workes OK. Still need to brush and maybe floss before or after.</li>
    <li> I love this product. II thought it wouldn&#x27;t do as good a job as floss, but at my last dental visit, she remarked on the fact that I seemed to be doing a much better job with flossing. It seems to blast all the little pieces of debris out. I put mouthwash in the reservoir instead of water and I have good breath now!</li>
    <li> After one trail it just lies in the drug cabinets, very low efficient, but because this is a health related product, to be a gentleman, I did not return it as long as it has been trailed in my mouth,  but if I can I would like to return it. How disappointing it is....</li>
    <li> It is much too strong an air pulse on the gums for me.&lt;br /&gt;It might be great for others, but I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was for our teenage grandson tha just had orthodontic braces put in and he says this works great to get everything clean</li>
    <li> the airflosser is just great!!! this was the best investment I could have ever made, thanks to my dentist&#x27;s recommendation!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an air flosser before, my gum bleeds after the first couple times of use, gets better in time</li>
    <li> I have dental braces so it was quite tough to use dental floss. So for me it was a very helpful tool</li>
    <li> When Philips first announced the Airfloss, I asked my dentist about it.  He said that it would be good for people who don&#x27;t floss regularly, but was no replacement for flossing.  I flossed regularly, but was often frustrated when I could see, or feel, something between my teeth, but couldn&#x27;t get it out with floss or other devices.  I finally bought the Airfloss.  When I first got it, I tried flossing first, then using the Airfloss, then tried it the other way around.  What I found was that either way, both removed additional items.  However, I seemed more successful at dislodging items with the Airfloss.  I ended up using the Airfloss exclusively unless there was something it just wouldn&#x27;t remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the instructions say to do one burst between each tooth, I do two, moving the head slightly to get a different angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had another check-up and my gums look good.  The dentist was impressed with the results of the Airfloss and told me to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do too many bursts between the same teeth (eg., if something is stuck,) your gums can hurt.  Basically, if flossing hurts your gums, this will hurt your gums, too.  If you are new to flossing, go easy at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This uses the same charger as the Sonicare toothbrushes.  That is a benefit to me because I only have to carry one charger on long trips.  Although, I should note that I have never had to recharge this on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that my bag seems to get a longer look going through TSA when I carry this.</li>
    <li> My dentist said get this one and I did. Not as messy as the other flossers.  With this you will floss more than once a day and the ease make it more fun than a chore.  I highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE I BOUGHT IT TO CLEAN UNDER MY IMPLANTS . IT DOES SOME OF WHAT I WANTED IT TO DO . I WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Works great - no complaints.  For a person who doesn&#x27;t like to floss, this is a good alternative.  It would be nice if it came with a travel case.</li>
    <li> Worked well as a gum stimulator and water flosser... but it quit after two months.  I had tossed the packaging and haven&#x27;t checked out the possibility of returning it to Amazon</li>
    <li> New technology that really works..it reaches between teeth and blasts debris out! It is easy to operate and control. It is actually fun.</li>
    <li> Does not take the place of traditional flossing but is good in a pinch.Very messy. Careful of the button going off in another direction.</li>
    <li> It was worthless. It had very little power. Using dental floss the old fashioned way is much more successful. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> For those of you who share my obsession with oral hygiene, this device is for you. I manually flossed after using it and only picked up the smallest of plaque. It&#x27;s much more effective than using Plackers (or using nothing at all which is what most people use.) The proof will be in my next dental cleaning but this looks promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AFTER ONE MONTH OF USE: I had some bleeding in one section of my gums when I flossed last night. I had thought the product would enable me to skip flossing - not the case. It&#x27;s still a highly effective tool but you need to floss. I&#x27;d still buy it again but with that caveat.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine in July of 2011. I liked how it worked and was a good match with my Sonicare toothbrush. No, it isn&#x27;t as good as manual flossing, but at least I was using it. After about 6 weeks it stopped working. Acted like it wasn&#x27;t charging and the piston wouldn&#x27;t move. Phillips replaced it. About another 6 weeks and the replacement died. Put it on the shelf disgusted. Several months later took out the Dremel and cut the case in half. The motor had stains on it and the circuit board on the bottom had heavy corrosion on it. I suspect that an internal leak had caused the corrosion and the corrosion bridged contacts on the board that affected the charging. OK, called Philips a third time and along came the second replacement. This one also worked about 6 weeks and then also died. I like the product, except for the bad internal design. Come on Philips, you are a leading worldwide provider of medical devices, can&#x27;t you do better than this.</li>
    <li> I bought the airfloss along with the Sonicare toothbrush.  It was more difficult to use and took longer to do the job than regular dental floss.  It might work well for some people who have small mouths and stubby fingers.</li>
    <li> What a great product!!! Easy to use, fast, and efficient....I love it. No hassle flossing..really...just a burst of water, or mouthwash, quickly removes what my regular floss could not. I loved it so much that I bought a couple of flossers for my children who are grown and do not live at home. A+++ product</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago, on the firm recommendation of my dentist.  It is a very good product.  I am pleased with it.  You just have to be used to the small \\&quot;stapling\\&quot; sound when gunning it between teeth.  The water or mouthwash splashes on your mirror (so just wipe if off) and drips down your chin (so have a napkin or washcloth below your chin).  It removes imbedded debris between your teeth and would last 23 flosses, which should be enough each time you use it.  I use mouthwash and I have no problem with the mechanism.  The charge sure lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have owned other Philips products and have generally been satisfied so I thought I would be getting the same quality with this product. Not so - this thing is absolutely useless for cleaning teeth. It sends a burst of water and air like a broken spray can. Extra useless if you have tight teeth like I do. Hopefully Amazon takes it back and I can go buy a Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I passed it on to my wife and she loves it so I went from one star to three. I suppose it is an individual experience.</li>
    <li> The product is great when it works, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. It stopped recharging after about 6 months (my sister complained that hers stopped recharging after 2 months). A great disappointment.</li>
    <li> I am now waiting for my 4th replacement. It&#x27;s a great product when it&#x27;s working. Does not last more than a couple of months. My wife&#x27;s water pik lasted over 3 years before it lost some of its power, but was still working when she just bought a new one.  This one just completely dies. The customer service reps were all outstanding. I wish they get it right this time because I love the product.    I gave up and am back to the Waterpik    I decided to give it one more try.  It lasted three months and bombed out.  That&#x27;s definitely it.  I threw the flosser into the garbage and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Blows my interdental spaces very very well. A good addition to the normal dental care. Doesn&#x27;t fully replace flossing though.</li>
    <li> Like most people I hate flossing, but I love my Sonicare toothbrush, so I thought if I get this at least I&#x27;ll use it everyday, even though it won&#x27;t be as good as flossing, it&#x27;ll still be better than nothing. Well it didn&#x27;t quite work out that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device just doesn&#x27;t work as elegantly as their toothbrush. First after filling it with water you have to prime it to get the air out of the system. Then you have to aim it just right between the teeth or the water will just bounce right back or stop in the flosser (I hope any sort of blowback is not causing any damage to the flosser). Using it with mouthwash cause excess foam and bubbling in my mouth. The sensation of jet of water and air hitting mine tongue is not all that pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For testing, I flossed right after using flosser a few times, and each time I got as much junk out with the floss as I would without using the flosser, so I&#x27;m not sure if it really is doing anything. One time I got some food stuck between my teeth and tried to remove it with the flosser, but couldn&#x27;t after several tries, and ended up had to use floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the first unit I received died just after 1 week of use, luckily amazon&#x27;s hassle free replacement saved the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use the device, but it did not live up to my expectation. One good thing is you can charge it with the same charger for the toothbrush, and unlike the toothbrush, there&#x27;s no seam at the bottom for all the nasty stuff to get stuck in.</li>
    <li> Gets small particles of food out from between my teeth. Way easier then flossing, before this I only flossed once a month.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like flossing at all like me this is a very good alternative! Im not a dentist but I&#x27;m sure that if you compare not flossing at all and using the Sonicare the benefits are with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Plus its not getting messy like with the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> My Philips Sonicare HX8111/30 Airfloss broke less than 2 weeks after purchase. I registered my product as required. I contacted Philips when my airfloss stopped working (the button to spray simply won&#x27;t work). They customer support was entirely unhelpful and impolite. Also, they are clearly not English Speakers as they used made up words and were generally not making any sense. The customer representative basically told me that he would have to have me run a lot of checks on my airfloss and then he could send me a part so I could fix it. i.e. I would be installing a new handle on my brand new airfloss. That basically ended the conversation and I hung up. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they tried to charge me for shipping of the part to fix their faulty product; however I didn&#x27;t get that far in the conversation. I do not have the time or energy to repair Philips malfunctioning equipment. I would not recommend buying anything from Philips.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just over two weeks now, and it just does not have that Sonicare “excitement” that is in their toothbrush line.  The water reservoir is too small, this product in not a replacement for flossing, like it claims to be.  The water reservoir cap does not provide a good seal so the unit will leak in a travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a bit messy with all the water spray, so if you plan to use it out of the shower, have window cleaner and paper towels ready to clean that mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have hard water where I live, so I do wonder what kind of lifespan I am going to get out of it before I have a pressure issue, and when that does happen, how do I go about decalcifying the water pump?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the idea of the Airfloss, but it comes across more as a gimmick, than a daily tool that I can use in my daily life.  It is not as “thought out” as their toothbrush line, and if it is going to take up a charge plug and space it my bathroom, it needs to be streamlined quite a bit more!  It does not live up to the Sonicare pedigree!</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star rating despite the fact that I had to reorder a replacement Airfloss today because there&#x27;s something wrong with the gears in it. It makes loud grinding noises like a gear is slipping, which isn&#x27;t what its supposed to do. The Phllips folks were very nice and are shipping me a new one, no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Airfloss for a month and can say for a certainty that I floss way more using the Airfloss than I did using the traditional dental floss, I floss faster and with less discomfort using the Airfloss, and my gums feel much better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strange when you first use this product because of the burst of water that is used but once you have tried it you&#x27;ll love the results.  Easy and effective.  Hint:  Do keep your face aimed towards the sink or your mirror will probably end up splashed.</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended this product and it is so easy to use! I recommend it to anyone with dental issues...bridges and implants.</li>
    <li> I hate to floss, so this is perfect for me.  My parents tried it out while they were visiting and ordered one too they liked it so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m anal when it comes to dental care.  I grew up poor and for years couldn&#x27;t go to the dentist.  When I went after ~13 years, the doctor was amazed at how good my teeth looked.  That being said, I was hesitant to move over to this when my hygienist said it was probably a good idea.  After hours of research, I settled on this and am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Airfloss provides my mouth with a clean, incredible feeling and keeps my gums strong and protected against gum diseases.  From the first day using it, I could tell the difference.  I use water, not mouthwash like some people.  I tried that and found it caused my gums to be too sensitive and took longer to get them clean because of the intensity.  I chose water which still cleans out between my teeth and provides that awesome clean feeling!  Do I think it&#x27;s better than traditional flossing?  No, but it definitely comes close and I wouldn&#x27;t use it if I didn&#x27;t think it was bad.</li>
    <li> I received the proper product within the allotted time frame, the price was excellent and I will buy from this seller again.  My gums were getting bad due to the medications I have to take.  I thought there was nothing I could do and was facing the real possibility of having my gums scraped.  Within 3 months of using this (a different one) my dentist told me my gums are back to great at every tooth!  It is more than worth the price just in dental bills savings alone.  Not to mention it feels good.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a little messy at first but that goes away with experience.  I wish the directions included with the product was a little more than just simple drawings.  I have recommended this to my friends and have enjoyed the results myself.</li>
    <li> I thought I don&#x27;t have to floss any more, but...... my dentist said: Yes, you do! Too bad. But, it works.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s orthodontist recommended this for cleaning his mouth around his expander and braces. Works great! Food just pours out.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Ok, I guess, but no substitute for a Waterpik.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist recommended this flosser to help him deal with gum problems. My husband and I both use it and it works very well. You can use plain water or an oral rinse product. It really cleans the gum line and between teeth. I was skeptical, but am glad we got it.</li>
    <li> After using a WaterPik for years I was eager to try this battery-powered device.  I sometimes need to refill the very small reservoir, but it is easy to do.  The pulse blast cannot be varied, like the WaterPik, but it is quite effective.</li>
    <li> I could never floss my teeth because my teeth are too close together and the floss would break between my teeth. With the Phillips Sonicare the pulse of air and water ( I use mouth wash) I actually feel the water and air getting between my teeth. I bought 2, one for my wife who flosses two or three times a day. At first she was skeptical about how good it would floss. Now she uses it exclusively.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  it uses a combination of water and air to floss between teeth but it does not work near as well as good old fashioned waxed floss.  if you want a machine to floss your teeth I think the water pik would be better choice.  I love my Sonicare toothbrush, but this Airfloss is sadly lacking.</li>
    <li> it worked fine until it broke after three months. now i have to go through the expense and aggravation of getting it getting it fixed under warranty. i hope</li>
    <li> This is a great flosser, I hate to floss with any string and just wont floss if I have to use the string.  I used the hummingbird until it was sadly discontinued.  Even then I would still get pesky cavities in between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Since buying this product two years ago, I am happy to report (based on my yearly  teeth cleaning today)  I have not had any cavaties in two years for the very first time. That pretty much says it all!  :)</li>
    <li> This thing sure beats traditional flossing which takes forever and is a pain in the neck. Much easier and maybe more effective.</li>
    <li> Not as good as other flossers like Hydrofloss which is more powerful but not portable. I had to refill the small reservoir 3 times and having to constantly push the button is quite annoying coming from a hydrofloss where you hold a button to stop the flow of water. I used regular floss after using this and found chunks of food between molars and despite the fact I had used this two times in those area it did not dislodge the food particle. Nothing so far is a replacement for regular floss but still waiting for that magic product that works</li>
    <li> It seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to but following up with real floss gets more crud out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have to floss after using it I&#x27;m not entirely sure why I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> At first a little scary when yo feel the air/liquid puffs, but you get used to it very quickly.  I prefer this one over the old-fashioned flossing, much gentler and it works.</li>
    <li> A healthy routine which alway seemed a chore has become a welcome habit. This product made it so easy, as well as refreshing!</li>
    <li> I have braces in this thing works perfect. Flossing with braces yet the front flossed each teeth in and around each time and have to move it through the brakes. This is so easy takes so little time the floss. I feel this is exactly the same as flossing!</li>
    <li> three of these were purchased, two for gifts.  We were not that impressed with how the flow of water or mouth wash comes out.</li>
    <li> Great product when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Bought two, second still working. Would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Expected a lot more from Phillips product line.</li>
    <li> In short, this is a glorified, (wireless) waterpik, that combines water and air but I have been using it the past few days, and all I can say is, no more dental floss! The spaces between my teeth are clean as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> It is a gimmick. Water picks do a much better job of flossing. Even a flossing thread does a better job.</li>
    <li> This flosser sat in my basket for a time while I saved up enough money to buy it. (Following my dentist&#x27;s recommendations is sometimes more than I can afford.). When I ordered it I received a notice there was something?vwrong and the produce had been temporarily removed from my basket. Voila, came a notice it was now available … for seven dollars more. I  can&#x27;t evaluate the flosser until I recover from my 2 star disappointment with  Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a very difficult time flossing. The tops of many of my teeth are VERY close together, and a significant amount of force is needed to pull the floss through them and down, but the bases of my teeth are not so wide and close together, which means that when the floss comes through, I end up cutting my gums open with it. It&#x27;s as unpleasant as it sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device seems to work very well. I use it in between brushing and rinsing with mouth wash. I&#x27;ve noticed many more small bits of food being expelled during the rinse. I must assume that means this device is doing it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stream of water it shoots is very powerful. The head of this thing even kicks a little when it shoots the water out. It can be a bit difficult to get acclimated to, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible way to clean around teeth and gums.  It was a bit awkward at first, but now I&#x27;ve mastered it and use it daily.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for cleaning your teeth. It makes a loud noise and doesn&#x27;t really do much. Very pricey for what it does.</li>
    <li> Easy to use kind of messy as you will get mouth wash or water splashes which is unavoidable but minor. Again I like Phillips products I had no issue using this haven&#x27;t had to charge for a bout 2 weeks now so the battery is really good looks nice and is a great way to floss in the 21st century.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old Water-Pik. I like being able to push at each tooth position, smaller and seems to hold the two week charge like advertised.</li>
