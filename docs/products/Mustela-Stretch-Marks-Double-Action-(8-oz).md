      <li>I was pregnant</li>

      <li>I always bought these creams when I was pregnant twice</li>

      <li>I was pretty excited, as you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The must amazing cream not only stretch marks  </li>
      <li>I recently purchased this product again (in preparation for baby #2) at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>Every time I paid the $35/tube I cringed, but not having stretch marks at age 35 is worth it.  </li>
      <li>However, when I feel my skin pulling I apply this lotion and it take the pain away fast!</li>
      <li>I got stretch marks with both my first pregnancies.</li>
      <li>With my second pregnancy I got more.</li>
      <li>I will recommend this to any expectant moms I meet ;-)</li>
      <li>I think this stuff really works!</li>
      <li>I was pregnant with twins, and although I only made it to 24 weeks, my stomach was HUGE.</li>
      <li>I love Mustela products because they are non-greasy and keep you moisturized all day long.  </li>
      <li>During my first trimester, I would itch so much</li>
      <li>I highly recommend that you follow the directions stated on the bottle, and use DAILY for better results.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen any signs of stretch marks, which normally I see them right</li>
      <li>but my mother has large stretch marks from her pregnancies.  </li>
      <li>A definite must have for any pregnant woman.!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently eight months pregnant and my belly&#x27;s not only humongous, it&#x27;s as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
      <li>but... in the last couple of weeks my stomach was full of them.</li>
      <li>considering it is for a pregnant women, it scored very high (which is not good) on the level of toxicity on the safe cosmetics database site.</li>
      <li>I rub a decent amount in a circular motion all over my belly area.</li>
      <li>I got pregnant initially</li>
      <li>My mother when she was pregnant with me got enormous stretchies, and I did get them when I went through puberty, so</li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product at a discount for my unbiased review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been recommended this product by my friends who recently had babies and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks (they were using Mustela on regular basis for more than 7 months).  </li>
      <li>I used this lotion (and tried a handful of others, including Palmers which I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of) and highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more when needed to use postpartum for a few months as well</li>
      <li>As someone said on a different review, the cream doesn&#x27;t seem completely absorbed</li>
      <li>I never knew how dry your tummy area skin could get while pregnant.</li>
      <li>This lotion definitely helps keep your skin hydrated while pregnant which is essential in the stretch mark prevention process.</li>
      <li>No stretch marks so far</li>
      <li>This mustela has really helped with the itching of my back in places</li>
      <li>I develop stretch marks on my arms near my arm pits and under my biceps.</li>
      <li>Purchase this to start using fairly early on in my pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>it is very sticky so not only does it get all over your clothes...</li>
      <li>While some women like the smell, there are some of us that were sensitive to the smell and couldn&#x27;t help but throw up each time we applied the cream.  </li>
      <li>If you do not use this lotion at an early stage in pregnancy, you should not  expect for it to work.</li>
      <li>I did notice that I had an old scar on my belly which started fading soon after I used the lotion.</li>
      <li>I began using this cream and it has not only reduced the appearance of my old stretch marks, I have not gotten any new ones yet --</li>
      <li>We live in the high mountain dessert and it is very dry here.</li>
      <li>The skin was just dry and stretching too much.</li>
      <li>Then I developed red stretch marks around my belly throughout my pregnancy.</li>
      <li>I used Mustela almost twice a day beginning the second half of my first trimester with this pregnancy (I am 26 years old now) and used it until I had my daughter.</li>
      <li>The itching is mostly due to your skin stretching and pulling, including \\&quot;dryness\\&quot; which you really don&#x27;t want.  </li>
      <li>It does not appear to stain any of my clothes, however if it is not dry your clothes will stick to</li>
      <li>I used it twice daily, usually in the morning and evening and was grateful to not get any stretch marks while I was pregnant.  </li>

<li> I got NO new stretch marks.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m now 1 week shy of being 5 months pregnant and have been using this for about 2 months or so.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s definitely too strong for me and makes me sick each time I apply the cream.</li>
<li> The smell is not overwhelming, which may be a different story for other women as everyone is different during pregnancy.</li>
<li> Also, in the last few weeks I have had pain with my skin stretching out.</li>
<li> I tried cheaper lotions from the store that said they were meant for stretch marks, however, after a few hours they dried out and left my skin dry.</li>
<li> and they disappeared and kept away other stretch marks.</li>
<li> it stays the whole day on your body and makes the skin sticky (even if you apply a thin layer)!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband and I use this product for an intensive moisturizer and it works wonderfully. We live in the high mountain dessert and it is very dry here. This product is an incredible lotion that works better than any  I&#x27;ve tried. It has a pleasant smell, is thick and creamy and absorbs nicely - great for at night or under makeup.</li>
    <li> I used this product everyday, twice a day and even rubbed it in just like the directions said. 8 months in and no strech marks but... in the last couple of weeks my stomach was full of them. Don&#x27;t waste your money ladies.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion (and tried a handful of others, including Palmers which I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of) and highly recommend it.  I used it twice a day (a.m. and p.m.) so I went through about 3 tubes ($$$) from about the 4th month until the end and about a month afterwards.  I put it on my breasts, stomach, lower back and thighs/hips.  Zero stretch marks!  And I gained a lot of weight too -- I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and my max was 200 lbs.  Every time I paid the $35/tube I cringed, but not having stretch marks at age 35 is worth it.  The smell didn&#x27;t bother me at all, and I didn&#x27;t find it too greasy or staining.  And I used it a lot!  My mother when she was pregnant with me got enormous stretchies, and I did get them when I went through puberty, so I think this stuff really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 4th month of pregnancy and have been using Mustela for 1,5 month now. I&#x27;ve been recommended this product by my friends who recently had babies and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks (they were using Mustela on regular basis for more than 7 months).  I cannot comment on its results on stretch marks as I haven&#x27;t got any (yet).  2 drawbacks of the cream that I find very disturbing:  - smell- it&#x27;s definitely too strong for me and makes me sick each time I apply the cream. The smell rests a long time on the skin and the clothes absorb it, too.  - moisture- it stays the whole day on your body and makes the skin sticky (even if you apply a thin layer)!  I&#x27;ve been desperately looking for another product to replace this one (I really tried hard using Mustela for 1,5 month every morning- impossible to use it twice a day as recommended!) and just bought Bio Oil that I&#x27;m going to try.</li>
    <li> I got stretch marks with both my first pregnancies. I got pregnant initially when I was 16 and even with my youthful, elastic skin I still incurred stretch marks. With my second pregnancy I got more. This was before Mustela existed. I used Mustela almost twice a day beginning the second half of my first trimester with this pregnancy (I am 26 years old now) and used it until I had my daughter. I got NO new stretch marks. I was pretty excited, as you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I would forget to put it on, but mostly I followed the suggested usage. I will recommend this to any expectant moms I meet ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now 1 week shy of being 5 months pregnant and have been using this for about 2 months or so. No stretch marks so far, the smell does not annoy me like the shea butter/cream does... and it seem to help ease some of the tightness that I feel once in a while. Am planning to get more.</li>
    <li> Purchase this to start using fairly early on in my pregnancy.  Like most pregnant women, was concerned about stretch marks.  Liked the fact that it was fragrance free.  But I would not recommend this product to friends because 1) it is very sticky so not only does it get all over your clothes...it makes your clothes stick to your body 2) considering it is for a pregnant women, it scored very high (which is not good) on the level of toxicity on the safe cosmetics database site.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been day 1 of applying this cream, but I will update my post as soon as results or any changes come in. This cream smells really good and I like that my skin feels moisturized instead of oily when applied. The moisture for me stays on for about 7 hours. At this price, I&#x27;m hoping I see the same results all the other reviews are talking about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.*</li>
    <li> A definite must have for any pregnant woman.! I love Mustela products because they are non-greasy and keep you moisturized all day long.  You should start applying this lotion as soon as you find out you are pregnant. The product conditions your skin to prevent stretch marks. I also recommend you use this lotion on your hips, chest, and thighs. I am halfway through my pregnancy with baby number two. I don&#x27;t have any marks from my previous pregnancy. Idont have any now either and I am halfway through. Mustela keeps my growing belly from itching. I was lucky enough to receive this product at a discount for my unbiased review. I will be purchasing more when needed to use postpartum for a few months as well</li>
    <li> I began using this product at 8 weeks when I didn&#x27;t have stretch marks yet. Then I developed red stretch marks around my belly throughout my pregnancy. Unfortunately, at 4 months along, we lost our baby. It&#x27;s been almost 6 months and I still have stretch marks and they have gotten worse. However, the stretch marks didn&#x27;t get worse because of the lotion. I read in an article that stretch marks are due to the hormones in your body and lotions typically do not work.     I applied the lotion as directed and there are no changes at all. The lotion is sticky and does stick to your clothes. I&#x27;ve been using the product everyday for 8 months and there have been no changes! The only reason I&#x27;m using it is because I paid $40 for a tube of lotion.     I do not recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
    <li> After extensive research and the use of other products, I&#x27;ve settled with this cream.  As another reviewer said, stretch marks cannot be solely prevented via cream or topical medication, it is mostly due to the type of pregnancy and your genetic make-up.  However, its intensity, appearance, and scar can be controlled if properly taken care of.      When I was younger I had gained a great deal of weight and with the weight came the stretch marks.  I began using this cream and it has not only reduced the appearance of my old stretch marks, I have not gotten any new ones yet -- I&#x27;m currently eight months pregnant and my belly&#x27;s not only humongous, it&#x27;s as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  No marks, I can see a vein here and there, but it looks beautiful.    One of the main components that makes this cream successful is the fact that it keeps your skin moisturized (you have to understand your product).  As someone said on a different review, the cream doesn&#x27;t seem completely absorbed and that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s actually doing what it is supposed to be doing.  Otherwise, you will have to keep applying lotion all day long - with this Mustela, I only apply it once each morning after every shower.    Moreover, again, as someone else mentioned, the cream definitely soothes the itching you get all over your body.  The itching is mostly due to your skin stretching and pulling, including \\&quot;dryness\\&quot; which you really don&#x27;t want.  This mustela has really helped with the itching of my back in places I cannot reach that used to drive me insane.  During my first trimester, I would itch so much I&#x27;d make myself bumps that would bleed (I would scratch while sleeping and not know it).  I haven&#x27;t scratched at all since I began using this cream, but did scratch a couple of times when I forgot to put on the cream in the morning.    The only complaint I had with this is that during my first trimester the smell of it didn&#x27;t sit well with me.  I&#x27;d have to hold my breath and breathe through my mouth because I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  While some women like the smell, there are some of us that were sensitive to the smell and couldn&#x27;t help but throw up each time we applied the cream.  I wish they made an odorless version of it.    &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I tell EVERYONE about this cream.... I was pregnant with twins, and although I only made it to 24 weeks, my stomach was HUGE. I started getting stretch marks around my belly button. I started putting this stuff on my belly, twice a day and they disappeared and kept away other stretch marks. I know they say some people just don&#x27;t get stretch marks but I had some on my hips from when I was a teenager (they faded since, but goes to show I&#x27;m not immune from stretch marks).</li>
    <li> use together with dr Palmers butter and you&#x27;ll be fine! if possible, use almond oil and hipoglos too (from Brazil).</li>
    <li> I am 6 months pregnant and received this lotion from my mother after telling her I could not locate a lotion I liked. I tried cheaper lotions from the store that said they were meant for stretch marks, however, after a few hours they dried out and left my skin dry. I never knew how dry your tummy area skin could get while pregnant. Also, in the last few weeks I have had pain with my skin stretching out. However, when I feel my skin pulling I apply this lotion and it take the pain away fast! The skin was just dry and stretching too much. I used to forget to use this everyday but now I use it after I get out of the shower. I rub a decent amount in a circular motion all over my belly area. I can feel it moisturizing my skin as soon as I apply it. I love the smell of it; it is very clean and fresh. I would recommend letting it air dry for at least 20 minutes before dressing. It does not appear to stain any of my clothes, however if it is not dry your clothes will stick to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it is expensive but a little of this lotion goes a long way. One bottle will last me throughout the pregnancy. After using this I will not go back to store bought brands or regular lotion, this one works!</li>
    <li> I swore by this stuff when I was pregnant!  I used it twice daily, usually in the morning and evening and was grateful to not get any stretch marks while I was pregnant.  I recommended it to friends during their pregnancies and they experienced similar results. Another great thing about this lotion is the smell... It is very light and pleasant which when you are pregnant, your sense of smell heightens so personally, just the thought of using something like cocoa butter turned me off.  I recently purchased this product again (in preparation for baby #2) at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I used this product through both of my pregnancies and I am happy to say that I have no stretch marks.  I know they say that stretch marks are genetic and there is little that you can do to prevent them, but my mother has large stretch marks from her pregnancies.  I don&#x27;t think that it hurts to try this!    The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the scent.  I was nauseous for all 9 months each time I was pregnant and I wish an unscented version were available.  The scent isn&#x27;t too bad, but when you&#x27;re not feeling well to begin with it&#x27;s just one more thing that flares the nausea.</li>
    <li> I always bought these creams when I was pregnant twice and I have no stretch marks, it also smells great and feel awesome on your skin.</li>
    <li> Sounds very weird, but actually got this because I am in the process of losing a lot of weight and building muscle, and every time I go through my slimming phase I develop stretch marks on my arms near my arm pits and under my biceps. I needed a product that would moisturize and firm throughout this to keep the skin from having stretch marks appear. So far so good, I&#x27;ve been applying it using the instructions on the bottle and I haven&#x27;t seen any signs of stretch marks, which normally I see them right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a bodybuilder/weightlifter and experience stretch marks due to rapid weight loss or muscle growth, then this will work great for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this stuff is fantastic even if you&#x27;re not going through a pregnancy. Please note that I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and un-biased review, however, that has in no way affected my review here today and I would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> my wife used this before during her first pregnancy and the results were very good. It&#x60;s totally worthy!  very nice</li>
    <li> The must amazing cream not only stretch marks  but is also a hydration cream. Smell really nice that a + when you pregnant ..i used morning and night time i used this cream with all my pregnancy and my skin look amazing</li>
    <li> This lotion definitely helps keep your skin hydrated while pregnant which is essential in the stretch mark prevention process. The smell is not overwhelming, which may be a different story for other women as everyone is different during pregnancy. If you do not use this lotion at an early stage in pregnancy, you should not  expect for it to work. I did notice that I had an old scar on my belly which started fading soon after I used the lotion. I highly recommend that you follow the directions stated on the bottle, and use DAILY for better results. I received this item at a discounted price in return of an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Before I actually try thus product i read a lot of reviews, so  I decide to give it a chance it work good for me, the smell it&#x27;s not so great but i can handle it, i think i will order it again during my pregnancy .</li>
