      <li>I did notice that in the product picture, the wig&#x27;s tips seem to have golden highlights which mine doesn&#x27;t have, but I&#x27;m happy with the color anyway.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone I know because the product I received looked nothing like the one in the picture,and I may have liked it and gave a better rating if it did.</li>

      <li>the color is really nice and it kind of lightens up even more toward the ends more like a strawberry light brown if that makes sense ..</li>
      <li>It feels wonderful, looks beautiful, the color is awesome, I love how it hangs and doesn&#x27;t end up a big tangle (even when running outside in it), but this is my first day with it</li>

      <li>I haved owned over 50 wigs, and have literally bought better at a dollar store..</li>
      <li>The curls on this wig was lovely along with the color.....</li>
      <li>Well because this is wig, so it is not really terrible condition for this wig&#x27;s prise though</li>
      <li>oh well i actually love the curls at the ends..</li>
      <li>its more like a one time event wear</li>
      <li>Okay guys I&#x27;m a wig person I wear them quite often</li>
      <li>But the layers, bangs and style are cute.</li>
      <li>I wanna buy more</li>
      <li>Most wigs don&#x27;t do that, but this one sure does.</li>
      <li>but wig i received is more a mix of honey-golden-dark blond shades.</li>
      <li>lol i just notice that wig is suppose to be straight</li>
      <li>Overall, a good product and a great seller.</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s more redish tones to the color.</li>
      <li>Also, the straps in the back make it very easy to adjust to fit, fits me perfect!</li>
      <li>I was very excited I got my delivery so soon</li>
      <li>I received my wig today and it&#x27;s beautiful and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased three wigs from Cool2day,(aside from this one) and I loved them so much!</li>
      <li>Its beautiful and soft.</li>
      <li>Great wig that looks very natural for roles requiring longer hair.</li>
      <li>Easy to style</li>
      <li>but it got tangled soooo easily</li>
      <li>no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
      <li>Yeah, great price, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth it...</li>
      <li>however you would like, I had cut mine which was easy to do.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to style.</li>
      <li>However it sheds and tangles easily</li>
      <li>Otherwise, everything is fine.</li>
      <li>I am very impressed for the price, but a little peeved that the description flat-out lied.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Product details of this wig said that it&#x27;s light brown</li>
      <li>It fits well and its comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great wig for the price.</li>
      <li>When I ordered this product, it said that it&#x27;s light brown</li>
      <li>barely fit me as if it was for a child .</li>
      <li>It looks really natural and would look good on anyone.</li>
      <li>I was very upset with what I was sent!!!</li>
      <li>it looks really nice and realistic.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for a pre teen and a budding princess!</li>
      <li>I WAS EXCITED WHEN IT CAME.</li>
      <li>This wig will definitely be worth your money!</li>
      <li>The customer service from &#x27;PDS Online&#x27; was pretty sweet :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I love how natural and healthy the color looks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing so much soft amazing natural looking hair for the cheap price</li>
      <li>Barbie has more realistic hair!</li>
      <li>It fits great and when I took it out of the packaging there was a pair of pink booties as a gift.</li>
      <li>The construction of the wig is very well done with adjustable straps built in to the back to create a great fit.  </li>
      <li>The color is almost a light brown with strawberry blonde highlights :) Love it though</li>
      <li>I have no idea what these girls are talking about, I bought this wig because of the reviews but this wig isn&#x27;t true to the color it shows mine is so gold</li>
      <li>but it looks natural and keeps it wave nicely.</li>
      <li>Not bad for a wig in this price</li>
      <li>yes, I know other people are happy with their purchase-if you&#x27;re reading my opinion on it, just take it as an opinion, and from someone who has worn wigs for the majority of her lifespan.</li>
      <li>Cute, silky, and somewhat realistic looking.</li>
      <li>The color is really beautiful -- there are several shades of brown in it, so it looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it out and about yet, but it fits well (and adjustably), and is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very soft, very light brown wig.</li>

    <li> I got my wig  today (it arrived on time scheduled) and i have to say that is a great quality wig for the price! I love it!! it looks really nice. Hair is silky, soft and feels like natural hair to the touch. It fits well and its comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product details of this wig said that it&#x27;s light brown but wig i received is more a mix of honey-golden-dark blond shades. I was hoping a real brown shade even so im happy with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a wig cap as a gift. Good seller, good product</li>
    <li> The adjustable part sticks out and makes the wig sit weird on my head. I also had to trim the hair because it was not shaped properly and it tangles easily and it very difficult to untangle.</li>
    <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the details, but it is way too big for my head</li>
    <li> This wig is a awesome addition to her collection and she really enjoys changing her look. In just minutes Bang a new look</li>
    <li> when i got it i loved it look just like the picture but it got tangled soooo easily, now i can only wear it in a pony tail because it looks weird</li>
    <li> I have received this wig in a decent amount of time considering it coming all the way from china. there has been an error in my previous order but the costumer service agent (her name is Jackie) was fabulous very very helpful and so amazing I got to keep the wrong wig and they shipped this one to me for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, it is so beautiful and light so it doesn&#x27;t give me any headaches and it is also very comfortable to wear. the color is really nice and it kind of lightens up even more toward the ends more like a strawberry light brown if that makes sense ..overall I m very happy with it and looking forward to wearing it outside .</li>
    <li> Cute, silky, and somewhat realistic looking. only issue is that the tips are not light and ombre like the photo. It is all one solid color. The bangs are a little weird but nothing scissors cant fix</li>
    <li> Reviews must be at least 20 words longTThis order came in very fast.... I have ordered close to 20 wigs from here and they always make me happy with there products and prices..... The curls on this wig was lovely along with the color..... &amp; the thickness was good to for the price...</li>
    <li> I have to say, I was really impressed with the quality I received for $10. Not bad for a wig in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am extremely irked by the fact that the description guarantees a \\&quot;skin-top\\&quot; wig, when it is actually netter (and black, so you can see it very plainly). Luckily, the wig is *mostly* thick enough to cover it anyway... Just a little bit of the black around the edge of the cap peeks through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap inside the wig is disproportioned, which irritates me because there are bumps all over my head where the fabric folds over. Even without using the hooks inside the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also very frizzy, but a little water to dry it straight might fix that... I just got it shipped, so I haven&#x27;t tried much styling yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love how natural and healthy the color looks. I am very impressed for the price, but a little peeved that the description flat-out lied. Not sure if I will order again in the future, but I will definitely get some use out of this one.</li>
    <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great wig for the price. However it sheds and tangles easily and the color is lighter than the picture shows. Aside from that, it&#x27;s a beautiful cut and fits well. It shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> The wig isn&#x27;t too bad, it is a much lighter color than I expected. It is pretty thin, looks like a wig... but it is affordable.</li>
    <li> The color I recieved was dark brown even though it was listed as light brown but that could be a difference of opinion I suppose. I have been having a very hard time getting it to stay on.</li>
    <li> This wig looks very natural (I added a little dry shampoo to take out some extra shine).  My only frustration is that the bangs are cut much heavier &amp; longer than in the picture, however, I can trim though to shape my face - much better to be too long than too short.</li>
    <li> loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head, no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
    <li> Great wig that looks very natural for roles requiring longer hair.</li>
    <li> ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I WAS EXCITED WHEN IT CAME. IT WAS SOFT AND CAME WITH A WIG CAP. A NET FOR PROTECTION. I WORE IT THE FOLLOWING DAY. ALL GOOD. SECOND DAY? TANGLED VERY BADLY AND WHEN ICOMBED IT, IT SHED TERRIBLY.i ALWAYS TAKE MY WIGS OFF AND PUT THEM BACK HOWI GOT THEM SINCE I DON&#x27;T HAVE WIG HEADS. LOST A CUSTOMER.</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely cute and adorable. I like the bangs and it&#x27;s easy to style. My only concern is the color on this wig because it&#x27;s not too light but it&#x27;s not too dark either. It&#x27;s somewhat in between. When I ordered this product, it said that it&#x27;s light brown but there&#x27;s more redish tones to the color. I may just have to dye it a different color but that&#x27;s not a problem. Overall, a good product and a great seller.</li>
    <li> When I got the wig, I got it the next day!! I did not pay extra for over night delivery, and still got it overnight-ed. It was a pleasant surprise to receive the wig, it was nicely packaged, and came with a cap for your head underneath. It also included a pair of socks, just as a gift, which I thought was nice (: The wig itself is great quality,  and very realistic looking. Also, the straps in the back make it very easy to adjust to fit, fits me perfect!</li>
    <li> I technically can&#x27;t review the wig because I have cancelled my order before it shipped. They were pretty timely about cancelling although the money has not been returned to my account yet. I looked over the wig again and went through some pictures and realized the wig is not for me. I am going to try extensions instead because I need something for ever day use after I suffered a poorly cut bob. The customer service from &#x27;PDS Online&#x27; was pretty sweet :)</li>
    <li> I wish I has received color In picture, but really nice hair. Really soft and shiny and pretty style.just like in photo. will order again in darker color</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, but it&#x27;s cute.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no bangs, and if you don&#x27;t know how to for sure, don&#x27;t cut it yourself as obviously it won&#x27;t grow back. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent wig very comfortable but the color did not look as I expected it was more of a lighter blond then what the picture looks like so I made a gift of It to my aunt she was happy</li>
    <li> Wore it to a costume party &amp; had many comments on how natural it looks.  As long as it is, it was easy to handle...brushable &amp; didn&#x27;t tangle at all. Excellent fit as well.</li>
    <li> The color is actually much lighter than in the picture, but under the sun it looks the same :) It is VERY CURLY, not straight at all. The color is almost a light brown with strawberry blonde highlights :) Love it though</li>
    <li> This wig is cute, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as real looking as some of my other wigs. It&#x27;s also prone to tangle and not stay nice during wear. But the layers, bangs and style are cute. So I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It is in fact really curvy. The wig is Not straight at all as the picture shown. Otherwise, everything is fine.</li>
    <li> Its not the same wig style .it got to me before expected but still not what I wanted .the wig  they sent it for a small head barely fit me as if it was for a child .</li>
    <li> I was very excited I got my delivery so soon (I got it today!). It told me I would get it between the 18th or 20th, I ordered it on the 13th, but I got it today on the 15th. It feels wonderful, looks beautiful, the color is awesome, I love how it hangs and doesn&#x27;t end up a big tangle (even when running outside in it), but this is my first day with it and I am hoping it stays this way. So far no real shedding issues but I do have one issue. When I took my wig off and set it down I saw the wig cap. I was very unhappy when I picked it up and saw it was very visible when holding it. When I had it on I checked but I didn&#x27;t see the same netting when on my head. Maybe I was being overly picky, but that is my only complaint other wise I love it! This is my 3rd wig from them :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife... She hates me now. So different than the picture. I have to return it.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty normal shape head but the head net feels a bit small, easy fix with Bobby pins  but it looks natural and keeps it wave nicely. I recommend using a water lotion mix to brush it out, makes it smell nice too.</li>
    <li> I am really hard to please,I have been using extentions for yrs and over the Past few months my hair was breaking from being blonde I had to cut it as short as a mans cut feeling ugly I bought this wig I got it in 3 days I was shocked!!!! It&#x27;s amazing so much soft amazing natural looking hair for the cheap price it&#x27;s beyond amazing!!!!!!!!! The color is so natural I wanted color on the ends for fun but it came plain. Cant complain for $8!</li>
    <li> I received my wig today and it&#x27;s beautiful and soft.Unlike the other reviewers I was hoping the color was a little lighter.It fits great and when I took it out of the packaging there was a pair of pink booties as a gift. this seller is the best i&#x27;ve encountered , she wrote me an email and was very courteous.</li>
    <li> I like it, I really do.  I haven&#x27;t worn it out and about yet, but it fits well (and adjustably), and is very pretty.  I did notice that in the product picture, the wig&#x27;s tips seem to have golden highlights which mine doesn&#x27;t have, but I&#x27;m happy with the color anyway.  The wig does tangle awfully easily, but I&#x27;m coming to think that&#x27;s a given with all wigs, and with gentle finger combing the tangles do come out.  All in all, I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very soft, very light brown wig. Easy to style however you would like, I had cut mine which was easy to do.</li>
    <li> I read good and bad reviews on this wig, but i still gave it a go at it! and i am glad i did because i love it! lol i just notice that wig is suppose to be straight...oh well i actually love the curls at the ends..it looks really nice and realistic. my bangs were able to stay to the left or right like the pic so i dont know y others are complaining about that...this is a good quality wig and to the person that said they can find a better one at the dollar store or so...well good luck! if u find one let me noe cause the ones there are so crappy and looks so unrealistic...oh and u said u were gonna throw it away? well send it to me!</li>
    <li> Costume Party wig. Tis wig will fool no one into believing it is real hair.  Additionally, even using proper wig tools it tangles easily and is difficult to de-tangle without pulling out fibers. In this case, the idiom &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will now be a gift for my 11 year old niece to use to play dress up.</li>
    <li> This is for my granddaughter to play with...can&#x27;t beat the price...but when we got it I was very surprised at the quality! It is perfect for a pre teen and a budding princess!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even wear it because it&#x27;s so shiny that you can really tell that it&#x27;s a wig &amp; that it&#x27;s not even a human hair wig... I&#x27;ll pass</li>
    <li> I have no idea what these girls are talking about, I bought this wig because of the reviews but this wig isn&#x27;t true to the color it shows mine is so gold u can tell its fake! The color of this wig isn&#x27;t a real hair color or even a color u can dye your hair I was very upset with what I was sent!!! Waste of money!!!!!</li>
    <li> The wig looked pretty realistic on arrival. I purchased it for a costume because in the picture it looked the closest to my character (Tara Knowles from Sons of Anarchy). It was much fuller and had loose ringlets, which didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but it was a discrepancy from the picture to the actual product. I ended up wearing it for Coachella with a pink knit slouch beanie and got plenty of compliments and had a blast.</li>
    <li> Nice wig but it looks like a wig for sure and not real hair, but it&#x27;s probably worth the price. I will probably use it for costume.</li>
    <li> Okay guys I&#x27;m a wig person I wear them quite often but this is not a everyday wiig its more like a one time event wear</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone I know because the product I received looked nothing like the one in the picture,and I may have liked it and gave a better rating if it did. The wig was one shade and did not have highlighted tips at all like the one in the picture and the bangs were completely different shaped and the bangs I had were WAY shorter. The wig was already tangling just after me trying it on so I could see if I could do anything with it.</li>
    <li> Barbie has more realistic hair! This wig looks ridiculous even for Halloween. I haved owned over 50 wigs, and have literally bought better at a dollar store.. I will probably just throw away.</li>
    <li> I was happily surprised by the quality of this wig.  The hair is silky and feels wonderful to the touch.  The color is really beautiful -- there are several shades of brown in it, so it looks very natural.  The construction of the wig is very well done with adjustable straps built in to the back to create a great fit.  I would definately buy this wig again and again.</li>
    <li> very soft wig, a bit on the sparse side compared to other wigs, but still enough hair to style! natural look. best to wear a hat/hair accessory with it to reduce the shine-look.</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful !! It looks really natural and would look good on anyone. The only problem is that it does tangle easily but adding a little hair serum seem to help a lot. I totally suggest this wig for everyday use most people can&#x27;t tell it is fake.</li>
    <li> Like my title.... It&#x27;s not bad but your hair looks really greasy and soft.... Well because this is wig, so it is not really terrible condition for this wig&#x27;s prise though</li>
    <li> Everyone says this looks like real hair. Its beautiful and soft. The only issue I had with it was that the part in the front was kinda ripped when I took it out. Other than that i absolutely adore it! Even my obnoxious 20 year old little brother didnt say a word about it. he just stared like wondering if it is real or not. lol. It arrived fast and Im so happy I purchased it. I wanna buy more so I can have them forever. I had really pretty hair but I cut it all off when my husband went to army basic training as a symbol of my patience and determination for him but I want to send him pretty pictures so I wanted long hair. :)</li>
    <li> The way the synthetic is connected is poor, you cannot comb, brush or much of anything to this hairpiece as it sheds terribly.</li>
    <li> I am sooo disappointed with this wig. In the pictures, the girl looks amazing in it, and I really liked the way it looked. Wasn&#x27;t too long, had enough bangs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is terrible quality. Yeah, great price, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth it...I could have spent just a few more bucks on a nicer looking wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I think that it&#x27;s terrible quality is because first, when I got it out of the box- it was frizzy. Not a big deal, brushed it out, looked nice. I played with it for a few minutes before putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top (where the bangs are) is really, really thin. The cap sees through! No matter what I do, I can still see it. I was hoping I could put my bangs to the side like in the picture, but I can&#x27;t. They just sit on my forehead, and I really, really don&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, since I&#x27;m on the cap, I&#x27;ll talk about that. It&#x27;s completely black, and it&#x27;s made differently than what I expected. I don&#x27;t expect a black lining where bangs are-most of the time, the wig makers just make the bangs thick enough if the color is black. I&#x27;m so upset with that. On top of that, it has no &#x27;ear caps&#x27; or &#x27;ear marks&#x27; or whatever you want to call them-that sit in front of your ears. It&#x27;s hard to teeter the wig evenly on my head without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, no matter how tight I tighten the wig, there is always a gap, and the cap bunches up on my head. Most wigs don&#x27;t do that, but this one sure does. No matter WHAT I do to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, with the negative things out of the way, I will say this-the hair is very pretty, and I love how nice it looks. But this wig just wasn&#x27;t made for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed with my purchase. I&#x27;ve purchased three wigs from Cool2day,(aside from this one) and I loved them so much! But I thought I would try something that was shorter. And unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t meet my high expectations, as I had hoped it would. I&#x27;ll stick to buying the other ways, maybe cutting them, I don&#x27;t know. But overall,I wasn&#x27;t happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I know other people are happy with their purchase-if you&#x27;re reading my opinion on it, just take it as an opinion, and from someone who has worn wigs for the majority of her lifespan. If it fits you, then that&#x27;s great! This wig will definitely be worth your money! But it wasn&#x27;t worth mine.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the picture. You can&#x27;t beat the value. I received several compliments. Only draw back is band around your head.Next time I won&#x27;t wear it as long.</li>
