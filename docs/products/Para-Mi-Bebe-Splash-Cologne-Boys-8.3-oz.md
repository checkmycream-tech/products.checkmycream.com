    <li> Fragrance reminds me of church incense. Won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I received it today, it smells so baby soft. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Great! Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;colonia\\&quot; it&#x27;s for babies but you can use after the shower like a body mist.   The aroma don&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours :(, but still pretty good.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Smells so good</li>
    <li> I used this for my son when he was a baby. All the moms in my family use this \\&quot;Para Mi Bebe\\&quot;. It smells very delicate and clean. I love it! Now I use it on my grandchild.</li>

    <li> very nice and refreshing especially when you are out in the sun for a long time.</li>
    <li> The cologne scent is very faint. The alcohol is more dominant. I also purchased the scent for girls. Same opinion on that one as well.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne my kids use it and I use it</li>
    <li> Second time I buy this product.  Great smell for a daily refreshing splash, not necessarily for a baby :-)</li>
    <li> I used this cologne years ago on my daughter when she was a baby. so I decided to purchase it again she nine years  old but I&#x27;m using it on my dog lol when I got it it remind me of when my daughter was a little bundle of joy it brought tears to my eyes it smells so good I would recommend this to anyone!</li>

    <li> Seems a little too spendy. Arrived later than I thought. The scent was not what I expected. I bought Denenes cologne and had twice as much volume for the same price, and the scent was so much more to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;Was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh citrusy scent, though.</li>
