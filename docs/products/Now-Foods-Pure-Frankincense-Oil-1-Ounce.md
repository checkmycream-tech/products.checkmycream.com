<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it for my patients that have arthritis and it is fantastic for facial skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G.H. Prichard, author of &amp;#34;Hunt for the Witch&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love it! It is the undiluted version of Now&#x27;s Frankincense oil and it smells wonderful! I was a little concerned I might get the diluted version per other reviews as I had smelled the diluted one at a local shop and it doesn&#x27;t smell right, but I ordered this undiluted one from NutriPlusTea and they sent me exactly what was advertised - 100% Frankincense, undiluted and it smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I would order it again from this seller as this version of the Now&#x27;s Frankincense is excellent!</li>
    <li> This frankincense smells just like I remember as a child.  Just discovering it again and the Now Foods oil is very good.  the price is right and shipping was very fast.  Beats running ll over town to find it too.</li>
    <li> Frankincense is expensive - this a great way to keep a quality staple in EOs</li>
    <li> I had received a small sample of frankincense oil from another order as a small sample. It smelled amazing! I wanted to order that one but because the company that sent it did not put their name on the sample, I had no idea who to order it from. So, I ordered this. This smells like turpentine. I am not sure which oil is how frankinscense is supposed to smell, but I was disappointed when I got this. Don&#x27;t think I would have ordered this if I could have smelled it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/13/2013: Buyer beware!! Yesterday, after reading another commenter&#x27;s review, I checked my bottle of frankincense I ordered from this seller. I MADE SURE when I ordered it that I ordered the 100% PURE frankincense, NOT the 20% blend. I DO NOT EVER purchase essential oil blends because it defeats the purpose. If I want it diluted, I am perfectly capable of doing that myself. Well I checked the bottle I was sent, and sure enough, I was sent the 20% blend, NOT the one I ordered.</li>
    <li> Somewhat dilute; not terribly strong.</li>
    <li> I was led to believe this was a 100% pure oil. It is not . It&#x27;s a 20% dilution with jojoba oil. The description should have said that, I would not have bought it.</li>
    <li> I use this oil to help relax me and get me into a meditative state.  It also helps at bedtime to help me fall asleep.  It only takes a few drops and lasts for quite awhile.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Arrived quickly.  Really nice, quality oil.  I&#x27;m trying to learn what franincense can do for an autoimmune disease (ankylosing spondylitis). Any information anyone has to offer on this, it is a stubborn, miserable disease. Thank you for the &#x27;order convenience&#x27; opportunities on Amazon, &amp; for those that place their nice products there.</li>
    <li> The ad represents this product as 100% frankincense oil.  It is not.  While I have no problem with a diluted product, it should clearly be marked on the site as what it is.  It should clearly represent as 20% frankincense 80% carrier oil.  I reported this to the seller and received no reply whatsoever.  While I believe NOW foods is a reputable natural foods company, I question the reseller.</li>
    <li> At my work, our office smells musty.  I place a couple of drops in a small dish of water and the room takes on a much fresher smell.</li>
    <li> Having not purchased Frankincense before I had nothing to compare with. The aroma is just as described. I love NOW&#x27;s pricing and I am certain that I will reorder from this site again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Frankincense Essential Oil since I really love the smell of Frankincense incense and resin when burned. Smelling it right out of the bottle is a little deceiving. It almost smells like some kind of spruce tree. It&#x27;s really strong. I was feeling a little burned but I decided to go ahead and mix it in with my carrier oil in different strengths just to see. It smells just like I had hoped it would once it&#x27;s diluted. I&#x27;m still testing out what concentrations I like the best but I&#x27;ve been testing [rubbing it on my arms] for days now and I&#x27;m really glad I ordered this. It may not be the highest quality Frankincense on the market but it&#x27;s perfect for an amateur, like me, who is just starting to make their own [all natural] products.</li>
    <li> Great for aromatherapy, and can use topical, yet it&#x27;s not therapeutic.</li>
    <li> Scent is ok, but I mainly use it to add a drop to sweet almond oil i put on my face to moisturize. It&#x27;s supposed to have a lot of wonderful medicinal properties. This bottle will last forever.</li>
    <li> Someone wrote not a pure product. This is the BEST product I have used and my wife and I have about 30 bottles of different NOW essential oils around the tub. I have tried other products even here on Amazon. This product is far superior to anything else I have bought and cheaper. I accidentally bought the 20% one once and it smells like a fresh car tire. I also have bought other makers stuff here on amazon and theirs smells like that stuff. I can open them both and compare them. I sent them back and that went well, however for someone to pick on NOW products must clearly be trying to dirty their name for some other reason. I have gone through hundreds of bottles of NOW products and I&#x27;m overly satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;Watch sellers here. Some sell 20% under this post and won&#x27;t take returns.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this Frankincense!  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!  So far I&#x27;ve been using a few drops in my bath water, and the best judge of a beautiful frankincense is its top notes which come sparkling through from the warmth of the water in the bath.  And this does just that.  The top notes in this oil is very lemony.  Would make a beautiful perfume that warms with the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchased Frankincense and wanted to incorporate it in a few DIY beauty products. I quite enjoy the smell, especially when mixed with the other oils I use. It was the same great quality oil I have come to expect from NOW. I would certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have recommended and shared my NOW Frankincense oil with a number of people since discovering its wonderful, calming effects. It&#x27;s many uses continues to amaze me. Great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product that works and smells good with one caviat: getting the correct product! This comes in a 100% frankincense version and a 20% frankincense version. They are both good, but I have been sent the wrong version more than once. Be sure you contact the seller upon ordering or before hand and make sure they are going to send the version you think you are trying to order!</li>
    <li> Purchase it for aged spots. Been using for a couple weeks seeing some lighting. I was told it would take a few weeks, so far so good. Also used it on my foot for gout and I noticed some of the swelling going down and pain subsiding.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Frankincense oil is extremely nurturing and just flat out amazing for your skin! Lightens the skin, say good bye to any sun spots or discoloration from extended time in the sun and a very useful anti-aging agent. The smell is quite strong but not at all unpleasant, smells fresh and exotic. I love all NOW Foods products, especially their essential oils. THIS OIL IS PURE, it is a quality product I personally recommend and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> we use it everyday ....love the smell..and it has medicinal benefits too!</li>
    <li> One of the best clean fragrances of all.</li>
    <li> I wanted what I use to buy in the under a dollar store it was thick and the scent was spicey and it lasted all day, this is thin and smells like turpentine horrible stuff</li>
    <li> Thank you but i want moor , how i can payment to shopping it to gather?</li>
    <li> I began suffering from painful headaches about one year ago, and they became so bad that I began taking Aleve daily. Without the Aleve, I could barely turn my head or stand up without feeling severe headache pain. I hate taking medications, so I started researching natural headache remedies, and I learned about using frankincense and peppermint essential oils for headache relief. I ordered the NOW peppermint oil first because it is less expensive. Each day, I would massage the peppermint oil on the areas where I had pain. The peppermint oil definitely provided some relief, but it did not completely eliminate the pain, and I still had to use Aleve at least once every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks, I decided to purchase this NOW frankincense oil. I use it in the same way I used the peppermint oil...simply rubbing it on the areas of my head where I feel pain and headache pressure. Ever since I started using this oil, I have not touched my bottle of Aleve. This oil completely eliminates my headaches in less than one hour. I also noticed that I don&#x27;t suffer as much from headaches since using this oil, and they are not as painful when they do occur. I&#x27;m just amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost invested in a much more expensive brand, but I&#x27;m glad I do not have to since this oil works so well for me. I carry this oil with me wherever I go.</li>
    <li> This smells a little different from YL frankincense, but it seems to work just fine in my diffuser.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for as gift, I must have been in a hurry because I read nowhere that this is only 20% oil and the rest cheapo filler.</li>
    <li> NOW has a vast line of essential oils. 100% pure grade, have been using them in products, love it will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I use it on an annoying ganglion cyst. Takes time, but it did go away. Also, you have to keep using it or it will show up again. Great smell too!</li>
    <li> This oil is our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for everything! There are so many uses for this oil.  I got rid of warts on a finger with this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered my bottle in April 2013 and mine says 100% pure frankincense on the front label. Ingredients: 100% pure frankincense oil. It does say in the caution part of the label in the last sentence, \\&quot;Not for internal use.\\&quot; I&#x27;m thinking of trying it in some honey anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that received a diluted version of this product, I&#x27;m sorry to hear that. This product smells great.</li>
    <li> This an amazing price for a full 1 oz therapy grade essential oil!  I have paid this price many times for those small little tiny bottles in health food stores many times!  This is a great bargain, for a wonderful product!  I am always happy with the NOW brand!</li>
    <li> This Frankincense oil smells better than others I have tried. The smell is not too chemically strong. I really like it. I used it at nights and it has helped with my dark spots a ton. I love it. I helps dry my acne very fast.</li>
    <li> so many good things this oil can do!. I had a little bump on my wrist...dont remember what those are called, but I put some oil on it for about 3 months and it disappeared. I use a drop on my forehead and a drop of Cedarwood at base of neck. Take about give clarity and alertness. Gets one out of that &amp;#34;fog-like&amp;#34; feeling. I also use this oil in my homemade pain cream mixes.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly, as described, well protected, competitive price.</li>
    <li> I have used both brands now and can&#x27;t tell a difference.  I use Myrrh and Frankincense mixed on my face and LOVE it.  Good brand, great price.</li>
    <li> Great year-round scent and good for medicinal purposes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this oil in Jojoba oil in my made to hold oil night light in my bathroom. I add a few drops of Sweet Orange, too. It smells good. It&#x27;s perfect for the holiday season.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Essential Oil thinking it was 100% pure (as advertised) and when I examined the bottle I noticed there was a 20% blend with another oil. I really, really can&#x27;t stand false advertisement,</li>
    <li> I was a little worried when ordering this since I saw several reviews stating that they had received a blend.  I definitely did not want a blend.  So I was extremely happy to see that what I received was 100% Frankincense Oil as advertised.  Have not tried it yet and this is the first time I have bought Frankincense, so can&#x27;t compare it to others.  I can just say that the price was extremely reasonable and I got what I ordered and got it fast!  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I find this works very well, I just double drops</li>
    <li> With all the bad reviews about customers receiving the 20% blend when they ordered the 100% - I wanted to report that Seller  NutriPlus Teas sent the 100% frankincense oil which I ordered.  As for the oil, the NOW brand isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;fine\\&quot; and silky as doTERRA&#x27;s oil, but the aroma is pleasant, and the price is affordable. Good for an everyday relaxation oil.</li>
    <li> Works well in my lotion&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> First bottle of frankincense purchased (can&#x27;t compare to other &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; EO companies) but hope it&#x27;ll do the job!</li>
    <li> I received the essential oil quickly and it was at a great price! I would recommend this product and this company.</li>
    <li> Something sooo old, dating back to Biblical times, is still a useful item in our day and age.  God sure has a plan.</li>
    <li> This seems to be every bit as good as another brand I&#x27;ve smelled that comes in a much smaller 1 dram bottle, costing around $29.&lt;br /&gt;From the picture and description I was not 100% positive at the time of ordering if this was the 100% Frankincense, or the already cut version from NOW that is only about 20 or 25% Frankincense.  This is the 100% un-cut version of the product.</li>
    <li> I was crossing my fingers on this one since I read that often times people received a lesser quality of this oil.  Well I am happy to say that I received the 100% oil.  It arrived within a week to HI and was well packed in bubble wrap.</li>
    <li> Now foods has been a reliable source of essential oils for my personal use these past 8 years. We often diffuse a blend of Frankincense and Myrrh throughout our home for a sense of well-being and grounding. The scents and the properties work synergistically so I&#x27;m reviewing both of them together in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense is often used in both incense and perfumes.  Few realize Frankincense is also known as Boswellia and in that form has been ingested for literally thousands of years as a supplement (do NOT ingest essential oils without the direction of a qualified practitioner!) &amp;#34;Frank&amp;#34; as the oil is known is credited with many healing properties.  Be sure to do your research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myrrh has been notably used as a perfume, incense and medicine, some claim it can be ingested in wine though I generally never ingest essential oils because of their potency. Myrrh is also known for all things circulatory and involving the uterus, hence it&#x27;s commonly used with Frankincense (and I like to have both infusing when I&#x27;m taking salvia miltiorrhiza aka red sage or dan shen.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewer&#x27;s tip of the day:  The three wise men were bearing gifts of Frankincense, Myrrh and Gold.  The Magi&#x27;s blend is known to be one of the most healing of all essential oil blends - a blend of Frankincense, Myrrh and Helichrysum also commonly referred to as &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; in ancient days.  Note: Some references cite &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; as Balsam Fir which is native to North America hence it would not have been included in the ancient Magi&#x27;s formula.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> Now Foods always delivers on quality I swear. I absolutely LOVE this fragrance..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense is like a rainbow of aroma.. It is almost as if you are smelling 30 different scents at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first sniff it straight from the bottle it hits you with a very bright and sweet, fruity note. But then when it is allowed to rest on your skin, that is when you can fully appreciate its beauty..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense has a very earthly under tone which holds it all together, but you will discover a subtle camphor-like quality that is almost minty but citrusy all at the same time.. Yet it is neither. This aroma is rather difficult to describe. It is thoroughly luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a staple in my oil collection for sure</li>
    <li> Shipped right away! Thanks for this fine product! I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I will almost certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchase a lot of oils for burning.  The Now line produces a clean quality.  I have ordered many of their oils, and I have been pleased with all.  Price for the quality is also good.</li>
    <li> The 100% pure Frankincense oil is the only one I purchase it seems to keep the condition of my skin much better. I blend this with Myrrh oil and apply it daily.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for me.  I like to mix with Lavender Oil and use morning and evening.</li>
    <li> someone should write a song about this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this Frankincense.  I add it, along with Orange EO to Apricot oil to hydrate my skin after showering.  I dab some on my wrists &amp; put a drop in my hair so that I am enveloped in a cloud of this heavenly fragrance.  I cannot say enough about this product with it&#x27;s slight citrus aroma.  (I tried another brand which had a horrible medicinal smell almost as if they had used chemicals in it).  The NOW Pure Frankincense oil is fabulous and the price on Amazon is fabulous too.</li>
    <li> The bottom-line for any essential oil is-does it work? The answer for NOW  1 oz. 100% Pure Frankincense Oil is-yes.</li>
    <li> The scent is strong yet subtle. I love the quality of this oil!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. and fast service</li>
    <li> Just as good of an oil as those expensive  distributors brands.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this frankincense essential oil.  The quality is excellent, and at a very reasonable price.  I have paid much more elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Noticed that somebody on here was saying that this isn&#x27;t really the 100% version, but I just got mine and it IS the 100% version, not the diluted version.</li>
    <li> Sent on time, gonna use it for soap making and health care. Wasnt sure of the smell at first, but its something to get used to.</li>
    <li> I use essential oils for my aromatherapy blends and have heard lots of good things about this brand. The oil is thick and it works really well.</li>
    <li> I received what I ordered, the 100% oil. Smells great, the only thing I was concerned with was that it seemed to be leaking out of the container when I took it out of the shipping bag, although the seal did not appear to be broken which was weird. It wasn&#x27;t dripping out, just smelled like it on the outside and my hands smelled like it after handling the unopened jar with a little stickiness. Doesn&#x27;t seem stale or old though so who knows.</li>
    <li> I have used Now essential oils for years and have been please by the quality and price.  Unfortunately, because of some (not all)  sellers, a number of consumers including myself did not get the product as advertised due to inaccurate pictures and / or descriptions.  Because I have used both the 20% and the100% versions of the product and returning the product was too much trouble i kept it.&lt;br /&gt;  Again, I feel the problem is not with the manufacturer as much as the sellers that  don&#x27;t know about the product they&#x27;re selling.  .</li>
    <li> Good frankincense oil.  Smells very different from the previous frankincense oil that I had, but smells more like the real frankincense that I am familiar with.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I love this stuff, use it almost daily in my diffuser. I just cant see paying crazy prices other companies charge for their oils.</li>
    <li> This should be indicated as a BLEND in the TITLE. Very little true frankincense aroma. It would be helpful to list ratio of blend in a more conspicuous place...</li>
    <li> It was 100% pure as described, quick shipping and good quality.</li>
    <li> I used it all up. So Good. A couple drops in the bath water.</li>
    <li> I love this and at an awesome price!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. It&#x27;s 100% real frankincense oil that you can use for your everyday needs. I like to use it in my diffuser with some other oils and just kick back and relax.</li>
    <li> After I put this on my hands and wait sbout 20 minutes, my hands smell like Church frankincense. Very good.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  It smells great and I  think it really does possess healing properties or at least pain relief.</li>
    <li> I was tempted to purchase Frankincense from a friend that sells oils through doterra. I found this and saw how much cheeper it is and thought I would give it a shot. It works just as well as the oil that is 10 X the price of this brand.</li>
    <li> Such a perfect full frankincense scent! I will be switching to NOW brand for this type of essential oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a friend who swears that it helps with wrinkles.  Well it did nothing for my wrinkles but I use it on my kids when they are wrestles and it helps them calm down and go to sleep at night.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product more than 5 times, and I can tell you that it is in fact 100% pure Frankincense oil.  I first started using a product that cost literally ten times per ounce more than the now food brand oil, and when I first found this product I was skeptical that it was the same.. I did a side by side comparison, texture, taste, smell, thickness...  in every way it appears to be identical to the other brand but way less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I started buying so much of this stuff is because my Dad is battling cancer and a health food store clerk mentioned that Frankincense oil is a good cancer fighter.  I started giving my Dad 30 drops daily(not all at once, spread out through the day) of pure Frankincense oil along with 1000mg of Laetrile, and although I don&#x27;t know if these substances actually destroy cancer, there is no question that within two weeks he was feeling far better because his pain had nearly vanished!  At one point he was loaded on morphine and oxycodone to the point of being in a \\&quot;zombie\\&quot; state, and now he has been completely off of all pain meds for over 3 months!  His type of cancer(tongue/throat) is extremely painful and he has gone many months now with no pain at all!  Almost every Doctor he has seen(which has been many), expresses amazement that he has no pain considering the advanced stage of cancer that he had(which may not be so advanced at this point.. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt compelled to write this review in hopes of helping someone else out there who may be in despair due to life debilitating pain. My Dad was at death&#x27;s door and in severe pain back in July, and the pain has long since fled and he is getting better week by week.  He has also been undergoing chemo and radiation therapy for several months but the pain had completely subsided before this process started).  The two biggest factors I credit for the pain vanishing are Laetrile and Frankincense oil, as it was obvious that within weeks after administering this to my Dad he started to \\&quot;come back to life\\&quot;.  Note:  I started both at the same time so I cannot tell you which one or if perhaps it&#x27;s the combination of both that has had this powerful effect.is to my Dad he started to \\&quot;come back to life\\&quot;.  Note:  I started both at the same time so I cannot tell you which one or if perhaps it&#x27;s the combination of both that has had this powerful effect.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a home made face and hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;Worked well, smell is nice.&lt;br /&gt;No problems with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love the NOW brand of essential oils. I use this twice daily, morning and night in a homemade wrinkle remover cream/concoction.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this seller.  They shipped a 20% concentration of the frankincense diluted in carrier oil, though the page I ordered clearly stated I was ordering 100% pure frankincense essential oil.  I contacted the seller immediately to discuss how we can rectify this error, but it&#x27;s been over a week and the seller has still not even bothered to reply to inquiry.  I&#x27;ve waited this long before submitting the review, simply to give the seller a chance to respond and resolve this problem.  Should the seller decide to do so, I will update my review at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed when reading some other reviews here that there was a similar story --  the seller substitutes the diluted product for the one they advertise as 100% concentration.  I want other potential buyers to be aware that based upon my experience you will not get what you pay for and this seller will not work with or communicate with you.  I will definitely not be recommending this product/seller to anyone.  If 0 stars were possible, that&#x27;s how I would rate them.  There is simply no excuse for customer service that poor.  There are so many other good sellers available on Amazon and this has truly been my first bad experience.  I would recommend that you keep looking for another source to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/10:  In good conscience I felt it necessary to update this review.  Within a couple of days after submitting the original review I received a notice from the vendor that they would refund my purchase.  They did exactly that and I could not have asked for anything more.  I appreciate their willingness to make things right and hassle-free and have therefore raised my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.  I left one star off for the inconvenience/issue, but the product received did seem to be of good quality for what it was and felt it correct to raise the rating based on the outcome of my situation.  I appreciate that this seller ultimately did the right thing to rectify the situationhe situation</li>
    <li> Very pleasant fragrance, strong but not overpowering. Seems to promote relaxation and helps to open stuffy nasal packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a measured opening that allows controlling the amount of oil dispensed. We have another oil in a bottle with no such opening and no dropper, and when we pour it out it goes everywhere, so the bottle is a big contributor to the five-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use the oil in an diffuser warmed by a small light bulb. A few drops of the frankincense oil will last through the night.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years. It is very strong even after diluting it . Its calming effects are great . The price is right , would be 5 stars if I could figure out how to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> Very good quality oil and ships fast.  I have seen this oil cost a lot of money so when I saw it I was not sure of the quality but It is great!</li>
    <li> Excellent, soothing scent, wonderful to drop few drops into a defuser, and you sleep like a princess. Grand scent bought more and will buy more.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No idea what true Frankincense should smell like, but this it the bomb! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I didn&#x27;t get ripped off!</li>
    <li> I just received my 1 oz bottle sold by NutriPlus Tea, fulfilled by Amazon and it is the 100% pure frankincense oil (Boswellia carterii), no carrier oil.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with frankincense and this is quite affordable. I use it everyday with oil warmer and mix it with a carrier oil for skin care. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use it, didn&#x27;t like it, returned it, it was pricy and not what I expected.  Also, The bottle leaked a little bit.</li>
    <li> Seems comparable to another oil that is much higher in price; it just doesn&#x27;t have as much of the citrus smell, which is something that important to me.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love the smell of this oil. This smells to me like a Russian Orthodox church, the smell of which I&#x27;ve never been a fan of. Too many negative associations, so not for me.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using it on my face but I have not seen any changes yet. i can&#x27;t really compare it to other pure frankincense oil since this is my first time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Frankincense essential oil before and received a great product from other brands. This one is essential oil mixed with grapeseed oil- even that would be OK if the scent were great, which it&#x27;s not. This product is produced from the bark of the tree rather than the resin- big difference. The scent isn&#x27;t bad- just more like cedar, and not much like Frankincense.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful. I don&#x27;t even light the tea candle under the diffuser anymore. the fragrance lasts a couple of days. better than frankincense oil I&#x27;ve bought from 2 other sources.</li>
    <li> The smell you smell in the bottle comes to true life once you put it on diffuser sticks.  Reminds you of the church.</li>
    <li> Great scent and good for general use.  I use a lot of oil for different things and these are great.</li>
    <li> Gentle on my skin smells really nice and very moisturizes well. Arrived on time, packaged very well to prevent accidents....will buy more.</li>
    <li> I bought it hearing and reading about the benefits of frankincense. I use it on small cuts, my face if I have a break out or rub it on my hands and body before I go outside. It&#x27;s a very earthy clovey type of smell. I&#x27;m more of a lavender and eucalyptus scent person. I will buy more but I think it will last me awhile since I don&#x27;t use it as much as my lavender and eucalyptus oils.I have tasted it but I&#x27;m not one for the taste of it.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews about how a lot of people bought the 100% Franckincense oil and got a 20% diluted version. I have amazon prime so I figured if I bought the 100% and they sent the 20% I would just send it back with free shipping. I am pleased to say that I received the product as described and it was in fact the 100%! I ordered from Healthy Nest, hope that helps.</li>
    <li> Good quality and potent essential oil and for a great price. I saw it somewhere else and it was $25 for 5 ml or something like that! This is good quality oil and it&#x27;s actually affordable.</li>
    <li> Another great oil from NOW.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and has a strong, but not over powering, aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Very please with this product.</li>
    <li> The photo and part of the description stated that this was 100% pure frankincense oil, but another part of the description said that it contained grapeseed oil.  All of the reviews that I saw that mentioned the purity stated that they received 100% pure frankicense oil.  Since I couldn&#x27;t find any other listings on Amazon for 100% oil, but there were other links for the 20% blended, I decided to go ahead and order it.  Well... I received the 20% frankincense version.  It still smells nice and I&#x27;ll use it, so it&#x27;s not worth the time or effort to return it, but I am dissapointed.  Amazon needs to do a better job matching photos/descriptions and reviews to the correct product.  If you choose to order this, know that Swanson&#x27;s sends out 20% oil for this item.  Maybe other suppliers are the real stuff.  I won&#x27;t be ordering this next time.</li>
    <li> Now Foods has 2 types of Frankincense oil. This one that is named: Pure Frankincense oil and an oil blend with Grape seed oil. The seller I bought from tried to give me the oil blend instead of the pure variety. I sent it back. Check Now Foods website and your order. Don&#x27;t pay for something you didn&#x27;t order.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my sister. Arrived on time and in&lt;br /&gt;perfect condition. The price was good compared to&lt;br /&gt;other brands that are smaller. The scent is ok, I had&lt;br /&gt;to get used to it. It is already blended with a carrier oil&lt;br /&gt;so it is ready to use. Will buy others oils from NOW.</li>
    <li> Really nice, earthy frankincense. The best I could find on AMZN</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful and valuable health tool.  I am pleased to have been able to purchase it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I would recommend for anyone looking for oils to use for relaxation. The oil helps to open the senses and creates a calming atmosphere.</li>
    <li> Now has the best oils out there. Just make sure when buying you get 100% essential oils. Love the scent in my products.</li>
    <li> The product description is blatantly misleading. The essential oil is not pure, but is diluted with a carrier oil. Works, but was not the quality I expected.</li>
