      <li>The smell is pleasant too.</li>
      <li>It smells really good too.  </li>
      <li>Or spend a lot of money on truly good brands like Kerastase and Oribe.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m in love with the Davines brand!</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
      <li>Try this Davines LOVE conditioner!  </li>
      <li>And I really love them!  </li>
      <li>Davines Conditioner seemed to work quite well and also has a nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>All in all, if you&#x27;re going to spend kind of a lot of money on conditioner, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is also really nice.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>tried the Davines Love shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;ve tried so many Davines products to date and loved them.  </li>
      <li>This is more effective when used as a hair mask for me.</li>
      <li>Honestly, something like Pantene is probably going to work better for the majority of people.</li>
      <li>I bought this product after reading about it in a fashion magazine, I also bought the shampoo which I really loved but the conditioner was nothing special and I will not buy it again</li>
      <li>It makes my hair very smooth.  </li>
      <li>Better to just buy Pantene and save your money.  </li>
      <li>Best conditioner ever for coarse hair!</li>
      <li>I do a much better job than she can do.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.  </li>
      <li>However, after switching out my shampoo (the Davines Love Smoothing Shampoo) to a different brand, I found that the conditioner worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>My hair is curly and frizzy and after I use Davines Love, the curl stays and the frizz is gone.  </li>
      <li>I love all their products that I&#x27;ve tried and receive many compliments on the healthy condition of my hair.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>This was recommended to me by my stylist, and I&#x27;m glad she brought it to my attention.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this before and packaging was better.</li>
      <li>If you want smooth silky hair, this product is for you!</li>
      <li>also love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>also don&#x27;t love the scent, but its not terrible.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely refreshing, makes hair feel like silk.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is really cute though.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is more like a hair lotion.</li>
      <li>I love Love.</li>
      <li>I promise you get what you paid for if you can get away from using it like you&#x27;ve been using the cheap stuff!</li>
      <li>My wife and daughter love using this.</li>
      <li>Ok, so...&lt;br /&gt;First of all, if you don&#x27;t care for parabens etc.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This Love stuff is going in the trash.</li>
      <li>That said, I give the advantage to the Oi shampoo and conditioner because I find it to be even more hydrating, which my extra-dry hair needs.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite conditioner of all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to be a huge fan for years to come :)</li>
      <li>Other than that this conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>In fact, I never come out of the shower with tangles when I use this conditioner, and can easily run my finger through to get any lingering tangle out.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pretty nice too.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that gets weighed down easily - this conditioner is perfect.</li>
      <li>Hands down, the Davines line is the best hair care system I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Still, I think it is a really great set and much more hydrating than most other shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried and am giving it five stars for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This makes the perfect combination for tangles and this conditioner gets rid of them instantly and smells incredible---a clean, fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair but lots of it</li>
      <li>No greasy residue afterword and easy tangle free hair upon washout.</li>
      <li>it leaves my hair and leans in often for a quick sniff. :)</li>
      <li>And then I style with the Deva Curl Styling Cream and Deva Curl light defining gel.  </li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and leaves your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>This is an great daily conditioner.</li>
      <li>I use several products from Davines, the line is great.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>The Davinies line is always gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>I like the way it smells, very fresh.  </li>
      <li>The price doesn&#x27;t break the bank, as many of the higher end products tend to do, and the quality of my hair has improved drastically.  </li>
      <li>Its worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It is rich, creamy and does wonders for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this conditioner with its matching shampoo for a year now. My hair has never felt so soft and sleek...plus, they both smell amazing!  Although the products are pricey, they&#x27;re totally worth it if you enjoy having soft, healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this due to all the positive reviews and it definitely did make my hair soft and made blowing it out really easy my favorites are usually Lanza products however I think this is a really good conditioner if used right meaning, not too much needed at all and rinse out well, and if u blow dry ur hair a lot invest in a professional grade hairdryer it makes a complete difference! Over all this is definitely going to be a conditioner I use a lot in the future!! If it helps I have bra stap length hair it is thin but I have a lot&lt;br /&gt;Of it and a lot of highlights so a good conditoner is a must for me!!</li>
    <li> Pairs perfectly with it&#x27;s coordinating shampoo! Beats all other professional products such as Redken, Purology, etc. Using both I am able to straighten my hair like no other in record time and the frizz is all gone!</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and live in TX so this helps reduce friz and keeps my hair soft with luscious curls. I&#x27;m in love with the Davines brand!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I don&#x27;t know if it does better than anything else at smoothing my hair, but it&#x27;s not too heavy or too light. The smell is great, a bit like tomato plants, but subtle. A lot of people don&#x27;t like that Davines conditioners come in tubs, but they tend to be pretty thick, so it&#x27;s kind of necessary. The thickness also means that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it, so one tub lasts me a while.</li>
    <li> I have curly, naturally dry, color-processed hair - and this is the only product that makes it silky smooth.  I used to buy it at my local boutique hair salon, but they stopped carrying it so here i am.  I&#x27;ll continue to be a huge fan for years to come :)</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I have fine hair but lots of it and it is colored. This makes the perfect combination for tangles and this conditioner gets rid of them instantly and smells incredible---a clean, fresh scent. I definitely reccommend it.</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy thick poofy wild cave woman hair, like I do, this is the only stuff that&#x27;s gonna work. Hands down. I&#x27;ve tried everything. The smell is pleasant too.</li>
    <li> The Davines line is more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than other hair products, but overall I was not really overly impressed by this conditioner. I have my hair colored so it was recommended to me by my colorist. It&#x27;s gentle, but not worth the expense. Of course, it works better than conditioners you&#x27;d find at regular drug stores. I prefer Kerastase Chroma Reflect and Chroma Riche products......expensive but they will make your hair shine like Demi Moore&#x27;s beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, look no further.  It took me 40 years to find the perfect product.  My Curly Hair specialist turned me on to it and I swear by it.  I use Loma Moisturizing Shampoo, then Jellua Squid Ink Repair Treatment as step 2, then put just a tiny bit of the Love Conditioner in.  After rinsing all, I then apply Loma Curl Cream while sopping wet, then separate out and define some curls while sopping wet and let it air dry.  Do not put a towel on your head, it frizzes and separates hair into thin, messy curls. If you air dry really wet curls, they dry shinier and more controlled. After almost dry, I finish off with low heat, low air hair drier just to control any odd pieces and frizzies.</li>
    <li> Combined with the shampoo, it makes a huge difference in my extremely frizzy hair.  Will buy it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m known for trying new hair products constantly. I have finally found my winning combination. Davines Love Shampoo and Conditioner paired with my Sedu straight iron. My hair is finally the hair I have always wanted. I have curly, usually frizzy hair but I wear it straight. These products are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product a few years ago and I just got around to checking it out and am so glad I finally did! It smells great, and my hair was still soft after walking a mile to the train in the bitter Chicago wind...definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something to tame your frizz and make processed hair look and feel better immediately.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair product that ever tamed my coarse, thick and wavy hair.  It definitely keeps the unwanted volume down and the scent is fresh and light!  I have been using regularly for several years andI could no longer get from my stylist. Great relief to see on Amazon I am very satisfied overall and hope to purchase again (Seems like Davine&#x27;s may be changing the formula).</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m 29 yrs old and have tried a lot of conditioners on my frizzy curls.  this is the best i&#x27;ve ever found.  it really helps to define my curls and they feel much softer.  i still have some frizz so i give it 4 stars instead of 5-- but i highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this conditioner made my naturally long thick hair look too flat. However, after switching out my shampoo (the Davines Love Smoothing Shampoo) to a different brand, I found that the conditioner worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> came full,  no variances from what I had purchased previously at the salon!</li>
    <li> Great product, Really helps dry hair become manageable!</li>
    <li> My hair was really dry and this is an everyday conditioner that does the trick! Thank you davines LOVE conditioner!!</li>
    <li> If you want smooth silky hair, this product is for you! You don&#x27;t need a lot, but it moisturizes and leaves hair feeling great! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is an great daily conditioner. Not too heavy, nice fragrance that lingers slightly during the day. Have been using for just over a year and always getting compliments on my hair.  A bit more expensive than other brands but worth it.</li>
    <li> I think this conditioner is just terrific. I have pretty frizzy curls, and this conditioner leaves your hair feeling very sleek and smooth, and makes it so much easier to flat iron - highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as described.  It makes my hair very smooth.  I am giving it 4 stars because I&#x27;m not wild about the smell... It is so conditioning that you only have to use a small quarter sized amt. for great results!  I would recommend it to anyone with hair that tends to get &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; and frizzy with humidity... great purchase...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it claims. I have dry frizzy hair &amp; it still looks dry &amp; frizzy after I use it. Don&#x27;t like the smell but that&#x27;s personal.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the Davines line is the best hair care system I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve tried to wean myself to more natural products over the years, and while there have been hits or misses, the more organic lines don&#x27;e provide the level of clean that I look for.  My new hairstylist introduced me to Davines, and I&#x27;ve bee in heaven since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Love conditioner smells absolutely divine - it has that elusive &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent that I have searched high and low for. The price doesn&#x27;t break the bank, as many of the higher end products tend to do, and the quality of my hair has improved drastically.  Paired with the Melu Shampoo and the OI All in One Milk, my hair is back to the same texture and softness I had as a teenager more than 25 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m done looking for a new line. For me, Davines is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter as she has short hair &amp; I use the green version for long hair.  They both work great</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, it does exactly what it says controls and conditions hair.  It smells fabulous all day long as well!</li>
    <li> I use several products from Davines, the line is great. I switch around within their product line depending on whether my hair needs more or less moisture/ conditioning treatment, and depending on the outdoor weather conditions - i.e. humidity, rain, dry air etc...I love all their products that I&#x27;ve tried and receive many compliments on the healthy condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> Wow- I am surprised people have positive reviews..I have very curly hair that tangles easily. I try every product at least once in search of the great conditioning my hair needs. I usually use L&#x27;Anza products, or just Loreal Sulphate Free products if I am short on cash, and each work very good for me. I wanted to try something different. This conditioner is more like a hair lotion. It did not detangle my hair at all. The packaging is horrible. Here&#x27;s my experience: My hands are wet in the shower, and I have to struggle to pull off the lid, scoop out a glop of this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; and then put on my hair with one hand, before placing the lid back on and back on the shelf before massaging through my hair. If the product worked well, it would be worth it, but this conditioner is awful and not even worth half the price.</li>
    <li> I do my wife a favor and wash her hair for her in the kitchen sink.  I do a much better job than she can do.  She has me order her shampoo and conditioner.  i get it from Amazon which I do with a lot of other products.  She raves about this conditioner.</li>
    <li> My stylist had been using this conditioner with the matching shampoo on me whenever I went to the salon but the markup was so high that it prevented me from purchasing it.  Alas, I found it on Amazon.  While still expensive, it is worth every penny.  A little goes a long ways.  Earth-friendly packaging and of course, not animal-tested.  Shipping with Prime was a little slow due to a holiday weekend .</li>
    <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner.  You don&#x27;t need a lot to run through your hair, so it should last longer than most other products.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in #LOVE with Davines shampoo and conditioner. It smells fantastic and leaves your hair smooth and shiny. Brilliant product!</li>
    <li> Everything I&#x27;ve tried from this brand is just pointless.  Better to just buy Pantene and save your money.  Or spend a lot of money on truly good brands like Kerastase and Oribe.</li>
    <li> Instant smooth and shine. I love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely refreshing, makes hair feel like silk.  Love it.  I also use the shampoo and  oil when my hair is dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Besides the yummy citrus smell, you need such a little amount to get the job done. No greasy residue afterword and easy tangle free hair upon washout. I definitely recommend the conditioner. I love it.</li>
    <li> This left my hair feeling icky at first, then crunchy.  I will not be using this product in the future. I essentially threw my money away. However, it did hold a curl, but I think it did about as good as mousse would...</li>
    <li> Ok, so...&lt;br /&gt;First of all, if you don&#x27;t care for parabens etc., this is not the conditioner for you. This has got all the parabens, dyes, etc. I listed the ingredients as they are written on my container at the bottom of this review since i&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re ordered the same on the description on this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have boob-length hair which is fine, but there&#x27;s a ton of it, and it tends to get wavy, dry, and  frizzy. When I use this an as ordinary conditioner, this makes my hair... fluffy. There&#x27;s really no other word for it. The smell is &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; but not distinct or really noticeable. This is more effective when used as a hair mask for me. I slather it on and leave it for half an hour or so, and my hair is much softer and shiner afterwards (but with an inclination towards oiliness after a few hours). However, this is going to be the case for pretty much any normal conditioner that you leave on. Honestly, something like Pantene is probably going to work better for the majority of people. If you&#x27;re going for higher-end and great-smelling, I&#x27;d suggest Aesop. The packaging is really cute though. All in all, if you&#x27;re going to spend kind of a lot of money on conditioner, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this. There are many other better options out there for the same price, or much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients as listed on my container:&lt;br /&gt;Water, cetearyl alchohol, behentrimonium chloride, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, cetrimonium chloride, phenoxyethanol, hydrogenated polydecene,borage extract, rice bran wax, amodimethicone, panthenol, polyquaterinim-10, hydrogenated palm glycerides citrate, tocopherol, benzophenone-4, popylene glycol, trideceth-12, sunflower seed oil, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, disodium edta, potassium sorbate, citric acid, ci 14700/red 4, blue 1, fragrance.</li>
    <li> It has made my hair so much healthier with just a few uses.  I like the way it smells, very fresh.  I will update once i&#x27;ve used up the container.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have tried yet! It really makes my hair soft smooth and bouncy.  I have long wavy,sometimes frizzy hair that is thin. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, yet it is very conditioning.  It smells really good too.  I love Love. The shampoo is great too.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so soft and shiny. You can tell the quality just by putting a little in your hand- it&#x27;s super thick and luxurious feeling. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell and while it made my hair soft and manageable, it also made it more dull.</li>
    <li> Best hair conditioner on the market for dry, worn out, tired or CURLY hair.  This stuff is superb and a little goes a long way.  Still, I wish it came in a bigger container.</li>
    <li> For context, I have thick, shoulder length hair.  It is highlighted blonde, somewhat coarse, and naturally wavy.  For me, my biggest hair issue is keeping it soft and shiny, especially since I regularly heat style and highlight my hair.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried all manners of shampoo from affordable drug store brands to a variety of salon brands.  For awhile I wasn&#x27;t convinced salon brands were really worth the money until I found the exact products that worked for me, cut back on how often I washed and heat styled my hair, and had my hair cut more often.  I say that because based on my experience, no one thing is a miracle cure and it wasn&#x27;t until I did all these things that I&#x27;ve had the softest, healthiest hair I&#x27;ve ever had in my entire life.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it is flawless or that I don&#x27;t have bad hair days (I do!), it just is noticeably healthier than it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my general regime. On the days I wear my hair straight, I shampoo &amp; condition with either Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Blonde Angel products (to help my hair from becoming too brassy) or Davines Oi products.  Then I style with a combination of Davines This is a Relaxing Moisturizing Fluid and OI/Absolute Beautifying Potion while using my hair dryer and flat iron.  On the days I wear my hair curly, I use Deva Curl No Poo and Deva Curl One Condition to clean and condition my hair.  And then I style with the Deva Curl Styling Cream and Deva Curl light defining gel.  Yes, it&#x27;s a lot of products but it&#x27;s what works well for me and many of them I use so little of (especially the styling products) that they last me a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Davines Love shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;ve tried so many Davines products to date and loved them.  I was curious to see how these would compare to the others I&#x27;ve tried.  And I really love them!  They are quite moisturizing and using them in conduction with the aforementioned Davines styling products, my hair looked very healthy and smooth and styled easily.  It also has a slight grapefruit-like smell that smelled really fresh and appealing.  That said, I give the advantage to the Oi shampoo and conditioner because I find it to be even more hydrating, which my extra-dry hair needs.  However, if your hair is less prone to dryness and less problematic than mine, you might fine this to be sufficient.  Still, I think it is a really great set and much more hydrating than most other shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried and am giving it five stars for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately though, I think it comes down to what your individual needs.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is a little bit different and we all have different preferences when it comes to styling so for me there was no substitute for experimenting and figuring out what worked with my unique hair needs.</li>
    <li> I used this in 2008-09, when my hair was in bad shape, and I loved this conditioner.  Then switched to a different shampoo and conditioner.  Over the last few years, I&#x27;ve taken better care of my hair and it&#x27;s much shinier and healthier, so I decided to treat myself with this conditioner again.  Big mistake.  The conditioner still smells great, but it literally makes my hair feel like straw.  I used this for a few weeks, but couldn&#x27;t take how awful it made my hair.  So I switched back to my old conditioner, and my hair has made a great comeback.  This Love stuff is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> My salon recommended this for my hair and it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done. I have thick blonde hair and it had been so damaged for years and I had to keep cutting it and when I changed to this product my hair has reached full potential again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer- yes the bottles are smaller than your old shampoo store bought brands but it&#x27;s completely concentrated! It&#x27;s lasted me longer than old brands. When using the conditioner only apply to the &amp;#34;pony tail&amp;#34; of your hair and DONT scoop just dip three fingers in and it&#x27;s plenty of product! Also with shampoo only use a quarter size and apply to the scalp of hair! Massage and rinse a little and keep massaging then rinse completely! If you&#x27;re not using like this that&#x27;s the ONLY reason your hair would feel weighed down or stringy! I promise you get what you paid for if you can get away from using it like you&#x27;ve been using the cheap stuff! The conditioner has lasted me 16 weeks and the shampoo has lasted me 8 which has never worked out that way in the past! It&#x27;s great. I promise!</li>
    <li> Complete misleading PUT UP A PICTURE of a much larger product but actually sent a travel size extremely smaller sized product VERY MISLEADING</li>
    <li> The Davines line is my favorite!!  I do alternate with other brands like Alterna Caviar, but those seem to strip my hair a bit, too strong perhaps.  The Davinies line is always gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> You have to get use to the smell and the container makes it hard to get the product out.  Other than that this conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my daughter&#x27;s thick, curly hair.  It really helps tame the frizz.  She&#x27;s very happy with it!</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner, so smoothing!  When washing out my hair seriously feels like silk.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  My hair is curly and frizzy and after I use Davines Love, the curl stays and the frizz is gone.  It was recommended to me by my stylist and I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.  I use it every time I wash my hair now, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever for coarse hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading about it in a fashion magazine, I also bought the shampoo which I really loved but the conditioner was nothing special and I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love using this. .I reorder it every time they run out!  I recommend this product! Its worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth.  Yummy!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that gets weighed down easily - this conditioner is perfect. I use it every day and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> First product I&#x27;ve found that will tame my frizzy hair. It makes my hair so manageable and doesn&#x27;t blow up in humid weather~Follow the directions!</li>
    <li> love: can use very little and it really smoothes my hair, which is naturally curly and has a combination of natural gray and died textures. it does this without leaving residue on anything post shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love less: why not fill the tub a little more? I mean for the price and bother of shipping, it would make sense. also don&#x27;t love the scent, but its not terrible.</li>
    <li> Davines Conditioner seemed to work quite well and also has a nice fragrance.  I believe there are other products which are less expensive and you will receive the same results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!! It gets all my tangles out and makes my hair really soft! A tiny bit goes a really long way</li>
    <li> I have tried this conditioner before, and it is perfect.  It&#x27;s the ultimate deep conditioning treatment especially if you have any kind of damaging from bleach products or a perm.  This conditioner is worth it&#x27;s price.  I give it a 3 rating because I was very disappointed in the packaging prior to shipping the product, it arrived cracked and half of the conditioner had leaked out, not only that but now that the container is cracked, the top layer of conditioner keeps drying out since I only use it once a week causing even more waste of a good thing.  Try this Davines LOVE conditioner!  But possibly rethink where you buy it from.</li>
    <li> Provides softness I haven&#x27;t had from other products.</li>
    <li> This makes my pubes soft, holy hell. and I guess it makes my 1/4 inch buzz cut soft too. must purchase if you girls like ur men with soft pubes.</li>
    <li> I started using this conditioner a few years ago and then my hair salon dropped it. Great product! Hate that I have to order it online!</li>
    <li> I have super thin hair and often these thick conditioners leave my hair heavy and greasy feeling, but I use this one constantly and it makes my hair so smooth and soft without weighing it down. I also blow dry my hair constantly and feel this does enough to moisturize. Good buy.</li>
    <li> this is my special occasion conditioner. when my super curly hair needs to be straightened in this rainy seattle weather. good buy but very expensive and doesn&#x27;t smell good. a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I have coarse, wavy hair and wanted a conditioner to calm it down.  This product is just OK - doesn&#x27;t really condition my hair to the level I would have expected.  Try a different kind if this is what you need.  The \\&quot;green conditioner\\&quot; product by Davines works better for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Because of the packaging, at first I found myself using way more product than I needed to, but quickly learned that a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve got long, chemically treated blonde hair and after using this conditioner, my hair is the softest it&#x27;s been since before I started attacking it with heat and dye. It smells great, and my hair has body and shine, but the softness is the thing that impresses me the most. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!</li>
    <li> I had just gotten slicing low and high lights and my hair was very dry.  It definitely added silkiness and smoothness and shine to my hair.  It is thick so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use every time you wash your hair (maybe every other time) b/c if you also you styling products it tends to weigh your hair down a little (which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars).  But I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner of all. Hands down.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it smells divine. It is rich, creamy and does wonders for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine colored treated brown hair and it moisturizes like no other. And as rich as it is, it does not leave a greasy residue. On the contrary my hair is super soft and light.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have for dry hair.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my stylist, and I&#x27;m glad she brought it to my attention. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, and it makes my hair feel better than ever. The smell is not overwhelming to me, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or tangled. In fact, I never come out of the shower with tangles when I use this conditioner, and can easily run my finger through to get any lingering tangle out. That&#x27;s not the case with the other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s a reason this dries out your hair: it&#x27;s got sodium!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that shampoo and conditioner at such high costs will include ingredients that don&#x27;t work with hair.&lt;br /&gt;I threw it away... away from my hair. $ gone down the drain, and dry hair!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
    <li> GREAT conditioner. It&#x27;s thick but it&#x27;s not something that is so heavy and greasy that weighs your hair down (YMMV.... I do have coarser hair). The fragrance is pretty nice too.</li>
    <li> Nice product. It is a little pricey however you only need a little each time you use it.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner but this packaging is terrible.  The top doesn&#x27;t stay on and I&#x27;m so worried someone may drop it or pick it up the wrong way and it will spill.  I&#x27;ve bought this before and packaging was better.</li>
    <li> I have using this product for over 2 years now and I would not use anything else.... I live in florida and the humidity is HELL down here.  Davines helps to tame the frizzies and keeps my hair smooth....</li>
    <li> It has done wonders for my hair.  It keeps dry-ness and fizziness at bay. The scent is perfectly calming/soothing. My significant other loves how clean and fresh smelling it leaves my hair and leans in often for a quick sniff. :)</li>
    <li> Having thick, coarse, wavy to curly hair that frizzes, this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used because it leaves my hair soft. However, I need to use further styling serums to battle frizz as no conditioner alone does that for me. I let my hair dry naturally. Was introduced to this at a salon that uses it routinely. Have tried to find cheaper substitutes but nothing works quite like it. The shampoo is also really nice.</li>
    <li> Conditioner smells great and does make hair very smooth, I have medium length hair and it has lasted me 3 months, you only have to use a small amount</li>
