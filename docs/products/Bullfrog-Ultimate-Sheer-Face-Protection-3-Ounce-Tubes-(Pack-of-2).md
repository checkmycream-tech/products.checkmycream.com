      <li>I kiteboard a lot and needed a good product.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the texture and lack of oiliness was good.</li>
      <li>Bullfrog Face is a good comprise, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Works great and smells even better</li>
      <li>This Bullfrog \\&quot;Face\\&quot; is non greasy on my face and seems like a nice product.</li>
      <li>Nice scent.</li>
      <li>- Good price &amp; easy to find at drugstores, etc.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and is easy to on, not sticky like some lotions are.  </li>
      <li>Its not my favorite</li>
      <li>I bought this as it was one of the safe sunblocks according to that one environmental website.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than what I find at the drug store.</li>
      <li>It is sunscreen, and I think it is simply the very best that you can use on your face.</li>
      <li>It is light, non-greasy, does not make your face shiney, goes on like a dream, and most importantly protects your face.</li>
      <li>- Goes on light and invisible.</li>
      <li>I tried every \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen product available.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years and found that it doesn&#x27;t wear off too fast, even with vigorous exercise and it feels very light on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Also,it&#x27;s wonderfully waterproof,but, unlike other products, washes off easily and completely with soap and water.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in full sun all day.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen smells way too floral and sweet.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll use it since its safer than the other sunblocks out there for a great price.</li>
      <li>It not only contains the safest of the chemical sunscreens (NO Oxybenzone) but also contains many natural botanicals making it a wonderful substitute for your daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>After reading the multitude of reviews we tried this on a recent trip to Costa Rica and it worked very well on both adults and fair skinned pre-teens.</li>
      <li>I like how it really works.  </li>
      <li>I was in Florida this winter and was on the beach for the whole day</li>
      <li>While the others in my group ended the day with bright red noses and cheeks, mine did not even have a hint of pink!!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommed it.</li>
      <li>Got as a sunscreen that will cause the least amount of pore clogging possible and give good (all day, under makeup) sun protection.  </li>
      <li>Its not bad, but just feels like a basic drugstore brand sunscreen with the generic sunscreen smell.  </li>
      <li>- Smells natural (like aloe vera or a leaf)  </li>
      <li>This is the only sunscreen I really like.</li>
      <li>Spent a week in the Islands and never got too much sun on my face.</li>
      <li>The danger, apparently, is that a lot of commercial suncreams contain chemicals which could cause skin cancer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I agree with the review that says your search for the perfect sunscreen is over. Pros:  - Has antioxidant!  - Goes on light and invisible. No white cast. I use this under my makeup.  - Smells natural (like aloe vera or a leaf)  - Good price &amp; easy to find at drugstores, etc.  Cons: none that I can think of.</li>
    <li> Got as a sunscreen that will cause the least amount of pore clogging possible and give good (all day, under makeup) sun protection.  Works great and smells even better (doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen).</li>
    <li> ....this is the perfect sunscreen for your face.  It is light, non-greasy, does not make your face shiney, goes on like a dream, and most importantly protects your face. I attended a college football game this weekend and sat in seats that had the sun beating directly into my face.  While the others in my group ended the day with bright red noses and cheeks, mine did not even have a hint of pink!!  Besides protection, I am also concerned about the safety of the ingredients of products.  I tried every \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen product available. Not only were they cosmetically unacceptable, my face would breakout horribly. Bullfrog Face is a good comprise, in my opinion. It not only contains the safest of the chemical sunscreens (NO Oxybenzone) but also contains many natural botanicals making it a wonderful substitute for your daily moisturizer. Also,it&#x27;s wonderfully waterproof,but, unlike other products, washes off easily and completely with soap and water. Order this...you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> This is great for runners! I like the smell and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I sweat. And it works!</li>
    <li> Goes on every morning before work in the summer months. It is close to invisible; unlike zinc oxide products does not make me look pallid.</li>
    <li> Great for the face as it does not burn around my eyes. Nice scent.</li>
    <li> Hoped for something to help my fair skinned soccer player.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than what I find at the drug store.</li>
    <li> It is sunscreen, and I think it is simply the very best that you can use on your face. It never feels like your pores are sealed off or that your face is being coated in plastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a boat captain in the Florida Keys and recently got a job on a boat with no top. I&#x27;m in full sun all day. Couldn&#x27;t find my usual sun block so I tried this one. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used at protecting my fair skin.</li>
    <li> I hate greasy sunblock with a passion. This Bullfrog \\&quot;Face\\&quot; is non greasy on my face and seems like a nice product. I am not sure how waterproof it is and will report back after being at the beach in July.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of bull frog. This is the only sunscreen I really like. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This sun cream is recommended by the EWG, the Environmental Working Group as being one of the few non-toxic creams out there. The danger, apparently, is that a lot of commercial suncreams contain chemicals which could cause skin cancer. Be careful!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, not greasy and protects you from the sun. I kiteboard a lot and needed a good product. Bullfrog works great. I highly recommed it.</li>
    <li> I like how it really works.  It smells good and is easy to on, not sticky like some lotions are.  I was in Florida this winter and was on the beach for the whole day and I didn&#x27;t get burned.  I used it all over, not just on my face and it works.</li>
    <li> it has no fragrance--perfect. and it&#x27;s doing the job that I wanted.  it&#x27;s sunscreen. not much to say.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. Spent a week in the Islands and never got too much sun on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this as it was one of the safe sunblocks according to that one environmental website.  Its not bad, but just feels like a basic drugstore brand sunscreen with the generic sunscreen smell.  Its not my favorite but I&#x27;ll use it since its safer than the other sunblocks out there for a great price.</li>
    <li> Great  product&#x3D;hard to find product. Every other sunscreen (even high priced cosmetic ones) irritates my face sooo badly. This product is functional and does NOT irritate my skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and found that it doesn&#x27;t wear off too fast, even with vigorous exercise and it feels very light on my skin.  I have never had trouble with it causing break-outs or rashes, and I am unable to use most other sunscreens on my face.</li>
    <li> After reading the multitude of reviews we tried this on a recent trip to Costa Rica and it worked very well on both adults and fair skinned pre-teens. The products didn&#x27;t irritate eyes or seem to drip during outdoor activities including surfing. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen smells way too floral and sweet.  I literally couldn&#x27;t stand to have it on.  Otherwise, the texture and lack of oiliness was good.</li>
