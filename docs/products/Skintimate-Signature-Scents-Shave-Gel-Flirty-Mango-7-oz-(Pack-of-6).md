### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE ITEM!!!!</li>
      <li>She says it is perfect!</li>
      <li>Great scent but is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>and it lathers great.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t stop raving about this product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Skintimate&#x27;s quite good, but if you&#x27;re wondering if it&#x27;ll be as good with your Venus razor as SatinCare</li>
      <li>Nice smell &amp; great product</li>
      <li>I like the texture of the product and the smell is good too.</li>
      <li>Skintimate shave gel is a perfectly adequate product; it&#x27;s just not the best for Venus razors, IMHO, just in case you were wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More like wastings!</li>
      <li>is really nice</li>
      <li>It is a shame, because I really liked the scent and the consistency and quality of the shaving gel.</li>
      <li>But as the fragrance of this shave gel is still pleasant, it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference to me.</li>
      <li>for the Flirty Mango fragrance, it&#x27;s pleasant and sweet, but it doesn&#x27;t smell ANYTHING like mango.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;d noticed that the SatinCare product information specified that that shave gel was formulated for use with Venus razors, that was what I had used for many months, until I ran out of SatinCare, and picked up a three pack of this scent of Skintimate</li>
      <li>And being a woman I am sure she would know.</li>
      <li>The women love how our legs feel.</li>
      <li>In my experience, 9 out of 10 products that claim to smell/taste like mango don&#x27;t - more like a blend of peach and apricot, as is the case once again here.</li>
      <li>goal is to provide a thorough review to assist others with their purchase, as there are many choices on Amazon</li>
      <li>The six cans I had before were way better.</li>
      <li>You could tell the can was still very full, but it would not come out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Skintimate is a perfectly fine shave gel, but for whatever reason, it gives me neither as close a shave nor as silky skin post-shave as SatinCare does.</li>
      <li>My husband and son says their faces never felt so smooth and no razor burns.  </li>
      <li>but this was worth it!</li>
      <li>I love, love, LOVE Venus razors since I started using them last year.</li>
      <li>I was excited to order this through subscribe and save every 3 months.  </li>
      <li>raw.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good, solid product and the mango smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to throw away 2 almost full cans because the lever quit working to squirt the gel out.</li>
      <li>Amazon did a good job providing a refund for this purchase as they were obviously a messed up lot of cans.  </li>
      <li>If you want a great scented shave gel, then you would have a hard time finding anything better then this.</li>
      <li>I ordered  a set of these and NONE of them dispensed right.  </li>
      <li>What new mom doesn&#x27;t want to shave and feel fresh and clean after 10 months of being pregnant?</li>
      <li>The first 3 cans I opened don&#x27;t dispense shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Most of which I was only able to pump several times before it stopped working.</li>
      <li>and I personally rely on reviews when making most of my purchases.  </li>
      <li>So much for savings!</li>
      <li>about halfway through the first can the pump stopped working.  </li>
      <li>First one worked and by the time I realized</li>
      <li>So far I have opened 5 of the 6 cans and 3 of the 5 did not work and had to be thrown out completely full.</li>
      <li>Our whole family uses this product both the men and the women.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for nothing</li>
      <li>Perhaps Gillette adds a specific ingredient that creates a silkier finish when SatinCare is used with their Venus razors; I&#x27;m thinking that that&#x27;s what it must be, because once I&#x27;ve finished my daily shave session with both SatinCare AND my Venus razor, my skin feels super smooth and very, very silky.</li>
      <li>Not a single canister was able to be used entirely before the expellant ran out.</li>
      <li>The last canister only allowed one use before it, too, refused to dispense any more product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other shave gels but none of them allow the blade to glide so easily off the skin</li>
      <li>So far three of the bottles in this package have not worked!  </li>
      <li>I normally love this product, but one can only let me dispense half the can</li>
      <li>My favourite gel so far</li>
      <li>So far 4 cans , I have tried and will not work.</li>
      <li>I only got about 1/2 can worth of shaving gel out of the total 6 cans!!  </li>
      <li>However, I have at least four cans here that are more than half full because they stopped spraying.  </li>
      <li>I bought these online because I just had a baby via csection a few days prior and couldn&#x27;t physically go to the store and buy more.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate enough to grow up in the Caribbean surrounded by the intoxicating, summery smell of mangoes ripening on the tree, and there are few fragrances or flavors like that of a ripe mango.</li>
      <li>So far 4 out of 6 cans have not dispensed properly and I&#x27;ve had to throw them away.  </li>
      <li>As the other reviewers said, I was only able to dispense a little bit of the can.  </li>

<li> Each can seems to last a while longer than other shave brands.</li>
<li> Very frustrating when you&#x27;re wet in the shower, ready to shave, and you have to yell for your hubby to please come grab a new can of shave gel for you.  </li>
<li> Every single can would not work.</li>
<li> Every single can in this pack was defective.</li>
<li> Every single one stopped working halfway through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> You can tell they are full, but something is wrong with the way the dispenser works.  </li>
<li> They would only dispense about half the can, if that, and then stop.  </li>
<li> SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t have to drag her out and about yet.</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t make your skin rough or</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried the others yet as I was too frustrated and thought what lite time I had would be better used to write this review than see if other cans defective also.</li>
<li> I have reordered the other scent.</li>
<li> This one stopped working about 1/4 way down.  </li>
<li> I wish it came with less bottles with subscribe and save because can&#x27;t seem to go through 6 in 6 months.</li>
<li> Three of the cans ran out air before half of the product was gone.</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> This was a waste of money, and will never be purchased again for this household.</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> and the other five failed to dispense even once.</li>
<li> The others ran very slow.</li>
<li> The entire box is useless!!</li>
<li> Very frustrated especially since Amazon won&#x27;t let me return the cans b/c</li>

<li> and I was unable to use because it lost its ability to pump out</li>
<li> I read the reviews and hoped they were wrong.  </li>
<li> Very frustrating.</li>
<li> SO DISAPPOINTED and what a waste!!</li>
<li> I could never get a close shave without cutting my skin</li>

<li> I am very disappointed with the quality of this product.  </li>
<li> I have used Skintimate for years and I am very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great scent but is not overpowering.  Each can seems to last a while longer than other shave brands.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need a lot of the product.  When you dispense, it comes out like soap, but as soon as you start to rub into legs or whatever body part you are going to shave, it foams up.  So, it fools you into thinking you have to dispense a lot.  And for some reason after I&#x27;m done using it, it still leaks out.  All 6 cans did this, so I&#x27;m going back to shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of the product and the smell is good too. My favourite gel so far</li>
    <li> I bought this pack of shave gel and none of the cans would dispense the gel. Very frustrated especially since Amazon won&#x27;t let me return the cans b/c they are \\&quot;flammable.\\&quot; I&#x27;d like my money back.</li>
    <li> Nice smell &amp; great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shave gels but none of them allow the blade to glide so easily off the skin and it doesn&#x27;t make your skin rough or raw.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good, solid product and the mango smell is really nice</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE Venus razors since I started using them last year. Since I&#x27;d noticed that the SatinCare product information specified that that shave gel was formulated for use with Venus razors, that was what I had used for many months, until I ran out of SatinCare, and picked up a three pack of this scent of Skintimate shave gel at my local price club. If I could return the Skintimate, I would, but I can&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll use what remains, and return to SatinCare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skintimate is a perfectly fine shave gel, but for whatever reason, it gives me neither as close a shave nor as silky skin post-shave as SatinCare does. Perhaps Gillette adds a specific ingredient that creates a silkier finish when SatinCare is used with their Venus razors; I&#x27;m thinking that that&#x27;s what it must be, because once I&#x27;ve finished my daily shave session with both SatinCare AND my Venus razor, my skin feels super smooth and very, very silky. I miss that, because I&#x27;m not getting it with Skintimate&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Skintimate for years, back during my college days, but in my case, that long preceded the creation of Venus razors. Skintimate shave gel is a perfectly adequate product; it&#x27;s just not the best for Venus razors, IMHO, just in case you were wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Flirty Mango fragrance, it&#x27;s pleasant and sweet, but it doesn&#x27;t smell ANYTHING like mango. I was fortunate enough to grow up in the Caribbean surrounded by the intoxicating, summery smell of mangoes ripening on the tree, and there are few fragrances or flavors like that of a ripe mango. In my experience, 9 out of 10 products that claim to smell/taste like mango don&#x27;t - more like a blend of peach and apricot, as is the case once again here. But as the fragrance of this shave gel is still pleasant, it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference to me. It just doesn&#x27;t smell like ripe mangoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skintimate&#x27;s quite good, but if you&#x27;re wondering if it&#x27;ll be as good with your Venus razor as SatinCare is, I don&#x27;t think it is. Stick with SatinCare instead for Venus razors.Care instead for Venus razors.</li>
    <li> Three of the cans ran out air before half of the product was gone. The others ran very slow. The six cans I had before were way better. They were a different scent. I have reordered the other scent. I also noticed the price runs up a lot.</li>
    <li> Not a single canister was able to be used entirely before the expellant ran out. The last canister only allowed one use before it, too, refused to dispense any more product. This was a waste of money, and will never be purchased again for this household.</li>
    <li> Terrible. None of the cans worked. Complete waste of money. Thanks for nothing</li>
    <li> Order for 6 had 2 with defective nozzles</li>
    <li> I normally love this product, but one can only let me dispense half the can and the other five failed to dispense even once.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed.  I read the reviews and hoped they were wrong.  They were not.  I only got about 1/2 can worth of shaving gel out of the total 6 cans!!  I never got anything out of 3 of the cans. SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY You can tell they are full, but something is wrong with the way the dispenser works.  It is a shame, because I really liked the scent and the consistency and quality of the shaving gel.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the quality of this product.  2 can did not spray and 2 can only sprayed have of the material before they quit.  I have never had this problem before.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> about halfway through the first can the pump stopped working.  I thought it was a fluke so threw it away and started a second can.  This one stopped working about 1/4 way down.  I am now on the 3rd can and waiting to see what happens.</li>
    <li> Our whole family uses this product both the men and the women.  My husband and son says their faces never felt so smooth and no razor burns.  The women love how our legs feel.</li>
    <li> So far three of the bottles in this package have not worked!  I have used Skintimate for years and I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product came to me twice and I was unable to use because it lost its ability to pump out</li>
    <li> I was excited to order this through subscribe and save every 3 months.  I always use this product from the local store with no problems.  None of the cans I received this month will dispense at all.  They are not usable.</li>
    <li> I ordered  a set of these and NONE of them dispensed right.  They would only dispense about half the can, if that, and then stop.  I tried 3 cans and the same thing for each one - ANNOYING!  Amazon did a good job providing a refund for this purchase as they were obviously a messed up lot of cans.  I am going back to getting my shave gel from the store instead of subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Have newborn baby at home so I thought I would stock up on the essentials so I don&#x27;t have to drag her out and about yet. What new mom doesn&#x27;t want to shave and feel fresh and clean after 10 months of being pregnant? The first 3 cans I opened don&#x27;t dispense shaving cream. I haven&#x27;t tried the others yet as I was too frustrated and thought what lite time I had would be better used to write this review than see if other cans defective also. Can&#x27;t believe I have to give this even one star to posr my review. Deserves a giant zero</li>
    <li> I always buy skintimate in the stores and never have issues. I bought these online because I just had a baby via csection a few days prior and couldn&#x27;t physically go to the store and buy more. I&#x27;ve had to throw away 2 almost full cans because the lever quit working to squirt the gel out. SO DISAPPOINTED and what a waste!! I&#x27;ll never buy these off amazon again!!</li>
    <li> Every single can would not work. As soon as you open it and push the button, nothing would come out. The entire box is useless!!</li>
    <li> As the other reviewers said, I was only able to dispense a little bit of the can.  You could tell the can was still very full, but it would not come out.  So far 4 out of 6 cans have not dispensed properly and I&#x27;ve had to throw them away.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have bought this in stores for years, but I thought I could save some time and money by doing Subscribe and Save.  However, I have at least four cans here that are more than half full because they stopped spraying.  Very frustrating when you&#x27;re wet in the shower, ready to shave, and you have to yell for your hubby to please come grab a new can of shave gel for you.  I figure this is Skintimate&#x27;s issue, but it caused me to cancel my Subscribe and Save on this item and buy it in stores again.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and it lathers great. I wish it came with less bottles with subscribe and save because can&#x27;t seem to go through 6 in 6 months.</li>
    <li> Shave gel can didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I got this for my Daughter after she say it on Amazon. She says it is perfect! And being a woman I am sure she would know. If you want a great scented shave gel, then you would have a hard time finding anything better then this.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t stop raving about this product! I could never get a close shave without cutting my skin but then i bought this shaving gel! I always went for the generic brand to save a couple of cents but this was worth it! DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE ITEM!!!!</li>
    <li> Will not spray out of can.So far 4 cans , I have tried and will not work.So what I thought I was saving buying in bulk was a joke.</li>
    <li> 4 out of 6 cans wouldn&#x27;t spray out any shaving cream at all. First one worked and by the time I realized the others didn&#x27;t I couldn&#x27;t return them.</li>
    <li> Every single one stopped working halfway through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal is to provide a thorough review to assist others with their purchase, as there are many choices on Amazon and I personally rely on reviews when making most of my purchases.  If my review was helpful to you, please choose “yes” below.  Otherwise, choose “no” and please leave a constructive comment and I will take your thoughts and/or suggestions into consideration for future reviews.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 6-pk as a Subscribe and Save item. So far I have opened 5 of the 6 cans and 3 of the 5 did not work and had to be thrown out completely full. So much for savings! More like wastings!</li>
    <li> Every single can in this pack was defective. Most of which I was only able to pump several times before it stopped working. Very frustrating.</li>
