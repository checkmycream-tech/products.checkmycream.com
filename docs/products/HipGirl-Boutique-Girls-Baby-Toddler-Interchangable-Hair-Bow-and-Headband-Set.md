    <li> My daughter loves the headbands and the bows. Good selection that came in the box and I satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> The set is very well made the bows are separate or on the bands. My grand-daughter had not been into warring any thing she is 18 moths old . She wares these without issues. She loves them.</li>
    <li> Got these for my niece, they are very good quality. The best deal I found for so many pieces. I like that they are interchangable and I found them very well made. The headbands are very gentle and not going to pinch little girls heads. The colors were very bright and happy.</li>
    <li> I have a 10 year old and 5 year old and they both love this set. Great purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! My daughter love it to . She looks gorgeous with her hair bands. I&#x27;m gonna order more!!!</li>

    <li> I was very pleased with the quality and the bows are very well made. SUCH A GREAT FIND!! Buy this now!!!</li>
    <li> My daughters were thrilled to have so many new hair accessories! The colors and quality of the material is fantastic.</li>
    <li> It is nice to have a variety of colors and bows that can be interchanged to provide a different look and style</li>
    <li> These do work well mixing the bows and headbands and are great quality. They are slightly big though for my 3 year old that I bought them for. Fit my 5 year old perfectly.</li>
    <li> I like that they are interchangeable and can be worn in many ways...&lt;br /&gt;Gave it 4  stars coz, a few bows are so big and the size of the bows are not uniform. The picture shows that all the bows are of the same size. But, the solid color ones are twice as big as the one with prints.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.  They are simple to exchange and perfect for a hip girl.</li>
    <li> Very nice for a little girl who&#x27;s a fashionista. She was very happy with this as a side gift next to a larger gift.</li>
    <li> I bought these as favors for my daughters 5th birthday. I let the kids pick a headband and a bow as they arrived. They all really loved these. They fit well and were very high quality. I might just purchase this again so my daughter has the whole set!</li>
    <li> Well made. Good Product. Really cute.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old loves wearing these.  I love being able to customize her head bands to match whatever outfit she wears. Additionally, if you break a head band, as my 1 yo has done, you can save the bow and use it on other bands.  The bows can also be used independently as hair clips.  Really great versatile product.</li>
    <li> They come in a very nice, reusable box. Very good to mix and match. Quality product, only had an issue with one headband wanting to unravel, but it was easily fixed.</li>
    <li> They are beautiful...My daughter love it and she wear them every day.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my granddaughter for Christmas, and she loves them! The hair accessories are all beautiful, of high quality, and very pretty colors.</li>
    <li> Poorly constructed. The bows are simply glued on to hair clips. Not quite what I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> I loved this product,  my daughter loves everyone. ..</li>
    <li> When you have a little girl who is particular about what outfit matches her accessories, then this is the perfect headband ensemble. Easy to use, colorful and good bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> I have 3 little girls it&#x27;s been 2 years since we&#x27;ve purchased these and they&#x27;ve held up so well, I will be purchasing more, great quality, they don&#x27;t unravel and came in cute packaging</li>
    <li> Really excellent products! I bought it for my 2 year old daughter but the headband is slightly large...nonetheless, the bows are adorable and everything is well made. We&#x27;ll definitely be using it as she grows :)</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I love these! Just need more bows to give my daughter&#x27;s an endless selection!</li>
    <li> Best thing ever for little girls who love to color coordinate their outfits with a matching bow. Soo many combinations, my granddaughter loves them.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairband purchase I have ever made. High quality, beautiful colors, and easy to mix and match. Can&#x27;t wait to use them all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful bows.  Great quality and fun for my 6 year old to mix and match.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Adorable!  Good quality ribbons and hairbands!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage niece.  Although it seemed little girlish, I thought how adorable.  I knew she would love the detachable bows.  I just love all the different patterns and design.  Totally cute for little girls or young teenagers!</li>
    <li> I have two 9 year olds that love to wear headbands and hairbows. This is perfect for them to mix and match and go with or without the bow or the headband. The colors and patterns are great. I would like to see even more patterns or maybe some flowers to go with the selection.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved them with all the different colors.  Would definitely recommend them for other girls who like to wear headbands.</li>
    <li> This is a really great idea and the mix and match allows so many possible combinations.  The quality of the headbands and barrettes is good and the colors are nice and vivid.  My daughter is 8 and into putting together her own fashion so this is fun and creative.  She sometimes needs a hand fitting the clip into the headband weave, but not a big deal.  Good buy overall.</li>
    <li> These were bought as a Christmas gift so we have not used them yet but they are adorable and good quality. They also come in a cute box perfect for a gift.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 18 piece set. Love it. My 9 year old loves these. She can match them to her outfits completely. And I love wearing them too and everyone says how cute they are. They are just the right size for both of us. They are very nicely made and you can&#x27;t beat tge price.</li>
    <li> My niece loved it!  She wears head bands every day no matter what.  She even wears one with a pony tail.</li>
    <li> The bows and headbands looked exactly like they did in the pictures. My 8 year old loves mixing and matching the different colors and patterns. Very cute!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. My daughter loves them!</li>
    <li> I wish there were more bows. The headbands are tightly wrapped and the bows and bright, pretty and sturdy. Overall, the price is right for the assortment. Im pleased with the product</li>
    <li> these headbands and bows are super adorable.  my 9 year old daughter loves to change the bows and pick a new combination every day.  they are well crafted and beautiful.</li>
    <li> These are really cute. Fun to interchange. Perfect for my two year old. They came fast and in the way described.</li>
