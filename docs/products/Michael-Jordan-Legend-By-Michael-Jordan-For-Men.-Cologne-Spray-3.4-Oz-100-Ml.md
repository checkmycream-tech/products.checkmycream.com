      <li>Nice work, MJ..</li>
      <li>A really nice surprise for a celebrity fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Legend is nice..</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t know how effective it is as a deodorant but worked for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Package came fast and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>A nice affordable gourmand colone.</li>
      <li>This is some pretty sexy cologne probably the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>This one just smells okay, and nothing exceptional.</li>
      <li>Its a strong pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>First let me start of by saying, this fragrance is an incredible deal for the money.  </li>
      <li>she could smell me strongly from about 20 feet away!  </li>
      <li>ok and good silage cheap fragrance for the price</li>
      <li>package arrived quickly, price was good, and i love this product</li>
      <li>This gourmand is lovely.</li>
      <li>Purchased for my husband-we both love it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>im def gettin another bottle my rating 7/10 :)</li>
      <li>Legend is not quite what I had in mind, but for sure it is a keeper.</li>
      <li>smells awesome, second bottle.</li>
      <li>This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne...</li>
      <li>Hubby&#x27;s favorite and I can&#x27;t complain :).</li>
      <li>I love it!&amp;#34</li>
      <li>This fragrance would be great for someone to be wear in very cold&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>/&gt;MJ Legend is a pretty good gourmand fragrance for being so inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>Out of the bottle, you get the top notes of vanilla or amber that settles to the sweeter musky notes that is easy on the nose.  </li>
      <li>But definately go easy on the trigger.  </li>
      <li>I like the strong caramel and vanilla notes with hints of chocolate....</li>
      <li>Not too strong.</li>
      <li>Its not as strong as I wanted</li>
      <li>wonderful cologne, great for work and casual wear.</li>
      <li>Still, unless my wife and i are going out for the evening, or when the weather tapers down from the heat, I believe that is when Legend is best suited.</li>
      <li>Yes it most certainly did!!</li>
      <li>I recently ran out of deodorant and I started using it, and it works great -</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll enjoy this.</li>
      <li>Fantastic scent.</li>
      <li>The skin scent is great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>I also detect a light cognac-like \\&quot;boozy\\&quot; quality to it as well (and no, I&#x27;m not referring to a cheap alcohol scent).  </li>
      <li>Figured I would give it a try because its Jordan and it ended up being a fantastic scent that got tons of complements</li>
      <li>even though it is dirt cheap, it smells like a million bucks.  </li>
      <li>I think they look cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>I have a few of the MJ fragrances and this one may be the best of the lot...</li>
      <li>advise only wearing it at night as it is not a fresh/clean/powder smell appropriate for outdoor or daytime activities, but something darker, stronger, more sensuous, more appropriate for dinner and the theater.</li>
      <li>Cologne smell Good and last about 5 hours or more</li>
      <li>I think the hints of coffee caught more because I do not drink the beverage, but I enjoy the smell of fresh brewed when it is around.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good normal but unique and fast delivery loved it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s unique scent.</li>
      <li>It is a great winter fragrance, a straight-up gourmand, but not loud or obtrusive.  </li>
      <li>I have a couple, but for me I would rather have the creation in its original form, whether that is an oil or cologne.</li>
      <li>Legend by Michael Jordan marks my return to the arena of buying cologne, the first time in more than 8 years.</li>
      <li>sayers\\&quot; out there that the fragrance is too sweet.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sweet, spicy aroma.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a sweet syrupy one</li>
      <li>and I like sweet fragrances.</li>
      <li>Fall, winter, possibly cool spring nights.</li>
      <li>Not cloying or too sweet.</li>
      <li>A bit too sweet for my taste.</li>
      <li>Super sweet, so if you do not like sweet gourmands, you might want to look elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>As time wore on it took a completely different direction that to me was nothing like what I liked about it to begin with Iam dissappointed with the product but will use it till it&#x27;s gone</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 or 4 different cologne products - this is the only one that I get repeated compliments on!&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s why I keep wearing it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too big on colognes and wanted to start my collection with this after browsing reviews on YouTube.  I also read some reviews that said the longevity and projection is weak.  I must say that on my skin it lasts around 2 hours.  The projection is very low, almost a skin scent only cologne. The next day I sprayed liberally (5-6 sprays) on my clothes and it didn&#x27;t help.  Overall it&#x27;s okay, nothing amazing.  The skin scent is great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and long lasting. Got this for our 18 yr old and he loves it. he thinks its a little more sophisticated than the other Jordan scents....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for a Christmas present. He loves it and I love it. It smells great!! And it&#x27;s long lasting as well</li>
    <li> Lasts about 2 minutes..A bit too sweet for my taste. Would not recommend at all..</li>
    <li> This is some pretty sexy cologne probably the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever had. girls at school always tell me how good i smell. but hey thats just what i be saying.</li>
    <li> smells awesome, second bottle.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t fine these locally anymore and found for a fait price on line. Great smell for men.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son. He loves the smell. Not too strong. Appealing to young adult males.  Young women seem to like the scent</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased it for her dad for Christmas. Package came fast and in perfect condition. Although it is very potent it smells very, very nice. Recommendation - use a little as it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Hello,         I was drawn to this product because it was decidedly different to what I normally wear. But to me,it was the aroma at application that drew me to it. As time wore on it took a completely different direction that to me was nothing like what I liked about it to begin with Iam dissappointed with the product but will use it till it&#x27;s gone</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t let the price fool you... this cologne is a winner.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy it the only CON I felt was it rather light but still a 5 star review!</li>
    <li> Excellent and my product came on time.</li>
    <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne...can&#x27;t get enough of this aroma...thank you Amazon for an amazing price too.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. We can&#x27;t it anywhere but here and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Everyone I come in contact with is like &amp;#34;Omg! What cologne are you wearing?! I love it!&amp;#34; That should tell you all you need to know.</li>
    <li> I am not going to lie. Michael Jordan Legend is a great fragrance. It&#x27;s not amazing. It&#x27;s just great. And it&#x27;s a celebrity fragrance to boot! Why it doesn&#x27;t cost half an arm and a leg? I don&#x27;t know, but wow--it&#x27;s like something your rich uncle gives you because he&#x27;s already got a backup bottle stashed away somewhere in his closet (along with his 200+ other fragrances). The perfume snobs say it smells like Rochas Man and New Haarlem Bond. I don&#x27;t know. I haven&#x27;t tried them. Michael Jordan Legend, I got just so I could layer with Givenchy Pi . Alone? I don&#x27;t like it too much. I respect it. It smells good. It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s just not my go-to scent. But layer it with Givenchy Pi? And it becomes amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good normal but unique and fast delivery loved it</li>
    <li> I bought this and a Rochas Man tester.  I returned Rochas Man since they are identical.  I also smelled Bond No. 9&#x27;s New Haarlem at Sephora and that smells the same to me as well.  I&#x27;m not a fragrance connoisseur, but 99.9% of the world isn&#x27;t either.</li>
    <li> Best bang for the buck. U get what U pay for doesnt necessarly apply here... This smells non synthetic to me bc its pretty powerful and blended very well. It smells very close to New Harlem by bond no 9. Believe what you read. Its good.</li>
    <li> Wrong! Jeeeeeeeez, they&#x27;re selling this for under $20?! I&#x27;d have paid over double that if I had smelled this blindfolded in a department store. No joke. This gourmand is lovely. I can think of zero reasons not to buy this. Even if you don&#x27;t like gourmands, buy it as a gift to someone. I don&#x27;t care if you are a collector or just think ha the average guy looking to try out your first gourmand, buy this. Don&#x27;t over spray and then get all butthurt talkin&#x27; bout \\&quot;It&#x27;s too cloying! Whine. Cry.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coffee sets the fragrance off and the spices kick in and settle this baby right down into a delicious dry down that lasts for several hours. Longevity is great with this one. Sillage is better than average too. Check this one out if you want a cheap addition to your wardrobe that will bring some joy and excitement to your fragrance journey through the gourmand section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t spray this stuff like an idiot during the hot summer months and head out into the world. K? This is a colder weather scent. Fall, winter, possibly cool spring nights. But let&#x27;s not get crazy.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Bought this for my son last year and he requested it again this Christmas. He loves it.</li>
    <li> package arrived quickly, price was good, and i love this product</li>
    <li> best cologne and am loving it, people keep asking where I got it from, been ordering it every three month</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband-we both love it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent. Hubby&#x27;s favorite and I can&#x27;t complain :). Great price for the amount of fragrance.</li>
    <li> This cologne is cheap with expensive characteristics. It&#x27;s stays on all day and has a very nice aroma that doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MJ&#x27;s other fragrances, and they generally fit into the \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; genre, but this one is distinctly different...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MJ Legend is a pretty good gourmand fragrance for being so inexpensive.  I like the strong caramel and vanilla notes with hints of chocolate.... I also detect a light cognac-like \\&quot;boozy\\&quot; quality to it as well (and no, I&#x27;m not referring to a cheap alcohol scent).  It gets due credit for being similar to Rochas Man, but stronger.  I would say the quality of Legend isn&#x27;t quite that of Rochas, and the notes are somewhat different, but it&#x27;s good enough that I have layered both together in order to use less Rochas on certain occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company producing the fragrance for MJ (5 Star Fragrances) did a good job with this one.  I like the extra sillage and longevity I get as compared to Rochas Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one won&#x27;t win any awards but can be a good addition as a casual use stand-alone fragrance, or as a layer cologne with other gourmands.  Thumbs up</li>
    <li> Good scent, lasts around 2 hours. Nobody I asked knew what it was and it was fairly priced. Its not as strong as I wanted but it gets the job done and The complements i get are also always a plus.</li>
    <li> smellz like Jordan.....</li>
    <li> This is a decent cologne but doesn&#x27;t last at all. The scent is gone within a few hours. It may scent a bit if you sniff hard but it just doesn&#x27;t project. I recently ran out of deodorant and I started using it, and it works great - then again I stay in an air-conditioned office all day so I wouldn&#x27;t know how effective it is as a deodorant but worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, the scent is somewhat overrated by other reviews - then again it may be a matter of opinion and personal taste as I love fresh musky scent. This one just smells okay, and nothing exceptional. For the price one can&#x27;t really complain BUT I got a range of other colognes when getting this (see image) and Nautica Voyage, Jovan Sex Appeal, and One Man Show is the closest to Legend&#x27;s price range and all three give me better results - Nautica for the fresh scent (which lasts longer), One Man Show for the longevity, and spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are into colognes and fragrances then you should skip this, but if you want something extremely subtle then you can get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I buy from only Fragrancenet because I trust them.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with the Michael Jordan cologne, it was shipped quick &amp; turned out to be a great gift for someone!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne! It could also be for women, but I prefer it on my husband!</li>
    <li> Michael Jordan Legend drives me crazy! The fragrance is manly, my husband and I agree that this is the best of the Michael Jordan line. We tried the others and have decided this is the one! I&#x27;m a little jealous when other women ask him what cologne he is wearing.</li>
    <li> wonderful cologne, great for work and casual wear.It lasts all day on my skin. I gets compliments at work about it&#x27;s unique scent. I would definitely recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> Michael jordan legend is a syrup /pancake vibe compared to new harlem bond no9 it projects ok and good silage cheap fragrance for the price im def gettin another bottle my rating 7/10 :)</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because it was cheap, and was very pleasantly surprised.  It&#x27;s a sweet, spicy aroma.  Cocoa, coffee, caramel, dark baking spices (cinnamon, nutmeg).  I don&#x27;t think of it as manly per se, there&#x27;s very little if any musk or woodiness to it, but my girlfriend LOVES it.  Who am I to argue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise only wearing it at night as it is not a fresh/clean/powder smell appropriate for outdoor or daytime activities, but something darker, stronger, more sensuous, more appropriate for dinner and the theater.</li>
    <li> A nice affordable gourmand colone. Smells similar to Rochaman. Vanilla,chocolate creamy powdery. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Givenchy PI cologne, but is still good smelling stuff, not pricey like the mall either. This is my 2nd time buying you&#x27;ll enjoy</li>
    <li> Figured I would give it a try because its Jordan and it ended up being a fantastic scent that got tons of complements</li>
    <li> Best bang for buck cologne period. If you like rochas man, givenchy pi, new haarlem, or even le male this is for you, and for me...</li>
    <li> Alot of people will not agree with the smell. I personally think its a situational smell that can&#x27;t be worn in everyday situations. Because of its composition, I would restrict using this to a cold winter night.</li>
    <li> Michael Jordan Legend cologne is a great fragrance. It smells exactly like Pi by Givenchy for men, but for a fraction of the price. even after an entire day of use, the scent continues to remain. I usually put it on in the morning, after I take a shower; before I go to sleep at night, I take a shower, small hints of vanilla remain on spots where I placed the cologne.</li>
    <li> on time thank you soooo much this was for my dad a present and he loved it its the bomb lol</li>
    <li> This gourmand can&#x27;t be beat for the price. Got quite a few compliments wearing this one. Not cloying or too sweet.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend occasionally wore the original jordan cologne and i came across this... I love the smell and he gets soo many compliments on this cologne!!!</li>
    <li> Smells like a more expensive cologne. If you like the brand by &#x27;Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27; &#x27;Le Male&#x27; you&#x27;ll enjoy this. Very similar smell, it also last a good amount of time. I recommend this for late 20&#x27;s and up. For the younger people get the orginal Jordan cologne or Flight Jordan.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with my previous order from this is a spray head that didn&#x27;t work. I replaced it with another spray head from a Jordan bottle. If you have that problem Amazon will help you out</li>
    <li> Legend by Michael Jordan marks my return to the arena of buying cologne, the first time in more than 8 years. While it will never become a mainstay for me, this trip shows a totally different, much more mature man than the one who purposely left off from buying cologne. My preference is oils, since the smell lasts so much longer at a fraction of the cost, and no. I do not care for designer scents in oils. I have a couple, but for me I would rather have the creation in its original form, whether that is an oil or cologne. Legend is not quite what I had in mind, but for sure it is a keeper. It definitely has a sweet, spicy smell to it, and I cannot recall ever smelling anything faintly like it. That is not a negative at all, just unexpected. I think the hints of coffee caught more because I do not drink the beverage, but I enjoy the smell of fresh brewed when it is around. Still, unless my wife and i are going out for the evening, or when the weather tapers down from the heat, I believe that is when Legend is best suited. I have a few months to test the theory, so I&#x27;ll see. ~K.I.S.S~</li>
    <li> First let me start of by saying, this fragrance is an incredible deal for the money.  It smells very expensive&lt;br /&gt;and can be had at places like Ross for 12.99 for the big bottle.  It is definitely a gourmand as you can definitely&lt;br /&gt; smell the coffee and vanilla in it.  It is very similar to Rochas Man, but more like an intense version of it as the&lt;br /&gt; project and sillage on this fragrance are very very impressive.  But definately go easy on the trigger.  One time i&lt;br /&gt;was going to meet up with my girlfriend to study and right before I had applied 4 sprays (neck, chest, both wrists)&lt;br /&gt;and she could smell me strongly from about 20 feet away!  And though I do praise this fragrance on what it does well,&lt;br /&gt; it is definately too sweet for me and can be a little cloying, especially on an empty stomach (felt very nauseous when&lt;br /&gt;applied in the morning without eating breakfast).  This fragrance would be great for someone to be wear in very cold&lt;br /&gt; weather or who wants to get noticed, maybe at a bar or club to out smell the smoke or whatever else is around them.</li>
    <li> MJ...Legend smells like french toast &amp; a little hint of vanilla to me . Basiclly breakfast in a bottle!!!</li>
    <li> Cologne smell Good and last about 5 hours or more My girlfriend uses the cologne as well, My girlfriend loves the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne it sort of smells like&lt;br /&gt;a rich chocoloate, mixed with a great&lt;br /&gt;nostalgic smell. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have a few of the MJ fragrances and this one may be the best of the lot... Total blind purchase and I am pleasantry surprised.  There are some \\&quot;nay sayers\\&quot; out there that the fragrance is too sweet.  It is sweet, but in my humble opinion, is the right masculine mix that doesn&#x27;t cross the line.  Out of the bottle, you get the top notes of vanilla or amber that settles to the sweeter musky notes that is easy on the nose.  Nice work, MJ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The projection, sillage, and longevity are average, perhaps a \\&quot;smidgeon\\&quot; (yes, I am a Southerner) better than average, that lasts about 4-5 hours on the skin and much longer on clothing - I usually give a spray to my undershirt and sleeve cuff to get that occasional whiff during the day.  Legend is nice.. While I have only worn once, and no compliments were received, it has that potential.  Sweetie, however, did give it a thumbs up providing the morning \\&quot;smell test\\&quot; prior to my departure to work.  Additionally, she commented following when I told her it was a MJ fragrance, \\&quot;it smells higher end than that..\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legend provides great flexibility and versatility that can be worn just about anytime.  The bottle and packaging are about average - I will add that of the MJ colognes I have, I think more could be spent on the nozzles.  (ok, call me weird to notice the spray nozzles).  I think they look cheaply made.  I like a cologne bottle that looks great and gives the impression of a piece of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price/value of this fragrance is very appealing.  Given that it is a nice smelling scent, the price/value (less than $20 for a large bottle), definitely gets a strong endorsement for buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for MJ&#x27;s Legend is 4.1 stars out of 5.  It is a great scent that has above average longevity.  The price is right with plenty of potential for the \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;.. Go for it..!!  Life is great - remember that honesty and integrity can never be trained - they are in your makeup and earned..</li>
    <li> I like the scent, it&#x27;s a sweet syrupy one and I like sweet fragrances. Only issue was it just didn&#x27;t last on my skin at all. Within an hour you couldn&#x27;t tell I had anything on at all. I don&#x27;t like overpowering fragrances but I like them to last a few hours at least.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and price was great.</li>
    <li> smells great my son loves it.</li>
    <li> Its a strong pleasant smell.  It only takes like 2 sprays.</li>
    <li> This one is cheaper than a typical outing to the movies, but it smells like something that would cost three times as much.  For the price, it is a total gem.  It is a great winter fragrance, a straight-up gourmand, but not loud or obtrusive.  Super sweet, so if you do not like sweet gourmands, you might want to look elsewhere.  I mainly get coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and brown sugar out of this one.  Great date scent, and even though it is dirt cheap, it smells like a million bucks.  A really nice surprise for a celebrity fragrance.  It does not have great longevity in the grand scheme of fragrances, but for an EDC concentration, the longevity is impressive (~6 hours).  Ladies like this one - if you want to smell edible, it is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Yes it most certainly did!!</li>
    <li> This Legend Cologne Smells Like French Vanilla Coffee</li>
    <li> Smells like pancakes that were burnt on a griddle.</li>
