<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the perfume I like the most, even my girlfriend!&lt;br /&gt;It is a duty to replace it as soon the other one is almost empty.</li>
    <li> Tested this out at department store and the price is better here than there!</li>
    <li> I was browsing at Macy&#x27;s for some fragrances, found this at the counter. I tested it on tester strip and loved it. So I applied it on my skin from that tester bottle. I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist, it was an irresistible smell. Found this here at Amazon at a great price, so ordered immediately. Got the product in about 6-7 days (Standard Shipping). The product was made in UK and everything looked genuine.    This is a cool and fresh summer fragrance. The notes are as follows:  Top Notes: Tangerine, Bergamot, Tomato Leaves, Cassis  Heart Notes: Black Pepper, Rose  Base Notes: Patchouli, Sandalwood, Woody Notes    When you first apply, you get the top notes of citrus-y tangerine, tomato leaves(good leaves). Then you smell the peppers. Finally the base notes mellow down to Sandalwood and woody. It lasts about 6-8 hours. I was told that this fragrance re-projects if you start to sweat, but I am in a cold weather, will test this for real in summer.    Bottle and box are classy, great presentation there.    Recommended for College students, Blue collars, Date or Dinner. You cannot go wrong with this. But if you want to make the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; choice, I would suggest to try both \\&quot;Lacoste Essential\\&quot; and \\&quot;212 Men by Carolina Herrara\\&quot; before you buy them. They both are along the same line but I like 212 better for it&#x27;s longevity.</li>
    <li> Ordered this cologne as I have used it in the past and liked it and was sent the wrong cologne as it was the sport edition instead of the regular.  Contacted seller and we will see how they respond to the situation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this cologne before so I knew I&#x27;d like it. What I was leery about was, am I going to get what I ordered. And I did and I am very happy because I haven&#x27;t had a woman say she didn&#x27;t like the cologne.</li>
    <li> The product was shipped/arrived in a couple of days...was packaged well with no problems/breakage.    Great price, great scent - would definitely order again!!</li>
    <li> i know this product for so long has the nicest smell and it was a nice price. i invite you all to test it and love it</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance-it is a subtle fragrance. IT requires a lot to go the distance, but other than that, it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Decent price too! My 13 year old son loves this stuff. Plan to order from here in the future.</li>
    <li> Very good product!!!.. Smell so good... An my wife like that!!!....  Three star because I know had on other bether option in amazona!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. It is clearly superior to all other Lacoste scents which tend to be overwhelming and far too woodsy. Essential is a fresh scent for spring and summer. It cannot be applied too heavily, as I have noticed with the other Lacoste scents. I think the price point is perfectly appropriate. Be sure to order through Amazon to assure that you don&#x27;t end up with &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; bottles of cologne that have aged and lost their true essence. I have made the mistake of buying the cheapest offer on several occasions and am always sorely disappointed with the quality of the product. Fr.....net and other suppliers will be sure to disappoint.</li>
    <li> Always get complemented on the citrus amazing smell!! :D</li>
    <li> The product is great! Exact description and matched to a T! Will definitely recommend to all my friends! Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> What a thriller! This scent just makes me smell so fresh and so clean when I look at the man in the mirror... The ladies love it, especially Billie Jean. Some even call me a maniac cause I&#x27;m just so sexy when I don this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby for Christmas, he smells so yummy!</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling cologne for men. Very suttle and just smells great. Hubby loves it too. Will buy more</li>
    <li> Very Good Quality I recommend this product for everyone who concern about Lacoste Essential from Lacoste Go and Try it Now!</li>
    <li> Love this cologne and yes it is the same stuff you can buy at any high priced store at the mall.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Very clean scent</li>
    <li> I choose this cologne cause it has a nice scent for my husband. It&#x27;s not strong. Just the right amount of citrus sweet:). He likes it. It&#x27;s cheaper at Amazon than any place I looked.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my product. I was looking for this scent and thats exactly what I got, that&#x27;s it. If you are looking for a deep manly smell then a very light hint of sweet man that comes from the cologne heating off the body that women love, then you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
    <li> Have gotten a lot of complements on it. It&#x27;s subtle, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GI0S62 Lacoste Essential By Lacoste For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounces]]    Wonderful light and fresh smell.  I have about 40 co-workers, all of which enjoy this scent.</li>
    <li> This is my scent, super awesome</li>
    <li> It is very very good, i love the smell and fell satisfied with the transfer to Venezuela thanks to you.</li>
    <li> best smelling cologne ever!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone.  This spray is one of the best sprays of all time as the smell is not strong but perfect.</li>
    <li> Smells great and it arrived very quick! I was afraid it would be old and smell old as well but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Received my order quick and in original packaging even down to the plastic wrap. The price was most definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first since I&#x27;d never bought a fragrance online before and I&#x27;ve read horror stories about people receiving fake or old products that had gone bad, but this stuff is just as good as what you can buy at the mall and it&#x27;s SO MUCH CHEAPER. I bought the 4.2 oz size for my boyfriend and paid about $45 for it, which is an extremely good deal. So in case anyone&#x27;s wondering, yes, this is the genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;About the fragrance itself: it smells amazing. It&#x27;s a very fresh and sporty smell, great for younger guys who don&#x27;t want to use a scent that smells too old for them, if you get what I mean. Definitely fits with Lacoste&#x27;s preppy, sporty image. Slightly citrus-y, but in a good way, a clean, masculine way. It&#x27;s not too strong and it seems to last for a reasonable length of time. Of course, everyone has their personal taste when it comes to fragrance, but I&#x27;d consider this a relatively inoffensive and pleasant smell at worst, and a very alluring fragrance at best. Highly recommended for college guys who want something light but captivating. As a girl, I can attest that it smells irresistible, at least on my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many colognes over the years, but this one has been my favorite for five years running, and I can&#x27;t see changing it. I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments with this than with any other fragrance. Read the description here or on other sites, but reactions like &amp;#34;you smell like a breezy summer evening&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;I could smell you all day&amp;#34; mean a lot more to me than words like &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;citrus notes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it. Slap it on. Enjoy the swooning of the ladies.</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and divine for a men.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent for daily use.  However, it fails to last.  Shame, as I get compliments on the scent, but only in the morning.  By lunch time it is gone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and he really liked it..you can get in the upper stores for a much higher cost...the price was great and excellent scent.....</li>
    <li> Smells good. My son gets a lot of compliments from friends and family. Definitely will buy again when it&#x27;s finished.</li>
    <li> it&#x60;s good,i like it, at the begining the smell is strong, then, the smell decreases until keeping a stable, nice, fresh and good smell</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal and smells great</li>
    <li> I am almost done with this bottle and through out the use of it I have been complimented on it plenty of times.  I just might but a second bottle,  which is a first for me; usually I switch it up.</li>
    <li> Excellent deal. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great smell, but doesn&#x27;t last as long like others.</li>
    <li> Great does not dissapoint!</li>
    <li> Having heard stories of purchasing cologne online I was somewhat skeptical. This cologne smelled exactly the way it should and lasts. It mellows over time the way a good cologne should.</li>
    <li> One of the FEW very FEW colognes ive ever been told to buy as a blindbuy. SUCCESS. It smells like tomato leaves and it gets me compliments from the females at my workplace all the time. It is veru nonoffensive and wemon seem to love its smell on me which is defenatly a plus. Longevity is a bit lacking I get between 4-5 hours on an average day and it has little projection which is fine by me since I dont like to stinkup the work office. On me personally it projects about a foot to a foot and a half away from me which is great. BUY THIS YOU WON&#x27;T REGREAT IT.</li>
    <li> Item Delivered fast and as described on website.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like? It&#x27;s my favorite scent. Obviously less expensive here than in a fancy store. Well packaged too. yahoo</li>
    <li> Okay, so I must say I have purchased this before at macys and I thought it was stellar. I got compliments all the time and my ex loved it so much she took my bottle with her when she moved away (long distance doesn&#x27;t work). Anyways, I needed to replace it and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money so I looked on amazon. I also am the type to do my research and it was ridiculously cheap on here and had overall positive reviews with a few bad ones saying it was watered down or old stock, etc.. I chose to take the chance anyways. I made an error, this product does not smell anything remotely like genuine new stock Lacoste Essential. The box looks legit and so does the packaging, the only assumption I can make is that it is indeed either watered down or really old. I work in a chemical laboratory and am used to smelling chemicals all day. This bottle smells like straight alcohol, with a smidgen of I have no idea what. The smidgen isn&#x27;t even Lacoste like. I have no idea what this smell is. Lacoste cologne is also supposed to have a green tint to it, this bottle is almost completely clear. Save yourself the time, I had to call in to Amazon for a refund and they let me keep the bottle. I think I may give it to a homeless person, but then again why subject someone else to smelling like methanol. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it in my experiments if I ever run out of methanol. Then again, it probably isn&#x27;t even HPLC grade so that just won&#x27;t do. Save yourself the hassle and money, go to macys or sephora and buy it. Cologne doesn&#x27;t go on sale for a reason.</li>
    <li> It smells good at first but only for half an hour or so</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby and he loves this....oh and I do too!! Ladies this is a great gift for your husband;)</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent and I love it too.  What more can I say?  He&#x27;s going to soon run out and I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> It is very accurate. It was for a gift, and the person love it! He likes it a lot, good.</li>
    <li> great cologne to wear at work or play.  Received many compliments already.  After a few hours, it kind of switches gears to a woodsy, earthy scent.  Great value too for 4.2 oz bottle.  Highly recommend this cologne if you like a light cologne that doesn&#x27;t annoy people with an overpowering wallop of a smell.  Will purchase again when this bottle runs-out.</li>
    <li> This spray is one of the best sprays of all time as the smell is not strong but perfect. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
