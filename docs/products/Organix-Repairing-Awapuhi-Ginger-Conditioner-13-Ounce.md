      <li>Love love love this product!  </li>

      <li>Absolutely love these products.</li>
      <li>and I was in love</li>
      <li>I love the oil but</li>
      <li>I ran out of the oil and went for more and saw this line and decided to try it.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I would even say it needed to be more fragrant....</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not sure about people having rashes/allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>I love how this product smells.  </li>
      <li>I have had better results using cheaper brands.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Stunk to high heaven and didn&#x27;t feel great, almost like it wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
      <li>If you have exceptionally dry hair and need a heavier, more moisturizing conditioner then this may be perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sometimes you can buy a good product for a reasonable price and get the results you want....</li>
      <li>My hair has not felt this soft in about 4 or 5 months and it smells FANTASTIC!!!</li>
      <li>(seriously...I&#x27;ve thrown good conditioners away because they didn&#x27;t smell nice enough for me...</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine hair, but lots of it.  </li>
      <li>I could manage it fine</li>
      <li>Hair felt really smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Originally, I purchased this product just for my extensions</li>
      <li>The conditioner is both creamy and rich.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that is completely straight.</li>
      <li>but it was more that i paid 40 bucjs for this combo that really drove me</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not a bad smell at all, and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I have finally found something that actually does what it says and it smells wonderful too.</li>
      <li>My hair is super curly and about shoulder length.</li>
      <li>Most importantly it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it&#x27;s been nearly 7 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I went back and bought 2 more of each!</li>
      <li>I have baby fine straight hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a fresh fruit smoothie on my head.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once, but honestly...</li>
      <li>This one made my hair feel soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I only decided to go with this one since I liked the smell</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft, light and tangle free.  </li>
      <li>homemade coconut oil treatment and a quick order of my old standby Enjoy products</li>
      <li>They DON&#x27;T test on animals and most of their shampoos and conditioners are free of parabens, sulfates or other harsh chemicals which is great for you and for your hair.  </li>
      <li>I laughed a little.</li>
      <li>first</li>
      <li>Does not smell like Paul Michells Awapuhi Ginger shampoo/conditioner set and is a pretty greasy conditioner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first thing I noticed about it,</li>
      <li>However, after first use, I&#x27;m already debating if I should throw it away.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Later the smell dissipated and I noticed no irritation on my eyes and my hair was smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I washed and conditioned my hair with Organix Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo and Conditioner for the first time.  </li>
      <li>My extensions and leave out were unbelievably soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>great product for my coarse dry hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of OGX brand shampoo/conditioner in general and have loved almost all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried but with thick hair that builds oil quickly, the Repairing Awapuhi Ginger conditioner just wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
      <li>My fine, curly hair goes limp with heavy conditioners but this one makes my hair feel super glam and smells great.</li>
      <li>Overall I highly recommend the OGX brand if you&#x27;re looking for a more natural, environmentally friendly product.  </li>
      <li>I even left the conditioner in the full recommended 5 minutes, but you would think I didn&#x27;t use conditioner at all!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very particular about fragrances</li>
      <li>I have thick dry hair and it is one of the best products I have used.</li>
      <li>My hair had gotten so dry and fly away that I pinned a lament titled, Dry, Static Flyaway Hair and Other Sorrows.</li>
      <li>It certainly did what it was meant to do, it left my hair looking flatter than usual, but it really smelled good!</li>
      <li>OGX Awapuhi Ginger Conditioner smells wonderful but does leave my hair feeling heavy and a little greasy.  </li>
      <li>My naturally curly/dry hair immediately felt soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and will order it again.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to sink into the hair really well when it was warmed up to body temperature....</li>
      <li>They can put man on the moon but Not a great surprise that no one has managed to make a great shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love this product!  It&#x27;s the only thing that tames my Italian coarse gray (colored) hair!</li>
    <li> I use this along with the shampoo and my hair feels amazing!</li>
    <li> my hair was dry for months, I tried lots of products with no results, one day I decided to buy this conditioner together with the shampoo and the oil and I started feeling the difference from day one. now I want to buy another one plus the treatment. btw, my hair is red  and curly (natural) with highlights.</li>
    <li> I bought this without checking the reviews on it because I saw it on sale at my local shopping center while I was out getting other things. After 2 days of using the shampoo and conditioner, my hair looks terrible! I have had better results using cheaper brands. I even left the conditioner in the full recommended 5 minutes, but you would think I didn&#x27;t use conditioner at all! I&#x27;ve also broken out in a rash on my hands in the last 2 days since using this. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s related to the product or not, but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never broken out in any type of rash before using this product.  Stay away!</li>
    <li> Reading the product&#x27;s description, I had high hopes for Organix Awapuhi Ginger conditioner. However, after first use, I&#x27;m already debating if I should throw it away. In the shower, my hair felt so dry afterwards, even though it was all wet. I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through my long hair, so I ended up going back to my normal conditioner. I got this at the local drugstore, and usually I check Amazon reviews before buying a different product. There was only two reviews -- one good and one bad. So I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and try it. Big mistake. I also  got the Nutritional shampoo which is amazing, but am so disappointed in the results I got from this conditioner -- It gave me the opposite of what it claimed.</li>
    <li> Smells great, best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used - small amount makes my hair silky and I have no fly aways.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well and smells great. Decent lather. Doesn&#x27;t fade my color treated hair. The conditioner is great too.</li>
    <li> Nothing else to day - Best products for hair - I tried the moroccan oil (shampoo and conditioner) first and I was in love - then I continued with the rest of the different products and I cannot be happier - not even the very expensive treatments like Kerastasse or Tigi are working as good as Organix does with my hair - and for half the price or more</li>
    <li> I washed and conditioned my hair with Organix Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo and Conditioner for the first time.  It smells terrific!!  The conditioner is both creamy and rich. After washing the conditioner out, the product seemed to strip my hair of all it&#x27;s oils, leaving it dry, as opposed to repairing each strand as per the boasts in the products description.  I delicately combed my hair with a wide-tooth comb and my hair seemed to just fall out.  I have NEVER seem so much breakage from my, moderately thick, armpit length, relaxed hair.  I will be trashing both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was recommended by a stylist to use the Organix Moroccan Oil products to get the frizz out of my wavy Malayasian hair extensions. However, everywhere I went the Moroccan Oil products were either sold out or too expensive. I saw this one and like that it provided protection and repaired dry, damaged hair. I washed my hair and conditioned my hair with this product. My extensions and leave out were unbelievably soft and frizz free. My hair was shiny and soft without putting the Organix Awapuhi dry oil in my hair. I put the Awapuhi dry oil on the ends of my extensions and in my leave out. My hair was so bouncy and silky when I flat ironed it, and my dry scalp felt really refreshed and my flakes were all gone. Originally, I purchased this product just for my extensions but now I want to use this product for my natural hair. The smell of these products are unique...between a grape and a floral scent. Absolutely love these products.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with dry hair and scalp and irritated eyes from tonnes of shampoos even&lt;br /&gt;Those claiming to be organic and free of irritants.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried some in the organix range such as coconut milk, Brazilian and Shea butter all very irritating and all very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have been using the alchemy range&lt;br /&gt;Lavender shampoo and avocado conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Not great for the hair but dorsnt  irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the organix range added some new shampoo range and I checked out all of them from other peoples reviews and the two that got highest ratings were the awapuhi and ginger and macadamia oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the awapuhi one and conditioner and tried it yesterday. I noticed the shampoo lathered great almost foam like and smooth so you don&#x27;t need a lot. A small dollop is fine and it had little scent and felt relaxed on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner a different story. Stunk to high heaven and didn&#x27;t feel great, almost like it wasn&#x27;t there. Almost felt  nauseated so if your tolerance to scent isn&#x27;t great be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later the smell dissipated and I noticed no irritation on my eyes and my hair was smooth and soft. I could manage it fine so I was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Later that day approximately 4 hours later my eyes started watering so I thought oh no. What a Shame it&#x27;s turning out to be like the rest. That same evening my eye Lids felt and looked red and sore which disappointed me greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I decided to be courageous and give it another but it was more that i paid 40 bucjs for this combo that really drove me :)  I proceeded minus one element !  the conditioner. I used my old conditioner from the alchemy range the avocado .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same result no irritation styled nicely and was pleased. Now came the moment of truth, the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited 3 hours and no irritation&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited 4 hours no irritation no watery eyes&lt;br /&gt;It is now 5 hours laterand still  no watery eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My suspicions were correct the conditioner was too irritating. They can put man on the moon but Not a great surprise that no one has managed to make a great shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the shampoo and will keep using it as it hydrates my dry hair leaves it soft abd easy to manage . Most importantly it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it&#x27;s been nearly 7 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have had the difficulty as I with finding a nice shampoo that moisturises and repairs dry hair without irritating the eyes then be prepared to be pleasantly surprised with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate it 9 out  of 10. Kudos Organix . :)</li>
    <li> Love this! It smells really good and it lasted me a long time, plus it was a little cheaper than it would have been in the store!</li>
    <li> Does not smell like Paul Michells Awapuhi Ginger shampoo/conditioner set and is a pretty greasy conditioner. I use maybe less than a teaspoon of this for my shoulder length haircut and still feels like I didn&#x27;t wash it out enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is more like a perfume/cologne/old lady/potpourri smell :(</li>
    <li> I really like this product and will order it again.  I would recommend this product to everyone that is in search of a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing. Literally, after one use my hair feels so soft and silky. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better conditioner.</li>
    <li> First, my hair is thick and curly. I color it and use a hot blow dryer and pull it straight, then flat iron it on the hottest setting. This winter has been unusually cold, thus the air is drier outside, and inside due to the heat coming on more often. My hair had gotten so dry and fly away that I pinned a lament titled, Dry, Static Flyaway Hair and Other Sorrows. I saw this product at a local store and whipped out my DROID and went online to check reviews. They were very good so I went ahead and bought both the shampoo and the conditioner. Let me put it this way; I was not ashamed to go out in public after the first use! I don&#x27;t know how it will be in the humidity of the South this Summer. May be too heavy. But for now, I&#x27;m loving it and the price! And I have spent way more with less results.</li>
    <li> This was on sale at my supermarket it sounded so good. I found it on Amazon and noticed the price was better and the reviews were all very good. When I ordered it along with the shampoo, I didn&#x27;t notice it was for coarse hair that needed straightening, I was too busy imagining the smell. It arrived yesterday, I gave it a try.  I have very fine hair that is completely straight. It certainly did what it was meant to do, it left my hair looking flatter than usual, but it really smelled good!</li>
    <li> My hair kept dropping by the handful, I had colored and highlighted it so much that now my hair it was embarrassing. Visiting family or friends it dropped everywhere on the table on the floor it was getting so thin and dried out my thick hair was breaking&lt;br /&gt; I bought it and tired it, the price was a little above my budget of regular shampoo price, but I decided to give it a try I taught it won’t hurt the smell was like ice cream very yummy but it caught my attention saying (nourishing) I laughed a little. I came home not expecting much but to just wash my hair hope for the best get dressed and go out to dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing it awakes your senses  smell, touch and sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It’s been about 1 months of using this product my hair is very full,I can actually run my fingers through it without it feeling  hard, it drops about just 10 strands a day if even that much.</li>
    <li> I love this line of products! The smell is delicious! I did not give this product 5 stars because this flavor is just a bit to heavy for my type of fine, over processed hair-not the products fault!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is nice but that&#x27;s about all I have to say for this conditioner. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad one but I felt like it was very watery compared to other OGX conditioners I have bought in the past. Because it was watery, it didn&#x27;t really help detangle my hair and I didn&#x27;t see an improvement in dryness.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner and the fact it comes to my door!! I have thick dry hair and it is one of the best products I have used. I even leave it in at night once a week!!</li>
    <li> I have long, straight, naturally blond hair.  It&#x27;s fine hair, but lots of it.  This is hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  Instantly relaxes hair, and a little goes a long way.  Leaves hair soft, light and tangle free.  Smells great.  Not a big fan of the shampoo, though.  I like more suds, lol.</li>
    <li> the item came just as I wanted. great product for my coarse dry hair. great value compared to in store</li>
    <li> Worst of the  OGX line. I&#x27;ll try others, but this product did not repair or moisturize at all.</li>
    <li> Good company, Organix.  Good conditioner for smooth hair.  Great smell.  I use the conditioner on the front of my hair and a deeper treatment on my ends since I have thick hair that tends to flip up at the ends.  This works great to smooth my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner yesterday to try to save my sun/heat damaged hair. What I did was use an apple cider vinegar rinse on my hair before using the conditioner. I left the conditioner on my hair for about 3 minutes and then rinsed and let it air dry over night. My hair has not felt this soft in about 4 or 5 months and it smells FANTASTIC!!! For those of you who are saying that it dried your hair out I understand. I&#x27;ve used other Organix shampoos/conditioners that have left my hair feeling like straw. I only decided to go with this one since I liked the smell and it was on sale at the time that I bought it. So if you are unsure about buying it, maybe try to catch it while its on sale. My hair is super curly and about shoulder length. Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> I usually use the moroccan argan oil in this line. I love the oil but the shampoo and conditioner seemed to dry my hair out. I ran out of the oil and went for more and saw this line and decided to try it. I am so glad I did! It is the best I have ever used. My naturally curly/dry hair immediately felt soft and smooth. I have over processed my hair and have very dry, sometimes brittle ends, and this took that stiff dry feeling away with ONE USE! My local store just happened to have a sale buy one get one for a penny so I went back and bought 2 more of each! I have finally found something that actually does what it says and it smells wonderful too. Just like all of the Organix products.</li>
    <li> I used to spend gobs of money on Joico Kpak. The consistency of this is thinner, making it easier to move through my long, thick hair. But the results parallel to KPAK.</li>
    <li> From all the negative reviews here, I&#x27;m wondering if they used the same Organix Awapuhi Conditioner that I did. I&#x27;m AA, with coarse, thick relaxed hair that hits between my shoulder blades. I decided to try the Awapuhi after I&#x27;d used the Keratin Treatment (loved it) and Coconut Conditioner (meh...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once, but honestly...the reviews? I&#x27;m shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a light pink formula that spreads easily (and evenly) over the strands once the hair is wet. It&#x27;s the first thing I noticed about it, how easy it was to apply and work through my thick hair. Feels more like a thick hair cream than a conditioner, which I like a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very particular about fragrances (seriously...I&#x27;ve thrown good conditioners away because they didn&#x27;t smell nice enough for me...like a girl&#x27;s hair should). The Awapuhi has a sweet, bubble gum scent reminiscent of bubble bath. There are some sultry base notes, too. But it&#x27;s not a bad smell at all, and not overpowering. I would even say it needed to be more fragrant....I could smell it on my hands as I conditioned, but when I rinsed, the smell was gone. Bottom line: It smells like Hawaiian Ginger. A little sweet, a little exotic, a little fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about people having rashes/allergic reactions. I would say check the ingredients before using if you have sensitive or allergy-prone skin. It&#x27;s been 6 hours and I&#x27;m fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on my hair for a few minutes while I scrubbed-up and shaved, then rinsed it out. It seemed to sink into the hair really well when it was warmed up to body temperature....I can&#x27;t wait to try it as a deep conditioning mask. And when I rinsed....WOW! Hair felt really smooth and silky. Very good for a $5.00 bottle, better results than I&#x27;ve gotten with $20.00 bottles from the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Breakage??? Again, maybe an allergy to the ingredients. I didn&#x27;t notice much, if any. Then again I didn&#x27;t use the shampoo, just the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use this again. I think its a great budget conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have thick thick hair and this shampoo and conditioner lathers and covers well and smells awesome. Highly recommend for a drug store shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to the expensive Enjoy conditioner that I had been using. I had heard good things about this line and decided to give it a try. Within two weeks of using this product, my hair started falling out more than my normal shedding and was as dry as straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One homemade coconut oil treatment and a quick order of my old standby Enjoy products, I&#x27;m hoping I can repair the damage I&#x27;ve done to my hair before my wedding in September.</li>
    <li> I love how this product smells.  It&#x27;s like a fresh fruit smoothie on my head.  The consistency seems a little thin once you spread it through your hair, but if you leave it on a few extra minutes and let it soak in, it does a decent job of moisturizing your hair.  It&#x27;s a little pricey for what it does. It&#x27;s no hair miracle, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best product by Organix I&#x27;ve found is their Coconut Milk Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine straight hair and I have never used a single conditioner from OGX that I didn&#x27;t like. This one made my hair feel soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> OGX Awapuhi Ginger Conditioner smells wonderful but does leave my hair feeling heavy and a little greasy.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of OGX brand shampoo/conditioner in general and have loved almost all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried but with thick hair that builds oil quickly, the Repairing Awapuhi Ginger conditioner just wasn&#x27;t for me.  If you have exceptionally dry hair and need a heavier, more moisturizing conditioner then this may be perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall I highly recommend the OGX brand if you&#x27;re looking for a more natural, environmentally friendly product.  They DON&#x27;T test on animals and most of their shampoos and conditioners are free of parabens, sulfates or other harsh chemicals which is great for you and for your hair.  Keep in mind, that you won&#x27;t get the silicon-ey soft feel that chemical-laden conditioners leave your hair with, but after a while your hair will be healthier and stronger on its own and less weighed down with gunk.</li>
    <li> I usually use 100% all natural products on my hair, a lot of which I make myself.  However, this is one of two products I use which are not completely natural...but my hair loves it, so I deal with the unnatural characteristics of some of the ingredients. I only use it twice a month, after using Chi protein treatment on my hair (the other unnatural product), and it really combats the dryness that usually follows a protein treatment.  I am happy with the results I get, my hair has slip and easily detangles, and dryness is not an issue. I only gave it 4 stars, not for performance, but because it is not all natural.</li>
    <li> Leaves my dry hair soft and silky. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it actually repairs hair, but it makes my damaged hair look a lot healthier. It has a really nice scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle.  Very comforting and leaves my hair soft and fragrant.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My fine, curly hair goes limp with heavy conditioners but this one makes my hair feel super glam and smells great. I get the body and moisturizing needed without the heaviness.  I have a hard time finding this in the stores...always sold out.  Now I know where I need to buy it! Sometimes you can buy a good product for a reasonable price and get the results you want....buy this conditioner.</li>
