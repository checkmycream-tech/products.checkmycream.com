<li> I thought I just had wavy hair and always blew it dry.</li>
<li> I typically was using mousse when wearing my hair curly, but after using this product using mousse will never be the same.</li>
<li> When the humidity isn&#x27;t that bad or just for a regular day I&#x27;ll use just the energizing treatment (conditioner) but for going out or when the weather is a little less cooperative, this stuff is amazing for getting my loose curls to behave and look &amp;#34;salon finished&amp;#34;</li>
<li> With other creams, some sections of my hair would droop and go flat, while other parts remained curly.  </li>
<li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair wet and crunchy looking.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I guess it tames down the naturally frizzy mass!  </li>
<li> I have thin hair strands, so it is difficult to find a product that encourages my natural waves and curls without weighing it down or feeling hard and crunchy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m also able to let it grow without having miserable tangles, frizz and frustration.  </li>
<li> It holds my curls but doesn&#x27;t get stiff like hair gel!</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> Beat cream for my hair! It holds my curls but doesn&#x27;t get stiff like hair gel! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> My wonderful hairdresser Katie Schneider told me about curlkarma  because my hair is long and thick with tight natural curls.  I could never keep it under any kind of control with any mouse or hair spray.  Now that I&#x27;ve discovered curlkarma I love my hair and get many compliments.  I&#x27;m also able to let it grow without having miserable tangles, frizz and frustration.  I bought 2 bottles the last time so I will never run out.  It maintains my hair even in our Seattle rain.    a happy Seattlite</li>
    <li> I love Curlkarma and can&#x27;t live without it. My hair stylist used this on my hair when she talked me into letting my hair dry naturally to enjoy my curls. I thought I just had wavy hair and always blew it dry. With Curlkarma I have curls and style. Your hair will have a wet look but look so fresh and natural. I now order my product from Amazon for savings and ease.</li>
    <li> A friend recently introduced me to Brocato products when she visited from Canada.  She very kindly left me with a sample tube of the Curl Energizing Cream, which I lovelovelove.  Finding products that help hold soft curls without stiffness or frizz is... well, like the holy grail of hair products.  This one fits the bill.  I use it with my John Freida products, and have had so many compliments on my curls.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  If you want soft, silk hair with manageable, non-frizzy curls, you need to try this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love Brocato hair products; they don&#x27;t contain as much chemicals as most hair products do and their good!</li>
    <li> I walk in to a beauty shop to get some product and am transitioning my hair to natural so i have two different types of texture and the lady recommend to use carmakurl, and after I apply, I roll my hair with flexy rod next day in the morning my hair feels soft, curly, afro type I love it.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair wet and crunchy looking.  It allows just the right amount of moisture for dry curls and keeps the curls bouncy and beautiful.  I used to put it in when my hair was totally wet and recently was distracted when I was getting ready and didn&#x27;t put it in until my hair was almost dry and I love it even more using it that way.</li>
    <li> I had this product given to me by a friend who had cut her hair short. I have naturally wavy hair that I am fortunate enough to be able to wear curly with product, or straighten. I typically was using mousse when wearing my hair curly, but after using this product using mousse will never be the same. You don&#x27;t have to use very much, and this gives my hair the perfect curls without even looking like you used product and being shiny or having that wet look. You will not be disappointed with this product if you are looking for beautiful natural looking curls.</li>
    <li> This product is the best.  It is non greasy, feels light and allows you to control your hair, curls go the way you want and no frizz!!</li>
    <li> I have the above.&lt;br /&gt;Day one I wash hair and put this in. I diffuse and finish with hair spray&lt;br /&gt;Day two I curl with a fat iron and I repeat for a couple of days. Gross I know but I have dry hair. This product allows for me to do this and does not build up and my hair looks fabulous because of it</li>

    <li> I have been using this with the Brocato Actives Restorative Hair Infusion and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! I have unruly curls and never know what I&#x27;m going to get from day to day. But the combination of these two products has cut the frizz down tremendously, and my curls look more uniform and just plain better. This stuff really does work better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used for curls! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just a drop of this product keeps my hair curly....and if I choose to brush it out my hair is nice and soft....</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it keeps my fine curly hair soft, though it can build up in my hair and make it feel almost oily.</li>
    <li> This product works great, but builds up in my hair. Do not want to use a clarifying shampoo to get it out because it will also take some color out.</li>
    <li> I buy curl stuff for my curly head girl and this is what she likes.  It&#x27;s expensive, but I guess it tames down the naturally frizzy mass!  Arrived really fast.</li>
    <li> Really helps my hair stay soft and curly. I will keep using this product on a daily basis. Will keep ordering it from Amazon.</li>
