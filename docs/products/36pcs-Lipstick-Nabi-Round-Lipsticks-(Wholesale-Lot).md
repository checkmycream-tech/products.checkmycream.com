      <li>I definitely recommend these! :D</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely better on swatch.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many things from Nabi Cosmetics</li>
      <li>but still you can do better with like a NYX brand for dirt</li>
      <li>OMG, I love these lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these lipsticks.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay as well.</li>
      <li>Love them wished it came with the stand</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>You get more for buck here.</li>
      <li>There are many colors that I end up not using and there are still some colors that I would like to have and are not there (purplish colors).</li>
      <li>daughters love it though</li>
      <li>I love the lipsticks, the problem is I have so many</li>
      <li>Not that pigmented but they do stain your lips which I believe is better.</li>
      <li>but still you can do better with like a NYX brand for dirt</li>
      <li>My wife love them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay as well.</li>
      <li>Everyone and myself love them.</li>
      <li>I read many comments regarding the rotating acrylic lipstick display stand not coming with the lipsticks.  </li>
      <li>I  LOVE  </li>
      <li>So I was really pleased they are in the U.S., and I didn&#x27;t have to order it from another country where it would take forever to receive it.</li>
      <li>Also the lipsticks (most of them) was stuck in the cap, so you have to spin the lipstick container until the lipstick gets lose, or else it will stay stuck in the cap and will get lose from the containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good quality, packaging of the lipstick itself is very nice and the lipstick itself is creamy, soft and looks so good when you put it on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not only cheap!!!!</li>
      <li>I think the quality is ok for the price, the lipsticks are pretty good.</li>
      <li>this is a nice set if you like dark colors also it&#x27;s not the best quality</li>
      <li>(Two days after purchase) great vibrant colors.with a glossy shine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Copper: There is a light smell, nothing strong, kind of smelled burnt.</li>
      <li>and so i expected it to be perfect.</li>
      <li>The price is extremely reasonable, and the quality is surprisingly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everything was in good condition and lipstick are very pigmented and glide on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>The tops don&#x27;t stay on and the lipstick breaks easily</li>
      <li>They are pretty amazing for there price</li>
      <li>Hands down best buy</li>
      <li>it shows pretty good but not too much !!</li>
      <li>I have never had such cheap lipstick be so great.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re moisturizing, smooth, and don&#x27;t look cheapy.</li>
      <li>Some of the light colors didn&#x27;t look like the ones in the picture</li>
      <li>The color itself is a burnt orange, light tho.</li>
      <li>the fact that you get so many colors makes this that much more fun and worth the price</li>
      <li>Good quality colors but too many similar colors.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not too light on my skin tone and not too dark although I would have liked a darker gold (which is why I picked this set out of the others because of my quest to find a good gold color.)</li>
      <li>I was really excited about these but will not be buying anymore of</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about these but will not be buying anymore of</li>
      <li>Each have a unique color and name.</li>
      <li>I honestly feel this color would be better suited for lighter skin tones or dark skin women who are okay</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So loving these awesome colors nice and silky smooth on lips.</li>
    <li> Some of the light colors didn&#x27;t look like the ones in the picture</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was surprised in the quality of the lipsticks based on the cost. However this is a great buy I&#x27;ve tried on about 3 or  4 colors and I&#x27;m loving it so far. I would definitely recommend to a friend I actually bought a set for a friend for a Christmas gift. Hands down best buy I&#x27;ve came across in a while definite thumbs up.</li>
    <li> There was a lot of different colors, and its fun to have so many colors to chose from.</li>
    <li> They are pretty amazing for there price I reccomend for anyou lipstick addict like myself who is on a budget. You get all colors you need maybe a couple doubles but who doesn&#x27;t need more pink in their lives!  Absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> My grandmother was very satisfied and happy with her gift!</li>
    <li> this is a nice set if you like dark colors also it&#x27;s not the best quality</li>
    <li> Nice shades, happy with purchase</li>
    <li> The price and the number of lipsticks are very attractive. I think the quality is ok for the price, the lipsticks are pretty good. There are many colors that I end up not using and there are still some colors that I would like to have and are not there (purplish colors).</li>
    <li> Love them wished it came with the stand</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she was disappointed to learn that the display case was not included.  It came in quite a few little boxes with 6 lipsticks in each one.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! I was soooo scared to buy this because it&#x27;s 36 lipsticks for 30 bucks!!! I&#x27;m so glad I ended up doing it, though! It&#x27;s not only cheap!!!! But GREAT quality. I&#x27;m so excited. I have never had such cheap lipstick be so great. I&#x27;m not an artist, but I&#x27;m a makeup lover. And these are amazing. They came early, too! Only complaint is out of all 36 colors, there was no nude lipstick :( But the colors I did get were awesome. I definitely recommend these! :D</li>
    <li> Love them. Each have a unique color and name. No repeats. Not that pigmented but they do stain your lips which I believe is better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a  hard to please person when it comes to anything especially makeup.  With that being said as a brown skinned woman I  LOVE  THESE LIPSTICKS!  All of them look great with my skin color.  It was amazing to hear my husband say he loved them on me as he strongly dislikes lipstick period. Only two were repeat  colors  of which I didn&#x27;t mind at all.  I&#x27;ve recommended  this brand to all my friends.  Mine didn&#x27;t come with a weird smell  at all.</li>
    <li> nice set for the$$$! smooth feel on lips, nice colors! happy with it all around...would recommend this to save $ !</li>
    <li> Not very opaque and doesnt last long, but great range of colors.</li>
    <li> So I am a makeup addict. I saw these and I was skeptical, because I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand and the price seemed to good to be true. Well I received these back in 2013 still use them today. They are very pigmented, the color is exactly as you&#x27;d expect, It&#x27;s long lasting, and it moisturizes your lips. I apply this lipstick Once before going out and it stays on all night, but if I&#x27;m planning on going to a dinner where I&#x27;d mostly be eating and drinking I just apply the matching lip liners and it stays on no problem.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are amazing! I was a little skeptical and on edge about buying these, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! They&#x27;re moisturizing, smooth, and don&#x27;t look cheapy. The only thing is that you have to re-apply it a few times throughout the day, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with carrying one in your purse. ;)</li>
    <li> This does not come with the stand . I was not happy about that but the lipsticks and eyeliners are nice .</li>
    <li> I actually got this for Christmas presents. Everyone and myself love them. They use them often as well.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with my purchase. I got 36 lipsticks for a great price. The lipstick goes on super soft, silky, smooth. Not a dry lipstick like others I&#x27;ve tried and stays on for a pretty long time. I&#x27;ve bought many things from Nabi Cosmetics and i haven&#x27;t been disappointed once.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of lipsticks.  I was a little disappointed that some of the lipsticks had touched against the cap and were a little smooshed, but it wasn&#x27;t bad.  There are a lot of different colors...some with very opaque coverage and others with a more sheer look.  Some colors are made for dark skin and don&#x27;t go well with my fair complexion, but that&#x27;s to be expected in a large group like this. Not sure why black is included...I don&#x27;t know anyone that wears this other than 14 year olds and people for halloween.</li>
    <li> I was shocked by how creamy, vibrant, and pigmented these lipsticks were.  I rebuilt my makeup collection recently, and this set was one of my first purchases.  The price is extremely reasonable, and the quality is surprisingly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this set.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing deal! If you count how much you are paying per lipstick, it is a steal!  Looked grate when I got it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good quality, packaging of the lipstick itself is very nice and the lipstick itself is creamy, soft and looks so good when you put it on. Colors are great, none of them are too bright or weird.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably good deal!</li>
    <li> While the lipsticks are very good, no trouble with them. Very good product. I read many comments regarding the rotating acrylic lipstick display stand not coming with the lipsticks.  I search the internet to find a place that could actually custom make one for me that is similar to the Nabi stand. Guess what, I found one! The company name is Dan Displays. The website is www.dandisplays4u.com or you can call them at 1-888-295-4326. The guys name is Steve. Nice folks, and they are located in Georgia. So I was really pleased they are in the U.S., and I didn&#x27;t have to order it from another country where it would take forever to receive it. You can either order what you want on-line or call them and tell them what size you want, and he can actually custom make the size display stand you want for a affordable price. Yeah! He also has different sizes listed as well under cosmetic displays. Check them out and no I don&#x27;t work for them. I just thought I would share this information because like many of you, I read your comments about being disappointed in not getting the stand either as I was when my fiance got me the lipsticks and thought the stand came with it. I hope this information helps. Thanks</li>
    <li> Lipsticks are good ,but there was NO Display like the Pic, Very Disappointed</li>
    <li> This product has soooooo many different shades of lipsticks to choose from. Sometimes it takes me half an hour to choose what lipstick I want to use! lol. The only downside would have to be that there are a lot of the same colors. There&#x27;s like 10 browns and even though they are all different shades and look different, I wish they would have mixed it up and put some purple or blue or some things that people wear for certain occasions. Also, there could be different textures (matte, shiny, glitter, etc.)</li>
    <li> Shipment was great. However the actual product is low quality.</li>
    <li> these were better than i expected.  very opaque and has awesome color payoff.  I highly recommend if you are on a budget.  You get more for buck here.</li>
    <li> yes the 36-pc lipstick was great i can forever be using all of the different colors all are the colors any woman would wear on different occasions fairly i exspir...with all the colors- #1wine,#2cinnamon-a golden copper i would say chocolate-dark copper i would say w/t neutral light,#4baby pink sunrise,rust,#nutmeg,#orange,#lavender,#morning coffe,#dark brown,#mocha,#rose beige,#angela off pink w/t a little sheer,#cabaret,#amy,#pink rose,#light pink,#copper,#cocoa,#toast,#lilac-very sheer warm pink,#spice-golden light coffer w/t creamer i would say,#honey-warm hue of orange or warm sheer dark rust,#red brown warm color,sun-light,#pink pearl-the lightest pink,#mauve,#sea pearl-the sheer-est pink,#plum wine,#burnt sugar-a glossy dark-berry color i would say,</li>
    <li> Does not come with the stand and looks like some are repeated colors</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why you guys are whining about not getting the stand it clearly says in the features&amp;details that the stand is not included .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get the exact colors shown in the listing #Upset,.😖😖😖 I have no black (I really wanted the black) it comes on wet like carmaxx&#x27; it shows pretty good but not too much !! I like the different colors but its mainly pink red brown and slight orange !!!, for future reference list what buyers will receive other then that its okay !!! I bought the bundle of 36 kinda glad I didn&#x27;t go for the 60 if you like wet lipstick this the brand for you !! 💋💋💋</li>
    <li> This is a great value with an awesome product! It even was delivered two weeks early!! (Two days after purchase) great vibrant colors.with a glossy shine. Must have definatly if you are a beauty supply lover !!!! 😀</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lipsticks.  These are the first lipsticks I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I was hesitant at first because I&#x27;d heard that lipsticks could be drying and could be very uncomfortable, but these go on like chap stick and look absolutely wonderful with a clear or lightly pigmented lip gloss.  (I suggest the Nabi 10 piece lip gloss that I purchased.  They are just as pigmented and are very nice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to address the problems that a lot of people have with the product.  There are a few colors that don&#x27;t go with my skin tone, but out of the batch, I can use about 30 of them and can regularly use about 20.  There was one lipstick that had gotten stuck to the top of the container, but it was easy to pop back in and it&#x27;s one of the ones that I use regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a lot bigger than they look in the picture and the lipstick is very easy to get on.  I have to say that it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while.  They don&#x27;t melt easily, they don&#x27;t smudge very much, and they feel like burt&#x27;s bees on your lips.</li>
    <li> Sigh! Some of the colors stay on the lips whilst others just run right off or doesn&#x27;t stay at all. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the lipsticks, the problem is I have so many, I don&#x27;t know what I have.</li>
    <li> Items were not as described.</li>
    <li> Good quality colors but too many similar colors.</li>
    <li> last long, flexible and so so easy to use. the fact that you get so many colors makes this that much more fun and worth the price</li>
    <li> I love the different types of selection you have with these lip sticks. The only problem I had with some of them is when you opened the lips sticks they fall out, or smudged the top. I am guessing the reason for this is because they weren&#x27;t sealed down in the bottom of holder, or it could have melted on the delivery ride.</li>
    <li> they are very nice and rich in colors. the only thing that I wished to have the stand with it, LoooooL</li>
    <li> I loved these lipsticks except some weren&#x27;t as dark as I thought they would be but overall they are good</li>
    <li> Well Instead of purchasing the whole lot I purchased one of the 5 piece sets that they offer from this (you don&#x27;t have to get the whole 36 piece, you can do 5 piece sets)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the: Copper, Spice, Dark Gold, Shining Pink, and Cabaret- I&#x27;ll break down each of the colors. I&#x27;m darkskinned but the way so you can apply my description of the colors to a skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copper: There is a light smell, nothing strong, kind of smelled burnt. The color itself is a burnt orange, light tho. It&#x27;s very soft on the application but had to do a few swipes to get the color. Not bad. *This would look good on any skin tone really&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spice: Very deceiving. Very Sheer/shiny almost metallic gold/white. One swipe of color is good enough. *I honestly feel this color would be better suited for lighter skin tones or dark skin women who are okay wearing such a chalky yet shiny color. Or it could wash them out. Do not like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Gold: This should have been &amp;#34;Just Gold&amp;#34;...it&#x27;s not too light on my skin tone and not too dark although I would have liked a darker gold (which is why I picked this set out of the others because of my quest to find a good gold color.) It&#x27;s subtle and cute. The pigment isn&#x27;t great but with a liner this could be nice for a natural day of makeup with just a little color that&#x27;s not too bold but visible. *I think on lighter skin tones, this would wash out but with a liner it can  be salvaged. I will keep it and play around with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shining Pink: Horrible, I have a pink from the dollar store that has better pigment than this. It is indeed very shiny and sheer pink. I do not like very much. I needed to apply it heavily to see any real color. It&#x27;s definitely better on swatch. *This is one that would only work on a lighter skin tone because one swipe would give just enough color to gloss the lips, for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to wear lipstick much but likes a little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cabaret: I was hoping this one would be good. It&#x27;s okay as well. It needed a heavy application to see some color but once it was applied I liked the subtly of it. I have better burgundy colored lipsticks but on days when I am just running errands and don&#x27;t wanna waste my good lipsticks I will wear this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT: ARE THEY WORTH IT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes and No. If you are like me and LOVE Lipstick have plenty of different brands and colors then NO. If you are like me, you care about the pigment and wear of the lipstick and these although quite inexpensive for 5, is not worth it. I have my Maybelline brands for my everyday lipstick and they are well worth the $5s for one vs the price and lack of quality of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not like me then what the heck, why not get a great deal. They are nice light colors, doable for a simple lipstick but still you can do better with like a NYX brand for dirt cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the 5 colors I can see myself wearing two of them regularly (which is like a few times a month but I change my lipsticks daily) I was really excited about these but will not be buying anymore of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I helped you to decide.uld be good.

    <li> In love With all of the colors but the gold, it came broken and absolutely no pigment. Wouldn&#x27;t even be a good top color. But the black is amazing!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. A lot of different colors. Feel really soft on the lips. Definatly worth it if you like variety in lip wear.</li>
    <li> Pictures is misrepresentative, comes without the case.  You get plain white boxes of lipstick.  Something like 5 boxes with 6 lipsticks or whatever and even breakdown is.  Right now I don&#x27;t exactly remember.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of smooth colors.</li>
    <li> I bought the product for my Daughter, she love it and it was a fast delivery</li>
    <li> 3 stars because it is missing my lipstick stand...</li>
    <li> OMG, I love these lipsticks. They are creamy and vibrant. There&#x27;s nothing of this quality at this price. If you&#x27;re a MUA or looking to gift a cosmetics lover for the holidays. This is hands down a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Bad, if i could give u zero starts i would, i didn&#x27;t like it, some of the lipsticks were damaged and smushed. I also thought it came with the display, if it did not come with the display a picture of it should not have been there. That was the most i ever spent on lipstick and so i expected it to be perfect. But it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love them but was a bit disappointed because I thought it was more of a actual lipstick but other than that I love the colors and are good quality (:</li>
    <li> She liked some of them, some she didn&#x27;t. Some were loose but easily pushed back in... I wish it had come with the carousel.</li>
    <li> The shipping was two weeks faster than it said it would be. So I was really happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read through the site so regarding not getting the display was no suprise.&lt;br /&gt;BUT not getting all the colors that they show made me very disappointed, (I DID get 36 diffrent colors, so no mistake there,) I got some colors that was not in the photos instead. So I didn&#x27;t get one of the lipsticks I really wanted, which sucks.&lt;br /&gt;  I got many darker lipsticks instead of pink shades. I did notice that the lipsticks (that were right) was darker in real life than in the photos (It can be my computer just showing them as lighter, not sure) But just so YOU as a buyer have that in mind, depending on the settings on your computer the color can be diffrent.&lt;br /&gt;  Also the lipsticks (most of them) was stuck in the cap, so you have to spin the lipstick container until the lipstick gets lose, or else it will stay stuck in the cap and will get lose from the containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s a good deal, the colors are nice and the lipsticks are easy and smooth to use.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t regret buying this, I just wished that the seller could be more clear that it could be a differens in colors in real life or that you may get other colors that are shown in the photos.</li>
    <li> I loooveee these so much the only problem is it had the double of some colors and didnt have certain colora tbat itsaid it had  but the lipsticks are cute colors and they are so soft on your lips!</li>
    <li> present for my daughters,  lots of colors to choose from but small amount of lipstick in each tube.  approx 40% of a normal size lipstick.  daughters love it though so i guess its all good.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Wife loves it</li>
    <li> Loved this set, very smooth and creamy.  Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Awsome out of 36 only two double colors.</li>
    <li> The tops don&#x27;t stay on and the lipstick breaks easily</li>
    <li> There are some colors that I love in here, like natural and spice, and then there are some that are way too sheer. As far as how it looks on your lips, it depends. Some make your lips look very dry and some are very nice. There are some colors that look exactly the same but have different names. I probably use and like 15 of the 36 lipsticks which still isn&#x27;t too bad. By the way, the lipstick stand does NOT come with it.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Everything was in good condition and lipstick are very pigmented and glide on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Great buy I would recommend for any lipstick lovers out there</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are abouslty amazing , one coat and the color stays on &amp; last all day. The lipsticks are just like the description. Perfect! I will be ordering these again &amp; I hope I influence you as well. &amp; shipping was great! I got my items a WEEK A HEAD OF TIME. Great product &amp; excellent service.</li>
    <li> Does it come with the lipstick stand thing too</li>
    <li> These are very nice lipsticks. My wife love them.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter. There are several duplicate colors. the lipstick does not come with the carousel, which was a big disappointment.</li>
