      <li>After purchasing the Clarifying Toner and absolutely loving it, I had to buy the rest of the routine.</li>
      <li>Thanks Dr. Hauschka for making a great product!</li>
      <li>I think the idea is that this really good clean oil replaces your own oil which is rising to the surface.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is mild and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>the product is good, it was suppose to get fully absorbed into the skin</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for many many years</li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried these</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I use just one squirt of the oil in the morning and again when I get home from work, being sure to wash my face before each application.  </li>
      <li>My mom has used Dr. H&#x27;s products for many years.  </li>
      <li>It does not make your skin more oily.</li>
      <li>Love, love this formula.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more of them.</li>
      <li>This oil is amazing, as a man i used it a couple of times and no more irritation of shaving(don&#x27;t worry, not as a shaving oil but moisturizer :), it&#x27;s really wonderful.</li>
      <li>This is a great line of natural products.</li>
      <li>However, this turned out to be the BEST mosturizer I have ever used; much better than any oil-free/non-comedogenic product I&#x27;ve previously tried.</li>
      <li>The homeopathic principle really is true!</li>
      <li>I like how it&#x27;s easy to apply in my skin.</li>
      <li>I also wasn&#x27;t too keen on the strong herbal/botanical scents both this oil and the toner have.</li>
      <li>Because of this, I know I am going through a bottle much more quickly than I am supposed to.  </li>
      <li>, it sounds a little cooked up to me, but this product is just wonderful night or day.</li>
      <li>It might take a few weeks for your skin to fully normalize itself but keep using it until it does and you will be very happy.</li>
      <li>I use the oil day and night and it has made my skin so smooth.  </li>
      <li>Too rich for my face though.</li>
      <li>My face has significantly cleared up, and I no longer get break outs for a week every month.</li>
      <li>Works great with dry skin as well!</li>
      <li>I like the almond oil more &amp; can use it on my whole body.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if their line added an ingredient that wasn&#x27;t 100% natural,</li>
      <li>I am considering the other Dr. Hauschka products, despite the price because I am extremely happy with the oil.</li>
      <li>Using this with other Dr. Hauschka products has kept my face in great condition even as I age.</li>
      <li>her face is super oily.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommand Dr. Hauschka skin care, indeed it&#x27;s one of the most respected company in the beauty industry.</li>
      <li>After the first day of using this normalizing oil I saw a huge difference.</li>
      <li>This is the only true product ive found for my face love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s a lot of money to spend, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>First, this product actually does moisturize while it &#x27;normalized&#x27; your own oil production.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product in hopes of moving towards a more natural system.</li>
      <li>Who knows how much money I have sunk into just trying to have clear, healthy</li>
      <li>My wife is like it very much in two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I just wish I had this as a teen, instead of wasting all my money on harsh products that did more damage to my skin and esteem than good.</li>
      <li>forward to LAST WEEK, I decided to try out Dr. Hauschka products after seeing many product reviews about them on You Tube.  </li>
      <li>This is my second bottle, love this.  </li>
      <li>After buying so many oil-free moisturizers, I actually bought an oil to put on my face.</li>
      <li>And now I&#x27;m red as a tomato on most days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m somewhat glad to see that I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t meet my expectation,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for years with acne and scarring from acne so I&#x27;ve tried a number of products. Proactiv, Murad, DDF, Peter Thomas Roth to name a few. I came across Dr. Hauschka and decided to try the sample kit. I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of how to apply the products (press and roll) because I wasn&#x27;t accustomed to it. However, it&#x27;s made me slow down and now I enjoy my daily facial care routine.     Anyway, the breakout star was the normalizing day oil. My skin looked hydrated, my pores looked smaller, the spots dulled then went away. I love it. I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for years because it&#x27;s so expensive but I always come back to it. Just use a few drops, otherwise you&#x27;ll be very shiny.The only other thing that clears my skin is birth control pills (TMI?)</li>
    <li> The previous reviewer said that the Essential Oil worked for her acne. I find it it so wonderful that the same product was the only product I could turn to this winter when my skin turned really dry and scaly. It is a miracle product.     Don&#x27;t be dismayed by the way it looks...it is very oily and orange in the bottle. You only need to apply a drop or two. I was introduced to this product when I insisted to a Dr. Hauschka specialist that I wanted something to put on my face at night occasionally. Keep in mind that Dr. Hauschka recommends typically putting nothing on your face at night. The theory is that your skin needs this downtime to recover. The essential oil is meant to be applied in the morning when your own facial skin oils are supposed to be regenerating. I think the idea is that this really good clean oil replaces your own oil which is rising to the surface. I don&#x27;t know, it sounds a little cooked up to me, but this product is just wonderful night or day. Your skin absorbs it despite its apparent oiliness.     For the record, I also use Dr. Hauschka Quince Cream, Toned Day Cream, Natural Moisturizer and Bronzed Toner which you mix in your palm with a spot of the moisturizer. I am also a fan of their Neem Oil hair treatment. The Blackthorn Oil is also great for massages. Oh, and every night I use their milk cleanser followed by a dab of their eye cream. This is a great line of natural products.</li>
    <li> This product when used with the Toner helps prevent black heads! Works great with dry skin as well! Great product!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing, as a man i used it a couple of times and no more irritation of shaving(don&#x27;t worry, not as a shaving oil but moisturizer :), it&#x27;s really wonderful. It&#x27;s oil but lightweight so you won&#x27;t feel your pores clogged. I highly recommand Dr. Hauschka skin care, indeed it&#x27;s one of the most respected company in the beauty industry. It&#x27;s expensive( costs less in Switzerland, less expensive than Clinique !) but on the other hand 1 ounce lasts at least 4-5 months !</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month now (along with the cleansing milk and clarifying toner) and I love it! It is definitely an oily substance, but it really does not make your skin oily. It has actually made my skin LESS oily! The homeopathic principle really is true! My skin is clearer and smoother and fresher, but not oilier. And you only need a tiny bit, so it will last a long time, very worth the money. I don&#x27;t know of another moisturizer like it for oily/combination skin.</li>
    <li> I put this on my forehead every morning and it really does help balance my skin.  I feel a lot less &#x27;greasy&#x27; at the end of the day.  Love it.  :)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Good price.  Quality product. Too rich for my face though.</li>
    <li> The product itself it really great! My face feels more moisturized and a lot smoother now.   My issue with this product is more of the delivery, the pump leaks continuously. Albeit slowly, but over the course of using it, I estimate that I&#x27;ve lost a considerable amount of the oil on my counter. Considering the price of this product, I would like to see improvement of the delivery system.   I know that the vendor is just a distributor, but perhaps they can reflect my comment to the manufacturer?</li>
    <li> I too love this product!  I hate myself for not trying Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products sooner. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks but can&#x27;t imagine life without it.  In general my skin looks better overall.  I can&#x27;t believe how much better in such a short amount of time.  My skin absorbs the day oil very well.  It did irritate my skin the first few days that I used it, but lucky for me I continued giving it a chance to adjust.  My pores are smaller, the skin looks extremly smooth, it looks younger and supple.  Amazing products.  My faves are the cleansing cream, day oil, and clarifying toner.  Also like the cleansing mask and steam bath.</li>
    <li> The only oil that keeps my mixed facial skin balanced, fights blemishes and inflammation. Gives my skin a healthy glow and helps my skin reflects the ligth beautifully.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to write reviews like this because I genuinely like the product, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t do as advertised. As a moisturizer, this stuff is great. A pleasant citrus aroma and a formula that leaves a very clean and refreshed feeling after application. However, I have horribly oily skin and did not feel like this \\&quot;normalized\\&quot; my oiliness at all. It actually seemed to contribute to the oiliness, especially on my t-zone areas, and putting make-up over it was just a very unpleasant thought. It&#x27;s also a bit awkward to apply. The oil is pretty thick, so applying it straight to your face would not only have you pulling at your skin but also result in a veritable oil slick. So instead, I put a small amount in my hand, add a few drops of water, rub my hands together, and lightly pat on. You can tell by the feel of it that it&#x27;s a nice, quality product. I still gave it four stars because I do like it...just don&#x27;t put too much stock into the \\&quot;normalizing\\&quot; portion of the description. I prefer using it during winter months, when sections of my skin are prone to dryness, or treat it as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the Clarifying Toner and absolutely loving it, I had to buy the rest of the routine. The Normalizing Day Oil lived up to my expectations. After buying so many oil-free moisturizers, I actually bought an oil to put on my face. I couldn&#x27;t believe myself! But the like-treats-like philosophy must be working, because this oil seems to draw out the oil from my skin. After a week of using this product, my skin looks balanced and supple with an even tone and color. If it had an SPF my life would be complete!     A word about the SPF thing actually. So Dr. Hauschka stopped the production of their sunscreens because the SPF they provided wasn&#x27;t high enough and some new thing in Europe made it impossible. Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if their line added an ingredient that wasn&#x27;t 100% natural, AS LONG AS THEY DIDN&#x27;T USE NANO TECHNOLOGY! There&#x27;s no HARM a non-natural ingredient could do, unless it used the dreaded nano technology! PLEASE. MAKE A SUNSCREEN. If you won&#x27;t add them to the moisturizers, then make it on it&#x27;s own, with directions to mix a little with your moisturizer, and people who are bothered by it don&#x27;t have to buy it.    So. This product has lost a star from me because of the lack of SPF and the price. Overall, recommended.    -Daughter of Katy C. Ameglio</li>
    <li> This heals that flaky miniature dandruff that forms around my eyebrows.  It feels really good all day.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Wonderful company.  A little goes a long long way!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about trying this product since I&#x27;m already prone to break outs, especially hormonal acne. It seemed a little counter-intuitive to apply oil to my face when it&#x27;s already oily and easily clogged. However, this turned out to be the BEST mosturizer I have ever used; much better than any oil-free/non-comedogenic product I&#x27;ve previously tried. My face has significantly cleared up, and I no longer get break outs for a week every month.</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and have had consistent face acne throughout my life.  After having a really bad break-out for a couple months and trying everything I could think of, I decided to try the Normalizing Day Oil.  I have been using the oil for a month now and it is wonderful!  I use just one squirt of the oil in the morning and again when I get home from work, being sure to wash my face before each application.  I have always avoided oil products for my face, but this is really amazing.  It does not leave my face oily and I believe it has helped lighten my acne scars.  My only complaint is the bottle - I&#x27;m not sure if my bottle is faulty, but it leaks (a lot) around where the top meets the glass bottle.  Because of this, I know I am going through a bottle much more quickly than I am supposed to.  Hopefully the next bottle I purchase will not be like this, otherwise I will need to come up with some type of bottle solution (that is how much I really like this product).  There is a light fragrance, but it is very pleasant, even my husband likes it.  Note: I also purchased the Moisturizing Day Cream, as my skin could be considered combination skin.  The lotion leaves my face a bit oily, so I have decided to use just the oil for now.  Come winter, I may mix the two a little to compensate for my winter dry skin.  Thanks Dr. Hauschka for making a great product!</li>
    <li> The bottle lasted me 10 months - I use it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been amazing for my skin. So expensive but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin does not feel oily but soft and glowing when I use it.</li>
    <li> I using for 5 years and i love it, My skin look great</li>
    <li> My skin has been acne prone, but this did not work for me. I broke out terribly. I could only use it for three days and things got so bad I had to d/c</li>
    <li> One day I you tubed oily face, and this girl swore by this product.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to take a chance to do some research, and in my mind I swore it would be waste of time because every other product I have tried to use was a waste of money. I was skeptical about oil on oily skin, but to my amazement, it combated my oily skin and it helped reduce my pores. My left side of the face had skin damage from prior acne. The pours seemed to be getting big, almost like crater type skin. After the first day of using this normalizing oil I saw a huge difference. I joked with my cousin in Toronto that my face looks 5 years younger!&lt;br /&gt; I am considering the other Dr. Hauschka products, despite the price because I am extremely happy with the oil. I just wish I had this as a teen, instead of wasting all my money on harsh products that did more damage to my skin and esteem than good. I love Dr.Hauschka products...it is the TOP NOTCH product for my oily skin, and honestly has helped me not to shy away from embarrassment. If anything it has given me my youth back.</li>
    <li> Love, love this formula.  I have combo-sensitive skin and other moisturizers tend to be sticky or feel too thick on my skin.  I love to mix this with a little translucent bronze concentrate (softens scar tissue and blends discoloration).  In warmer weather, I mix a few drops of the clarifying oil with a pea size amount of aloe vera-blends very well and goes on smooth. Mild and wonderful smell from nutritive plant oils!</li>
    <li> This product makes you rethink oily skin.  I was afraid to use, as I thought more oil could only make things worse on my already oily skin.  I was amazed!  My skin is so clear and pore have shrunk!  Thank you Dr. H!</li>
    <li> Holy cow.  I can echo all the other reviewers who say they have tried everything.  For me this includes prescription medications, the Obagi line, accutane, laser resurfacing, and every high end over the counter line on planet earth.  Who knows how much money I have sunk into just trying to have clear, healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So two things.  First, this product actually does moisturize while it &#x27;normalized&#x27; your own oil production.  I had recently gone to the eucarin super intensive therapy stuff, it is thicker than paste.  I was at my wits end, with combination acne/oily skin that flaked.  Even when using this incredibly thick lotion, it felt like it sat on top of my skin and I still got flaky and oily.  After a while, your skin hurts.  One application of the normalizing oil, and I said &#x27;ahhhhh&#x27;.  Hours later it was still, &#x27;ahhhh&#x27;.  Days later, thank goodness I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second.  My mom has used Dr. H&#x27;s products for many years.  When she was in her 20&#x27;s she lived in Korea and taught English.  She said the women had the most beautiful skin there, and all they did was wash their face every day at the well with OLIVE OIL.  Yes, olive oil.  I think it is a similar concept to the Normalizing Day Oil.  So, I am going to take this one step further.  Shu Umuera is an old makeup artist who makes a series of cleansing oils.  I am going to try those as well.  I should have listened to my mom 20 years ago when she suggested I try the oils.  Ah well.  Better late than never.</li>
    <li> Very effective product. Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> the product is good, it was suppose to get fully absorbed into the skin but it didnt, it does leave the face a bit shiny a slightly oily.</li>
    <li> I let my mom borrow it because I really like it and her face is super oily.  She wanted to keep it for awhile, but I wouldn&#x27;t let her because I love this stuff!  This oil actually keeps my face from getting oily!  I used to use really harsh toners and then see beads of oil  appear on my skin.  I never thought that applying oil could prevent that and that less oil production would lead to clearer skin (less blackheads).  I put it on every morning and evening.  Since you only use a teeny bit, it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Never need to use blotting sheets anymore. This product has totally helped my oily skin. No breakouts either!! Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, love this.  I have oily/combination acne prone skin. I use two to three drops and my makeup sits on top of it perfectly. Dr. Hauschka products are the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and oily skin my entire life, it&#x27;s in my genes. I&#x27;ve been in and out of dermatologist&#x27;s offices since I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve been on just about every topical cream you can mention, and I&#x27;ve been on a regimine of antibiotics and two regimines of Accutane. Nothing \\&quot;cured\\&quot; my skin. My doctor now thinks I have rosacea! Great... just great...   I&#x27;ve tried just about every skin care product on the market, the expensive stuff and the not-so-expensive stuff. All-natural stuff, organic stuff, stuff loaded with chemicals, clay masks, salicylic acid, tea-tree oil, benzoyl peroxide. I&#x27;ve tried eliminating foods from my diet, drinking tons of water... dietary supplements, vitamins. nothing has ever really helped in the long term.   Anyway, having just turned 40, I thought my pimple problems would be over. What 40-year old do you know has pimples??? Me :( I get little pimples all over my forehead (and now spreading down to my neck, for goodness sake!) and the occaisional \\&quot;white head.\\&quot; And now I&#x27;m red as a tomato on most days. The winter is the worst. I&#x27;ve been at my wits end for months now. I get so frustrated with my skin I wind up scrubbing all over, which I know you&#x27;re not supposed to do as it only makes it even oilier still.  By chance, I just heard about this product while researching Halloween costumes on Instructibles.com. Random, I know--right? After I saw this girl&#x27;s video, I thought \\&quot;What the heck, I&#x27;ll try it. It&#x27;s just so crazy, it might work.\\&quot;   After just TWO days my skin is noticeably better. I am still a bit red in the T-zone, but the little pimples have started to clear up and I don&#x27;t have that shiny, shiny face anymore. When I touch my face I can feel a slight amount of oil on my skin but my face doesn&#x27;t look oily. I don&#x27;t know if this is going to be the cure-all I&#x27;ve been praying for but I think the logic behind it makes so much more sense than everything else I&#x27;ve tried. Instead of stripping away oils, which makes your body produce even more--counteract it by putting oil on topically! This convinces my body that I don&#x27;t need anymore! (This is just my guess). It&#x27;s like sending a memo to my skin saying \\&quot;It&#x27;s all good... no need to send more--we&#x27;ve got enough, thanks!\\&quot; plus the Day Oil has lots of good-for-you things in it too so hopefully it will start fixing my skin.  I know it&#x27;s a lot of money to spend, but it&#x27;s worth it. Two-three drops is all you&#x27;ll probably need and this little bottle will probably last a very, very long time. Think about all the stuff you bought and threw away. If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve probably spent lots of time, hope and money on skin care stuff that never worked and you just gave it away or threw it away.   Based on the other reviews, I think this is the solution we&#x27;ve all be waiting for...</li>
    <li> I used to use proactive products to cleanse my oily skin to minimize breakouts.  I got fed up with my clothes turning different colors when I washed my face cloths in the same load of laundry and started looking for a more natural products.  Shortly thereafter Dr. Hauschka products were used for a facial and I was sold!  I also use the cleansing cream, and clarifying toner twice a day.  In the morning I use this oil.  Apparently, the natural oil helps control your own natural oil production.  Voila, clear skin at last without all the chemicals!  This bottle will last a year because you only use a small amount.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. According to all the great reviews, it must work on a lot of people with combination or oily skin. It&#x27;s marketed for \\&quot;oily, impure\\&quot; skin. So, I gave this a try, along with the normalizing toner, but it made me breakout the first time I used it. However, being an optimist, and since I spent so much on it and read the rave reviews, I thought maybe I should be patient, to see if my skin was just clearing out and adjusting to it. Nope! After over a month of use and repeated breakouts, I tossed both products in the garbage. I also wasn&#x27;t too keen on the strong herbal/botanical scents both this oil and the toner have.</li>
    <li> love this - it is expensive but it works to control oil which at first seems counter-intuitive as you are putting oil on an oily face but it has stopped breakouts. Pricey but worth it. The only complaint I have is with the pour spout - too much of the pricey oil is lost as it has a tiny hole to get the oil out of and some runs down the sides. Needs a better spout! It is a 5 star product in a 5 star glass container with a 1 star spout.</li>
    <li> After YEARS of dealing with super oily skin and trying dozens of products to fix it, i stumbled upon this wonderful skin care brand Dr. Hauschka. I have to admit like most people who&#x27;ve tried it, putting oil on your face when your dealing with oily skin seems to be very odd but the principal behind it seemed sound. I bought this along with the Cleasning Cream and Toner as recommended on their website for people dealing with oily skin and after about 2 weeks i&#x27;ve noticed my skin has normalized its oil production. I used to get oily skin 1 hour after washing my face and now i can go all day without noticing my face looking like i&#x27;ve been cooking bacon on it. Truly a wonderful brand and i will continue to use it. If you were like me and are dealing with the same issues, PLEASE give yourself this gift and try it. It might take a few weeks for your skin to fully normalize itself but keep using it until it does and you will be very happy.</li>
    <li> My wife is like it very much in two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- it is perfectly suited to her&lt;br /&gt;- this is natural cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in germany quality</li>
    <li> This oil helps even out my combination skin. As counterintuitive as it may be, the oil actually hydrates the dry areas and seems to reduce oiliness in other areas. However, as another reviewer noted, the pump leaks slightly and over time you end up losing quite a bit of oil - not really acceptable given the cost of this product.</li>
    <li> biodynamic and beatiful small, nourishing to skin and does not leave it greasy, helps skin produce less oil.  Only need a few drops.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product in hopes of moving towards a more natural system. A year shy of 40 and a battle with adult acne, including cystic acne and oiliness, I wanted to transition to products that didn&#x27;t strip my natural oils and are more holistic.    The first day, I had some acne crop up. I thought I&#x27;d give it a few more days. I followed the directions and applied 2-3 drops only during the day.    After using this product for five days, I had break outs in new areas and cystic acne as well. This is not for me. It may work for some but not for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have really oil skin but this is just great. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> The product moisturizes your skin well. Only a few drops needed</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin that&#x27;s oily in my t-zone. I mix a few drops of this in with a day cream before applying my makeup, and my skin is hydrated all day long.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! when i stop using it i can totally notice a different in my skin. my skin flakes with any other lotions. This is the only true product ive found for my face love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Face looks and feels better. I like how it&#x27;s easy to apply in my skin. Skin feels better and less prone to dryness.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many many years and it is amazing.  Using this with other Dr. Hauschka products has kept my face in great condition even as I age.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other moisturizer after I found this.  You just need a few drops and your face will feel supple.  I have oily skin but my skin will feel tight if I don&#x27;t moisturize.  This is very lightweight!  I recommend you apply it when your face is still slightly moist.  It also seems to keep my skin clear.  The fragrance is mild and pleasant.  The bottle lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I see another reviewer broke out when using this product. I&#x27;m somewhat glad to see that I&#x27;m not the only one. I stopped using the product immediately and gave it to a co-worker who loves it. No idea why it made me break out, obviously it works for some people.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother because she was running out. She is 52 years old without a wrinkle in her skin; one of the reasons she has so few wrinkles is because she moisturizes her face well, and this is one of the products she loves to use. It&#x27;s holistic (no nasty chemical crap in it as far as I&#x27;ve read), and has a clean and pleasant, organic-like smell to it (though I have to say it looks like pizza grease in your hand).&lt;br /&gt;  I myself cannot use this product as I have extremely oily skin and &amp;#34;fighting oil with oil&amp;#34; has never been a technique that has worked for me (aka, when I ever put any oil based product on my skin, holistic or not, I get unhappy comedones). However, this products seems to do wonders for those with aging skin, whose faces may not produce as much of the replenishing oils they once did naturally in their youth.&lt;br /&gt;  The size of the bottle is not tiny, but don&#x27;t expect anything too large. That being said, a little bit of this stuff goes a long way, so feel free to use sparingly (and at that price, I definitely would). But I digress, I was delighted that my mother was delighted. I give this product two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Wrong item. Labeled as the oil- but is the day cream. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> i was skeptical to try an oil..on my oily skin but this stuff smells and feels amazing. It does not make your skin more oily. It lasts forever because you really only use a tiny amount. You dab it around your face, give it a second and then gentle rub it around.</li>
    <li> This is actually great stuff! My skin is dry/sensitive AND acne prone, so I was hesitant to add oil to my face and trigger a break out. But I tried it and holy smokes! Awesome! I use it under my regular moisturizer and I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin is! Acne is going away (yay!) and I have no more dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;You only need about 2 drops of this for all day hydration. I&#x27;m surprised at how well this product works. It actually seemed to balance my skin.</li>
    <li> use in alternate with my retinol products to keep my skin from drying out. good balancer.</li>
    <li> This oil is very nice for my face.  I have switched to now almond oil though.  I like the almond oil more &amp; can use it on my whole body.  It is much less expensive too.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for my skin. I read a lot of great reviews but it did nothing to help. I tried it for 4 months with no luck. I know everyone is different so this may work for you.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to make clear that I did not purchase this product from Amazon-- I bought it at my local organic food store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil has been a miracle for my skin.  I&#x27;ve been suffering from adult acne breakouts for about 5 years now, trying all sorts of different products (from cheap to really expensive), and found that most products helped a little bit for a little while, then my skin got out of control again.  It was either that or the products were so harsh that they irritated my skin so badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to LAST WEEK, I decided to try out Dr. Hauschka products after seeing many product reviews about them on You Tube.  What a miracle.  I use the oil day and night and it has made my skin so smooth.  Any time I have a pimple, I use it and then the pimple either disappears, or comes right to the surface ready to extract.  Also, the oil has added an extra glow to my skin that I didn&#x27;t have before.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried these products-- I can&#x27;t wait to try more of them.</li>
