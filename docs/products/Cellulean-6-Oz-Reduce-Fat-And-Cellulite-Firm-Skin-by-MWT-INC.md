      <li>There is nothing magical about this product.</li>
      <li>Nothing is more precious than one&#x27;s self-esteem (besides one&#x27;s health).  </li>
      <li>i try to order it before spring its always more in the summer months</li>
      <li>And if that is the case, you&#x27;re better off buying a cheaper, better smelling lotion.</li>
      <li>sure youll like it</li>
      <li>it sure works for me</li>
      <li>I NEVER write reviews, but I think it is important to share my experience and tell every reader that this product was hazardous to my health.    </li>
      <li>My daughter says that she heard it&#x27;s where the product is breaking up the cellulite, and that I should soon see better results.</li>
      <li>it did absolutely nothing!!!!</li>
      <li>Yes, it has a strong \\&quot;Icy-Hot-like\\&quot; smell, but I think it smells refreshing and minty.  </li>
      <li>Be free to research aminophylline side effects on the web.</li>
      <li>This product gives me the motivation I need to get working out again because if I&#x27;m getting results like this WITHOUT working out, I can just imagine how great my thighs will look after I get back into it!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fit and exercise consistently.  </li>
      <li>I like it and will definitley keep using it, the results are definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 52 year old Liscensed Esthetician (skin care) and love what this product has done for me!</li>
      <li>Thankfully, I did not pay full price for this-got it unopened from EBAY.</li>
      <li>Since I started using this product, I&#x27;ve been extremely confident in my tiny, sexy shorts.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s probable she is allergic to 1 or more of the ingredients as this is not usual.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely worth a try if you&#x27;ve already tried everything</li>
      <li>It is soooo nice to buy something that actually works as it claims.</li>
      <li>, right?  </li>
      <li>If so, they wipe right off.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at how quick I saw results!</li>
      <li>First of all, it does not work.</li>
      <li>I used the Cellulean gel for 1 week and, at first, saw my skin was smoother and firmer...</li>
      <li>but it really does work!</li>
      <li>Second and most important, this product made me have irregular heartbeats and heart palpitations on 3 different occasions.    </li>
      <li>I ignored the previous views from concerned consumers and decided to try this product on my own.  </li>
      <li>the areas where i applied it is very noticeably smoother.</li>
      <li>I bought on a free trial  - only paying for shipping but</li>
      <li>how much did you use per application?</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;LipoSculpt (which has no smell really)</li>
      <li>I am young, healthy, don&#x27;t take any prescriptions, and never had any health issues- especially not regarding my heart.    </li>
      <li>Several weeks after you stop using it, your legs will return to the original state.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>After it dries, just check your hindquarters in the mirror to make sure there aren&#x27;t little bits of gel remaining stuck to you.  </li>
      <li>Nivea and St. Ives work exactly the same for $12 instead of $75..</li>
      <li>If you like dealing with shady companies and using junkie products, you will love cellulean.  </li>
      <li>One funny thing about it is that they added menthol for no apparent reason so it makes your skin feel minty and tingly when you put it on...</li>
      <li>The gel causes a pretty intense burning/tingling sensation like Icy-Hot but that doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many so called anti-cellulite lotions and they all smell bad, cost too much, and come in tiny amounts.</li>

<li> I have tried many so called anti-cellulite lotions and they all smell bad, cost too much, and come in tiny amounts.</li>
<li> I think the far less expensive Loreal Sublime Slim is much better overall.  </li>
<li> It is not perfect and it probably won&#x27;t make all the cellulite dissappear, but it does reduce it visually SIGNIFICANTLY!</li>
<li> After a month, I saw little to no results, plus gained 7 lbs exactly, just like the other reviewer who gave this 1 star.  </li>
<li> Within 2 days the little gross fat bubbles i had in my inner thighs was gone completely.</li>
<li> When I realised I complained and asked for a refund and they ignored my first three e-mail until I said I work with the media</li>
<li> (you only need a very small amount as it really spreads)</li>
<li> I drink water all day long, worked out in fitness classes 4 days a week, had ample cardio, and was on a balanced diet.  </li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t take long to arrive.  </li>
<li> a long</li>
<li> I am very disappionted and it was a waste of my money!!</li>
<li> I used almost 2 bottles, following instructions, and saw no results- TOTAL waste of money.    </li>
<li> The product does not live up to its commercials.  </li>
<li> He told me that aminophylline is a substance used for bronchial asthma, and side effects included irregular heartbeat, seizures, nausea and vomiting, among other.        </li>
<li> i use it on thighs,arms and back of legs,and stomach also.a little bit goes</li>
<li> I have not had results from other products</li>
<li> I have tried several cellulite-redcucing products, and have to say, I do not love this one.  </li>
<li> (I&#x27;ll return the empty bottle to the company so I won&#x27;t get charged for membership and just buy it for less elsewhere online.)  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d been big for years, but my legs had always been hard.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t find myself having to tug my shorts down as hard as I can to try to conceal my lumps, bumps, dimples, and ripples because there aren&#x27;t any left!  </li>
<li> We only live so long, so why spend it feeling ugly</li>
<li> I used it on my thighs, and went down 2  pant sizes, lost 2 inches on each leg.</li>
<li> Unless of course you use it along with a workout routine and a change in diet (less dairy and fatty foods).</li>
<li> It does not work, I have also tried mixing it with Nivea Cellulite Cream to give it a little boost.  </li>
<li> I shouldn&#x27;t have been so stupid to think anything was free.</li>
<li> ive been useing this product for a few years now and dont want to go with out</li>
<li> I also used it in conjuction with excercising (the Firm workout) at home.</li>
<li> And as of today the dimples on my butt and thighs has been reduced at least by half.</li>
<li> somewhere in the small print it stated that they will resend it every month and charge me 80euros.</li>
<li> I catch him looking down and drooling behind me all the time.  </li>
<li> The only thing I find annoying is the residue that&#x27;s left behind that doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb.  </li>
<li> but i seriously doubt it has anything to do with how it is working.</li>
<li> It is not a good product.</li>
<li> and they were very rude.</li>
<li> and then they were very rude and refused the refund.</li>
<li> The only product that works well for the thighs (but is sticky, stains, &amp; smells bad) is Dermalin APG by Klein &amp; Becker, which seems to have been sold to Nutrasport and relabeled as Cutting Gel.</li>
<li> How utterly silly and ridiculous!</li>
<li> and i was skeptical about this one</li>
<li> Not only did Cellulean NOT have the desired affect, but the company has terrible customer service.  </li>
<li> ill get it anyway</li>
<li> I would rather give up this expensive lotion that probably dosen&#x27;t work anyway than give up running which has been proven to work for weight loss and cellulite.</li>
<li> This stuff does not work and the company was impossible to deal with.</li>
<li> My weight has been stable for years, so this is very disappointing.</li>
<li> VERY disappointed.  </li>
<li> Well after I ran, after putting this product on 12 hours before I ran, I had the worst runners rash between my legs from my legs sticking together as I was running.  </li>
<li> I can FEEL women&#x27;s nasty, jealous scowls everywhere</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product leaves a sticky feeling.  I didn&#x27;t see any results.  I drink water all day long, worked out in fitness classes 4 days a week, had ample cardio, and was on a balanced diet.  I don&#x27;t eat red meat or pork, and didn&#x27;t everything to improve my circulation.  This product did not to aide my cellulite lose!  Don&#x27;t waist your time or money!</li>
    <li> After using Cellulean for about 5 weeks my legs were mushy and jiggled when I walked. I&#x27;d been big for years, but my legs had always been hard. My daughter says that she heard it&#x27;s where the product is breaking up the cellulite, and that I should soon see better results. Still waiting,</li>
    <li> I used this product for  3 months. I stop drinking soda I started to eat healthy to get my cellulite gone and I have not yet seen any results.  I cancel it because is a rip off don&#x27;t buy...</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews, but I think it is important to share my experience and tell every reader that this product was hazardous to my health.    First of all, it does not work. I used almost 2 bottles, following instructions, and saw no results- TOTAL waste of money.    Second and most important, this product made me have irregular heartbeats and heart palpitations on 3 different occasions.    I am young, healthy, don&#x27;t take any prescriptions, and never had any health issues- especially not regarding my heart.    I did not know what was causing my irregular heartbeat until I went to the doctor. I told him about my condition and how scared I was. He asked me several questions including a list of all prescriptions, vitamins, supplements I had been using. I commented I was using Cellulean Gel- that contained aminophylline.    He told me that aminophylline is a substance used for bronchial asthma, and side effects included irregular heartbeat, seizures, nausea and vomiting, among other.        Be free to research aminophylline side effects on the web.</li>
    <li> Not only did Cellulean NOT have the desired affect, but the company has terrible customer service.  They refused to stand by their 100% satisfaction guarantee.  Stay away from Cellulean!!</li>
    <li> This is the best cellulite treatment without having to spend alot of time &amp; money. I was surprised at how quick I saw results! I used it on my thighs, and went down 2  pant sizes, lost 2 inches on each leg. Great product with fast results</li>
    <li> ive been useing this product for a few years now and dont want to go with out it.i told my friend about it and she still orders it also.if you use it on your problem celulite areas every day faithfully,it will lessen look of cellulite and tighten skin also. i use it on thighs,arms and back of legs,and stomach also.a little bit goes a long way.also i try to order it before spring its always more in the summer months also.but ill get it anyway if im almost out lol.&lt;br /&gt;im sure youll like it it sure works for me</li>
    <li> I have tried many so called anti-cellulite lotions and they all smell bad, cost too much, and come in tiny amounts. I decided to try one more product before giving up and Cellulean is working!!!!!!!! I got it just last week, it does not smell and its a gel like liquid so it lasts. Within 2 days the little gross fat bubbles i had in my inner thighs was gone completely. And as of today the dimples on my butt and thighs has been reduced at least by half. And I had some nasty cellulite. I do diet and exersise but never got results just doing those things. I instantly felt my skin firmer after applying Cellulean. It is soooo nice to buy something that actually works as it claims. Good luck to everyone!!! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I was buying more of this great product and decided to read some of the reviews. For those who said it didn&#x27;t work, I have to wonder a. what you were expecting?(it&#x27; not a miracle gel) b. how much did you use per application? (you only need a very small amount as it really spreads) c. do you know a topical product CANNOT make you gain weight? How utterly silly and ridiculous! I felt the need to submit this review because I can tell you this product does work. However, the results are temporary. Several weeks after you stop using it, your legs will return to the original state. Unless of course you use it along with a workout routine and a change in diet (less dairy and fatty foods). Then your legs will retain some of the change. I use it after a workout when I get out of the shower. I have shown all my friends the results and they are buying it as we speak. Listen, you need to educate yourself on this product, how to properly use it, it&#x27;s ingredients and possible results as well as the nature of cellulite. For the person who said it gave her heart palps it&#x27;s probable she is allergic to 1 or more of the ingredients as this is not usual. I&#x27;m a 52 year old Liscensed Esthetician (skin care) and love what this product has done for me! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> There is nothing magical about this product. I used this every day for a month and have seen no improvement. If they said this helped reduce cellulite, it&#x27;s probably from all the massaging you had to do. And if that is the case, you&#x27;re better off buying a cheaper, better smelling lotion. I personally like St.Ives Cellulite Shield. It smells great and it can be used as an all around lotion. The Cellulean is a sticky gel and smells like a dentist office.</li>
    <li> I bought on a free trial  - only paying for shipping but somewhere in the small print it stated that they will resend it every month and charge me 80euros. When I realised I complained and asked for a refund and they ignored my first three e-mail until I said I work with the media and then they were very rude and refused the refund. I shouldn&#x27;t have been so stupid to think anything was free. AVOID this product, it doesn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s a con.</li>
    <li> I have tried several cellulite-redcucing products, and have to say, I do not love this one.  It has a menthol smell, like a sports cream, and it leaves a grimy/pastey residue on your skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month with no noticable change in the appearance of my thighs.  I think the far less expensive Loreal Sublime Slim is much better overall.  Thankfully, I did not pay full price for this-got it unopened from EBAY.</li>
    <li> If you like dealing with shady companies and using junkie products, you will love cellulean.  Bottom Line:  This stuff does not work and the company was impossible to deal with.</li>
    <li> I used the Cellulean gel for 1 week and, at first, saw my skin was smoother and firmer... Then, I found it made me gain 7 lbs! I have not gained any weight in over a year (my weight is stable) and after using this product GAINED 7 lbs in ONE WEEK! A week after I stopped using it the weight is still there so it is not just water weight... I also noticed I now have a lot more cellulite than before! This is scary--the product not only did not work but had the opposite effect it was supposed to. VERY disappointed.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LipoSculpt (which has no smell really) worked well for the abs but not for the thighs. The only product that works well for the thighs (but is sticky, stains, &amp; smells bad) is Dermalin APG by Klein &amp; Becker, which seems to have been sold to Nutrasport and relabeled as Cutting Gel. I will be going back to using Dermalin despite the smell &amp; consistancy because it works.</li>
    <li> The recommended time to use the product before results are seen is 30 days, and i have seen results after only 2 weeks. i have not lost or gained any weight or inches but the areas where i applied it is very noticeably smoother. I have not had results from other products and i was skeptical about this one but it really does work! It is not perfect and it probably won&#x27;t make all the cellulite dissappear, but it does reduce it visually SIGNIFICANTLY! One funny thing about it is that they added menthol for no apparent reason so it makes your skin feel minty and tingly when you put it on...but i seriously doubt it has anything to do with how it is working. I like it and will definitley keep using it, the results are definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Works good.  I had a lot of cellulite on the back of my thighs, especially after having my son.  After about 3 weeks of using it, my cellullite is gone.  I also used it in conjuction with excercising (the Firm workout) at home.</li>
    <li> it did absolutely nothing!!!! I am very disappionted and it was a waste of my money!! I would request my money back if i could!!</li>
    <li> I only used this product for maybe 2 days and already noticed results!  I haven&#x27;t been sticking to exercise or dieting, so I know it was only this gel that was doing the trick.  Yes, it has a strong \\&quot;Icy-Hot-like\\&quot; smell, but I think it smells refreshing and minty.  The only thing I find annoying is the residue that&#x27;s left behind that doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb.  After it dries, just check your hindquarters in the mirror to make sure there aren&#x27;t little bits of gel remaining stuck to you.  If so, they wipe right off.  The gel causes a pretty intense burning/tingling sensation like Icy-Hot but that doesn&#x27;t last long.  Since I started using this product, I&#x27;ve been extremely confident in my tiny, sexy shorts.  I don&#x27;t find myself having to tug my shorts down as hard as I can to try to conceal my lumps, bumps, dimples, and ripples because there aren&#x27;t any left!  I can FEEL women&#x27;s nasty, jealous scowls everywhere I go and I SEE them when I get up and walk away and look back at their eyes on my rear.  It&#x27;s awesome!  I&#x27;m 36 and I haven&#x27;t had thighs like this since I was a teenager!  My boyfriend is amazed and very pleased with the results as well.  I catch him looking down and drooling behind me all the time.  Nothing is more precious than one&#x27;s self-esteem (besides one&#x27;s health).  We only live so long, so why spend it feeling ugly, right?  This product gives me the motivation I need to get working out again because if I&#x27;m getting results like this WITHOUT working out, I can just imagine how great my thighs will look after I get back into it!  (I&#x27;ll return the empty bottle to the company so I won&#x27;t get charged for membership and just buy it for less elsewhere online.)  This is absolutely worth a try if you&#x27;ve already tried everything and it didn&#x27;t take long to arrive.  I love feeling confident and sexy in my shorts again!!!  Not even my $400 cellulite treatment therapy at the spa delivered results like this!</li>
    <li> This product is such a gimmick.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything.  It tingles when you put it on and that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;m going to return this.  Nivea and St. Ives work exactly the same for $12 instead of $75..</li>
    <li> What a joke.  The product does not live up to its commercials.  I had no improvement.  Sent product back to company, they would not refund my credit card and they were very rude. 30 days later they sent me another shipment, knowing that I  had already cancelled.  I sent shipment back to them and they will not give me a refund.  So, I have a charge on my credit card and no product.  I will never buy again and have told everyone that I know to stay away from this company and it&#x27;s product. ***BUYER BEWARE***</li>
    <li> This product did not produce andy results for me</li>
    <li> It works along with healthy diet and exercise!</li>
    <li> I am still using results are visible...love it</li>
    <li> After a month, I saw little to no results, plus gained 7 lbs exactly, just like the other reviewer who gave this 1 star.  I&#x27;m very fit and exercise consistently.  My weight has been stable for years, so this is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I went to bed.  The next morning I got up an ran about 3 mi.  I do not have a model body which is why I was shopping for cellulite creams.  When I run my legs rub together.  This is not a lotion it is a gel like substance and no amout of rubbing this product in will make it non sticky.  Well after I ran, after putting this product on 12 hours before I ran, I had the worst runners rash between my legs from my legs sticking together as I was running.  I would rather give up this expensive lotion that probably dosen&#x27;t work anyway than give up running which has been proven to work for weight loss and cellulite.</li>
    <li> It causes a coating on your skin that peals off, I don&#x27;t see where it is helping.  I used it daily.  I would not buy it again.[[ASIN:B000GAOAKA Cellulean (6 oz.) Anti-Cellulite Treatment]]</li>
    <li> This item does not work.  I ignored the previous views from concerned consumers and decided to try this product on my own.  It does not work, I have also tried mixing it with Nivea Cellulite Cream to give it a little boost.  It is not a good product.</li>
