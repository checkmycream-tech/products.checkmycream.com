      <li>a very healthy way&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for balance, some core, mostly legs, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I have plenty of my own cushion</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very easy to move from room to room</li>
      <li>/&gt;(2)  Very easy to assemble.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Mostly considering the amount of time &amp;#34;I want to be on it&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I just received it, and I worked out for one hour on it, yesterday, because I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I love it..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it more time to see the results though.</li>
      <li>Okay - this is Day One</li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve read all the reviews, all the comments &amp; I waited about six months before I hit the send button this purchase.</li>
      <li>Nice machine that is actually fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Easy to assemble; lightweight and easy to move around; not noisy; doesn&#x27;t use electricity - and after 10 minutes of &amp;#34;ride-em-cowboy&amp;#34; one can feel core.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to figure out.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and can be moved from room to room with no problem.  </li>
      <li>Well made, easy to assemble.</li>
      <li>I plan to use hand weights for a more completely workout, but this is really good for what I want.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>Just be sure your shoes give adequate protection.</li>
      <li>If you pedal backward, this is the motion that provides a great upper thigh workout.  </li>
      <li>Much more fun than a treadmill for me.</li>
      <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too happy about was the seat.</li>
      <li>I am 65 years old &amp; in good health.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to put together and ridin&#x27; right away!</li>
      <li>Definitely the RC was a very effective cardio for me.</li>
      <li>(Full disclosure: I am 65 years old &amp; in good health.)  </li>
      <li>But if you plan to watch an entire movie on it :o) like myself.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>is FUN!</li>
      <li>This is a lot of fun and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Very efficient to keep moving while watching ur favorite show or even a movie.</li>
      <li>One CON is that I can not stretch out my legs full length..</li>
      <li>Luckily, I use headphones to watch stuff on my PC or it would be too noisy for me.  </li>
      <li>A quick exercise that can be done while watching tv.</li>
      <li>Best I could describe it would be like a hand mixer on very slow speed:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun.  </li>
      <li>Go slow to warm up a bit before really getting going; makes a good cool-off process, too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most I&#x27;ve done so far is 30 minutes at a time.  </li>
      <li>Too fun..</li>
      <li>That is absolutely right.  </li>
      <li>That is absolutely right.  </li>
      <li>Your butt will start hurting after the first 30minutes.</li>
      <li>This fitness trainer does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>as someone said, it&#x27;s not necessary to put a lot of pressure, it&#x27;s more about body movement to get it going.</li>
      <li>You can feel it after the first use.  </li>
      <li>Will report more later....</li>
      <li>Despite the lack of an intense core workout, the machine is still fun to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall a pretty good way to get that extra low-impact activity while watching shows or movies.</li>
      <li>I rode the trainer at a fairly good pace for 20 minutes and, while my legs were killing me, I felt very little in my abs.&lt;br /&gt;(2)  </li>
      <li>The vendor says that if the sound it makes is not one that implies &#x27;rubbing&#x27; or &#x27;scraping&#x27; or some other malfunction, and it works, then he would assume it is just the operation that produces the sound.</li>
      <li>Once that&#x27;s screwed in, you&#x27;re pretty much ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;(3)  </li>
      <li>Based on the positive reviews, I thought this machine would really blast my midsection.  </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t do much for my abs at all.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to get a proper seat &amp;#34;footing&amp;#34;, or you&#x27;ll end up blistering your bum.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable enough to ride it for periods of 20 to 30minutes.</li>
      <li>Also, it does not take up much room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would&#x27;ve been nice if the machine was designed to distribute the pedaling motion across your entire foot, but as currently designed you&#x27;re stepping on a straight metal bar.  </li>
      <li>Very well made.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use it much as yet but will</li>
      <li>Very compact.</li>
      <li>Very compact and does not take up much space at all.  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m going to really like it.  </li>
      <li>I really got the rhythm and started to feel it in my abds.  </li>
      <li>It would&#x27;ve been nice if the machine was designed to distribute the pedaling motion across your entire foot, but as currently designed you&#x27;re stepping on a straight metal bar.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really give you any sort of workout at all.</li>
      <li>It took a few minutes to get the hang and get it rolling, but once I got it, it was fun and energetic.  </li>
      <li>The seat is pretty hard, so I would recommend the padded biking shorts, which kind of goes against the &amp;#34;ten minute workout&amp;#34; theory.  </li>
      <li>simple set-up&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight &amp; easy to move; I have mine stored in between a couple of file cabinets on a piece of old carpet that I can slide out when I want to position it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>far as the handle: I don&#x27;t really use it that much.</li>
      <li>--older women may appreciate this!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Main reason why I bought it</li>
      <li>The seat is kind of hard.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like was that even though tests show I have good bone density, and I wore footwear with a cushioning although flexible sole,  I fractured a bone from repetitively pressing on the footrest.</li>
      <li>The manufacturer said it was normal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve felt the most change in my legs; going up and down stairs seems a bit easier.&lt;br /&gt;(Full</li>

      <li>Soooo, guess I&#x27;ll live with it.</li>
      <li>It was fun, and what I really liked was that a mere 10 minutes was equivalent to an hour walk.</li>
      <li>Not a problem at first, but if you&#x27;re planning on working out for any length of time it does begin to hurt, especially with the type of motion the machine is simulating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>was looking for something similar to the iRide, but more active.  </li>
      <li>I used it for about an hour a day for a week before I lost interest completely.</li>

    <li> Wow love this little thing...Easy to put together and ridin&#x27; right away! EEEHA..Too fun..you can make it go forward or backwards...I can see how people might not think it works enough for the rest of the body...well swing one arm in big circles while riding it..like out of the gate rodeo style. then switch to other arm..OR hold Campbell&#x27;s  soup can&#x27;s in your hands and do arm circles.. tight or large...come on this is FUN! Use your imagination... I HATE exercise...and this ain&#x27;t a giant eraser to get rid of fat..it all takes work! Trying not to over do it so I can at least walk tomorrow..Will report more later.... see if I lose interest! LOL I&#x27;m happy!  One CON is that I can not stretch out my legs full length..I wish I could..I am 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and have long legs.I will try with some extra padding on the seat or maybe take it to a fabricator to extend the height..if in the long run I find this an issue. Otherwise I love it..that is why the 4 instead of 5 stars. Built very solid...that is why I know I could take it to a fabricator as the steel is heavy duty. I have tried to change other things that aren&#x27;t heavy duty steel and it they are hard to adapt.</li>
    <li> Great ab exercise but it made my shin hurt after 15 min. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m not used to the stretch on the front of my legs. Hope to start using it again only not as long until I get my legs used to it.  Reminded me of riding a rocking horse as a kid. Much more fun than a treadmill for me.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for those like me who need to strengthen the core muscles. A quick exercise that can be done while watching tv.</li>
    <li> Very efficient to keep moving while watching ur favorite show or even a movie. When you least notice 2hrs went by and ur still moving. Very compact. Fits in every corner.&lt;br /&gt;* The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too happy about was the seat. Mostly considering the amount of time &amp;#34;I want to be on it&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s comfortable enough to ride it for periods of 20 to 30minutes. But if you plan to watch an entire movie on it :o) like myself. Your butt will start hurting after the first 30minutes. And not precisely cuz of the workout (my legs and everything else hurt &amp;#34;on a very healthy way&amp;#34;. You can feel ur muscles working. And don&#x27;t get me wrong I have plenty of my own cushion lol. But the pain in the butt has to do with the seat design I guess. I fixed it wrapping a small pillow around the seat. Problem solved. Overall a pretty good way to get that extra low-impact activity while watching shows or movies. Main reason why I bought it (I go to the gym 4-5 times a week, got a stationary bike at home as well as a treadmill but still... I hate the feeling in my body after watching something on tv for too long without moving a finger. So I needed something for that).</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic &amp; fun alternative to crunches (dear Lord,I hate those)!  I use it at least 20 minutes a day and my abs are tight!  Just be careful when you first start using it. It&#x27;s important to get a proper seat &amp;#34;footing&amp;#34;, or you&#x27;ll end up blistering your bum.</li>
    <li> I have had a lower back problem for years and need to strengthen my abdominals to support my back.  You can feel it after the first use.  And it doesn&#x27;t bother my back as I had feared.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> This fitness trainer does exactly what it says it will do.  I am on a weight loss plan and I see dramatic results using this trainer for exercise.  My mid section is firmer and disappearing!</li>
    <li> Based on the positive reviews, I thought this machine would really blast my midsection.  However, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t do much for my abs at all.  As another reviewer mentioned, it does provide an excellent workout for your thighs.  You can begin to feel the burn in your upper thighs after only a couple of minutes of use, but as for the abs, not much at all.  The machine attempts to simulate the movement of a mechanical bull.  It doesn&#x27;t buck violently like a mechanical bull; in fact it&#x27;s a very smooth ride, but you do get the &amp;#34;up &amp; down&amp;#34; sensation of a bucking bronco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can &amp;#34;pedal&amp;#34; either forward or backward and depending upon which way you go, I&#x27;ve found the workout changes a bit.  If you pedal backward, this is the motion that provides a great upper thigh workout.  While going forward, the thigh workout is much less intense, but you do feel it a little more in your abs - but only slightly.&lt;br /&gt;A few pros &amp; cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;(1)  Very well made.  The machine itself seems very solid and I don&#x27;t expect it to fall apart anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;(2)  Very easy to assemble.  In fact there is not much to assemble at all.  There are only a couple of bolts which attach the stabilizer bar at the base of the machine.  Once that&#x27;s screwed in, you&#x27;re pretty much ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;(3)  It&#x27;s fun.  Despite the lack of an intense core workout, the machine is still fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;(4)  Very compact and does not take up much space at all.  Plus, it&#x27;s very easy to move from room to room if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;(1)  Not the core/abdominal workout I was expecting (or was advertised).  I rode the trainer at a fairly good pace for 20 minutes and, while my legs were killing me, I felt very little in my abs.&lt;br /&gt;(2)  The seat is kind of hard.  Not a problem at first, but if you&#x27;re planning on working out for any length of time it does begin to hurt, especially with the type of motion the machine is simulating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note:  another reviewer recommended wearing thick soled shoes while using the trainer.  That is absolutely right.  It would&#x27;ve been nice if the machine was designed to distribute the pedaling motion across your entire foot, but as currently designed you&#x27;re stepping on a straight metal bar.  Not a problem if wearing the proper shoes, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it otherwise.another reviewer recommended wearing thick soled shoes while using the trainer.  That is absolutely right.

    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve read all the reviews, all the comments &amp; I waited about six months before I hit the send button this purchase. Here are my observations after one week:&lt;br /&gt;Very simple set-up&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight &amp; easy to move; I have mine stored in between a couple of file cabinets on a piece of old carpet that I can slide out when I want to position it.&lt;br /&gt;Noise level: weird. My son says he can hear it in the kitchen downstairs coming from the ceiling. My hubby can hear it from his office in the next room.  The vendor says that if the sound it makes is not one that implies &#x27;rubbing&#x27; or &#x27;scraping&#x27; or some other malfunction, and it works, then he would assume it is just the operation that produces the sound. Best I could describe it would be like a hand mixer on very slow speed: rrrrrr-rrrrr-rrrrr-rrrrr-  Luckily, I use headphones to watch stuff on my PC or it would be too noisy for me.  My hearing aids pick up the higher frequencies which just makes it worse, hence the headphones.&lt;br /&gt;Operation: easy-peasy.  Took about a minute to figure out.  I alternate between forwards and backwards, include arm stretches, adjust the area where it&#x27;s pressing on the seat by just shifting a bit.  Most I&#x27;ve done so far is 30 minutes at a time.  Go slow to warm up a bit before really getting going; makes a good cool-off process, too.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the handle: I don&#x27;t really use it that much. As I said, I alternate in order not to get bored or tight, which means I&#x27;m not in any one position for long enough for it to matter.  Hold on to the back of the seat for a bit, do some bicep curls, &amp; so forth. It&#x27;s almost like letting yourself do dance moves with your arms, if you get bored in the same position.&lt;br /&gt;Foot bars: I do barefoot running, so the bars are not a problem for me at all, in fact I like a little pressure on the soles of my feet, but as someone said, it&#x27;s not necessary to put a lot of pressure, it&#x27;s more about body movement to get it going. If you wear something like vibrams, that&#x27;s perfect, I think.

    <li> Updated as I&#x27;ve had it awhile.  Still great, easy, in perfect working order.  Still chafing the hiney, lol.  But I do what I have to do.  Nice machine that is actually fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;I just got this yesterday.  I think I&#x27;m going to really like it.  I may update my rating to a 5 if it lasts well.  That&#x27;s the only reason for the 4, I just don&#x27;t have enough history yet to warrant a 5.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something similar to the iRide, but more active.  This fills that as you get a feel of a loping or galloping horse (NOT a mechanical bull).  It&#x27;s good for balance, some core, mostly legs, which is what I was looking for.  This is leg powered instead of electric.  It took a few minutes to get the hang and get it rolling, but once I got it, it was fun and energetic.  The energy you put in is what you get out.  Go for a leisurely lope or a flat out gallop - your legs propel you at the speed you want.  I plan to use hand weights for a more completely workout, but this is really good for what I want.&lt;br /&gt;Only warning from my side - watch for hiney chafing!  Not used to squishing that far back in a saddle.  I put a sheepskin saddle seat cover on mine and it helped a lot.</li>
    <li> Well made, easy to assemble. Does not work out abdominal and low back cores as described! Good for thigh cores!</li>
    <li> I use it about 3 or 4 days a week.  It is a great workout without spending a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Definitely the RC was a very effective cardio for me. It was fun, and what I really liked was that a mere 10 minutes was equivalent to an hour walk. Also, it does not take up much room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was that even though tests show I have good bone density, and I wore footwear with a cushioning although flexible sole,  I fractured a bone from repetitively pressing on the footrest. It was explained by my doctor that the footrest should accommodate the entire foot resting on it, as a stepper foot, and allow a heel-toe motion as in walking. The Rodeo Core only has a bar. BEWARE! Just be sure your shoes give adequate protection. I am very sad that I can no longer use this product and had to return it.</li>
    <li> The directions were alittle confusing at first.  After I played on it, I am now looking for my cowboy hat.  My inner thighs are sore from just 10 min on it.  It&#x27;s easy, small enough to be placed anywhere ( which is one reason why I purchesed it).  My last work out I really got the rhythm and started to feel it in my abds.  YEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAA! I recomend it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use it much as yet but will</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really give you any sort of workout at all. I used it for about an hour a day for a week before I lost interest completely.</li>
    <li> Hubby wanted.  I got it for him.</li>
    <li> The seat is pretty hard, so I would recommend the padded biking shorts, which kind of goes against the &amp;#34;ten minute workout&amp;#34; theory.  You WILL end up rubbing some sensitive areas very raw if not careful.</li>
    <li> Great exercise for the legs and core muscles.  Small and convenient to place.  Best of all - it makes no noise!!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Good machine, but it is a bit too noisy for watching tv while excercising.  The manufacturer said it was normal.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble; lightweight and easy to move around; not noisy; doesn&#x27;t use electricity - and after 10 minutes of &amp;#34;ride-em-cowboy&amp;#34; one can feel core.  Okay - this is Day One and I only got off because I have other things that needed to be done. I&#x27;ll probably post again after using this daily - probably twice daily - to advise whether I&#x27;m still the old self or a tighter, fitter new one.&lt;br /&gt;(But can&#x27;t resist saying it&#x27;s like being a kid again, riding the horse and dreaming dreams . . . .)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m getting a workout from it.  I feel tired after doing it for about 45 minutes but am not sure how much of a workout I&#x27;m getting in my core or thighs.  I&#x27;ll give it more time to see the results though.</li>
    <li> Excellent core excerciser workout!</li>
    <li> This is a lot of fun and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is as advertised. You can watch tv while using it. It is like riding a horse. It strengthens your back and core. It&#x27;s easy to figure out. You can get your pulse rate way up there if you like (which I do). A great exercise machine! Worth the price!</li>
    <li> This exercise equipment is the best thing that I have EVER come across!!!!! I just received it, and I worked out for one hour on it, yesterday, because I fell in love with it. This is, definitely, for someone who does not like to work out.  It is easy to use, and can be moved from room to room with no problem.  I will be using this machine with arm weights, and I will not need to use any other workout machines.  I can not tell you how wonderful this exercise equipment is!!!</li>
