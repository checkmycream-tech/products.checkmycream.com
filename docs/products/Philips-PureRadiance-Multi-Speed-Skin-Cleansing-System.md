      <li>The heads are easy to pop on and off, and each comes with its own cap, and the cap also has air vents.  </li>

      <li>I have been using the skin cleansing system for more than a week now.  </li>
      <li>love the Philips PureRadiance Skin Cleansing System.</li>
      <li>It’s very easy to clean and travels well.</li>
      <li>It is very powerful and i love to just glide it across my face and see the brush go to work, i am also a clarisonic user, but am for the moment hooked on this because it seems to be more efficient.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try using the normal brush a bit more, but with my skin this may be too much of a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also find the Clarisonic to be more comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far I am happy with it.  </li>
      <li>This is easy to use and really makes my skin feel good.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use and came with two brushes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and it looks nicer set out on the counter in the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and maneuver over the face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and it looks nicer set out on the counter in the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so anything that makes this type of treatment easy is a blessing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush head is easy to change.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wand style and is easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>This has done a wonderful job of making them less bothersome and</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, takes only a minute and provides great results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to handle and works great to cleanse and exfoliate facial skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was also great that I could use this while in the shower and didn&#x27;t have to worry about it getting wet since they have made it water safe.</li>
      <li>Also travel-friendly because of light weight.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>I received this product for free as a part of the Amazon vine program.  </li>

      <li>It is also easy to clean -</li>
      <li>and I like the smooth feel that the brushes give me.</li>
      <li>PureRadiance cleansing system is gentle, and using its brushes feels much more comfortable, and is far more effective than scrubbing away with a terry washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Worth to buy!</li>
      <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t say this is better than the Clarisonic since they are both different products with different features, but it works great for me!</li>
      <li>this Philips system comes with something unique as well, a new kind of scrubbing technology.</li>
      <li>Therefore, you could easily share one main unit among more than one person.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is safe for use in the bath or shower, so that is pretty cool.</li>
      <li>The device is basically a brush that rotates and pulses to clean the skin.</li>
      <li>It uses a pulsing ultrasonic type of movement to clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve aged my skin has become more sensitive and has experienced more break outs as it goes through aging.</li>
      <li>The PureRadiance did give my face a nice clean feel and felt soft when using.  </li>
      <li>So far I am loving this skin cleansing tool.</li>
      <li>Using that foam pad attachment with the DDF micro-derma crystals scrub is the most intense exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t worry much about touching any of the battery terminal contacts.  </li>
      <li>and I have been blessed with good skin, but am now 46 and age is starting to show.</li>
      <li>I like how this brush is more gentle on the nose area and that it spins in circles in addition to the sonic waves.</li>
      <li>she realizes is the same principle with the Sonicare toothbrush ... which leads to a superior &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I am really appreciating my bathroom more as a spa with the cleaning system for facials, foot spa amd jacuzzi tub.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure:  </li>
      <li>It is good for daily use or to use just when you need it.</li>
      <li>I wet the brush with warm water, squirt one pumpful of my favorite liquid cleanser on the brush, turn it on, and move the handheld wand over my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a worthy investment.</li>
      <li>Excellent convenient long lasting device to really clean the skin and the pores.</li>
      <li>BrightTherapy Professional Sonic Skin Care System Waterproof]]) that would only pulse with no rotation, to see if it is more gentle and effective, but found I like Philips device better</li>
      <li>My wife says it does a great job at cleaning her skin and removing her makeup while still being gentle on her skin due to the unique sonic technology.</li>
      <li>and I really like how smooth it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>It does, however, amazing things for my skin overall.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Full disclosure:  I received this product for free as a part of the Amazon vine program.  My review is honest and trustworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a teenage son that is dealing with a medium/acute acne issue and is seeing a dermatologist regularly.  The dermatologist recently recommended we purchase a product similar to this for almost double the price.  As luck would have it we were offered one for free for review.  Currently he is using this with the medicated face was he was provided by the doctor.  The included brush may be a bit much and thus we will be purchasing the Philips PureRadiance Sensitive Skin Brush head.  The system works well when used regularly and has improved the quality of skin for my son and is reducing his visible acne as a result....medication is naturally helping but cleansing properly is making it much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any complaint, it would definitely be price...there are a lot of these things out there in different brands that cost half as much.  While the Philips was half the cost of what the dermatologist was trying to sell us, it is still on the expensive side.</li>
    <li> Good conditions ~~ excellent :)</li>
    <li> This is a great cleansing system. We have been using it for 3 weeks now and really like it so far. It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to handle and works great to cleanse and exfoliate facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system cleanses well. We actually feel the skin becomes noticeably softer and smoother after only a week of use. We just place a tad of facial soap on the brush head and put it to work. After it&#x27;s done, just put the brush head under running water to rinse and then put the plastic cap on it or place it in the charging cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush size is nice. It&#x27;s about 1.5&amp;#34; in diameter, just about the right size for us. The bristles are soft and comfortable to push against the face for an even coverage. The rotating torque is pretty strong and there is also a slight vibration on the brush head during use. It runs for 60 seconds per session. Every 20 seconds there is a 0.5 second pause that signals you to move to a different zone on the face (left face, right face and the forehead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing wand is stylish and ergonomically designed. It&#x27;s easy to hold and maneuver over the face. It has a light blue body with a thick, transparent outer shell that gives it a luxurious look. There is only one silver power button on it The system comes with two interchangeable brush heads - a regular one for daily use and an exfoliation one for weekly use. The brush head is easy to change. Just gently pull it off and push a new one on the hexagonal driver shaft until it clicks in. Both brush heads feel nice and soft and we hardly notice a difference between them in the way they feel on our face. The exfoliation head does have a gray strip of bristles across the middle that could be a little more abrasive but we can&#x27;t really tell from our actual use. The wand uses a built-in Li-ion battery that is not user serviceable. When the battery eventually dies, you&#x27;ll have to buy a new cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging cradle is pretty small, about the diameter of the wand head. There are two metal contacts in the cradle that are keyed to the electric contacts on the wand, so you can&#x27;t put the wand in the wrong way. The plastic cradle is light and has a small footprint, so the wand can get knocked over rather easily. There is also a big hole at the bottom of the cradle to drain away any dripping liquid from the brush head. One problem I have with the cradle is the long power plug that is sticking out at the back. It looks like a miniature version of the &amp;#34;8&amp;#34;-shaped appliance plug. The plug has a strain relief that sticks nearly 2&amp;#34; out, so it&#x27;s difficult to place the cradle all the way against the back wall on the countertop. It&#x27;s going to take up some extra space behind the cradle. The AC adapter is white and relatively small. It is rated at 7.5W with an output of 18V at 400mA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we really like the Philips PureRadiance Skin Cleansing System. It works great for us and makes the skin noticeable softer and smoother. There are probably better cleansing systems in the market that are more heavy-duty for twice the price (Clarisonic comes to mind). We think the Philips PureRadiance is a great system that does a pretty good job for under $100.</li>
    <li> I hate the feeling that there is makeup or product left on my skin, and thought this brush did a great job of removing it. I love that it can remove it without using harsh chemicals on your skin because I try to avoid using too many skin products. My skin felt cleaner and softer and it is a better way to get off the makeup. It seemed to work well. It was easy to use and came with two brushes. It looks nice and is not too big or obtrusive. It is good for daily use or to use just when you need it. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like the Phillips Skin cleansing system but i prefer the Olay system that i have been using for two years now. I find the Phllips a little awkward to hold and reach all the areas of my face, neck and upper chest area. i don&#x27;t understand why this unit is so expensive and for that i deducted 1 star.</li>
    <li> Excellent convenient long lasting device to really clean the skin and the pores. The attachment pieces may be on the higher cost side but it does well in investing in one or two since they last a good few months. I often use it while showering and washing the face and then applying face cleaner afterwards. It really feels much better than using a rough towel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleaning system on my face once each night for a couple of weeks now, and I really do like it. The single speed with the soft brush and the one minute timer combine together to clean my skin without over-drying it or having to use an alternative scrubber. I wet the brush with warm water, squirt one pumpful of my favorite liquid cleanser on the brush, turn it on, and move the handheld wand over my skin. The timer does stop for a second after 20 seconds to alert you to move to another area, but I ignore that as I have my own track to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft brush feels gentle on my skin and all of my makeup (including mascara) was removed within the one minute of cleansing. I splash my face with water to remove the traces of cleanser and pat dry. Then I rinse the brush in warm water and set aside to dry. The unit comes with a charger (the plug to the AC is way too large to keep plugged in) and one charge has lasted me for over 2 weeks. You can leave the unit upright in the charger station to dry or just set it somewhere else on your counter, in the cabinet, or a drawer. The cordless wand has an off/on push button and it&#x27;s a little large, but not heavy, so is easy to maneuver around your face. It&#x27;s also waterproof, so you can also use it while you are in the shower or tub (of course you would not put the charger near or in water). It comes with an extra brush head to use as an exfoliator if desired, but I found that one a bit too abrasive to my skin and so I don&#x27;t use it. You can obtain refill brushes when necessary directly from Philips or Amazon.com or other retail outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a couple of other systems similar to this in the past, but I am quite satisfied with this one and hope that it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a beautifully sleek, technologically simlpl, and ergonomically comfortable skin cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PureRadiance charges atop a small base, with a compact, classic upright design requiring only the most moderate of counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing discs included feature a once per week  exfoliator, and a daily cleanser. They are simple to replace, so vibrant, clean, and healthy skin is never a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PureRadiance cleansing system is gentle, and using its brushes feels much more comfortable, and is far more effective than scrubbing away with a terry washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Philips PureRadiance Skin Cleansing System. Its reliably lasting charge, and its beautifully unique design make this tool a pleasure to utilize. Fantastic results take little time to achieve, using this quality-built cleansing solution.</li>
    <li> I have been curious about facial cleaning brushes for awhile.  This one comes with the wand, a regular brush head, an exfoliating brush head (not in Canada), a stand, and a charger.  The wand can be used in the shower or out of it.  One charge lasts 30 uses, according to the manual, but I&#x27;ve used it more than 30 times without needing to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system is very easy to use.  It auto shuts off so that you don&#x27;t use it too long, even.  It is also easy to clean - just run it under hot water after use and briefly dry it with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed some improvement over my usual hands-on cleaning.  My skin is very soft and my period acne was less intense than usual.</li>
    <li> The device is basically a brush that rotates and pulses to clean the skin. It charges fast, and one charge lasts for a weeks. It is comfortable to hold. It does not take much space on the counter while charging, and it can be used in the shower. When I first got it, I was almost sure that the normal brush head will be too rough for me since I have very sensitive skin, so I ordered the [[ASIN:B00MUG3HS4 Philips PureRadiance Extra Sensitive Skin Brush Head]], and was glad I did - the normal skin brush was too painful to use. The extra sensitive brush head is much better for me, no pain and no irritation. My face is very oily and flaky, so sometimes I need to go over some areas again, but it feels like the device cleans my face very well, much better then I do it, and is very gentle. It makes  my skin feel smoother and I have much less flakiness all over. I like that it can be used in the shower - I put a conditioner or hair treatment on my hair and use the device while my hair is being treated, too.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried another kind of cleaner ([[ASIN:B007VOJJ8C Sonic Cleansing Brush BrightTherapy Professional Sonic Skin Care System Waterproof]]) that would only pulse with no rotation, to see if it is more gentle and effective, but found I like Philips device better, it feels like it is more thorough while still being gentle enough.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Clairsonic. I actually like this one better. I have aging skin that is thinning and increasingly fragile. I just felt like the Clairsonic was too harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Pure Radiance charged quickly. The regular brush was very invigorating without being to harsh for my skin. The exfoliating brush was not too harsh either. It did a nice job of cleaning and freshening my skin. I felt like both brushes made my skin brighter and stimulated the circulation. My skin was immaculately clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this brush was a very comfortable experience. My only complaint is that the base and charging cord can come apart. Other than that it feels very sturdy and I am really thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the skin cleansing system for more than a week now.  I have very sensitive skin and found that the exfoliating brush was simply too much for my skin.  However, my husband has regular skin and has used the brush and really likes how his skin feels afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the regular brush works well as an exfoliating brush for my skin.  I was using it once a day and it made my skin a little too dry afterwards.  I am going to back off with this brush and only use it once per week.  I just discovered that Philips makes both a sensitive and an extra-sensitive brush as an additional purchase and I plan to pick that those up in hopes that I can use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system works well and my skin seems softer.  I&#x27;m not sure how much brighter it is but there seems to be less older skin on the surface, so hopefully that equates to brighter.  My husband really likes the two brushes that came with the set, so those two will be his.  With my skin, I&#x27;m okay with the regular brush and could continue to use it but I hope that the two that are for my skin type will work even better.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty neat little machine. I love that is has an auto shut-off timer. This is great because I think a lot of people, myself included, often over-use cleaning tools like this one. The directions are to clean each of three zones on your face for 20 seconds, for a total cleansing time of one minute. It is really quite clever how it works. The machine runs for a minute, but at twenty second intervals it pauses for a second so you know it’s time to move to the other cleansing zone. I really appreciate that this is designed to use with your existing cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this is rechargeable, so I don’t have to worry about changing batteries. One thing I found unusual was the fact that you are not supposed to constantly charge. The instructions explicitly say that you should only charge it when needed and otherwise it should not be kept charging.&lt;br /&gt;It is safe for use in the bath or shower, so that is pretty cool. It’s very easy to clean and travels well. So far, I’m enjoying the machine. It actually takes me less time to clean my face because when I was manually applying cleanser, I was rubbing for longer than a minute and I don’t think I was being as effective. It was also not as enjoyable. This is like a mini facial every morning.</li>
    <li> With this item you receive a brush that goes around in circles to assist with cleaning your facial skin.  When charged, you should get about 7 days&#x27; worth of use.  It&#x27;s waterproof so you can use it while showering/bathing.  You&#x27;ll have to see if the brushes that come with it are too rough for your skin and if they are, you can order the sensitive head for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this I feel like I&#x27;ve actually cleansed my skin, unlike before when I used my hands or a rag.  It&#x27;s a worthy investment.</li>
    <li> So far I am loving this skin cleansing tool. I am really appreciating my bathroom more as a spa with the cleaning system for facials, foot spa amd jacuzzi tub. My skin is looking better already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a brush based skincare device for a long time but have never quite felt up to the cost. My skin is on the sensitive and reactive side so finding the right one could be a costly endevour. I happened to get this one for review and it&#x27;s done a great job of selling me on the concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it only included the Normal and Exfoliating head I can only comment on them at this point. I&#x27;ve been using the Normal head and have found that I cannot use it more than every third day or my skin gets dry and stripped feeling. It does, however, amazing things for my skin overall. My nose tends to be an area I get disgusting blackheads that nothing else has done a great job of tackling without irritating my skin. This has done a wonderful job of making them less bothersome and overall less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after use my skin tends to look very dewy and brighter overall. Since I&#x27;m happy with the results I think I will switch to the Sensitive or Extra Sensitive heads now that my initial testing period is over.</li>
    <li> Philips PureRadiance Skin Cleansing System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently diagnosed by my dermatologist with a mild Rosacea and was given some skin treatments to help. I am using one of them with the Philips System. It works wonderfully and makes the drudgery of applying special creams easy. I’m a guy and not used to the makeup routine so anything that makes this type of treatment easy is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the device, it is a rechargeable wand with a spinning soft brush head that also uses their Sonic technology. After you assemble it all and charge it up you place a little cream on the brush, press the button and away you go. It divides your treatment into three zones, left and right face and forehead. The wand, like the toothbrush buzzes to let you know to move to the next zone. In use it is very quiet and very gentle, using the standard or daily brush. There is a second brush with a strip in the bristles to indicate a stronger exfoliating brush for one a week use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My impression is I’m noticing an improvement I didn’t notice with the creams alone. I need to see the doctor to check my progress but I see a difference. I’m happy with that, being easy to use helps. I’m very satisfied with the product and the improvement to my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for 3 weeks and I really like how smooth it makes my skin feel.  I use it in the evening with a small amount of my facial soap to remove all my makeup (except for eyes).  My skin feels as clean as it does using a face cloth, but I use less soap and I like the smooth feel that the brushes give me. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or breakouts.  The system doesn&#x27;t take much power to operate and comes with a recharger, which I haven&#x27;t had to use yet.  So you can keep the recharger in a drawer until you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the regular brush and the exfoliating one. But it&#x27;s nice to have the two brushes.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using the Philips PureRadiance Skin Cleansing System for about a month, and she loves it. The system comes with 2 cleaning heads (one for daily cleaning and one for deeper weekly cleaning), and is rechargeable. My wife says it does a great job at cleaning her skin and removing her makeup while still being gentle on her skin due to the unique sonic technology. It is also water resistant, so getting it wet isn&#x27;t an issue either. It comes with a drying pedestal too. Optional brush heads for extra sensitive skin and deep pore cleaning are also available on Amazon. The Philips PureRadiance Skin Cleansing System is well designed and works very well.</li>
    <li> I will admit that before receiving the Philips PureRadiance Skin Cleansing System I rarely washed my face before bed. My nighttime routine has always been bathroom, brush, floss, rinse and hop into bed!  Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, but it&#x27;s never bothered me and I always get compliments on my skin so why change?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I received this I read over the instructions and decided to start using it that night.  I was surprised at how basic it was; it only recommends 20 seconds on three different areas of your face and it even gives you a quick pause to let you know to move on.  1 minute a night?  I could do that.  So now that I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month, I found that I&#x27;m actually still using it at least 5 nights a week which surprised me because I thought I might lose interest.  But the fact is it kind feels good and my skin looks just as good as before if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with one normal brush and also a weekly exfoliating brush, which I actually didn&#x27;t care for. The replacement brushes aren&#x27;t cheap especially since they recommend replacing them every 3 months, but there are different styles (sensitive, deep pore, etc.).  As for me I&#x27;ll probably just keep using the included brush until I think it&#x27;s ready which is hopefully longer than 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I like the results I have achieved.  I am thirty something and still have acne breakouts now and then.  The PureRadiance did give my face a nice clean feel and felt soft when using.  It only takes a minute to clean and I used it with my normal daily face wash.  I wet my face, rub the face wash in and used this to get it clean.  It feels cleaner after using this, and does not make my face feel harsh like exfoliating scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is my skin brighter and more beautiful?  I wouldn&#x27;t say so, but it feels cleaner and I have not had a breakout since using it.  It&#x27;s a wand style and is easy to hold.  It&#x27;s light, and can get wet, just don&#x27;t submerge it in water, and do not use in the shower.  I only use this at night because washing my face too many times drys me out.  So far I am happy with it.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> We have used several similar brushes before but this is the most advance with combined sonic and rotating actions.  It came with two brushes, a regular brush with softer and bristles and the exfoliating brush for removing dead skin cells.  The later is used twice a week while the regular one is used every night.  Just to warn you, the exfoliating brush may feel uncomfortable after first use, but you can really feel your face is fresher and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to fumble and keep replacing batteries.  It came with a built-in rechargeable battery.  It charges buy induction so don&#x27;t worry much about touching any of the battery terminal contacts.  It fully charges in about 6 hours which is good for 30 uses.  The brush automatically shut-off after a minute which is all you need to completely clean the major areas on your face.  You can turn it on again if so desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PureRadiance is waterproof so you can bring it in the shower if you want to.</li>
    <li> This is my first facial cleaning system using a brush. My skin is very sensitive and I was afraid at first that the system&#x27;s brushes (you get two--a normal brush and an exfoliation brush) would be too rough on my skin, but those fears were soon put to rest with use. I have used this a couple of times a week for the last several weeks and I do see a difference in my skin. The first week I only used the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush and after a few days my skin was fine so I tried the exfoliation brush. Again this was also fine in terms of my skin not being red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their own skin system. As I&#x27;ve aged my skin has become more sensitive and has experienced more break outs as it goes through aging. I use Retin A once a week and then a few days after that I use the normal brush and the day after I use the exfoliation brush. The four days that I&#x27;m not using the Retin A and the brush system I use my normal skincare routine and so far my break outs are fewer and my skin is smoother. I&#x27;m going to try using the normal brush a bit more, but with my skin this may be too much of a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this item!</li>
    <li> If I had to guess, you might be reading this because this PureRadiance is over half the price of the Clarisonic (cordless). And while that might seem pretty appealing, the difference is stark. I have used Clarisonic for over three years now. At the highest setting, the Clarisonic is a powerful machine that does not merely clean your face, but it makes it more receptive to the products you apply after. I did inquire with my dermatologist if these claims were valid. She enthusiastically agreed and endorsed its use (she does not sell the device in her office and had no reason to promote it other than the health of her patients). Once you use the Clarisonic, there is NO going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head here is awkward in comparison to the Clarisonic. It seems to takes considerably longer to use this (to cover the same area with the same care as the Clarisonic). And, it seems that the &amp;#34;gentle rotations&amp;#34; are a ploy to appease those who do not initially understand the Clarisonic. (The Clarisonic employs sonic technology exclusively ... this can lead to a little consumer confusion. However, once the consumer commits to the routine, he/she realizes is the same principle with the Sonicare toothbrush ... which leads to a superior &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand and charging device feel a little on the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; side as compared to Clarisonic. (And, it really is half the cost, so I think this is expected). Moreover, it is considerably less ergonomic than it appears (and, of course, in comparison to the Clarisonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the lack of power (which does not even approach that of my Clarisonic) makes this a non-option. If at all possible, just spring for the Clarisonic. I realize how pricey it is; therefore, if the cordless Clarisonic is not feasible, try the Clarisonic Mia (which is a little less convenient, but it still effective). Once you use it, you will feel lost without it! Imagine going back to a manual toothbrush! Now, you get it;)</li>
    <li> Very good, love the product!! Worth to buy!</li>
    <li> i was skeptical once i got it, because for one, it&#x27;s so small, and i thought, this will never work.  But boy was i wrong, it&#x27;s small and it fits in all the hard to reach places that the bigger brushed devices can&#x27;t get into (around nose, between eyebrows, neck area front &amp; back, ears).  It is very powerful and i love to just glide it across my face and see the brush go to work, i am also a clarisonic user, but am for the moment hooked on this because it seems to be more efficient.</li>
    <li> The Philips PureRadiance is a great product and is extremely easy to use. I charged it for the 6 hours like it stated in the user manual before use and then gave it a try. The brush is soft and works really well for lightly massaging your face while cleaning at the same time. The built-in timer that pauses to let you know it&#x27;s time to move on to a different part of your face is a nice added perk so that you don&#x27;t spend too much time on one area. You can also use whatever face cleaner you would like with it. It&#x27;s done a great job of everyday washing and even washing off make-up on the days when I wear it. It was also great that I could use this while in the shower and didn&#x27;t have to worry about it getting wet since they have made it water safe. Overall I&#x27;ve had a great experience with it personally so far, and wouldn&#x27;t see any reason not to recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was curious to review this since I&#x27;ve also owned the Clarisonic Mia 2 for a little over a year and wanted to see how they would compare.  After using them these two, they both seem to do a better job of cleaning my sensitive, dry skin than a wash cloth or my fingers alone alone.  Both also do it without exacerbating my skin&#x27;s sensitivity or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I personally prefer the Clarisonic over this model because the brushes are easier to find and because I like the feel of it on my skin better.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they both do a good job of cleaning, but the Clarisonic feels more pleasant on the skin like getting a facial.  I also find the Clarisonic to be more comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of personal preference I prefer the Clarisonic, but I think this is another viable option for leaving skin cleaner than just using your fingers.</li>
    <li> This cleansing brush is very nice ! I love the design and the color and it is very effective. If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use it everyday because this type of cleaning system is so powerful than it could irritate your skin more than needed ! You can use this brush with any type of cleanser you used to apply : foam, cream and even a scrub ! Your skin is very well washed and ready for all your other skin care !&lt;br /&gt;Love it !</li>
    <li> This is a good version of the more famous and more expensive clairisonic and it does the same thing. I like the smaller size, Needs to be charged when you get it.</li>
    <li> When I go out of the house, I typically always put makeup on. For most of the year I wear Revlon&#x27;s Liquid Colorstay Foundation (except when I finally get some color on my face in the summer, then I use mineral makeup). The colorstay makeup does exactly what it says it does, it stays. I can go swimming with it on and my foundation doesn&#x27;t come off. It requires soap to break it down and wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with my makeup working so well at staying put, my face needs a good scrubbing to remove it all. Just basic face wash and water doesn&#x27;t remove everything. It will look like my skin is clean, but if I use an exfoliant to scrub with afterwards, it will show there&#x27;s still makeup left behind. I have had two other face brush cleansing systems in the past. I have a DDF Revolve Micro-Polishing System, which runs about the same price as this Philips skin cleansing system, and I have a cheaper cheap Fyola Cleansing System (no Clarisonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three of these systems have good features about them. The Fyola system uses a wireless charging system (and is half the price of my other two face cleansing systems). It uses a pulsing ultrasonic type of movement to clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older DDF system uses regular batteries that need replaced, and it does not have any kind of pulse or ultrasonic movement. And instead works by just spinning the brushes around in a circular motion. However it comes with a nice foam pad attachment (in addition to various brushes) that can be used with an exfoliating scrub to deeply scrub skin. Using that foam pad attachment with the DDF micro-derma crystals scrub is the most intense exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever gotten. It feels like you could scrape off paint from a car with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Philips system comes with something unique as well, a new kind of scrubbing technology. The brush both rotates and pulses at the same time. So instead of having to choose either a cleansing system that pulsates or rotates, you get both with this system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I happen to really like the design of this PureRadiance system. Having two other systems that are shaped and designed in the style of the Clarisonic system (just smaller), I found this system different, and I liked it. I like the shape and angle of the cleaner. It&#x27;s easy to hold and it looks nicer set out on the counter in the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my other two face cleaning systems I&#x27;ve been letting my two teens use. My son gets extremely clogged pours, but just on his nose. No basic washing helps at all. He has to use something that scrubs hard, so he&#x27;s using the DDF system with the foam pads and the polishing crystals. My daughter has more typical teen acne issues, with combination oily skin and dry flaking skin in the T-zone and long the sides of her face. But she doesn&#x27;t wear any foundation, just a tiny bit of powder sometimes. So the she uses the Fyola system, which works well for her since it&#x27;s just a pulsating system and is very gentle on her skin. And I&#x27;m using this Philips system for deep cleaning my colorstay makeup off my skin. It works great for my skin and I love how well it removes every last bit of makeup.system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I happen to really like the design of this PureRadiance system. Having two other systems that are shaped and designed in the style of the Clarisonic system (just smaller), I found this system different, and I liked it. I like the shape and angle of the cleaner.

    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s review:-  This is easy to use and really makes my skin feel good.  I like the way in which the cleaner stows away when not in use.  It would have been nice to have had some extra brush heads - but I guess I can always go and buy the ones I need.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my Clarisonic died right after the warranty was up. I decided that I wanted a product that had a longer warranty and was backed by a good reputation. Since I have had several different Philips Sonicare toothbrushes, I specifically sought out a sonic face brush by Philips. I like how this brush is more gentle on the nose area and that it spins in circles in addition to the sonic waves. I prefer this design over the Clarisonic. The small shape is easier to hold while using; it also has a stand that helps the brush to dry when not in use and allows the device to take up less counter space than the Clarisonic. However, I wouldn&#x27;t say this is better than the Clarisonic since they are both different products with different features, but it works great for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and I love it! It is easy to use, takes only a minute and provides great results. I don&#x27;t wear make up and I have been blessed with good skin, but am now 46 and age is starting to show. From the first use my skin felt smoother and softer and appears less dull. The brush head needs to be replaced every 3 months and cost about $20 apiece. Brushes are available in regular, sensitive, extra sensitive and exfoliating. A regular brush and one replacement come with the machine. Cleanser is not included, but you can use any kind you choose, so no need to change if you like what you already have.</li>
    <li> Really love this cleansing brush!!! it cleans well, and the buterry last longer than Mia2. Also travel-friendly because of light weight.</li>
    <li> Upon first using this, I was surprised how soft the brush bristles actually are.  It seemed like they&#x27;d be pretty aggressive, but that&#x27;s far from the reality.  I haven&#x27;t tried the exfoliating one yet, though.  The interesting thing on that one is that the grey bristles are actually set back into the brush a bit more than the white ones.  The heads are easy to pop on and off, and each comes with its own cap, and the cap also has air vents.  Therefore, you could easily share one main unit among more than one person.  Within a couple days my teenage daughter confiscated it and is now the primary user, and she really likes using it.  It is more convenient for her to clean her face multiple times a day, and it makes a lot less mess than trying to do face washes by hand or with a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the timer feature works well to prompt you to move on to the next area, I wish it had a customizable length of time.  I found 20 seconds a bit less than what I&#x27;d want to do, but two full cycles a bit long.  While the rotation is very apparent, you can&#x27;t feel the sonic pulses.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily a bad thing, but just thought I&#x27;d point it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand works well and doubles as the charger.  What I don&#x27;t like about that is that its a bit inconvenient if you don&#x27;t have room for the cord to be attached all the time, and since you can&#x27;t charge the unit directly, if you&#x27;re travelling you have to take the stand with you.  That&#x27;s the main reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars to this.</li>
