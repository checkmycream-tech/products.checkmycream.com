<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this product on and off for years.  Can not find in all stores but was surprised to find it on Amazon and way less money.</li>
    <li> I really am happy with this night cream. I haven&#x27;t been using it for a REALLY long time- but for the time I&#x27;ve been using it I&#x27;ve been very happy.  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and leaves it feeling baby soft.  Moisturized but not greasy AT ALL! I&#x27;m super happy with this product.  A great night cream without breaking the bank</li>
    <li> I received this night cream as a gift, along with some Oil of Olay Regenerist products (saved me alot of $$). I immediately took to the Loreal product over  Oil of Olay&#x27;s to my surprise. I LOVED the scent--very fresh, similar to freshly-sliced cucumber--over Olay&#x27;s flowery-scented creams that remind me of a grandma perfume(yuck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is non-greasy; a combination between an gel and cream texture, that creates a transparent, thin film when applied. This thin application absorbs fully after a couple minutes without any oily feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels moisturized and soft, and smells great. I look forward to using this product every day, while the oil of Olay Regenerist products are sitting there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price here on Amazon, I would definitely opt for this Skin Genesis night cream over Olay, and will buy it when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this stuff! I first got it in my christmas stocking a few years ago, it lasted almost 5 months and diminished my big pores, reduced overall oil and made my skin look and feel moisturized and radiant. I tried to get this for months from CVS in my neighborhood, but they were always out of stock, or sold out or they stopped carrying it. I finally looked on Amazon, and was suprized to find it for sale. Its very affordable here on amazon, it cost under $4, but the shipping is what gets you...even still, It was supposed to sell for $17 at cvs, that is if they ever got it on the shelf. Even at $17 it does a great job measuring up tot more expensive creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love the smell, texture, amount, longevity, and performance of this lotion, Its WONDERFUL!  DOn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it, its soooooo worth it!</li>
    <li> I received this item today 8/30/2011 and it looked a bit battered. When I opened the box there was a manufacturer&#x27;s coupon with an expiry date of 5/31/09. Seriously?! If the coupon is that old I don&#x27;t want to know how old the product itself is. There is NO way I&#x27;m putting this on my skin. I went to The Value Bay&#x27;s storefront and between the 5 star reviews (hmmm I wonder who wrote those?) I found other complaints from people that had received expired products from this seller. If this product is ever offered directly from Amazon I&#x27;d definitely buy it but I will NOT purchase anything that comes from The Value Bay again. Amazon was great when I contacted them and gave me a full refund. The Value Bay&#x27;s expired skin creme is going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Product is OK.  A decent moisturizer. Price is OK...but the container is deceiving.  The product is 1.7 oz only for 9.00. I use it as day mouisturizer under/in place of make-up. Won&#x27;t do anything \\&quot;unique\\&quot; for your skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis Day Moisturizer.  Was happy to find both on Amazon as I cannot find in stores anymore.  Received within timeframe.</li>
    <li> I love this product and i recommend it to every one,it&#x27;s help me to reduce the fine lines and even out tone of my skin,it&#x27;s already 3-th bottle im using and will continue to use.One thing i recommend thou,when the cream is finish  need to crack the top lid because a lot of cream stocking between the plastic layers you can use it another week )))</li>
    <li> I actually noticed a difference in my skin right away.  Using a night time product has improved the hydration to my skin and has lifted the eyelid area and decreased the wrinkles around the eye.  I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I think they know you will buy more than one with that prices, so u wiil get both good and bad items. They are not stupid to sell at this tempting prices for nothing, i believe. Prepare for unexpected sides after u open the delivery.</li>
    <li> I read some comments about this item \\&quot;old\\&quot; and \\&quot;has expired\\&quot;. I didn&#x27;t believe it until I received my own. I was very disappointed because the outside box was very old and dirty, and even had marks on it. To my surprise, the tape on the box has been broken which means someone else has opened it before reaching me! And I can&#x27;t find the expiring date on either the outside box or on the bottle of the cream. So I don&#x27;t dare to use it.</li>
    <li> I am not 100% pleased with the product just because I was hoping the product would have better results, but I also stopped using it consistently and it may have needed longer to work. I do think that it was worth the buy for me. I have sensitive skin but this does not bother it or cause acne. It has visibly decreased my pore size on my face, which I think is the cause for my reduced blackheads. I am not afraid to put this over blackheads, as it seems to aid healing rather than causing more clogged pores. It has evened out and reduced discoloring on some patches of scarred skin. It also is a good way to keep my skin moist through these dry winter nights without being greasy or too moist! A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Again I have reviewed most the items in the line because I am using them all together. This lotion is light weight for a night lotion which I love. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy in the morning like some, and you do not need a lot so this bottle will last a while.. I recommend the whole line if your going to try this. They are made to work together not really to much on their own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Skin Genesis Night serum for long time, very good product, I will recomend to everyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> My mom is 58 year old, and she loves it. She said every time she put it on, she felt the facial skin is tight, less wrinkle, skin tone shining. She asked me ordered 5 packets total up to now.</li>
    <li> This cream is good as far as not being greasy as so many are.  I use also as a day cream.</li>
    <li> Loreal is my top two skin care preference and this product just proves my point. After every use, I wake up to healthier  skin. It leaves it soft and hydrated. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Helps my skin look younger and healthier.  Easy to use. No greasey after feel.  No mess on the pillow cases.</li>
    <li> This cream felt greasy after application and didn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed. It also had an unpleasant chemical scent -almost like sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I know that I said that I&#x27;d never use any other cream on my face but my regular creams, but this product is something special. It feels like a luxury cream, an expensive cream, a cell rejuvenater, but at such a low price, its crazy! I&#x27;ve now added this serum into my nightly regimen. I definitely recommend this serum to all women who are concerned about anti-aging. The product arrived on time and with no transaction problems.  .Bernadette Ostrawski.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin year round.  That being said I find this my go-to daily moisturizer.  Although I admit my absolute favorite is Loreal&#x27;s Youth Code moisturizer, the price of this product is much more reasonable for everyday.  I have not seen it any cheaper than here on amazon.com and the product I received here was just as fine quality as the product I purchased from the drug store. It&#x27;s smooth and light and results are able to be seen after a week or two.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I could see a difference in my skin after the first use!  I would definitely recommend this product and this seller!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for my skin type. would not order again.  Don&#x27;t think it was the product</li>
    <li> This seems to work very well.  It feels wonderful under the eyes and just a tiny dab under each eye, lightly smoothed along, is more than enough.  I would recommend this to others and will definitely purchase again.  I still have plenty left, so that should show how long it lasts as I believe I purchased it around Christmastime.</li>
    <li> SELLER :CLEAR SKIN SOURCE STOREFRONT  sent me Loreal Skin Genesis night Cream which EXPIRED 3 YEARS AGO!!!! The inside coupon was good til 05/31/09.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the night cream to ruin my skin. I can&#x27;t believe CLEAR SKIN SOURCE STOREFRONT had a gut to sell such item!!!!!!!!!!! I wonder if CLEAR SKIN SOURCE STOREFRONT uses the cream that old.  The cream I bought is going down to my TRASH CAN. What a waste of my money......</li>
    <li> The product arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.  I love the feel of this nighttime face cream, and I can definitely see and feel the difference in my skin.  Great product and great service; well done!</li>
    <li> Wasta of money after 2 weeks i saw no improvement. i feel totally ripped off. However i use L&#x27;oreal Paris AGE PERFECT Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm with wonderful results. Do you have any coupons?</li>
    <li> Really works with my sensitive ginger skin.  Helps to take away red skin reactions I get with my allergies. Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Gets those crow&#x27;s feet.....good stuff.  You only need a little drop to go a long way.  My highest recommendations on this one.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Really firms up the lines around the eyes and face. Better than what Loreal has out there now. Don&#x27;t know why they discontinued this product. If you can find it grab it!</li>
    <li> Its a bit thick, but its been a great night cream so far. I tend to use sn exfoliator at night and then use the night cream. Its a very simple routine but I have pretty clear skin. I mostly use it as a early defense against aging. After all, I&#x27;m almost 25!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get the item.  I opened it only to be more excited for an additional coupon inside...which unfortunately expired in 2009.  I have to assume the lotion also is from the past decade.  Thinking that is why it smells a little off.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed when I received the item.  It was outdated, confirmed by the coupon in the box that is dated 2009!!!  The bar code on the product&#x27;s box was covered up by other labels.</li>
    <li> works very well. after I got it, I mailed it to my sister in China, she said it was much better than what she bought from Chinese market.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and good for combination to oily skin. It&#x27;s not too creamy making my skin more oily. It smells good and it feels good.</li>
    <li> This is without doubt the BEST NIGHT TREATMENT around. Save your bucks ladies - I use SKII, Dermalogica and Josie Moran and this stuff is amazing! Impossible to find in Asia and Australia so get it where you can.</li>
    <li> Why is that every time I find something I really like they discontinue it??! So frustrating. Wish they would bring it back.</li>
