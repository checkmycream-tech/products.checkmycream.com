      <li>Amazing scent!</li>
      <li>When i sprayed it, i got a remarkable comment that made me feel O.K. about it.</li>
      <li>All good, way cheaper than store</li>
      <li>Good product, seller and packaging.</li>
      <li>Just smells really good.</li>
      <li>Every time he puts it on,  I ask him what he&#x27;s wearing because it smells so good.</li>
      <li>I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice fragrance and a good price for the size of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I priced at the Ferragamo web site for $80 and found here on my favorite place AMAZON!</li>
      <li>Fantastic scent and a great price here.</li>
      <li>One of my favorites, this smells so good, all the girls love it</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this myself, but it&#x27;s a nice acquatic if that&#x27;s something you presently don&#x27;t own or would like to have.</li>
      <li>nice perfume, nice packaging</li>
      <li>I feel it&#x27;s more of an evening cologne.</li>
      <li>its an item that I will buy again for sure</li>
      <li>2007 version, with perhaps a bit more lavender.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>At all, I love it.</li>
      <li>I love  to smell  this  on my  man.</li>
      <li>i love the hints of lemon in it</li>
      <li>Smells nice and clean.</li>
      <li>This is a good smell for those scorching hot days.....</li>
      <li>For the price you get a really good sized bottle and the scent is really noticeable....</li>
      <li>Nice fresh scent to it.</li>
      <li>The bottle itself which was 3.4 ounce sold for almost close to 100 bucks at Macy&#x27;s, the cologne is genuine and not a knockoff.</li>
      <li>The scent is clean and aquatic.</li>
      <li>last all day and smells really good.</li>
      <li>beats most of these smelly products out there by far.  </li>
      <li>the realm of acquatic fragrances, this is basically white noise, but it&#x27;s still nice nonetheless: It&#x27;s been virtually done to death.  </li>
      <li>but it was well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see much people wearing this which makes it somewhat unique.</li>
      <li>It is good for an aquatic but like most aquatics the smell fades pretty quickly and projection is weak.</li>
      <li>only cologne I have ever bought more than once.</li>
      <li>I first smelled it at Dillard&#x27;s and they were asking about $90 for a 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s all that really matters!</li>
      <li>for of course less :) so i splurged and bought it!</li>
      <li>Light enough for the day and strong enough for the evening (ESP in the summertime).</li>
      <li>At almost half the price, you can enjoy the original fragrance.</li>
      <li>but this is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I then came home and decided i really should just buy it.</li>
      <li>, even my ex couldn&#x27;t help but to stand real close to me hah.</li>
      <li>I think Nautica Voyage is a better deal than this for A LOT less money....</li>
      <li>Funny enough</li>
      <li>I first smelled this cologne at a local Macys establishment.</li>
      <li>This is a major steal!!!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the purchase i made, the product arrived a little late</li>
      <li>I went to the Ferragamo store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills a few weeks back and smelled this in store and said right away &amp;#34;Oh my God, you have to smell this it smells</li>
      <li>, i love it so much i debated on writing a bad review</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband bought this. It smells very good.</li>
    <li> All good, way cheaper than store</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for your money! I first smelled it at Dillard&#x27;s and they were asking about $90 for a 3.4 oz bottle. At almost half the price, you can enjoy the original fragrance. Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> It reminds me of the ocean. This is a good smell for those scorching hot days.....I wouldn&#x27;t classify this as a date fragrance or a night time scent. It is good for an aquatic but like most aquatics the smell fades pretty quickly and projection is weak. You can use a lot of this with little worry...... I think Nautica Voyage is a better deal than this for A LOT less money....</li>
    <li> came the day it said so happy there and it smells great i love the hints of lemon in it</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Just what I was  looking for</li>
    <li> I love  to smell  this  on my  man.</li>
    <li> My son loves it! Thank you! Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> my lady loves the smell</li>
    <li> For the price you get a really good sized bottle and the scent is really noticeable.... beats most of these smelly products out there by far.  I am very pleased with the purchase i made, the product arrived a little late but it was well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Good product, seller and packaging. The smell is same as the one that I bought before from Macy&#x27;s with 80$. Also the smell remain on my clothes for long time. At all, I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest ever. I got a sample bottle from a store and it smelled great so I havd to get the big bottle. People always said the cologne is fake and don&#x27;t last long but this is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent! Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> great for any occasion. last all day and smells really good. Service was excellent. its an item that I will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> My husband wanted to build up his Cologne collection and this is one of the fragrances I chose for  him. Every time he puts it on,  I ask him what he&#x27;s wearing because it smells so good. Nice fresh scent to it. Light enough for the day and strong enough for the evening (ESP in the summertime).</li>
    <li> I went to the Ferragamo store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills a few weeks back and smelled this in store and said right away &amp;#34;Oh my God, you have to smell this it smells amazing!&amp;#34; to whom i went with and they agreed. I then came home and decided i really should just buy it. I priced at the Ferragamo web site for $80 and found here on my favorite place AMAZON! for of course less :) so i splurged and bought it! I LOVE IT, i love it so much i debated on writing a bad review just so no one else would buy it, LOL Funny enough it i would have waited a few days one of the friedns i went to the store with actually bought it for me as a gift for a job well done! So now i have two bottles. Oh darn!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites, this smells so good, all the girls love it, even my ex couldn&#x27;t help but to stand real close to me hah.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality. Item arrived earlier than I expected. I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> When i sprayed it, i got a remarkable comment that made me feel O.K. about it.That&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve used as headline.It also lasts longer than i&#x27;ve expected!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice fragrance and a good price for the size of the bottle. However, it&#x27;s not something that I would purchase again once I go through this bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend as a gift. That&#x27;s amazing smell and he loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and clean.</li>
    <li> He loved this !!! And the price was great!!! No more buying at the department store !!!</li>
    <li> nice perfume, nice packaging</li>
    <li> Smell nothing like my last bottle of same item very unhappy</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this spray, it was a waste of money. It will last about 30 minutes and then it&#x27;s like you never had it on. I wish I could send it back, but guess what? yup, no returns. GRRRR!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised by this one don&#x27;t spend your money at Macy&#x27;s or Norstrom&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Got it for Christmas from my wife and she loves it. and that&#x27;s all that really matters!</li>
    <li> Acqua Essenziale is a typical acquatic. The opening notes are lemon and basil and smell virtually indistinguishable from Ermenegildo Zegna&#x27;s Acqua d&#x27;Estate Essenza 2007 version, with perhaps a bit more lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heart of the fragrance is basically lavender and acquatic notes and it just slowly disappears from here. Sillage and longevity are what you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the realm of acquatic fragrances, this is basically white noise, but it&#x27;s still nice nonetheless: It&#x27;s been virtually done to death.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this myself, but it&#x27;s a nice acquatic if that&#x27;s something you presently don&#x27;t own or would like to have.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this cologne at a local Macys establishment. The scent is clean and aquatic. Smells great and I don&#x27;t see much people wearing this which makes it somewhat unique. The bottle itself which was 3.4 ounce sold for almost close to 100 bucks at Macy&#x27;s, the cologne is genuine and not a knockoff. Save money purchasing this cologne here and not at a department store. This is a major steal!!!</li>
    <li> only cologne I have ever bought more than once. third bottle now</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent and a great price here.</li>
    <li> Just smells really good. Always get compliments. I feel it&#x27;s more of an evening cologne.</li>
    <li> Bought this cologne as a gift to myself at a great price compared to Macys . Give it a try you wont be disappointed .</li>
