      <li>This is the best and only edge control that works for my hair and I have tried them all!!!</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like it.</li>
      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>This is the BEST and most of you just need to find different ways to lay your edges instead of just putting water and slicking it with a brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I decided to try, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It works pretty good but feels a bit sticky and greasy</li>
      <li>It keeps a great hold with the right amount of sheen.&lt;br /&gt;There is some build up, but I think I may have put too much on, and didn&#x27;t brush/comb</li>
      <li>It can take those coarse and fly away edges and smooth them out like you just got your hair done.</li>
      <li>I they would sell a big jar of this great stuff.</li>
      <li>Light weight, non-greasy.</li>
      <li>Over the years I have tried many edge control products and this product really works!</li>
      <li>I was excited to try it as soon as I received</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this gel especially with all the great reviews so naturally</li>
      <li>I LOVE it absolutely.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several edge control products and I feel this one works great on natural hair.</li>
      <li>but you still need to wrap your edges other wise when the heat hits its fuzzy city.</li>
      <li>I JUST LOVE JIREH WILL BE DOING MORE OF IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE</li>
      <li>Received this item very fast.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave residue and works my naps pretty well.  </li>
      <li>it does exactly what it says and i have already told people to buy this edge</li>
      <li>Good product but the jar is so small for the price.</li>
      <li>Good product, wasn&#x27;t prepared for how small it was.</li>
      <li>But overall I&#x27;ll stay a loyal customer until I finally find something better.</li>
      <li>It works ok not like I expected.</li>
      <li>This item really does the work.</li>
      <li>thanks again...</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Slicking down edges is a process :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This edge control really works even with natural hair</li>
      <li>I feel it&#x27;s worth trying if you are looking for something different.</li>
      <li>Ok kind of disappointed.</li>
      <li>Does not hold my natural hair in place.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work for type 4 natural hair.</li>
      <li>She has thick hair and she and her college mates love it.  </li>
      <li>My edges laid down for most of day...but not like I expected.</li>
      <li>So again maybe if you&#x27;re not active, but for me working out twice a day in the heat</li>
      <li>I previously wrote a review on this product the first day that I received it.</li>
      <li>One thing I will say is that if you are looking for an all day hold, this may not be the product for you but for me it has worked better than any other product that I have tried to slick my edges with.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing other edge control products out of the local beauty supply stores trying to find something comparable since jireh edge control isn&#x27;t in stores her in NYC and is pretty pricey for its size</li>
      <li>Jireh Edge Control lays edges down when you first apply it, but as the day for on it turns white and leaves a  White residue.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to find an edge control that really laid my edges down and lasted all day</li>
      <li>It does make my hair pretty stiff which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>

<li> I was hoping to find an edge control that really laid my edges down and lasted all day</li>
<li> It does make my hair pretty stiff which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
<li> I have natural coarse African American, I was concerned that I would not find a product to lay my edges down for a polished look.</li>
<li> my edges are completely the same and after my evening workout I can forget it holding down my hair at all.</li>
<li> edges will not lay flat.</li>
<li> I am someone who loves to wear a ponytail and with this I can have a smooth look without it looking hard from hairspray or slick from gel or grease.</li>
<li> but my expectations were dashed after trying a number of times and different way (wet hair, dry hair etc.).  </li>
<li> Jireh Edge Control did the trick and did not leave a gunky white buildup like some of the other edge control products I have used.</li>
<li> However if you are very active it may not last for days.</li>
<li> But now I have different feelings on this product after using it for a few days.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> It only takes a small amount to work.</li>
<li> OTHER THAN THAT</li>
<li> This gel does not make my edges slick not even for a second.  </li>
<li> Holds my extremely curly type 4 edges</li>
<li> Take your edge game to a new level</li>
<li> so did this part of ingredients go down after alot of people come and say yes they like it has recommended.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will hold down my edges.</li>
<li> Maybe its not ideal for natural non relaxed hair.</li>
<li> this product leaves a white residue behind after about 20minutes.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t keep edges longer then a few hours.</li>
<li> where is my other jar please!!!</li>
<li> BUT THE JAR IS SMALL</li>
<li> small jar.  </li>
<li> the reviews 2015 are saying that this product is no good anymore just a little skeptic</li>
<li> I also have course thick hair.</li>
<li> It is meant for your edges... not to slick in a pony tail!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> small jar.  Does not hold my natural hair in place.  I like to pull my hair back in a bun for work.</li>
    <li> WE Abosolutely love love love this product! It&#x27;s by far the best edge control I&#x27;ve ever used. I workout daily &amp; it controls my edges without buildup😀</li>
    <li> Product is works great but I&#x27;m not to crazy with the smell</li>
    <li> This is the best and only edge control that works for my hair and I have tried them all!!! Buy this and you will be VERY satisfied.</li>
    <li> I would like to thank you guys for creating this product. It does great on my edges I&#x27;m in love with it thanks again...</li>
    <li> Great product. Light weight, non-greasy. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been purchasing other edge control products out of the local beauty supply stores trying to find something comparable since jireh edge control isn&#x27;t in stores her in NYC and is pretty pricey for its size but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like it. It does make my hair pretty stiff which I don&#x27;t care for. But overall I&#x27;ll stay a loyal customer until I finally find something better.</li>
    <li> Good product but the jar is so small for the price.</li>
    <li> I get white flakes on hair. I don&#x27;t recommend to those with coconut allergies. My throat started to close up and I had to take benedryl and albutorol. Had to throw this away :(</li>
    <li> This product only held of 2 hours, then started to friz</li>
    <li> Take your edge game to a new level</li>
    <li> I previously wrote a review on this product the first day that I received it. But now I have different feelings on this product after using it for a few days. Do not buy, the product does not work nearly as good as it looks in the instagram pictures! This product last for about 3 minutes and then my edges frizz back up which is super annoying! Does not work what so ever.. Trust me!</li>
    <li> Good stuff  where is my other jar please!!!</li>
    <li> It works ok not like I expected. Maybe its not ideal for natural non relaxed hair. I was hoping to find an edge control that really laid my edges down and lasted all day but this one does not.</li>
    <li> This edge control is the best I ever used. It is meant for your edges... not to slick in a pony tail! If you have thick course hair put a scarf on your edges so it can hold!! You can&#x27;t expect for it to hold if you don&#x27;t make an effort! This is the BEST and most of you just need to find different ways to lay your edges instead of just putting water and slicking it with a brush. Slicking down edges is a process :)</li>
    <li> Ok kind of disappointed. I saw this on instagram and the way the video made it seem I wanted this product bad but it does work to a point but you still need to wrap your edges other wise when the heat hits its fuzzy city.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many edge control products and this product really works! It can take those coarse and fly away edges and smooth them out like you just got your hair done. It does not leave a white film as others do, and it is not sticky. It only takes a small amount to work. I am someone who loves to wear a ponytail and with this I can have a smooth look without it looking hard from hairspray or slick from gel or grease. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIVE STARS BUT THE JAR IS SMALL SO I HAVE TO HIDE THIS STUFF FROM MY DAUGHTERS OR IT WILL BE GONE WITHIN WEEKS! OTHER THAN THAT THIS PRODUCT IS EVERY THING IT SAYS IT IS.</li>
    <li> Found the product through Instagram.  I decided to try, and I love it.  It keeps a great hold with the right amount of sheen.&lt;br /&gt;There is some build up, but I think I may have put too much on, and didn&#x27;t brush/comb thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;And who can&#x27;t beat that it&#x27;s all natural!&lt;br /&gt;A great product for all Naturalistas to have :-)</li>
    <li> Jireh is the best edge controller ever.... super happy client...EdgesOnFleek</li>
    <li> Cant believe  how awesome my hair looks After jireh!!!! best edge control ever!!!! Took me a while to get over how firm the hold is on my 4c hair but UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I JUST LOVE JIREH WILL BE DOING MORE OF IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE</li>
    <li> Good product, wasn&#x27;t prepared for how small it was.</li>
    <li> Love it. Holds my extremely curly type 4 edges and I have TONS of edges. Thank you</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this gel especially with all the great reviews so naturally I was excited to try it as soon as I received but my expectations were dashed after trying a number of times and different way (wet hair, dry hair etc.).  This gel does not make my edges slick not even for a second.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> great product will be purchasing again it does exactly what it says and i have already told people to buy this edge control its the best one out!!!</li>
    <li> Jireh is a really good product. Just wish I was bale to purchase this product in a local store or from an online retailer.</li>
    <li> I have tried several edge control products and I feel this one works great on natural hair. I feel it&#x27;s worth trying if you are looking for something different.</li>
    <li> OK this edge control may work perfectly when you&#x27;re not working out twice a day in 100 degree weather. It holds perfectly at 5 a.m. but I workout from 6-7 and had to apply more. I even tried re-wetting it as some reviews recommended but to no avail. By lunch my edges are completely the same and after my evening workout I can forget it holding down my hair at all. It also has a sticky residue that burns my eyes like crazy when I sweat. So again maybe if you&#x27;re not active, but for me working out twice a day in the heat no thank you. I also have course thick hair.</li>
    <li> You have to simply try Jireh Edge Control.  I LOVE it absolutely.  My daughter also thinks it&#x27;s great.  She has thick hair and she and her college mates love it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave residue and works my naps pretty well.  Great product</li>
    <li> Love this product... Hold my edges just right!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have natural coarse African American, I was concerned that I would not find a product to lay my edges down for a polished look. Jireh Edge Control did the trick and did not leave a gunky white buildup like some of the other edge control products I have used. Very happy with the product and will order more, before it sells out!</li>
    <li> this product leaves a white residue behind after about 20minutes. the residue is extra visible and will leave you embarrassed when someone tells you, you have white stuff in your hair. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> This edge control really works even with natural hair</li>
    <li> I saw this how to go on Facebook and I wanted to try it but I&#x27;ve been looking at the reviews I see that a lot of people from 2012 recommended say that this was a good product in 2015 nobody liked it so did this part of ingredients go down after alot of people come and say yes they like it has recommended.  the reviews 2015 are saying that this product is no good anymore just a little skeptic</li>
    <li> Jireh Edge Control lays edges down when you first apply it, but as the day for on it turns white and leaves a  White residue. I used it after my braids grew out and it created build up on my edges. My edges laid down for most of day...but not like I expected. Overall I like the product and would purchase it again, I just don&#x27;t like that aspect of it.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good but feels a bit sticky and greasy</li>
    <li> flake and doesn&#x27;t hold</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep edges longer then a few hours.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for type 4 natural hair. Purchased after seeing on Instagram. It&#x27;s not any different from exostyler, etc. edges will not lay flat. It instantly curls back up. Very disappointed as I thought this would work as seen on IG videos</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It really works! However if you are very active it may not last for days.</li>
    <li> The best edge control ever.</li>
    <li> This very good edge control it stays on all day and all night until bed time. I they would sell a big jar of this great stuff.</li>
    <li> Received this item very fast. This item worked just as it was stated. I saw this item on instagram and I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will hold down my edges. This item really does the work. One thing I will say is that if you are looking for an all day hold, this may not be the product for you but for me it has worked better than any other product that I have tried to slick my edges with.</li>
