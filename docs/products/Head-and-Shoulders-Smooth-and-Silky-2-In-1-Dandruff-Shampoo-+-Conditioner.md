      <li>it is nice with this price and two shampoo were well protected when it arrived.</li>
      <li>This is a nice version of head &amp; shoulders</li>
      <li>I still use a conditioner as none of these ever seem to do the trick on my hair on their own.</li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be raving about a shampoo to help with dandruff, but I really have had an excellent experience.</li>
      <li>This smooth and silky 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner works very nicely.</li>
      <li>The bottle is so large, that a pump dispenser would have been good, but this is manageable, and the price is also great.</li>
      <li>Head and Shoulders has made good products for years, and this is another fine one.  </li>
      <li>So far, I am happy with it!</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent and leaves their hair nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>a pleasant, sweet</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had good success with H&amp;S, and this product seems just as effective.</li>
      <li>Tried this one and have been pleased.  </li>
      <li>It is much better as a once</li>
      <li>and it also makes your hair nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>There is so much that can be said about great shampoo for your hair and for your sens of style.</li>
      <li>I use this one about once a week to keep my scalp healthy and balanced.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m really glad to have it.</li>
      <li>I am a guy and if I am going to go through the hassle of showering, I want my hair be nice and clean and smooth!</li>
      <li>The Head and Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky works great and keeps my hair flake free and clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>It also tames my frizzy hair (fine texture, but a whole lot of it), which is great in the humidity.</li>
      <li>The smell is also really nice and fresh.  </li>
      <li>However, I have not found this shampoo to cause my hair to become more oily more quickly than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lathered sufficiently, rinsed cleanly, and smelled refreshing.</li>
      <li>Beyond that, this Head &amp; Shoulders doesn&#x27;t have any special scent, and I don&#x27;t feel that my hair is any more &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Works fine for scalp, but underwhelming conditioning.  </li>
      <li>For someone looking for a practical 2-in-1 though, this is fine.</li>
      <li>with this unseasonable heat and humidity, Head &amp; Shoulders delivers on its promise of silky smooth hair.  </li>
      <li>The review of the product Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner 23.7 Fl Oz (</li>
      <li>I bought Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky to try.  </li>
      <li>This would work great as a standalone for someone with short hair.</li>
      <li>And the cream as smooth and silky as the title.  </li>
      <li>does a great job of cleaning and conditioning my hair at the same time without leaving it looking a bit greasy looking.</li>
      <li>I enjoy most about the Head &amp; Shoulders products is clean, fresh smell.</li>
      <li>It can take a couple weeks to start working, but it significantly reduces or removes dandruff over time.</li>
      <li>After using it, my scalp feels clean.</li>
      <li>And it really seems to be effectively both together as my hair brushed so easily and smoothly today after using it.  </li>
      <li>The scent is a light and pretty one.  </li>
      <li>I have used this Smooth &amp; Silky version of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo for about a week and don&#x27;t notice much difference from the original Head &amp; Shoulders formula.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent of Head &amp; Shoulders products, always clean and soft.</li>
      <li>My hair looks clean and healthy as well as feeling soft and conditioned without those pesky frizzies</li>
      <li>My husband has been using Head &amp; Shoulders for years, and we love this new product.  </li>
      <li>It does leave my hair very smooth and soft, as promised.</li>
      <li>This new smooth and silky 2-in-1 smells great--nothing like the original scent.  </li>
      <li>So the combination is great, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it everyday.</li>
      <li>You know, those frizzies that can make me look like a wild woman on a rampage who has had one espresso too many even after a morning of meditation and</li>
      <li>The shampoo seems to clean well and rinse easily, and it leaves the hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I really wish someone would make a better product that would allow me to truly only use one type of product (in lieu of having to always use a conditioner on top of it).</li>
      <li>I have chin length fine hair, and was pleased that it did not make my hair go flat.</li>
      <li>All in all this is a very nice everyday shampoo in every respect even apart from the dandruff control, which is icing on the cake.  </li>
      <li>This particular shampoo feels very creamy, I think it&#x27;s more conditioner than shampoo.</li>
      <li>And on top of that, my scalp has not felt dry and has stayed dandruff free.</li>
      <li>If my hair was long and full, like it was in my youth, I&#x27;d love it.</li>
      <li>It was soft and easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>Works very well and does a terrific job at cleaning my hair and has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>The shampoo/conditioner comes in bottles with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While my initial response to this shampoo is favorable, I will return to edit this review and add more thoughts after using it for a month.</li>
      <li>My hairy is naturally more oily than most, so I don&#x27;t usually use conditioner shampoos that would cause my hair to be coated with anything else.</li>
      <li>My hair was so much more frizzy with my regular shampoo</li>
      <li>Besides the size is much better for family, not for personal.</li>
      <li>Note I do put this in my hair first and let it stay as I wash the rest of me, then I rinse</li>
      <li>This saves showering time and hot water.</li>
      <li>It actually works better for my son with smoother (but still curly) hair.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>than it might typically be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Head &amp; Shoulders is a good purchase for somebody suffering with a dry scalp, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll always have a bottle of it.</li>
      <li>My daughter really likes this product, plan to order more in the future.  </li>
      <li>Have pretty much always used this shampoo and Amazon happened to send me a coupon for a 2-pack...great deal.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> howdy y&#x27;all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feel kinda silly reviewing a shampoo ... [*grin*]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this does the job, smells good, doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch like some other dandruff shampoos do AND the price is not totally off the wall. i usually alternate this with j&amp;j baby shampoo. for some reason the combo does well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take care,&lt;br /&gt;lee</li>
    <li> My 15 year old son used this product and has had slight skin contact reactions with fragances in laundry detergent and a mild reation to Axe body wash but this product created an instant and severe reaction. You could see on his body where the product dripped down his chest and back. Thank goodness after a 20 minute rinse in the shower the very red bumps went away. Anyone with any skin sensitivity at all should stay far, far away from this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of using this because you remember the head and shoulders from 10+ years ago. This stuff works great, smells great and is a great value.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo.  It make my hair look, feel, and smell well.  I think the scent works equally well for men and women.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Head &amp; Shoulders for years, and we love this new product.  It smells great, takes care of your dandruff, and conditions.  It also helps with my dry scalp problem.  23.7 ounces is a lot of shampoo, and this will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. It dries out your hair and near the scalp it makes your hair look super oily. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other head and shoulders product. Smooth and Silky should not mean dry hair oily scalp. It is heavy and loads down your hair. It DOES prevent dandruff-related problems though. But I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This 2 in 1 conditioner has a light conditioner in it, that is perfect for those with fine hair.  The shampoo is creamy, and it lathers well.  You don&#x27;t feel like you are washing with a dandruff shampoo, as it is structured like a regular shampoo.  I could tell that the conditioner worked, because my hair wasn&#x27;t dry feeling, like it normally is, after I wash with shampoo.  Time will tell if it works well on flakes.  I have always used Head and Shoulders for dry scalp or flake problems, and they have never let me down.  So far, I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> Have pretty much always used this shampoo and Amazon happened to send me a coupon for a 2-pack...great deal.  Great shampoo :)</li>
    <li> I have used this Smooth &amp; Silky version of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo for about a week and don&#x27;t notice much difference from the original Head &amp; Shoulders formula.  It lathers and rinses well, has a similar scent, and helps tamp down dandruff.  It leaves my hair feeling about the same as the original formula does.  (I have used Head &amp; Shoulders off and on for years.)  My hair tends to be on the thick, straw-like side.  This does leave it feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Its embarrasing but I do have dandruff. This stuff helps greatly. Its as simple as that. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> After I had my baby I found myself with a really dry, itchy scalp.  I usually use the expensive shampoos and conditioners, so I was really skeptical to try this, but I couldn&#x27;t take the itchiness anymore, so I gave in.  I would definitely recommend using the extra conditioner only along with this 2-in-1.  But when using the two together, my hair is even softer than before!  The smell is also really nice and fresh.  AND after only a few uses, the itchiness and flaking is gone!  I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> The review of the product Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner 23.7 Fl Oz (Pack of 2) is part of our obligation to the Vine Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the name may appear to be manufactured for dandruff, the fact is we do not suffer from that condition. The shampoo is excellent and my hair went from rather dry due to excessive blow drying to smooth and silky feeling after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I enjoy most about the Head &amp; Shoulders products is clean, fresh smell. This shampoo is formulated to restore the hair from exposure to the sun, and excessive handling. It adds moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and sometimes a sensitive scalp.  I use this one about once a week to keep my scalp healthy and balanced.  It dosnt dry my hair and I like the way it smells.  This is a great price too, way cheaper than walmart or target!!</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner has a great fragrance does a great job of cleaning and conditioning my hair at the same time without leaving it looking a bit greasy looking. My hair looks clean and healthy as well as feeling soft and conditioned without those pesky frizzies I&#x27;m plagued with. You know, those frizzies that can make me look like a wild woman on a rampage who has had one espresso too many even after a morning of meditation and yoga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to only have to use one product to do double duty cleaning and conditioning as it does save time. A really great benefit when I&#x27;m in a hurry. And it also means being more likely to have enough hot water for getting cleaned up and even having a bit more hot water to just stand there and enjoy before the water gets cold when I&#x27;m not in a rush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time Head &amp; Shoulders user, and purchased this for the first time for my wife and daughter to try.  My wife used it this morning, and just sent me a note complaining that her hair looks oily and sticky, as if she hadn&#x27;t showered in a week.  She&#x27;s embarrassed enough that she doesn&#x27;t want to leave her desk or go to meetings - certainly she won&#x27;t use it again.  I only wish I&#x27;d bothered to check the reviews here - you&#x27;ll find other complaints of this product leaving an oily residue.  We&#x27;ve never had a problem with any other Head &amp; Shoulders shampoos, so I expect that there&#x27;s something unique to their &amp;#34;smooth and silky&amp;#34; formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders shampoos for  about 20 years and I like it. It is a good shampoo.</li>
    <li> A shampoo like this is hard to review. Shampoo preferences can be so subjective, and Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky is such an all purpose sort of shampoo that all I can say is: it works and I didn&#x27;t feel like I had any residue issues. I don&#x27;t think it conditions enough, but then I&#x27;m someone who always uses a seperate conditioner and thus I expect to have a stronger effect than I&#x27;d ever get from a 2-in-1. For someone looking for a practical 2-in-1 though, this is fine.</li>
    <li> This is a nice version of head &amp; shoulders but I find that it builds up if you use it every day.  It is much better as a once and a while item.  It smells good and works well.  But, if you have thin hair it will weight it down!</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be raving about a shampoo to help with dandruff, but I really have had an excellent experience. I don&#x27;t have a severe dandruff problem, but I do tend to have an oily scalp which leads to itching and occasional dandruff. This shampoo, used twice a week, has completely eliminated that. It also tames my frizzy hair (fine texture, but a whole lot of it), which is great in the humidity. I was really impressed.</li>
    <li> My husband and sons use head and shoulders almost everyday. It has a pleasant scent and leaves their hair nice and fresh. This is a great buy!</li>
    <li> The Head and Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky works great and keeps my hair flake free and clean and smooth. Can always rely on it to work.</li>
    <li> Not sure about these rave reviews.  Works fine for scalp, but underwhelming conditioning.  I still have to use conditioner. Pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Head &amp; Shoulders products, always clean and soft. I have very long, thick, curly hair so I find that 2-1 shampoo/conditioner products don&#x27;t work as well on my hair and while I do feel I still prefer doing each one - shampoo &amp; conditioner - separate this Head &amp; Shoulders is by far  one of the best 2 in 1&#x27;s I have tried.</li>
    <li> I am a guy and if I am going to go through the hassle of showering, I want my hair be nice and clean and smooth! And that is what I get with this shampoo with conditioner. The result is the same if you had used shampoo then a separate conditioner, but with the head and shoulders you just do the one! Note I do put this in my hair first and let it stay as I wash the rest of me, then I rinse and I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders is probably a household staple for anybody who suffers from a dry or itchy scalp, as I do especially during the dry winter months. One of the reasons why it&#x27;s so common is that it works, and this Smooth &amp; Silky (shampoo + conditioner) version is no exception. It can take a couple weeks to start working, but it significantly reduces or removes dandruff over time. Beyond that, this Head &amp; Shoulders doesn&#x27;t have any special scent, and I don&#x27;t feel that my hair is any more &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; than it might typically be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Head &amp; Shoulders is a good purchase for somebody suffering with a dry scalp, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll always have a bottle of it. Mainly, it&#x27;s a great value for anti-dandruff shampoo. Two of these 23.7 fl. oz. bottles would probably last one person a year - I&#x27;ve been using mine every day for over a month and only about 1/5th of the bottle is gone.</li>
    <li> I will start with the positives. I love the smell of this shampoo, reminds me oddly of the old Herbal Essence, so in that point, it&#x27;s my new favorite shampoo. It does clean my hair well, haven&#x27;t noticed any major change in the last week of using with dandruff (although maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough). However, if this is like other H&amp;S shampoos, I am sure it is working. I deducted one star, not necessarily because of this brand, but because of all of these &#x27;combination&#x27; shampoos. I still use a conditioner as none of these ever seem to do the trick on my hair on their own. I like to leave the conditioner in for a few minutes and you can&#x27;t do that with this. I really wish someone would make a better product that would allow me to truly only use one type of product (in lieu of having to always use a conditioner on top of it).</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders never disappoints. It always cleans well and leaves my hair feeling great. Even if a conditioner says 2 in 1, I still always use a separate conditioner since I have long hair. This would work great as a standalone for someone with short hair.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders has made good products for years, and this is another fine one.  It lathered sufficiently, rinsed cleanly, and smelled refreshing. The bottle is so large, that a pump dispenser would have been good, but this is manageable, and the price is also great. Being a combination of shampoo and conditioner is a bonus.</li>
    <li> After going back to my regular shampoo I had to come revise my review. My hair was so much more frizzy with my regular shampoo I couldn&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t appreciate the difference before. I&#x27;m doing back to the smooth and silky. What a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I like head and shoulders, I&#x27;ve used it for years even though I don&#x27;t have dandruff. It&#x27;s a great shampoo at a much less cost than other brand name shampoos. This particular shampoo feels very creamy, I think it&#x27;s more conditioner than shampoo. It does leave my hair very smooth and soft, as promised. I have very curly, dry hair, that I probably should condition but don&#x27;t. So the combination is great, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it everyday. I&#x27;m not use to my hair being so soft. If my hair was long and full, like it was in my youth, I&#x27;d love it. But my hair is too short and thin. It feels fuller when I use just the shampoo without the conditioner in it.&lt;br /&gt;If you do have long, thick hair, it really does condition and smooth, so I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used conditioner on my hair. I forgot how soft it makes my hair feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long-time user of Head &amp; Shoulders - among other brands of dandruff shampoo. I&#x27;ve always had good success with H&amp;S, and this product seems just as effective. My hairy is naturally more oily than most, so I don&#x27;t usually use conditioner shampoos that would cause my hair to be coated with anything else. However, I have not found this shampoo to cause my hair to become more oily more quickly than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my initial response to this shampoo is favorable, I will return to edit this review and add more thoughts after using it for a month.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I don&#x27;t have a problem with dandruff, so I can&#x27;t really speak on that part. I like the smell, the fact that I only need a small amount, it lathers well and it is priced reasonably. My hair is in it&#x27;s natural (African American) state, no chemicals. No perms, texturizers  or dyes. It did not tangle my hair and it did not leave it feeling hard. It was soft and easy to comb through. This bottle should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> A very good dandruff control with conditioner that made my hair look smooth and Silky as promised. It has a pleasant flora scent and a nice texture. I have chin length fine hair, and was pleased that it did not make my hair go flat.</li>
    <li> I am happy using this 2-In-1 Shampoo plus Conditioner. The shampoo/conditioner comes in bottles with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily. The active ingredient is the anti-dandruff Pyrithione Zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo/conditioner itself is a milky cream, which emerges readily from the container. It is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. After using it, my scalp feels clean. My hair tends to curl. However, this shampoo/conditioner seems to flatten my curls. You may or may not like that effect. It is not irritating if you get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big advantage to this product is that instead of using a separate shampoo and a separate conditioner, you can do everything on one step. This saves showering time and hot water. Altogether, I like this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used Head and Shoulders shampoo for years.  This version has built in conditioner.  It also has a pleasant scent.  The shampoo seems to clean well and rinse easily, and it leaves the hair soft and manageable.  I would say it is another win for Head and Shoulders.</li>
    <li> Good stuff to get rid of dandruff and it also makes your hair nice and smooth.  Great price here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have moderate scalp psoriasis (which is quite different from dandruff) and most dandruff shampoos don&#x27;t really help me too much.  Tried this one and have been pleased.  The aroma is pleasant and unisex appropriate, it leaves my hair manageable but without the typical unpleasant conditioner residues, and it actually helps my psoriasis a little bit which surprised me.  It doesn&#x27;t eliminate the symptoms but keeps it from getting out of control.  All in all this is a very nice everyday shampoo in every respect even apart from the dandruff control, which is icing on the cake.  Like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I have used Head and Shoulders off and on when my scalp felt dry and even though it worked well I could never get used to the medicinal smell.  This new smooth and silky 2-in-1 smells great--nothing like the original scent.  I also do not normally use a 2-in-1 shampoo, but I have been pleasantly surprised that my hair has felt pretty smooth and silky post drying.  It should be noted that it really was post blow drying and styling that my hair felt smooth and silky and maintained frizz free--not just wet out of the shower. And on top of that, my scalp has not felt dry and has stayed dandruff free.</li>
    <li> it is nice with this price and two shampoo were well protected when it arrived. Great! I still have not used it but i think it will work well. Besides the size is much better for family, not for personal.</li>
    <li> I have dry scalp and have used other brands of shampoo, but Head and Shoulders is the one I keep coming back to. Works very well and does a terrific job at cleaning my hair and has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> My husband would not use any other shampoo other than Head and Shoulders. He tried and tested this product on his coarse, curly hair. He could not tell any difference in smoothness or silkiness than the regular version. It still keeps his dandruff away and works well even with his dry skin and scalp. He washes his hair every other day or every day, and does not get dry scalp with this either.</li>
    <li> Not bad- leaves my hair clean &amp; not so dry. Great for when I&#x27;m in a rush and don&#x27;t want to use shampoo &amp; conditioner separately. I do have to use a regular shampoo &amp; conditioner weekly to get my hair really clean though b/c I think it starts getting a bit oily after about a wk.</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes this product, plan to order more in the future.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This shampoo + conditioner smells amazing and the name says it all. It saves me a lot of time in the shower since it&#x27;s an all-in-one product. It lathers up very well unlike some other dandruff shampoos. I am Korean and have long straight hair, and it really does make it smoother/silkier and shinier. No sign of flakes whatsoever. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This product should be banned from store shelves. Makes your hair feel like Barbie&#x27;s hair and dries out your hair which could lead to dry skin for many. I will NEVER recommend this!</li>
    <li> My teens and husband normally use Head &amp; Shoulders 2 in 1 Dry Scalp Control, and it works well for them.  I chose Smooth &amp; Silky to try because one teen has extremely dry, curly and frizzy hair.  These are our thoughts after trying it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a pleasant, sweet scent.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well and rinses easily.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really condition or control the frizz any better than the Dry Scalp Control.  It actually works better for my son with smoother (but still curly) hair.&lt;br /&gt;Does work to control dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in conclusion, I would like to have this in our shampoo rotation, but mainly for the change of scent.  It seems to be about the same as the Dry Scalp Control.</li>
    <li> When it comes to anti-dandruff shampoos, Head and Shoulders is definitely the best of the best.  And I really like this particular version of it because it is the shampoo and conditioner in one.  And it really seems to be effectively both together as my hair brushed so easily and smoothly today after using it.  The scent is a light and pretty one.  And the cream as smooth and silky as the title.  A little bit goes a long way with this shampoo.  And I&#x27;m really glad to have it.</li>
    <li> My husband used to use Head &amp; Shoulders for dry scalp. His scalp issues ceased to be a problem years ago,  but he still loves Head &amp; Shoulders.  I got this sample to make him happy and to try and cure my frizzy fly-aways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a thick shampoo that lathers and rinses well. I did not notice a scent, which is good that it is not overwhelming or awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with this unseasonable heat and humidity, Head &amp; Shoulders delivers on its promise of silky smooth hair.  Two days without hair that looks like a mess immediately after blow drying.  I am very happy.  My husband is in heaven to have Head &amp; Shoulders again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> There is so much that can be said about great shampoo for your hair and for your sens of style. Head &amp; Shoulders has made great shampoos and  conditioners for years, which all firmly do the exact same thing, protect your hair from any damage and prevent any harshness from dandruff that can damage your hair. They have had some great hair care products for years and haven&#x27;t shown any lack of prevention from any hair damage. This smooth and silky 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner works very nicely. It helps to prevent my hair from any damage from any dandruff that can really mess my hair up, and keeps it from losing its sheen after any damage. What I also like about this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t feel as greasy and as flawed as other hair care products that only are labeled to do right. Overall, I suggest that you give this shampoo from Head &amp; Shoulders a try, not just for the value, but because it does the job right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Husband and he loves it.  It works great and of course the scent is very clean.  The bonus is the conditioner added to the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This winter my skin has been so dry and itchy and I started noticing dandruff-like flakes.  It finally got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t take seeing all of these flakes.  I bought Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky to try.  I used it twice and will never use it again! At first I thought that I hadn&#x27;t gotten all of my conditioner washed out because my hair was super oily to the point that after I blowed dried it and tried to style it, the oily spot felt almost wet still!  The second time I used it, I used some of my regular shampoo with it and went light on the conditioner...while it wasn&#x27;t as bad, it was still too oily for me.  Awful product and will never use it again!</li>
