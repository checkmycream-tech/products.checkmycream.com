      <li>Great product better results than anticipated</li>
      <li>I LOVE the Mehron products!</li>

      <li>This powder also helps with sweating which was nice</li>
      <li>I liked this powder.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good product, easy to blend, and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Clown Antics offers the best prices &amp; customer service was easy to reach.</li>
      <li>When used with their clown white make up it works wonderfully, it doesn&#x27;t crack or run and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my Harley Quinn cosplay, and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Perfect for setting white clown makeup.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon for introducing me to another great product.</li>
      <li>I use it as a highlighter and love it.  </li>
      <li>I use it over foundation, since I&#x27;m very fair skinned, They do not sell foundation light enough for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t feel sticky and allows you to easily apply powdered eye shadows.</li>
      <li>which would easily do 5 or 6 faces.</li>
      <li>It was easy to put on, stayed on all day (and into the night)</li>
      <li>The ultra fine powder goes on super light!</li>
      <li>What a huge difference from the junk that comes in a tube.</li>
      <li>This is a great colored powder for clown white or Elizabethian period characters.</li>
      <li>Veey light and does not stick to the skin.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m irritated that I have to dig it out of the brush and soak and clean it.</li>
      <li>I bought the 1 oz jar which is a good size if you are planning to do several faces.</li>
      <li>The true test will be Disneys Halloween party in 78 degree humid weather.  </li>
      <li>Not only that, but the foundation got stuck in my powder brush, (which is a good brush)</li>
      <li>This product shipped fast and settled very nicely on the Mehron white clown makeup i bought and stayed on all day and was sweat proof.</li>
      <li>I did a photoshoot in my cosplay on a hot Sunday afternoon, and my makeup did not budge!</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it came off easily with cold cream and paper towel.</li>
      <li>Hopefully it will be suitable for what I need since I have no interest in going through the hassle of sending it back during the holidays.</li>
      <li>This product gives you a great white face look when combined with mehron clown white.</li>
      <li>This cake white is far superior.</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for a good setting powder I highly recommend  the Airspun loose face powder just in case you were wondering.</li>
      <li>As an avid Halloweener, I have looked for years for a product that goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t crackle when dry and lasts for hours, plus cleans up easily</li>
      <li>This product seals great but is hard to blend after it sets.  </li>
      <li>Of course I&#x27;m have to test the product on myself first to learn how to use it.</li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s makeup looked lovely the entire evening.</li>
      <li>They work pretty well together.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I think it would only work well on lighter skin tones since it is bright white</li>
      <li>I used this over a white face paint and it stayed in place really well, even though I was sweating, touching my face, and hugging people all day.</li>
      <li>so if you are going to be under hot lights on a stage or out in the middle of summer for LARP or Cosplay you will be fine.</li>
      <li>The tube cream melts as it is applied if it&#x27;s even a little warm in the room.</li>
      <li>Although it is white, when applied lightly it does</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>Holds in place for a long time and is generally easy to remove with makeup wipes.</li>
      <li>I love the powder, really holds up to my extreme life style.</li>
      <li>Works great but a little goes a long ways.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this .</li>
      <li>It gave me a more natural white than a clown white.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too white its just right.</li>
      <li>I live in southern LA, and the weather is hot and humid.</li>
      <li>But, even in the first application (using only a light dusting of the setting powder) I got little clumps all the place -  mainly on the cheeks.</li>
      <li>I used a fluffy makeup brush to apply the powder and it went on easily.</li>
      <li>Its smooth and I use it to highlight a little</li>
      <li>My 2 year old daughters was smudged from eating and wiping her face and rubbing her eyes</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m a professional</li>
      <li>I did my daughter&#x27;s and my face as cats at 8 am and mine still looked the same as when I did it when I was getting ready to take my shower at 10 pm.</li>
      <li>There was a slight issue with shipping, but Clown Antics was quick to resolve the issue and my shipment arrived on time.</li>
      <li>Despite the fact it shipped much sooner than expected, it&#x27;s not what I intended to order!</li>
      <li>Amazing product that helps to set your base makeup by absorbing the excess oils in the makeup.</li>

<li> But a little goes a long way</li>
<li> When using this powder (and other makeup powders that contain TALC)</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>

    <li> When used with their clown white make up it works wonderfully, it doesn&#x27;t crack or run and it lasts all day. I did my daughter&#x27;s and my face as cats at 8 am and mine still looked the same as when I did it when I was getting ready to take my shower at 10 pm. My 2 year old daughters was smudged from eating and wiping her face and rubbing her eyes but that is to be expected. We didn&#x27;t just stay home we walked to the store, went shopping and even went out to eat in it. I got a bunch of comments on our costumes and make up. People loved it and wanted to know where I got it done. This powder also helps with sweating which was nice so if you are going to be under hot lights on a stage or out in the middle of summer for LARP or Cosplay you will be fine.</li>
    <li> I got this for doing a Day of the Dead make-up on myself.  It worked great!  It was easy to put on, stayed on all day (and into the night) and I never did a touch up.  I got lots of compliments too!  The best part was when I washed it off.  My face was not red or irritated at all.</li>
    <li> Its smooth and I use it to highlight a little but, it does leave a somewhat chalky like look sometimes...im gonna try to let it sit longer and see if that helps</li>
    <li> I use it over foundation, since I&#x27;m very fair skinned, They do not sell foundation light enough for my skin tone. I use this over my foundation to lighten the tone to match my skin tone. It doesn&#x27;t get too white its just right. Stays on for a long time and prevents my face from reddening when i go outside in this heat wave.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a client&#x27;s make over that I&#x27;m doing on Valentines Day. Of course I&#x27;m have to test the product on myself first to learn how to use it. Every companies formula is a little different, so I want to be prepared for the professional make over. Just when I said on another post  - speaking of their pencils - &amp;#34;You can&#x27;t ever go wrong with this company&#x27;s products,&amp;#34; I have to eat my own words. I ordered Mehron&#x27;s clown white and setting powder.  This is a great colored powder for clown white or Elizabethian period characters. I will give Mehron that. It is ultra white, but I won&#x27;t ever buy this again for my makeup case. Although I&#x27;m a professional I don&#x27;t know everything. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something and just don&#x27;t understand how to work with some of Mehron&#x27;s powders and foundations. But, even in the first application (using only a light dusting of the setting powder) I got little clumps all the place -  mainly on the cheeks. At that point the canvas (base coat to paint on) was ruined. I was forced to start over. (Read my review of Mehron&#x27;s Clown White foundation for further information.) It was terrible. Not only that, but the foundation got stuck in my powder brush, (which is a good brush) and I&#x27;m irritated that I have to dig it out of the brush and soak and clean it. I can not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This makeup arrived literally the day after I ordered it.  I wore it over manic panic goth white and used it on some of my friends for a gothy group Halloween costume. Everyone&#x27;s makeup looked lovely the entire evening.</li>
    <li> great and easy to use</li>
    <li> I bought this along with Mehron clown white. They work pretty well together. I have pretty sensitive skin and it caused no irritation.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Harley Quinn cosplay, and I am so glad I did. I live in southern LA, and the weather is hot and humid. I did a photoshoot in my cosplay on a hot Sunday afternoon, and my makeup did not budge! Highly recommend this .</li>
    <li> I love the powder, really holds up to my extreme life style. Sweating, drinking, dancing, all night, come home, and it&#x27;s still on my face. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used this over a white face paint and it stayed in place really well, even though I was sweating, touching my face, and hugging people all day.</li>
    <li> I liked this powder. I used it in a joker costume. It gave me a more natural white than a clown white.</li>
    <li> Veey light and does not stick to the skin. Also difficult to find what to apply it with. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great but a little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> Although it is white, when applied lightly it does it&#x27;s job (mind you I have very oily skin and it still works!).</li>
    <li> Good product but READ ingredients. I purchased this product for Brow Coverage. A little info on how I use this product. I cover my dark brow with a gluestick until completely combed out and flat. Then with a foam puff I press in a good amount of this powder until covered. Allow it to SET for at least 15-20 minutes. Then I use a flesh toned liquid foundation or concealer and brush it on very thinly and gently and follow with an additional layer of flesh toned powder. Holds in place for a long time and is generally easy to remove with makeup wipes. - HOWEVER - Everyone who uses this product should be cautious. When using this powder (and other makeup powders that contain TALC) you should try not to breathe in excessively when this product is airborne. It does distribute in the air when used and you don&#x27;t want to breathe that in. So breathe in slowly through the nose and use delicate movements otherwise you&#x27;ll be breathing in a cloud of clown white.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Even helps prevent sweating and shine.&lt;br /&gt;A bit small.</li>
    <li> Great product better results than anticipated</li>
    <li> I tried this last night after i received it. What a huge difference from the junk that comes in a tube. The tube cream melts as it is applied if it&#x27;s even a little warm in the room.This cake white is far superior. However, I ordered the 16 oz. jar which is enough to do 50 faces. Next time I would buy the 2oz. which would easily do 5 or 6 faces.</li>
    <li> This product seals great but is hard to blend after it sets.  There must be a secret to it!  Thanks to Amazon for introducing me to another great product.</li>
    <li> best mime make up i have ever had. great for clown and mime or anything you would need to be made up</li>
    <li> gave me the perfectly white face for my video shoot. although the setting powder is necessary to keep from making a terrible mess and having everything painted white, it covers well, feels thick like a stage foundation and it a great product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this was white when I purchased it, but that was my fault</li>
    <li> Going to have a great face for cosplay.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Mehron products! As an avid Halloweener, I have looked for years for a product that goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t crackle when dry and lasts for hours, plus cleans up easily and these two products have my approval.  I just put my ghost bride face on to try out techniques. The base white went on smoothly and covered evenly especially using a wedge cosmetic sponge.  I used a fluffy makeup brush to apply the powder and it went on easily. It really sets the base so you don&#x27;t feel sticky and allows you to easily apply powdered eye shadows. On the lips, it allows you to use eyebrow pencils like lipstick.  Best of all, it came off easily with cold cream and paper towel. The makeup doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky on your face and it doesn&#x27;t smear.  The true test will be Disneys Halloween party in 78 degree humid weather.  But I have faith in this product.</li>
    <li> This product gives you a great white face look when combined with mehron clown white. The problem is, this stuff never dries. I was worried all night about it smearing.</li>
    <li> This is a must have item when using Mehron white clown makeup! Amazing product that helps to set your base makeup by absorbing the excess oils in the makeup. This helps the makeup last longer and prevents running from sweating, and helps so the makeup doesn&#x27;t rub off all over your clothes! The ultra fine powder goes on super light! Great product to use when doing children&#x27;s makeup so they don&#x27;t smudge their makeup or get it all over their clothes. I bought the 1 oz jar which is a good size if you are planning to do several faces. You will definitely have some left over. Clown Antics offers the best prices &amp; customer service was easy to reach. There was a slight issue with shipping, but Clown Antics was quick to resolve the issue and my shipment arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact it shipped much sooner than expected, it&#x27;s not what I intended to order! What I thought I was ordering was the Ultra White Mehron setting powder, instead it&#x27;s neutral color. Hopefully it will be suitable for what I need since I have no interest in going through the hassle of sending it back during the holidays. Because it&#x27;s not the product that&#x27;s actually listed is why I gave this a two-star rating.</li>
    <li> Perfect for setting white clown makeup. It helps it not be sticky. Would recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a setting powder but when I got it I saw that it was just white powder which actually worked out since I&#x27;m very pale and needed a new highlighting powder. A little bit goes a long way because it is very pigmented so I use it sparingly. I have to say that I think it would only work well on lighter skin tones since it is bright white but it&#x27;s a good product, easy to blend, and lasts all day. But if you are looking for a good setting powder I highly recommend  the Airspun loose face powder just in case you were wondering.</li>
    <li> I use it as a highlighter and love it.  But a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This product shipped fast and settled very nicely on the Mehron white clown makeup i bought and stayed on all day and was sweat proof. Also i would recommend to use the Mehron Barrier Spray with it too.</li>
