      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is getting rid of my wrinkles, but I have hope:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started using my dermaroller on my forehead and apply this after thinking it might work even better that way (?).</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a couple of years and still love it.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, all was okay.</li>
      <li>Maybe in time, that will get better too.</li>
      <li>It brightened up my face making it appear more balanced in tone and texture.</li>
      <li>TOO MANY SMELLS AND PARFUME.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I take off my makeup with ponds, wash my face with whatever cleanser we have on hand, and rub a dollop of this magic goop into my face.</li>
      <li>It does everything it says and more.</li>
      <li>After getting a free sample of this night cream I decided to purchase it because I loved the smell and rich texture of this cream.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin smooth and by buying it on Amazon, it is more affordable.  </li>
      <li>True, it doesn&#x27;t smell good, but I really don&#x27;t care because it works!</li>
      <li>I have spent way more and not been as happy as I am with this product.</li>
      <li>I found this does work if I use with my light lotion on my face/neck first,then addonly a penny size drop over face and neck..</li>
      <li>It is odorless, absorbs very well, and is an excellent part of facial care.</li>
      <li>I pretty much never review things on Amazon, but this product has been too good</li>
      <li>i like the rich creamy texture.</li>
      <li>I use it consistently and have noticed that my skin is firmer, more even, and brighter.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m too young to start trying to be healthy!</li>
      <li>/&gt;You have to use it regularly in order to get good results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The order arrived quickly and well boxed.</li>
      <li>The first product I have tried that does!</li>
      <li>I have had problems with dry skin and this night cream is amazing</li>
      <li>I found the serum by the same company better.</li>
      <li>and this is the first time I have tried retinol.  </li>
      <li>It feels light on my skin and so far no irritation.</li>
      <li>Wow ~~I was so excited to get this~~</li>
      <li>I have fine lines and deep wrinkles from sleeping on my side.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, a little too heavy for nighttime, but I apply it about an hour before going to sleep, in order for it</li>
      <li>Retinol day cream is much lighter.</li>
      <li>smell is very undesierable.yet</li>
      <li>This is a very creamy night cream.  </li>
      <li>So with that said happy about what it&#x27;s done to reduce my wrinkles but not happy with the smell or the lack of improvement of my pore appearance.</li>
      <li>Thick and a good weight for night cream &amp; non greasy</li>
      <li>Feels more like heavy hand cream than higher end face cream.</li>
      <li>Felt really good about this product in the beginning but regular use is causing dark circles...</li>
      <li>The funny part is that I made my very many-man husband try it for a couple nights, and now he loves it so much not only does he use it every night too, he even brings it over and rubs it into my face for me if I fall asleep without putting it on!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 51 with olive normal skin and a somewhat oily T zone.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed much with my pores and simply can not get the results that I do get using my at home PMD.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is natural and has no chemicals.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin so soft and</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have to watch what I use.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin moist and doesn&#x27;t completely soak in.  </li>
      <li>It has been used two weeks so far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Background on my skin type: good and clear growing up, some breakouts in college, pretty &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; now, but sensitive, can be dry if I don&#x27;t use moisturizer, and red and a little uneven.</li>
      <li>I am nearly 60 years old and I am told regularly that I don&#x27;t look it.</li>
      <li>I have also since bought the day cream which I haven&#x27;t used yet, as I have other products to finish first, and also another one of these.  </li>
      <li>Not sure how it is with all skin types, but if yours is like mine: pretty clear, a little uneven, a few small fine lines, a little sensitive, this is just the best thing ever, vitamin-y smell and all!</li>
      <li>I do also use other products together with this cream, but still feel that adding it has made a positive difference to the appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate so I need all the help I can get.  </li>
      <li>I suffer with crepiness and dark circles under my eyes and have large pores and fairly deep &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; between my brows.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a very heavy cream. It leaves your skin moist and doesn&#x27;t completely soak in.  I like that, but not everyone will.</li>
    <li> Great night cream.  I have spent way more and not been as happy as I am with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this night time skin cream for a couple of years.  It makes my skin smooth and by buying it on Amazon, it is more affordable.  It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.  I will continue to buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, a little too heavy for nighttime, but I apply it about an hour before going to sleep, in order for it&lt;br /&gt;to penetrate the skin and not the pillowcase.  Retinol day cream is much lighter. Hope the chemists find a way to&lt;br /&gt;lighten up the nite cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months &amp; like the way it feels on my skin. I don&#x27;t think it is getting rid of my wrinkles, but I have hope:)</li>
    <li> I just wish it would come in a larger size.  Otherwise, all was okay.</li>
    <li> Tried this out at my sister&#x27;s and loved it so I ordered some when I got back home.  Makes my skin so soft and Dr Oz&#x27;s show said we should be using Retinol every night!</li>
    <li> I found the serum by the same company better.</li>
    <li> Wife uses this also every night and says its a great product.</li>
    <li> Thick and a good weight for night cream &amp; non greasy</li>
    <li> did not care for product.  doesn&#x27;t feel or smell good.</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this less than a week.It is o.k.yet it smells horrid. I may not reorder it again .the smell is very undesierable.yet the product is seemily to be heavy as far as the cream content .I &#x27;m not fond of that either. I &#x27;ll see if it helps after a other week. claudine bgelow   footnote: I found this does work if I use with my light lotion on my face/neck first,then addonly a penny size drop over face and neck..It has been used two weeks so far.Dermatoligist  said use retinal in product. I may re order down the road.I&#x27;ll see my Derm..Dr. end of this month..Let you know afterwards.  claudine</li>
    <li> I cannot decide whether or not it is working.  I have loose skin from losing weight and thought would assist me in tightening  the skin under my neck.  I do face exercises so I can tell which is working.  The cream, exercise or both.</li>
    <li> Good seller, excellent description and good price</li>
    <li> Awesome product ESP for the price. I&#x27;ve used products that are much more expensive with less results! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and still love it.  It is consistantly good quality.  I am nearly 60 years old and I am told regularly that I don&#x27;t look it.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with dry skin and this night cream is amazing it relly helps with the dry skin still have wrinkles which I don&#x27;t care just needed the moisture on my face and this does it</li>
    <li> Excellent cream.  Went on nicely.  It does everything it says and more.</li>
    <li> Felt really good about this product in the beginning but regular use is causing dark circles...so my be I use it on alternate days....</li>
    <li> I wake up with softer skin every morning</li>
    <li> Not miraculous to say the least. It could be because I am in my 70s and it&#x27;s too late.</li>
    <li> I am over 60 and this is the first time I have tried retinol.  I know I am suppose to wait a while before judging, but I actually think it is working for me.  I have fine lines and deep wrinkles from sleeping on my side.  I actually think I see a difference only after a couple weeks of night time application.  I would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> i like the rich creamy texture. Ilt is an excellent compliment&lt;br /&gt; to my retinol oil. I am very happy with my purchace.</li>
    <li> After getting a free sample of this night cream I decided to purchase it because I loved the smell and rich texture of this cream. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a month, a do notice a definite glow to my skin.  I do also use other products together with this cream, but still feel that adding it has made a positive difference to the appearance of my skin.  I have also since bought the day cream which I haven&#x27;t used yet, as I have other products to finish first, and also another one of these.  Overall, I&#x27;m not sorry I bought this and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong in trying it out.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time now and it has been working for me.  Understand, everyone is different but I plan to keep using it because its a product that hasn&#x27;t caused my skin to break out.  I have sensitive skin and have to watch what I use.  This works for me.  I would recommend this seller, I had no problems and I got my cream almost immediately.  It&#x27;s GOOD stuff...!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51 with olive normal skin and a somewhat oily T zone. I suffer with crepiness and dark circles under my eyes and have large pores and fairly deep &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; between my brows. Started using this at night only about 4 weeks ago after an impulse buy at my local Sally&#x27;s beauty store. It&#x27;s thick and really smelly. Like gross over perfumed smelly. Hate to over dramatize here but I really hate the smell alot. That&#x27;s about the only downside to this cream for me. It brightened up my face making it appear more balanced in tone and texture. Best part is that it&#x27;s really helped ALOT with the lines between my brows! I&#x27;ve started using my dermaroller on my forehead and apply this after thinking it might work even better that way (?). I haven&#x27;t really noticed much with my pores and simply can not get the results that I do get using my at home PMD. So with that said happy about what it&#x27;s done to reduce my wrinkles but not happy with the smell or the lack of improvement of my pore appearance. Maybe in time, that will get better too. I&#x27;ve still got quite a bit of product left and it&#x27;s not caused any breakouts on me. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin really soft.</li>
    <li> Great cream ! Non greasy, just what I need. After using the cream, your skin is refreshed.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT CARE FOR THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. TOO MANY SMELLS AND PARFUME. WHY DON&#x27;T YOU TRY PUTTING THE BEST INGREDIENT  INTO YOUR PRODUCT THAT WILL WORK INSTEAD OF ALL THESE UNNESSCARY  THINGS THAT DON;&#x27;T WORK OR HAVE NO PURPOSE.</li>
    <li> I like that it has SPF and by the way I an 26 I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m too young to start trying to be healthy!</li>
    <li> Feels more like heavy hand cream than higher end face cream. I had read some reviewers didn&#x27;t care for the perfume and I have to agree.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this both at night and under my makeup and in conjunction with a firming cream. It is odorless, absorbs very well, and is an excellent part of facial care. Be careful not to use near the eyes. The order arrived quickly and well boxed.</li>
    <li> Retinol is by far the best night cream I have used to date.  I use product daily and again this is #1!  Love it</li>
    <li> Excellent to get Rid of wrinkles or to prevent.&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it regularly in order to get good results.&lt;br /&gt;It is natural and has no chemicals.</li>
    <li> I pretty much never review things on Amazon, but this product has been too good not to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background on my skin type: good and clear growing up, some breakouts in college, pretty &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; now, but sensitive, can be dry if I don&#x27;t use moisturizer, and red and a little uneven. I also have some faint dark circles under my eyes. Now that I am in my mid 20s, I am starting to get conscious of little lines creeping up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that background in mind, I can say that I have tried dozens and dozens of different lotion, creams, treatments, both cheap and expensive and there are only two things that I will buy for the rest of my life: ponds cold cream, to take off my makeup at night, and this! (The night cream). I take off my makeup with ponds, wash my face with whatever cleanser we have on hand, and rub a dollop of this magic goop into my face. True, it doesn&#x27;t smell good, but I really don&#x27;t care because it works! I use it consistently and have noticed that my skin is firmer, more even, and brighter. I don&#x27;t even wear foundation anymore -- just concealer. The funny part is that I made my very many-man husband try it for a couple nights, and now he loves it so much not only does he use it every night too, he even brings it over and rubs it into my face for me if I fall asleep without putting it on! hah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is simple, inexpensive, and actually does what it is supposed to. The first product I have tried that does! Not sure how it is with all skin types, but if yours is like mine: pretty clear, a little uneven, a few small fine lines, a little sensitive, this is just the best thing ever, vitamin-y smell and all!</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate so I need all the help I can get.  This is a very creamy night cream.  My skin seems softer after a short period of time. I would recommend it as a great night cream.</li>
    <li> Wow ~~I was so excited to get this~~ Used it for weeks~~It made my skin so dry I had to resort to putting Oil&lt;br /&gt;on~~Way to drying~ I have used Retinol products before but none were drying as this</li>
    <li> Was delivered to my door immediately within days of ordering. It feels wonderful to use. And I believe it will definitely work. It feels light on my skin and so far no irritation.</li>
</ol>
