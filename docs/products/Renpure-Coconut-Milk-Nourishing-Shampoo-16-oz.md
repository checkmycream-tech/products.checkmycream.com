      <li>I&#x27;ll never buy another brand &amp; I highly recommend these products :D</li>
      <li>(simply because I was so impressed by the co-wash)</li>
      <li>I also dont love it)</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>no oil just sitting on top of the hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>no oil just sitting on top of the hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Amazing scent and makes my hair so smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>I also dont love it)</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this project the verdict is still out</li>
      <li>It lathers beautifully and left my hair feeling soft and wonderful.  </li>
      <li>but it does clean the hair nicely.</li>
      <li>But after a little research I heard about co-wash as a great way to condition hair and after all other great hair online hair suggestions I decided that the best kind for my hair &amp;#34;may</li>
      <li>It is better than the most expensive hair products I have used and incredibly affordable and color-safe, the best quality!</li>
      <li>Works good, smells wonderful, and the price was right compared to other brands.</li>
      <li>I bought it on the spur because I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Product labeled as organic and free of harmful ingredients.</li>
      <li>but different, lol) I hastily settled on the Renpure Coconut Co-wash and after the very FIRST USE...</li>
      <li>and when I tell you that my hair has NEVER FELT SO CLEAN...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very low lather which is good for your hair</li>
      <li>This shampoo, on the other hand, is the BEST natural shampoo I have ever discovered!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s good for the price better than anything you find in the drugstore however still not sure if it&#x27;s comparable to salon quality</li>
      <li>Since using Renpure my hair looks really healthy and is very soft.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and it makes my hair so soft and managable.  </li>
      <li>Really great for natural coarse (4c) hair.</li>
      <li>there was a TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT!!!&lt;br /&gt;One day I&#x27;d purchased one of those magic barber sponges with the hope that it could help give me tighter curls that would actually last; with this product you need to use a moisturizer on the sponge</li>
      <li>I Immediately noticed how soft, tangle free, shiny and weightless my hair was, literally after the FIRST wash.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I tried many different shampoos and conditioners from Renpure line.  </li>
      <li>sometimes I do a second one to get more of a vigorous latger.</li>
      <li>I am trying to treat my hair better and grow it long</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hard to find a good shampoo/comditioner without parabens &amp; sulfate without drying my hair out.</li>
      <li>Shampoo does not have much of a coconut smell to it</li>
      <li>I have to use a TON of this stuff to even get a decent lather.</li>
      <li>Theoretically, I prefer sulfate-free, natural hair products, but find that most often, the quality of the products seem to suffer, making hair more tangled, more dull, and less shiny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll never buy another brand &amp; I highly recommend these products :</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The product contains a very unnatural smelling fragrance, so if you are looking for natural, organic ingredients, keep looking.  </li>

      <li>And it&#x27;s the HAIR that is soft, there is abbbbbbbsoLUTELY</li>
      <li>All the Renpure products I have tried so far, have hit it out of the park.  </li>
      <li>I have a very very tricky 3C/4A blend that is very very soft (won&#x27;t hold curls) but also, has NEVER actually &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34; a product in my entire 36yr life!</li>
      <li>So one day at my local hair store (while getting SOoooOoo overwhelmed with all the different products that all claim to do pretty much the same things...</li>
      <li>All of them left our scalps dried out and very itchy after the first couple of times we started using these products.</li>
      <li>It did not leave my hair dry or matted after washing -- this is the first time a shampoo has not left my hair dry and matted.</li>

    <li> This is a great product! I have dry hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a good shampoo/comditioner without parabens &amp; sulfate without drying my hair out. It smells great also!</li>
    <li> Really great for natural coarse (4c) hair. It did not leave my hair dry or matted after washing -- this is the first time a shampoo has not left my hair dry and matted. I love it! 😊</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Smells good and took the place of my grocery store shampoo and conditioner. Very satisfied customer. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair feels good!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this project the verdict is still out I&#x27;m deciding if it&#x27;s drying my hair out. It&#x27;s very low lather which is good for your hair sometimes I do a second one to get more of a vigorous latger. I think it&#x27;s good for the price better than anything you find in the drugstore however still not sure if it&#x27;s comparable to salon quality</li>
    <li> My daughter and I tried many different shampoos and conditioners from Renpure line.  All of them left our scalps dried out and very itchy after the first couple of times we started using these products. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good quality product.  Works good, smells wonderful, and the price was right compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shampoo.  I bought it on the spur because I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo.  I thought it would not lather.  It lathers beautifully and left my hair feeling soft and wonderful.  I have African-American locs, which are color treated and prone to dryness.  So I have to be careful.  This worked so much better than I expected--and as others have mentioned--it smells really great too.  I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Just want to say Very Nice stuff!!</li>
    <li> Works great and does wonders for my hair. All I could ask for.</li>
    <li> Not for coarse hair. I have very coarse, dry over processed hair due to coloring. I only shampoo about once a week. I have to use a TON of this stuff to even get a decent lather. Smells okay. I wont purchase again though.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it makes my hair so soft and managable.  Love the price too!  Goodbye WEN @$35. for 16 oz.  All the Renpure products I have tried so far, have hit it out of the park.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Allergic reaction/How do I return?</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It is very gentle on my hair and smells wonderful! And no sulfates is what sold me on this product!  Also no Sodium chloride, dyes, parabens or Gluten.  I am trying to treat my hair better and grow it long and I think this is a great start to my journey.</li>
    <li> Shampoo does not have much of a coconut smell to it but it does clean the hair nicely. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> EZ Lather...I like this....ALOT !..+ It&#x27;s COCONUT people...lol</li>
    <li> Best product line i ever used. Gives my dry limp hair moisture and body. It helps it grow and repaired the damage done by Pantene. My hair used to fall out in clumps.. no more!</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every brand of shampoo at the store. I dye my hair once a month and my hair was starting to dry out. I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. This shampoo/cleanser actually works really well for my thin Hair! Since using Renpure my hair looks really healthy and is very soft. My hair isn&#x27;t breaking off like it was and I&#x27;m getting length back. I highly recommend this product. The smell is also really great! Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I have a very very tricky 3C/4A blend that is very very soft (won&#x27;t hold curls) but also, has NEVER actually &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34; a product in my entire 36yr life! meaning products are usually just sitting on the outer layer of my hair and not doing a damn thing.

But after a little research I heard about co-wash as a great way to condition hair and after all other great hair online hair suggestions I decided that the best kind for my hair &amp;#34;may be&amp;#34; a milk based shampoo formula. So one day at my local hair store (while getting SOoooOoo overwhelmed with all the different products that all claim to do pretty much the same things...but different, lol) I hastily settled on the Renpure Coconut Co-wash and after the very FIRST USE...there was a TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT!!!&lt;br /&gt;One day I&#x27;d purchased one of those magic barber sponges with the hope that it could help give me tighter curls that would actually last; with this product you need to use a moisturizer on the sponge and I decided to go with a Motions brand product that, UGH!! Was SO disgusting and just made my hair super oily and sticky on the outside, I had thankfully bout this Renpure Coconut Milk Shampoo (simply because I was so impressed by the co-wash) and when I tell you that my hair has NEVER FELT SO CLEAN...Hun-tee!!! I can&#x27;t even describe in words how well such a little amount of this product lathered up and cleaned my hair. I swear that as I ran my hands down the strands, my hair and scalp began to sinnnnnggg to the Heavens like little baby angels!!!! I followed with the co-wash AND... I had also purchased the Renpure Argan Oil Deep condition (I mix a few drops inside a spray bottle with water and while my hair is in bantu knots which I usually leave in for a few days, I periodically spray the mixture on the knots and line my scalp with Jamaican Black Castor Oil)... I took a knot down fora girl yyesterday to explain how hard it is for me to hold curls... that girl touched my hair and was in aww!!! She was like OMG!!! Its sooooo silky and soft! And it&#x27;s the HAIR that is soft, there is abbbbbbbsoLUTELY no oil just sitting on top of the hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;I Love this stuff!!! I have never really been the type that would be all devoted to an entire Line of hair care products; I mix and match like a dollar menu... but not anymore!! I&#x27;m preparing to get the Renpure curling lotion (I currently use Shea Moisture and I don&#x27;t hate it but... I also dont love it) Renpure has me sold! My scalp used to hurt sooo bad from all the tension of doing stupid stuff with my hair but now, it feels like those freaky shower girls in the Garnier Fructise commercials! I&#x27;ll never buy another brand &amp; I highly recommend these products :Dwater and while my hair is in bantu knots which I usually leave in for a few days, I periodically spray the mixture on the knots and line my scalp with Jamaican Black Castor Oil)...

    <li> This shampoo is AMAZING. Theoretically, I prefer sulfate-free, natural hair products, but find that most often, the quality of the products seem to suffer, making hair more tangled, more dull, and less shiny. This shampoo, on the other hand, is the BEST natural shampoo I have ever discovered! It is better than the most expensive hair products I have used and incredibly affordable and color-safe, the best quality! I Immediately noticed how soft, tangle free, shiny and weightless my hair was, literally after the FIRST wash.</li>
    <li> Perfume alert! Product labeled as organic and free of harmful ingredients. The product contains a very unnatural smelling fragrance, so if you are looking for natural, organic ingredients, keep looking.  I decided not to return it bcuz I liked the packaging and the pump feature.  I dumped out the perfumie stuff and put in my Desert Essence Coconut Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent and makes my hair so smooth and silky.</li>
