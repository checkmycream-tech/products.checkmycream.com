<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like using this, it does help with wrinkles and smells good.  If I use it too often my face feels a little greasy.  I have a combination complexion.  I am over seventy and have a beautiful complexion.</li>
    <li> Product is very good, and my skin loves it. I will purchase  more of it for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost a year, in conjunction with the Premier facial biox serum.  The cream is rich but not oily, and a little goes a long way.  In fact, I&#x27;m just ordering my second jar now, and like I said, I&#x27;ve already been using it for almost a year.  It leaves my skin very smooth and soft, and I&#x27;m hoping it will prevent any future wrinkles from forming.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with Anti age serum and eye treatment.  Within a week my skin became irritated and felt like it was burning.  My eyes looked like the had glue on the outer edges after waking up in the morning and when I tried to wash them clean, it was gritty and very hard to come clean.  Had a salty, gritty feel to it and hurt to wash it out of my eye area.  I discontinued use and spent $142.00 on three Premier products that went into the trash within a week.  I won&#x27;t be spending on anymore expensive products for anti-aging.  Just grow old gracefully!  LOL</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and was as ordered.  It was much less expensive than in the stores and other sites.</li>
    <li> At almost 50, I&#x27;ve tried several serums and mousturizers. Premier Dead Sea products are wonderful and I will continue to use them!</li>
    <li> I received a promotion at work, and with that some additional job stress. In 2 weeks I look like I had aged 2 years. This cream reversed everything. My skin has never looked so dewey! I won&#x27;t use anything else! So glad I found this! I also use the Perfecting Cream and Peel. I only use the peel once a week. I purchased both at the mall.</li>
    <li> All of this is great because it keeps the lines off and keeps my rosacea in check</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the noir mask for many years now and it just makes your facial skin glow. I usually apply this product when I am going to a party, wedding and reunions. My skin looks radiant and I feel all may makeup looks even better. It makes me look even younger and confident.  Best product ever!</li>
    <li> I really think I got more than expected.  It is a good product not grease. My face is really mosturize I only have 3 weeks using it and i feel the different. More younger looking skin. is  one of the best products in the market anyone can trust and purchase.</li>
    <li> was excellent noticed difference in two days</li>
    <li> Very good skin feels smooth. Only ten minutes.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s fragrance free and moisturizes well , has  a firming effect,great for antiaging skin..i would recommend it for anybody over 40 years old.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and can feel a difference on my skin.  I have been asked what I have been doing different for my face. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> OK. Very fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years now, and I really love how it makes my skin feel soft, smooth and actually more youthful. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> BEWARE - picture does not match product description....I did not catch this until I received the incorrect product and went back to check my order history.  Did not get what I wanted...very misleading post.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be 66 but look 45 or so I&#x27;ve been told.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful cream. I&#x27;m using Premier products for 20 years already. They always come with some new wonderful creams</li>
    <li> Thank you. Item is open but quality is good</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it really works well for me.  Good price and quick turn around service  Would recommend this site to anyone.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Premier line of Anti-Age products for the last 2 years.  I will be 50 yr old in a few months and since the age of 36 I&#x27;ve been afraid of wrinkle so I&#x27;ve used Avon, store bought lines, to expensive department store lines.  They did ok I suppose, I wasn&#x27;t showing much age on my face when I started to begin with.  My test was what I call my mad lines between the eyes, they were deeply set in and nothing got rid of them.  A couple years ago I spent too much money at the kiosk in the mall and bought some Premiere products. Nothing I&#x27;ve bought before that did much for the &amp;#34;Mad Lines&amp;#34;, and I was noticing my forehead having more lines then usual. I freaked out!  I noticed a huge difference in about a month; mind you I was 47 at that time.  Now my &amp;#34;Mad Lines&amp;#34; are GONE! My forehead is smooth and I still look mid to late 30s.  I will never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I did notice some people start using creams and serums AFTER the signs of aging have set in and expect to look 10 years younger after a few months.  The trick is to start at the first sign or even better before to stave off the wrinkles.  A friend I work with said I&#x27;m not going to worry until I have too.  Every one thinks she is older than me and was shocked to hear I&#x27;m older then she is.  My point is don&#x27;t expect a miracle and you will be happy with ANY result you WILL get; just give it time to work.</li>
    <li> I started using the Dead Sea products almost a year ago when I bought them at a kiosk in NYC--very expensive.  I have since been able to find them on Amazon--much less expensive.  I have dry skin and they are great at reducing the fine lines an evening out the blotchy skin.  It&#x27;s much easier to apply make up over these products as well. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any skin cream that hydrates like the dead sea products.</li>
    <li> I chose this Premier brand because my sister inlaw told me about it, and I have been using it off and on. I had stopped using the product and ordered it again and my son told me how nice my skin looked without knowing that I  was using premier products, with that I will continue using it. The cream goes on and gives the skin a nice soft glow, I put it on my face morning and night.</li>
    <li> Not a &amp;#34;miracle in a jar&amp;#34;, but then nothing is.  Love the way it makes my skin look and feel though.  Have not used it long enough to judge it&#x27;s ongoing effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have used the product before, so I am familiar with it</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and never had a problem with it.  I would not think that if I ordered through Amazon that you would be dealing with a distributor who tampered with the product.  It was repackaged and very poorly so.  You should be assumed of yourselves!!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time.  The outer packaging was good, however, inner package appeared to have been opened previously.  The product is very creamy and feels good on the skin.  Some creams will cause irritation on my skin if there is too much oil.  This did not and just made my skin feel soft.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you!  I love the cream and your products!  Premier dead sea does very good results for me and your cost are very reasonnable!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before.  What was in the jar this time was quite different!  It was very heavy and thick.  Not light and airy!!!  Someone put a different product in this jar!!!</li>
    <li> I like this better than Perricone&#x27;s cold plasma.  Have this as a staple in your skin care regimen. You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I really like the product, but not the cost.  It&#x27;s expensive and doesn&#x27;t last as long as L&#x27;Oreal similar product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years. It is terrific.</li>
    <li> Unless I find something better (which I have not), I will order this product. Amazon sells it cheaper than any place I have found it recently. My problem is that the more I like it and say I like it, the higher the price seems be going. I have used other products over the years, but none that gave me the results this one does. I have been using it for 5 years now. (I am 58). I would recommend it to anyone of any age who wants to have softer skin with less noticeable wrinkles. Please do not stop carrying this product. I also use the milk cleanser and the facial serum. I use the eye serum and eye cream as well.</li>
    <li> Premier Dead Sea Biox&lt;br /&gt;  This is a wonderful cream,I have been using this for 2 days&lt;br /&gt;  and it makes your skin feel great.Wonderful under your make up.Sofi</li>
    <li> ive used so many other products out there and this biox cream is slowly reducing wrinkles in my face. one of my customers noticed the difference in my skin in 1 week. very impressed</li>
    <li> Wonderful product; by far the best eye cream my wife has ever tried!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought I was getting.  Evidently the product I had before is no longer available.  I never got an explanation.  This is comparable to any decent less expensive moisturizer cream.</li>
    <li> Een super product! Het houd je huid jong. Ik gebruik het al jaren, en ben zeer tevreden. Je doet lang met een pot.</li>
    <li> For at least 20 years I&#x27;ve used Lancome there whole line of abosolute Gold Top ,Genifique,and genifique eye, they were pricey but was scared to stop, til one day at the mall the kiosk guy got me to listen, very hesitant as I told him what I use, showed him... he said no good...let me do 1 side of face so i did... WOW I was blown away...(have puffiness under eyes, some uneven skin tone little white bumps), once he told me the price i was forget it....til he came down to 600$ for the eye serum, eyecream, biox intensive age treatment and premiere cleanser, (i had gone to mall for my Lancome absolute night gold bottle, i did get it)he told me to bring it back, won&#x27;t need it, (i couldn&#x27;t all the ladies at Lancome know me, and when a special was on they always called&amp;reserved extra for me)thought about driving to another mall... ended up giving it to mom as she uses lancome...didn&#x27;t tell her about Biox...that was my secret....I haven&#x27;t been back to lancome since, when they call me i told them oh i just bought it online..lol..I know off the subject.. I came home from mall feeling guilty for spending almost 800$ on products (had lancome night serum too)my husband said what did you do to your face looks good ... he doesn&#x27;t even notice when i go for a color and added highlights...so i told him what happened , and i bought just a few products lol..next morning I googled  dead sea products ..saw the web site just said enjoy this while it last.. can&#x27;t afford all of these products..then i saw AMAZON...what I had just paid 600$ i could have gotten for the most $120.  so I packed up everything went back to mall told guy keep it want money back i can get these on Amazon,for a quarter of the price if not less, long story short he threw in the whole line, told me what was on Amazon was a fake..That was 2 years ago My skin loves this, I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments, family members, asking me what I did I look so good to...coworkers, said i had to have some kind of procedure done(was out of work due to a car accident for a month) ...even got carded..I love it...now i use there whole line i do the treatment or masks as needed, when i feel i need a pick me up these products aren&#x27;t fake....I, my husband and family notice a big difference, now my husband has me do facials on him..he&#x27;s a truck driver for local construction co, the guys said...(what happened last night)lol...the price so much cheaper than Lancome....look better...best thing i&#x27;ve done for myself, my age....well put it this way over 45 wish I was still 45ish ....  don&#x27;t hesitate, to buy, It really DID work for me..Thank You AMAZON!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law introduced me to this product and gave me my first jar.  It is amazing and I love the way it leaves my skin.  I can see myself using this for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I am 57 and until the last year or so I had good skin.  Once the crows feet and fine wrinkles appeared, I started trying different products without success.  Most recently I ventured into the ones with retinol which was a big mistake - made my skin dry and seemed to enhance, not fix, problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started Premier when I was accosted by one of the kiosk salesman and bought only the eye serum (which I paid $80 for!).  When I went home I searched on amazon and found it for less than 1/2 of what I paid, in addition to the rest of the BIOX line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the BIOX line now for about 1 week and noticed such a change.  The crows feet are almost gone, my forehead looks dramatically different and those fine wrinkles are hard to find.  And my skin feels WONDERFULLY SOFT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the progress continues!  For me, this is the best stuff around!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and really like it.  It works much better when combined with the anti aging Biox serum.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I LOVE PREMIER DEAD SEA! I have always loved dead sea products, but I have found nothing that compares to Premier. I have extremely sensitive dry skin, flaky, itchy at times, you can see every pore wrinkle &amp; flake. I also have eczema which can be a pain.... My goal was to find something for anti aging and that my skin could handle. Prescription lotions wouldnt even work for me, ive even tried botox, restyl- etc. for anti aging. Experimenting btw. I was stopped at a Kiosk years back and bought eye serum... Amazing. Became so expensive after purchasing over and over diff products.... I realized im not getting younger either. Premier Sea BIOX is wonderful!! I apply it at night after washing and exfoliating my face, by morning my skin is really soft, youthful.... Puffy eyes gone, no rashy cheeks, as if collagen reproduced in my face 10x faster over night. I wont say this is plastic surgery in a jar, BUT you will feel and see  the difference. Compliments!! 48-72hours I was stoked in the mirror. My age may be frowned upon for using this but it works! Pores shrank, and flakyness is gone.... Im insecure about my laugh lines and those have even improved! Smooth appearance! 2stars for price &amp; 5stars for Premier Dead Sea Products!!&lt;br /&gt;(My age:29/ dry skin/ dry brittle hair/ sensitive to most products/ poor diet&amp; hate drinking water)</li>
    <li> I bought this product after trying it at the mall.  I liked it but I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay what they wanted for it.  I always check with Amazon and they always have the best prices.</li>
    <li> I have very fair ad sensitive skin that most anti-aging cream burn.  this one is very soothing and seems to be helping the wrinkles to o away.</li>
    <li> The container was not sealed. I&#x27;m a little leery about using the product.</li>
    <li> Finally received my cream. Love this product &amp; at a much cheaper price then at that mall. I can feel the difference in my skin with 1st application.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisterizer for daily use.  It is a little thin, but sinks in well and lasts.  The scent is nicely understated.  Would buy this product again.  The shipping from the seller took just over a week.</li>
    <li> I like the product and it felt great putting it on,  but saw no difference in the appearance on my face whatsoever.  So, great as a facial cream that is it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 years.  It is the best product I have ever used on my skin.  I am 67 years old and my skin has never been so smooth.  I use the anti-aging biox serum and cream together.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the cream.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a rich moisturizing cream. I am 52 and have very few wrinkles but after only using it for 2 weeks I notice that the small wrinkles I have are harder to see. Great seller, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great product love the whole line from premier.  I have been using for about 8 months and my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of cream, I got taken for$400 at one of those kiosks in the mall, I kinda knew I was getting ripped off by I had no idea how badly!! He tried it on me and it really worked so I naturally I wanted it anyway on the ride home from the mall I googled it and saw Amazon has it for a fraction on the price. I was so upset that they ripped me off so badly but glad I discovered it. It&#x27;s a great price on Amazon and trust me it works. I got tons of compliments and plan to order from Amazon next time. My sister loves it too, the vivo per lei peeling cream works great too. Order that with the mask and you will be very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months and love it.  But I don&#x27;t love the high price I paid at the mall kiosk.  Found it on Amazon for a great price. Until I received it, I was still skeptical that it would be the exact same product I had been using.  I am happy to say that it is.  Now I will order some of the other items as Christmas gifts for my friends and family.</li>
    <li> While I believe this is an excellent product, I rate it a hreee because it is no better than any other cream that sells for similar value.  I would recommend it, but you can get just as good of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; over the counter for similar price without the shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, saved me lots of money on Restylane! Is good for special events and also for daily use.</li>
    <li> It makes me and my skin so pleasant with its good smell. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love the whole line of biox products and would never be without them.  They are my goto basics.  They never irritate my typically super sensitive skin and they make my skin so soft and lines practically disapear!  Great seller and quick shipping is an added bonus for sure!</li>
    <li> love the product it works , i&#x27;ve use it for three weeks and i can see my skin lift it already , and my face and neck smoother and so soft THANKS . Glad i got it .</li>
    <li> I love this product !!! It&#x27;s quickly absord by skin, nourrishing deep inside and&lt;br /&gt;my skin is now more clear, fresh and look better. Overly price but good for me.</li>
    <li> I love all the dead sea products by premiere. This one I use morning n nite around my eyes n mouth. It makes my skin feel silky n smooth. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about how I look younger.</li>
    <li> I first tried the eye cream, and decided to give the face cream a try. I like them both! The face cream is not greasy, has a very light pleasant smell. It keeps my face moisturized and hydrated. I think the pores on my face have gotten even smaller. It&#x27;s as good as (if not better than) other brand name creams I use (Lancome and Shiseido). Because of the decent price, I might just switch over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it as long as the price doesn&#x27;t go up too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;06/01/2014 - I don&#x27;t know what happened, the price used to be around $30. It shot up to $80 in the last few months. Now it&#x27;s down to $50. I&#x27;ll start buying it if it goes down to $30 something, otherwise might as well buy the department brands.</li>
    <li> great night time facial cream... non greasy and absorbs rapidly</li>
    <li> Primier makes great skin products. Can tell a difference after only a couple of weeks. My pores are smaller and my small lines are minimized</li>
    <li> I have used these products for over a year now and I love the results. I look younger, even my kids could tell the difference! Used together with the full eye care set, you get great results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom a few years ago. She actually uses Lancome anti-aging creams and had been for years. Every few months, she&#x27;d reserve herself $100-$200 for a jar of her cream. A few years ago, I was dating one of those Israeli salesmen at the kiosks. I bought this for my mom for $80, at the time. (I know that it&#x27;s more expensive at the kiosks, that&#x27;s because they have to sell it for a certain amount and can&#x27;t go any cheaper than that. They work on commission too so they try to sell for more) It was cheaper than buying her Lancome cream and the \\&quot;boss lady\\&quot; used them and looked great, so I thought it was a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used the cream and loved it. She wanted more, but I had moved and broken up with the guy. The website had ridiculous prices for this stuff, more than double what I paid. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else online or even the malls. We pretty much forgot about this and she went back to her old creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day, she was asking me about stocking up on her creams and I told her that she should find something other than Lancome. I told her that it&#x27;s just too expensive and I&#x27;m sure we could find something just as good if not better for a cheaper price. I was mostly upset by this because I had bought her a giant jar of her cream and she used it just as fast as the regular sized jar, so I wasn&#x27;t going to just dish it out like that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She started talking about different brands that she had heard about, but said, \\&quot;You know what? Nothing was as good as those Israeli creams you got me that one time. Everyone told me I looked so good. My face had a huge transformation after using those things for just a month. See if you can find those again.\\&quot; I did a quick search and found the products for a fraction of the price! I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has these at such great prices! We bought 6 products for the price of one of the Lancome creams and I&#x27;m sure she won&#x27;t be going through it as quickly either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see my mother often, so I&#x27;ve never seen for myself how they work, but I know she loves all the Premiere and Dead Sea products. I&#x27;ve even gone ahead and ordered myself some of their skin products.</li>
    <li> Great product, it leaves your skin very smooth and looking healthy.</li>
    <li> fast service and good product. I would recommend this as an anti-aging cream. My skin seem to look and feel better, especially the dry, trouble area around my nose.</li>
    <li> I began with the Premier serum I bought in Israel then found this online.  Don&#x27;t know how many containers I have purchased and while it won&#x27;t turn back the clock it seems to help some.</li>
    <li> This anti-age complex cream and serum are my absolute favorite from Premier Dead Sea product lines.  I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  I have side by side the ones I purchased from the mall and the ones I purchased from Amazon.  They are identical.  One difference is the ones from Amazon at 70-90% discount from the mall.  What not to love about the products.  Ladies with mature skin, try them.  Cream works well with serum.  Your skin will thank you.</li>
