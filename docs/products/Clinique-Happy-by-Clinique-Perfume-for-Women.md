      <li>This is not a knock off, definitely the real deal.</li>
      <li>This order came from PerfumeWorldWide and was completely satisfactory.</li>
      <li>It is a very faint smell of happy cologne</li>

      <li>It drives me crazy good.</li>
      <li>This was less exspensive that higher end stores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great price. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I bought this for my wife and I just love it.  She likes it too even though I don&#x27;t think she cares as much as I do.  This perfume is for sure in my top 5.</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
    <li> My husband loves when I wear this perfume. It&#x27;s light and very citrusy. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 15 years, so this is a repeat purchase. For comparison, I also wear Donna Karan&#x27;s Pure, Cashmere Mist and Fragonard&#x27;s L&#x27;Orangerie. The first two are very musky (perfect for winter) and Fragonard&#x27;s is another citrusy scent, heavier on orange. Clinique&#x27;s Happy is more lemony-grapefruit.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this product but she can only find the 1.7 ounce bottle in the shops. This price of the 3.4 ounce bottle on Amazon.com is fantastic! So I bought it.....a no-brainer for me....</li>
    <li> Great product,price and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> My very favorite scent. Have used for many years.</li>
    <li> I got the perfume about 2 days earlier than expected.  What a nice surprise! Otherwise, all is good!</li>
    <li> It smells good and not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;This is the second purchase of this perfume for my wife. Perfume is a tough item to buy. I must say that my wife loves it and I am not complaining. I give it a 5:&lt;br /&gt;1) The smell is nice&lt;br /&gt;2) It is not overwhelming</li>
    <li> honestly i was hesitated to order perfume online due to negative reviews on here. But then i thought, people are ugly in heart sometime and they will never be happy no matter what. and again i have honestly never smell this before but my mom love it. so i gave it a try and order this from these guy, wen i gave it to her, she said yep! thats the smell i love. i thought wow! I&#x27;m going to have to purchased from them again. may be buying perfume online isn&#x27;t so hard after all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years it goes great with my body chemistry..I love the low price on Amazon as well..</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with anything Clinique i.ve used their products for over 40 yrs..from lipstick,mascara and more , the best products... but just a little pricy!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Clean fresh scent, isn&#x27;t over powering. I get more compliments when I wear this scent than any other I own.</li>
    <li> My experience made me &#x27;Happy&#x27; since I was almost out of my favorite perfume and once ordered it came to my door within 36 hours! I was impressed. Debbie</li>
    <li> Its wonderful smell. I can not keep my hands off my wife when she puts this on. It drives me crazy good. I do recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I saw all the reviews about the product not smelling normal and it must not be real to be so much cheaper than the department stores.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;You are getting a GREAT product for an incredible price :) I&#x27;m am so happy with my buy... finally I could afford my favorite perfume :)</li>
    <li> Does not smell or stay like the ones I have purchased in store locally.  The scent is very weak.  It is a very faint smell of happy cologne</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;My son wanted to purchase this for his wife as a gift,&lt;br /&gt;so I went to Amazon and found it for him.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews but I love this scent soooo much I just had to take the chances. I ordered it and it got to my house in 5 days. The scent is amazing just like the original. This is not a knock off, definitely the real deal. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Llegó en excelente estado, estoy muy conforme con el producto, agradezco el servicio,  muchas gracias por todo el servicio, es excelente.</li>
    <li> Great Value and Great Fragrance!</li>
    <li> I love smelling this perfume on my wife it smells good .</li>
    <li> i cannot comment on the perfume personally, but my sister loves it.&lt;br /&gt;it arrived on time and everyone was &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; xmas morning</li>
    <li> Excellent product delivered promptly</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when wearing Clinique Happy that I&#x27;ve stopped wearing anything else. It&#x27;s fresh and light and slightly flowery. This order came from PerfumeWorldWide and was completely satisfactory. Beware of sellers who may be unloading old stock that has lost its original fragrance.</li>
    <li> Definitely not the same as what you buy in the department store. The scent smells a little off (maybe old) and it doesn&#x27;t hold up well at all. Within an hour my wrist smells like alcohol instead of where I sprayed the perfume. Definitely disappointed.</li>
    <li> What a buy, much less than department stores.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife for a gift and she loves it. The smell will drive your man wild ladies.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume!! Cheaper than buying at the department store.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product, fast delivered. Smells great, good Price and size, I love it! Is perfect for any occasion.</li>
    <li> LOVE ...LOVE ...Happy !!! Nice clean smelling perfume!!!  Everyone wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing when they smell it !!! I wouldn&#x27;t even think about buying anything else !!! Fast ..Free Shipping !!! what more could I ask for !!!</li>
    <li> What can you really say about perfume? It is what it is. This was less exspensive that higher end stores.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite perfumes for about 10 years now. It lasts a long time, it is light smelling but effective, and I always get complimented whenever I wear it. It also is cheaper on Amazon than it is at the Clinique counter at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> gift well received, her signature scent</li>
    <li> came well packed. timely and love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Definetely shop this again.</li>
