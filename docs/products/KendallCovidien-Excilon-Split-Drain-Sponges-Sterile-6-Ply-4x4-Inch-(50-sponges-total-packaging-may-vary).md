    <li> I have a drain in my liver for the past 3 weeks.  These were the ones that the hospital supplied.  They have made changing the dressing of the spot so easy.  They fit very well around the tube.  Would use again if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update I had the drain for a total of 8 weeks and they made dressing changes doable</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of split gauze sponges.  Kendall has been consistently more absorbent and as a result, easier to handle.</li>
    <li> If you need split drain sponges in this size, look no further. This product arrived promptly and is exactly as described. The pre-split gauze saves time and effort in wound/dressing care.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my son who has been wearing a trach for 22 years. He uses them behind the trach to catch secretions from around the opening in his neck. Unfortunately I purchased the wrong size. I should have bought the 2&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34; size, but he just cuts them down and uses them anyway. I will be buying the smaller size next time.</li>
    <li> I am caring for my elderly Daddy and have to use these around the tube in his stomach.  They are great and a very good price as I have to use a new one every day and have since April 2012.</li>
    <li> items are very easy to use on a &amp;#34;peg&amp;#34; tube.  they are precut to fit around the tube and lay flat.  It&#x27;s just as easy to spend less and get the plain sponges.  take clean scissors and cut a &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; in them, you have the same thing.</li>
    <li> It was delivered to us in a timely fashion and does its job well. Love it!</li>
    <li> We ran out a lot sooner than 50 days. I don&#x27;t think the count was accurAte.</li>
    <li> The split drain sponges are a must when caring for my spouse&#x27;s tubes - much easier than trying to cut a normal sponge or gauze pad.  This is the same brand/size of drain sponge used in the hospital when he had the tubes placed.  The Amazon price is less than they cost locally- I just wish they were offered as a subscribe and save item.</li>
    <li> the box was really smashed and the pads were all loose in the packaging. but i like the pads just the right size for my use</li>
    <li> These are great for Trach pt.s</li>
    <li> cut perfectty to fit the G tube, a good feature to help keep the  tube entrance clean  will buy again</li>
    <li> No problem whatsoever with this order of the drain sponges. Good price. Thank you will come back when need arises.</li>
    <li> They do what they&#x27;re made to do.</li>
    <li> The product was as promised and arrived timely but a hard cardboard shipping box would have been appreciated.  The product was stuffed in an envelope and was squashed.  I&#x27;m picky about the condition of such things-otherwise it was fine.</li>
    <li> well packaged and exactly as described. They are exactly the same as the hospital gave us.</li>
    <li> These were used on my husbands tracheostomy at the hospital and when I packed up his room to come home, I took the open box with us.  The ones provided by the medical supply company were just scratchy gauze and not near as effective as these.  I have chosen to purchase these myself and pay out of pocket as oppossed to accepting the lesser quality ones covered under our health insurance.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s money well spent!!</li>
    <li> The six ply absorbs fluids from the wound well and the precut slit really helps for the tube to fit into the slot so you don&#x27;t have to cut it yourself.</li>
    <li> These drain sponges are priced right. are of excellent quality. they don&#x27;t fray or unravel or tear apart. a good buy</li>
    <li> I needed some sterile sponges to use for my son after surgery.  These are great as they already have a slit in them!</li>
    <li> very satisfactory, but I can purchase much cheaper locally.</li>
    <li> Excellent products and super fast delivery</li>
    <li> These are expensive but high quality for wound treatment and cleaning. They were the closest thing to match what was given to us in the hospital.</li>
    <li> This is a real time-saver if you have a relative who has a gastric tube, drain or other surgically installed device. These drain sponges allow you to keep the surgical area covered without blocking the drain, without you having to buy a brand new scissors to sterile-ly create your own crosshatch incision in a gauze pad. You never want to HAVE to deal with this kind of medical situation -- but when you do, boy, is it ever helpful to know that products like this exist to make everything easier!</li>
