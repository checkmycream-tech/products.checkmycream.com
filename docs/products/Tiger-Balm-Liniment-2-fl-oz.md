      <li>great and in my opinion the best if your into physical activities like Martial Arts or even football!</li>
      <li>My wife really enjoys a good shoulder rub with this.</li>
      <li>This is an easy product to apply and lasts for about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t stain and applies easily.</li>

      <li>It is OK on my knees, shins and ankles where the skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive.</li>
      <li>A few drops of liquid tiger liniment in a hot bath is more effective than spending $200.00 at a spa.</li>
      <li>Unlike the regular Tiger Balm in the pot, this stuff goes on very easily.</li>
      <li>Like any good non-chemical product - you are getting the pure menthol and other pure oils....</li>
      <li>Not my first rodeo.</li>
      <li>Have used Tiger Baum for 15 years but this is the first try at liniment.</li>
      <li>The packaging recommends that you don&#x27;t apply it after a hot shower.  </li>
      <li>Getting harder to find locally so was happy to find it here.</li>
      <li>The paste came melted, half full and most of it was stuck to the lid.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much of it all over</li>
      <li>My husband wants a case.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for those swollen glands when you get a cold or sinus infection.</li>

      <li>Super pain relieve for tense neck, pulled muscle and more.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>If you do decide to purchase it....which I highly recommend....</li>
      <li>This has quickly become my favorite topical analgesic following hard training.</li>
      <li>the only thing that really works on old knees.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like this as much as the regular tiger balm because the liniment burns my skin if I use it on my neck of thighs.  </li>
      <li>The onset of action also seems to be quicker than the balms.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you if you take a hot shower and then quickly dry off and apply this product, you will feel the burn.  </li>
      <li>particulary if you rub into areas which are typically sensitive or if you have an open cuts or sores.     </li>
      <li>and it will stain your clothes if you are not careful in its application.      </li>
      <li>it burns a little if you put to much on.</li>

<li> However, you have to be very careful that the product does not get into any \\&quot;sensitive</li>
<li> I have had a bottle of this sitting around for a few years now and keep discovering new things to use it for.</li>
<li> helps relax my muscles after a long day of work.</li>
<li> just be careful in applying it.  </li>
<li> I am a disabled veteran with severe arthritis.</li>

<li> as I said, I wouldn&#x27;t overdo it due to the risk of overdose.</li>
<li> no more words... only dancing.</li>
<li> The only down side to the product is the small bottle size.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s very powerful ...and it will cause a terrible burning reaction ...</li>

<li> Very very disappointed.</li>
<li> I had terrible radiating pain from a toothache</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great product and helps with aches and pains.  Just don&#x27;t use too much of it all over or it could potentially be harmful.  The packaging recommends that you don&#x27;t apply it after a hot shower.  Let me tell you if you take a hot shower and then quickly dry off and apply this product, you will feel the burn.  To me its a pleasant feeling but as I said, I wouldn&#x27;t overdo it due to the risk of overdose.</li>
    <li> Unlike the regular Tiger Balm in the pot, this stuff goes on very easily. And it&#x27;s Tiger Balm, so it&#x27;s a very useful and wonderful product for those sore muscles.</li>
    <li> A few drops of liquid tiger liniment in a hot bath is more effective than spending $200.00 at a spa.My husband wants a case. This product is great for anyone that has had back problems or any body aches.</li>
    <li> I have had a bottle of this sitting around for a few years now and keep discovering new things to use it for. I use it for arthritis pain in my knee and on my neck and temples for migraines. My friend told me to try a little on a wasp sting and it worked great to stop the pain. I had terrible radiating pain from a toothache so I rubbed some on my jaw and it helped ease the pain until I could get to the dentist. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> regret buying. not as potent as the balm. waste of money</li>
    <li> I am a disabled veteran with severe arthritis. I&#x27;ve tried everything out there. Nothing I&#x27;ve found works better the Tiger. Nothing. This is an easy product to apply and lasts for about 15 minutes. The only down side to the product is the small bottle size.</li>
    <li> This liniment smells great and really works well to relieve tension and sore muscles. My wife really enjoys a good shoulder rub with this.</li>
    <li> This Tiger Liniment is the best thing for migraines.  I get them from time to time and this liniment usually eliminates them.  I apply the liniment with a cotton ball on my forehead and temples and then lay down.  The liniment starts to tingle on your skin and counteracts with the pain pressure.  It works better than any headache pill.</li>
    <li> Much better than the balm, once rubbed in and you have put clothing over it, you can feel it warming up the muscles.  Helps my tennis elbow a lot so that I can continue to bench heavy.</li>
    <li> I apply it to my mom&#x27;s painful arms, back, and legs and it relieves her pain.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great I have been trying to find it for over 3 yrs in my area. its real thin but packs a hell of a punch! great and in my opinion the best if your into physical activities like Martial Arts or even football! It is great for minor sprains and bruises. I got punched and kicked allot and these stuff helped out more than my ex! lol</li>
    <li> great stuff.  I have been using it for several years and always had to go to the coast for purchase.  quite happy i can get it on line.  works much better than the tiger balm products i have used before</li>
    <li> This has quickly become my favorite topical analgesic following hard training. This has some raw power that people who are used to the regular tiger balm products will appreciate. It also doesn&#x27;t stain and applies easily. The onset of action also seems to be quicker than the balms.</li>
    <li> This product DOES go on like water, but it has NO EFFECT!  There is no sensation of cooling, heat...NOTHING!  It does NOT relieve my pain at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Hello,  I have been using Tiger Balm Linament for over 9 years now.  I have a form of rheumentoid arthritis &amp; a serious back condition which can&#x27;t be operated...and on those days when either my back or my arthritis \\&quot;flares up\\&quot; - besides taking my prescriptions - I rub in my Tiger Balm on the sore areas...and wake up the next day with the majority of pain and discomfort eased up or gone.      I have recommended this product several time to friends and colleages who have experienced very good results.  However, you have to be very careful that the product does not get into any \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot; such as eyes, ears, sores, mouth, etc.  It&#x27;s very powerful ...and it will cause a terrible burning reaction ...particulary if you rub into areas which are typically sensitive or if you have an open cuts or sores.     Also, I have used it on my forehead and temples when I have had a serious almost migrane headache or behind my ears when I have bad sinsus problems.  I have rubbed it lightly on my neck when I have had a severe sore throat.  Tiger Balm helps to soothe these areas as well.  It&#x27;s wonderful for those swollen glands when you get a cold or sinus infection. For me...I can never be without it....especially in the winter months when rain, snow and dampness sets into my joints.      If you do decide to purchase it....which I highly recommend....just be careful in applying it.  Like any good non-chemical product - you are getting the pure menthol and other pure oils....and it will stain your clothes if you are not careful in its application.      Tiger Balm is a healer....and for me a \\&quot;miracle worker.\\&quot;  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fell no effect at all. Have used Tiger Baum for 15 years but this is the first try at liniment. Very very disappointed. Goes on like water and is of no benefit. Save your money. The paste came melted, half full and most of it was stuck to the lid. Not my first rodeo. Won&#x27;t buy from them again if this is what they ship. Not the Tiger Baum I&#x27;ve bought before. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but hard now to find in liquid form. Also will buy again. Recommend it for all ligament &amp; muscle problems.</li>
    <li> I use this for my aches and pains around my shoulders and neck due to sitting in front of a computer most of the day.  It works well for me and you don not need to apply a lot of it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe in magic until I rubbed some of this liniment on my legs and felt that liquid fire seep into my muscles, AWAKENING THEM! Awakening them....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are... no more words... only dancing.</li>
    <li> i have only good things to say. helps relax my muscles after a long day of work. it burns a little if you put to much on. definite recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this as much as the regular tiger balm because the liniment burns my skin if I use it on my neck of thighs.  It is OK on my knees, shins and ankles where the skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, works great on bruises and sore muscles. Getting harder to find locally so was happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> Super pain relieve for tense neck, pulled muscle and more. It goes on every trip with me.</li>
    <li> Keep carrying this- the only thing that really works on old knees.</li>
    <li> works wonders on my lower back,  easy to apply and excellent results.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be really good, but it wasn&#x27;t that great! It definitely has a cooling affect and helps to relax muscles, but no more than your typical products like bengay.</li>
