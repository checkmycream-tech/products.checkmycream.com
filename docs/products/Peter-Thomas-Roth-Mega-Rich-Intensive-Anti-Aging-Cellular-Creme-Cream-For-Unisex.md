      <li>I&#x27;ve just recently purchased this &amp; fortunately just discovered</li>
      <li>I really cannot see them anymore.</li>
      <li>; soothing on dry older skin, seeps into the surface and gives a healthy glow</li>
      <li>I started developing deep wrinkles (lines you can see when face is at rest) and purchsed this due to good reviews.  </li>
      <li>Use small amount, it doesn&#x27;t take much as it spreads nicely over skin (per his statements)</li>

      <li>I have been using this cream for several months and it moisturizes and smooth the skin around my eyes and mouth, definite keeper.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive, drying skin in the winter and</li>
      <li>Moisturizers and makes my skin smooth and wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
      <li>I really like this product in the Middle East</li>

      <li>I have sensitive skin and eyes</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like old lady cream either which is pleasing to my husband.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old</li>
      <li>I always seemed to be searching for a moisturizer that would be super hydrating and long lasting, but non-pore clogging.  </li>
      <li>I think after about 4-5 years of daily use it has actually helped maintain his skin better than any of the other products he has tried.</li>
      <li>Since amazon wasn&#x27;t an authorized seller i&#x27;m pretty sure i bought a fake product.</li>
      <li>Worth the price and little is needed.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>There are other products that not only less expensive but also more effective.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it is any better than any of the other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I am going to buy as many jars of this that i can afford once my next check comes in, because I am afraid that they may stop making this product, as is what happens to things you really like, all the sudden you cant find them anymore.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the third time I have purchased this product, with the best pricing on Amazon.com.  I try to go without it, but my skin drastically changes - dry, break-outs, dull.  The jar lasts for months. Very rich without any greasy or heavy feeling at all.  Product is not scented, nor does it have a chemical or base lotion scent.  I have sensitive skin and eyes and I have never had any irritation.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It felt thick when I first put it on, but it disappeared into the skin and it actually makes your face feel like it is tightened? But not in a bad way, it feels like you have some of your youth back. Skin is silky next morning. Would buy again, promplty shipped.</li>
    <li> This stuff never did work for me</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream. It feels great on skin. It is very consentrated and moisturizes great. A little of it goes a long way and it makes the skin feel so supple and tender. I believe it is way better than Lancome, Chanel, CD, or all product on the market. I recented stayed in a hotel which used all Peterthomasroth product. All its product is great from face soap bar, shampoo, conditioner to body lotion. It is really a great skincare line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that not every seller sells product new and fresh. I bought another cream of PeterThomasRoth from shopgirl through Amazon. The cream came smell stale like oil gone bad. It was poorly packaged and that made me wonder if it is the real thing. Anyway, this one from this seller has no problem. Cream came fresh and smell great. I will certainly order again.</li>
    <li> I almost purchased this creme based on the reviews and ingredient list. I double checked the ingredient list on the Peter Thomas Roth website &amp; there they were.. PARABENS. Proplyparaben, Methylparaben. Cheap preservatives used by manufacturers to extend the shelf life. Parabens are endocrin distruptors that have an estrogen like effect in your body &amp; play havoc on your hormone levels. Breast cancer patients with \\&quot;estrogen\\&quot; type cancer are to avoid products with such ingredients because they are known to stimulate tumors. I find it suspicious that Amazon conveniently left those ingredients off the posted list......</li>
    <li> I have dry skin at times and this cream definitely hydrates my skin.  It is mega rich in that sense.  It is not heavy feeling and soaks in quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like old lady cream either which is pleasing to my husband.</li>
    <li> I luckily received a sample of this product when shopping at another online store.  I purchased and have not regretted one minute.  I have very sensitive, drying skin in the winter and the creme is perfect for nighttime use.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently purchased this &amp; fortunately just discovered Amazon.com offers this for a WAY better price! Will purchase from here next time...LOVE this cream! As previous reviewers stated, it makes a huge difference in my skin! I&#x27;m 48 &amp; have some sun damage &amp; lines, especially on my forehead. This cream used nightly, after the PTR peel pads &amp; Retinol serum has taken YEARS off of  my complexion! My skin glows, is soft, tighter &amp; lines/wrinkles diminished. I&#x27;ve used MANY skin creams/serums, etc. &amp; honestly this is the ONLY line of skin care I will touch from now on. Give this a try, you will NOT be disappointed !</li>
    <li> I really like this product in the Middle East the weather is harsh and this makes my skin look dewy and soft love it</li>
    <li> This is a great companion to PTR&#x27;s RX Serum. I absolutely see an immediate improvement to my skin&#x27;s color, tone and elasticity. Definately would recommend this to someone with aging, dry, dehydrated skin. It gives a luminous effect and delivers on what it promises!</li>
    <li> This is the best face creme I&#x27;ve ever used. Just a week after using the product consistently, I&#x27;ve been getting many complements on my skin and I do see a difference!  The formula is very creamy and spreads well.  You don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
    <li> Okay, i bought this item because of the great customer reveiws, and I am glad I did. I have been using this product for the past two weeks and the results are amazing. Really, my skintone has improved, I am pale, but prone to redness, I live in Colorado and it is dry dry dry here, and the sun shines all the dang time. I am 40 and starting to see fine lines around my eyes and it was getting to be really depressing for me. So I took a chance that this product might help me. Well, my skin is very creamy and the fine lines are virtually gone. I really cannot see them anymore. It is weird, but even when I smile, they look much much finer, and have to look closely to even find a trace of them. I am going to buy as many jars of this that i can afford once my next check comes in, because I am afraid that they may stop making this product, as is what happens to things you really like, all the sudden you cant find them anymore. I also have applied this on my neck and chest, they are very sun damaged, and I see improvements there as well. I really swear by this. I am impressed by what I see in the mirror now. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Would not use any other anti aging creme. I have found that Peter Thomas Roth products have the best results.  The night creme is a little thick, so give a few minutes before you go to bed.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased PTR Mega Rich Intensive Eye Cream and TREND MARKETING shipped me the wrong item...an EYE GEL by PTR.  This is a stupid mistake and this company should be removed from AMAZON.  I have to call customer service and dick around with a return now.  How dumb thou art??</li>
    <li> This man truly understands what women want for their faces and I love all of his products so glad Amazon carries it since I live in a small town.</li>
    <li> If this cream didn&#x27;t had parabens i would had easily gave it 5 stars. It worked amazing when i got it the first time on sephora, second when i bought from amazon not so much. Since amazon wasn&#x27;t an authorized seller i&#x27;m pretty sure i bought a fake product. Not of that matters it has parabens.</li>
    <li> I love this lotions...perfect for the winter months, but not even too heavy for the summer.  It really makes my skin feel very smooth and has reduced fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and I use this cream at night. Although it&#x27;s very rich and nourishing it&#x27;s not sticky or too thick. Skin absorbs it quickly. It does leave your face shiny tough. Despite the mega rich properties it has I never had allergies or breakouts. It does tons of good to my skin. My complexion is more supple, soft and luminous. The expression lines have been dramatically smoothed out. Recomended.</li>
    <li> After moving to a more humid climate, my skin became really dehydrated and flakey. I always seemed to be searching for a moisturizer that would be super hydrating and long lasting, but non-pore clogging.  I ended up buying extra oils and serums, as no cream seemed to last all day.  Until I found this.  I have been using this cream for over a year now and it is all my skin needs, morning and night.  It has every good for the skin ingredient I have ever heard of in one pot.  Keeps my skin soft and clear.  Great for older skins that are dehydrated, dry or combination/sensitive.  I go though this pretty quickly though, so am glad I found the deals here on Amazon/Payless.</li>
    <li> Long lasting: One jar should last me about four months. Moisturizers and makes my skin smooth and wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth Products are great! This creme leaves my face looking younger. It softens and lessens the appearance of wrinkles  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face.</li>
    <li> The cream is okay however I am very disappointed with the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I stared using it, I noticed that there are something black in the cream. I Just took the part out but the second time, something black again in the cream as well as my fingers. I realized the black is from the ink of the logo on the lid. It is so cheaply printed, whenever I touch the lid to open it, the ink is coming off and get smeared. I found myself trying not to touch the prints whenever opening which is very hard since the brand name is printed all around the lid. I just can&#x27;t believe and am upset how cheaply it was made and how annoying it is to use the cream I paid over $50!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably a great moisturizer but I&#x27;m not sure it is any better than any of the other ones I&#x27;ve used. I have gone back to my trusted night-time moisturizer but I&#x27;m using this for the little re-hydrating crisis that come around once in a while. It is just a little too pricey.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I have bought this product before and have been very happy with it and the results it gives.</li>
    <li> I use this only when my skin is extremely dry. Otherwise it is too greasy for daily use. The packaging - a pot - is not sanitary.</li>
    <li> Massive break-out. Review the ingredients. Took a week and no make-up before my face returned to normal. At my age, surprising to see blemishes on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in texture and lines appear reduced. I will keep buying this product. Worth the price and little is needed.</li>
    <li> Fee; soothing on dry older skin, seeps into the surface and gives a healthy glow</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this as its way too thick for my sensitive skin. Husband works outside every day of his life for over 40 years now. He likes this product and uses it every night. Says it helps with dry skin without feeling heavy or greasy. He has very fair skin that freckles and lines easily. I think after about 4-5 years of daily use it has actually helped maintain his skin better than any of the other products he has tried. Too bad its so costly. Use small amount, it doesn&#x27;t take much as it spreads nicely over skin (per his statements)</li>
    <li> I thought I had noticed a difference in my forehead lines and lines around my eyes but when my best friend called me later after we had met for coffee and made a comment how great my skin was looking I knew it wasn&#x27;t just me! I wwas sent a sample of the firmx as well which is like a miracle temporary fix. I am waiting for that order. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Although they say to use it twice a day, I have been using it one time, before bed. I must say, I see a lot of improvement on  my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my mom (age 53) who used it faithfully until the last drop. After continued use, we observed absolutely zero reduction in wrinkles and fine lines. I would NOT recommend this product to other consumers. Save your money and invest in a product that delivers results! There are other products that not only less expensive but also more effective.</li>
    <li> I chose this creme after asking my daughter why her skin looked so beautiful.  It keeps my skin moist and pliant all night. This order was my third order of creme.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for several months and it moisturizes and smooth the skin around my eyes and mouth, definite keeper.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for the price...Love PTR products. Light and really helps with the sun damaged skin. I&#x27;m a return customer many times over. Thank you PTR.</li>
    <li> I started developing deep wrinkles (lines you can see when face is at rest) and purchsed this due to good reviews.  The cream is a little heavy (to me) for morning use, so I use it at night.  My skin has shown significant improvement over the past few months.  It has a light scent and a little goes a long way.  I dab a little extra on my problem areas and under my eyes.  Will order again but one jar lasts a long time!</li>
