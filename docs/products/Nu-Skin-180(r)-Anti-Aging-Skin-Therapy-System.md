<li> It is tighter and the small lines seem to me that they are less deep.</li>
<li> I am less shiny and my pores seem tighter (to me at least).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life.</li>

    <li> My skin is so soft and moisturizered. I have been using this  product for 45 days now and really like how my skin looks and feels. I may introduce some other products from this company to try out very soon.</li>
    <li> just perfect. I&#x27;ve using this item for 3 days. My face is changing now.</li>
    <li> to all my friends but I dint get the other items so am not too happy with amazon the nuskin 180 aha facial peel and neutralizer</li>
    <li> As advertised. Fast shipping. Would recommend to other buyers. A+</li>
    <li> To purchase Nu Skin products, go to  nuskin com, click on your country, then click on &amp;#34;Sign up as Customer&amp;#34; and enter sponsor ID: USW8836585&lt;br /&gt;If you would like 30% discount, sign up as a distributor, by going to nuskin com, click on your country, click on &amp;#34;Sign up as distributor&amp;#34; and enter sponsor ID:USW8836585</li>
    <li> Please note that a Sponsor Distributor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a good reason. Would you want someone unethical to be your business partner? What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to become an active distributor? If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life. I had bought Nu Skin products about 5 years ago from a beauty salon and I love it. Now, I&#x27;m a distributor and have a wonderful sponsor distributor to help and guide me to grow my Nu Skin business. This might be the business opportunity that you&#x27;ve been looking for and it may become your future and retirement income one day. Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
    <li> i am happy to get this with cheap price!! lol</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law loves it!</li>
    <li> I have only been using it a few weeks, but i do notice a difference in my skin. It is tighter and the small lines seem to me that they are less deep. I am 42 and I think this product is working. I do have oily skin and bigger pores on my t-zone area, and I do believe that this product is helping in that area. I am less shiny and my pores seem tighter (to me at least).&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because I only have been using it for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product it really works. I love it</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I have ever used that makes a visible difference. I am an older woman and I get constant comments&lt;br /&gt;about how wrinkle free my face looks.</li>
    <li> this is a very good product but I think I like the dead sea product a little better. I will buy nu skin tinted moisterizer more so than this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. She likes the product very much!</li>
    <li> I like this one and thank you for quick delievery.</li>
