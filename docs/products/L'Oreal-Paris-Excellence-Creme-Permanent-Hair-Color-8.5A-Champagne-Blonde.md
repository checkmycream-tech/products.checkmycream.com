<li> I  noticed this has happened before, I am not not first.</li>
<li> I thought buying this would subtly even out my hair color, it just barely toned my hair color and lightened my dark brown roots to a medium brown.</li>
<li> I use half a box just for root touch-ups every 6 weeks or so.</li>
<li> Im going to have to go to a salon and pay a ton of money to fix this mess.</li>
<li> Too much trouble to return.</li>
<li> I usually order an ash shade, as I have trouble with brassy tones.  </li>
<li> Not cute.</li>
<li> My hair usually looks brassy after coloring.  </li>
<li> Leaves hair a dull, grey, ugly sort of mousy blonde.</li>
<li> They sent the wrong shade.  </li>
<li> One star off because unable to evaluate my satisfaction with the champagne shade,  I ordered.  </li>
<li> : I had an inescapable headache for two days after using this dye :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Hated this product.</li>
<li> disgusting now</li>

    <li> work perfect for me.  wish it lasted longer however.</li>
    <li> Ended up with a dullish looking natural blonde but it&#x27;s nice. Some highlights will make it look good. Word to the wise: I had an inescapable headache for two days after using this dye :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Got rid of the brassy/goldish tones left from going from red hair back to blonde (my natural state, wish i had never dyed it when i was younger!) ...&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Leaves hair a dull, grey, ugly sort of mousy blonde. Not cute. But it works fine as a toner/gold remover.</li>
    <li> champagne blonde 8.5 turned my hair ORANGE and YELLOW, disgusting now Im going to have to go to a salon and pay a ton of money to fix this mess. ugh.</li>
    <li> This is a good color and seems to last. I like the natural looking highlights that it adds to my hair to give it a more natural appearance.</li>

    <li> Rating is for the hair color alone, since I have used it so many times. I love it.  It is excellent hair color. One star off because unable to evaluate my satisfaction with the champagne shade,  I ordered.  I usually order an ash shade, as I have trouble with brassy tones.  I thought I would try champagne this time. They sent the wrong shade.  I received two boxes of Golden blonde which I can’t use. Don’t want golden blonde. Too much trouble to return. I  noticed this has happened before, I am not not first.</li>
    <li> Love the color - covers grey well! Probably need to order two next time as my hair is extremely long.</li>
    <li> Super awesome and amazing! A winner that is sure to please. I&#x27;m sure you be glad if you pick this one up</li>
    <li> Always go back to Loreal. Used another product at twice the price and everyone said, &amp;#34;Love the haircut, but I liked your other color better.&amp;#34; Back to Loreal!</li>
    <li> I like L&#x27;Oreal haircolor.  Application is smooth and does not seem to overly dry hair out.  Covers grey hair well.</li>
    <li> I have used this color by L&#x27;Oreal for years. It covers the gray I am getting and gives my hair shine and body. I found a winner with this a long time ago and I am sticking with it!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly with no damage to item.</li>
    <li> I always order and use this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1 year now, and am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I like this haircolor. The color is true to the color you see on the box. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering like some of the other brands, and it was very easy to apply. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Good Product.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was Timely.</li>
    <li> After bleaching my hair with L&#x27;Oreal Feria Extra Bleach blonding, I used this medium ash blonde color to correct the brassy gold and red it left me with.  My hair is a little darker blond than I&#x27;d like, but it looks more natural and left my hair in better condition than before.  All it takes is 25 minutes and you&#x27;re done.  Recommended highly to repair lightening that has gone haywire.</li>
    <li> WOW!  WHAT GORGEOUS HAIR I HAVE! I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS! DOES NOT &amp;#34;BLEACH OUT&amp;#34; MY HAIR. KEEPS IT NATURAL LOOKING AND SOFT. HEALTHY AND CONDITIONED. THAE COLOR IS EXACTLY AS ON THE BOX. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND TO A FRIEND.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal products and Excellence is one of the best of their hair color line.  The conditioner is great and the color is true.  The Champagne Blonde is not too light and never brassy or greenish ash.  I get alot of complements about how great my hair looks!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used this color for years. I use half a box just for root touch-ups every 6 weeks or so. Easy application and great color. I receive a lot of compliments on how pretty my hair color is. I used to be a medium brown but now my hair is about the color depicted on the box. It IS true that blondes have more fun!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color it&#x27;s cool blonde so it evenly. No red or brass...... true It will be in better shape and fixes all those many colors of bleaching..... I love this brand and color........</li>
    <li> Great hair color, comes with pre and post conditioner.  Color lasts and is kind to your hair.</li>
    <li> Hated this product. My hair is a light brown with dark blonde ends (a deep/subtle ombre) and my dark brown roots were growing in. I thought buying this would subtly even out my hair color, it just barely toned my hair color and lightened my dark brown roots to a medium brown. The rest of my hair is the exact same color and I even heat processed it for 30 minutes. I&#x27;ve had better results with baking soda and peroxide.</li>
    <li> Love the color! My blonde tends to turn redish orange, but this cool ash blonde is perfect.</li>
    <li> Love the color, made my hair feel and look awesome. It arrived quickly as well.</li>
