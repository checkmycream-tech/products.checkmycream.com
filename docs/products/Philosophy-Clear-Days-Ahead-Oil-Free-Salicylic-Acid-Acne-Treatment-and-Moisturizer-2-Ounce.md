      <li>The product itself seems to be working well for me, a good mix of hydration and blemish/rosacea control.</li>

      <li>This is a good product for her to use as her nighttime moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using as well under a heavier cream and loving it.</li>
      <li>When this came out, I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>Just like many Philosophy products, this product delivers.</li>
      <li>This is a repeat purchase and the price is so much better than through Nordstrom etc.  </li>
      <li>and I both love it.</li>
      <li>Does everything it says and more.  </li>
      <li>it din&#x27;t get any better.</li>
      <li>Fewer breakouts, better texture.</li>
      <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>It maintains a nice smooth, shine resistant, matte layer of moisturizer ...</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how my face would react to it, so I just started dabbing a bit on some problem areas.</li>
      <li>(Beats Pro-Active and many more)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Honestly, coming from a makeup artist, I&#x27;m telling you that this is hands down the BEST PRODUCT on the market at this time!!  </li>
      <li>This is great for maintaining a clear complexion and it leaves my skin feeling</li>
      <li>I use this at night before I go to bed, right after washing my face, and I literally wake up with clearer pores and a nice dewy glow to my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin has started to clear up, though, thanks to this and my best friend Mr. Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
      <li>I have mild acne and it flares up more around my period.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, it&#x27;s completely worth the price.</li>
      <li>the oil free version.</li>
      <li>vary smooth and even.</li>
      <li>And your face feels incredibly smooth..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no longer breaking out along my chin and jawline and even my pores have significantly reduced.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to use this product, but it gave me acne in places I never had it before, like my chin and forehead.  </li>
      <li>Nothing overly special to talk about with this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this whole line.</li>
      <li>love this so much</li>
      <li>The products cleared up my skin quickly while making it feel a lot smoother and softer.</li>
      <li>I began using this along with the face wash and wipes and have seen a tremendous improvement.</li>
      <li>but when it stopped working I tried this product based on many other user reviews for adult breakouts and this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>It works even better with its partner, Philosophy&#x27;s, Clear Days</li>
      <li>But, if you want a moisturizer...you might as well just buy the $8.00 kind at your local drug store.</li>
      <li>I was so embarrassed of my skin, which is ironic because I was lucky in my youth and never had any skin issues.</li>
      <li>My sister actually commented on how smooth and pimple free my face looked.</li>
      <li>After Philosophy discontinued Hope in a Bottle two years ago, I tried many replacements from Philosophy and different companies.</li>
      <li>and I still haven&#x27;t used all of my first</li>
      <li>a well known makeup artist in South Florida, I highly recommend this product to teens thru metapause!!</li>
      <li>I really like the consistency of this product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have too much acne</li>
      <li>It really really helps..</li>
      <li>So if I&#x27;m writing one it is either because the product sucked beyond belief, or the product had to have really knocked my socks off.</li>
      <li>However, like other reviewers have said, the company could do way better with the packaging.</li>
      <li>The first time I have found something that really works to keep my skin clear.  </li>
      <li>I tried this though based on its high rating at beautypedia</li>
      <li>So i will stick with my normal acne treatment that cost $4.00 not $30.00.</li>
      <li>The problem is that the opening on the bottle is too large, so when you open the bottle too much comes out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame that the company hasn&#x27;t yet--in years of getting similar feedback--addressed the simple issue of a top with a smaller hole.</li>
      <li>Clean smell, great weight to the product (does not feel heavy or suffocating.)</li>
      <li>Clear Days</li>
      <li>I can say is, clear days are not ahead.</li>
      <li>Even my old spots are fading.</li>
      <li>my 11 yr old is going thru puberty</li>
      <li>My daughter (11yrs old) and myself (35) both use this as a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I have SEVERELY oily skin and adult acne, and this worsened both.</li>
      <li>I know this moisturizer works for many, but it was not a good match for me.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it gentle on the skin but it clears breakouts and prevents future ones.</li>
      <li>Since purchasing I have recommended to a few other people all of whom love this as well.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m an adult, I get the joy of dealing with it. :(</li>
      <li>Prior to using Clear Days Ahead, I was only washing my face with the Philosophy Purity cleanser and then using a Clinique acne treatment/moisturizer at night.</li>

<li> My daily regimen is I wash my face at night with Purity, I still dab a little of the Clear Days Ahead on problem areas and finish with the anti-aging moisturizer.</li>
<li> I am prone to adult acne and get a few breakouts a month due to oily skin so regular moisturizers do not work for me.  </li>
<li> Significantly less pimples + blackheads since I started using this and much clearer skin in less than three weeks!</li>
<li> I did notice a little bit of drying in that area, so last night I mixed some vitamin e oil into my night cream and woke up this morning with it all hydrated again.</li>
<li> I only recommend using it once a day, my skin seemed to get a little irritated and red if i used it twice a day</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and is non-irritating.</li>
<li> I would wait a couple of minutes for it to dry.</li>
<li> A great base before or without makeup!!</li>
<li> I know its pretty ridiculously priced, but it lasts a long time, especially if you only use it once a day like me--it has lasted me approximately 3 and a half months</li>
<li> The only down side is the price, it&#x27;s a little steep.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just like many Philosophy products, this product delivers. Used the entire tube and will order again. Clean smell, great weight to the product (does not feel heavy or suffocating.)</li>
    <li> My sister actually commented on how smooth and pimple free my face looked. Even my old spots are fading. I&#x27;m using it along with the face wash and Overnight repair from the same range.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 35, mom to 3 and have been suffering from very painful breakouts on my chin. I was trying everything that I could possibly find. I began using this along with the face wash and wipes and have seen a tremendous improvement. I&#x27;m no longer breaking out along my chin and jawline and even my pores have significantly reduced. I absolutely love it! I did notice a little bit of drying in that area, so last night I mixed some vitamin e oil into my night cream and woke up this morning with it all hydrated again.

    <li> This is a repeat purchase and the price is so much better than through Nordstrom etc.  I love this product!  The first time I have found something that really works to keep my skin clear.  I apply every night in problem areas (even if there is not an outbreak) and it works!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, coming from a makeup artist, I&#x27;m telling you that this is hands down the BEST PRODUCT on the market at this time!!  (Beats Pro-Active and many more)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this so much, it has 1% Salicylic Acid in it. It maintains a nice smooth, shine resistant, matte layer of moisturizer ... A great base before or without makeup!! I use this everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your prone to a few breakouts (which I have been lately after a hysterectomy and my hormones went crazy) this stuff is great!! It works even better with its partner, Philosophy&#x27;s, Clear Days Ahead Spot Treatment (which has 2% salicylic acid)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a well known makeup artist in South Florida, I highly recommend this product to teens thru metapause!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the &amp;#34;Hope in a Bottle&amp;#34; Philosophy used to sell, these is a good replacement.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a bottle. I have struggled with acne/large pores and blackheads since 4th grade. I&#x27;ve never had cooperative skin. My skin has started to clear up, though, thanks to this and my best friend Mr. Benzoyl Peroxide. I use this at night before I go to bed, right after washing my face, and I literally wake up with clearer pores and a nice dewy glow to my skin. It amazes me every time. In the morning I use Benzoyl Peroxide (in the form of AcneFree Foam Day Treatment) and Olay Regenerist Serum under my Makeup Forever Matte Velvet and Neutrogena Oil Control Powder.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever take the time to write reviews about products. So if I&#x27;m writing one it is either because the product sucked beyond belief, or the product had to have really knocked my socks off. This stuff is amazing. I know its pretty ridiculously priced, but it lasts a long time, especially if you only use it once a day like me--it has lasted me approximately 3 and a half months and I still haven&#x27;t used all of my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;All it takes is a little pea sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;If you have clog-prone pores and acne I would totaly recommend using this. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Just brilliant product.  Significantly less pimples + blackheads since I started using this and much clearer skin in less than three weeks!</li>
    <li> I use this every day as part of my acne treatment. I feel like a princess every time I put it on.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very bad acne but my skin is not the greatest.. I don&#x27;t use this every night but in and out.. Once I feel my skin is about to act up.. It really really helps.. And your face feels incredibly smooth.. Even until the next morning when I awake.. This is a must have.. Especially if you have problematic skin..</li>
    <li> Tried Pro Active for years but when it stopped working I tried this product based on many other user reviews for adult breakouts and this stuff is AMAZING! Not only is it gentle on the skin but it clears breakouts and prevents future ones. Since purchasing I have recommended to a few other people all of whom love this as well. Must buy!</li>
    <li> Does everything it says and more.  Great for combination skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter (11yrs old) and myself (35) both use this as a moisturizer.  I am prone to adult acne and get a few breakouts a month due to oily skin so regular moisturizers do not work for me.  This is a great moisturizer to wear underneath my foundation.  my 11 yr old is going thru puberty so her skin is a bit oily too.  This is a good product for her to use as her nighttime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have SEVERELY oily skin and adult acne, and this worsened both. Within 10 minutes of applying this it was as if I&#x27;d smeared Vaseline on my face.</li>
    <li> Nothing overly special to talk about with this product.  I did not fell like it helped at all. Stopped using after about a month .</li>
    <li> I know this moisturizer works for many, but it was not a good match for me.  I am 41 with rosacea and some acne due to hormonal changes..ugh.  I was so excited to use this product, but it gave me acne in places I never had it before, like my chin and forehead.  I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient is the culprit, but I prefer origins starting over..the oil free version.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter. She is happy with it. I&#x27;ve been using as well under a heavier cream and loving it. Fewer breakouts, better texture.</li>
    <li> After Philosophy discontinued Hope in a Bottle two years ago, I tried many replacements from Philosophy and different companies. When this came out, I was thrilled. My preteen daughter and I both love it.</li>
    <li> The Moisturizer is great. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and is non-irritating. The problem is that the opening on the bottle is too large, so when you open the bottle too much comes out.</li>
    <li> Prior to using Clear Days Ahead, I was only washing my face with the Philosophy Purity cleanser and then using a Clinique acne treatment/moisturizer at night. The Clinique product helped a little, but I still had breakouts. I have mild acne and it flares up more around my period. I stuck with the Purity cleanser and replaced the Clinique moisturizer with Philosophy Clear Days Ahead moisturizer. I wasn&#x27;t sure how my face would react to it, so I just started dabbing a bit on some problem areas. I would wait a couple of minutes for it to dry. To moisturize the rest of my face I used a small amount of Philosophy Miracle Worker Anti-aging cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, clear days are not ahead. They are already here! This moisturizer keeps my acne at bay. Every now and then I&#x27;ll get a pimple, but my face is the clearest it&#x27;s been in years. My daily regimen is I wash my face at night with Purity, I still dab a little of the Clear Days Ahead on problem areas and finish with the anti-aging moisturizer. In the mornings, I wash with Purity and use an SPF moisturizer on my face. That&#x27;s all I need. Let&#x27;s face it, Philosophy products aren&#x27;t the cheapest, but I&#x27;m a believer. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this whole line. The products cleared up my skin quickly while making it feel a lot smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes, but it didnt help with ACNE at all. But, if you want a moisturizer...you might as well just buy the $8.00 kind at your local drug store. it is DEFINITELY not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have too much acne but i do get the occasional breakout once a month. This is great for maintaining a clear complexion and it leaves my skin feeling vary smooth and even. It also acts as a great base to my makeup. I only recommend using it once a day, my skin seemed to get a little irritated and red if i used it twice a day so i just use the hope in a jar at night and this in the morning.</li>
    <li> It dosen&#x27;t work for me. It din&#x27;t make worse but it din&#x27;t get any better. So i will stick with my normal acne treatment that cost $4.00 not $30.00.</li>
