      <li>Great, super sharp nippers.</li>
      <li>So sharp and precise!!!  </li>
      <li>These are very, very sharp and very effective.  </li>
      <li>So far I am very pleased with these nippers, nice and sharp</li>
      <li>I first bought these from a nail salon.</li>
      <li>I bought these based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>But by far, these are the most &amp;#34;professional,&amp;#34; sharp, precise cuticle nippers I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment and well packaged.</li>
      <li>and the price is very reazonable</li>
      <li>I sometimes buy into the whole &amp;#34;you</li>
      <li>Really like them.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The silicon cover is very useful and necessary for safety.</li>
      <li>I love this nippers, they are really sharp.</li>

      <li>These cuticle nippers are affordable, sharp, and they last longer than most cuticle nippers.</li>
      <li>I was reluctant at first since the price was so low.</li>
      <li>The others are just pinchers, these are ultra-precise cutters, so sharp it amazes as you cleanly trim with no effort.  </li>
      <li>Very sharp &amp; accurate.</li>
      <li>Very sharp and precise.</li>
      <li>Super sharp.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing more pairs to have on hand for down the road!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons : none so far</li>
      <li>Super sharp blades!</li>
      <li>The only reason I give it 4 stars not 5 is it is getting dull and damaged quite easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are sharp and the vendor does ship fast.  </li>
      <li>So glad that I bought these--I already have at least 5 other cuticle nippers of varying prices that I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years and none compare to the quality of this item.  </li>
      <li>these are really sharp exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time.</li>

    <li> Great cutters. I first bought these from a nail salon. I was happy to find them on amazon when, after a year, I nicked the tip. They stay sharp for a long time. Definitely salon quality.</li>
    <li> Super sharp blades! Be careful. I love the handles because they&#x27;re rounded out to fit your hand for more control of the nippers.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on all the positive reviews.  However, after one week they broke.  Yes, one side of the &#x27;nipper&#x27; broke off while I was clipping my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp and the vendor does ship fast.  That being said, if they only last a week, why bother?</li>
    <li> Awesome! They are, to date, the best nippers I have used (10 years in the business)! Fast shipment and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Very sharp as advertised. The silicon cover is very useful and necessary for safety. I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Much better than the drugstore ones.</li>
    <li> the best for the price ..&lt;br /&gt; pro : do everything that a cuticle nipper is supposed​ to do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons : none so far</li>
    <li> Well made. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. Really like them.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Delivered on time</li>
    <li> I was reluctant at first since the price was so low. I sometimes buy into the whole &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; theory. I went ahead and ordered the Nghia cuticle nippers after I had already bought three  other cuticle nippers at beauty supply stores (two of them were about 35 each and the third on was 50 dollars). Each were horrible and not what I expected.  So I took a risk and ordered these nippers and was completely pleased! They are, however, very sharp and if you&#x27;re not careful you can really cut yourself rather easily. Just take your time using them. But by far, these are the most &amp;#34;professional,&amp;#34; sharp, precise cuticle nippers I have ever owned. I give myself a mani and pedi that is equal, if not better, than the salons. Wonderful purchase for a wonderful price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too sharp on the tip of the blades and I have to be really careful not to nip my skin off. Other wise it&#x27;s a really good nipper. It cuts like crazy!</li>
    <li> Amazing tool!!!  So sharp and precise!!!  My manicure looks so professionally done, cuticle looks great!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very sharp, perfect for trimming cuticles.  They are a little small if you also want to use them to trim nails.</li>
    <li> The Product is good but I received 2 of the 6 that I ordered the nose point are bent and i contact customer but no respond.</li>
    <li> Very good and sharp nippers.  Would definitely recommend them.  The only reason I give it 4 stars not 5 is it is getting dull and damaged quite easily.</li>
    <li> Excellent cuticle nippers</li>
    <li> So glad that I bought these--I already have at least 5 other cuticle nippers of varying prices that I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years and none compare to the quality of this item.  These are very, very sharp and very effective.  They&#x27;re the best and for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> These cuticle nippers are affordable, sharp, and they last longer than most cuticle nippers. Thank you great! ok ok ok</li>
    <li> Great, super sharp nippers. It comes with a vinyl case and a plastic tip guard. The price for the quality can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Great shopping experience Great product</li>
    <li> Does what it should, is well constructed and an excellent value for the price</li>
    <li> Very sharp high quality</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my cuticle nippers because the other ones broke.  The nippers are very good, and good price.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and precise. I&#x27;m thinking of getting another pair to sit in my desk at work.</li>
    <li> I love this nippers, they are really sharp. the best i bought so far. and the price is very reazonable</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with these nippers, nice and sharp and I hope they stay that way.</li>
    <li> Compared to the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name nippers I have used for 20 years, these are much much superior.  The others are just pinchers, these are ultra-precise cutters, so sharp it amazes as you cleanly trim with no effort.  I&#x27;m getting backups.</li>
    <li> Love them. Really sharp</li>
    <li> Very sharp nippers great for cutting cuticles! I am glad i bought it</li>
    <li> After my 3rd set of Tweezerman cutters needed replacement, I was about to order my 4th, but took a chance on these instead.  Boy am I glad I did.  The finishing, the precision, the SHARPNESS....all superior to Tweezerman&#x27;s current offerings.  I&#x27;m truly blown away.  I didn&#x27;t know what i was missing.  I never thought a set of nippers could work so well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail technician for 32 years and I have to say that these are the best nippers I&#x27;ve ever used! I am so pleased with the sharpness. I&#x27;ve been using them for a while now, and they have not dulled at all. Even after intense scrubbing for sanitation purposes, they work great! I will definitely be purchasing more pairs to have on hand for down the road!</li>
    <li> Very sharp &amp; accurate.</li>
    <li> these are really sharp exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time. The best!!!</li>
    <li> I finally found a cuticle nipper that works perfect</li>
