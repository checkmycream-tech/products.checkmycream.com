### Positive Reviews

<ol>

      <li>Even though I take the best care of it that I can, it&#x27;s damaged.</li>
      <li>My wife loves this product, always gives the best result.</li>
      <li>It is awesome.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t regret it, great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for someone who has porous relaxed hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great on severely damaged hair used every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Not the best one that&#x27;s available out there.</li>
      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>my friends loved it</li>
      <li>Good.</li>
      <li>I love this product have been using for years, its wonderful for making your hair strong again.</li>
      <li>Hair looks so healthy!</li>
      <li>This was the best intense treatment I have ever used.</li>
      <li>As good or better than Nexxus Emergencee, which is phenomenal.</li>
      <li>However, I thought I would see a grand difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, my hair was so damage and this product is magic, I will always use it.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more shine.</li>
      <li>but i honestly have to say it probably isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
      <li>My hair went from being frizzy, what my husband described as &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, quick to curl in humidity, unmanageable, and all around gross... to being soft, shiny, and perfect.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine (not in a cute way) thinning blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>Product was affordable and arrived quickly, and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I believe it fused most of my split ends together as it appears today that they are more or less gone.</li>
      <li>The Emergencee in the white bottle worked best for me previously.</li>
      <li>This is more economical than the Nexxus Emergencee, which ingredients are the exact same.</li>
      <li>(Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better).</li>
      <li>and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!  </li>
      <li>Dare I say, a stellar job?</li>
      <li>Holy cow, is this stuff amazing.</li>
      <li>I left this on for about 30 minutes, followed by a deep conditioner for several hours, and the results are incredible.</li>
      <li>The best product for damaged or weak hair!!</li>
      <li>and it really helped increase body and bounce in my hair.  </li>
      <li>It really helps strengthen the hair.</li>
      <li>Really softens my hair.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>and I blow-dry straight weekly.</li>
      <li>just make sure you put in on first, leave it on for about 10 minutes then wash your hair and put conditioner, because this product will make your hair hard as a rock if you decide to wash it first to use this product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
      <li>My hair stays in great condition for a while with this product, my hair is usually so dry, but this has helped my hair have shine without oil, if you know what i mean!</li>
      <li>One of my favorite products that is sometimes hard to get thru a retail store.</li>
      <li>It is to early for me to tell if the this product works for my hair.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast than I expected A++++ seller.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny for several shampoos for me.</li>
      <li>LAST TIME I BUY MY PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS ONLINE.</li>

<li> LAST TIME I BUY MY PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS ONLINE.</li>
<li> I have naturally dark brown curly hair that I have professionally bleached to a level 10 (platinum blonde)</li>
<li> I Used this product because I had been experiencing breakage and my hair has been falling out because of the flat iron.</li>
<li> Def a must buy for that extra treatment needed for dry brittle hair&#x27;</li>
<li> But it has really helped my hair alot, no more damaged split ends!</li>
<li> Recently it had started to feel really gross and heavy, like wet wool, and I was worried that it was time for drastic measures.</li>
<li> My bangs are badly damaged at the ends due to the perm and the fact that I hit this part of my hair hardest with the flat iron, but I just can&#x27;t go much shorter.</li>
<li> I use it and even leave it on when I want to curl my hair and dont want to use gel or any other products with harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> My hair feels soft and is shiny, plus there is a DRAMATIC reduction in the appearance of split ends.</li>
<li> I was seriously wondering if I would have to cut my hair off prior to purchasing this.</li>
<li> I just leave it on under a conditioning cap for a few minutes in the shower then rinse out and condition.</li>
<li> I will update this after using this product a few times.</li>
<li> It is not in bad shape, there just isn&#x27;t much of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Needless to say, my hair has taken a beating for the past several months.</li>
<li> I permed my hair in August 2011 thinking I might go for that look rather than messing with my hair each day, but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t stand the look, so I reverted back to heat styling.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m seriously amazed at how well this worked to repair my frazzled &#x27;do.</li>
<li> My hair was still dry, no life :-(.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s got a weird texture.</li>
<li> IS IT SUPPOSED TO SMELL LIKE CRAP?</li>

    <li> As good or better than Nexxus Emergencee, which is phenomenal. These are THE things I use to rebuild hair.</li>
    <li> The best product for damaged or weak hair!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product, always gives the best result.</li>
    <li> I permed my hair in August 2011 thinking I might go for that look rather than messing with my hair each day, but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t stand the look, so I reverted back to heat styling. Needless to say, my hair has taken a beating for the past several months. I tried to preserve it, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck. I checked out Nexxus&#x27;s Pro-Mend line a while back when I saw it at Costco. The Pro-Mend line did not appear to do anything for my hair except make it sticky. It appears that this is how Pro-Mend works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical. My bangs are badly damaged at the ends due to the perm and the fact that I hit this part of my hair hardest with the flat iron, but I just can&#x27;t go much shorter. If you are looking for something that reduces the appearance of split ends, you might try Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor (Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better). I used it just last night and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs. Dare I say, a stellar job? I believe it fused most of my split ends together as it appears today that they are more or less gone. I know they are still there, but I can&#x27;t see them. It is awesome. This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky. My hair feels soft and is shiny, plus there is a DRAMATIC reduction in the appearance of split ends. I believe continued use of this every two weeks as recommended will prevent further damage to my hair, plus keep those unsightly damaged ends fused together until they can be trimmed. I will update this after using this product a few times.</li>
    <li> Not the best one that&#x27;s available out there.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like how my hair felt after the treatments. The Emergencee in the white bottle worked best for me previously. My hair was still dry, no life :-(.</li>
    <li> Excellent...it was delivered on time!!!</li>
    <li> Really softens my hair.  I am going to purchase this again!</li>
    <li> This was the best intense treatment I have ever used. Loved it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this did nothing for me. it&#x27;s got a weird texture. my friends loved it but i honestly have to say it probably isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products that is sometimes hard to get thru a retail store.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I just leave it on under a conditioning cap for a few minutes in the shower then rinse out and condition. No need to re-shampoo when using this way, and I think that might strip out the effect. Leaves hair soft and shiny for several shampoos for me.</li>
    <li> Product was affordable and arrived quickly, and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My hair stays in great condition for a while with this product, my hair is usually so dry, but this has helped my hair have shine without oil, if you know what i mean! just make sure you put in on first, leave it on for about 10 minutes then wash your hair and put conditioner, because this product will make your hair hard as a rock if you decide to wash it first to use this product! But it has really helped my hair alot, no more damaged split ends! Hair looks so healthy!</li>
    <li> It works miracles saw improvement after just 2 uses!! Def a must buy for that extra treatment needed for dry brittle hair&#x27;</li>
    <li> This stuff works great on severely damaged hair used every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was severely damaged from heat and color but was brought&lt;br /&gt;back to life using this product.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff.</li>
    <li> Does its jobs and helps my hair</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  It is to early for me to tell if the this product works for my hair. I will do another review next month</li>
    <li> I Used this product because I had been experiencing breakage and my hair has been falling out because of the flat iron. Emergency has helped restore the bonds of my hair and make it stronger.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. This works for any type of hair. You won&#x27;t regret it, great product.</li>
    <li> Holy cow, is this stuff amazing. I was seriously wondering if I would have to cut my hair off prior to purchasing this. I have naturally dark brown curly hair that I have professionally bleached to a level 10 (platinum blonde) and I blow-dry straight weekly. Even though I take the best care of it that I can, it&#x27;s damaged. Recently it had started to feel really gross and heavy, like wet wool, and I was worried that it was time for drastic measures.

    <li> Good. However, I thought I would see a grand difference in my hair. I was expecting more shine.</li>
    <li> ANYONE SEEM TO NOTICE THE TYPO&#x27;S ON THE BOTTLE??? THIS DOES NOT SEEM LEGIT, LAST TIME I BUY MY PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS ONLINE. ALSO, I HAVE YET TO USE THIS TREATMENT ON SOMEONE.. IS IT SUPPOSED TO SMELL LIKE CRAP? BECAUSE THAT&#x27;S WHAT&#x27;S IN MY BOTTLE..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it with and without heat and see no difference. It really helps strengthen the hair. I can tell an immediate difference in the texture of my hair. It&#x27;s great for someone who has porous relaxed hair. This is more economical than the Nexxus Emergencee, which ingredients are the exact same.</li>
