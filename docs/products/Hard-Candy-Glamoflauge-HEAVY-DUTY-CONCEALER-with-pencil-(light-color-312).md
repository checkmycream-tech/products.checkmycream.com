      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>It has awesome coverage and it might be great for covering tattoo, but for daily use?....</li>
      <li>This cover has a nice, creamy texture and stays put.</li>
      <li>So for me, finding a good concealer is sooo important!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own, the product didn&#x27;t even fully cover the blue/green veins on my wrist (my after-purchase swatch spot).</li>
      <li>This concealer does have great coverage, and I loved it at first.</li>
      <li>Comes off very easily</li>
      <li>Love Love Love it!</li>
      <li>Those more skillful with make-up application may have ways to blend it in and make it look more like their own skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, the color is off and was a bit light for my fair skin.  </li>
      <li>I have very light skin</li>
      <li>This product offers very good coverage.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>which is why I feel like it will take me many more months before I run out.</li>

      <li>It stays on all day and is cheap!</li>
      <li>Need more devirsity in color for those of us of color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard many people compare it to Kat Von D&#x27;s tattoo concealer.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love makeup.</li>
      <li>I have some scars on my arm, I like this better than the Dermablend.</li>
      <li>I love the way it covers my scars</li>
      <li>Love me my furry friends.</li>
      <li>I have had issues with marks for eight years now, so I&#x27;ve tried many concealers.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite concealer.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great and covers age spots very well.  </li>
      <li>If you want you can also use a beauty blender so that it looks more like skin.</li>
      <li>I literally use a dab and it covers all of it on my cheek and more.</li>
      <li>I love this concealer</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>the consistence and the full cover is AMAZING</li>
      <li>wanted to really love this stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly or easily.</li>
      <li>I then tried application with a sponge, my (clean!) fingers, and a concealer brush.</li>
      <li>This item is good to a certain extent  </li>
      <li>very dry, so probably best used for people with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
      <li>It DOES build up quite quickly and can easily look nice to cake-face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very full coverage.</li>
      <li>It works better this way as the concealer works more like a medium to full coverage foundation now that I&#x27;ve re-purposed it.</li>
      <li>I apply with a fluffy tapered brush because it is more precise and gives a more flawless finish.</li>
      <li>Talk about FULL COVERAGE!</li>
      <li>It does blend easily...  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a very loyal MAC studio finish concealer in nc30 until I found this product.</li>
      <li>I first saw this concealer on a popular makeup guru&#x27;s Youtube channel.</li>
      <li>I tossed it in drawer as soon as I tested it and never looked back.orks more like a medium to full coverage foundation now that I&#x27;ve re-purposed it.</li>
      <li>it just looked cakey and u could see it accentuate my fine lines under the eyes.</li>
      <li>For that purpose it worked absolutely fine.</li>
      <li>It settles into fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Be forewarned, the colors run super light!</li>
      <li>It can be a little cakey if not blended all of the way, but this is the best concealer I have ever found!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow, this concealer is THICK. Very dense and covers up just about any blemish.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really picky about my concealers because I have skin that \\&quot;rejects\\&quot; makeup very easily. Also known as oxidation (makeup turns orange, makeup looks cakey). I have tried other concealers before because I get some NASTY under eye circles (thank you Italian/Middle Eastern genetics) and most of them tend to fill in lines that I don&#x27;t even know exist or start to oxidize and even flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts all day. Literally all day. Through sweat, work, this stuff STAYS/LASTS.&lt;br /&gt;- Looks natural and blends in nicely with my pale skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t require a lot! It&#x27;s so thick, a super small amount suffices.&lt;br /&gt;- Blends well with liquid foundations for nicer coverage.&lt;br /&gt;- Makes pimples disappear!&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my eyes look bright and awake!&lt;br /&gt;- Drew pen marks on my skin and it even covered that up COMPLETELY!&lt;br /&gt;- Dries quickly and didn&#x27;t need to use a powder to set it on my face....but then again I get dry skin. (I have combination skin if that helps)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Be careful how much you use! It DOES build up quite quickly and can easily look nice to cake-face.&lt;br /&gt;- The pencil is pretty pointless...It doesn&#x27;t cover THAT well. I use it for times when I make mistakes with my eyeliner and need to make my edges look sharper. Otherwise, I never use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! :D</li>
    <li> I got this to experiment with covering my tattoos in the event I wanted to wear short sleeves to work and they work so well! Just buy a transparent powder to finish it and frequently dab it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t transfer.</li>
    <li> It is entirely to light and doesnt cover as much as i thought.</li>
    <li> I attempted to use this prior to a wedding in order to cover up my tattoos. Bride didn&#x27;t want them showing and I was the made of honor. This product is runny and greasy and yet sticky. It didn&#x27;t conceal anything at all. It made a huge mess of my hands but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> If you want to cover a tattoo - this is it. There are even specific instructions on how to cover a tattoo.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in light, and it came in medium. As a very pale girl light is usually not even light enough. Either way i tried it. I bought it becase it said it could cover tattoos, and I have an unsightly old stick-n-poke mistake on my hand that is the worst for job interviews. I don&#x27;t have money to remove it, and my concealer wouldn&#x27;t cover it. I decided to try this. It covered a little, but not nearly how I exoected it to, and it washed and rubbed off pretty easily. I don&#x27;t know how it covers pimples and skin irritation because I didn&#x27;t try that. If you&#x27;re getting this for tattoo coverup, try something else.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite concealer. I use urban decay, too faced, etc and come back to my hard candy concealer. A little goes a long way. I use it under my eyes and have finally found something to cover my dark circles!  Haleileugh!  It only took 50 years!  (I started out with max factor &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; stick that did not erase anything)  Get this to cover anything!  Well, I don&#x27;t know about tats, but I hear it covers those well also. Also, Hard Candy does NOT test on animals which is important to me. ❤️  Love me my furry friends.</li>
    <li> First off, everyone who is saying it is too cakey, you should try it on any spots or pigmentation you may have. That is what I use it for. I don&#x27;t think this was made for the under eye area at all. I have repurchased this concealer (medium) about 4 times. The tube last a little more than a year for me. A tiny bit goes a very long way. It matches my skin tone exactly. I have normal to dry skin. I can use only this on an everyday basis with a little bit of powder in the t-zone and blush &amp; be good to go. I love this concealer &amp; I hope it is never discontinued. 😊</li>
    <li> The name fits!  This was too hard for my skin!  It hurt to try to use it!</li>
    <li> Very small for the price, doesn&#x27;t cover up well either wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> i have two medium sized tattoos. the cover up was to greasy it came off within a matter of an hour. I tried to finish it with the matte powder but it still did nothing to cover my tattoos. horribly disappointed. It makes a great face cover up, but it should not advertise itself as a tattoo concealer.</li>
    <li> Very &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; make-up.  Leave lots of drying time in between layers.</li>
    <li> This concealer does not do as stated. It actually conceals nothing and it creases easily. I will not be using this or buying it again.</li>
    <li> Color was a tad lighter than I expected! Be forewarned, the colors run super light! I just mix it with a little bit of a darker foundation and it is AMAZING!  Such high coverage, can be used to cover tattoos or in your daily makeup routine!  A little goes a LONG way so this product will last me a while :)</li>
    <li> When I first used this, it came out runny and almost water-like? I had to squeeze out a good amount before the concealer actually started to look concealer-y. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the pencil, but so far, the concealer does a good job at hiding my blemishes and like other reviews said, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product each time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super picky. I really have tried almost every high end concealer looking for one that does a good cover-up without looking cakey. My favourite is Tarte&#x27;s Maracuja Creaseless Concealer (the one in the little tube), but it&#x27;s a bit too oily (it even separates in the tube). This concealer is less oily, the same coverage, same shade (as fairly light neutral... maybe Glamoflauge is a BIT lighter, but not much). It stays on for a good.. 4 hours (but NOTHING stays on my face longer.. I&#x27;m trying to be realistic). It fades a bit after that, and keeps light coverage for the remainer of 8-10 hours.</li>
    <li> Another typical &#x27;cover-up&#x27; that&#x27;s really just a typical thin makeup base. If your tattoo has thick outlining or dark colors, this will not do much for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a high coverage concealer! The consistency is like a paste. It&#x27;s definitely on the oily side. So, a setting powder is on top an absolute must! For normal to dry skin this works. For oily skin or if you sweat a lot, I would steer away from this one, as it will slide off quickly. It will provide coverage for about 3-4 hours, then it will start fading slowly. It&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This product made me very happy. I use it every time when I need to cover my dark circles around my eyes and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> This works well...I am very old and have very dark circles, so most concealers don&#x27;t work that well for me.  This is the best and least expensive one I have tried...will stick with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I have ever used before. a very little amount provides a great amount of coverage.</li>
    <li> So I got this to cover up a scar (not a deep scar so not something hard to cover up) on my stomach and if anything it just made it more noticeable.</li>
    <li> Best concealer I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been a very loyal MAC studio finish concealer in nc30 until I found this product. As a makeup junkie I&#x27;m always looking for good concealers that have good coverage (acne scars and dark circles) and yet look natural and don&#x27;t cake. I love the way it covers my scars but I will suggest a powder to prevent mild creasing in the undereye region. Other than that I absolutely love. I apply with a fluffy tapered brush because it is more precise and gives a more flawless finish. I finish off with a few spritz if setting spray or toner in a spritz bottle and it really looks very natural. If you want you can also use a beauty blender so that it looks more like skin. The key is to not use soo much because a little goes a very long way with this stuff!</li>
    <li> The pencil is good, but the concealer itself does nothing. It&#x27;s thick but sheer. Make sense? I didn&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Too soon to judge the product. - will see how things turn out in about a week&#x27;s use, so will see.</li>
    <li> On the back it tell you how you can cover the tattoo. I need it covered for a job. It is the worst product it just makes the tattoo lighter I still can clearly see it...</li>
    <li> This concealer is way overpriced here! You can get this exact at Walmart for $6.00....it covers decently, but I do not see how it could cover a tattoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d gotten a lot of recommendations for this product, so I decided to try it. Glad I did! Its coverage is very strong as it doesn&#x27;t spread around loosely like a lot of other liquid concealers. It stays on all day and is cheap! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this concealer a lot, it covers my dark circles that I have a huge problem with. Also, girl to girls here- they cover the hickeys your dad can&#x27;t see really well. I don&#x27;t recommend using this on blemishes though, it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for us girls that like full coverage.  It&#x27;s a liquid make-up, but it&#x27;s a lot thicker than one would think.  It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smear, and covers EVERTHING!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, i use it for a dramatic look after i foundation and powder, i put it on under my eyelids then again set with a powder for a kim kardashion look and its thin but covers very heavily so a little goes a long way! But at Walmart its only 6 bucks!</li>
    <li> This is a great concealer to hide darkness under my eyes. This will last long as well only need a little. A little drop goes a long way. I love this concealer!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, great coverage! Definitely recommend!!!! Be aware, a little goes a long way! Covers everything!!</li>
    <li> Works good. A little tacky like it doesn&#x27;t dry well enough and smears easy but I used to have to cover my tats at work and as long as nothing touched it, it covered it enough...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get what is the buzz about. I hated it. It has awesome coverage and it might be great for covering tattoo, but for daily use?.... no way. The shades it comes in are awful, not even one comes in real skin color, so when you put it on dark under eye you get bright yellow under eyes. You can set it with powder or apply foundation over it but you will end up looking like Halloween mask and that is not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a good heavy duty concealer. I would say it&#x27;s comparable to the Vichy/dermablend  brand at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Good coverage on acne and under-eye circles. Only the tiniest bit is needed, otherwise it starts to look pasty. I have pretty pale skin, but this is slightly too light on me. I think the medium would be too dark. It just takes a little extra blending.</li>
    <li> Omg! So over priced!!!</li>
    <li> I have tired every brand And this had great coverage and never oily</li>
    <li> Glamflauge covers really well and the little bottle last forever. Exactly what I was looking for. Picture and description was as I expected when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and suffer from hyper-pigmentation. A few weeks ago, I had one of the worst break outs in years which left me with lots of marks to cover. I have had issues with marks for eight years now, so I&#x27;ve tried many concealers. Most recently, dermablend, erase paste, and boing both by benefit. None of those concealers worked as well as this does. If you can find it in a Walmart near you, I suggest you do that because I got mine there for $6. The teeniest amount covers me entire face perfectly (which layers of foundation were never able to do.) I mean, smaller than a fourth of a pea size. A super tiny amount. It&#x27;s great and stays on all day. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> i ordered this becuase im covered in tattoos and when i go to job interviews i can cover them up with this,i havnt used it yet thought..but im hoping it really works</li>
    <li> Did not cover my tattoo. It did not work like I wanted it to at all. Need to find a different product</li>
    <li> Great coverage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with how this product covers! 😍</li>
    <li> This product shipped extremely fast and was at my door no less than 2 days after I ordered. It has pretty decent coverage, but is a bit oily at first. I would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> good concealer, but the smell is gross, not long lasting for oily skin</li>
    <li> its really good coverage but its very heavy and the colors are either so light or so dark. If they got a bigger more realistic color range i would definently repurchase.</li>
    <li> heavy concealer for cheap price, if you are looking for some major coverage at a reasonable price, this product is for you!</li>
    <li> It covers my tattoo very well. It makes it look very faded. I will likely buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I usually have pretty clear skin (and I&#x27;m very very fair) but when I get those baggy under-eyes, or I have a pimple or a scrape or anything I need covered up, I just use a spot of glamoflauge and blend it into the rest of my foundation and I look flawless. I used this once at a friends house, ordered my own immediately, and have been addicted ever since.</li>
    <li> Amazing. This stuff covers every dark spot,  scar,  blemish and any other thing you can think of! It&#x27;s very hard to cover my dark spots. This is thick and a lurks how&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I love makeup. When I heard about it I was amazed of the stories.  I have a few scars on my face and thought it would do the trick :/ well the concealer doesn&#x27;t last long :( it no matter what I do. But it does cover a bit tho, I wish it would last longer</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed.  The coverage is fantastic and it does not look like a mask.  It does not feel heavy on the skin, nor is it greasy.  It only takes a very small amount for full coverage</li>
    <li> This was my second, but probably last purchase of this product.  Need more devirsity in color for those of us of color.  Really did nothing to conceal except for normal skin discoloration.</li>
    <li> This is just what it says, a heavy duty concealer. I sometimes get cystic acne that becomes a dark purple color and this product covers it completely and stays on all day. I would definitely recommend it for covering hard to cover imperfections.</li>
    <li> This works amazing, I recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> TBH this concealer works fabulous on my skin. It does a perfect job. I use it to cover up my dark circle and let me say it works fanatics. It&#x27;s a heavy concealer BUT it doesn&#x27;t mean it will cover up the small tattoo you have there. So if you guys are looking for coverage on your tattoo, you are welcome to look for something else cause this concealer will only cover so much on your face!! Just saying... Other then that I usually buy it at Walmart. It&#x27;s still the same price.</li>
    <li> I have very light skin and I get a lot of purple color under my eyes. This concealer does have great coverage, and I loved it at first. However, I found that it creases horribly. It also dried out my skin a lot. It made me look really old and wrinkly, and I&#x27;m only 21! I do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> The best concealer I&#x27;ve ever had! Covers up almost everything, considering my bold scaring on the face. Would recommend to anybody! Although, the shipping was late by one day.</li>
    <li> We have an APO address because we are stationed overseas. The concealer arrived much sooner than expected. My daughter is very happy with the concealer. It is her absolute favorite of all that she&#x27;s tried (and that&#x27;s a lot). She uses it to cover up her freckles. It covers the freckles without looking like she spackeled the make up on.</li>
    <li> Does not work for tattoos at all I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone trying to cover up a tattoo.  Not even the smallest tattoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and covers age spots very well.  You only need a tiny tiny amount so one tube will last a year unless you have large areas to cover every day such as a large tatoo.  I do not use it underneath my eyes since it tends to sit in my fine wrinkles and make them look worse ,but for covering smooth imperfections it is amazing.</li>
    <li> My skin is not very reactive at all, not oily, minor blemishes... This product made me break out all over.</li>
    <li> Conceals very well, but a bit more bit oily than I prefer.  Also, if left in a stationary position for more than a day, the product tends to separate and you get oil all over your hands until you squeeze enough out of the tube to get to the well-mixed part.</li>
    <li> Bought this to cover a black and white tattoo I have behind my ear. It arived on time but the bottom of the tude has holes in it.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless I tried to see if the product would work after 4 layers of this stuff it wad finally covered but in the tattoos place was now a wad of caked on blob of foundation.</li>
    <li> This item is good to a certain extent  I&#x27;m sure good for small tattoo cover ups but really not for any bigger than your palm.</li>
    <li> This was the first concealer I&#x27;ve ever tried and I LOVE it! But be careful, a little goes a LONNGGGG way! If you apply too much, it WILL look cakey.</li>
    <li> This concealer is amazing! A little goes a long LONG way, so be careful. It can be a little cakey if not blended all of the way, but this is the best concealer I have ever found! Love Love Love it!</li>
    <li> catches in the lines under my eyes, even with just a little.  definitely covers...but I am finding that its too heavy for me</li>
    <li> the consistency is a bit too heavy and oily. It does great as a heavy concealer. It was just ok :p</li>
    <li> So I have very dark undereye circles and very deep set eyes, so the shadow makes the circles appear worse. I bought this stuff as it was recommended on a makeup forum.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to really love this stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly or easily. It appears cakey. I&#x27;m not sure if I just haven&#x27;t perfected the technique or not, but it doesn&#x27;t really work well for me. I&#x27;ll give it another shot soon, but maybe it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it everyday, it makes my skin look flawless. It last a 12 hour shift at work too. I highly reccomend it. I have oily skin &amp; I find that because this is thick and dry when rubbed in it really helps reduce shine.</li>
    <li> WOW works unbelievably!</li>
    <li> As someone who has suffered from dark, under-eye circles for most of her life, I&#x27;m glad to have found a product that help conceal them.  It&#x27;s not 100%, but it is definitely an improvement.</li>
    <li> product works pretty good, only problem is that it smears onto anything that touches it. but it does a good job concealing!</li>
    <li> This concealer  does  the job perfectly  and  it doesn&#x27;t  take much to completely  cover  whatever one needs on the face. I&#x27;ll  be using  this as long  as I live  and or the product  survives.  My youthful  granddaughters  use it is how I learned  about  it.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all to cover up my small tat2.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get the little pencil most of all. Actually haven&#x27;t even tried the concealer yet, but am so pissed! The pencil is REALLY dark! I ordered the light and this pencil is for VERY dark complexions. Grr. Who could use this combo? Someone who matches the pencil would be too dark to use the liquid. Maybe I got a messed up package? Idk.</li>
    <li> This is the first cover up I have found that&#x27;s light enought for my skin tone and covers the thick black tattoo I have on my wrist. I will definitely but this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cover wrist tattoo. It isn&#x27;t thick enough or something...</li>
    <li> Works great as my highlight!</li>
    <li> I have some scars on my arm, I like this better than the Dermablend. I apply matte powder over it.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product as I&#x27;ve been searching for something to cover my dark under-eye circles.  It&#x27;s ok, the color is off and was a bit light for my fair skin.  I feel like it&#x27;s no different from any other concealer.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This was the first tattoo cover-up I ever purchased, and I&#x27;m not a heavy make-up wearer, so let me share my observations on using the product and end results. I bought this for the sole purpose of covering ankle tattoos for a business trip, with the intent to wear nylons. For that purpose it worked absolutely fine. I think that without the nylons it would not have looked natural at all.&lt;br /&gt;A few notes on usage:&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that you will need to keep a pencil sharpener handy for the color pencil, as it doesn&#x27;t come with one.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to go around the outlie of your tat with the color pencil, but i just colored over the whole thing before applying the actual concealer.&lt;br /&gt;You will need to have some powder at hand to go over the concealer after you put it on and blend it in. This helps set the concealer.&lt;br /&gt; Be aware that a little does go a long way with the concealer. The Light color is really the color of Silly Putty - again, not a big concern for me since i was wearing nylons, but I think if you were not wearing nylons it would not look natural enough.  Those more skillful with make-up application may have ways to blend it in and make it look more like their own skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;For my purposes, it worked well enough that I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice consisntency , use only small amount, too light mixed with darker concealer, covered , and lasted all day once it was set with powder!</li>
    <li> i have owned this concealer before and i love it i just so came a crost it on here and i have to say that you can buy this for SIX DOLLARS this is a rip off.[...]</li>
    <li> I loved this, but I hate the smell of it. It goes away but when you first put it on, it&#x27;s pretty bad.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cover tattoos. Overall it works well, but starts to rub off throughout the day, even with setting powder or spray.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Very pigmented and does the trick</li>
    <li> Sorry for the awkward wording in the title.&lt;br /&gt;This concealer is great for under eye circles, blemishes, discolorations, anything. The pencil, while I lost it somehow and never used it, is most likely good for precise work under brows, on specific spots, and cupid&#x27;s bows.&lt;br /&gt;However, even with primer, powder, and fixing spray, the concealer still fades like none of those factors were applied. I don&#x27;t touch my face any more than the next person, so maybe it could do with oil production or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, a very good concealer to start out with.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> A few months ago I experienced the worst breakout I had ever had due to a product I was using. When that awful break-out left me with red hyperpigmentation I turned to this product. Let me just say...WOW. Talk about FULL COVERAGE! I&#x27;ve heard many people compare it to Kat Von D&#x27;s tattoo concealer. Everyone is right when they say a little goes a LONG way..which is why I feel like it will take me many more months before I run out. I don&#x27;t find much use in the pencil that comes with it, but that&#x27;s okay. Something that stood out was that many other concealers will have to be layered thickly to even compare to the coverage of this one. However, with this concealer I can actually blend the product so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey, but yet I&#x27;m able to get the coverage I need. My only complaint is that the shade&#x27;light&#x27; is really really light, surprisingly light. So the next time I might opt for a darker shade. Oh, and if you have dry skin you should be sure to moisturize well because this product can look cakey over dry skin.</li>
    <li> I first saw this concealer on a popular makeup guru&#x27;s Youtube channel. She provides very well-made reviews, testing out all sorts of high-end and low-end products for women of all incomes. I&#x27;ve found quite a few new makeup faves thanks to her, so when she mentioned this $6 dollar concealer from Walmart, an alleged concealer that could cover tattoos completely, I thought, \\&quot;Yay! Finally!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To explain, I have naturally dark circles with a dark green/blue vein under one eye. And with a very light skin tone (around NC30-35, I think), any little darkness just takes over. I&#x27;ve tried ungodly amounts of drugstore concealers in the hopes that the dark circles could be covered. So when I heard about the Glamoflauge, I definitely wanted to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I had high hopes for this product and I was kinda disappointed. The color I got (Light) definitely perked up my undereye area, going along with the practice of creating the upside down triangle under the eyes and along the nose that so many makeup artists swear will cover up any dark circles and highlight that part of the face for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On it&#x27;s own, the product didn&#x27;t even fully cover the blue/green veins on my wrist (my after-purchase swatch spot). I get the whole \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot; part of the application, but not even layering really covered the veins. After a few layers, it just looked cakey and thick. I then tried application with a sponge, my (clean!) fingers, and a concealer brush. None of those ways truly covered up my dark circles. So, with the claim of a \\&quot;heavy duty concealer\\&quot;, I&#x27;m skeptical and let down. If my dark circles are darker than an actual tattoo, then either I have to see a cosmetic surgeon or this product just didn&#x27;t live up to its claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;ve tried to redeem this purchase. I now used it in combination with my foundation to better conceal the smaller imperfections and keep away the \\&quot;mask\\&quot; look. It works better this way as the concealer works more like a medium to full coverage foundation now that I&#x27;ve re-purposed it. But I have other concealers for my undereye area instead of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and by the way, the little concealer pencil isn&#x27;t worth the purchase on its own. The texture was too hard and unyielding, especially for any sensitive area like the eyes or the face. The pencil feels dried out and difficult to apply, far worse than even an eyeliner or browliner. I tossed it in drawer as soon as I tested it and never looked back.orks more like a medium to full coverage foundation now that I&#x27;ve re-purposed it.

    <li> I was looking for something to cover my tattoos for special events.  Well this was not what I should have bought.  It is the wrong color and it rubs off easily...let alone it doesn&#x27;t cover my tattoos at all.  It makes it look like I smeared make up on my skin and then left the house.  It does blend easily...  I have saved it and used it for under eye concealer.  It settles into fine lines.  I am disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;**To add to my review the seller refunded my money promptly.  Thank you for your help in this matter! Great seller!!</li>
    <li> Amazing coverage for the price!! I love it and my sisters been using this for awhile and she told me it takes a long time to run out so thats great news!</li>
    <li> It definitely covers; I&#x27;d recommend using it with a pore concealer as well otherwise it really jams into any pores or scars you might have.</li>
    <li> Heard this was going to work well as a tattoo cover up.  Lies!  I&#x27;m sure for average makeup uses this is great, just not for what I was hoping.</li>
    <li> It covers my flaws. This cover has a nice, creamy texture and stays put.</li>
    <li> this product is very pigmented. but it my opinion, it doesnt cover well because of its texture. its very thick and dry, so for me(I have very dry skin) it just looked cakey and u could see it accentuate my fine lines under the eyes. as for blemishes, it didnt look as bad, but i found it extremely hard to concentrate its pigmentation on one area, without having it look like an obvious spot on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so heres my gist:&lt;br /&gt;its very dry, so probably best used for people with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;its pigmented, but very thick.&lt;br /&gt;because of its thickness, its very hard to blend into ur skin.&lt;br /&gt;doesnt last without a powder or primer.</li>
    <li> I use this as a light inflammation concealer and it works fabulously for me. I don&#x27;t expect it to cover as heavily on my skin as my friends does because it is pretty hard to use a light concealer to conceal as much as one for a darker tone can. That being said it conceals what I need it to wonderfully. I don&#x27;t use it under my eyes like some because liquids tend to settle oddly on my eyes. But on the rest of my face (and a few other areas such as my neck/chest) it conceals my Rosatia and inflammation very well and helps me feel comfortable leaving the house. Also I have very sensitive skin and have never has a problem with it breaking me out or worsening inflammation.</li>
    <li> Looked very blotchy ponce on took a while to get it blended in</li>
    <li> I bought this as a tattoo concealer and is thick and covers the tattoo but it is so wet and sticky. It did not dry at all and I need a drier product.</li>
    <li> you can get it at your local drugstore for 8$ and I really recommend this its made for covering tattoos so its super thick and creamy</li>
    <li> Okay so I want to put to bed all the negative comments about this concealer. First off, I have terrible undereye circles, genetically they are seriously purple all the time. So for me, finding a good concealer is sooo important! I have struggled for years to find a good (inexpensive!!) one and now I finally found it! This concealer is wonderful. It covers up my dark circles like they never were there and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Now as for the complaints I see in the bad reviews, I know everyone is concerned with having the creases under your eye but I never have had a concealer that hasn&#x27;t done that over a certain period of time. This one does crease, I won&#x27;t lie, BUT I have found if you put undereye setting powder over it (I use E.l.f.) it works beautifully and doesn&#x27;t crease at all. So honestly I don&#x27;t get why anyone wouldn&#x27;t give this product the comments it deserves! It is awesome! I will tell you though, a little goes a LONG way!! And just because I wanna help a sister out, definitely get this product at Walmart for half the price!!!</li>
    <li> covers well. I ordered the wrong color but made it work still.</li>
    <li> It took A LOT of this product to cover my sister&#x27;s tattoo and came off on her clothes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Target and it was definitely not what I expected. The pencil is useless and it creases, so definitely do not use it under your eyes. It appears cakey because the formula is quite thick (ironic because its coverage is horrible). My skin is oily/combo so I guess that had an effect on my experience. I still regret ever purchasing this. This concealer absolutely cannot even come close to comparison with Kat Von D. Also, the price on here is wayyy too expensive compared to Target or Walmart.</li>
    <li> I like it so much, the consistence and the full cover is AMAZING</li>
    <li> I bought this product after watching several youtube videos on how to cover up tattoos. I still live at home, and my parents are very against having ink, so needless to say, they do not know about mine! It works amazing! 1 layer of this stuff and it&#x27;s almost completely covered. As others have said, a little does go a very long way, so I think this will last me a long time! I also got this way before I expected! I love this stuff, and just ordered one in the next shade up for summer!</li>
    <li> This product was separated. It seems like it is old. Oil with makeup clumps in side.</li>
    <li> Muy buen producto lo recomiendo ampliamente, va muy bien con mi tipo de piel y con lo que necesito, feliz con mi compra, lo volvere a comprar cuando lo necesite, gracias.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this concealer. A lot of people say the same with many products but isn&#x27;t true when it comes to my face. I have acne pigment scarring, dark circles and sun spots. I literally use a dab and it covers all of it on my cheek and more. It&#x27;s very full coverage. I like to mix it in with my primer and my foundation so it&#x27;s less noticeable. Meaning I have a hard time matching my skin tone and mixing it in with my foundation makes it look flawless and all over even skin tone. I would compare this to the Kat Von D. tattoo foundation sold at Sephora. Hard Candy is more affordable and works awesome!</li>
    <li> well.................it was about $2 cheaper at a local Wal-Mart store so that was upsetting, the concealer works really well, does not crease into my wrinkles and as an added bonus it does not smudge as my lower lashes touch . I have pretty long lower lashes and sometimes I get little black smudges from my usual concealers when my mascara ( any brand) touches my under eye area. This product dries well and does a great job, I will purchase it again and again. The little pencil seems like a waste of time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is THICK. A little definitely goes a long way. It&#x27;ll cover anything. The extra little stick of concealer, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m supposed to do with it. It&#x27;s very hard.</li>
    <li> This came to my house busted open and leaking! Not satisfied at all!</li>
    <li> I started buying this about a year ago, and I haven&#x27;t felt the need to shop around for a different product since then. I don&#x27;t use it on my dark circles though, as it does appear cakey. There is a well-defined line between where my eye area ends and my cheek begins, so it&#x27;s very hard to blend into that area. Plus if I do make the whole area one uniform color, it makes my eyes appear smaller. Does the product state it is meant for dark circles? I never thought so.  It applies pretty oily/moist, but if I let it sit for a bit and then apply powder, it stays put.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin which is also sensitive. Always on the lookout for something to cover up stubborn breakouts and dark under eye circles. I had high hopes since so many people love this stuff. I can see why it would work for some people: It does have great coverage, which is buildable and blendable. I found that it had to be blended quickly or it ended up a bit of a streaky mess. My main complaints were that it looked amazing when first applied but wore off quickly. This is a common make up woe for me, as most make up melts off of my face by midday. (Except Revlon colorstay.) Also, it is NOT non-comedogenic (I should have checked this before purchase). It did cause a minor breakout for me even though I only used it for about 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for me it was a disappointment. However, if you do not have oily acne prone skin this may work well for you.</li>
    <li> Comes off very easily</li>
    <li> The coverage for me was fantastic. It made a large blemish on my face virtually disappear. However, I now have rashes on the tops of both of my cheeks from it. I have never had an irritation from any makeup before...</li>
    <li> Great coverage. You only need a small amount :) I&#x27;ve tried lots of concealers and for the price this is definitely one of the best. It does crease quite a bit though. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Did not cover my wife&#x27;s tattoo even after using the pencil first and 3 coats of the concealer</li>
    <li> The color turned out to be a little light for my complexion, but I use it underneath my foundation, so it  looks fine.  I wish the pencil was bigger.</li>
    <li> This product offers very good coverage. The only draw back is that it wears off over s period of time so touch ups are required. The bleed through is minimal on tattoo&#x27;s so unless someone looks very closely your not going to see it.</li>
</ol>
