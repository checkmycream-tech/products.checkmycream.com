      <li>It&#x27;s worth it just for the fact that it conditions the lashes and keeps them from breaking.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using the serum for a little over 6 months now and my eye lashes seem a little longer than before.  You need to apply it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night daily.  You don&#x27;t see the result right away but it comes slowly if you stick to it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seeing any results</li>
    <li> Want long eyelashes but don&#x27;t want to spend $50?  This serum did as good a job as the more expensive ones - I know, I&#x27;ve tried them.  I went from a more expensive brand that worked great to this one, waiting to see if my eyelashes went back to normal.  Nope, my eyelashes are still nice and long.  Another plus is that the serum didn&#x27;t bother my eyes</li>
    <li> I loved it. It took like a month or two to finally see results but they were worth the wait</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I found this Serum last year, vacationing in Nevada, in one of those dollar-type stores for about two dollars.  It took me a while to notice how great it made my eyelashes look because I never used it consistently.  My eyelashes seemed longer and darker.  It took a very long time to run out and when it did, I decided I wanted to keep my eyelashes looking as good as this seem to make them look, I bought it here because I couldn&#x27;t begin to think where I would be able to find it again now that I&#x27;m back in my home state.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Amazing, It Really Works But Give it Some Time To Work About A Week Or Two. Worth the price👌</li>
    <li> You start seeing results in about two weeks. My lashes were actually longer and healthier. I apply it every night and sometimes 10mins (to give it a chance to dry) before I apply my mascara over it.</li>
    <li> I have only started using this within the past 3 days, but I can see a big difference in how easily my mascara goes on.  I am so hopeful I will see lash growth.  I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks.  It&#x27;s worth it just for the fact that it conditions the lashes and keeps them from breaking.  I have had no irritation whatsoever from this.  I tried two other big name lash enhancers (Rapid Lash and Lilash) that made my eyes burn quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my lashes being longer or fuller&lt;br /&gt;but I did like how they make my lashes look a little glossy but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I used this product everyday after my shower for about 3 weeks, I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all.</li>
    <li> PLEASE READ THIS FIRST!&lt;br /&gt;First, my personal product experience: This stuff feels great on my lashes, I used it as directed, (lash only), for two weeks and my lashes seemed healthier and very soft but I didn&#x27;t see much of a change. It only made sense to me that if I wanted to feed my lashes that they needed some help at the root as well. So I applied it to my lash line, (with a Q-tip or small paint/makeup brush) and began using it both on the lash and lash line. Wouldn&#x27;t you know it, I started seeing a real change in growth.&lt;br /&gt;WHY IS THIS A BETTER PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;1. THE PRICE!&lt;br /&gt;2. The ingredients are not unsafe for your eyes. I personally did a lot of research into almost 50 serums and this is what I found. Select Lash eyelash serum&#x27;s ingredients are simply a nourishing compound which in turn stimulates healthy new growth. Big name lash serums are very controversial right now in the U.S. due to unsafe ingredients being used and so many even more unsafe counterfeits being made. Some even effect your eye sight permanently.&lt;br /&gt;3. The claims are straight up. There are no false promises here, if you use this it will make your lashes healthier and in turn they will grow a lot faster, fuller, and longer. If a product claims to make you lashes thicker, (RED FLAG), that&#x27;s a lie. Lashes, individually cannot be made thicker. They can only be made fuller by stimulating new growth, (more lash strands).&lt;br /&gt;4. It comes with not only a guarantee, but it comes in pairs. It&#x27;s convenient to take one in my bag or car, and leave one in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS REMEMBER...IF A DEAL SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, (huge discounts on big names, outlandish claims, incorrect spelling and grammar), IT&#x27;S BECAUSE IT IS.&lt;br /&gt;FYI...Legit, regulated, and honest companies can SELL their product in the U.S.A.&lt;br /&gt;DANGEROUS &amp; DISHONEST suppliers and companies CANNOT SELL, but rather they can only SHIP to the U.S.A.&lt;br /&gt;FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good &amp; honest products &amp; suppliers are getting harder to come by, so when you find one, be sure to let EVERYONE know and then, let them know you appreciate them &amp; the Great job they do. GREAT JOB! Happy holidays to all!ucts &amp; suppliers are getting harder to come by, so when you find one, be sure to let EVERYONE know and then, let them know you appreciate them &amp; the Great job they do. GREAT JOB! Happy holidays to all!</li>
    <li> this crap didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> it works but it doesnt really give you volume.</li>
    <li> Saw significant growth (: and I love that it comes with 2! Great deal! Will last me a long time</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend! Came in the mail even before the set date. Its easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. The only disappointment I have is that one bottle was only half full when I received it, which really sucks. Other than that its great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I honestly don&#x27;t see a difference and I have a small spot where I need some lashes to grow so this isn&#x27;t too great for my eyelashes. I am not complaining though too much because it was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> the next morning a saw a slight difference. It&#x27;s been about a week now and I have about half a centemeter of growth.</li>
    <li> i really like this stuff! second time i order. i put it twice a day and i see improvement on my eyelashes!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t lengthen my eyelashes. However, 2 stars because it makes for a good eyebrow tamer!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I see a significant change in just 2 weeks! Will recommend to friends.</li>
