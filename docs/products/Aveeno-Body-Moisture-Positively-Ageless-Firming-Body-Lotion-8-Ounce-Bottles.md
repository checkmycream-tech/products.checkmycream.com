      <li>but, I do love how my skin feels when I use it.</li>
      <li>Used it all up and fell in love with the product.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>As for the firming part...need some more time to prove it...</li>
      <li>It initially smelled pleasant in the bottle but after about 20 minutes I found myself checking around for the source of a foul smell before realizing it was me!!</li>
      <li>My dermatologist says that my skin is astonishing for someone my age (70) and I credit Aveeno lotions which I have used for years.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of shiitake mushrooms.  </li>
      <li>So soft, smooth, moisturized, and looks great!!!  </li>
      <li>&quot; \\&quot;Your skin is soft\\&quot; and more.</li>
      <li>I got a free trial size sample of this lotion and fell in love...</li>
      <li>It has a nice light scent (maybe a bit too sweet for me).</li>
      <li>it just smells clean and sophisticated.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that it costs more than I like to pay for a lotion, but I am so happy with the results that I&#x27;ll continue to buy.  </li>
      <li>Way, way, too strong.  </li>
      <li>but it is to strong.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling nice and hydrated after a really hot bath.</li>
      <li>It does what it promises -- erases fine lines.</li>
      <li>It said it was lightly scented, but was overbearing.  </li>
      <li>It kept my itching skin silky smooth</li>
      <li>The cream just glides on and it makes your skin really smooth.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy using Aveeno products.</li>
      <li>I found out about it by googling best moisturizer to firm skin.</li>
      <li>Nothing is a miracle; however, this product is a good product and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have been using this lotion for four years and it really makes my skin beautiful and young.</li>
      <li>but i can say my skin is super soft since first use and it smells so beautiful not overpowering</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure some people are more sensitive to it than others, so for some people it might be fine.  </li>
      <li>It feels greasy too, hence a significant level of discomfort after putting it on.</li>
      <li>I have not tried the higher end products, but I doubt they are much better.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a good lotion to use.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>It is just turning cool</li>
      <li>She is a nurse and knows something of these type of products that actually do some good for your body.</li>
      <li>I just bought this (not from Amazon), and as some others have noted, it has a pretty strong perfume smell.  </li>
      <li>But for a light filler and firmer, used daily, this works magic!</li>
      <li>stores and drugstores sell out quickly.  </li>
      <li>I like how it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
      <li>And it worked quickly.</li>
      <li>In particular, I love this body moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It has a limited firming effect, kind of like Jergens, tho that is also available with light tanning.</li>
      <li>Granted, it is not the cheapest in price, but worth every penny of it.  </li>
      <li>was in my mid 40s when I started using this product and compared to other brands, I think this is the best.  </li>
      <li>I also believe it&#x27;s due to good eating habits...</li>
      <li>I love Aveeno products but this scent is a little overwhelming for me...</li>
      <li>My skin looks so much better and more firm in the buttock/thigh region.  </li>
      <li>Trying this product for the first time.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Aveeno Body Moisture Positively Ageless Firming Body Lotion, 8-Ounce Bottle</li>
      <li>Saw a slight improvement (let&#x27;s be honest, nothing will eliminate cellulite).</li>
      <li>The scent was strong enough that I&#x27;m returning it for that reason.  </li>
      <li>But for me, it&#x27;s strong enough that I really don&#x27;t want to use it, even if it works well.  </li>
      <li>I expected much better result from this product, considering its price and reputation.</li>
      <li>I never would have thought a lotion could make this much of a difference.  </li>
      <li>It really firms and gives the skin a nicer appearance.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t know what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>I really feel the loss of that product.</li>
      <li>know how well i can say it firms as much as i think that it helps you KEEP the degree of firmness that your skin already has.</li>
      <li>The lotion is really watery and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG WITH AVEENO PRODUCTS. THIS IS A GOOD DEAL AND IT ARRIVED IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. GREAT SCENT NOT TOO PERFUMEY...LOOKING FORWARD TO USING IT AND WILL PROBABLY ORDER MORE.  IT&#x27;S GREAT TO FEEL LIKE YOU&#x27;RE PAMPERING YOUR SKIN WITH THE BEST PRODUCTS AND NOT TOO GOSH AWFULLY EXPENSIVE.  GREAT VALUE. SAVED A FEW PENNIES ORDERING ONLINE THAN PURCHASING IN THE STORE.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with all of the Aveeno products over the past year.  In particular, I love this body moisturizer.  Granted, it is not the cheapest in price, but worth every penny of it.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes to moisture their entire body, as I do.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. It does what it promises -- erases fine lines. I&#x27;m not sure about spots; I still have those. But for a light filler and firmer, used daily, this works magic!</li>
    <li> Box was fine, but when I opened the box, it was crushed on the inside...</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good firming lotion, save your money. I have been slathering it on for almost 2 months with no noticeable results. Great moisturizer, though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for about 2 weeks now and I have noticed that my skin looks visibly smoother and firmer, and is so silky soft to the touch.  I will never use any other lotion again.  The difference is dramatic enough that my husband even noticed and commented on how soft smooth and supple my skin feels!!</li>
    <li> I tried this because it was on sale and I will buy it again. It has a limited firming effect, kind of like Jergens, tho that is also available with light tanning. I like the scent better than Jergens&#x27;, tho it is not really a \\&quot;light\\&quot; scent. It&#x27;s noticeable, but as far as these firming moisturizers go, this is my favorite scent, perfumey and not the least bit medicinal. For the firming part, none of them that I have tried will do away with flab. They firm up the skin tone a little and will soften and reduce the look of cellulite, e.g., or tiny wrinkles from dryness or age. I have not tried the higher end products, but I doubt they are much better. This one worked fairly quickly, only a few days to see results, so that was nice, too. Good product.</li>
    <li> Nothing is a miracle; however, this product is a good product and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product was horrible.  Way, way, too strong.  It said it was lightly scented, but was overbearing.  I use Aveeno lotions and creams often and this is not typical.  The lotion also felt greasy on my hands.  It took a while to soak in.  I did not like the wait time.</li>
    <li> This body lotion is great!!! The effect of moisture works as expected. As for the firming part...need some more time to prove it...</li>
    <li> I enjoy using Aveeno products. This lotion truly feels great all over.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion each day at least twice a day (in morning and after i shower) and sometimes just to moisturize my hands. It feels nice on my skin and i usually use it with a few drops of Vit E oil and cocoa butter. I use it mostly on my face and areas with stretch marks (have 2 kids :-).  I am turning 30 and people always tell me a don&#x27;t look a day over 19 or 20! I believe the combination of products I use on a Daily basis has reduced the stretch marks and other marks i have. I also believe it&#x27;s due to good eating habits...plenty of water and using products like this one. I have it on automatic order and just received my 2nd one a couple days back. Good product.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno products but this scent is a little overwhelming for me...but, I do love how my skin feels when I use it. As for the firming claim? Hmmm, don&#x27;t expect miracles people. Let&#x27;s be real, diet and exercise must be included into your daily regimen as well. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again though just cause the scent is far too much.</li>
    <li> This was a much better deal than local stores, and the same quality. Aveeno has never caused any skin issues and I have a lot of sensitivities.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for four years and it really makes my skin beautiful and young. I wish they would come up with a big bottle coz I always run out of it and since I am based in Manila and have siblings in the States, I end up pestering them to send me a pack of four always.&lt;br /&gt;I was in my mid 40s when I started using this product and compared to other brands, I think this is the best.  I love the smell of shiitake mushrooms.  No icky feeling after using it and it smells good.  I&#x27;ve also tried their aveeno moisturizing cream at night and their facial washes and scrubs as well.  I cannot complain.</li>
    <li> Good but not great....Aveeno Body Moisture Positively Ageless Firming Body Lotion, 8-Ounce Bottle.....It&#x27;s not heavy scented which I like...not to greasy either!~</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. Great product, at a Great price.</li>
    <li> Works as described - love it!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist says that my skin is astonishing for someone my age (70) and I credit Aveeno lotions which I have used for years. Aveeno Firming is the best so far.</li>
    <li> No visible results after 2 months of daily use. It is a great lotion but there are no visible results</li>
    <li> I expected much better result from this product, considering its price and reputation. I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I used it constantly for a few months, and I can&#x27;t say that there was any improvement in my skin appearance. The lotion is very heavy and dense, which makes it more like a cream. It feels greasy too, hence a significant level of discomfort after putting it on. I will not buy again. Way too overpriced.</li>
    <li> The cream just glides on and it makes your skin really smooth.  I really love it!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my oldest daughter because it is what she likes. She is a nurse and knows something of these type of products that actually do some good for your body. She uses this a lot and is very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 9 months now.  I don&#x27;t believe it does any firming, but is a wonderful moisturizer.  I buy almost everything from Amazon, but cannot possible agree to pay $16.91 for a single 8 oz package of this cream, when it sells at $7.99 in your local drugstore!</li>
    <li> I just bought this (not from Amazon), and as some others have noted, it has a pretty strong perfume smell.  The scent was strong enough that I&#x27;m returning it for that reason.  I&#x27;m sure some people are more sensitive to it than others, so for some people it might be fine.  But for me, it&#x27;s strong enough that I really don&#x27;t want to use it, even if it works well.  I&#x27;ll be trying something else.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, meets its expectations.</li>
    <li> Trying this product for the first time.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well without leaving a sticky feeling but the scent is not that pleasant (not offensive or anything, but not my favorite).</li>
    <li> i havent use it long enough but i can say my skin is super soft since first use and it smells so beautiful not overpowering</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this lotion! It really firms and gives the skin a nicer appearance. I don&#x27;t mind the scent I think it&#x27;s very nice and the lotion itself is hydrating yet not heavy or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> It works. Try it and you will love it!  I have been using it for about two years now find amazing result.  Always people say \\&quot;look young\\&quot; \\&quot;Your skin is soft\\&quot; and more.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on nice, without greasy residue. It has a nice light scent (maybe a bit too sweet for me). The feel of moisture lasts a long time. My dryness has improved. I even use a little bit on my face.I have not experienced any &amp;#34;kind of firming of the skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;However:&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This moisturiser is great - after about a week I noticed improvement in my skin which was really dry. I like how it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. This value bundle of two makes this item slightly cheaper than what I was able to get at my local Walmart and Target.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good lotion to use.&lt;br /&gt;Does not contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is of the non-greasy variety and dried quite quickly on the skin, so if you don&#x27;t like the feeling of having greasy lotion on your skin this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this also means that in certain (very dry, cold) climate you might feel that the lotion is not enough, and may feel the need to reapply a couple times throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Nice creamy lotion, but didn&#x27;t notice a difference with any firming.</li>
    <li> I do love the smell but I have no clue what it is!!!! I is not flowery, it&#x27;s not citrusy......it just smells clean and sophisticated. The smell is not over powering either. People who say that must have bloodhound noses. This product is also not greasy either. Leaves your skin feeling nice and hydrated after a really hot bath. I use this in addition to Cerve.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and the way it leaves my skin, but it has SLS in it.</li>
    <li> I like the scent but it is to strong. The lotion is really watery and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin. Going to buy another lotion.</li>
    <li> Be patient and give it some. You will see results.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love love love this body lotion! It&#x27;s very hard to find....stores and drugstores sell out quickly.  I like it because it relieves dry skin and the name alone makes a 40+ feel as though they&#x27;re defying time. I&#x27;ve enlisted in reoccurring shipments....so convenient. I would definitely recommend the lotion AND the reoccurring shipments to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am only giving it 4 stars because I just starting using it.  It feels really good and  looks good on me.  By that I mean I do not shine of oil or grease and  my skin feels soft not sticky.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t firm I will probably continue to use it.</li>
    <li> well, I love Aveeno and this was a good deal.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion almost everyday and it does firm your skin after you use it for a while or at least I noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old and of normal/healthy weight (5&#x27;5\\&quot;, 130 pounds) and work out regularly.  Nonetheless I have been  getting some dimpling in my thighs/buttocks region over the last 5-6 years.  After 5 months of using this daily the amount of dimpling has reduced by at least 50%.  My skin looks so much better and more firm in the buttock/thigh region.  I never would have thought a lotion could make this much of a difference.  It&#x27;s also a good moisturizer for the rest of my body, and I figure I may as well use it everywhere to prevent any decline in the areas that still look youthful.  The only downside is that it costs more than I like to pay for a lotion, but I am so happy with the results that I&#x27;ll continue to buy.  I am indifferent to the scent and I don&#x27;t notice it 30 minutes after application.</li>
    <li> smells great and non greasy</li>
    <li> I have incredibly dry patches on my face since giving birth to my son 3 years ago.  I got a free trial size sample of this lotion and fell in love...my face has never felt better!  So soft, smooth, moisturized, and looks great!!!  Started using it on my feet and they are 10 times better than they used to be...I would pay ANY price for this lotion!!</li>
    <li> Why, oh why do companies change a good thing?  This is a nice thick lotion, but it does not take the place of the lotion of the same name, now discontinued.  The old formula was not as thick and came in a larger plunger bottle.  The old one had soy and oatmeal and this one has mushroom and wheat extract and dimethicone.  I used the old one as soon as I finished my shower and applied it liberally all over my body, while it was still damp.  It kept my itching skin silky smooth and I didn&#x27;t scratch all winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is too thick to use this way.  My skin feels slightly greasy instead of soft, so I try to use as little as possible.  It is just turning cool and I already have an itchy patch.  I think the oatmeal formula was best for relieving that problem. I really feel the loss of that product.</li>
    <li> Definitely works! And it worked quickly. I found out about it by googling best moisturizer to firm skin. it was one of five on that list and the only one that worked for my skin. Next I&#x27;m trying their eye firming cream.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product when Aveeno had marketed the dual pack with the moisturizing cream. Used it all up and fell in love with the product. Could no longer find it any of the local pharmacy stores and voila! Amazon you came through again.  I do feel it &#x27;masks&#x27; the appearance of slightly dimpled skin; definitely keeps your skin moisturized all day. Started off simply using it on the cellulite twice a day. Saw a slight improvement (let&#x27;s be honest, nothing will eliminate cellulite). Now I also use it on my face. No improvement there but I really don&#x27;t know what I was hoping for. Great product. Will definitely purchase on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> every single time i get out of the shower i grab this, mix it with a dot of self tanner and a dot of creamy vaseline.  use all over and i NEVER have dry skin and i don&#x27;t smell like a fake garden or basket of plastic fruit just exploded on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know how well i can say it firms as much as i think that it helps you KEEP the degree of firmness that your skin already has.</li>
    <li> I noticed that several previous reviews mentioned the smell, but figured I would try it anyway as scent preference is so subjective. It initially smelled pleasant in the bottle but after about 20 minutes I found myself checking around for the source of a foul smell before realizing it was me!! I&#x27;m not sure if its the mushroom extract or what but I found it unbearable and am now stuck with two tubes. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t testify to its firming qualities as I didn&#x27;t get to use it more than once. So, definitely try a sample before buying in bulk!</li>
