<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have flaky skin on my face. I was wondering if this might help it. I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference after the first use. I will keep using it and maybe I will see some results over time. I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference in my skin of the way it look.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I tried the facial and my skin is soft and glowing. I got an email with recipes that I can&#x27;t wait to try out. Great product and a great price!</li>
    <li> Great quality, the scoop is a nice perk.  The recipe book has some really helpful recipes.</li>
    <li> The possibilities for use of this product are endless and I was very impressed with how fine the power was. I&#x27;ve been really into taking detox baths lately and had heard about Indian Healing Clay. Taking a bath with this stuff was the most relaxing and soothing experience. Will definitely be using this regularly.</li>
    <li> My skin felt softer after just one use and I love that the product is all natural. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it left my face smooth . I think i mixed a little to much in the bowl other than that it stayed on well. I let it dry and noticed that it tightened up my skin a little bit more than i expected but other than that i am satified.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  I know exactly what I am putting on my face as I control the ingredients.  Using primarily as face mask for now, but apparently there are other applications.  A little bit goes a long way, expect this to last awhile.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. 1- recipe for the face mask was enough for my face, neck, shoulders, and part of my back. 2-My skin feels soft and bright...very bright. 3- no smelly stuff at all!!!4- love the free e-books too. Planing on buying more products</li>
    <li> I have tried the product on Wednesday, when I received it, and today. I like it, because it isn&#x27;t harsh, like I thought it would be. It is really soft rubbing on and off my face and it&#x27;s not hard to clean off, with a warm cloth. But, because of my sensitive skin, it makes my face tingle really quick. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like; is it didn&#x27;t say how often to use it, and clumps up really quick, which makes it&#x27;s a little difficult to mix if it isn&#x27;t enough water added to it. It can also be used in a bath, so I will try it that way next.</li>
    <li> Loved the way this makes my skin feel and look</li>
    <li> After using product face was soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I used it tonight for the first time. I used one scoop clay to 3 scoops of water made a paste and put the mask on facial.  Really like the way my face feels, it was a little dry so I did moisturized.  Need better directions on how often to use, how thick to put on especially if a new customer first time ever to put on mask.  As of right now I like the way my face feels and will try to maybe twice a week.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use for detoxing. My nutritionist recommended to use bentonite clay with Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar on my face as a mask. After purchasing this, I also received the free e-book they have for recipes and ideas on how to use the product. They also recommended to use the clay with ACV. I did this last night and my face really did pulsate as they say. It may be a little uncomfortable at first and your face gets rock hard, but the results are amazing! Why get a facial when you can do it yourself?! My face looks youthful and feels so soft.</li>
    <li> I love this! Definitely makes your face not oily and gives you a fresh feeling!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both tried the Indian Healing Clay as a mask for about 20 minutes. My skin is not problematic at all, but my husband has some acne and oil issues. The mask made my face feeling a little dry and tight, but my husband&#x27;s face was definitely softer and clearer after using it. I&#x27;m not sure if this was just my packaging, but there was no scoop in my jar, so that was a little disappointing. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade toothpaste and deodorant.  I have used other recipes but love the ones I found that use the bentonite clay.  La Lune Naturals is the first I have bought and will be the only.  I love the fast service and the free ebooks.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> My face feels so smooth after I use it.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped quickly and was exactly what it said! Loved the free ebooks that came with purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...a little messy to mix...but the feel as it glides on and the softness as you wash it off is heavenly!  I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t burn or dry my skin!  And most importantly. ..I did not experience any breakouts...yea!</li>
    <li> Love the different recipes that came with the purchase. Have used it once and can already tell my face feels smoother and is not as shiny.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my wife who is obsessed about skin care! Arrived on time, nice packaging and quite easy to use. She placed it in her bath as well as directly on her skin and reported that it was definitely one she will continue to use. She has tried other clay products and they never made it past the first use so a positive sign for sure. I am sure it will take time to really appreciate the value of the product physically, but I feel her response makes this a product that others could feel comfortable investing in (especially around this time of year).</li>
    <li> Great product for naturals.</li>
    <li> I have never done a facial before.  It was easy to use and it felt good when I was done.  I like that there was other treatments I could look up on line and try.</li>
    <li> So much fun! I&#x27;ve been doing facial masks worth my girlfriend&#x27;s and we have a blast! They also sent me a bunch of recipes I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
    <li> The product has been great.  Was a wonderful for a facial, and  I have sensitive skin - and had no problems.  Will order again.  (Plus received a coupon on my next order.)</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly! I&#x27;ve used the mask twice and feel like I&#x27;m already seeing results.</li>
    <li> I use it as a face mask and I like it- skin is smooth and clean</li>
    <li> I use it for detox baths and have the most relaxing and soothing experience.. I plan to try  this product for mercury detoxification</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading so many wonderful reviews. I like the fact that there is no odor or fragrance to it, but the experience of it all was really unpleasant for me. Mixing it was easy enough but putting it on my face felt like I was applying sticky glue. I thought that maybe I did not add enough water, so I added a little more. It went on smoothly, but as it began to dry, I actually started to feel a burning sensation. My skin was pulled tighter and tighter the drier it got (uncomfortably tight) and the burning feeling got more intense. I left it on for the entire time and it wasn&#x27;t really that easy to get off. It took me a while to wipe my face down with a wash cloth and the clay actually clogged my sink!&lt;br /&gt;My face was a little tender after using this mask, a bit red in areas but not too much, but it didn&#x27;t feel good. I honestly don&#x27;t think I will be giving this a second chance. I will probably give the jar away to someone else who might want to try it and tell them &amp;#34;good luck!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Amazing cleanser leaves skin feeling  soft</li>
    <li> Received on time.  Blended well with my muds (amla, hibiscus, and shikakai). I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This may be a bit far out for some people, but I put equal amounts of Organic Bentonite Clay Powder and Baking Soda in a dry bowl VitaMix for a few seconds to make a fine tooth powder. Then I put a small amount of organic coconut oil on a Sonicare tooth brush, dip it in the powder mix for a small amount. It does a great job. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend brushing too long. I find it does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to EVERYONE. It leaves your skin feeling so fresh and clean, and it looks so clear the next day. My pores have even shrunk after one useage! I would definitely try this if you have oily, or problem skin. Or just for anyone! I&#x27;d even pay double for it. That&#x27;s how much I love it</li>
    <li> I purchased La Lune Bentonite Clay for using in my skin care/cosmetic products - both for myself, family and to sell. I&#x27;ve been extraordinarily pleased with the quality. I use it in deodorant, in my loose face powder, powdered facial cleanser, and even in my homemade mascara. I thought the price was great for a quality product made in the USA. Will be ordering again! ------------------------------------ 11/10/15 Update Just ordered another jar. Using it in my face cleanser powder and deodorant cream are definitely my favorite uses. After doing a little digging, I found that Sodium Bentonite Clay is more absorbent than Calcium Bentonite Clay - which makes it GREAT for topical applications, and is the reason why this is NOT an internal clay. It was absorb TOO MUCH. Another popular brand that some people I know use is a calcium bentonite clay, which isn&#x27;t bad... just won&#x27;t add as much absorption to your deodorants as a sodium clay will. Thanks for the great product La Lune!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product. The seller sent and email on different recipes to try and this clay makes my skin feel soft and silky. My skin feels so refreshed and healthy.  I will add this to my favorite list of products to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  The packaging is simple, yet elegant.  Very fine powder.  Easy to mix.  Came with a useful little recipe  book.  Felt great and refreshing on the skin.  Worked just as described.  I made a mask for my skin.  I have sensitive skin, so just left mask on for 15 minutes, as suggested.  I mixed in a little honey, applied to my skin and let it work it&#x27;s magic.  I was very pleased with the results.  My skin felt cleaner, more smooth.  I can&#x27;t wait to slather the bottom of my feet and try the hair mask.  This is a very versitile product.  I love it!  I am considering ordering some and making DIY for Christmas Gifts for the ladies in my family.</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Wow does this product work quickly! In about 5 min on my face this clay was dramatically tightening my face. I definitely felt like I was at a spa using this product. It comes as dry clay and you mix with water to Fort a paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that my skin was pretty red after removal and even a day later.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! We use this to make toothpaste and it surprisingly doesn&#x27;t have a terrible taste or oder. Will definitely be buying this stuff again soon.</li>
    <li> I love this clay. I mixed it half and half with apple cider vinegar and used it as a facial mask, it feels amazing. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Well packaged, arrived promptly.  The mask recipes I received were very nice, and I have my first batch of tooth powder already made.</li>
    <li> This product is great just like the spa!</li>
    <li> Treat yourself to a spa day!!!!!</li>
    <li> Used it in a face mask yesterday and loved it!  Felt like I was having a face lift!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, use it every morning in smoothie! This brand is phenomenal!! You can trust them, &amp; all of the products they offer!!</li>
    <li> I have long heard of the benefits of the Indian Healing Clay, so I decided to purchase it and see for myself.  The ebook of recipes is wonderful.  When I first received the product I used it as a facial mask.  It was easy to mix and apply and very easy to wash off.  I was immediately struck with how soft my skin felt.  I appeared clearer and firmer.  I am looking forward to mixing up some of the other recipes and trying them too.  I have ordered several products from La Lune Naturals and am never disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Use it as a face mask and also as hair treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for all sorts of concoctions: deoderant mixes, foot treatments, hair mask...boy, this will start a detox reaction if you need one.  I occasionally get a spring rash, though I haven&#x27;t had one in a couple years.  This brought one on after body wrap #4-I wasn&#x27;t surprised, and was undaunted.  I treated the rash with CPTG melaleuca and lavender daily for a week, did another wrap (I use dilluted EOils and seaweed), and it cleared up.  It&#x27;s the fastest I have ever delt with a spring flare up, it can often take over a month. Interesting, and bonus, my skin looks great and feels smooth.  I feel like I&#x27;m doing spring cleaning.  I advise cleaning up your diet while doing this as well-the cleaner the better.  I also like neem oil as an after treatment for feet, repeat daily.  It&#x27;s less worry some than the new chemical peel for feet that turns your feet into a molting mess for a week.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough yet.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! We have never used it before and we where unaware initially of its healing properties. After some research we ordered this and tried it... Amazing! We used it as a facial mask, back mask and we use some in our homemade products. We intend on using it for our Daughter&#x27;s Eczema too. It will leave your skin red at first but it goes away... We followed the recommended reciepes but incorporated brewed herbal tea for some of them. This is a great natural alternative for us. We plan on buying this product again!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:1b5906ccc7a62ad0d099fa4dff8c9ee5]] After my bad day yesterday, I covered myself head to toe in this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did receive this for review purposes, all opinions expressed are my own</li>
    <li> Received item quickly as well as the e-book with no issues.  Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try the clay yet but looking forward to it! (Hence the 4 stars)</li>
    <li> I use this clay to do an armpit detox with great results.  (detox from wellness mama website)</li>
    <li> Love this product for facials!</li>
    <li> I love this clay!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is awsome i have used this as a mask. It made my skin soft. I will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that tends break out.I used this as a mask. .and was very pleased...my skin felt tighter and looked brighter. ....the next morning...it didnt look as blotchy. I LOVE that there are so many ways to use this !!! I dont think i want to share this with anyone in my house !! Will be purchasing more !!!</li>
    <li> What a great mask! I followed the exact instructions and noticed that I needed to add a tad bit more water to get the right consistency.  After applying the mask, I instantly felt a cooling sensation. I&#x27;ve tried other similar clay masks, and usually I have experienced a slight tingling sensation. With this product, it was very soothing.  I left the mask on for about 20 minutes. After removing it, I was quite pleased to find my skin to be incredibly smooth. So smooth that I may skip moisturizer for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> I got this product in hopes that it would clear up some acne red spots on my nose area. I just used the regular facial mixture that was on the back of the container, and after the first use I could instantly notice the red spots lightened if not went away completely. My face is also a lot softer then it usually is. I love how there is a good amount of the product in the container, and for the price it is hard to beat. The drawbacks of this product is that the mixture is harder to mix up. It is a strange consistency and it hard to apply evenly on your face. Also my product didn&#x27;t come with the free scoop that was advertised. Overall, this is a good product and I am going to try different recipes for the feet and hair.</li>
    <li> This Bentonite clay is wonderful! I have used it twice so far since reciving it, My skin feels much softer and even after using it. I hope to keep seeing my skin get brighter and more glowing over time. Just make sure to moisturize after usuing is as they tell you because it will dehydrate the skin (its suposed to) because it pulls impurities from the skin.</li>
    <li> I love the clay...I feel so much cleaner after use...like I have just pulled so many toxins and junk out of my body...I like that it&#x27;s a powder and you mix with water or vinegar ....this way the whole jar doesn&#x27;t dry up and go to waste...great product!</li>
    <li> I have only use this product once but have had several compliments on how nice my skin looks. My skin is soft and smooth. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Solid product. Was shipped and arrived promptly. Enjoyed the array of recipes they send you for free too. Tip- start mixing with a small amount of powder at first, you can always add more!</li>
    <li> I bought this clay for clay baths. I enjoyed it &amp; felt very relaxed after however the clay is very clumpy &amp; all of it didn&#x27;t dissolve.</li>
    <li> Love this product... I tried the Indian Clay mask first and was amazed how great my skin felt.  You can feel the mask pull the toxins out... Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other recipes.  Such a great product and I would highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way  a d made my face feel amazing!</li>
    <li> its great and very amazing</li>
    <li> Extremely fast shipping!  I am using this product to make clay masks.  The clay is very finely ground and is like a powder. It works well!</li>
    <li> This product is very well made and packaged. The consistency is very fine and mixes extremely well compared to others that I&#x27;ve tried with other makers. I love the recipe ebook that they emailed my and the scoop that it comes with is really a nice bonus too!</li>
    <li> Complete skin transformation. My skin was a bit brighter,  tighter nd just felt overall healthier. This is a must have in your beauty regiment :)</li>
    <li> Glad I bought this I was able to tell a difference after one use my skin feels so smooth and looks brighter and I love the Ebook they sent its full of good recipes</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! My face feels like I just got back from the spa!</li>
    <li> What an awesome product! My only regret is not knowing about it sooner. This was the first time I had ever heard about this product. So I tried the face mask and my initial reaction was yuck! This is way too thick and takes way too long to dry. 20-30 minutes is the recommended time for the mask but I knew I could not handle this product on my face for that long. So I went about 10 minutes and removed it. Now the mask came off much better than I expected but you will want to use a washcloth. My face was so smooth and soft. And it lasted for days and I did not even need my regular moisturizer. I am so impressed. There is no smell and the texture wet feels what it sounds like, wet clay. So I began to look into other uses and found there are many that claim this product to be great for many things. I am now a fan of bentonite clay. I will soon be trying the product in the bath. I look forward to the soft smooth skin all over and the added bonus of having toxins pulled from my body in the process. I believe if you give this product a try you will be a fan as well.I received this product in exchange for my honest review</li>
    <li> I love that this product is all natural.  I used as a mask on my 40 something skin, and was amazed at how smooth and refreshed it felt.&lt;br /&gt;Plan on letting my 16 year old daughter use it on her acne prone skin.  I truly believe that it is a product for all ages.</li>
    <li> I received my jar today...after my long workout I decided to give it a try.and me always the skeptic Not sure what to expect but my face is bright,soft with a supple texture.May i say even a little glowy. I&#x27;ll order another.have a party to go to so I&#x27;ll use it again that day...yeah</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to mix, goes on easy. I use it on my face and neck and I&#x27;ve had noticed my skin is so much smoother and not so dry.</li>
    <li> Love all you can do with it. Especially the face mask</li>
    <li> I love this. First time trying it and I cannot get enough. I have tried a few of the recipes from the book. I love  mixing it with my essential oils. I just it for acne and it works great. Leaves my sink feeling amazing and has helped my acne problem.</li>
    <li> A big jar of a wonderful clay mask powder that will leave you with clean and soft skin.  I love that there are recipes for making it your own, with whatever scent and consistency you like.  I received it very promptly (as always with La Lune) and love the powder.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing. I am not a huge fan on masking my face, so i decided to use the product and do the clay bath. The minute I stepped into the bath I was like Wow!!! It latterly felt like I was relaxing in the hot tub. I felt so refreshed and when i got out my skin was so soft, my husband said I was glowing. I deffinately am going to be using this product often. I actually will try my very first masking next week. I also can&#x27;t wait to do the foot spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such an amazing product that works</li>
    <li> The product was shipped very quickly and it arrived undamaged. I was super excited to try it! There is no scent to the clay whichis superb as i am very sensitive to fragrances. The recipie book was emailed in eBook format and has a bunch of different facials and uses for the clay. I am very satisfied with this and i will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I love this face mask. I&#x27;ve tried many different natural face masks and this one has worked best for me. Not only does this come with instructions on how to make a variety of different types of masks but it also literally sucks the dirty right out of your pores! I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I gave myself a clay facial yesterday and my skin has never felt more soft!</li>
    <li> I use this clay twice a week and I love how my skin looks and feels!!!</li>
    <li> This mask is AMAZING!  I could honestly feel it working, which I was definitely not expecting!  And I love that the company sent me multiple recipies for all different uses!  Love it and would for sure recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Amazing my face feels so smooth</li>
    <li> What an amazing product!! Love that it&#x27;s all natural and makes me skin feel great. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Ok..I am a brand name junkie...I only buy products from major department stores and I have to say how VERY happy I am with this product!  Completely exceeds my expectations!  I can not wait to try again and so appreciate the tips on how to use most effectively!  Yay!</li>
    <li> Large container-great value for the price! My skin is sensitive, and I appreciate there were instructions for sensitive skin. I feel like I just had a spa quality facial at home-my skin feels so soft and clean!</li>
    <li> I loved this product! I used it as a face mask and it made my skin feel great! I love that it comes in a powder and there are so many different recipes that I can use for multiple different things. My next goal is going to be using it for a bath! Would definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone who wants to use natural products.</li>
    <li> The clay was easy to mix and really tightened up my skin. I found it easier to remove in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great for your hair and skin.  Recommend to purchase.  This is Sodium and Calcium which is a little more harsh.</li>
    <li> Great product. It is economical, easy to use, and the results are great!</li>
    <li> Great product! Came quickly and  a large size tub</li>
    <li> This stuff really does what it says it does. I use it on my face but mix with ac vinegar instead of water for a smoother application. If you have sensitive skin (as i do) it can be a bit drying so make sure and use a good moisturizer after. I plan to try it on my feet later. You get a LOT of product in this jar so it is well worth the amount paid.</li>
    <li> I mix this with lemon juice or apple cider vinegar and a few drops of Young Living Essential Oil for a facial/throat mask to draw out impurities in the skin and pores. Skin feels so smooth and glowing afterwards! Company seems interested in clients and their performance - they did a follow up after the sale.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Easy to mix and apply. I waited about 30 minutes and rinsed off. My skin felt so smooth. A little pink for about an hour but that&#x27;s because I left it on a little long. Honestly I can&#x27;t wait to do it again.</li>
    <li> the mask is okay. It was tough on my very sensitive skin and it broke me out a bit but I think why I broke out was due to another reason so I&#x27;m willing to still give the mask another attempt to really see the benefit it claims to do. I was a little disappointed mine came with no scoop so I had to get a scoop for it but it does leave your face feeling refreshed after use not bad! (:</li>
    <li> I took a couple baths with this product.  It&#x27;s an okay product.  I can tell my skin is a teeny bit softer after moisturizing but it is not substantially noticeable.  Everyone&#x27;s body is different so maybe mine isn&#x27;t that responsive to bentonite.</li>
    <li> This purchase gets five stars yes When I first used it I saw a difference in my skin, I wanted to use it a week before I reviewed.  I see a brightness in my skin (I&#x27;m using it on my face and neck area) and after a week of use it feels smooth no longer oily in my T zone...I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase and plan on continue use and will recommend to others and let my girlfriends know the have to give this product a chance.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! SAW A DIFFERENCE AFTER THE FIRST USE!</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave 4 stars for this product is because I just received it a few days ago.  I tried it this morning and really like the way it left my skin feeling, silky smooth.  I will update at a later date after I&#x27;ve used it a few more times and can see better results...</li>
    <li> Several people had recommended I try bentonite clay and I am glad a friend gave me a chance to try this product. As a first warning do not mix this clay onto something metal, it will decrease the effectiveness of the clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this clay for a few things now. Initially I bought it to heal a burn that left a red mark, a pretty large red mark. It&#x27;s been working on that. I&#x27;ve also started using it on my chin which has helped with the discoloration and blackheads that i thought were permanant dark marks of pores that constantly got blackheads. My chin is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as a foot detox as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best though, I used this on a boil, and it drew out the gross stuff right away. This will be my go to for boils, as well as bug bites. This works way better than calamine lotion on bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some info about bentonite incase you don&#x27;t know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Mountain Rose Herbs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Bentonite, also referred to as Montmorillonite, is one of the most effective and powerful healing clays. Bentonite can be used externally as a clay poultice, mud pack or in the bath and, in skin care recipes. A good quality Bentonite should be a grey/cream color and anything bordering “pure white” is suspect. It has a very fine, velveteen feel and is odorless and non-staining. The type of bentonite offered by Mountain Rose herbs is a Sodium Bentonite.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite Clay is composed of aged volcanic ash. The name comes from the largest known deposit of Bentonite Clay located in Fort Benton, Wyoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Bentonite is a swelling clay. When it becomes mixed with water it rapidly swells open like a highly porous sponge. From here the toxins are drawn into the sponge through electrical attraction and once there, they are bound.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite clay carries a strong negative charge which bonds to the positive charge in many toxins. When it comes in contact with a toxin, chemical, or heavy metal, the clay will absorb the toxin and release it’s minerals for the body to use. Bentonite also helps get oxygen to cells as it pulls excess hydrogen and allows the cells to replace it with oxygen instead.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest reviewwill absorb the toxin and release it’s minerals for the body to use. Bentonite also helps get oxygen to cells as it pulls excess hydrogen and allows the cells to replace it with oxygen instead.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bentonite clay for my hair and skin with good results.  La Lune is definitely a higher quality product than I have used in the past.  I could tell the difference after using it just once.  I think the difference is that this is Sodium Bentonite which is more effective at pulling the toxins from my skin.  My face felt so clean after just one use.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the foot mask tonight. The recipes sent with the order were a nice touch!  Can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic I used it for my face and a spa bath and it works amazing. It is especially good for the winter because it leaves your skin so smooth and hydrated! Amazing product !</li>
    <li> I recieved the jar and as soon as I used it worked great! I recommend it to everybody</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, who has eczema and very sensitive skin due to Rx that have not worked for her.  She loves the smoothness and gentleness it has brought to her skin.  I am just happy I am not having to continue to look for products for her anymore.  She looks and feels beautiful.  So thankful for all the positive and true comments that have made me a happy momma and her a happy young lady.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite product so far!!! The quick delivery was amazing. I love the detox bath, wow does it work! And using it as a clay on my face was great, I used the recipe book that was sent to me and did the apple cinder vinegar facial- works wonders!!! Absolutely suggest this product!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product is that a little amount goes a long way. It&#x27;s really a great deal! It can get a little messy, so I recommend washing it off in the shower. Once I was done, my face felt so soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve shared it with a couple of my friends and they loved it too. I can&#x27;t wait to try it again. I will definitely be coming back for more.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I ordered this product. The shipping was quick and the costumer service was great.  Soon after ordering I received an e-mail from La Lune Naturals with recipes and other information.  There are a lot of good recipes and I am looking forward to trying several of them.  I really appreciate that these products are cruelty free and vegan.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this clay powder! It stopped a couple of pimples in their tracks! I made the mask with 50/50 water and apple cider vinegar (sensitive skin) and put it on my face for about half an hour. The pimples were not gone when I took it off, but when I woke up the next morning they were much smaller and very concealable. The seller also emails you a free ebook with clay recipes for your face, hair, feet, and even a spot treatment for bee stings!  It would have gotten 5 stars but for the fact that the mask gets so TIGHT when it&#x27;s drying! And feeling like somebody is trying to make your face slimmer by force is not very relaxing! It IS a good product so I will still use it for spot treatments, honey masks, and  foot masks but not a full on clay mask.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! Amazing quality, and it was delivered very promptly. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Easy to make and use. Leaves skin smooth and glowing!</li>
    <li> Good product. And fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have used bentonite clay in capsules for cleansing and detox. I have tried this powder in a face mask (so easy to make) and in my bath. I love having more ways to use it.</li>
    <li> I found this to be better compared to the other products i have used before.</li>
    <li> I purchased La Lune Naturals a few weeks ago. I use 3-4 times per week. I love it. It heals blemishes and open sores and my pores are much smaller. I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> This product worked great when I added some of my essential oils to make a facial. It mixed quickly and was not gritty. Also used it as a poultice on a bug bite.</li>
    <li> OMG I love love this stuff. Talk about super soft skin!! I made a face mask with this  and my face felt amazing. I also took a bath with putting some in the bath water. I did notice my skin feeling a sli9ght softer than my normal soaps which is Aveeno.</li>
    <li> Great for your skin.  You can feel relaxed like when you get a mud bath at a spa when your at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses include: Antioxidant masks, foot creams, and sooths bug bites/bee stings, rash or helps bruising.  Great for children who are rough and getting into things.</li>
    <li> I really like how it made my face feel the next morning</li>
    <li> Very pleased on every level.</li>
    <li> Not a bad deal for five bucks!! I love facial products. This product was a little difficult to get the right consistency, &amp; get even on my face. But I will continue to use it, Thanks for the deal!</li>
    <li> Works great! Used as an armpit detox with raw acv and my pits are awesome</li>
    <li> Great product and customer service!</li>
    <li> did a face mask yesterday..wow its invigorating</li>
    <li> It was a relaxing experience.I will have to try it a couple more times to see what improvements have been made.</li>
    <li> seriously feels like you got a facelift! amazing but hard to get the right consistency, make you you youtube how to mix properly</li>
    <li> I am loving this, I have used it many times since it arrived. Great quality, fast shipping. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. I really prefer the other clay mask that&#x27;s &amp;#34;Aztec secret&amp;#34; but I believe everyone&#x27;s skin reacts different so maybe it just wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> Wonderful. ...everything I was looking for plus more. Very prompt delivery! !</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have used it as a facial mask so far and my skin has never felt cleaner.  The more I use it, the better my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> This one is great my grand daughter uses it for acne good remedy.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this in the mail today! I tried the mud mask tonight and I have to say that after 1 use I can tell a difference in my skin! My face already feels softer and refreshed! I have very dry/sensitive skin and this was irritating at all. I can&#x27;t wait to look through all the recipes you receive with this purchase and try something new with it! Definitely worth the purchase and I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I am totally impressed so far with this product.  After usin it my skin was so nice and soft.  Have only done  the apple cider mask so far..may try the Cleopatra tonight since we have such gr8 natural honey here in Barbados!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT product!! I absolutely love it. My skin feels soft and smooth after each application. I would recommend the Aztec Healing Clay to anyone-Beth</li>
    <li> WOW! My daughter loves this! She has &amp;#34;teenage&amp;#34;  skin and this has done wonders for her. She is a very satisfied customer! :)</li>
    <li> I received my product as promised, upon receiving this clay I used it immediately.  I was surprised by the results everyone that I came in contact with (who knew me) noticed and commented on my hair.  It was so manageable and bouncy I followed the instructions for making the hair mask but it was way too much.  I recently cut my hair so I didn&#x27;t use as much, the only thing that I don&#x27;t really care for is that it is mud therefore when I rinsed my hair I used a pail to catch the water to keep it from going down the drain, It really did work for me.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it from quality, shipping,  the product and it&#x27;s neat. Good job!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get the ebook that&#x27;s supposed to come with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times since I purchased it and I absolutely love it.. so does my daughter and sister in law. I think it works better at 20 mins instead of 30 mins though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:3f9425c0716af93f1986fc09e586330c]] Lalune Naturals&#x27; Indian Healing Clay was so much better than I expected! I have extremely dry skin and it is very sensitive. I was quite hesitant to use this clay as a facial mask because I have had horrible results with other masks. Most masks dry my face out even more or cause me to break out. This did not do that at all. Yes, it did itch a little while on my face just because the clay was drying. And there was initial redness after I removed it (because the blood was circulating), but it went away within a couple of hours. My face felt amazing afterwards! It wasn&#x27;t any drier than before I did the mask. And after I applied lotion my face felt so smooth and looked so vibrant! It really did awaken my skin. And I can&#x27;t prove that it removed toxins, but I feel like it did. And I believe that the Sodium Bentonite Clay really does have healing properties because I use another form of sodium to heal my face, scratches, sores, and bruises all of the time. Amazing product. Absolutely the best mask I have ever used. I will continue to use it even though I received this sample in return for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Everything it should be!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in a timely manner and it was well received by my family members.</li>
    <li> I got a coupon code from ILovetoreview to get this product. I received it yesterday and used it right away. I like how thick it is. I feel like my face was squeaky clean after and soft. Now, Ive only used it once so Idk how much better it would be in few more use.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful organic mask that leaves your skin feeling smooth, soft and a little tingling. (Tingles and slight redness lasts about an hour). I used water to mix my mask although the next time I&#x27;m going to try mixing with Apple Cider Vinegar. Once mixed I put it in a small electrical crock that I normally use for melting wax. The warmth of the mixture felt really good. I would also recommend leaving it on for 30 minutes. The first time I only left it on for 15 minutes and couldn&#x27;t really feel the tingles as I did with 30 minutes. Once I feel my skin has been purged of impurities I will use a couple times a week. A little goes a long way! I also appreciate the quick turn around from placing my order to receiving product just shy of 48 hours.</li>
    <li> I love that this product comes in power form.  I have very sensitive skin so being able to make a batch of the clay to be able to suit my skin was wonderful.  Since I do have such sensitive skin I did a test patch first and had no issues.  I did a full mask later that night and had great results.  My skin felt clean and smooth.  I like that you can even do a bath with this product, makes you feel like you are in a spa at your own home.  I am excited to try other products in the La Lune Naturals line.</li>
    <li> I received my clay within 3 days and I absolutely love it. It was super fine and I have used it for a clarifying mask on my face and hair. Yes you can use bentotite clay for hair. This is 100% organic and high quality. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I tried this mask this morning.  A little goes a loooooong way.  This tub will last for. ever.  It is extremely powerful, dries very tight and fully.  I think it will be great for my oil prone skin.  My face was so soft and completely clean when i washed it off.  My newly deep cleaned skin sucked up my serum and my makeup went on flawlessly after.  It is just one ingredient too.  No yuck additives.  One scoop is way too much for your face.  I will mix much less next time.  Also can be used in baths? Not sure what to think about all that but im sure i will try it sometime to see.  Excellent detoxing deep cleaning face mask!</li>
    <li> This Indian Healing Clay is so easy to use! The recipes that come with the free eBook are great. I&#x27;ve already tried the sensitive healing mask and it was magical! I look forward to trying the other recipes for this product! Fast shipping and great packaging from a wonderful company!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this as a face mask yet, but I&#x27;ve used it in the bath. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  Plan on trying all the other recipe soon.</li>
    <li> Each of the La Lune products make fantastic gifts for my wife.  The service is very fast and professional.  I highly recommend trying each of their products!</li>
    <li> Received when promised. I found it hard to mix, very lumpy. Used it anyway. Skin was soft after use.  Will try to get a smoother mix of the clay when I have more time.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and purchased this to hopefully help with that problem.  I have only used it once, but my skin looked flawless with no makeup afterwards. I will definitely keep ordering from this product. I was expecting it to have more of a &amp;#34;dirt gritty texture&amp;#34; but it was a silky smooth powder and a little goes a long way! I used one scoop (provided in the container) and it was too much for just my face.</li>
