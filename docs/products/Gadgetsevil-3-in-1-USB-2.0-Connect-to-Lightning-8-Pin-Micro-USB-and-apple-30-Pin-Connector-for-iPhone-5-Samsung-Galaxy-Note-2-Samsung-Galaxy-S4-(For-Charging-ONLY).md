### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>We are delighted with this order!</li>
      <li>This works great for charging all my devices.</li>
      <li>no issues, just works at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;tested</li>
      <li>Happy at this point and ordering others.</li>
      <li>device charges each one successfully.</li>
      <li>does* work for data on iPhones 5s using the Lightning cable, even though the product description warns they may be good for \\&quot;charging only.\\</li>
      <li>free included USB micro-SD card reader is a good one, detecting a 16 GB µSD card; it is the tiniest µSD card reader we&#x27;ve ever seen, very handy.)</li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s ok having 3 chargers connected to one power source.</li>
      <li>Its ok, I would not purchase another one</li>
      <li>But hey for the price I was ok with it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to wiggle it and make it work.  </li>
      <li>I got one and my family loved it so much I ordered more for them.</li>
      <li>They arrived from Hong Kong to California in 10 calendar days despite 2 weekends &amp; Memorial Day holiday -- very quick.</li>
      <li>the 30 pin and mini work just fine.  </li>
      <li>Just took a while to receive the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was adequate!</li>
      <li>If it won&#x27;t fit, flip it over...</li>
      <li>Perfect for the car because the cable length is short enough to keep my devices secure on the console.</li>
      <li>30 pin connector has markings on top and bottom, so it&#x27;s not simple to determine the top or bottom.</li>
      <li>, right?  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I have to insert and remove the iPhone 5 lightening connector to seat it right, otherwise it won&#x27;t charge.</li>
      <li>It worked great for the first few weeks but now has stopped working.  </li>
      <li>of note: I&#x27;m learning that one outlet only has so many amps (I believe 2.0A or 2.4A.)</li>
      <li>It would make for a perfect-bedside-charger/car-charger if it only had more length.</li>
      <li>First I would have given no stars but that wasn&#x27;t an option.</li>
      <li>Wish the cords were an inch longer but other than that great, especially for travel.  </li>
      <li>They sent me the older connectors for the first iPhone.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to using this.  </li>
      <li>This is working very well for me.  </li>
      <li>also think my iphone was not working as fast as it could.  </li>
      <li>This item is not recognized by any of my devices.&lt;br /&gt;The idea was great, but the performance is poor .</li>
      <li>My main reason for ordering was for the iPhone 5 charger/connector.</li>
      <li>I wish the cables were a little bit longer, but it is very handy and it makes travelling less cluttered.</li>
      <li>people will want a usb extension, since the cable is very short and can easily unplug the USB cable plugging in the phone or other device.</li>

<li> the 30-pin connector did provide charging only, no data.&lt;br /&gt;Since this adapter cable is only 6 inches long, it&#x27;s often cumbersome to use it with an iPad</li>
<li> It should state not average cord length but 1/5 of average cord lenght.</li>
<li> had to wait a long time for the merchandise, but everything seems to be working fine!&lt;br</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t have long cables to deal with.</li>
<li> A bit delicate and the cables are really short but with a little care it should last a bit.</li>
<li> recommend ordering only from Gadgetsevil directly for this Gadgetsevil item; this is because one other vendor which supposedly carried this Gadgetsevil part sent the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not useful for me.</li>
<li> Why do companies like this waste our time with junk products like this?</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s broken</li>
<li> Sent me wrong connector.</li>

    <li> This item is not recognized by any of my devices.&lt;br /&gt;The idea was great, but the performance is poor .</li>
    <li> A bit delicate and the cables are really short but with a little care it should last a bit. For the price it&#x27;s ok having 3 chargers connected to one power source.</li>
    <li> These cables don&#x27;t work on Apple 5, or newer devices after the 7.0.4 software update. It posts a &amp;#34;notice&amp;#34; that it may not work and then won&#x27;t let it charge. Sometimes, flipping it over will let it work, but not always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 30 pin connector has markings on top and bottom, so it&#x27;s not simple to determine the top or bottom. If it won&#x27;t fit, flip it over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The micro USB works for my android well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people will want a usb extension, since the cable is very short and can easily unplug the USB cable plugging in the phone or other device.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using this.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s broken or if it&#x27;s just a rip off, either way it doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve tried to plug it in several places.  My iPhone 5s showed a message that said \\&quot;This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It is a definite must if it worked all the time.  Its ok, I would not purchase another one but I needed an adapter like this.&lt;br /&gt;I also think my iphone was not working as fast as it could.  I wonder why apple does not have a product like this???  hmmm makes you wonder appls intentions, right?  Just saying.</li>
    <li> I wish the cables were a little bit longer, but it is very handy and it makes travelling less cluttered.</li>
    <li> Not reliable.  It worked great for the first few weeks but now has stopped working.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with the charger for iphone 5.  The picture and decription lied. The cord is very short. Not buying from this store ever again.</li>
    <li> This is working very well for me.  Between my phone,my husband, and my daughter&#x27;s phones.  I used to carry three cords in my car.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can charge all three and not have all of these cords in my car!  Just two!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had to wait a long time for the merchandise, but everything seems to be working fine!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was as they stated when purchased.  Just took a while to receive the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was adequate!</li>
    <li> I have an iPhone 4S, Retina iPad (non lightening connector,) and a micro usb power case for the 4S. My gf has the iPhone 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device charges each one successfully. It will even charge two devices at the same time. I have not tried to charge 3 devices at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two issues. Sometimes I have to insert and remove the iPhone 5 lightening connector to seat it right, otherwise it won&#x27;t charge. This only happens &#x27;sometimes.&#x27;  Second, the length of this cable is curiously short. It would make for a perfect-bedside-charger/car-charger if it only had more length. It&#x27;s about 6\\&quot; (that&#x27;s it.) I&#x27;d plan on purchasing a usb extension cable which is what I am doing on amazon today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note: I&#x27;m learning that one outlet only has so many amps (I believe 2.0A or 2.4A.) I wonder if there are any side effects of splitting the prescribed amps for an apple device (which I believe is the 2.4 amps) to charge two devices simultaneously. During one month of use, I have no side effects to report.</li>
    <li> This works great for charging all my devices. I got one and my family loved it so much I ordered more for them. Perfect for the car because the cable length is short enough to keep my devices secure on the console. I don&#x27;t have to worry about them moving around in the car and I don&#x27;t have long cables to deal with. I&#x27;ve been using mine for months with no problems.</li>
    <li> The length if the cord isn&#x27;t advertised it extremely short. It should state not average cord length but 1/5 of average cord lenght.</li>
    <li> no issues, just works at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;tested with my iPhone, iPad and the uSD adapter works too.&lt;br /&gt;great value.</li>
    <li> First I would have given no stars but that wasn&#x27;t an option. The cable came from China and took three weeks to get here and I have a Prime account. Then it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Bad product</li>
    <li> We are delighted with this order! We bought 2 of the Lightning/MicroUSB/30 pin adapters. They arrived from Hong Kong to California in 10 calendar days despite 2 weekends &amp; Memorial Day holiday -- very quick. This adapter *does* work for data on iPhones 5s using the Lightning cable, even though the product description warns they may be good for \\&quot;charging only.\\&quot; We can manage content on iPhone 5s with iTunes, no problems. \\&quot;This cable or accessory is not certified\\&quot; alerts does NOT appear on the 5s.&lt;br /&gt;With our iPhone 4, 4s &amp; iPad2 the 30-pin connector did provide charging only, no data.&lt;br /&gt;Since this adapter cable is only 6 inches long, it&#x27;s often cumbersome to use it with an iPad any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-way adapter link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F6TWAIU/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recommend ordering only from Gadgetsevil directly for this Gadgetsevil item; this is because one other vendor which supposedly carried this Gadgetsevil part sent the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The free included USB micro-SD card reader is a good one, detecting a 16 GB µSD card; it is the tiniest µSD card reader we&#x27;ve ever seen, very handy.)</li>
    <li> Item recieved today, works on all three devices. No pop up message in iPhome 5s. Happy at this point and ordering others.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 of these in two different orders. 1 didn&#x27;t work at all. But hey for the price I was ok with it. Wish the cords were an inch longer but other than that great, especially for travel.  I have heard lots of jealous comments in airports.</li>
    <li> It is defective! It doesn&#x27;t work.  I have an iPhone 5.  Plug it in and nothing.  I try the connection for my ipad2, nothing happens.  Nothing works.  I will return this item.</li>
    <li> As soon as I plugged this into my iPad Mini, I got a message saying the device wasn&#x27;t supported.  I wasn&#x27;t able to wiggle it and make it work.  Then, the cover around the lightening connector slid off.  Why do companies like this waste our time with junk products like this?</li>
    <li> Sent me wrong connector. My main reason for ordering was for the iPhone 5 charger/connector. They sent me the older connectors for the first iPhone. Not useful for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t charge the lighting devices&lt;br /&gt;But the 30 pin and mini work just fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again ever ever</li>
