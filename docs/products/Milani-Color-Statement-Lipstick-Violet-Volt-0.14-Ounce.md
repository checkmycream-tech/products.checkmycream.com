    <li> I have spent lots of money and time looking for a lipstick colors that I really like. Finally, I accidently discovered MILANI lipstick in colors Bronze Beauty, which any color skin type could wear. Another lip color I love is Violet Volt it looks like purple but don&#x27;t let that stop you from trying it. . I like pink but have not been able to find a color pink I wanted until I discovered Violet Volt.it&#x27;s beautiful!! I have light skin and blonde hair both colors I&#x27;ve mentioned are wonderful..... In addition the product cost exstreamly reasonable..</li>
    <li> this color is a nice sheen of a dark pink and wears pretty well. when i line my lips with a dark purple lipliner and add the lipstick on top it creates such a beautiful purple!! which is the look i am going for :)</li>
    <li> Color is nice and bright but I would have preferred matte. Will be great for spring and summer.</li>
    <li> Received on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and formula...as always! Every color statement lipstick I have purchased has been wonderful. Looking forward to more colors.</li>

    <li> what a great lipstick and the color is great</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try violet because I am so used to reds and pinks. I am glad I ordered this lipstick because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Milani based on it&#x27;s positive reviews and I&#x27;ve also been wanting to try a violet or purple lipstick. This lipstick goes on smooth and the color is absolutely beautiful. I believe it would look good on any skin tone (I have light-medium skin). If you are on the fence about this because you think you might look scary wearing purple lipstick, trust me you won&#x27;t because I also had the same hesitation.</li>
    <li> Milani makes vibrant, bold lipsticks; I have many of their shades.  I was disappointed, however, to find that this specific lip color was not as pictured; I was hoping for a true purple, but the color is more pink than purple.</li>
    <li> Love this light purple of a color. It is not too dark and looks like a light feminine purple. I love it! The lipstick smells great and feels nice on my lips. I will definitely buy more colors from this brand.</li>
    <li> Beatiful color and fast shiping</li>
    <li> This lip color was a GREAT color but it didn&#x27;t last.  I usually get stains but I loved this purple color.  It&#x27;ll teach me to get anything but my favorite stains.  If you don&#x27;t mind re-applying, go for it.</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful color of Lipstick that is also very in Vogue right now. Please keep me informed of new seasonal colors. Thank You</li>
    <li> Love it  smells good and it makes your lips soft it does stay on for couple of hours and it&#x27;s beautiful color.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be darker.</li>
    <li> Love these Milani Lipsticks!!!!!!!!!! Love the color!!!!!!!!!!! I got myself quite a few in varies colors.</li>
