      <li>Great control to trim those tiny fingers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing!!! We tried baby clippers, real clippers (scary! never again), baby nail file, real nail file, biting nails (that was weird)... and these are the only things that are effective, quick, and not scary. A must, must have for babies. The curved edge is built just for a baby&#x27;s mini-fingernail and although they feel dull to the touch, they are sharp enough to quickly trim nails!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy these scissors because of the price, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought them. They are great and surprisingly well worth the money! My 5 year old daughter hated the clippers I had been using, but we all love these scissors. I use them on both my kids. No more fuss!</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review of nail scissors, but...these things are fantastic!  The curved blades make it very easy to maneuver around and trim baby&#x27;s tiny nails safely and easily.  Don&#x27;t even bother trying to use baby nail clippers that come with grooming kits, just buy these. I will be including these with every shower gift I give in the future.</li>
    <li> Amazing baby scissors. I recommend to all my friends and have bought two pairs already. Still even use a pair that I have had for over 5 years. Won&#x27;t cut your baby and very safe.</li>
    <li> After using nail clippers and cutting our baby twice, we needed a new product. Our pediatrician told us we should never use clippers on a baby and instead to get baby nail scissors so we did.  These are awesome, there is no way to cut your baby because of the way they are angled.  Even if she moves around, I can still cut her nails without injuring her.  Yea, they&#x27;re not cheap but worth every penny.  This is a must for all parents!</li>
    <li> As a first time mom I was so fearful of cutting my newborn&#x27;s nails. I had little clippers and I did not even attempt to use those once I got them near her tiny little fingers. These make it so simple and much safer. I currently have to trim her nails every other day and it is now not stressful for me or her. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I tried using the baby nail clippers and found them hard to use. After a traumatic incident that included drawing some blood, I got these scissors and never looked back.  These are great - they feel safer when I&#x27;m using them and I feel like I have a lot more control.</li>
    <li> these scissors are great.  sharp.  i haven&#x27;t had any accidents with them.  much easier to use than clippers</li>
    <li> After nicking my daughter&#x27;s tender skin with the Red Cross baby clippers, I was horrified by the thought of ever cutting her nails again and I put mittens on her constantly for the next two months. Finally, a friend recommended Tweezerman&#x27;s scissors, so I gave them a shot. My daughter is 8 months old now and I&#x27;ve been cutting her nails regularly since she was about 3 months old with the scissors, and I&#x27;m so happy to say we&#x27;ve never had an \\&quot;incident.\\&quot; They are wonderful, and I&#x27;m buying them for all my expecting friends!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I will admit that sometimes I cut my kids nails too short with these, but I feel much more confident than with clippers. I have used them on kids from ages 1 month to 4 years old. I just sit them on my lap with their back to me and works great. There are complaints about having to sit still and not being able to hold the scissors themselves, but that is going to happen in my house no matter what I do. I count these as one of my best purchases ever.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other reviews. I hesitated to buy these because of the price, but I wish I had had them from day one. Every other option for cutting tiny nails is much less appealing. These are easy to use, sharp where they need to be and blunt where they need to be (to avoid cutting skin!) With all the times you will have to cut those nails, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Oh my...why isn&#x27;t this on every baby/child must-have list??  Forget the nail clippers that everyone says to buy, this is the way to go...I&#x27;m never EVER going back to clippers!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other reviews on here. These nail scissors are so easy to use, they are sharp and quick yet blunted in the right place so that you can&#x27;t accidently cut your baby&#x27;s finger. I got these after getting frustrated with those dreadful clipper type that never cut enough off, yet also sometimes took off skin.   These scissors come with a buffer too so you can buff away any sharpness. My baby&#x27;s face has been scratch-free since getting these, I am so relieved!</li>
    <li> These scissors are amazing, and so much better than clippers. They are easy to keep control of, and I don&#x27;t worry about cutting part of my baby&#x27;s finger off. The are a bit spendy for nail scissors, but once I used them I would have paid more for them.</li>
    <li> These nail scissors are the best- we have used them from birth and our daughter is 15 months old now. They are quick and cut with precision- I&#x27;ve never nicked her using these.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that these would be worth the cost, but they are! I used them to trim my baby&#x27;s nails when she was only four days old, and now that she&#x27;s 8 months old I use them to trim her rapidly moving hands and feet, and I have never once cut her with them. They are sturdy but easy to use, and they trim nails cleanly. A great purchase!</li>
    <li> After buying some baby clippers and found I didn&#x27;t dare to use it with my baby&#x27;s nails, I took my chance to buy this one after reading all the positive reviews. Man, I&#x27;m glad I spent the 20 or so bucks on this one which takes all the hassles away from fixing her little nails. It cut through the gentlest nails really easily, yet leaves me with no fear that I&#x27;m gonna cut my baby because of the design of the tip.</li>
    <li> These nail scissors have been amazing.  They are sharp and lined up well, so I can easily cut baby&#x27;s nails in one quick cut, and I can get them very short, allowing me to go a few extra days before needing to cut baby&#x27;s nails again.  I used to use another pair of cheap scissors that were relatively dull and started to misalign over time, causing baby&#x27;s nails to bend rather than cut.  I have been using these scissors for about 5 months now and they still cut great.</li>
    <li> These baby scissors are the absolute best quality.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other.  I lost my other ones while travelling and had to buy another one, regardless of the price and they are just perfect for my babies.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband bought the Tweezerman Yellow Baby Nail Scissors for our newborn. He frantically scratches his face. Well, not after we bought these nail scissors. I would definitely recommend this scissors to all my mommy friends. I was wary about using this to cut my baby&#x27;s nails as I always used nail cutter to cut nails myself and I never understood the concept of using scissors to cut nails. Not anymore! It is so easy to use that you cannot go wrong with it. I really like the design of the blades and the rubber handle for a good grip. I love the yellow color, difficult to misplace it. It also comes with nail filer which has fun images on it and is quite useful to file the edges smooth. Though the price is on the higher side, I am pretty sure it will serve the purpose till my LO becomes a toddler, so it will pay off.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after I managed to cut my baby several times trying to use nail clippers. He is a very active squirmy baby. Have not cut him since and I get the nails done too. A little overpriced but was worth my money</li>
    <li> I have a four-month-old baby--and up until a few weeks ago, I was spending half an hour every couple of days filing down his little nails. I bought a nail clipper--no success; it left sharp edges and was too scary to use. These scissors are the best! They have blunt edges (no fear of cutting the skin), and do the job in about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> These are the only way I can cut my toddler&#x27;s nails, and now that I have a new baby, i bought another set to always have one handy.  I don&#x27;t know why they are so much better than other nail scissors out there, but they are.  The weight is solid yet not bulky.  The curve is just right for precision cutting.  And somehow I don&#x27;t ever feel like I&#x27;m going to accidentally get skin with these (unlike how I feel when I tried clippers or other little scissors).  Give these with all my baby shower gifts now!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I ended up spending so much on something to clip my newborn&#x27;s nails but fortunately I can say that it has definitely been worth it! We have tried all the other (baby) nail clippers and found that they are just awkward to use when dealing with tiny toes and fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While giving you baby a bath just pull these out and trim his/her toenails. The water will make them soft, and the scissors&#x27; curved tip makes it very hard to hurt your baby. Our baby loves to kick around in the bath and (knock on wood!) we havent had any issues with accidentally nicking them with these scissors.</li>
    <li> Love love love-- I usually give these as part of shower gifts works so well -- you will never go back to clippers -- have never cut too short since using-- lasts forever -- totally worth the money</li>
    <li> Ever try using a nail clipper on a young, squirming baby?  Ever hear of stories were parents nipped the tip of their finger off?  Reduce the chances of injury and buy this (or a similar NAIL SCISSOR) for infant-toddler nail care.  There is a huge amount of trust a human needs to have to allow someone to cut around a very sensitive part of their body: if you cut them it can take months or longer for that trust and confidence to be restored again.  These scissors are not inexpensive, but they are very well built, will last many years, and are an excellent purchase.  Once again: use infant-toddler Scissors: not Nail Clippers- you&#x27;ll realize how much safer and more effective scissors are.</li>
    <li> I tried many other products.  I even bought overseas products (from other European countries).  Italian blades of these scissors are superb!  I have used on my 5 yr old for 5 years now and have just mailed these in for free sharpening, so that I can use on my baby.  Great job Tweezerman!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new add, I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the sharpening.  The scissors are not the same quality or function now.  I can only use them on my older child.  VERY LAME.  Better to purchase the $12 rounded tip Tweezerman at Sally&#x27;s, look for the one&#x27;s with the Italian blades, and use these as infant scissors &#x27;til they get dull and then buy another pair.  At least they&#x27;ll function as they should!  They are not as good as the baby one&#x27;s, but still have a similar thin blade that works fine.</li>
    <li> The best baby scissors ever. Using it for 7 months - not a single cut. I haven&#x27;t tried anything else, but these are really good.</li>
    <li> These are the best baby nail scissors ever. From tiny squirmy babies with soft nails to non-cooperative toddlers - these are the ones for you. I thought I wanted (and tried several versions) of the safety kind but these are much easier to maneuver and use. I buy them as a baby gift all the time. LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> We waited until our daughter was 10 weeks old to cut her nails because I was terrified we would hurt her... and on our first attempt with some generic baby clippers we managed to nick 4 of 10 little fingers! This first experience resulted in tears, bloody fingertips, and traumatized parents! Then at about 3 months old, we were having brunch with some friends who have twin girls lamenting about the nail situation and they showed us these scissors.  In about 2 minutes my husband trimmed all of her nails and didn&#x27;t nick her once! We bought them from Amazon the moment we got home.  They are so helpful and really the only thing we will ever use to give our daughter (and any future babies) a manicure.  They take the fear out of what can be a pretty scary experience.  And while they are pricey they are truly worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Baby nail scissors are soooo much easier and in my opinion safer than baby nail clippers.  This pair by Tweezerman is excellent, much better quality than some others I&#x27;ve purchased.  They are a bit pricey, but as always you get what you pay for.  I have had some other scissors that just kind of bend the nail rather than cutting it off, these provide a clean cut every time.</li>
    <li> Works great, much better than regular baby nail clippers. Can actually see what you are doing.</li>
    <li> about equal to the little Japanese scissors</li>
    <li> I LOVE these scissors. It is THE baby shower gift I must give.</li>
    <li> These are great. I was accidently nipping the tip of my newborns&#x27; fingers and making him cry...which make any new parents want to cry too...and bleed. I went everywhere to find a better nail clipper and after spending more then I want to admit on the same nail clipper just different packaging, my sister-in-law told me to get scissors. I looked for them on the internet and they are the best.  NO more bleeding fingertips and no more half cut nails. They also give you better and more precise control of what you are cutting since they are pretty sharp. As with all Tweezerman products, they will sharpen the scissors for free.</li>
    <li> After trying several different ways of cutting my newborns fingernails, these work the best.  Yes a little pricey, but worth every penny. Easy as pie to cut my sleeping babies nails!</li>
    <li> These scissors are wonderful for babies!  They are more expensive than other ones but very safe and at the same time, sharp.</li>
    <li> These are a must have for infants - I used these right when we got home from the hospital with baby girl. Her fingernails were super sharp and grew like crazy but she wouldn&#x27;t wear mittens. I&#x27;m not sure how anyone uses regular nail clippers safely, baby fingers are just too small. These work great and I&#x27;ve not once cut her skin. She&#x27;s several months old now and I use these every couple days. She moves around more so I try to do it when she is tired, but they work great!</li>
    <li> We use this to cut our kids nails. Great control to trim those tiny fingers. Great construction. We have 2.</li>
    <li> These are a pricey pair of nail scissors, but they are a safe way to trim baby&#x27;s nails.  We trim his nails when he is sleeping and have not had any problems yet.</li>
    <li> Several moms have told me that I needed to try baby nail scissors but I was always afraid to try them.  However, baby nail clippers don&#x27;t work well on soft, tiny little nails, and there is a risk of cutting too close.  Filing the nails is also an option, but it takes forever!  So, after baby #4, I finally decided to give these a try and I can&#x27;t believe I have waited so long!  These make trimming baby&#x27;s nails, fast, easy, and safe!  I was afraid that I would cut her, but actually it would be pretty hard to cut the skin with these.  I also like another reviewer&#x27;s tip:  put your thumb and middle finger through the handles of the scissors and use your index finger to stabilize the blades.  I was able to cut ALL of my 3 week old daughter&#x27;s nails in just a couple minutes and got them much shorter than I can when I file them.  Hopefully she won&#x27;t scratch her face up anymore!  These are pricy but worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> As with others who have commented here, we had hesitated because of the high price of this product. Having had a miserable time with another, conventional-style baby nail clipper, we bit the bullet and bought these scissors. There is no going back for us. These work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important advantage of this product is that it allows the user to see precisely where the clipping is occurring, so you can see yourself what is happening to your baby&#x27;s nails, instead of hoping that you are on target. In addition, these scissors allow you control the depth and angle of attack, so you can snip a little bit, adjust, snip even more, until you are in control. This ability is very handy when your baby does not always hold out his/her hands still, thus changing your angle constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is, due to all this control, you no longer fear clipping your baby&#x27;s nails because you need not be concerned about bloodying the little fingers.</li>
    <li> After nicking my infant with a clipper, I felt so bad that I immediately got online (after soothing his little finger) and ordered the baby nail scissors.  No nicks, cuts cleanly, and is blunt tipped so no poking my little one.  The file has a fine grit to get those little edges.  The baby doesn&#x27;t mind, although it&#x27;s easier to clip his nails when he&#x27;s napping.</li>
    <li> First, as relevant information, I am a surgeon and very familiar with high quality cutting instruments. The \\&quot;feel\\&quot;, fit, finish and function of these nail scissors are very close to those of the best surgical scissors I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Of course you have to be careful to avoid flesh cuts but, with these scissors and if you do it right, the chances of that happening are minimal.&lt;br /&gt;A little tip when using these or any other scissors for that matter; hold them with your thumb and middle finger in the eye rings and place the index finger along the scissors&#x27; body firmly resting the finger tip over the joint area. Please trust me on this, with the index finger in that position you will have much more control over the scissors. Also cut the nails when you are calm, have the time and baby is sleepy or sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;For the first two or three month or while the nails are still \\&quot;attached\\&quot; to the flesh is safer to use a nail file. After that I doubt that there is anything better than the Tweezerman Yellow Baby Nail Scissors.</li>
    <li> I wish I had these scissors when I had my 1st child.  I use these on my 4mo and my 3yo.  Much safer then nail clippers and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The only baby nail scissor that we ever use.</li>
    <li> Just as other reviews mentioned it does what it is supposed to and does it well. Very much recommended for babies 2 months plus.</li>
    <li> These are a little pricey for what they are, but they are the only product that cuts my son&#x27;s nails without fear of also cutting his skin.  I had a bad experience with nail clippers when my niece was a baby.  Never again.  I&#x27;ve tried other nail scissors, but they all seem to cause those thin, delicate nails to fold over, rather than cutting them.  These actually work.  Buy them!</li>
    <li> This is the best nail clipper in existence for babies. Don&#x27;t bother with the traditional clipper. Save yourself time and energy and get this thing or register for it!!!! I am so glad I trusted the advice here on Amazon and got these. They are sharp but not dangerous. They are precise and allow you to cut to the curve of your child&#x27;s fingernail. You&#x27;re less likely to need to file the fingernails after cutting than with the traditional cutter. I have NEVER cut my daughter&#x27;s finger with these things!!! They are so safe and easy to use. The set comes with a nail file, but honestly we&#x27;ve never needed it.  These are also fantastic with the toenails.</li>
    <li> My baby scratches a lot and can often break his skin. This is the best scissors to get the nail super short. Drag down on the flesh, and slide/trim the nail flushed against the flesh with the scissor tip pointing outward. I almost never nips the flesh.</li>
    <li> Compared to other baby scissors, these have thin blades (with rounded ends) which work much better than other thick&#x27;n&#x27;dull kid scissors I&#x27;ve replaced.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Daughter in-law to use on our grand daughter. She loves them! Much better than baby clippers, you can see what you are cutting.</li>
    <li> I love these so much more than the little clippers for baby nails. I use them on my infant and my 5 year old. They work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these scissors for a couple weeks on my 6 week old baby&#x27;s teeny fingernails. I first tried baby nail files - which was extremely time consuming and not that effective. With these scissors I can clip the nails quickly - usually when she&#x27;s in a milk coma! I haven&#x27;t tried baby nail clippers and I don&#x27;t think I will - seems like it&#x27;s too easy to clip the fingertip. Satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!! I hardly ever write reviews for things, much less something so small. This thing is amazing. It makes it soo easy to cut my baby&#x27;s nails (and my 2 and 3 year olds also). With three kids, I have tried so many products- don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever found something that I was truly thrilled with until now.</li>
    <li> When my daughter was little I had an inexpensive pair of nail scissors for babies that I used to trim her sharp fingernails.  When my granddaughter was born 4 years ago, I bought these Tweezerman Nail Scissors for my daughter, even though I found them incredibly expensive.  Let me tell you, they were worth every penny.  My second granddaughter is due in a few months, and I am going to be buying a second pair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could never use the typical nail clippers successfully, even the smaller clippers made for babies.  It seemed I was always nipping her skin, or the nails would still be sharp when I was finished.  These scissor allow me to trim the fingernail in one easy swooping motion, cutting them in an arc shape instead of a straight line like with the clippers.  They are very sharp but I have never cut myself or my granddaughter while using them.  I can get a real nice grip while holding these too.  If they prevent just one cut on my grandkids fingers they are worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting little finger nails! - I like the rubber handles and the smallness of the design - they are great for cutting children&#x27;s finger nails Highly recommend worth the money!</li>
    <li> Use it for all 3 kids and they really don&#x27;t seem to mind me doing their nails. Granted, none like to be stationary, but the curved nature of the blade and grippy handle part make it as quick as it can get. They&#x27;re durable, sharp and easy to use. We tried the buzz-b or whatever that vibrating/rotating do-hickey was and the result was dreadful. The kids abhorred it and it didn&#x27;t do a great job. The scissors seem intimidating, but like everything else, do it a few times on your spouse/friend/mannequin and you&#x27;ll be comfortable. Ordering these as gifts for new mom friends of mine, so you know they&#x27;re highly recommended!</li>
    <li> works great!! 4 years now and I&#x27;m still using it!</li>
    <li> These scissors made trimming babies nails much faster and easier. Took me a few try to get hang of it. Sturdy with a rounded tip and sharp but not so sharp that you have to worry about unnecessarily trimming babies delicate skin. Glad I spend the $20</li>
    <li> The best scissors for tiny baby&#x27;s nails! We have tried other products, but this is a keeper. Yes, it&#x27;s not cheap like other clippers and scissors, but so worth every penny. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money with other baby scissors (like I did).  These are the best, though you can find the whole Tweezerman Children&#x27;s Kit for less money than this.  (Look at the big online drug stores.)</li>
    <li> Makes cutting my baby&#x27;s nails easier although it&#x27;s still nerve racking. Good product</li>
    <li> Started using it when my baby was 2-week old because he was scratching his face with his nails and the mittens were always falling.</li>
    <li> These scissors are sharp enough to trim my 10-month-old daughter&#x27;s nails, but not so sharp as to be too dangerous.  The rounded end is a good safety measure.  I wish these came with a cap or case, though, if only to make it easier and safer to carry these around and quickly cover them if my daughter gets too fidgety.</li>
    <li> Why, oh why, didn&#x27;t I just buy them to begin with?  After trying clippers when she was a tiny baby, then moving to the cheapie nail scissors, I stumbles upon these.  She didn&#x27;t even fuss when I did it!  Very smooth and easy to handle.  Totally worth the investment.</li>
    <li> perfect for tiny baby nails and toenails!</li>
    <li> Both inside and outside the box. The scissors work well though. Careless package but great product. Siba seems equivalent and is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> The first few weeks after my baby girl was born, I barely trimmed her nails at all, I was so terrified. They would get long and she would scratch herself, but I had such a hard time using the nail clippers and would always cut her or was so scared to that I wouldn&#x27;t ever get much clipped off. Nail files were a joke. I am SO glad I stumbled on these. They are sharp, precise and I think it would actually be pretty difficult to cut your baby&#x27;s finger with these. Such a relief! My only gripe (and its not a big enough one to change my rating) is they are pretty ugly and I wish they came in cuter colors/patterns. Oh well, for how well they work I&#x27;m not too concerned about that!</li>
    <li> These are beautifully designed.  I bought them for my grandson.  They take all of the stress out of trimming nails.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these scissors.</li>
    <li> Tired of biting those tiny nails?  Are you always afraid of snipping off the end of your baby&#x27;s finger?  Well this worked wonderfully for me, I absolutely love these nail scissors.  Just put the curve of the blade away from the finger and you can get a close cut everytime.</li>
    <li> I love these nail scissors! I only wish that I had bought them earlier, because I was scared (okay, terrified!) of clipping my baby&#x27;s nails with baby nail clippers, and even cut her with the clippers once :(  With these, my husband practically stands on his head and does an entire dance routine while I cut her nails. Easy peasy! I only wish they weren&#x27;t so colorful and cute; my daughter ALWAYS tries to pull them out of my grasp and play with them.</li>
    <li> I love these baby scissors.  I started using them when my baby was only a few weeks old, now she is 4 months and they still work great.  Never had any problems or accidental cuts with these scissors.  The do a great job at cutting nails and I like that an emory board was included.  My only suggestion would be to have them available in other colors, I&#x27;m not a fan of the animal print.</li>
    <li> Works great when cutting baby&#x27;s nails, while she sleeps.&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy. Cannot say anything bad about this scissor.&lt;br /&gt;Done.</li>
    <li> I got a pair of these scissors for my baby boy 38 years ago and am still using them. They have cut paper, wire, plastic, hair, foil ... oh and also fingernails! So I purchased these as a shower gift for a friend. Good investment instead of several pairs of cheapies that never work anyway.</li>
    <li> We forgot our Rubis Switzerland Baby Nail Scissors at the hotel and decided to buy the Tweezerman baby nail scissors instead because it&#x27;s half the price.  To my defense, I thought that it was cheaper because it didn&#x27;t have the cute elephant case. Turns out I was wrong.  There is no comparison between these two products.  I used it a couple of days ago on my 4.5 yr old boy and it took me double the time to cut his nails, not to mention that the final result didn&#x27;t look that great.  I just re-ordered the Rubis scissors yesterday.</li>
    <li> Never disappointed with tweezerman! Got these for my mom, because my dad used her old (non-tweezerman) ones to cut non-nail things and broke them. She likes the funky color, because it helps her find them in the drawer.</li>
    <li> I was very scared to cut my newborn&#x27;s nails, and a friend with a new baby recommended this over the baby clippers that I originally picked for the registry. These are really great: sharp enough for newborn&#x27;s nails (that feel like plastic wrap and very very bendable), but the edges are rounded so they are very safe. I haven&#x27;t tried the file that came with it as these haver really been all that&#x27;s needed. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I shipped them off to tweezerman and they either fixed or replaced them (honestly not quite sure)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to pay for the shipping but that&#x27;s better than spending 20 bucks on a new pair of scissors ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these and really liked them the first few times I used them and then I noticed they became harder to use. I just realized today that every time they are opened the screw holding the two scissor halves together loosens a little bit. I tried tightening it and it still just kept loosening each time the scissors were used.</li>
    <li> I use those to clip my infants nails. After a long research and several pairs of scissors that I bought and returned, these are the best!&lt;br /&gt;They are thin and sharp enough to get those tiny nails, and not as sharp at the tip, so they are as safe as it gets.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best baby products that I have purchased. Before this, it was soooo hard to cut my son&#x27;s nails and I was always scared that I would accidentally cut him. But these are great because they are very sharp and extremely slim, so they easily fit in between their nail and delicate skin. Their slimness is what makes them so much better than other products.</li>
    <li> Would recommend! Makes cutting babies nails so much easier! Never tried clippers because I&#x27;ve heard you could cut baby. These are very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Makes nails cutting a breeze. Love the rounded corner since it prevents my baby from getting stabbed.  Definately recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love these for cutting my toddlers&#x27; fingernails... only improvement would be if they could do it without her wiggling so much!</li>
    <li> we have tried many other baby nail scissors but none come close to these. they get super close without cutting the skin, we are able to cut her nails when she is asleep no fussing around. we reordered 2 additional pairs for travel and a backup.</li>
    <li> Great scissors for my baby&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, would recommend this product for purchase&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to cut babynails now!</li>
    <li> Nail trimming my infant was very stressful before someone recommended these to me. Now it&#x27;s a breeze!</li>
    <li> 2.5 years after buying it, it&#x27;s still working as excellently as when I originally purchased. A must for young kids. Top quality.</li>
    <li> I have to wait for her to fall asleep or a war will break out, but I have not once cut her little skins like i do with clippers.</li>
    <li> I have told my friends about these...I love them...I even posted a picture of them on Facebook and recommended them to all of my mommy friends.  Hopefully others will purchase them and have the same absolute satisfaction I have...they are much easier than clippers for me. I used to nick my older son&#x27;s little fingers with clippers. ...found some cheap scissors that worked pretty well...but have widened up bow for my second son and spent a bit more money and got an excellent product. .no nicks yet (he&#x27;s almost 4 months!)</li>
    <li> They are sharp but the metal is too thick so the nails remain long. Returned these.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I have twins and litt le time to cut nails. Th is let&#x27;s me cut the nails with ease. The blades are turned up so there&#x27;s less of a chance of cutting their fingers. I can even do it while they are awake. I would highly recommend them!!!</li>
