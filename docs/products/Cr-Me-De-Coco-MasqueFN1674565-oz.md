      <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>

      <li>Use it all the time and love it for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair healthy, full of body and shine.  </li>
      <li>Overall, even though this product is great, I have been using it for years, it smells wonderful, and it untangles my persistent dred at the nape of my neck, the health risk over prolonged use isn&#x27;t worth it to me, personally.</li>
      <li>I decided to try the creme de coco masque as a deep conditioner and it is an excellent product and you can see the difference after the first use.  </li>
      <li>I love Bumble and Bumble products and then I came across the Creme de Coco Masque on the internet and someone had written such an amazing review that I decided to try it</li>

      <li>it makes my hair nice and soft and also gives a shine to</li>
      <li>I enjoy the Masque very much.  </li>

      <li>right until I use this mask&lt;br</li>
      <li>For all of my cosmetic purchases, I check out the Cosmetic Cop&#x27;s review, first.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind this product, but I&#x27;ve definitely had better.</li>
      <li>As a regular condtioner it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>This is not the first time I&#x27;m buying this mask!&lt;br</li>
      <li>She gave this product a pretty stellar review.  </li>

      <li>I have very curly hair and</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This stuff is wonderful if you have thick hair that you blow dry and flat iron.</li>
      <li>This product makes your hair feel really soft right after you use it, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>using it three times a week, keep it on my hair while shower and the result is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing can restore my hair completely now, but I&#x27;m still not ready to cut it off, so Creme De Coco is the only mask which makes my hair looks like hair and not like an old cheap synthetic cosmetic brush!</li>
      <li>I love all B&amp;B products and this hair mask keeps my hair healthy and prevents my extremely long and thick wavy hair from getting too dry.</li>

      <li>Even while rinsing,  I could feel my hair was already soft.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t de-tangle my hair and didn&#x27;t leave it feeling soft...</li>
      <li>I trust B&amp;B products completely.  </li>
      <li>I expected more from this product seeing how much you have to pay for a small tube.</li>
      <li>And my issue to for being a sucker and buying such a tiny container of hair product based on the brand and reviews by people who are already blessed with nice hair.</li>
      <li>This product left my hair very shiny, but I don&#x27;t think it does enough for a masque treatment.</li>

<li> This product left my hair very shiny, but I don&#x27;t think it does enough for a masque treatment.</li>
<li> I know it said 7 minutes, but my hair is pretty thick and has been resistant to dye</li>
<li> I actually keep it my hair like a leave in conditioner and put it on after showering when my hair is still wet and wear it in my hair throughout the day.</li>
<li> I have long hair and the ends get really dry in the winter time.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find a hair product - especially a conditioner - that really works.  </li>
<li> Having hair dry as hay lately,  I tried this out and left it on my hair for an hour.</li>
<li> It softens it and keeps the flyaways down.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bleached my hair few months ago and now I have a chaos on my head…</li>
<li> It just felt like my hair texture changed with it, like it made it feel stiff.</li>
<li> this product help to tame it some.</li>
<li> Alas, my hair still feels dry like straw and breaks off.</li>
<li> I usually use it once a week,  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair clumpy or hard at all.</li>
<li> My hair is fantastically silky, smells terrific and doesn&#x27;t look frizzy or dry - even in the nasty winter weather.  </li>
<li> I use this along with my BB(medium to thick) curl creme!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I enjoy the Masque very much.  I usually use it once a week,  it makes my hair nice and soft and also gives a shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I have used this product since 2008  when I lived in S.C.  I highly recommend it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  K. H.</li>
    <li> For all of my cosmetic purchases, I check out the Cosmetic Cop&#x27;s review, first.  She gave this product a pretty stellar review.  It&#x27;s so difficult to find a hair product - especially a conditioner - that really works.  I&#x27;m happy to say that this masque is worth buying.  My hair is fantastically silky, smells terrific and doesn&#x27;t look frizzy or dry - even in the nasty winter weather.  Buy this masque; it actually works.</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful! My hair was very light and silky! The packaging is great to take on trips. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Although I love this product, it contains Phenoxyethanol and Limonene. Phenoxyethanol is linked to developmental toxicity, reproductive toxicity, skin or sense organ toxicity, and has been restricted for use in cosmetics in Japan. It also contains Limonene which is suspected of causing immunotoxicity, kidney toxicity, skin or sense organ toxicity, and may cause contact-allergy reactions in fragrance-sensitive consumers. Overall, even though this product is great, I have been using it for years, it smells wonderful, and it untangles my persistent dred at the nape of my neck, the health risk over prolonged use isn&#x27;t worth it to me, personally.</li>
    <li> I love Bumble and Bumble products and then I came across the Creme de Coco Masque on the internet and someone had written such an amazing review that I decided to try it and I did not regret it, it is amazing on my hair, I use it once a week and my hair feels and smells wonderful. I leave it on for about an hour, do some chores around the house and voilá, my hair is softer and more moisturised than if I had gone to a salon for a treatment!!!</li>

    <li> This product makes your hair feel really soft right after you use it, but it doesn&#x27;t last. I expected more from this product seeing how much you have to pay for a small tube.</li>
    <li> It got delivered pretty  quick.  And it smells divine!  It works wonderfully to condition my curls!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks!  (which means I&#x27;ve used it twice)  I got compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  mind you I use this along with my BB(medium to thick) curl creme!  Which is AWESOME!</li>

    <li> Not as great as I remembered. In comparison to the Pureology  mask, this comes in last. Didn&#x27;t de-tangle my hair and didn&#x27;t leave it feeling soft...didn&#x27;t seal the ends of my hair like the Pureolgy hair mask does.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful if you have thick hair that you blow dry and flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 3 weeks ago after seeing it reviewed in Real Simple magazine.  I absolutely love it!  I have long hair and the ends get really dry in the winter time.  this makes my hair so soft.  I use it about once a week.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this!!</li>
    <li> I thought that my hair would feel salon perfect after using this product. Alas, my hair still feels dry like straw and breaks off. I do love the smell. The item seems overpriced. That is not Amazon&#x27;s fault, that would be Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s issue. And my issue to for being a sucker and buying such a tiny container of hair product based on the brand and reviews by people who are already blessed with nice hair. I have been using this hair for the recommended time each time I use it. Perhaps over repeated uses I will come to realize that this product is a miracle?</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the only thing that makes my frizzy hair smooth and silky.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I&#x27;m buying this mask!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bleached my hair few months ago and now I have a chaos on my head… right until I use this mask&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it three times a week, keep it on my hair while shower and the result is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing can restore my hair completely now, but I&#x27;m still not ready to cut it off, so Creme De Coco is the only mask which makes my hair looks like hair and not like an old cheap synthetic cosmetic brush!</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind this product, but I&#x27;ve definitely had better. It just felt like my hair texture changed with it, like it made it feel stiff. The masque I use now I love and it is made by Beverly Hills. Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/Beverly-Hills-Masque-Treatment-12oz/dp/B0013BRXNC</li>
