    <li> Great light and bright with no glare</li>
    <li> Mi wife so happy cause fit excellent!! Great productos!</li>
    <li> I love this lamp.  It is so convenient to have it attached to my nail lamp.  No extra mess on my work station.</li>
    <li> It got her quick and works perfectly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The wife absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> The lamp is not stable it moves around</li>
    <li> Simply awesome. Just the right amount of light. Also love the fact that it saves table space.</li>
    <li> Why did I not search for this lamp months ago?!?! I love it!!!!! It works great and it&#x27;s bright. If you&#x27;re doing nail art, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem at all with seeing details. It&#x27;s cheaper ($20 less) than at the wholesale beauty supply stores I go to. I use it even when I&#x27;m not doing GelColor on my clients because our salon have weird lightings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick! I believe I received it within three days...priority mail...free shipping! Thank you for your service!</li>
    <li> I am really disappoimted—in myself.  I never found out it this works. It is only a lamp that will attach to an opi led lamp. I assumed (incorrectly) that it could work with any led lamp—that it had its own base.  Not the case.  I should have read the description better.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a low rating to catch the eyes of people like me who skim the descriptions and read the ratings closely.</li>
    <li> This light is great to declutter your work station the light attaches to the opi led lamp and plus in the back - hence the two plugs back there so no extra cords to trip on! Also the light is a true white so it keeps the true color or the polish and skin instead of adding yellow hues to it like normal lights</li>
    <li> This lamp is great. Makes it so much easier to see when doing a gel mani. It didn&#x27;t take long to come in either.</li>

    <li> Adding this to the purchase of the LED Curing Lamp was a great idea.  It is very cheap and provides a ton of light.

It doesn&#x27;t always hold in the position you expect it to stay in.  In a flat, horizontal position, like shown in the product pictures, there is no problems.  Try to aim it higher or lower and it won&#x27;t stay.</li>
