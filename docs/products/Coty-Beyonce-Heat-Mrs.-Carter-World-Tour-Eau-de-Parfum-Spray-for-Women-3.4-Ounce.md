      <li>This smells amazing and</li>
      <li>I liked this fragrance</li>
      <li>Very sweet!.</li>
      <li>Her best scent thus far.</li>
      <li>; which is a very CHEAP mock of &amp;#34;Midnight Fantasy&amp;#34; from Britney and now this.</li>
      <li>I love to collect perfume bottles.</li>
      <li>love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have all of Beyoncé&#x27;s fragrances and I am satisfied with them all.  </li>
      <li>Will be buying more of this.</li>
      <li>However, this particular scent is officially my favorite out of her Heat collection!</li>

      <li>Scent smells great and is not extremely strong.</li>
      <li>First there was &amp;</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice and  milder than her other signature fragrances yet lite but a pretty fragances, youthful...</li>
      <li>Very tyipcal of Beyonce to copy yet another fragrance from Britney Spears.</li>
      <li>First the perfumes have the same notes, but for some stranger reason Britney&#x27;s last longer and smells a lot better (hmmm) and also she copied Britney with the &amp;#34;Carter World Tour&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a strong perfume which is what I love about it.</li>
      <li>If the perfumes smelled different with different notes I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem, but this is just too similar to ignore how Beyonce can not be original in anthing she does.</li>

    <li> I bought this fragrance without knowing how it smelled. It is a fresh and wonderful scent. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent girlfriend loved it</li>
    <li> Scent doesnt last that long. Great summer scent though, would recommend to a friend because its a great smelling scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  I was very happy that she loved it.  It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> When I saw this perfume I knew I had to have it! I went and saw her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Atlanta This smells amazing and the scent last all day on me! I love it!.. The vender who sells this is also great b/c they shipped this and had it delivered to me before Christmas!!!</li>
    <li> Excelent. Very sweet!.</li>
    <li> The scent does not last an 8 hour workday! My boyfriend loves it as well as I but by the end of the workday I cant smell it at all :(</li>
    <li> Bought this without knowing what it smells like. Lasts a little longer than her previous scents. If you put enough of it on, you will attract some compliments. Not something I would purchase again though.</li>
    <li> I liked this fragrance it&#x27;s nice and  milder than her other signature fragrances yet lite but a pretty fragances, youthful... the only downside is that it has to be reapplied often.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this scent existed.  I took a chance and purchased it without smelling. I have all of Beyoncé&#x27;s fragrances and I am satisfied with them all.  However, this particular scent is officially my favorite out of her Heat collection!</li>
    <li> Very tyipcal of Beyonce to copy yet another fragrance from Britney Spears. First there was &amp;#34;Midnight Heat&amp;#34; which is a very CHEAP mock of &amp;#34;Midnight Fantasy&amp;#34; from Britney and now this. First the perfumes have the same notes, but for some stranger reason Britney&#x27;s last longer and smells a lot better (hmmm) and also she copied Britney with the &amp;#34;Carter World Tour&amp;#34; edition which Britney has &amp;#34;Circus Fantasy&amp;#34; which is from her Circus Tour and the bottle is the same freaking COLOR! If the perfumes smelled different with different notes I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem, but this is just too similar to ignore how Beyonce can not be original in anthing she does.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like at all the smell only last for four, mins</li>
    <li> Was a gift and the recipient lived it!</li>
    <li> Her best scent thus far. Will be buying more of this. Scent smells great and is not extremely strong. A+++++</li>
    <li> This perfume is great for summer, spring and fall. It&#x27;s very summer sexy to me. It&#x27;s not a strong perfume which is what I love about it. The bottle is very pretty. I love to collect perfume bottles. This one is worth collecting.</li>
    <li> love this fragrance. I think it&#x27;s one of the best from the heat collection</li>
    <li> Beyonce has another winner. Beautiful, light and sexy fragrance for the everyday woman. Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I LUV IT! SMELLS NICE!</li>
