      <li>I only buy from Bare Minerals, best makeup out there in my opinion!</li>
      <li>I received a full size of this mascara in a bareminerals kit, expecting to like it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve probably tried close to 10 in the last six months, and I&#x27;ve found a lot that I liked, but I haven&#x27;t found one I loved enough to use it exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really appreciate this aspect because i think it easily gets in-between my lashes and coats them all the way around</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this mascara, and at first I did....</li>
      <li>It works great to lengthen and shape lashes without a clumpy mess.</li>

      <li>This would definitely need two to three coats for this to be effective.  </li>
      <li>Her eyelashes looked so perfect that I thought they were false.  </li>
      <li>I love bare minerals</li>
      <li>I have oily lids so that may be the problem but for this kind of money I was hoping it would at least stay put better than some of the drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>I was drawn to this particular brand because of its rating on EWG.org, the fact that it is vegan, and cruelty free, and uses pure ingredients.  </li>
      <li>The downside is the brush is really fat!</li>
      <li>At first I was hesitate to get this mascara..</li>
      <li>In my eye, under bottom lash, above my top lash... everywhere.</li>
      <li>One to two coats is really all I need and my lashes are nicely coated, look thicker and longer and slightly curled without the help of a lash curler.</li>

      <li>So that&#x27;s really a 3-in-1, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and I paid so much for that.</li>
      <li>but I really like the volume &amp; lengthening that it gives to my lashes.</li>
      <li>fast shipping and sealed very well.</li>
      <li>I gave it a shot for a week straight and not once did I like it.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert, and our summer heat will pretty much melt off any makeup.  </li>
      <li>Ok so I am a major mascara lover, its the only thing I use</li>
      <li>I usually wear the Flawless Definition mascara by Bare Minerals, but I now wear this for a more dramatic look.</li>
      <li>My lashes never looked better than when i use this and their other volumizing mascara!</li>
      <li>I love full thick lashes and this provides them!  </li>
      <li>Though this mascara runs a little, I love everything else about it.  </li>
      <li>Makes my lashes look 3 times as long and full.</li>
      <li>because I had tryed many others that didnt give me the results I was looking for ( volume, boldness, less clumping, natural look that this mascara gives me ..</li>
      <li>The down side is, it&#x27;s not waterproof, and it rubs off really easy.</li>
      <li>Any other cheap mascara would work just as well.</li>
      <li>I agree with the other reviewers, this mascara makes my lashes look fabulous.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really wanted to love this mascara, and at first I did.... But, after the first couple of uses there are so many clumps in the mascara.... it takes me longer than it should to finish my makeup now because I spend so much time trying to get clumps out of my lashes...</li>
    <li> Very bold black, goes on smoothly without a lot of clumping (but it&#x27;s new.... that may change as it dries out more and more).  My only complaint is that it rubs off so easily.  I have very long lashes on deep-set eyes and several times in the day I have to wipe smudges off my upper lids from where they mascara has rubbed off when my lashes brush my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is interesting and it works well on my lashes.  But it is pretty big - I imagine anyone with small lashes and eye-space might have problems with such a big brush.</li>
    <li> Always love better lashes</li>
    <li> It does volumize, but runs very easily.</li>
    <li> I use mostly bare minerals make up products, this is the second mascara I have used from them. It works great to lengthen and shape lashes without a clumpy mess.</li>
    <li> I love the butterfly wand. This mascara really brings out my lashes. I am a makeup junkie (Sephora VIB Rouge) and I love, love, love this mascara.</li>
    <li> Though this mascara runs a little, I love everything else about it.  I live in the desert, and our summer heat will pretty much melt off any makeup.  I was drawn to this particular brand because of its rating on EWG.org, the fact that it is vegan, and cruelty free, and uses pure ingredients.  I love the volume this mascara gives.  I&#x27;m a gal who loves dramatic, full, lashes and this gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  I have bought it for myself and daughter several times.</li>
    <li> Too Gloppy! goes on in clumps. Ugh</li>
    <li> Never using anything else again.  I love full thick lashes and this provides them!  It also has a great EWG rating!!</li>
    <li> I really, really like this mascara. It goes on really easily, it&#x27;s thick but not clumpy, and if you twist the wand it really does separate your lashes. I usually wear the Flawless Definition mascara by Bare Minerals, but I now wear this for a more dramatic look. The downside is the brush is really fat! I have large eyes and fairly long lashes, and I had to be careful not to get this all over my brow. If you have small eyes or short lashes, this product might not work for you. The good news is most high-end cosmetics retailers have excellent return policies if you are not satisfied. Which brings me to my second point...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara retails in Ulta, Sephora and bareminerals boutiques for $18.00, so I recommend buying it at one of those places if you have one nearby as it is listed at $19.00 here. As a side note, I am also wary of purchasing any cosmetics from Amazon that are not featured in their new Luxury Beauty store, as counterfeit cosmetics can be a problem.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I needed more fullness in my lashes.  It does that quite well. I will probably purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Unless you already have long lashes, this will do nothing.  Also, if you follow website tutorial on lower lash application, it smears under your eye no matter how careful you are...and is very difficult to remove from your skin.  I had to reapply all my under eye makeup completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little confused about the 10-in-1 bit here but this is a decent enough mascara. The  brush is a bit strange and twisted but I just use it like a regular wand and wiggle it at the base of the lashes and work it through to the tips. One to two coats is really all I need and my lashes are nicely coated, look thicker and longer and slightly curled without the help of a lash curler. So that&#x27;s really a 3-in-1, isn&#x27;t it? I must be missing something, 7 somethings  . . . The only negative here is that it smudges on to my brow bone which is embarrassing when I look in the mirror hours later and realize I have black smudges under my brows. I have oily lids so that may be the problem but for this kind of money I was hoping it would at least stay put better than some of the drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve tried (all of which do the same thing).</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever had the misfortune of using. I received a free sample from Ulta when I bought another Bare Minerals foundation, and I was EXCITED to try it! I had used BM mascara in the past (several years ago) and really liked it, but opted for a drugstore brand instead because it was easier to buy and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I was super excited to try it this morning, but the brush and product are both equally awful. The brush is this weird spiral staircase design, so it requires multiple passes to coat the lashes, and the product RUNS! I ended up with mascara EVERYWHERE! In my eye, under bottom lash, above my top lash... everywhere. Then, to top it off, the stuff was near impossible to remove.&lt;br /&gt;I know how to apply mascara, and have been doing so for over a decade. My regular mascara is CG LashBlast Fusion Waterproof and I have never had this issue before... the waterproof mascara was even easier to remove than this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, the brush and product are both just awful, making for a difficult to use and remove product. I will definitely not be buying this product ever.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers, this mascara makes my lashes look fabulous. The draw back is I have black smudges under my eyes every time I use it so to me its not worth it. Some times I try putting on a coat of my waterproof mascara over it but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it didn&#x27;t smudge, then it would be perfect. I do love the way it makes my lashes look.</li>
    <li> I lovee this product, it is my favorite mascara</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used and I would never buy it again.  My biggest complaint is that it smears very easily in use.  Went to lunch with a friend, laughing together, and before lunch was over I had mascara on my eyelids and below the eye, just from my eyes being moist from laughter.  I&#x27;d hate to see what it would look life if I&#x27;d cried!  Also, the fibers tend to come off the brush in little clumps, which then land on your face and you have a mess to clean up.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the brush. The brush has hard bristles that don&#x27;t move. I really appreciate this aspect because i think it easily gets in-between my lashes and coats them all the way around and I think the hard bristles helps keep my lashes from sticking together. I think that separation is vital in the volumizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the formula. This mascara never comes off with water, which I really appreciate. I have to use face wash or make up remover in order to get this stuff off, so it lasts easily all day for me. The downside to that is when my lashes haven&#x27;t quite dried yet and the put some spots under my eyebrow, that is sometimes frustrating when I have already applied my eye make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: This week I played a soccer game in the pouring rain. After an hour of playing, my mascara was still fine and didn&#x27;t smear. I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have found to date .  Doesn&#x27;t clump like others do.  The application wand is a great design and also doesn&#x27;t get clumps.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried -- and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  I bought it at Ulta after the salesperson said it should be the answer to all my mascara &amp; eyelash problems.  Her eyelashes looked so perfect that I thought they were false.  She said she doesn&#x27;t even have to curl them with this mascara, and they were beautifully curled and very thick and perfect. When I tried it, I had so many globs I had to start over. I ended up with eyelashes that looked like little black sticks -- no thickening or lengthening, clumps instead of separating etc. etc.  Basically everything it says on the box was not the result I got.  The cheapest brand I&#x27;ve ever tried is better than this stuff, and I hope Ulta will refund my money.</li>
    <li> Too expensive and is clumpy.  Any other cheap mascara would work just as well.</li>
    <li> I am not loyal to any mascara.  I&#x27;ve probably tried close to 10 in the last six months, and I&#x27;ve found a lot that I liked, but I haven&#x27;t found one I loved enough to use it exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is pretty good.  It goes onto my eyelashes smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump.  It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes stick together.  It stays on all day without giving me raccoon eyes, and I can get it off with a little makeup remover at the end of the day.  It definitely coats my lashes and makes them thicker.  I don&#x27;t think it makes them look any longer, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this with success on both my top and bottom lashes.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the applicator.  The brush part is a twist or spiral and, for some reason, I almost always get mascara on my eyelid when I use this brush to put this on.  I would like this a lot more if it didn&#x27;t have a helix-shaped applicator.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara but I was so sad to open it up and find that it was trial size and I paid so much for that. pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> the best I have ever used. Love it</li>
    <li> Gave it to my daughter as I couldn&#x27;t wear it</li>
    <li> Great for volumous lashes! Makes my lashes look 3 times as long and full. I also like how this mascara is not toxic or bad for your eyelashes. It comes off easily with towelette wipes or makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I usually use the flawless definition and should have stuck with it. This is clumpy and smears easily. I also found that this would flake into my eyes and as a contact wearer, this was very annoying.</li>
    <li> Difficult to apply with spiral brush.  Can be messy.  Like the formulation.</li>
    <li> Great mascara! Thick and not clumpy</li>
    <li> This. Is. My. New. Favorite. Mascara. I love bare minerals and I love the brush on this one. Really separates my lashes and the brush is long enough that is reaches all my lashes in one shot. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> still like Maybelline better</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara by far!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara! Seriously incredible stuff, and excellent for sensitive eyes! A bit expensive, but worth the price IMO. I highly recommend replacing this every 2-3 months at least, as it does start to get clumpy after a while (not to mention the obvious hygienic reasons to replace your makeup products regularly!)</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite masscara. I used to order it off sephora but it&#x27;s a little bit cheaper on Amazon. The wand takes a little getting used to but it does wonders for your lashes!</li>
    <li> Enjoyed it while using it. Really lengthens my lashes and I apply two coats with a light hand. Makes my eyelashes look very natural.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great. Alone it makes my eyes pop and eyelashes look longer. The down side is, it&#x27;s not waterproof, and it rubs off really easy. I constantly have mascara under my eyes. I still love it though</li>
    <li> I received a full size of this mascara in a bareminerals kit, expecting to like it.  The Flawless mascara is easy to apply and stays on okay, so I was expecting that if not better from this.  However, this mascara wand is bulky and hard to use, I consistently get it all over my skin while applying.  Once applied, and the excess wiped off, it looks okay.  BUT, but the end of the day, I have a large raccoon eye with mascara all over my lower eye area for a really sloppy look.  I do not have this problem with drug store brands.  Additionally, this stuff is really hard to remove with just water, which means I am stuck with raccoon eye unless I use some remover.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This stiff, hard plastic brush does not grab enough mascara to give you a good coat.  It also does not distribute the mascara well from the bottom of your lashes to the tips.  This would definitely need two to three coats for this to be effective.  I have found a number of much better mascaras for less than half the $18 that this costs.  I would not recommend Lash Domination.</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara, I&#x27;ve used so many kinds and this is one of my favorites. I guess it&#x27;s not for everyone but I really like the volume &amp; lengthening that it gives to my lashes. And it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.</li>
    <li> I really love this&lt;br /&gt;No smell&lt;br /&gt;Easy application&lt;br /&gt;Does not clump&lt;br /&gt;Just takes a little extra time to remove&lt;br /&gt;But I like that it lasts all day</li>
    <li> At first I was hesitate to get this mascara..because I had tryed many others that didnt give me the results I was looking for ( volume, boldness, less clumping, natural look that this mascara gives me ..at the end by far this product has been the best muscera ive came across... I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Good mascara; it lengthens and thickens lashes. The only downside, it does transfer to my brow bone after a long day, especially if it&#x27;s humid.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and sealed very well. happy customer 👍</li>
    <li> Some of the best mascara i have ever used, Creates a longer thicker lash. Will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> Awesome Mascara!! I only buy from Bare Minerals, best makeup out there in my opinion! My lashes never looked better than when i use this and their other volumizing mascara!</li>
    <li> Ok so I am a major mascara lover, its the only thing I use and I must say this is by far the worst. I gave it a shot for a week straight and not once did I like it. It smears too easily, made my eyes a little itchy and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look long, just clumpy. I don&#x27;t recommend this to mascara lovers!</li>
    <li> Love this!! It goes on great!! It does not irritate my eyes.</li>
