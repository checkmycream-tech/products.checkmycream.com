<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love listening ve lol ve this! Shinyest nail Buffer EVER!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described and a quick cleanup to my nails. I dont like super gritty files and this is perfect to give yourself a clean look after cutting your names and having some jagged edges.</li>
    <li> Ordered a bunch of different brands and found this (and two others) to be the best of the lot....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the buffer 2-3 times and it works very well.  The shine is as bright as clear polish and stays on for days.</li>
    <li> Price is way out of line - the price-margin must be $,25 to make and the rest is CLEAR profit.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great for buffing and shining nails. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have brittle nails that tend to get jagged if I don&#x27;t keep them polished. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t always have time to do polish. This buffer keeps them smooth far longer than polish, so I can keep them from snagging and breaking on things even if I don&#x27;t have time to polish.     I also love its teardrop shape. I have difficulty holding onto small/thin objects and this design spared me that frustration.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my nails look, but it&#x27;s difficult for me to use.  I&#x27;d like it a lot more if it were narrower and longer.  I have a hard time sliding it back and forth across my nails.</li>
    <li> I am new to this brand of nail buffer. To my surprise, it provides a higher level of shine than others like it. I don&#x27;t know how it does its magic but I&#x27;ve got shiny nails now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other buffing things and this is spectacular.  It&#x27;s fast and it makes a really nice shine with no chemicals.  I&#x27;m so delighted not to wear nail polish any more.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about unsightly peeling polish even hours after a manicure and my nails feel so smooth.  Use the green (ruff) side first to smooth out ridges and then use the white side to shine them up.  It&#x27;s clean and chemical free.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Makes my home manicure look professional</li>
    <li> I was amazed - it works great and was so quick and easy.</li>
    <li> this product really works! I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see any advantage to using a 4 way buffer over this one. I never use the file down part on a 4 way buffer, as it&#x27;s easier just to use a nail file, making a 4 way buffer have only 3 real buffing sides to it. Apparently, based on using this one, that 3rd side is extraneous as this does just as good a job without it.</li>
    <li> REALLY BAD. I only used this one time and all the rough, buffer side peeled off. For $7, I was hoping for more than one use at the minimum. It did work great...until it started falling apart in the middle of buffing.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first as to if this actually works but it exceeded my expectations! Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I love these. I can no longer find them in the stores around me and was very happy to find them on amazon. They make my nails soooo shiney.</li>
    <li> works super fast. nails get super shiny. lasts for about 4 days. :)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Revlon Crazy Shine Nail Buffer from Giant Eagle.    It&#x27;s not the best nail buffer I&#x27;ve ever had, but it does what it claims. Using the green portion of the pad to smooth out the ridges on my nails is the part that took the longest, but that was no more than maybe 30&#x27;ish seconds per nail. The white side of the pad that polishes the nail to a glass shine much easier and faster, only taking a few seconds to bring my nails to a nice glossy glow.    I saw someone post a comment on here about how the buffer does not work, but I strongly suspect that the person was using it incorrectly. These buffers are actually fairly standard and there&#x27;s not much that you can get wrong about them.     That being said, I would like to make it clear that you use the rain-drop side of the buffer and not the edge. From the looks of it, the mid section is just some foam keeping the pads together and making it easier to hold versus the standard tongue-depressor style buffers. And as always, if in doubt read the instructions!    I gave this a 4 over all. It does what it claims and is relatively inexpensive, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about. I&#x27;m not sure about the product&#x27;s durability, though, as I&#x27;ve just purchased it.</li>
    <li> I do love this buffer!!!  You can have any level of shine you want and your nails are so smooth you want people to feel of them!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but a few buffs across the nails results in a brilliant shine for about 4 days. I went back and bought more as these will make great Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> This is a  terrific product. Love this.</li>
    <li> These work extremely well for a high gloss on your fingernails. There is no need for Polish after using these shine buffers. I swear by them.</li>
    <li> In my line of work, I can&#x27;t wear nail polish on the job, so I save it only for special occasions. However, I&#x27;d still like my nails to have a well-manicured look. That&#x27;s where these Revlon Crazy Shine Nail Buffers come in. Use them lightly, and you will have a shine that lasts for days, and there is no chipping like you&#x27;d get from a top-coat! As an extra benefit, when I use hand creme and massage it into my nails, it can actually penetrate without a layer of polish interfering. Also, there is no need for a chemical remover! What more can you say about a cheap, easy, and excellent product like this one? No drawbacks and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the person that received it was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> ~~~ Pros ~~~&lt;br /&gt;+ Good Shine for little effort, exceptional shine for greater effort&lt;br /&gt;+ Teardrop shape is easy to hold in the hand&lt;br /&gt;+ Cheap if you get in on sale at local drugstores/beauty shops&lt;br /&gt;+ Lasts a heck of a lot longer than clear polish&lt;br /&gt;+ Buffing (in general) is more practical than polish for those w/fast-growing nails&lt;br /&gt;+ The worn edges can be cut back using a razor blade to expose fresh buffing surfaces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~ Cons ~~~&lt;br /&gt;- Shine doesn&#x27;t last as long as other buffers&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively expensive on Amazon compared to local retailers (especially if you can find some during &#x27;Buy 1, get 1 50% off&#x27; sales or the like)</li>
    <li> The one side polishes off ridges and the second side buffs your nails and makes them shine like I&#x27;ve never seen.  My nails look as though I have clear nail polish on, but they&#x27;re buffed and natural instead.</li>
    <li> Works great to buff your nails to give them a great shine.</li>
    <li> Great nail buffer!  This is the best nail buffer I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves nails very shiny.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping but while it did, it gave a great shine!</li>
    <li> Works as represented.  Great shine!</li>
    <li> Buffer.  Great item.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I was able to use it twice and after that it was pretty much worthless. The shape is not very helpful either....</li>
    <li> This thing really works, I got it at a greatr price, and super fasr delivery.</li>
    <li> This worked very well as a nail buffer but fell apart really quickly. Most of the grit and the smooth coating on both sides is gone already after maybe 10 uses. Would be great if it was much cheaper and sold in bulk.</li>
    <li> This works great and is easy to use, It&#x27;s pretty amazing how smooth it makes your nails feel and how shiny it makes them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use it too much on my nails to even it out. Unlike some reviewers I don&#x27;t find it awkward to hold or use. I like the large area as opposed to other nail buffers. I tend not to use a lot of the other sides of other nail buffers so it has been really useful for me. The shine side lasted more than 3 days. If I remember it lasted 5 - 7 days. What I do is buff the nail, wash my hands, lotion, and after the lotion has dried shine my nails. They look fantastic even without polish.</li>
    <li> works great  gives a great shine</li>
    <li> Buffs your nails beautifully.  Good beauty product for the money. Your nails look amazing after you buff them.  Polish is not required to keep that shine going.</li>
    <li> produces good shine with little effort</li>
    <li> It worked but only a few times. Now the surfaces are worn down and they no longer buff. Very disappointed. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is nice and easy to use, or course all nail buffing takes a bit of elbow grease. I almost wish the shape was a bit smaller though.</li>
    <li> Super crazy shine is right - I spent a few seconds on each nail and it looked like I was wearing clear polish!  I washed the breakfast dishes afterwards, and the shine is still there.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but even if I have to do this daily, it&#x27;s no big deal.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This simple buffer does a superior job of shining natural nails. I thought I&#x27;d try a different and more expensive one, but it doesn&#x27;t work half as well as this one.</li>
    <li> Better than expected based on some of the reviews.  It works quickly.....awesome!</li>
    <li> So I can not wear nail polish on my nails. With my job my hands are constantly in water, so the polish doesn&#x27;t last a day. Gel polish is also out of questions because I keep my nails very short for performing the facials and cut them at least once a week. So I&#x27;m trying to keep my natural nails looking as good as possible and naturally I went through a number of nail buffers. So far I think this one is the best. The main advantage is that it&#x27;s only two steps. I&#x27;ve owned buffers that had as many as 4 sides!!! So obviously it took a whole lot of time. And by the time I had to do pinky on my right hand I was fed up with this process and did a sloppy job. Revlon crazy shine gives the result much faster. My nails were very shiny at the end. And the best part: even a few days later my nails still have a nice smooth sheen.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that of any nail buffer: with continuous use it will make your nails thinner.</li>
    <li> I can do my nails about twice with this before it&#x27;s too worn out to do any more. I&#x27;m looking at different options but so far this is the best shine.</li>
    <li> cheap, falls apart, tore first use, don&#x27;t buy...This looks like a jar of buffing cream and it&#x27;s just a buffing tool. No better than a 75 cent one from walmart, save your money</li>
    <li> I went out to Amazon looking for Revlon&#x27;s Shape-n-Buff for nails.  My local chain of drugstores stopped carrying this a few years ago and only sell a similar but very inferior product that wears out very quickly. I went to the Revlon website first to see if they still produced the Shape-n-buff and saw the Crazy Shine Nail Buffer.  So on a whim  while purchasing the Shape-n-Buff I bought the Crazy Shine.  I don&#x27;t know what the material is but it really, really works to bring an incredible shine to nails - far beyond the general buffer - and in a very short time. I did use the Revlon Shape-n-Buff first including smoothing my nails - but the crazy shine Buffer brought a shine that was quite incredible.  I&#x27;m not impressed by many nail or cosmetic products as results rarely live up to the hype but in this case - it&#x27;s true - it does produce a crazy shine in seconds.  Highly, highly recommended for anyone who does their own nails and those who  don&#x27;t wear polish a lot but want great looking nails.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I love, love, love it and highly recommend it.  I&#x27;m already planning to give it as a gift to my sisters and friends who often have &amp;#34;au naturel&amp;#34; nails.</li>
    <li> Great little nail buffer--really makes my nails smooth and shiny.  My nails are pretty enough to leave plain, but if I put on a coat of polish, it lasts a lot longer with my nails buffed first.</li>
    <li> This is the best product of its kind I have ever used. Quick, easy and wonderful results. I have plans to reorder. My nails are in terrible shape due to illness and medications. It is great not to have to use multiple products to make them look better!</li>
    <li> I love these things, but I cannot find them in any store in my area. I haven&#x27;t found a shine buffer that does what this thing does, now if only they made it in stick form, I would be so EXCITED. They make my nails super shiny and that seems to keep them from breaking as much. You just lightly sand down with a regular stick and buff out with the gentle but effective buffer side and then use the shine side quickly back and forth. I is so shiny and strong, very helpful since I am not allowed to wear nail polishes at work.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. Some concerns as to how long it will last.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, and she liked it since she&#x27;s low maintenance and doesn&#x27;t like painting, but these helped her to keep her nails shiny naturally.</li>
    <li> I love the &amp;#34;Revlon Crazy Shine Nail Buffer.&amp;#34;  It gives a fast, super shine, to my fingernails. It is the only buffer I have found with this result.  I have been unable to find it locally in the stores where I bought the buffer in the past.  I am so happy that it is available for purchase on amazon</li>
    <li> One of my favorites!! This duo of a front buffer and back slick shiner really does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;My nails sparkle and shine without any polish! Just beautiful, real fast results in just under 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at polishing, but the fabric ripped and bubbled after the first use. Will have to toss it out soon.</li>
    <li> The buffer gives amazing shine as it  has promised but the big tear drop shape makes it difficult to use the inside of the buffer. I wish they made two smaller product then one big one.</li>
    <li> If you want an inexpensive way to shine your nails I would definitely advise you to purchase.  Works great and fast.  Love this nail buffer - it really works well and you don&#x27;t have to pay alot of money to have nice shiney nails!</li>
    <li> They work great.  These buffers became unavailable at Kmart, so checking with Amazon seemed like the thing to do.  The shine from the buffer lasts for about 3 days depending on what you are doing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of buffers before - most heat your nail to the point it&#x27;s painful before you get a shine.  Not so with this great buffer!  Beautifully shining nails with very little effort!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Smaller and will not last long.</li>
    <li> The Revlon Crazy Shine Nail Buffer is fantastic.  I have always wanted pretty nails, but am not in the financial position to get a manicure.  I tried this and it is amazing how well it works.  Within minutes, i had shiny beautiful nails.  I am  not a fan of using nail polish, because I hate when it chips and I don&#x27;t have time to remove it.  This gives the glossy appearance of polished nails, and takes no time.  Love it!  I&#x27;m really glad to have found this handy little tool.  I love the manicured look it gives it.</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews over this product, I just had to try it.  The results I got were great, but after using it one time, the edges of the product were already completely worn out.  The design is all wrong, because after using the edges of the buffer, the middle of the it (probably 85% of the surface area!) is left unused because it is too cumbersome to do an efficient job - it is too big for precision and ends up eating away the surrounding skin.  The shining part is fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on the buffer to last past 2 uses at the most.  Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product gives my natural nails a great shine.</li>
    <li> These nail buffers work so well. My nails are really shiny for 3-4 days. It looks like clear nail polish, but doesn&#x27;t chip off. My nails look shiny &amp; healthy, even as the shine fades in a week.  I used to buy at Target &amp; they stopped carrying them, so now I buy online.</li>
    <li> The buffer leaves my nails looking healthy and shiny without using harsh nail products.</li>
    <li> I loved this buffer on first use.  I thought I had found my holy grail for nail buffers. (I am not allowed to wear polish at work.)  My nails were shiny like glass and it worked so great!  Shine lasted more than a week.  After that, I felt  like there was no shine result to my nail with the second or more use of the shining side.  The buffing side still has a lot of life.  Too expensive for a one-off.  I have had better luck with other products.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again. Disappointed.  I&#x27;d like to find the old-school chamois and buffing cream set.  That stuff worked every time.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this little gem last week and I am really impressed with the results.  It promises a shine that lasts for 3 days but the shine is still going strong after 5 days.  It looks like a high brilliant glossy topcoat.  Lasts through showering, washing dishes, etc,.  Totally worth it for those who want shiny natural looking nails without using polish.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The pros are that it&#x27;s easy to grip and it does indeed shine very well.  I might almost suspect it was impregnated with oil or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con is that I have ridged nails and the green side did nothing to help that.  In the end I resorted to my fine-grit emery board (Trim brand 2472) to buff away the ridges and then shined up the nails with the white side of the Revlon thing.  I may or may not reorder this; it&#x27;s completely a toss-up at this point.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel like a manicure at a salon or want to give my short nails time to breath then this item is my go to. Buffs, and a shine that lasts the whole day, love it.</li>
    <li> Works so well! It keeps my nails looking polished all the time! A must have!</li>
    <li> Perfect for those nails with ridges. One side smooths them out while the other buffs them to a beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, this really gives my nails a great shine. I love it!</li>
    <li> I keep it handy for any nail snags. I also take it in my purse. Then when I have time I use the buffer side to shine my nails. I don&#x27;t bother with polish anymore.</li>
    <li> I felt pretty silly paying over $5 for this thing (and not looking in stores for it first)  but I ordered it anyway because of the rave reviews. I&#x27;ve only used one other style buffer, that I can remember, the 4 colored one that is a block style and often sold at the Dollar Store...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a little comparison here. First off, this is definitely nicer in that it does not peel back after some use. I uploaded some photos so you can see how mine looks after a few weeks. I&#x27;ve used it every few days on my nails and once on my husband&#x27;s. Smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I love the shape and definitely feel that&#x27;s worth paying a bit more for. It is much easier to use and more comfortable to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 3 stars is that I thought the green filing side could be better, last longer, and the price, in my opinion, is too high...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a terrible habbit of removing my cuticles (don&#x27;t do it, lol!) so they grow back thicker and harder. When I remove them, a slight ridge is left in the nail bed, where they were (sorry, gross but gives you an idea if you have any ridges!)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the green side doesn&#x27;t really have enough grit to totally smooth ridges out and the side for shine is so amazing, every little ridge really stands out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference for both filing and smoothing out ridges is,  [[ASIN:B00I99PRD4 Set of 4 Quality Nail Art Manicure Crystal Glass Nail Files Buffers by Cheeky®]] . I feel these work much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the photo, you will see my husband&#x27;s buffed shiny nails and the green side of the buffer wearing away after a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still buy this product again and recommend it others. I do feel it would be better priced at around $3 max in my opinion and I&#x27;ll be looking for it in retail stores. Smile. Hope this is helpful!</li>
    <li> You want serious shine? This is legitimate. It doesn&#x27;t buff your nail down like other abrasive buffers either.</li>
    <li> This is a great buffer.  The shape makes it easy to hold and use.  I find it easier to use than any other buffer that I have used.  It works well making my nails shine.</li>
    <li> This buffer is amazing!  It really looks like a coat of clear nail polish and lasts for almost a week.</li>
    <li> Great nail buffer, fast and easy only two sides can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> It´s very good product. I liked so much it. I gave to my mother and she liked a lot of.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I actually wish it could be a bit stronger to get the ridges out. My nails are super shiny but if the coarse side could get rid of ridges more deeply, it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product. They named it right-- crazy shine!</li>
    <li> Best shine ever. I seriously can not tell if I have clear coat polish on or not. And it&#x27;s not like it fades fast. I have never had a buffer but my mom has one and hers does not do this, she wants one of these now. It&#x27;s pretty simple to use you just sand the ridges if you have any and just buff it with the white side. It will make that terrible squeaky sound like Styrofoam makes sometimes, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> This does EXACTLY what it claims. Only thing I can say is I could have gotten it at my local Walmart or Target for less.</li>
    <li> I used it and I love this product.  I buffed my nails and they look like I have clear nail polish on.  The nails are shiny and smooth.  Absolutely wonderful.  Worth getting.</li>
    <li> It gives a shine that lasts for a few days and it&#x27;s easy to do.</li>
    <li> Nice product for buffing nails.</li>
    <li> I have used plenty of shine buffers and this one is by far the best ever. Crazy good, crazy easy, crazy fast. A buffed shine lasts longer than polish for me. Clear Polish curls on the ends and peels back. This buffer, shiner is amazing! Thanks Revlon.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it supposed to do. I have used it a half dozen times over the last 2 months. The shine lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses it everyday</li>
    <li> nice size, came quickly, really buffs nails.  I like buffing them because it stimulate the nail, I don&#x27;t have to use polish either.  While I watch tv, or I am bored I buff my nails.  This is small enough I can do it at a boring meeting! (not business meeting)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I can carry it in my pocket, after a month the sides going in towards the middle would wear off but maybe that&#x27;s just me not taking care of it. i will be sitting down watching t.v. buffing my nails. but i would recommend to get the 4-way block instead for the cost and quality.</li>
    <li> It really makes your nails shine</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I used this immediately and it smoothed over some ridges, then in just seconds it buffed the nail to a shine that looked like polish.  Really nice.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shine but the pad wears out after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE!  Everyone thinks I use clear nail polish after I buff with these.  Shine lasts for weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps your nails very shiny and strong. And I do mean very shiny. Really works</li>
    <li> A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it. It does help with the process.But there is a limit. this is an item that I trust anyone who would purchase it knows what it does. Is an in-depth review necessary. Come on Amazon filter it so that reviews apply to a product that could actually benefit from one!!!!</li>
    <li> everything went as promised-delivery, packaging,product.  very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I could find this. I have had two in the past and wore them out.  It was expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I was expecting plain white with green, but mine came in leopard print! Even without that total bonus, this thing is high-quality and the buffed shine really does last for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated buying this because really - a buffing block, how exciting could it really be? I&#x27;m so glad gave it a try. I actually love the oversized style because it&#x27;s hard to lose track of and it&#x27;s comfortable to grip with your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea of slicing off a fresh edge, as another reviewer posted, and I plan to try that when the edges start to wear down.</li>
    <li> Good Buffer &amp; leaves a good shine.</li>
    <li> Bought this at a local CVS for around 4 bucks.  Works just as well as the stuff sold at the mall.  Note to manufacturer: this product could be improved if the mid section (the white foam filler) was lined with more buffing shiner or file.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I am a nursing student who is unable to have painted nails because of clinicals. It was very hard for me to come to terms with this because I am a huge nail polish fanatic and rarely have &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; nails. I was given this as a gift for Christmas because I hated the way my nails looked without polish. It works wonders! Within only a few seconds my nails look like they have a fresh wet clear coat on top. Perfect for having nice manicured looking nails without getting deducted points for having paint on your nails. The shine seems to hold up for several days, however; it does not last more than 2 or 3. And by 3 they are barely shiny. That may be because I have to wash my hands a thousand times a day when I am in the hospital. But honestly, who cares? This thing is so ergonomic, quick, and efficient that I would buff my nails at least once a day to get this shine if I had to. My only downside is that if you have any sharp edges on your nails the buffer can easily snag. I have only used it a dozen times so I don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up over a long period of time. Also, the price on amazon is much more expensive than what my local Ulta sells it for (just under $5). I&#x27;ve had other buffers that didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as this. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Cannot believe the shine on my nails...love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month or two and decided to write a review. I&#x27;m still using my first buffer, (Yes, it&#x27;s lasted that long. Keep in mind: I use the buffer about once every one or two weeks). I can say the buffer does, in fact, work. It&#x27;s just a bit awkward to buff your nails because of the shape. The round edges just make it harder to use, especially in the corners or the side of your fingernails (where the cuticles are). I found the buffing side takes a bit longer to use than the shine side. I like to get all of my nails (even the hard to reach areas). And since it&#x27;s a bit time consuming to do so, I only buff my nails when I decide to paint them or if my nails are looking dull. I also found that buffing them lets my polish stay on longer. For $6-7, I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying this buffer. It works just as well as the pricier ones sold in malls.</li>
    <li> I hate that the edges aren&#x27;t covered in buffing material.  It feels pretty flimsy.  Plus it didn&#x27;t really work.  I&#x27;d have to buff away on my nails for a couple of minutes each to really get good results.  Really don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> After working as a copywriter for an organic spa company, I swore off nail polish because of all the harmful chemicals that leach into the body through the nails. Buffing is the alternative I turned to in order to keep my nails looking pretty and shiny. This buffer works great! My nails keep their shine and look lovely without all of the danger of polish. I will be ordering them again and again.</li>
    <li> What an amazing little devise! With a bit of practice and patience I was able to produce quite a shine. This buffer is one&lt;br /&gt;to keep in the repertoire. Revlon, you delivered what you promised.</li>
    <li> Love this little tool</li>
    <li> A really nice nail buffer!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  It does exactly what it advertises.  My nails have never looked better!</li>
    <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s perfect, purse-sized and leaves my nails better-looking than what I start with in the morning.  : )</li>
    <li> This works as described.  Be aware you&#x27;re not getting two...the photo is to illustrate the two SIDES of ONE file.</li>
    <li> It does work for a bit, making your nails super smooth and shiny, but it seems to wear down really fast especially around the edges. Its shape is kind of awkward to use as well.</li>
    <li> Amazing &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; for pretty nails without liquid polish!  My husband could not believe that I had not applied clear nail polish after I used this buffer.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Use it twice and I&#x27;m no longer getting that shine i should.</li>
    <li> Not what the reviews say for sure.  Catches on rough nails and then gets scratched.  Better ones out there, pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> I have tried buffing my nails years ago, but it never seemed to make any difference.  Lately, though, I&#x27;ve had the notion of trying it again.  The drug store had no buffers, so I went on Amazon and chose this one due to reviews.  It came this afternoon.  I took it out of the package, gave my nail a few swipes, and WOW!  Instant shine!  I even went immediately to show my husband the difference.  I don&#x27;t know how this works, I only know that it does!  I&#x27;ve done all my nails now, and they look great!  I do too much housework for polish to last, and even clear polish can start to look ragged.  This is a step up from plain nails, without the problems that polish poses.  I highly recommend this buffer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Looks good just after doing but doesn&#x27;t last long. I used to have a product that was like a paste that you buffed on your nails and it lasted much longer.</li>
    <li> This lasted one time, and the drop design isn&#x27;t that helpful.  Invest a little more and get a Lippman buffer- they are a little pricey but last three to four times and do an amazing job.</li>
    <li> Wow. Super shiny nails! Other products were disappointing, but this one works. Love the corner tip for getting close to the corners and edges of my nails. Nice price too.</li>
    <li> Works great. Shines quickly.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple -- buff on one side, shine on the other. It really does give Crazy Shine. I saw this recommended elsewhere online and figured with the amount of accolades it got, there had to be something it. This really is a very good nail buffer.  The shine provided lasts for a day or two, and it&#x27;s easy to buff up the shine for the following day.  Feels sturdy and well-made, as nail buffers go, and has held up fairly well so far.  Good for women &amp; men who like shiny, well-groomed looking nails without having to use nail polish. Get some cuticle wax and you&#x27;re set.</li>
    <li> Use this every day. Great invention</li>
    <li> Really shines but does not last. Great for a quick shine before going out the door. Nice to have for emergencies</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many \\&quot;nail buffers\\&quot; at retail and online stores.  None really worked.... until REVLON&#x27;S CRAZY SHINE NAIL BUFFER.  It works as well as my professional manicure!!! ...at a fraction of the cost ... and NO TRAVELING involved.  At last....</li>
