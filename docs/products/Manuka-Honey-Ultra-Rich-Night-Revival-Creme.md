      <li>I love this cream!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks in conjunction with the skin blemish cream and both have been great.  </li>
      <li>This is a great night cream</li>
      <li>Yet is does a great job at moisturizing and protecting my skin.  </li>
      <li>The smell I love!!</li>
      <li>Very nice smell to use at night.</li>
      <li>It feels so good on your face.</li>
      <li>it feels good, absorbs well and skin looks good in the morning,</li>
      <li>and sure otherwise a great product.</li>
      <li>Love this cream!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Absolutely top notch!</li>
      <li>Very generous pot of delicious smelling night cream.</li>
      <li>Most of all it smells really good and with my newborn up close to my face</li>
      <li>it has a wonderful smell, non-sticky, absorbs easily and makes skin soft.</li>
      <li>Their hand creme is awesome, the facial cleanser gentle and excellent, and this nite cream SUPER.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Now that I use this cream, my skin behaves much better.</li>
      <li>also, most products have cheaped out and use mineral oil.</li>
      <li>At 55, I still have clog-happy pores, but the surface of my skin dries out, and I am pleased at the way this product helps both.</li>
      <li>Im glad I found this brand.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>I love this cream..</li>
      <li>but most all night creams are.</li>
      <li>It is nice and light,</li>
      <li>but I will buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>I will need to be ordering more.  </li>
      <li>Koru Naturals is a good compant to work with as well, and I am very pleased with all my Wild Fern Products.</li>
      <li>A light cream which smells pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Perfect consistency, nice and thick but not clogging.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I was able to find it on the Koru Naturals website.</li>
      <li>Easy to put on, lasts a long time, works very nicely.</li>
      <li>The night revival cream is rich without making you oily and does not cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>It does have fragrance in it, but it is light and fresh and does not bother my skin or my eyes.    </li>
      <li>The smell is strong when you first put it on but after a minute or two is gone.</li>
      <li>Goes on rich, soaks right in.</li>
      <li>Manuka honey, made from the Tea tree, has proven healing effects and is a favorite remedy in New Zealand.  </li>
      <li>However, it really smooths your skin and helps diminish fine lines and firms.</li>
      <li>You can notice how fresh your face will look in the morning.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>I just wish that Amazon sold the SPF 15 Manuka Honey Wild Ferns Day Moisturizer - that is quite possibly the best daily moisturizer I have ever found!</li>
      <li>The entire product line is top notch and worth every cent.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know whether Manuka honey really makes a tremendous difference, but I like using it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried other manuka honey creams and thought they worked great, even smelled nice, a little bit like...honey!</li>
      <li>I first used these NZ manuka products after visiting NZ in Feb 2007.  </li>
      <li>this does what it sez, it has made me skin look smooth, soft and not cleared pores, but not clogged.</li>
      <li>I put it on after a hot shower and I&#x27;m moist to go all day..</li>
      <li>Sure there is a fragrance when you first put it on, but it dissipates shortly after putting it on.</li>
      <li>Before I started using this, my combination skin looked dull and lines on my forehead were more prominent than ever</li>
      <li>better and dry patches are gone below my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer the Pure Source brand of manuka night cream.</li>
      <li>I even noticed that my makeup went on so much nicer.</li>
      <li>Koru ships fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this at both morning and night just because I can&#x27;t find a day time moisturizer that I like as much as this</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Intense, fruity, flowery smell, but natural not perfume-ey.</li>
      <li>(yeah, I&#x27;ll admit I agree with a previous reviewer, it does smell like old lady perfume), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger more than 30 seconds after application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll report back if this changes through the harsh winter weather but for now, I love this product!</li>
      <li>But this cream in particular smells like old lady perfume.</li>
      <li>I discovered Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Night Revival Cream while traveling in New Zealand.  </li>
      <li>Using Wild Ferns Gentle Cleanser and the Revival Cream have improved my skin&#x27;s texture and overall health to the point of invoking compliments from those who know me well.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B000UYF6G4 Manuka Honey Wild Ferns Night Revival Cream]]  </li>
      <li>For reference, I have 28-yr old biracial combination skin which still thinks it&#x27;s in high-school and breaks out on occasion.</li>
      <li>Ihave to take a dietetic every day and it leaves the skin with  a soft feeling.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and</li>
      <li>It is rejuvenating and it leaves the skin so soft.  </li>
      <li>i had only tried moisturizer at night a few times, because my face breaks out easily.</li>
      <li>I have normal to dry 40 year old skin.</li>
      <li>I recently discovered Manuka Honey Wild Ferns products on a recent trip to New Zealand, and I could not be happier.</li>
      <li>Here in Wisconsin where the winters are bitterly cold, you need a good face cream.</li>
      <li>I have normal to dry skin and think this is a keeper for me.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought the perfume was a little overpowering</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this cream. It moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy.  It is nice and light, just right.</li>
    <li> At first I thought the perfume was a little overpowering (yeah, I&#x27;ll admit I agree with a previous reviewer, it does smell like old lady perfume), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger more than 30 seconds after application. The cream works very well for me; I don&#x27;t wake up with dried out wrinkly skin anymore. For reference, I have 28-yr old biracial combination skin which still thinks it&#x27;s in high-school and breaks out on occasion. Now that I use this cream, my skin behaves much better. Try it; you will glow! I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell to use at night. Perfect consistency, nice and thick but not clogging. You can notice how fresh your face will look in the morning. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot per use but I will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! For a night cream, it is NOT at all heavy or greasy feeling. In some ways, you hardly know you have it on. Yet is does a great job at moisturizing and protecting my skin.  At 55, I still have clog-happy pores, but the surface of my skin dries out, and I am pleased at the way this product helps both. The manuka honey is key in this product for both its antibacterial and humectant properties. It does have fragrance in it, but it is light and fresh and does not bother my skin or my eyes.    Koru Naturals is a good compant to work with as well, and I am very pleased with all my Wild Fern Products.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. It feels so good on your face. It softens the skin.  I have to take a d  I like this cream. It is rejuvenating and it leaves the skin so soft.  Ihave to take a dietetic every day and it leaves the skin with  a soft feeling.  VP</li>
    <li> I first used these NZ manuka products after visiting NZ in Feb 2007.  They are all EXCELLENT and now I use them and share their excellence by giving them as gifts.  Their hand creme is awesome, the facial cleanser gentle and excellent, and this nite cream SUPER.  The entire product line is top notch and worth every cent.  Absolutely top notch!</li>
    <li> I love this cream..I put it on after a hot shower and I&#x27;m moist to go all day..try it..I will order again</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a month now and I must say that I have never had a cream work as well as this one.  Sure there is a fragrance when you first put it on, but it dissipates shortly after putting it on. However, it really smooths your skin and helps diminish fine lines and firms. I use it both day and night. Here in Wisconsin where the winters are bitterly cold, you need a good face cream. My husband loves it too as he has been using it also. I will need to be ordering more.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000UYF6G4 Manuka Honey Wild Ferns Night Revival Cream]]  I discovered Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Night Revival Cream while traveling in New Zealand.  The improvement in my skin was noticeable by the time I returned home.  Manuka honey, made from the Tea tree, has proven healing effects and is a favorite remedy in New Zealand.  Using Wild Ferns Gentle Cleanser and the Revival Cream have improved my skin&#x27;s texture and overall health to the point of invoking compliments from those who know me well. These produsts will be my lifetime beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to put on, lasts a long time, works very nicely. Also purchased the serum and eye cream. Wish amazon carried the day cream with SPF. The smell is strong when you first put it on but after a minute or two is gone. This has made my skin a lot smoother. Even my skin care person noticed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been 4 days and my skin is smoother. I even noticed that my makeup went on so much nicer. I will be buying this cream again. Most of all it smells really good and with my newborn up close to my face I don&#x27;t worry about harsh chemicals. The cream is thick when you put it on at night but most all night creams are. I love this cream!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks as a night cream. i had only tried moisturizer at night a few times, because my face breaks out easily. also, most products have cheaped out and use mineral oil. this does what it sez, it has made me skin look smooth, soft and not cleared pores, but not clogged. i believe the antibacterial prop of the honey must be the reason. i also use it as eye cream during the day. it feels good, absorbs well and skin looks good in the morning, even combination skin. i will keep using this.</li>
    <li> Another manuka winner. Very generous pot of delicious smelling night cream. Intense, fruity, flowery smell, but natural not perfume-ey. Goes on rich, soaks right in. I have normal to dry 40 year old skin. I am systematically trying ALL manuka honey products since we went to NZ and I will definatly order this one again. Koru ships fast.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks in conjunction with the skin blemish cream and both have been great.  Before I started using this, my combination skin looked dull and lines on my forehead were more prominent than ever (I&#x27;m 30 and not ready for this).  Now my skin looks plump and polished.  I&#x27;ve been using this at both morning and night just because I can&#x27;t find a day time moisturizer that I like as much as this and it hasn&#x27;t made my skin too oily.  I feel like I&#x27;ve just figured out a secret that&#x27;s been kept from me for the last 30 years.  I&#x27;ll report back if this changes through the harsh winter weather but for now, I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried other manuka honey creams and thought they worked great, even smelled nice, a little bit like...honey! But this cream in particular smells like old lady perfume. It also felt greasier to me than other manuka products. I would probably not recommend it to friends and will not buy it again. I much prefer the Pure Source brand of manuka night cream.</li>
    <li> I recently discovered Manuka Honey Wild Ferns products on a recent trip to New Zealand, and I could not be happier. The night revival cream is rich without making you oily and does not cause breakouts. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this stuff works like a charm. It also smells wonderful! I just wish that Amazon sold the SPF 15 Manuka Honey Wild Ferns Day Moisturizer - that is quite possibly the best daily moisturizer I have ever found! Luckily, I was able to find it on the Koru Naturals website.</li>
    <li> I have only been using for a couple of weeks but I like the feel on my skin.  I have normal to dry skin and think this is a keeper for me.  There is a perfume smell but goes away within a few min. it does not bother me.  My skin looks better and dry patches are gone below my cheeks.  I will purchase again.  Product as described and delivered on time.  This is a great night cream</li>
    <li> You must read the ingredients!!!!This product contains almond oil--if you have an allergy like I do to nuts ...do not use..I tried it anyway--silly me..and broke out in  hives on my face. I was so anxious to try it and sure otherwise a great product.The smell I love!!</li>
    <li> Love this cream! it has a wonderful smell, non-sticky, absorbs easily and makes skin soft.Im glad I found this brand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether Manuka honey really makes a tremendous difference, but I like using it.  A light cream which smells pretty good.  Actually, I put it on my face in the morning instead of the evening  Would recommend trying.</li>
