      <li>you own this try this</li>
      <li>Perhaps this really the \\&quot;best a guy can get.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Liked it.</li>
      <li>NICE.</li>
      <li>I kind of wrapped 3 reviews into one.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>It leaves me with a great clean shave.</li>
      <li>Best Razor I&#x27;ve ever used - just makes sure and get the real refills and not the fakes</li>
      <li>This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve had in days.</li>
      <li>It is best with the vibrating feature which helps the blade to cruise over the skin surface with no drag.</li>
      <li>I thought that was a great run considering the first one was a gift</li>
      <li>Got it very cheap when the deal was going on.</li>
      <li>This is a huge upgrade for me!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t felt a lot better than my Mach3.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this razor and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>Sure.</li>
      <li>so I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>I see Gillette is using famous athletes to pitch this piece of garbage.  </li>
      <li>I know that most men have their favorite shaving products.</li>
      <li>I am a satisfied Gillette customer.</li>
      <li>Fusion manual cartridges work well with Fusion Power Razor, these are cheaper than Fusion power cartridges and lasts more number of shaves.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
      <li>Gillette pioneeered this technique many years ago.l</li>
      <li>Edit: 07-Dec-14: More than 4 years</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gillette&#x27;s M3 razor was better but</li>
      <li>she is touching and kissing my face now.</li>
      <li>It is much better than Schick products, but sometimes with any of the Fusion/Mach products it just doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cut it&#x27;</li>
      <li>But Gillette&#x27;s razors and shaving gel are favorite, and in my opinion their system just provides a superior clean and comfortable shaving experience.</li>
      <li>The best thing is that its an electric shaver for wet use.    </li>
      <li>Most of all, it&#x27;s no where close to the Sensor in giving a comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>Fusion Razor are the best disposables on the market, and I bought this one just because it was black and orange and looked better then</li>
      <li>YOU CAN CHANGE BATTERY OR BLADES EASILY.</li>
      <li>Also the electric vibrations are way too strong.</li>
      <li>WITH THE BLADES BEING PRICED HIGH, GILLETTE IS BEING CHEAP, AND DAMAGING THEIR  GOOD WILL.  </li>
      <li>Fine, I thought - I will just use it without the power on.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; blades fit this fine.</li>
      <li>With this razor you will get a smooth and even shave.  </li>
      <li>With such great prices, i just had to have it.</li>
      <li>ie smooth close shave etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Otherwise, recommend the razor to anyone for smooth blade.</li>
      <li>Truly smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face is.</li>
      <li>I figured maybe it was just because it was a brand new blade, which always shave great the first time.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still using my first blade!!  </li>
      <li>Thanks to Gillette, shaving oil &amp; hand or face cream !!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products for more years than I can remember, and though I do not upgrade every time they come out with a new razor, I did upgrade to this razor and am really glad I did.</li>
      <li>Pretty satisfied with this razor.</li>
      <li>very smooth   long lasting blades  excellent product</li>
      <li>I saw an article in a Money magazine that said to clean the blades with &#x27;Arm and Hammer, Shower Clean&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Paired with a traditional [[ASIN:B000K7GP3Y Badger Hair Shaving Brush]] and a good [[ASIN:B000Q33CRE Shaving Soap]]</li>
      <li>Paired with a traditional [[ASIN:B000K7GP3Y Badger Hair Shaving Brush]] and a good [[ASIN:B000Q33CRE Shaving Soap]]</li>
      <li>the back blade on the tip is good for edging up sideburns and whatnot but needs to be sharper.</li>
      <li>I have tried other shavers to shave my head, this one works great.  </li>
      <li>Using this thing, this wondrous Fusion Power Razor, left me with as many, or more, irritated areas, averaged 5+</li>
      <li>It has actually made shaving a satisfying and enjoyable activity.</li>
      <li>like it provides a very nice close shave, cuts down on the times I need to shave.</li>
      <li>I used to laugh at the \\&quot;5 blade\\&quot; models too until I started shaving my head</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than Mach 3 (easier to handle), while maintaining the same smooth shave.</li>
      <li>You know, at some point it seems like they&#x27;ve run out of blades and other improvements just to give you a good shave, but after using the Phantom, they haven&#x27;t reached that point yet.  </li>
      <li>I have no idea whom in their right mind would give a possitive review to this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m convinced that the rave reviews here are from people new to shaving, people who have light beards, or people getting paid to promote the product.</li>
      <li>I really believe this is the most complete and closest shave I have ever had.</li>
      <li>which I get here and like very much.</li>
      <li>, now I get it, it works great without getting dull.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different razors and aside from a Shicks 5 blade nothing compares.</li>
      <li>My husband likes the power version better than regular one, which I bought for him together with blades from Costco.</li>
      <li>Shipping was faster than expected and it arrived nicely packaged on time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pretty satisfied with this razor. It works well and has a cleaner, smoother cut than any previous razor I&#x27;ve had. I can&#x27;t say as to whether that is due to the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; function or better blades, but I like it overall.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s feels very big, clumsy and less controllable. Also the electric vibrations are way too strong. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> seal of the pack was opened. For hygenic reasons I threw it awya to bust bin.  This height of quality that Amazon only can reach. Please refund my money as I have alredy thrown it to dust bin. Dont ask me any other question or options just refund it back else leave it. I have to think twice in future.</li>
    <li> I put aside my buying an electric razor.  The Gillette has given me the best shaves ever and the fewest nicks.  It is a very popular razor in my gym where I have had two taken from my gym bag. The razor is cheap but the blades are expensive.  This is a trick learned by the computer-printer industry where they sell to you the printer practically at cost but then you keep paying through the cost of the inks.  Gillette pioneeered this technique many years ago.l</li>
    <li> This is an improvement over the prior razors but needs to have a heavier feel, to light.</li>
    <li> Got it very cheap when the deal was going on. Liked it. Doesn&#x27;t felt a lot better than my Mach3.</li>
    <li> I am a female and I use this razor to shave various parts of my body. It leaves me with a great clean shave. I would recommend this razor to my friends. Before this razor I only used to use disposable razors. This is a huge upgrade for me! You can even buy replacement razor cartridges.</li>
    <li> I did not really notice a better shave with this product vs. the Mach 3 product.  Not worth the extra expense.</li>
    <li> I have used many razors over the years, including buying a few overpriced electric razors. Recently I asked my girlfriend to pick up some razors at the store \\&quot;not cheap ones please\\&quot; and boy was that a mistake. Anyway, I happened to be on Amazon already buying something so I looked at razors and decided on this one. I actually didn&#x27;t know that it was a battery operated razor. I had used a Gillette razor before and it gave me a good shave. So when I got this one with the battery and stuff I was kinda skeptical but figured it would shave good without the vibrations so I didn&#x27;t have to turn it on to shave if I didn&#x27;t want to... I thought maybe it would just carve up my face like a Halloween pumpkin. The first time I used it I was very pleasantly surprised. I figured maybe it was just because it was a brand new blade, which always shave great the first time. I am here writing this review now because after a week and a half of using this thing with the same blade, it&#x27;s still shaving closer than any shave I&#x27;ve ever had before. Really. I have had close shaves before but could still feel where the hair would eventually come back again meaning it was close but like it was only cutting the hair even with the skin and this one seems to cut it even lower if that makes sense. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face is. Truly smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. I have to actually take my time and pay attention now more than before, because if I miss a spot, I can really feel the difference. My girlfriend has really noticed the difference too... (don&#x27;t tell her I said this but it&#x27;s almost annoying how much she is touching and kissing my face now. lol)    I didn&#x27;t get any replacement blades with my original order, but I&#x27;ve been looking at the local stores and all the prices have been twice what I see here on Amazon for replacement blades. The actual razor is about the same, but I laughed when I saw 4 replacement blades at Rite Aid for the same price I just bought 8 here on Amazon. I think I&#x27;ll buysome more replacements to have on hand when I go traveling next month.    I have no idea what the last reviewer is complaining about. This thing is great... and the extra blade for trimming sideburns is great, even helps me to get under my nose perfectly. I feel no danger of being cut. I really believe this is the most complete and closest shave I have ever had. Very satisfied. I will never use a disposable razor or an electric razor again.</li>
    <li> I bought this Fusion Power Razor Phantom for my husband. He has been using Mach 3 since it was released and has been very happy with it. He did not think that you could improve that much upon it. He was pleasantly surprised by Fusion Power Razor Phantom. The shave is VERY close (I can attest to this ;) ) and it looks like my husband just shaved even 24 hours later. Previously you could see &#x27;shade&#x27; by late afternoon. My husband likes the power version better than regular one, which I bought for him together with blades from Costco. And blades last a very long time, which was my concern, since they are more expensive than Mach 3 ones. We both could not be happier with Fusion Power Razor.</li>
    <li> JUST BOUGHT A GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE.  IT IS PACKAGED IN PLASTIC CASE THAT YOU CAN NOT SEE CONTENTS.  THE PACKAGE SAYS 1 RAZOR 2 CARTRIDGES.  GILLETTE IS  COUNTING THE CARTRIDGE ON THE HANDLE AS ONE OF YOUR TWO.  THEY  CONSIDER THE HANDLE TO BE A RAZOR.  GILLETTE IS SHAVING ONE CARTRIDGE FROM YOUR PURCHASE.  WITH THE BLADES BEING PRICED HIGH, GILLETTE IS BEING CHEAP, AND DAMAGING THEIR  GOOD WILL.  JUST BE AWARE  THAT APPEARANCE IS DECEIVING. THE HANDLE IS A  RAZOR BY GILLETTE&#x27;S DEFINITION, THEY HAVE PLACED ONE OF YOUR TWO CARTRIDGES ON  THE HANDLE  TO MAKE IT A RAZOR.   YOU HAVE ONE LESS CARTRIDGE THEN YOU THINK.    LARRY</li>
    <li> I have a bad combination of a tough beard and sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for something to help me stop dreading shaving.  Impressed by some great reviews here, I decided to give this a try.    Using my old Sensor or Mach3/Mach3 turbo I had irritation, averaged 2-3 nicks or cuts per shave, and the razors weren&#x27;t up to cleanly shaving a few difficult areas of my face (under the ear for example).    Using this thing, this wondrous Fusion Power Razor, left me with as many, or more, irritated areas, averaged 5+ nicks or cuts per use, and it couldn&#x27;t cleanly shave even the areas the other two razors have no problem with.  Plus, it actually gets stuck shaving against the grain.    I&#x27;m serious, it stops moving and you have to put more pressure on it, bear down harder, to get it to move which, of course, results in those extra cuts and irritation, and then it still misses patches of beard you just tried to shave.    This is just a waste of money.  The technology behind this is only different, not better.  No doubt it&#x27;s the 5 blade foolishness that makes it stop moving in rougher sections of the beard, and the power blade vibration seems to accomplish nothing at all.    I&#x27;m convinced that the rave reviews here are from people new to shaving, people who have light beards, or people getting paid to promote the product.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst Gillette shaving blade ever made.  The head is so big that it is virtually impossible to shave well under your nose and chin.  The bibrating gimmick is absolutely useless and a complete waist of a battery.  Is a shame that a company that generally comes out with very good products could design such a terrible product.    I have no idea whom in their right mind would give a possitive review to this product.  You are either drunk, on drugs or work for Gillette.</li>
    <li> Great razor and the best price so I am pleased with my purchase.  Refills are little expensive so I will ignore the strip indicator suggesting when to change blade.  The change blade indicator wears out quickly so is not a true indicator of when blade is dull.   Otherwise, recommend the razor to anyone for smooth blade.</li>
    <li> It does fairly well, sometimes will scratch up the face - but that&#x27;s any razor for you.  It is much better than Schick products, but sometimes with any of the Fusion/Mach products it just doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cut it&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for around 2 years. I can not even think of switching back to any other shaver.    My skin is little sensitive and i have very hard beard which needs a lot of time to shave with a normal shaver/razor and i end up in minor cuts and buises. I have never faced any such issue with Gillete Fusion.    It definitely saves 5 minutes and give a closer + smoother shave. The best thing is that its an electric shaver for wet use.    With vibrator ON, it will just glide over the skin. I never had to pull it hard.    Battery Life: I shave twice a week and a good quality battery lasts atleast 9-10 months.    Edit: 07-Dec-14: More than 4 years and this shaver is still working perfectly, i never thought of changing to any other shaver, i just keep buying the cartridges. Cartridges too have good life and lasts many shaves.     Tip: Fusion manual cartridges work well with Fusion Power Razor, these are cheaper than Fusion power cartridges and lasts more number of shaves. Gillette is fooling customers with costlier power cartridges.</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR WAS EXCELLENT. IT&#x27;S CONVENIENT TO USE AND NO MESS. IT&#x27;S WORKING  NICE. YOU CAN CHANGE BATTERY OR BLADES EASILY. IT&#x27;S PERFECT RAZOR.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since this is the only razor that he&#x27;ll use. Their price is usually over $10 and this was a real bargain. I felt like buying two but then i saw the cartridges also on sale. With such great prices, i just had to have it. Shipping was faster than expected and it arrived nicely packaged on time.</li>
    <li> First of all,...&amp;#34;PHANTOM&amp;#34;? Really? Well, I can certainly ...empath it sitting in my trash bin. The only thing I fail to see is the what all the fuss was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it shave? Sure. Is it closer? Closer than what? Oh, you mean compared to those...ancient 2/3/4-blade ones? Well, not detectably. If it does shave any closer I for one could not tell. And no, the vibration adds to nothing detectable either besides a small humming noise.&lt;br /&gt;And, what is worse, the new head is too big with only a small portion of its surface corresponding to the blades: one has very little control under his nose and chin. It will nick you if not careful.&lt;br /&gt;Similar to digital camera manufacturers who are engaged in the &amp;#34;more-and-more megapixels&amp;#34; marketing war (only to end up with more and more...noise as no one seems to consider whether the lens can keep up or not), the &amp;#34;more-and-more blades&amp;#34; race has reached the point of ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So closer it may or may not be, but less comfortable it surely is. I use to shave against the grain my cheeks and under my jawline. And apparently, all these blades and vibration and &amp;#34;comfort strips&amp;#34; make the experience not something to long for. Speaking of the &amp;#34;comfort strip&amp;#34; (aka: &amp;#34;change-your-blade-head-already strip&amp;#34;), what is with the residual goo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, to add insult to injury, if you have any old Gillette blade cartridges knocking around in some drawer, forget about using them with this new holder.

    <li> This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve had in days. Shaving is not a nightmare anymore. I don&#x27;t have to dread days after not shaving for a while or have to \\&quot;soften\\&quot; in shower etc. Shave when u want and are good to go.</li>
    <li> I COULD&#x27;NT BELIEVE THE CLOSNESS OF MY FIRST SHAVE USING Gillette Fusion Power Razor, AND NO NICKS, NO BURNING OF FASE OR NECK SKIN.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with this razor. It&#x27;s better than Mach 3 (easier to handle), while maintaining the same smooth shave. Battery lasts for months, and I don&#x27;t really need to change the actual razor all that often (it works fine, even after the color has worn out). Look up on the internet on how to prolong razor life. Defintely recommended.</li>
    <li> is the best blade shaving system ever invented , 6 blades and the massaging are awesome .     grip and control is perfect  no irritation after save   very smooth   long lasting blades  excellent product</li>
    <li> Bought this back in July.... It is now Dec 15th and I&#x27;m still using my first blade!!  Still gives a great shave!!  The blades may be expensive but hell they last!!  I saw an article in a Money magazine that said to clean the blades with &#x27;Arm and Hammer, Shower Clean&#x27;.  I have been doing this, I guess it helps.  My strip that they say once is white needs to be replaced has almost fallen off??  But it still does the job.  I shave everyday 7days while at work, while at home for seven days I grow a thickish beard twice prior to shaving.  And like I said I&#x27;ve been doing it since July.  These blades are great!!!!  Was gonna buy a expensive electric razor, not now!  I still have a 12 pack refill!  At this rate that might last 5-6 yrs baby!!</li>
    <li> Last week of Jan 2010, price was 6.99, now (Feb 1) it is 7.25    8 cartridges cost was $19.99 last week, now it is $23.99.  Wow! This amazon item is now expensive than ebay!</li>
    <li> I have tried other shavers to shave my head, this one works great.  I shave and store my razor in the shower, the vibration power cuts through stubble without any effort, and I get 1 month per blade shaving my entire head and face nearly every day.  I used to laugh at the \\&quot;5 blade\\&quot; models too until I started shaving my head, now I get it, it works great without getting dull.  Cheap single blade razors only last a few days before going dull, non-power models require a lot of pull force.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products for more years than I can remember, and though I do not upgrade every time they come out with a new razor, I did upgrade to this razor and am really glad I did. First the lubricant strip is much larger than the earlier Gillette razor blades had, and the five blades actually seem to help avoid razor burn and cuts. Also the power button has been moved making accidental power on and offs a thing of the past. The razor honestly does a great job on the first shave, making going back over tough areas less likely, particularly right out of the shower.    I know that most men have their favorite shaving products. But Gillette&#x27;s razors and shaving gel are favorite, and in my opinion their system just provides a superior clean and comfortable shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Best Razor I&#x27;ve ever used - just makes sure and get the real refills and not the fakes cause they aren&#x27;t anywhere near as sharp or last as long as the real ones!</li>
    <li> Got one as a gift as the giver thought I needed to upgrade from my old Sensor razor.  Fusion is a piece of junk - much more difficult to handle and maneuver than the old sensor.  Most of all, it&#x27;s no where close to the Sensor in giving a comfortable shave.  I see Gillette is using famous athletes to pitch this piece of garbage.  Gillette is desperate for sales because I think they also know that this product is a piece of junk.  I read somewhere that they decided to come out with a 5-blade unit because Schick already had a 4-blade one and they wanted a new gimmick over their Mach razors.  Totally NOT WORTH the MONEY!</li>
    <li> Never thought I would like something that shaves and vibrates, but it really helps get a closer shave.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am a satisfied Gillette customer. This is another of their great product and I am loving it.  Few good points about Gillette Fusion Power Phantom Razor:  With this razor you will get a smooth and even shave.  You won&#x27;t even feel the blades.  People say five blades will hurt your face, but that&#x27;s not the case with this razor.  You will get rid of your facial hairs without hurting your skin.  No irritation after shave.    This is an amazing product from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the \\&quot;power\\&quot; model but bought this razor because my old Fusion was getting, well, old, and I got a good deal on this.  I&#x27;m pleased.  The final result of the shave isn&#x27;t any smoother than the non-power Fusion razor--that is, your face won&#x27;t be any smoother after shaving than before--but the shaving process is smoother.  The vibrating head has a numbing effect that takes a shave or two to get used to but makes shaving smoother.  I was worried that the numbing would make me careless and lead to more cuts, but it hasn&#x27;t so far.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this razor and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product, gives a close shave. Still up &amp; running too. I recommend this to a colleague as well. Thumbs</li>
    <li> I had been using the Fusion three bade razor and saw ads for this 5 blade with single blade for trimming. Even with out power it gives a smooth shave and with power its superb. It give a very close shave with out any discomfort. I have used it with just water . I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it. Shipping is always fast at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I been using the power fusion for years now.  I just bought a 2nd one to add one to my travel bag.    This is the best razor I have ever used.  From using the Mach3, this is a big improvement.  I shave everyday, and not only my face I shave my head with this razor also, everyday.  The blades do last,  I get 3 weeks easy on a blade.  I can get a 4th week and usually do, however notice it getting dull and harder to shave.    The power does help, some people say it dont....maybe not a whole lot, but heck a battery will last me a year on this razor.      Having sensitive skin, I cant get a super close shave and I am not looking for one.  This does the job well with one pass, and never has cut me to date.</li>
    <li> You know, at some point it seems like they&#x27;ve run out of blades and other improvements just to give you a good shave, but after using the Phantom, they haven&#x27;t reached that point yet.  It&#x27;s a pretty tight shave and I think some of that has to do with the \\&quot;power\\&quot; aspect, which is basically the vibrating movement of the entire razor.      I think it gives the best shave of anything I&#x27;ve tried.  I use this on my face and my head and I notice I can skip an extra day, which in the long run saves me time.    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wanted the new razor, but thought the power feature was a gimmick.  So I thought I ordered the plain razor.  When it arrived it was the power version.  Fine, I thought - I will just use it without the power on.  But I had a heavy beard (six days of growth) and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just as if I were shaving the next day after shaving.  Hardly any effort at all and even in the chin area it powered through the heavy growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good work Gillette.  Perhaps this really the \\&quot;best a guy can get.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Already multi-blade shaver excels in shaving experience.  this one add agitation to it so it makes the shaving even  smoother and safer.     In openGL, to get rid of digitization artifacts of edge,   you can do by \\&quot;shaking\\&quot; the scene. This one might get the  idea from that, albeit in a mechanical way.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000BUW8WM Gillette Fusion Power Razor - 1 Razor, 1 Cartridge and 1 Battery]]&lt;br /&gt;I like it provides a very nice close shave, cuts down on the times I need to shave. From every day to every other day and I have a very heavy dark beard, I use the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridges I got from Amazon http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B8F6J2/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s04_i00 and they work very good I go through a cartridge every 2 1/2 weeks I also use Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel Shave Gel, Ultra Sensitive, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E24K/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o06_s00_i00 which I get here and like very much. I kind of wrapped 3 reviews into one.&lt;br /&gt;How ever I find all 3 work good together for me.</li>
    <li> As a shaving fanatic I try lots of different systems and lubricants. The Power Fusion is the best of the razors available. It is best with the vibrating feature which helps the blade to cruise over the skin surface with no drag. I use shaving oil alone as my lubricant... no shave cream at all. I put the oil on with my face very wet, shave down then up. Then I wet my face again with water alone, adding no more oil and shave again. I finish with any moisturizing face or hand cream rubbed over my shaved face, feel for any missed areas and shave those missed areas. When done, I have a perfect shave with NO irritation. Thanks to Gillette, shaving oil &amp; hand or face cream !!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have always used electric shavers under the false impression that these would be easier on my skin than a blade.  I recently found myself attending a wedding and having forgotten my electric, so for the first time I was forced to use a blade.  It was a cheap disposable and I found the experience harrowing and difficult, but my skin felt smooth and was less irritated than after an electric shave, so I sprung for the Fusion here after soliciting the advice of a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the reviews, I understood the vibrating feature to be a gimmick, but it has a very soothing, reassuring effect.  It&#x27;s easy to forget I&#x27;m using a blade at all, except for the smooth, close shave, and not having to pass over the same area multiple times as I did with electrics.  It has actually made shaving a satisfying and enjoyable activity.</li>
    <li> Great product that shaves well as it should. the vibration feature seems to actually help. the back blade on the tip is good for edging up sideburns and whatnot but needs to be sharper. my only real complaint is that the blades are WAY overpriced. i am highly considering an old school straight razor to go with my kiehl&#x27;s shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Having a tough beard and tender skin I, unfortunately believed Gillette&#x27;s Ads. ie smooth close shave etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They lie!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable razor drag and the razor burns leave your face in pain when you&#x27;re finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette&#x27;s M3 razor was better but finding one seems to be an impossibility.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time Gillette user and will be for years to come. I have tried many different razors and aside from a Shicks 5 blade nothing compares. I find that Gillette blades last longer and i personally think they do a better job.</li>
    <li> After 6 or 7 years, my original Power razor finally died because the seal around the power button finally gave and water got into the electronics. I thought that was a great run considering the first one was a gift and I thought the whole power thing was a gimmick. When the motor died and I shaved without it, I noticed the difference. I could live without it, but choose not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower without any shaving cream with these razors and I get about 6 months out of each blade. I think I can get away with this because I have fine whiskers and only need to shave every other day. The &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; blades fit this fine. I do not notice a difference between them and the power blades, so I always buy the cheaper ones. I did a little search on line and apparently a lot of people found out the same thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he had one and it broke and&lt;br /&gt;requested another one.  The idea that it is battery powered is&lt;br /&gt;what he liked about it.</li>
    <li> Fusion Razor are the best disposables on the market, and I bought this one just because it was black and orange and looked better then the Blur one in my bathroom.</li>
