    <li> Very soft bristles! Love this brush!</li>
    <li> Ok blending brush. I bought three of these and I work as a make up artist and read a good review on these brushes from Lauren Curtis. She is big on YouTube and recommended these brushes. They are ok for the price but lost their shape after the first wash. The are very fluffy and good to really blend those hard lines. They do pick up quite a bit of excess product though, which can be a bit wasteful. Haven&#x27;t owned them long enough yet to see how they hold up over time, but will update after two or three months of continual use.</li>
