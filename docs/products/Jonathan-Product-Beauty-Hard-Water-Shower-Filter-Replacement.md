      <li>Great replacement filter at lower price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
      <li>We have copper in our well water and this filter is the best one I have found to remove most of the copper from the water in my shower.  </li>

      <li>Bottom line is that I&#x27;ve yet to read consistently good reviews for any shower filter that is supposed to soften water.</li>

      <li>love my filter I buy this time after time great filter for the shower</li>
      <li>I am normally very healthy and not on any medications.</li>
      <li>I have purchased these filters for years and they have always done an excellent job of keeping my hair soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>There was a HUGE difference!!   </li>
      <li>I PURCHASED IT FROM AMAZON FOR THE FIRST TIME AND VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRICE AND SERVICE.</li>
      <li>Boy, am I glad we did!</li>
      <li>My hairdresser noticed the difference and said we have obtained the goal of getting my hair healthy!</li>
      <li>This product is great - the water force is strong despite the size of the filtering mechanism.  </li>
      <li>I may be allergic to copper that is leached into the water from this kind of filter media.</li>
      <li>but it is not efficient or cost effective for a whole-house system.</li>
      <li>I considered using the Jonathan Beauty shower filter because I liked the idea of cleaner water for my hair and skin.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to install and change the filters.</li>
      <li>This is a good fit for replacement to Aquasana</li>
      <li>This is the kind of item most bathrooms need.  </li>
      <li>We love this product - shower feel amazing every time we replace the filter</li>
      <li>I have been using this last 2 years, it&#x27;s just excellent , kind of pricy</li>
      <li>I feel very comfortable knowing that many impurities are removed from my shower water.  </li>
      <li>Then I tested my Brita water filter that I use for drinking and got a reduced amount of 20ppm, just so I could make sure the meter was working.  </li>
      <li>My skin has a notable softness to it also.</li>
      <li>I love this water filter.  </li>
      <li>I love this system and will always buy the refills when my cartridge wears out.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off buying a PPM water tester to test the product for yourself.</li>
      <li>This filter works, and more affordable than some of the systems being sold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the T3 because it doesn&#x27;t use copper.</li>
      <li>Shipped from China, most of it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not wasting any more money on junk.</li>
      <li>But with this shower filter, I was impressed how good of a job they do, I smell no chlorine, only fresh water.</li>
      <li>We have filtered out drinking water (reverse osmosis) for many years and saw an article about filtering shower water</li>
      <li>This product does that and more by keeping the skin healthy.  </li>
      <li>I finally realized the issue and my search for the perfect filter started.</li>
      <li>Skin feels much better using it too.</li>
      <li>I love my showers..  </li>
      <li>We are satisfied with it, since we do not use a water softener.</li>
      <li>The softened water was also better for washing our clothes.</li>
      <li>or perhaps the problem is greater than the solution.</li>
      <li>I moved from Zephyrhills fl, its known for its spring water, I had lovely well water there to another area in FL</li>
      <li>And I have.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re going to pay a bit more but consider your condition.</li>
      <li>I realize there are many products on the market but consider this, purchasing a water filtering system is like buying steak.</li>
      <li>I live in Florida and the water isn&#x27;t great .</li>
      <li>My brunette hair lost the frizz became smooth and shiney and held the color better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because Amazon says they&#x27;re no longer available.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft, shiny, and looks great.</li>
      <li>and they are easy to use.</li>
      <li>Based on reading a good deal of online research, the only effective solution for softening water is a salt-based water softener.</li>
      <li>which is what most people shower with, but now that I think about it how could water that is traveling so fast through a shower filter possibly be effective at removing harmful metals.  </li>
      <li>And when I tested the water coming out of the Jonathan water system, using a brand new filter to be fair, and I got these readings..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my hair since using the softener attachment.</li>
      <li>It softens your skin and provides you with fabulous hair.  </li>
      <li>Great filters - always keep coming back to re-order replacements.</li>
      <li>Our water is not the best, public water, and we can&#x27;t afford a whole house water filter.</li>
      <li>It is supposedly really good at eliminating chlorine, but if you are sensitive to copper</li>
      <li>These were replacements and the price was very good compared to other listings.</li>
      <li>Great product , fast shipping ,highly recommend</li>
      <li>The filter was super easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We love it very much</li>
      <li>significantly then</li>
      <li>thing I would add is, as the instructions say, make sure you first run the water into a bucket or you will stain your bathtub with the Carbon that is in the filter.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the effort!</li>
      <li>Water felt softer and better the first 2 days I used it (by the way, I have gone through 2 filters, so I have used this product for over 6 months).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
      <li>I installed the Jonathan Shower Filter and now our hair feels clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>Also, It makes my hair super smooth.</li>
      <li>Clean drinkable water from the shower filter.</li>
      <li>My and my kids&#x27; hair never felt clean.</li>
      <li>It has completely changed for the better the texture of my hair and my skin stopped breaking out as often!</li>
      <li>This was a dream come true and</li>
      <li>This really seems to help my hair and my skin feel a lot better...</li>
      <li>Makes me feel good about not putting extra &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in my hair that is found in tap</li>
      <li>really nice so far.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t shower or bathe my child without it and the price is not bad.</li>
      <li>This product arrives quickly, is packaged well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a health conscious guy but females will greatly benefit just the same and enjoy beauty enhancements.</li>
      <li>I am amazed that most of the filtration systems I have looked into contain this new filter media KDF 55 which contains copper and zinc.</li>
      <li>the water without a filter has so many chemicals that most people think it&#x27;s there skin care products that break them out or dry out there skin</li>

    <li> I live in Florida and the water isn&#x27;t great . I use the filter in my shower and it really makes a huge differance. Skin feels soft and it leaves your hair soft and managable. Could not live here without this product . I highly recomend it! It&#x27;s everything it claims to be. thank you</li>
    <li> This is a good fit for replacement to Aquasana shower head filter and cost cheaper significantly then Aquasana offer.&lt;br /&gt;It seems the same quality like the over priced Aquasana filter and I suspect both use the same source for the filter.</li>
    <li> I have actually been using this system for 2 years now and never questioned it, i just assumed it was doing its job.  I just recently purchased a dissolved solids meter to check the quality of my tap water and decided to also test how well the Jonathan Beauty Water system was doing.  I tested my tap water for dissolved solids (parts per million) and got the following readings from the meter... Cold tap- 38ppm  Hot tap 50ppm.  Then I tested my Brita water filter that I use for drinking and got a reduced amount of 20ppm, just so I could make sure the meter was working.  And when I tested the water coming out of the Jonathan water system, using a brand new filter to be fair, and I got these readings.. Cold shower water- 34ppm, Hot/Lukewarm shower water 50ppm.  I was very disappointed that there was no difference in lukewarm to hot water which is what most people shower with, but now that I think about it how could water that is traveling so fast through a shower filter possibly be effective at removing harmful metals.  Anyway, I hope this helps some people.  Dan.</li>
    <li> Great product , fast shipping ,highly recommend</li>
    <li> The Jonathan shower water purification system was ranked one of the best on a consumer website.  This included the removal of lead.  I won&#x27;t shower or bathe my child without it and the price is not bad.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have always been very satified with it. I wish Sephora still carried it is was convienent but the price on Amazon is much lower.</li>
    <li> The home we recently purchased came with a Jonathan filter in the master shower. It seemed to help soften the water a little. The material inside the filter was \\&quot;rattling,\\&quot; so I decided to buy a replacement. The replacement filter is worthless as other users have stated. When I first turn on the shower, the water seems a bit softer for a couple of minutes but quickly turns to that rubbery hard water feeling. My straight hair is flat even with the new Jonathan filter. At our previous home, we had a water softener that was very effective and my hair had a lot of volume. The softened water was also better for washing our clothes. Based on reading a good deal of online research, the only effective solution for softening water is a salt-based water softener. Reverse osmosis seems to be a great option for improving the quality of drinking water but it is not efficient or cost effective for a whole-house system. Bottom line is that I&#x27;ve yet to read consistently good reviews for any shower filter that is supposed to soften water. I&#x27;m not wasting any more money on junk. We&#x27;re going with another water softener for the entire house and a filtration unit for the kitchen sink to improve drinking water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of these and will continue to do so. I do see a big difference in my hair when I use this filter. My hair was getting dry and brittle from minerals in my water and this filter eliminated the problem.</li>
    <li> I have well water.  My softener and Iron Filter are inadequate.  My hair used to be frizzy and I would have to continually get hard water treatments at my salon.  Since 2010, when I began using the Jonathan beauty water filter system in my shower, my hair is soft, not frizzy, and even my skin feels soft, not itchy or tight.  I love this system and will always buy the refills when my cartridge wears out. It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Clean drinkable water from the shower filter.</li>
    <li> Great filters - always keep coming back to re-order replacements. They remove the harsh chemicals out of the water, and the chlorine smell present in some hotels and houses. Skin feels much better using it too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after my other shower filter system converted their filter media to KDF 55 (copper-zinc chlorine oxidation method). I developed rashes on my scalp, neck, back and shoulders and my eyelids swelled up. I am normally very healthy and not on any medications. I went to my dermatologist, allergist, eye doctor and finally internist trying to determine the cause.  I was tested for 200 known allergens, but the tests were negative for anything that would be causing my symptoms. My doctor agreed that I should have extensive blood work done to rule out any systemic disease. Everything came back (luckily) that I was completely healthy. The rash was classified at atopic dermatitis. It seems like it would be simple to figure this out, but at first I didn&#x27;t know that the filter media had been changed from pure carbon. When I did research and found out, I thought I just needed to add the carbon component to clear up my skin, so I tried this system because it has both and also I couldn&#x27;t find a pure carbon system. I finally found another shower filter that is carbon only and my symptoms have disappeared.I may be allergic to copper that is leached into the water from this kind of filter media. I am amazed that most of the filtration systems I have looked into contain this new filter media KDF 55 which contains copper and zinc. It is supposedly really good at eliminating chlorine, but if you are sensitive to copper it is a major problem. Please be aware.</li>
    <li> I have been using this last 2 years, it&#x27;s just excellent , kind of pricy but work great!  I usually buy 2 of them per year, it reduces the hardeness of water , you can feel the softness of your skin after just 2 bath.</li>
    <li> This product really works with Los Angeles&#x27; really lime-y water.  I used to itch after getting out of the shower and the product really works, but you really need to replace it every 3 months, which gets expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of item most bathrooms need.  I&#x27;m a health conscious guy but females will greatly benefit just the same and enjoy beauty enhancements.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to keep the green out of my hair, as I have very acidic water, which comes from years of oxidized copper pipes. (Despite an Acid Neutralizer and Water Softener-I still have the problem.) There must be a Carbon Filter in this, for it left my very blond hair; silvery, blue-gray. If I were a trend-setter, people would have found me clever for the Holidays, as there was still a great deal of green in my hair, too. However, this green was lime-lemon-day-glow green! I had it all stripped out with Redken&#x27;s PreArt, at the Salon. The colors that came out in the plastic cap I wore while under the dryer (that&#x27;s the ONLY way this stuff will come out)were quite the hit at the salon! This filter is also supposed to soften your skin and hair???? I must have received the wrong product. It claims to remove up to 90% of Copper. They never tested it on my well. Alas, it is great for Brunettes. I gave it to my neighbor and she loves it!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me because our water cast a green hue to my highlighted hair.  Not only has my haircolor been maintained by using this filter system, but I was surprised by how much &#x27;cleaner&#x27; I felt after taking a shower when first began using this system.</li>
    <li> I moved from Zephyrhills fl, its known for its spring water, I had lovely well water there to another area in FL and I got stuck with awful city water. For the first few weeks I thought our water had a smell but I couldn&#x27;t name it. It was chlorine and my shower would smell like a pool. My hair was colored dark at the time and my stylist was like oh you must be swimming a lot. I of course didn&#x27;t put two and two together and was dumbfounded. I finally realized the issue and my search for the perfect filter started. I got one at Lowe&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t do squat. My hair was course and faded. Finally I saw the Jonathan system at Sephora and thought I would give it a shot. My skin and hair were noticeably softer. I was holding off going blonde because of the chlorine, but I did it and had no issues with discolored hair. My hair was still soft and same with my skin. Since our water is so highly chlorinated we do have to switch the filter about ever 3 month which is my only gripe, but that isn&#x27;t the filter&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> I really cannot tell you if there is a huge difference on my hair or not. I mean i&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a long time so it&#x27;s not in the best shape ever. My husband does like it though so off of his comments I went with a four star. I have been using this for years and will continue.</li>
    <li> love my filter I buy this time after time great filter for the shower</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this filter I&#x27;m serious my skin is sensitive and so without this filter it would get very dry I&#x27;d breakout and I&#x27;m telling you I was buying all kinds of lotions lol I didn&#x27;t realize how bad the water is without a filter the water without a filter has so many chemicals that most people think it&#x27;s there skin care products that break them out or dry out there skin and it&#x27;s the water anyway buy it you&#x27;ll see a big big difference and I just bought another one and I&#x27;ve tried other filters all I&#x27;m going to say is nope ! Lol this one is the one</li>
    <li> The Jonathan Beauty Water Shower Purifucation System is a must have!  It softens your skin and provides you with fabulous hair.  This product arrives quickly, is packaged well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it removes heavy contaminates from our shower water. My hair is much softer, cleaner feeling. My skin has a notable softness to it also. I am allergic to chlorine so this was the biggest reason of all for me to purchase Jonathan Product Beauty Water Shower Purification System Replacement Filter, it removes the chlorine better than our other filter!</li>
    <li> We use this shower filter on a daily basis.  It leaves hair and skin soft and clean, no residue of shampoo or soap.  Our well water is hard, often leaving copper deposits on shower walls, the filter also helps keep staining to a minimum.</li>
    <li> I have been using this system for 2 years now. It is very easy to install and change the filters. You will definitely notice a difference in your water.</li>
    <li> Works with the color science/aqua sana  showerhead.</li>
    <li> I have asthma, all my life since birth. My doctor 3 years ago, was prescribing me three different types of asthma meds, today, I haven&#x27;t used an inhaler for over 3 years. WhenI would take showers, on ocasions, I would weeze from all of the chlorine in the water,iturns to vapor, in the shower, not to mention all the 200+ other chemicals put in the water. But with this shower filter, I was impressed how good of a job they do, I smell no chlorine, only fresh water. Thanks Jonathan Products, your well appeciated by me. Also, I drink distilled water, to increase the amount of oxygen in the body, ridding toxins easier. I recommend it for anyone whom suffers from asthma. And everyone else, they shouldn&#x27;t put all those \\&quot;unnessessary\\&quot; chemicals in our water. Chlorine is a known cancer causing agent. Also, Fluoride acummulates in the body, causing brain damage, destroying the thyroid gland, destroying your kidneys, and overall, your immune system. And all of us taxpayers, pay for this stuff to be put in there. Shipped from China, most of it. They spnd millions of our tax money, to poison us? How mean.</li>
    <li> Lasts about 3 weeks before it goes caput.</li>
    <li> These are great filters, easy to install and last a long time.  I highly recommend Jonathan Beauty products and especially  the shower filters.</li>
    <li> We have these on our showers to filter the water and have had them for several years. It is a &amp;#34;peace of mind&amp;#34; product. Who knows what comes out of the water line anymore! We have filtered out drinking water (reverse osmosis) for many years and saw an article about filtering shower water so we bought these and they are easy to use. We have thought about using a whole house system but have not decided to take the plunge yet. Until then this give us a little peace of mind that we are doing something to help our physical wellness. These were replacements and the price was very good compared to other listings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the other filters. Some are just as pricey. Some cheaper. This is the Rolls Royce of water filters.&lt;br /&gt;You will see the difference in your hair and skin immediately.</li>
    <li> works great for Hard Water</li>
    <li> I considered using the Jonathan Beauty shower filter because I liked the idea of cleaner water for my hair and skin.  I feel very comfortable knowing that many impurities are removed from my shower water.  My hair and skin look and feel much healthier!&lt;br /&gt;I have been recommending this Jonathan product to friends and family and I will continue to share it with others!  Don&#x27;t hesitate; just buy it!</li>
    <li> Jonathan Beauty Water filters out a lot of iron we have in our water.  That helps to preserve my hair color and prevents it from turning a brassy blonde color.  It is well worth the effort!</li>
    <li> My well water is Harsh. When the filter needs replacing it&#x27;s quite evident..My shower walls get rust stained..imagine how it affects skin and hair. That said..this last replacement has not made as significant a change as in the past.I don&#x27;t know if is this particular filter or perhaps the problem is greater than the solution. Thus my five star product falls to three</li>
    <li> My skin gets real dry living in Southern California but wioth this water filter it does not get dry. I try to keep it but sometimes wait too long and then I get dry skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my hair since using the softener attachment. It has been much  softer  and easier to style . I went away on vacation and quickly noticed how much I missed it!</li>
    <li> This filter is the only thing standing between me and green/brassy hair that is naturally blond.  I wish we didn&#x27;t have well water, but since we do, this is a good investment.</li>
    <li> Nice to filter shower water as well!  We have in my son&#x27;s shower as well so he gets cleaner water.</li>
    <li> Overall it helped. It was great product. You can feel the difference.</li>
    <li> This works but I live in an area with really hard water so it&#x27;s really difficult to get soft-water. It&#x27;s better than the T3 because it doesn&#x27;t use copper. I had an allergic reaction to the copper from the T3 and had a rash after showering 3x.</li>
    <li> We have very hard water so I have been trying several different shower filters. These cartridges work well for the first couple of weeks, mediocre for the next couple of weeks, then unable to tell it&#x27;s installed after that. I realize that is partially because of our water hardness, but that is why I bought it in the first place. Was hoping for at least three or four months per cartridge.</li>
    <li> I have well water and my hair would never keep its color. I installed the filter and my hair color doesn&#x27;t turn orange. The stream from the shower head has good pressure too. It was worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have very high sodium well water and could not do without this filter. Have been using them for several years. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> We have hard water here. I tried several other systems and didn&#x27;t get very good results. The cartridges last me about 6 months. Even if you have a water softener you will notice results and the cartridges will last longer.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW.  I LOVE IT.  I PURCHASED IT FROM AMAZON FOR THE FIRST TIME AND VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRICE AND SERVICE.</li>
    <li> I loved these filters but we were replacing them every month and it got expensive. We need a filtering system because we live in a rural area and our water is from a private well. This product might last longer for someone who may not have as many particulates in their water.</li>
    <li> Wanted a filter that would prevent hair fall.  This product does that and more by keeping the skin healthy.  I would recommend this product to a person who has hair fall, damaged and weak hair, and dry or oily scalp creating dandruff.</li>
    <li> We live in the sierra foothills and have well water. My color treated brunette hair and my daughters naturally blonde hair were taking a beating - my daughters long blonde hair had no shine and was dry, frizzy, flat, oily, no volume and extremely difficult to comb when wet. My hair was the same and the color was stripped quickly. My hairdresser mentioned this product so we tried it and WOW what a difference. The blonde was blonder and bouncy, shiney and healthy, easier to comb through after the shower. My brunette hair lost the frizz became smooth and shiney and held the color better. My hairdresser noticed the difference and said we have obtained the goal of getting my hair healthy! I will be buying replacement filters and hope they continue to make them forever.</li>
    <li> I thought I was going crazy but my unprocessed hair was turning into straw even with frequent haircuts.  I spent so much money on special conditioners etc, turns out I had hard water.  This was a dream come true and my locks are soft and silky again!  Thank goodness!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year and 1/2 ago because I moved to a city with very hard water. My skin and scalp began to bother me (itchy) and my hair was not nearly as soft or voluminous as it was before I moved. I do NOT dye my hair even though most people usually buy this product to help preserve their hair color and to keep it from becoming brassy or blue-tinged. After using Jonathon&#x27;s beauty water shower purification system, my skin was no longer itchy, I had less problems with my scalp, and my hair became incredibly soft and much more easy to style. There was a HUGE difference!!   I have found that the replacement filters on amazon are much less expensive than where I used to purchase them (a beauty website) and will continue to buy my replacement filters from here as long as they are less expensive than other websites.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet - hence the 4 stars, but it&#x27;s a less expensive filter than the Aquasana, and apparently the same product.</li>
    <li> The filter improves the effect the water has on my dry, curly hair. Instead of being brittle from the harsh chemicals in the water, my hair is soft with a healthier sheen with the Jonathon Beauty Water filter.</li>
    <li> I started using these filters after my hair was falling out and hair was turning a slight orange. This didn&#x27;t help with the hair falling out but definitely cleared up the yellowing/oranging of my hair. Also, It makes my hair super smooth. Makes me feel good about not putting extra &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in my hair that is found in tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these are the replacement filters, but the whole system in general is super easy to put on the shower spout and it has nice different options for pressure. I have had a lot of problems with past shower heads leaking at the connector and I have not had that problem with this and I have been using for almost two years now. The filter was super easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would add is, as the instructions say, make sure you first run the water into a bucket or you will stain your bathtub with the Carbon that is in the filter.</li>
    <li> Great replacement filter at lower price.</li>
    <li> I was given my first Jonathon shower filter system 5 years ago, as a gift, plus two extra filters. I&#x27;m allergic to chlorine, so it was greatly appreciated. Since I live alone, I am the only one who uses it.  I have replaced the filter only two more times, myself.  It really works well, and I can tell when I need to change filters, as I can smell the chlorine in the water coming out.  This filter works, and more affordable than some of the systems being sold.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It helps your color last longer.</li>
    <li> This water filter softens my hair after shampooing and conditioning it.  It is gentle on the skin because it filters out impurities.</li>
    <li> Fast.  Reliable.  Quality Product.  Good directions for installation</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this for almost couple of years now. I learned that our body esp the skin absorbs so much from the water we use that&#x27;s why I searched and settled to this brand. After using this, I feel cleaner and the water seems softer. We have lived in a house with a well water and I think it is worth using. Now, we are living in a house with city water and it is still seems to make our water cleaner and softer. We love it very much and I think it is very helpful especially we have a baby and young kids at home! I even recommended it to my sister and she is happy with my recommendation. It&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for the past 2 years ..really nice so far.</li>
    <li> I have very hard water with magnesium in it. It causes orange stains on my toilets and sinks. My water would change my hair color especially the blonde . I put this filter in my shower and my hair color stays wonderful. I have to change the filter about every 2 1/2 -3 months. I have been doing this for a couple of years now and will continue to do so. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This really seems to help my hair and my skin feel a lot better...this implies that the chlorine is being removed. I really like this product and have already purchased a replacement filter for the future. I have had this product for about 2 months now and no problems!</li>
    <li> Great product if you have well water and the water softener just doesn&#x27;t cut it for your hair. No more orange hair!</li>
    <li> My water us SOOOO hard. This helps a lot.</li>
    <li> We have really bad water in my area. My and my kids&#x27; hair never felt clean. I installed the Jonathan Shower Filter and now our hair feels clean and shiny. Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I am a long time fan of this product . I actually notice the difference to my skin and hair when I use this filter; my water is not as hard and full of chlorine.</li>
    <li> I hope they never discontinue this filter. It has completely changed for the better the texture of my hair and my skin stopped breaking out as often!</li>
    <li> We have used this filter on our shower heads before.  We are satisfied with it, since we do not use a water softener.</li>
    <li> I can feel the difference in my hair....much softer....ditto skin....</li>
    <li> my hair was so much healthier using this product, i would recommend it , especially if you have well water.</li>
    <li> I use it to remove the hardness and clorine from my water. I change it every year and my skin stays soft.</li>
    <li> I love this water filter.  My hair, my skin and my eyes truly appreciate it!  If it needs replacing, I always know because my eyes get red and irratated after a shower .... put in a new filter and all is well!  This is a greqt product!</li>
    <li> Our water is not the best, public water, and we can&#x27;t afford a whole house water filter. Jonathon Beauty Filter is remarkable and we saw results immediately, within 2 days. I realize there are many products on the market but consider this, purchasing a water filtering system is like buying steak. You&#x27;re going to get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;This product, if found at a discounted rate is a steal. Would I recommend this product to a friend? Absolutely yes. And I have.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re going to pay a bit more but consider your condition. A few dollars more to make your condition better? Allow me to put it this way; If you were my wife and my desire is to see your natural beauty? Yes, I&#x27;m buying one for each shower head in our house. And I have.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will feel cleaner, your skin will feel a difference. Please keep in mind this product doesn&#x27;t replace your quality hair products or skin care but it helps immensely.</li>
    <li> I love my showers..  This is awesome easy install and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair and skin much healthier, not as dry..</li>
    <li> We love this product - shower feel amazing every time we replace the filter</li>
    <li> We purchased an extra filter at the same time as the product. I&#x27;m glad I did because Amazon says they&#x27;re no longer available. It&#x27;s a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I have bought from Jonathan direct and from an Amazon supplier and the filters are not the same. Only order for Jonathan for the real thing. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Water felt softer and better the first 2 days I used it (by the way, I have gone through 2 filters, so I have used this product for over 6 months). Maybe our water is simply SO bad and polluted (central NY) that it can&#x27;t handle it, but my hair is very damaged. I don&#x27;t use styling products, blow dry, heat tools, etc. Moved away from a place with softer water (about 4 grains per gallon)where my hair was soft, never tangled, smooth.... to central new york with extremely hard water (9 grains per gallon) and chlorine, and my hair feels dry and crispy even when wet, constantly tangled and breaking. I guess the water is too much for the filter, but they should at least publish some guidelines. I don&#x27;t want to waste my money.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these filters for years and they have always done an excellent job of keeping my hair soft and beautiful. This is the first time I have purchased this filter from Amazon through an independent seller and it will be the last. Every since I have been using this filter with my shower system my hair has become brittle hard and extremely broken. I believe I. was sold a filter that was tampered with or not authentic because it is definitely not doing what this same filter has done for me in the past I will never use this seller again and in the future will go back to buying my filters at Sephora a reputable business.</li>
    <li> We have water with tons of minerals in it (well water in the country) and we also have a water softener which puts salt into the water to soften it so my hair was getting so dry until I purchased this Jonathan Water Filter and only have to replace the filter every six months or so.</li>
    <li> This is an wonderful, awesome filter, I really love using them -Jonathan Beauty Water Replacement Filter, and, and, and !!</li>
    <li> I finally decided one day to test the water from the shower filter. It was a week old brand new replacement filter. The PPM from the water was 30PPM less than the normal tap water!!! This thing does absolutely nothing! No wonder I was having no results. You&#x27;re better off buying a PPM water tester to test the product for yourself. Such a waste of money!</li>
    <li> We moved last year.  My new town puts a lot of chlorine in the water and my hair (color-treated and curly) was looking like straw and acting very rude.  I tried another brand of water filter that looks almost identical to the Jonathan filter with disappointing results. I thought I was going to have to buy a rain barrel or wash my hair every day with distilled water, but I decided to try another brand of filter.  After the first shower with the Jonathan filter, my hair is back to its old self.  Thank God!  I don&#x27;t know how long the filter will last, but I&#x27;ll post when I see that it&#x27;s losing its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have been using this system for years.  Helpful with well water.  When my filter starts getting old I can always tell by the condition of my hair.  It&#x27;s a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> This product is great - the water force is strong despite the size of the filtering mechanism.  During the few days that I had to live without it while I waited for the replacement filter, I saw a big difference in my hair - much drier and course feeling, and much less manageable overall.  Besides that, the overwhelming smell of chlorine almost made me want to skip showering entirely, which was immediately remedied as soon as I installed the new filter - I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> We have copper in our well water and this filter is the best one I have found to remove most of the copper from the water in my shower.  My hair will stay soft and keep its blonde color for a long time when I use the filter.  I hope they never stop making it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this filter for years. It&#x27;s a must have if your water quality is horrible. After all, I spend so much money on coloring and straightening treatments, why would I not invest in the water quality.</li>
    <li> Makes hair color last so much longer!!!!</li>
    <li> We have well water that is very hard and high in iron and made my hair very hard, brittle, and frizzy. I tried using products to strip the iron build up from my hair as well as tried using baking soda and vinegar on my hair. None of those options worked. I thought our only option would be to install a water softener for the whole house, but found this option by searching online. Boy, am I glad we did! This makes such a noticeable difference in my hair - with the filter it&#x27;s soft, shiny, and looks great. I can also tell a big difference in my skin - not as dry with the filter. I also no longer have to use detangler in my daughter&#x27;s hair. I love this solution and recommend it to anyone with hard water.</li>
