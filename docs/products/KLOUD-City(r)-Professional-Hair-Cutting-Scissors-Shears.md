    <li> They look like they&#x27;re nice quality, but they&#x27;re not. They are heavy and they don&#x27;t cut properly.</li>
    <li> By no means did this product meet my expectations!!!  Returned the following day after receiving.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp and comfortable.  Perfect for frequent trimming of bangs (or fringe).</li>
    <li> Very nice thinning shears!</li>
    <li> The thinning shears work well for removing thickness from your hair. Make sure not to cut too close to the base of the head, but instead to cut at the tips.</li>
    <li> These scissors came very nicely packaged in a clear zipper pouch with a cleaning cloth. So far they have done their job well, although I&#x27;m still learning exactly what&#x27;s best for my hair. Each cut you make appears to remove about 1/4 to 1/3 of the hair. The scissors cut cleanly and feel sturdy in your hand. The finish also appears to be well-done and I don&#x27;t expect it to wear or rust anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I find that I always have some little piece that I want to fix after a haircut...sounds funny, but these are great.</li>
    <li> Thinned my hair once with these and i love them. I got sick of going to a stylist to have my hair thinned and it never being what i wanted and costing me 35 dollars a trip. so i bought these and theyre easy to use, and perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these once already and love them. They are a nice weight and feel sturdy in hand. I haven&#x27;t had time to abuse them and see how they hold up to doing and getting wet, but I&#x27;m pleased with this. Especially good product for the price!</li>

    <li> Nice thinning shears.  Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> These thinning shears work well and the seller sent them quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these scissors once a month, and loves them.  He cuts his  hair in a tapered fade, and these scissors help eliminate any line you might still see, and keeps the texture on the top looking great.  He also uses the gold digger vilian hair goop, and he hasn&#x27;t been to a salon in a long time!</li>
    <li> I was really encouraged to buy these scissors due to the great reviews. They came in great condition and I was extremely excited to use it. However when I tried it, I realized quickly how damaging these scissors are. Not only do they have the spaces in between one side of the blade (as a thinning scissor should), but they also have ragged points on the edge of the blade. This is where I find the problem. When I started cutting, I realized that all the hairs left on my friend&#x27;s head were bent and semi cut. It looked like that section of his hair was filled with split ends. This scissor damaged the section of hair I cut so badly that it looked like he had bleach-damage on his hair. It became brittle to the touch. I&#x27;ve used layering scissors before, but I have never experienced this. So disappointed that I returned it.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the money! Love these!</li>
    <li> High quality, fast shipping, great price.</li>
    <li> I will be away for an extended time and can now give myself my own haircuts. I wear a pixie cut, so this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Great scissors, great price!</li>
    <li> Some of the prongs at the end were squeezed together so it ripped my hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very helpful tool and not expensive.</li>
    <li> For such a price these scissors are great!</li>
    <li> Great Shears work well, and the shipping was fast. They really work quite well taking weight and such, would recommend to people.</li>
    <li> No surprises... Just simply works</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
