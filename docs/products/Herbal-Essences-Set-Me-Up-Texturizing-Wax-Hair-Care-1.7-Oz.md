      <li>Smells great!  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my hairstyle !</li>
      <li>and this has the best hold, with the sweetest, non stickiest smell.</li>
      <li>Even the best hair gel would stop working at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>Scent is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and makes me feel great about my hair!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product!  </li>
      <li>Love the texture this gives!</li>
      <li>Very important.</li>
      <li>Re-applying the product throughout the day just adds more texture without clumping or waxy build up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And I love the smell.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this hair product.</li>
      <li>Has the herbal essence fragrance that most people love.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing smell that lasts all day and night.</li>
      <li>and I was reading up on how I could manage them better without using a lot of hairspray and mousse.  </li>
      <li>I love the hold and texture</li>
      <li>Love this stuff...</li>
      <li>Because the Herbal Essence seemed to have better reviews, I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
      <li>This is the best hair wax I have ever used ...and I have tried several.</li>
      <li>I wash my hair, towel dry it as best</li>
      <li>this one in particular had good reviews on it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros- adds thickness,adds texture, increases volume, adds mild shine, adds moisture, washes out easily, smells good, weightless but solid hold, good for short-medium hair.</li>
      <li>When I used it, the product was incredibly sticky, more so than any other hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It has a light, clean, refreshing floral scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Fructis Style and it&#x27;s more like applying grease to your and quickly wears out.  </li>
      <li>Love,love,love this product-finally a product that work for fine hair and keeps it looking full all day.</li>
      <li>I bought this mostly because it was reasonably priced</li>
      <li>It makes my thinning hair look like a full head of hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s surprising to me that Herbal Essence texturizing wax is not marketed more heavily.</li>
      <li>Herbal Essences is really missing out on a great marketing opportunity by not selling a matching body spray.</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; has just the right mixture of stiffness and workability.</li>
      <li>The best way for one with thin hair to get volume -- just don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
      <li>I have very short, very fine hair</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s not stiff, I can&#x27;t run my fingers smoothly through it without giving up some of its hold.  </li>
      <li>for some reason I can&#x27;t find in on the local shelves any more..</li>
      <li>I can have frizzy or limp hair depending on the humidity and this product makes it look good all the time.</li>
      <li>Product works as advertised and in line with positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Not super stuff but holds and looks nice.</li>
      <li>My medium-wavy hair gets a number two on the sides with a fade, slightly longer on top with an equal amount off the top every month.  </li>
      <li>It had a gummy texture, and I had to really rub it between my fingers so it would spread out instead of all getting stuck in one spot on my head.</li>
      <li>I need a reasonably priced texturizing wax for my side swept bangs, and this one fits the bill.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another feature that I really like about this product is the fragrance.</li>
      <li>It was sticky and gummed up my hair and by the end of my day, my flyaways stood either straight up or straight out to the side.  </li>
      <li>I really like</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and flat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this keeps the cost down and enables potential buyers to discover the best kept secret on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons?</li>
      <li>thanks amazon for having this.. couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>Exact packaging, and EXACTLY the same ingredients, but almost twice the price!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had pretty ok luck with Herbal Essences in the past.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular hair wax, however, it could probably just be my hair instead of the wax.</li>
      <li>I will be buying this product again and recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>This texturizing wax i only need a nickles worth to make my hair fuller and its not sticky.</li>
      <li>This product is EXACTLY the same as the Pantene Wax.</li>
      <li>I like this natural look that gel never gave.  </li>
      <li>The product looks natural compared to hair gel.  </li>
      <li>After my hair dried I noticed that the hair on the back of my head where I used the most product felt like it had stuff stuck in it.</li>
      <li>But, I can  easily pat hair back down later in the day to shape it how I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I comb my hair straight down, let it dry for 2 minutes, comb it back, let it dry again for 2 minutes and pull the front forward with my fingers to get a spiky front look and pat the top forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wax tamed the spiky pieces and kept my hair looking good through the awkward growing out</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t harden too hard and stays just the right texture!</li>
      <li>The stylist cut my bangs too short and they stood straight up; I looked like a hair metal singer from the &#x27;80&#x27;s (not exactly the look I was going for).</li>

<li> If you flip the product over you see that you actually get a tiny amount of product; half of the packaging is just empty plastic to make it look bigger.</li>

<li> One time, it also saved me from a bad haircut!</li>

    <li> I need a reasonably priced texturizing wax for my side swept bangs, and this one fits the bill. When layered underneath hairspray, it gives my style a little extra staying power. One time, it also saved me from a bad haircut! The stylist cut my bangs too short and they stood straight up; I looked like a hair metal singer from the &#x27;80&#x27;s (not exactly the look I was going for). The wax tamed the spiky pieces and kept my hair looking good through the awkward growing out phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature that I really like about this product is the fragrance. It has a light, clean, refreshing floral scent. Herbal Essences is really missing out on a great marketing opportunity by not selling a matching body spray. If they made one, I would buy it in a heartbeat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback to this product is that it’s hard to find in stores, but one jar of this lasts a long time. I’ve had mine for about two years and have only used up half the jar!</li>
    <li> I am 50 and have short, thinning hair. This &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; has just the right mixture of stiffness and workability.</li>
    <li> I can have frizzy or limp hair depending on the humidity and this product makes it look good all the time.</li>
    <li> Love,love,love this product-finally a product that work for fine hair and keeps it looking full all day.Other products i have tried were sticky and only held for a short time.This texturizing wax i only need a nickles worth to make my hair fuller and its not sticky.I will be buying this product again and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Has the herbal essence fragrance that most people love. It&#x27;s a refreshing smell that lasts all day and night. Doesn&#x27;t harden too hard and stays just the right texture!</li>
    <li> Love the texture this gives! My hair is fine and flat. This wax gives a texture that I need. It&#x27;s light and makes me feel great about my hair!</li>
    <li> From $30/50 texturizers. You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- adds thickness,adds texture, increases volume, adds mild shine, adds moisture, washes out easily, smells good, weightless but solid hold, good for short-medium hair. Adjusting your look throughout the day couldn&#x27;t be easier. Lock your desired look in place. Set it and forget it. Re-applying the product throughout the day just adds more texture without clumping or waxy build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s surprising to me that Herbal Essence texturizing wax is not marketed more heavily. I&#x27;m sure this keeps the cost down and enables potential buyers to discover the best kept secret on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons? None. Although they should double the size currently offered. Very hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  It makes my thinning hair look like a full head of hair.  Unfortunately, I must be the only one to use it. Herbal Essence has discontinued this product and it is now difficult to find.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it to style his hair. Not super stuff but holds and looks nice. And I love the smell.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this hair product. I have very short, very fine hair and this has the best hold, with the sweetest, non stickiest smell. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my area, so I always buy it in bulk here when I see it.</li>
    <li> ...but it&#x27;s not for kinky hair. I tried it to style my hair in to twist but the hair wax is too thick for my hair type. And I do recommend it for those who do not have kinky hair.</li>
    <li> After just having cut my hair short again I needed something to style it for a job interview. I bought this mostly because it was reasonably priced and I&#x27;ve had pretty ok luck with Herbal Essences in the past. If you flip the product over you see that you actually get a tiny amount of product; half of the packaging is just empty plastic to make it look bigger. When I used it, the product was incredibly sticky, more so than any other hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It had a gummy texture, and I had to really rub it between my fingers so it would spread out instead of all getting stuck in one spot on my head. After I put it on I thought it seemed to be working alright, but my hair was still damp (product description said to use on dry hair...thank goodness I didn&#x27;t, it would have been a disaster). After my hair dried I noticed that the hair on the back of my head where I used the most product felt like it had stuff stuck in it. Gross! The other parts of my hair with less product looked terrible, like I had tried to use glue to style it. Dn&#x27;t buy this stuff, it&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product!  I&#x27;m unable to find it in any retail store.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Leaves my hair a tiny bit stiff.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of flyaway baby hairs and I was reading up on how I could manage them better without using a lot of hairspray and mousse.  I read that I could use hair wax and this one in particular had good reviews on it so I thought I would try it.  It was not how I expected it to be.  It was sticky and gummed up my hair and by the end of my day, my flyaways stood either straight up or straight out to the side.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular hair wax, however, it could probably just be my hair instead of the wax.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... for some reason I can&#x27;t find in on the local shelves any more..thanks amazon for having this.. couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I love the hold and texture this provides my hair. Scent is great. Allows me to create a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; look, or a faux hawk with no problems. Hair holds all day (and night), but is never sticky or hard.</li>
    <li> For years I used hair gel, but after using Herbal Essence Hair Wax, I stopped.  The product is really hard to find in the store.  It seems to be sold out everytime I go to buy it so I purchased an Amazon subscription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To understand why I like it, I&#x27;ll share some details:  My medium-wavy hair gets a number two on the sides with a fade, slightly longer on top with an equal amount off the top every month.  How I use it:  I wash my hair, towel dry it as best I can and apply a 2-pea size amount - it lasts me 1.5 months.  I comb my hair straight down, let it dry for 2 minutes, comb it back, let it dry again for 2 minutes and pull the front forward with my fingers to get a spiky front look and pat the top forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like is that product, in combination with combing down initially, practically gets rid of the wave in my hair.  Also, I don&#x27;t get a wet greaser look.  The product looks natural compared to hair gel.  I like this natural look that gel never gave.  By the end of the day, the product still works for me.  Even the best hair gel would stop working at the end of the day.  While it&#x27;s not stiff, I can&#x27;t run my fingers smoothly through it without giving up some of its hold.  But, I can  easily pat hair back down later in the day to shape it how I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Fructis Style and it&#x27;s more like applying grease to your and quickly wears out.  I really like Herbal Essences Hair Wax see myself using it for years.  My hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> The best way for one with thin hair to get volume -- just don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
    <li> No issues with delivery or product.</li>
    <li> This product is EXACTLY the same as the Pantene Wax. Exact packaging, and EXACTLY the same ingredients, but almost twice the price!  Because the Herbal Essence seemed to have better reviews, I ordered it.  I had already tried the Pantene, but was not happy with the results.  Neither product worked well for me. I have fine hair, but lots of it, and both of the products made my hair stiff and very hard to brush.  The style held, but I felt like my hair needed washing! No softness at all left in my hair</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hairstyle !</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised and in line with positive reviews. However, its odor is not what I have come to expect from Herbal Essences products....it smells instead like that of a tampon. I can&#x27;t explain it further it just does. I&#x27;m now left with the option of discarding it or using it until I run out, all the while smelling of feminine product. The fact that so little is required to manage my hair only compounds and extends the issue.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair wax I have ever used ...and I have tried several. Not too thick or sticky. Very important.</li>
