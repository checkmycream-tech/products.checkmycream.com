    <li> Phillips sonicare product Flosser, I can only surmise has dismal quality control.  My first Flosser handset went crazy and wouldn&#x27;t turn off, becomming overheated.  When replaced it was with a used unit  with only a 9 month guarentee, not specified when I received the product.  The airfloss heads would not stay connected to the hand set and had to be held in place during use.  I tried numerous new pics with the same results.  They refused to replace this as the nine months had elapsed. I quit using the product and have zero confidence in their products.  i think they are made with planned obsolesence despite there heafty price</li>
    <li> Works well...gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I would lIke to order in sets of 4 or 5. Great product</li>
    <li> Product as described - excellent replacement part.</li>
    <li> just a refill.  Had these for years.</li>
    <li> Came on time and were as expected. Fitted the philips Sonicare perfectly, no problems.</li>
    <li> They come in a small plastic bag, not original.</li>
    <li> They do a great job and I am persuaded by my dentist and periodontist to continue relentlessly. So I do, and these nozzles do the work for me.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product and I have enjoyed using it</li>
    <li> The same as original. Np cpmplaints.</li>
    <li> These last much longer for me than the recommended 6 months.  I don&#x27;t see any need to replace what isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> Seems the hole is bigger than my previous ones.  Less pressure.</li>
    <li> They work just like are other ones before they wore out.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these units (the actual WaterPik) and both died within two years.  These replacement tips also have a tendency to crack along the seam. That happened three or four times which is why I bought these replacements. This is not a good product and should be avoided.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Teeth and gums feel amazing everyday.</li>
    <li> it look like package so big. maybe you can use a smaller.</li>
    <li> Better than flossing.</li>
    <li> Does OK.  Could use more force.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> Always in need of replacements.</li>
    <li> right price and easy to order</li>
    <li> Blow away the nasty tooth germs and food particles. Blast and puff and do your stuff.</li>
    <li> good stuff and fast shipping</li>
    <li> As described, arrived quickly, works very well</li>
    <li> Just like the originals and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I shopped around for these replacement nozzles. I plan to use my Sonicare for a long time so having these extra nozzles saves me time and money. thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my older Airfloss.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use.  Stick with floss.</li>
    <li> I left my original one in a hotel room and immediately ordered a new one.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference and it works exactly the same as the one that came with my Airfloss.  I like that there are 2 in a pack, and the front of them are different colors for each individual&#x27;s use.  The product does what it says it does and came in a neat little lift lid box that I&#x27;m using to store some small items in!  Click away, pay and have a good day!!!  :)</li>
    <li> good replacement tips</li>
    <li> I use them twice a day, morning and night.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> No big deal just replacement tips. They work.</li>
    <li> What can I say, they work.</li>
