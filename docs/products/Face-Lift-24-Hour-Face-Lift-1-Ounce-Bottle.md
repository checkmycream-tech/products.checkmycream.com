### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is the greatest.  </li>
      <li>This product is incredible!  </li>
      <li>because within 3 days of re-using, my skin was corrected and great again.</li>
      <li>Its great</li>
      <li>so it seems to be a great moistuizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 35 with relatively good skin that is beginning to show signs of aging.</li>
      <li>While they are good skin care</li>
      <li>Some people may have good luck with it, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin, easily irritated, but not by this product.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I really love this product!</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to write a review, because the more people know about it, the more people will buy it and eventually the price might go up!  </li>
      <li>So far so good and glad I got a great deal too.</li>
      <li>I also am not to sure</li>
      <li>They are still mind you, but it is clearly much better.  </li>
      <li>I just gently massaged the cream in that line and it has done great work for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and am well pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Also, the pump top sticks, and it takes F O R E V E R to get the product out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re considering it for wrinkle reduction, keep in mind that it will help MINIMIZE THE APPEARANCE of wrinkles for the hours after you apply it (probably more like 8-12).</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels more taut and it works well with my face make up.  </li>
      <li>Good Stuff, really!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful moisturizer for dry skin in winter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 50s and have tried lots of moisturizers over the years and most of them have been fine.  </li>
      <li>(more important)</li>
      <li>Skin is smooth and supple feeling</li>
      <li>(the skin is \\&quot;filled up\\&quot; with water) and to hydrate the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 21, so I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve experienced its wrinkle reduction, but I can definitely see that the Hyaluronic Acid in this product works.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t tell you how great this product is, it virtually eliminates all the lines and sagging from under my eyes and it lasts all day long.  </li>
      <li>It certainly looks, feels, and smells good - just like the $10 face lotion I normally use.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think the bottle was full.</li>
      <li>Its safe and budjit wise less than BOTOX.</li>
      <li>This stuff works and the price is right (no pun. )</li>
      <li>But I have to admit I do notice a difference right away with this product and</li>
      <li>I noticed a huge difference right away, and after using it for two weeks I am ready to run back to the store to buy more.  </li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve been thinking about getting a dermal filler for laugh lines, thought I&#x27;d give this a try first.</li>
      <li>FaceLift and Facial Line Relaxer (in that order)and immediately noticed that my skin was softer and more pliable.</li>
      <li>I could tell a difference after the first use.  </li>
      <li>and it really does work very well!</li>
      <li>Thats what a customer wants.</li>
      <li>In fact, when my daughter (who hadn&#x27;t seen me in a couple of months) asked if I had had work done, I knew that this product really worked.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 48 and have noticed a significant increase in the fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes, as well as sagging of the skin, in the past year.  </li>
      <li>There are better products out there for less money that this one.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and maybe if I keep this up I won&#x27;t need to have \\&quot;work done!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>- I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to look younger - it really does work and I am so excited to find something under $40 that actually does what it says it does - A+++++ product</li>
      <li>Makeup goes on smoothly over it, too, there&#x27;s none of that flaking that you can get with other products.</li>
      <li>so naturally it doesn&#x27;t help as much as it did when I first starting using it___that</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to look old before my time!</li>
      <li>And as I am 75, people consistently guess my age 15-20 years younger.</li>
      <li>I wish I could see thru the bottle to know how much cream left though.</li>
      <li>every thing it says it will do ..hardly see any of the lines in my face anymore after two weeks use..I would recamend this product to any one who wants to look younger!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no better than any of the lower priced items available.</li>
      <li>this might have been worth $8.50 at Walgreen&#x27;s, but it was not worth the $40 I paid.  </li>
      <li>If you massage in the laugh line area long enough, you can actually feel the depth and length of the wrinkle.  </li>
      <li>A major setback I have</li>
      <li>The only thing is I am getting old (85)</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see changes in my wrinkles, but my pores reduced to the minimal after the first use.</li>

<li> A little goes very far and will probably last for about 4 months.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a long time and it works.  </li>
<li> Read reviews here, saw the price and went back and bought the other 3 packages in the bin.</li>
<li> Dry skin areas are gone.</li>
<li> If I apply this around the dry spots (after exfoliating!)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve researched the ingredients and they are quality; it is possible as my face further ages, this product might have a visible effect (not sure).</li>
<li> I have had absolutely no results from using it.</li>
<li> I did not get the results I expected from this product</li>
<li> Not really.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 days, day and night-and with in 3 days I saw my laugh lines (my worst area) fade significantly.  </li>
<li> The bottle will be nearly impossible to break open once the pump stops working (i.e. as I run out of cream, or if the pump breaks I&#x27;ll have no idea how much product is left).</li>
<li> I purchased this based upon the one review and also went to other sites on the internet for reviews.   </li>
<li> I purchased 24 hour facelift based on other user reviews.</li>
<li> After spending lots of money trying other products I picked up the 2-week starter kit, which includes the 24-hour face lift, on an impulse.  </li>
<li> and my skin dried out and started to flake and looked red and raw.</li>
<li> Basically it comes in an opaque hard plastic bottle with a tiny pump.</li>
<li> Its nothing wrong with the product--I;m just getting old!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any results.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
<li> I stopped using it after a few days.  </li>
<li> Thanks to the extreme winter, I&#x27;ve had terrible flaky skin on and around my nose and chin.</li>
<li> I called the company about this issue, and their Customer Service rep was very rude to me.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 weeks</li>
<li> mine aren&#x27;t that bad.</li>
<li> I had those ugly turkey neck wrinkles on my neck</li>
<li> IT WAS AWFUL!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wish I had my $30.00 back. This product did not work at all for me.  It didn&#x27;t even make my face appear any different.  I stopped using it after a few days.  There are better products out there for less money that this one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  I have had absolutely no results from using it. If there was a &#x27;0&#x27; star option I would have chosen it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based upon the one review and also went to other sites on the internet for reviews.   I am stunned at this product.  I had those ugly turkey neck wrinkles on my neck and I have been using it for approx. 2 weeks and I no longer have those wrinkles - my face looks years younger - I had no skin problems or reactions of any type - I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to look younger - it really does work and I am so excited to find something under $40 that actually does what it says it does - A+++++ product</li>
    <li> This stuff is the greatest.  I have been using it for several years. And as I am 75, people consistently guess my age 15-20 years younger. It also makes skin feel silky.  Good Stuff, really!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 weeks and it really does work very well! I could tell a difference after the first use.  It fills in the smallest lines and makes me look years younger!  I will continue to use this..I don&#x27;t want to look old before my time!</li>
    <li> I did not get the results I expected from this product - Face Lift in a bottle? Not really. Some people may have good luck with it, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see changes in my wrinkles, but my pores reduced to the minimal after the first use. I was looking for something like that forever. It has an east as one of  the ingredients, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s has a shrinking effect. Love it! I wish I could see thru the bottle to know how much cream left though.</li>
    <li> I DONT REMEMBER PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT PERHAPS IT WAS A GIFT SO I CAN NOT SAY ON THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s and have tried lots of moisturizers over the years and most of them have been fine.  But I have to admit I do notice a difference right away with this product and (more important) my friends have commented on my skin and asked what I&#x27;m using. My skin looks and feels more taut and it works well with my face make up.  I have also been using it on my neck as I am definitely sagging there and there IS a difference. In fact, when my daughter (who hadn&#x27;t seen me in a couple of months) asked if I had had work done, I knew that this product really worked.  I have very fair skin, easily irritated, but not by this product. Highly recommend and maybe if I keep this up I won&#x27;t need to have \\&quot;work done!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> About 6 months ago, I started using the Wrinkle Filling Serum, 24 Hour FaceLift and Facial Line Relaxer (in that order)and immediately noticed that my skin was softer and more pliable. In a matter of weeks, I was hooked. When my local Ulta was out of the products, I used something else and my skin dried out and started to flake and looked red and raw. IT WAS AWFUL! I ordered them off of Amazon and thank God I did because within 3 days of re-using, my skin was corrected and great again. I&#x27;m hooked for life, I may have to build an extra room on the house to stock up in case they ever go out of business.....</li>
    <li> I saw this at Kmart in the clearance bin for $8. Since I&#x27;ve been thinking about getting a dermal filler for laugh lines, thought I&#x27;d give this a try first. Read reviews here, saw the price and went back and bought the other 3 packages in the bin. I have used it for 2 days now and already notice a difference. Skin is smooth and supple feeling so it seems to be a great moistuizer. It does plump the nasal labia folds a bit and mine aren&#x27;t that bad. So far so good and glad I got a great deal too. Dry skin areas are gone. I really love this product!</li>
    <li> This product is incredible!  I&#x27;m 48 and have noticed a significant increase in the fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes, as well as sagging of the skin, in the past year.  After spending lots of money trying other products I picked up the 2-week starter kit, which includes the 24-hour face lift, on an impulse.  I noticed a huge difference right away, and after using it for two weeks I am ready to run back to the store to buy more.  I just can&#x27;t tell you how great this product is, it virtually eliminates all the lines and sagging from under my eyes and it lasts all day long.  Makeup goes on smoothly over it, too, there&#x27;s none of that flaking that you can get with other products.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to write a review, because the more people know about it, the more people will buy it and eventually the price might go up!  I&#x27;m 37 and have been using products like Obagi, Epicurean, skinceuticals and La Roche over the years-all cost a fortune.  While they are good skin care and I still use Epicurean, I have never seen a product reduce wrinkles and in such short time as this one! I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 days, day and night-and with in 3 days I saw my laugh lines (my worst area) fade significantly.  They are still mind you, but it is clearly much better.  If you massage in the laugh line area long enough, you can actually feel the depth and length of the wrinkle.  I just gently massaged the cream in that line and it has done great work for me.  I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well dose every thing it says it will do ..hardly see any of the lines in my face anymore after two weeks use..I would recamend this product to any one who wants to look younger!!!! Its great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and am well pleased with it.  The only thing is I am getting old (85) so naturally it doesn&#x27;t help as much as it did when I first starting using it___that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one.  Its nothing wrong with the product--I;m just getting old!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. Nope. It&#x27;s no better than any of the lower priced items available. Also, the pump top sticks, and it takes F O R E V E R to get the product out of the bottle. I called the company about this issue, and their Customer Service rep was very rude to me. I would never buy this product again, and would not recommend it to anyone. Just the opposite - DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works and the price is right (no pun. ) A little goes very far and will probably last for about 4 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21, so I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve experienced its wrinkle reduction, but I can definitely see that the Hyaluronic Acid in this product works. Thanks to the extreme winter, I&#x27;ve had terrible flaky skin on and around my nose and chin. If I apply this around the dry spots (after exfoliating!) in the morning and at night, the flakes are gone! Yaaay!    I&#x27;ve read a lot about skin products. Hyaluronic Acid makes a ton of water adhere to your skin- so that works to diminish wrinkles (the skin is \\&quot;filled up\\&quot; with water) and to hydrate the skin. This is a wonderful moisturizer for dry skin in winter. If you&#x27;re considering it for wrinkle reduction, keep in mind that it will help MINIMIZE THE APPEARANCE of wrinkles for the hours after you apply it (probably more like 8-12). It will not correct wrinkles- you&#x27;ll need a retinol product to do that. But this will help counteract the dryness of retinol AND help the appearance of surface wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased 24 hour facelift based on other user reviews. I&#x27;m 35 with relatively good skin that is beginning to show signs of aging. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any results. I&#x27;ve researched the ingredients and they are quality; it is possible as my face further ages, this product might have a visible effect (not sure). It certainly looks, feels, and smells good - just like the $10 face lotion I normally use. A major setback I have in addition to the price wihtout noticeable effects (and the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4) is that the packaging is bulky, inefficient, and wasteful. Basically it comes in an opaque hard plastic bottle with a tiny pump. The bottle will be nearly impossible to break open once the pump stops working (i.e. as I run out of cream, or if the pump breaks I&#x27;ll have no idea how much product is left). Also, you need to pump the thing 5-7 times to get enough substance to cover your face. If I&#x27;m going to pay $$, I want a container that is simple and allows me to squeeze every drop of the product onto my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time and it works.  When people notice that you look younger and compliment you.  Thats what a customer wants.Its safe and budjit wise less than BOTOX.</li>
    <li> this might have been worth $8.50 at Walgreen&#x27;s, but it was not worth the $40 I paid.  I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin after two weeks.  I also am not to sure but I don&#x27;t think the bottle was full.</li>
