      <li>These liquid eye liners so a great job, and it does not take a lot of practice to get the look I want.  </li>
      <li>This eyeliner really is great.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find n eyeliner with non-toxic ingredients, however, this product does tend to smudge and give the &amp;#34;raccoon eye&amp;#34; look by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of this!!</li>
      <li>They all precision applicators which is great for the perfect, precise line!</li>

      <li>4.5 stars out of 5 for this amazing, pigmented, liquid liner!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This liquid eye liner is AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>and it used to work amazing.</li>
      <li>I  really liked this liquid eyeliner a</li>
      <li>The color is nice and saturated.</li>
      <li>The applicator is very easy to use as well.</li>
      <li>Larenim also has great eyeshadow powders that are all natural too, beautiful shades as well...if you are looking. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I love liquid eyeliners; this works as well or better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with Zuzu Luxe (and the seller) for having a complete list of ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Stars for being honest and having relatively safe ingredients.</li>
      <li>Stars for being honest and having relatively safe ingredients.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>me say this first about this product, it is a great eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>so this helps to apply the eyeliner for a good cat eye look and helps  to apply another liner over it , helps if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand to draw a good line .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Goes on very smoothly, without smudging.  </li>
      <li>but the rubber tip is surprising easy and precise.  </li>
      <li>The color is nice, stays on well, and the applicator is fine.</li>
      <li>I have always used liquid eyeliners with a rubber tip, so I was glad this one also had a rubber tip and not a brush.</li>
      <li>I love the way I can blend it with a damp brush to get the look I want.</li>
      <li>This color is way better than taureg imo.</li>
      <li>I would prefer a brush for application, but many manufacturers have gone to a plastic applicator....</li>
      <li>I suffer from a lot of itchiness and irritation from most eye makeup products and like to wear a bit of makeup every day.</li>
      <li>and I love this.</li>
      <li>Why are you reading more of this?</li>
      <li>love the fact that applicator is more like a pen</li>
      <li>There is nothing more to write.</li>
      <li>I had to apply another liquid eyeliner over the coat of the eyeliner , for the color to have more of a glossy</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>This creates a lovely, watercolour effect, though.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s healthy for my skin.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t stop me from buying more though.</li>
      <li>The ZuZu Luxe liquid eyeliner is rated number one as the best product in my daily makeup regimen.</li>
      <li>Love the depth of color.</li>
      <li>I love the shape of the bottle</li>
      <li>/&gt;Looks great, works great, nice applicator that allows precision, overall I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Best liquid eye liner that I have found in a long time.</li>
      <li>I apply it in the morning and it looks perfect all day long.  </li>
      <li>Loved this eyeliner the first time I used it, and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since.</li>
      <li>The data information was listed as “fair” (“none” meaning there is no scientific literature and “robust” meaning there is substantial scientific literature supporting these concerns.  </li>
      <li>But my favorite part is the rubber-tipped applicator, which makes wing-tips easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I only wish that bush fit in this bottle and this product would be perfect!</li>
      <li>This is a great natural liquid eyeliner!</li>
      <li>I love that this is cruelty free, too.</li>
      <li>Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural alternative, and this one has been great.</li>
      <li>Omg i love this eyeliner soo much!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to liquid eyeliner, but I really liked this brand!</li>
      <li>The first liquid eye liner that I&#x27;ve fallen in love with!</li>
      <li>and I had to use my jojoba face oil to get it off, and then it came off easily onto the tissue</li>
      <li>It washes off easily though.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am very happy with this liquid eyeliner, it is worth the money since I know I am eliminating toxins in my cosmetics.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply with practice.</li>
      <li>goes on easily, stays on well</li>
      <li>This is fine if I&#x27;m just going to an event</li>
      <li>I think it works just fine, but sometimes it can get eyeliner on your eyelashes while applying.</li>
      <li>It went on just fine and lasted all day.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and stays put throughout the day, but washes off easily with water/oil cleansing.</li>
      <li>This is a great eyeliner that is pretty easy for me to manage when I&#x27;m careful putting it on and seems to be fairly impervious to the elements.</li>
      <li>I have tried tons of natural eyeliners and this one has the best formula thus far!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a beautiful deep rich color.  </li>
      <li>Very liquid-y, makes a nice smooth line.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth and is non-irritating.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh, chemical ingredients.</li>
      <li>Recommended for anyone looking for a cruelty free product.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and very matte looking.</li>
      <li>I love it so much!  </li>
      <li>This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had, better than more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>Will still continue to buy, but wish it had a more precise brush applicator instead of the large felt tip.</li>
      <li>I love that it has more natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Eye liner goes on smooth and stays fresh all day.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good products and I would buy again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I personally like this product very much and would highly recommend it! I prefer it by far to others because it does not contain as much poisonous ingredients as other eyeliners.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural liquid eyeliner! It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t flake off. It does tend to fade but only slightly. I have tried tons of natural eyeliners and this one has the best formula thus far! My only gripe is the applicator. It is so large and clumsy I cannot get a thin clean line with it! It just makes a mess! Instead I use the brush applicator that came with my Lavera liquid eyeliner which is very small and precise. I only wish that bush fit in this bottle and this product would be perfect! Unfortunately I have to switch between applicators every time I use it and waste a lot of product this way. Will still continue to buy, but wish it had a more precise brush applicator instead of the large felt tip.</li>
    <li> You never know with earth friendly cosmetics, but this eyeliner delivers a smooth, black line as good as any of it&#x27;s synthetic counterparts. The applicator is very easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner!</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner because it is Vegan and Cruelty-free. Those are my two &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34; when it comes to makeup.  The color is nice and dark. It stays on quite awhile but I find that it rubs off towrds the evening (8-10hrs after first applying). Overall, a good products and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a vegan eye liner, and this one had the best reviews. It works well and stays on well, and that is all that is really necessary for a liner. Recommended for anyone looking for a cruelty free product.</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I have used. It is very matte black, (I don&#x27;t like shiny on my aged eyes) and stays put all day long. I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; applicator, but I have an applicator from another liner that fits the tube, so I use that brush instead. I love that this is cruelty free, too. Overall, it is a winner.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Requires additional application after several hours, but very gentle, no eye irritation! Love the depth of color.</li>
    <li> The color is really dark just the way I like it and stays on all day. Will continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner really is great. I have used it before and thought it was irritating my eyes, but found it was the mascara I was using.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner is nice and dark, matter with no shine (which looks fantastic), applies easily and stays really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There can be some fading at the corners of the lids, but I find that if I put lighter face cream on and maybe some glycerin or aloe vera as a base, let it all set/dry, it doesn&#x27;t fade.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is in the middle for me is the brush. I think it works just fine, but sometimes it can get eyeliner on your eyelashes while applying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I get lots of compliments on how it looks.  I apply it in the morning and it looks perfect all day long.  It never irritates my eyes and the bottle lasts a long time.  When I notice that it is starting to dry out, I put one drop of water or saline solution in it.  I repeat this until I notice that the color is getting lighter.  It makes the bottle last weeks longer.  The best thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh, chemical ingredients.</li>
    <li> 4.5 stars out of 5 for this amazing, pigmented, liquid liner!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a matte black liquid liner. I&#x27;ve tried all the drugstore ones, Maybelline Line Stiletto, L&#x27;oreal Lineur Intense, ELF, etc. and the closest one for pigmentation was the Lineur Intense, but it had no lastability at all.&lt;br /&gt;The Zuzu eyeliner lasts nearly all day for me! I have extremely sensitive/watery eyes but on a good day, this product typically doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or come off.&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally though, I find that if I apply too closely to my waterline, the product irritates my eye A LOT and I end up crying off all the eyeliner. I do not recommend this for the waterline at all! At least for people with sensitive eyes like me. But that is A-OK because I usually use a pencil liner on my upper waterline, so not a problem at all. But yeah, the only reason i&#x27;m taking .5 off is just because of how irritated my eyes get when it&#x27;s on the waterline.&lt;br /&gt;Other users have complained about it taking forever to dry, but I don&#x27;t have that problem at all. But then again, &amp;#34;taking forever&amp;#34; is subjective lol :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best parts of this eyeliner are:&lt;br /&gt;- Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;- Super SUPER pigmented/black&lt;br /&gt;- The brush is AMAZING. Firm yet very flexible and pointed at the tip to create the perfect, sleek cat eye!&lt;br /&gt;- AFFORDABLE!!! The quality of this compares to all of the high end stuff but it&#x27;s about $3-$5 cheaper than it&#x27;s high end counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good liquid eye liner, let alone something not laden with chemicals.  Eye liner goes on smooth and stays fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I love how the eyeliner looks on my eyes, but it&#x27;s really hard for me to put on, so I normally use a brush to even it out. This creates a lovely, watercolour effect, though.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY liquid eyeliner I use.  Its skin friendly and just plain old awesome.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Omg i love this eyeliner soo much!!! all my eyeliners tend to crack or fade away this eyeliner applies so easy and dries so perfectly! i love it! im going to be buying this eyeliner again for sure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to liquid eyeliner, but I really liked this brand! I love that it has more natural ingredients. It went on just fine and lasted all day. My only complaint is how hard it was to wash off. I had black smeared all around my eyes. It won&#x27;t stop me from buying more though.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply with practice. Nice small brush.</li>
    <li> The first liquid eye liner that I&#x27;ve fallen in love with! I&#x27;ve been going natural with my beauty products and have just discovered the Zuzu luxe line.  This liquid eye liner is AMAZING.  I love it so much!  It stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t budge unless YOU budge it.  Smear is minimal, but expected.  I don&#x27;t put it on the lower lash line though.  It goes on so smooth and is non-irritating.  I&#x27;m so used to eyeliners irritating my eyes (stingy sensation, burning, and tearing up), so this was an unexpected relief!  Whew!  I love it...Its the best eye liner and I&#x27;ve tried so many kinds - YSL, Stila, Maybelleine, Urban Decay, etc. and this tops them all.  Only thing is, the eyeliner is not waterproof at all, barely water resistant.  It washes off easily though.  For the lower lash line, I use a little pencil.  Thanks Zuzu Luxe!!</li>
    <li> it was all over my face in a matter of 2-3 hours.  i tossed it right away - kinda bummed</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply, natural, non toxic, only need one coat, lasts all day and does not smudge.  Very affordable as well. I love it!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a more natural eyeliner that wasn&#x27;t a super hard pencil, this is great! goes on easily, stays on well, I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner because regular liquid eyeliner from commercial brands like Revlon and Maybelline stopped working so well for me. I used to buy waterproof, smudge proof/resistant, 24hr lasting...and it used to work amazing. Recently this one liquid eyeliner from Mabelline just smudged like crazy for me despite its usual waterproof formula...my eyes started to get more and more sensitive and watering a lot, and my eyeliner wouldn&#x27;t stay on...eyeliner is my trait, I use it like kohl...I decided to try something as close to organic and natural as possible. I ordered this right away and got it yesterday...and I love this. I wish I found out about it sooner. I put this on at 10:30am...it&#x27;s 10:30pm now and still on and no smudes whatsoever. I don&#x27;t know how other people put on liquid eyeliner, but I&#x27;ve used liquid eyeliner for over 10 years, and this stuff is amazing. I bought the Luxe Raven which is the matte black finish...gives me my dark kohl look that I love. Please don&#x27;t stop making this! This is way better than the crap I used to buy! I will be buying more of this!!</li>
    <li> The color is nice and saturated. But my favorite part is the rubber-tipped applicator, which makes wing-tips easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I wear contact lenses. This liner doesn&#x27;t cause irritation at all. I love the way I can blend it with a damp brush to get the look I want. It&#x27;s the only liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve found that I like.</li>
    <li> Zuzu luxe makes great eyeliner and mascara in my opinion, one of the best natural/vegan make up line on the market today.  This liquid eyeliner has a nice rich black hue that glides on very smoothly.  I had to get used to the rubber tip since I was using a brush tip before, just had to be careful not to poke myself in the eye but the rubber tip is surprising easy and precise.  The only improvement I would suggest is to make it more water resistant or better yet, waterproof because it you cry or walk in the rain, it will run.  Overall, I am very happy with this liquid eyeliner, it is worth the money since I know I am eliminating toxins in my cosmetics.</li>
    <li> The ZuZu Luxe liquid eyeliner is rated number one as the best product in my daily makeup regimen. Not only is the color extremely pigmented but it&#x27;s healthy for my skin.</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars because although I know it&#x27;s a matte finish, the dryness was a little hard for me in application. Maybe I just got a bad bottle, so obviously consult the other reviews, but I personally preferred the black pearl much more! They all precision applicators which is great for the perfect, precise line! Maybe I am just not a fan of matte liner, but this color for some reason, out of all of them, was the hardest for me to apply!</li>
    <li> When I bought Zuzu liquid eyeliner at a local natural products store it was fantastic. The brush was really precise--providing either a thin or thick line. When I ordered online I got a brush that was crooked, and the product seemed dry and clumpy,</li>
    <li> I  really liked this liquid eyeliner a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color shows more of matte black as opposed to a shiny black. I had to apply another liquid eyeliner over the coat of the eyeliner , for the color to have more of a glossy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that applicator is more like a pen so this helps to apply the eyeliner for a good cat eye look and helps  to apply another liner over it , helps if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand to draw a good line .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my skin had a bad reaction to I believe due to the matte part of the eyeliner since this is the second time i have tried a matte eyeliner and my skin will get a bad reaction , but I am glad I tried the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Goes on very smoothly, without smudging.  Doesn&#x27;t need much reapplication.</li>
    <li> My fav eyeliner. Does not irritate my eyes like other brands</li>
    <li> Smudges right off and did not stay on place, creasing in my lid.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is so great! I have always used liquid eyeliners with a rubber tip, so I was glad this one also had a rubber tip and not a brush. I love the shape of the bottle and it&#x27;s cool that you can set it down if you need to without risk of spilling it when applying your eyeliner. It is nice, dark, rich black. Very liquid-y, makes a nice smooth line. Dries after applying. Didn&#x27;t smudge. Natural ingredients! Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I love liquid eyeliners; this works as well or better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Ive never owned liquid eyeliner. The color is great it last all day. I will order this again. The price was acceptable and cheaper than most other high rated products.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyeliner that is pretty easy for me to manage when I&#x27;m careful putting it on and seems to be fairly impervious to the elements. When I took a shower at night after having it on all day it didn&#x27;t come off with my normal face wash and I had to use my jojoba face oil to get it off, and then it came off easily onto the tissue I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks great, works great, nice applicator that allows precision, overall I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had, better than more expensive brands. And it is natural and no harmful chemicals. I like it so much that I&#x27;ve bought another one even though I haven&#x27;t finished my current one.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner works the same as any other eye liner just without all the chemicals. I wear contacts and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Not only is it safe&lt;br /&gt;For your eyes it has worked better than other eyeliners I have used in the past!</li>
    <li> Best &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; liquid eyeliner on the market. It&#x27;s not an olympic swimmers eyeliner, meaning that it isn&#x27;t waterproof and it will definitely smudge if you mess with it. BUT if you use it with a silica setting powder, it WILL stay put. I&#x27;m really grateful for this product- I had searched all over the internet for a good natural liquid eyeliner and they are difficult to find. This is a repurchase for me.</li>
    <li> Nice eyeliner, exactly what I expected, a black liquid liner.</li>
    <li> Best liquid eye liner that I have found in a long time. The line  goes on so easily and makes cat eyes quick and painless; I&#x27;ve been cat eyeing since my days of ol in high school, so I feel like I can say that  with authority. It is not five star because it has a half day life. This is fine if I&#x27;m just going to an event but if I want it for all day I have to remove it and put itbon again because it smears and runs on my eye lid if I sweat even a little. Maybe if I invest in some make up sealer or whatever it&#x27;s called it would spare me the extra work and smearing.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any suggestions for a sealer please comment.</li>
    <li> These liquid eye liners so a great job, and it does not take a lot of practice to get the look I want.  I liked this so much I brought the brown, green and blue liners.  At first I had to get used to the stiff brush but once I got the hang of it, the line looks great and this liner lasts literally ALL DAY!  And it is non-toxic and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to love this. I&#x27;m actually still using it, refusing to give up. Bottom line, it gets all over your face whether you have oily skin or not. I&#x27;m also pretty sure that it&#x27;s made my eyes more irritated than less, which is interesting for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is great! It is super dark black and did not smudge/run/move at all day on a hot LA day. It goes on a little glossy but dries into a nice dark matte black. The brush is easy enough to use although it will take some getting used to, as with anything new. I suffer from a lot of itchiness and irritation from most eye makeup products and like to wear a bit of makeup every day. I do wear contacts. This did not cause any irritation whatsoever, so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a little smaller than I expected - so I will have to see how long it ends up lasting me.</li>
    <li> I love it! It goes on smoothly and stays put throughout the day, but washes off easily with water/oil cleansing.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner because it&#x27;s a natural formulation that doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of chemicals that I&#x27;m growing more sensitive to as I&#x27;m getting older.  For a natural eyeliner, I find it stays on well.  I don&#x27;t like the brush that comes with it however.  I &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; the product on to a flat eyeliner brush in order to apply it.  What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it&#x27;s a little pricey for the amount of product that you get.  If you use a lot of eyeliner, you may find that the product doesn&#x27;t last too long.  I wear my eyeliner the regular way - i.e., I don&#x27;t smear on a thick line or make dramatic &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It is a nice black and stays on well. It is very easy to use and very matte looking. There is nothing more to write. Why are you reading more of this? reader? reader what are you doing? reader? STAHP</li>
    <li> I like the lipstick from this company, and I&#x27;m not allergic to that. But this is made of natural products, and it still made my eyes very puffy the next day. Tried it a few times, just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t some other trigger, and it turned out the eyeliner was the allergen. Returned it.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find n eyeliner with non-toxic ingredients, however, this product does tend to smudge and give the &amp;#34;raccoon eye&amp;#34; look by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This color is way better than taureg imo. Doesnt fade red like taureg. Stays on well, unless you rub it. My eyes water a lot and this stays on well.</li>
    <li> I tried the brown and I love it, but the black one I got has a very stiff brush/felt tip, making it difficult and messy to apply. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural alternative, and this one has been great. Not waterproof, but when I also do a layer of dark purple eyeshadow underneath, it stays much better and looks REALLY good. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Loved this eyeliner the first time I used it, and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since. I use a primer with this liner so that it lasts at least 8 hours without running or smudging! Although, since it is a liquid liner, you have to be careful during application, not to get any of the liner on your lashes. Wipe your lashes off after applying this, so that it won&#x27;t smudge and get onto your bottom lid. Aside from that little inconvenience, this is a great product, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t be buying any other liner from now on.</li>
    <li> I have not worn eye liner for years because of allergies, however once you get used to the delicate brush, it comes out looking fine. Does not burn the hell out of my face which is a very big plus.</li>
    <li> Full., dark color for lining eyes.  Long lasting.  I would prefer a brush for application, but many manufacturers have gone to a plastic applicator....I guess it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!  Yes, vegan, but NOT one of those strange vegan  products of awful quality. You can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s the big V.  Glides on smooth and stays there all day long.  Don&#x27;t need a touch up.  Doesn&#x27;t peel off or run.  I bought Raven and it&#x27;s a beautiful deep rich color.  Gets a lot of compliments too.</li>
    <li> I always buy natural/organic make up. I bought this as my first liquid liner. I wanted to try the cat eye thing. But I suck at it. haha. Anyway... i use this as a delicate line under my lashes and smudge it up a bit before it dries. It leaves a really nice smokey effect and stays on perty good. Certainly not oil or sweat proof, not for me anyway... the corners of my eyes always need reapplication no matter what i wear.</li>
    <li> It´s really, really black! The brush is somewhat stiffer than im used to, but practise makes perfekt!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Loreal black liquid eyeliner for years, I like the felt tip loreal uses, I don&#x27;t like liquid eyeliners that use brushes.  I was nervous to try this product because the tip is hard rubber.  Zulu eyeliner rocks.  It stays on all day, the raven color is so black I love it.  To my surprise it was easy to apply, the rubber tip wasn&#x27;t as hard to use as I thought it would be, you do have to get used to using this type of tip if you are used to a felt tip or a brush though, I can&#x27;t get over how black the color is, this is far darker and sharper in color then loreals black liquid eyeliner.</li>
    <li> My daughter is allergic to any brand of eyeliner even the organic/vegetable-made ones.  Her eyes swell and itch.  This is the only brand she could use.  Thanks goodness I found this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite eyeliner I&#x27;ve used. It goes on well, and lasts a long time. It looks a little more natural than many of the other liquid eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried which is nice.</li>
    <li> Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sorbitol, Cetyl Alcohol, Iron Oxides, Mica, Jojoba Oil, Bentonite, Bisabolol, Tocopherol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Eyebright Extract, Titanium Dioxide, Cellulose Gum, Hectorite, Grapeseed Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say this first about this product, it is a great eyeliner.  The brush is firm and is fairly easy to apply.  It does need a little time to dry, but I don’t think that is much of a problem.  It stays on, even when my eyes water, when I sweat and yes, when I cry.  I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product ingredients.  I am very happy with Zuzu Luxe (and the seller) for having a complete list of ingredients.  This was one of the reasons why I chose this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description states that “6 gentle and non-irritating liners…” so I checked each of the ingredients and the product rating on EWG.org.  EWG.org only had their 2009 formulation, but it matched the ingredient list on Amazon.  Here is what EWG.org had to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall score for this product is a “2” out of a possible 10.  The scale goes from 1 (low hazard) to 10 (high hazard) and the score is averaged on the scores for each ingredient.  However, it also indicates that the data collected was limited and information on the potential toxicity for each ingredient was limited.  In general, the high concerns listed were enhanced skin absorption, additive exposure sources, persistence and bioacculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one ingredient with the highest rating (3) was lecithin.  It is shown to have enhanced skin absorbs ion, multiple additive exposure sources and contamination concerns (Nitrosamines-the presence of nitrosating agents) and use restrictions.  The data information was listed as “fair” (“none” meaning there is no scientific literature and “robust” meaning there is substantial scientific literature supporting these concerns.  A three places in the middle).  It was rated as having no potential for allergies and immunotoxicity (but again there was limited data).  I usually look at the first three or four ingredients to give me an indication on how safe it is.  In this case water, sorbitol, cetyl alcohol and iron oxides have low to moderate health concerns (of course water being benign).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with the products ingredients and that they have a low potential for causing an allergic reaction.  That said, each person is unique and while one chemical may not cause problems for one person, it could very well cause an allergic reaction in another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars for being honest and having relatively safe ingredients.I usually look at the first three or four ingredients to give me an indication on how safe it is.

    <li> The color is nice, stays on well, and the applicator is fine. I am very sensitive to commercial makeup, I suppose due to allergies. At one point I even got an eye infection from a sensitivity to eyeliner and an eye cream, ewe! After that I threw everything away and went as natural as possible. I missed eyeliner though, this is the perfect fit. It doesn&#x27;t make me itch and I have had no weird issues from it. Larenim also has great eyeshadow powders that are all natural too, beautiful shades as well...if you are looking. &#x3D;)</li>
