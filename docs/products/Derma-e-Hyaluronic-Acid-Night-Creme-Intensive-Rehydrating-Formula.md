<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use the night crème for night and a little less for day. Keeps my skin hydrated 24/7.</li>
    <li> I first bought it in the Vitamine Shoppe, and then decided to save some money buying it at the amazon. It is the same good product here. Smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The cream has very useful ingredients in it and looks like it is very easy on parabens. Feels so very nice on the skin. And the price is good. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Best night  cream .Goes on smoothly.I&#x27;ve tried others but this one is the best .</li>
    <li> I have such dry skin I use it AM and PM.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face and backs of my hands plump up which helps with disguising my wrinkles. It also makes my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> I would buy again.  Good creme and at a fraction of cost for big name cosmetics</li>
    <li> After going on Accutane years ago, I never break out.  Yet somehow this baby did the trick.  Face was a mess, even with cysts.  Too bad because I love this brand.  I&#x27;ve now gone back to my fave, which is their DMAE, C Ester, and Alpha Lipoic Cream.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CREAM FOR THE PRICE. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. IT SINKS INTO THE SKIN IMMEDIATELY AND IS NOT GREASY AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and the day cream) for several years now and I just love everything about it.</li>
    <li> After reading the product reviews, I purchased my first Derma-e product.  I have been using the Hyaluronic Acid Night Creme for about a week and already I can tell and feel an incredible difference in my skin.  My skin feels refreshed and the tight line wrinkles on my forehead are starting to vanish!  There is a strong floral smell to it that reminds me of a very, very fragrant lei.  The smell however does not linger and after you disperse it on your face you hardly notice the scent at all.  I&#x27;m very happy with my Derma-e experience and definitely plan to try other products.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and love it.</li>
    <li> I have both oily and dry flaky patches on my face. At first I thought it would just make my face super greasy and shiny which I hate, but after two weeks of using it I already see a huge difference in my face. My skin feels smooth and the dry patches have gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid using this during the day. I did it once and my face was shiny/oily all day. This stuff is meant to be on all night.</li>
    <li> I need to stress how light and clean this moisturizer smells. I am very sensitive to scent, and often will wind up with a migraine if I&#x27;m around one that doesn&#x27;t agree with me for even a few minutes. I&#x27;ve handed over countless moisturizers to my mom for this reason- often ones that I had high hopes for, and spent between $10 and $30 for! But the derma e does not give me this problem! On a side note: I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s a heavy moisturizer, but sometimes it does feel like it takes a while to completely absorb into my skin- it has not, however, caused me to break out. It&#x27;s just odd. Overall this is my new favorite moisturizer, and I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
    <li> Love this creme, however the last one I ordered was missing the HA, wasn&#x27;t on the label. Will be sad if it has been removed for good.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing amazing face cream. Its so rich and moisturizing. It makes my face feel so good. Its a really quality night cream and my face feels so soft in the morning after putting it on.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting a free sample in a beauty box and really enjoying it. This moisturizer soaks in quickly which sometimes feels like it&#x27;s not heavy duty enough for winter. However, within a week my dry skin started to dissipate. It would appear it&#x27;s working even though it feels lightweight- which I suppose is ideal!</li>
    <li> Every derma e product I have tried is wonderful and this one is my favorite. Rich but not too heavy and very hydrating.</li>
    <li> Derme E products are very good and I like the Night Creme as well as their Day Creme.  This creme hydrates skin well and it lasts! I no longer have dry skin in the winter at all. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite product! I love the smell of it, it is very light for a night cream, but the effect is amazing! After using it for just a few days, the skin looks firm, plump and healthy. But that is not all, the next morning, the skin still feels as soft and moisturized as it did the night before! I highly recommend this for anyone (and the hyaluronic eye cream, of course), no matter what your age or skintype is. All skin needs moisture.  If you have mature skin, I also recommend the peptides plus cream. I use peptides plus in the day and hyaluronic at night, and the combination works very well.</li>
    <li> Am happy with this creme.......</li>
    <li> I chose to buy this product because I tried the expensive one with no big differences. So I read about this one and encouraged to buy it. I&#x27;ve been use it for 5 months with good result in decreasing the lines on my face but not diminishing it, it is well moisturizer too. So I signed up on automatic delivery.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, I&#x27;ve used many products.  I like the derma e because a small amount is all that is necessary, without going on greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid is necessary for skin repair and works when you sleep.</li>
    <li> Do not publish name. It is great for someone who had lots of radiation. Skin keeps soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream for 9 months now. It gave immediate results in terms of softer and younger looking skin. Over time, the results seemed subsided or not as apparent any more. It may be that it&#x27;s in a maintenance mode now. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Have used creams double/triple+++ the price that don&#x27;t work as well as this one.</li>
    <li> My favorite by far! Smells great and leaves my face moiturized but not oily or too wet.</li>
    <li> The cream itself is adequate but the odor is very strong and unpleasant.  I disliked applying it and having to smell the odor (I couldn&#x27;t hold my breath long enough for the odor to dissipate) and while I became unaware of it after a time, my SO was clear that he would not sleep in the same bed if I were wearing the cream.  I couldn&#x27;t blame him.  It was pretty disgusting.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a real significant difference yet using this product.  I understand why it is a night creme as it tends to make my face oily. Has been helpful at controlling peeling after use of salicylic acid peel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week.  I didn&#x27;t originally intend to by this product, but got swayed when I went to purchase the eye cream and many others had purchased this.  I am very pleased so far.  It may be psychiatric, but I do feel that I am seeing changes in my face.  My skin feels much firmer.  I am 23 years old and got the eye cream for crow&#x27;s feet, without much concern for other parts of my face.  So, with thinking that I didn&#x27;t have much to work on but still seeing differences with this?! I think that&#x27;s pretty good!  P.S. I recommend the eye cream as well ;)</li>
    <li> There are a lot of different things to like about this cream.  I am partial to the off-white color, the creamy texture, and the great mix of all-natural ingredients.  These are some of the foundations for a great cream, but what I think I like most about this is the smell.  I have never smelled anything like it and it is fantastic.  It&#x27;s a clean, refreshing, and perfected smell.  I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m usually not one to care for scents.  But it&#x27;s like this one doesn&#x27;t TRY to smell good just for the glamour of it and to sell more products.  THIS one smells good indirectly, as a byproduct of the pure quality and care.  The scent to me is a promise provided by Derma e, an assurance that my face will look as good as the thing smells, as I accept it as a fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a long time to convince myself to invest in this particular product even though I love the brand as a whole.  I am definitely glad I did.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used in years.  I work with a group of estheticians and have access to many lines of high end products.  Still, this moderately priced creme does the job.  There is no unpleasant odor or greasy texture nor lengthy beauty routine required. Great product.</li>
    <li> Uugghh! I am never allergic to ANY facial products, but this one made my neck only break out on itchy hives! Why not my face? Who knows, now I&#x27;m using cortisone cream on my neck...it&#x27;s embarassing! Check the packaging, they do say to do a patch test first....hhmmm they must know something!!?</li>
    <li> it was a waste of money, only could use in my hands not in my face, developed bad redness... maybe I was allergyc.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent face cream for night time. It is thick and leaves my face with moisture in the morning. It may not be good for oily skin though as it is really thick. It is really thick but it is excellent for dry skin. I love it and it protects my face against the wind too which is a great bonus! I will definitely buy more when needed and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t seemed to do anything for the fine lines but the smell is nice so will use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I could not use this.  Every time I would try to use this cream it would cause my face to turn red and peel.  My skin may be too sensitive but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great nigh time product for aging-up 45+ in years. Applies well does not leave film on pillow.</li>
    <li> While many so-called moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;mes (at a much higher price) promise to plump skin and diminish wrinkles, Hyaluraonic Acid Night Cr&amp;egrave;me does just that. This form of hyaluronic acid in a cr&amp;egrave;me is strictly for nighttime use.  It is thicker and when first using it the application feels like glue - for a few minutes. The presto! The cr&amp;egrave;me is absorbed leaving the face (and those troublesome age spots on the hands and arms) restored for the night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other ingredients in this cr&amp;egrave;me are Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid; Actimoist Bio-2), Calcium Ascorbate (Ester-C), Dimethicone, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract*, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Allantoin, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer (Aristoflex), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Plumeria Blossom Fragrance The company is pretty straight forward in telling you what exactly you&#x27;re getting. And with nightly use it works to freshen aging skin. Very fine product. Grady Harp, July 13</li>
    <li> Having tried a spectrum of products at every price, this is the first cream to effect any noticeable difference or improvement. I have received more compliments on my skin in the last few months than the last 15 years.  Also, more than a few acquaintances have posed questions about what has caused my appearance to change -- more rest, new job, etc.?.  I am astonished.  Derma E is IT.</li>
    <li> It is always difficult to find good natural skin care products that work.&lt;br /&gt;My Mom, myself and my sister-in-law - we all have different skin types, and we are obviously different age groups, and we&#x27;re all enjoying this particular Derma e creme. So far we used Day, Night and the eye cream. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy. My skin is sensitive and combination, and My Moms is dry, so usually I go with  lighter creams or I would break out, and my Mom needs heavier stuff. This creme however works for both of us, she said her skin feels soft and hydrated and mine feels the same.&lt;br /&gt;We are very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I really like this night crème.  I think it works as well as the high priced night creams.  I have reordered it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rich and makes my skin feel smooth and has Hyaluronic Acid in it which is supposed to be good for the skin.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff. My skin is smooth as a babies butt and firm and I&#x27;m turning 40 this year and this came at just the perfect time. I am faithful at putting it on every night and it sure has paid off. I read the reviews just before Christmas and I was sold. Sure glad I did. I also recommend the peptides plus cream. I use peptides plus in the day and hyaluronic at night as well. They smell great! I&#x27;m going to order more so I am sure not to run out. I have also started using the non scented hand and body lotion which I like and it has no parabens which are suppose to be bad bad bad. I am going to order the Mango? I think it is body lotion and give it a try. I&#x27;ll post a review when I do. Way to go Derma E. I am spreading the word.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about two weeks now, and I think my skin looks a bit smoother (but I&#x27;ve also been peering closely into the mirror hoping it&#x27;s getting smoother). It goes on nicely and absorbs well.  However, I can barely stand using it because of the smell.  I&#x27;m shocked other reviewers said they liked it, and one person said it smelled fruity - to me, it smells very medicinal!  In fact, it smells like kid&#x27;s chewable Tylenol (random, I know, but that&#x27;s exactly what the smell reminds me of).  I realize that smell is a personal and subjective thing, but I feel like I should give a warning.  It&#x27;s been sitting on my shelf for months unused since I just can&#x27;t take the smell.</li>
    <li> Good product. Safe and beneficial. Lovely smell without using chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a couple of months, and it&#x27;s a pleasure to slather it on at night. It disappears into my skin, leaving it soft and supple until morning and beyond. I had been ignoring my skin for some time, and really noticed a big difference in texture with the very first use of Derma e Hyaluronic cream. Now, after many nights, I think my skin looks much fresher, less sallow, yes I guess younger. It is certainly silkier, and an added benefit, I have had no trouble with breakouts, when that use to be a frequent problem. This cream does smell fruity, vaguely of bananas? But I don&#x27;t mind, and the scent goes away quickly. Derma-e knows skin care. And it&#x27;s free of nasty chemicals to boot.</li>
    <li> LOVE this cream!!  Love, love, love it!  My middle aged skin drinks it in like cool water on a hot day. I love the way it feels, smells and I love the way my skin looks in the morning!!  Amazing value for such a high end cream!  This brand never disappoints!!</li>
    <li> Just cream. I thought it was supposed to ease wrinkles. It is just another face cream and I face the same face in the mirror every morning.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I also had the experience that after cleaning my face and then using the cream there was always a white flaky residue on my skin.  Why that happens..I don&#x27;t know. I never experienced something like that with a facial cream. Also putting the cream on my face feels a little weird. My skin absorbs it immediately but at the same time it feels like having wax on my face.   I am not sure whether the cream has a positiv effect on my skin, at least I have not noticed anything yet. So, I will continue to use it since I now have it, but I am not sure whether I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Hydrates my face well.</li>
    <li> I love Derma E products...But this wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me. It left my skin feeling dry &amp; itchy ...wasn&#x27;t enough moisture for me.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and it does leave my skin feeling soft and dewy for about an hour after I put it on.  It doesn&#x27;t last and I wake up with dry skin but hey I still use it every night and like I said I LOVE the smell of this stuff.</li>
    <li> The best one I&#x27;ve found yet...as soon as I use this one up, I&#x27;m going to order more...</li>
    <li> I was using Hydroxatone before I tried this, which was three times the cost, and this works just as well.  I use it along with the Peptide eye serum and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this creme last month and love the fresh non greasy way my skin looks and feels. In fact I liked this product so much I have just bought another jar and the day creme. I am a firm believer in the benefits of hyaluronic acid after having a series of knee injections of hyaluronic acid. It feels natural. My skin seems to benefit as much as my knees. I really love this product and will be a lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product.  I like all the derma e products.  However, my skin is extremely dry, so I mix a little derma e&lt;br /&gt;vitamin e cream with this product during the winter months</li>
    <li> This cream clogged my pores but so does every lotion other than Eucerin. I gave it to my husband who loves it other than the smell. Some people on here say there isn&#x27;t a smell it is a light smell. Well I have a very sensitive nose and the smell is nice but a tad overwhelming upon application. Not sure why Derma a put a scent in it when everything else they do has no scent but none the less the cream was not for me BUT husband likes how it makes his skin feel.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin that is beginning to show the signs of aging- especially around the eyes and between the brows.  This cream made my skin look more plump (fewer lines) the first night of use.  I was delighted the next morning.  I have always had a hard time finding facial moisturizers that adequately moisturize my skin without causing a reaction or breakout.  This did neither. My skin is well hydrated and looks better with no adverse reaction.  I would definitely recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> The reviews were pretty positive about this product, so I gave it a try.  After using it a couple of nights my family commented on my natural glow and how nice and clear my skin looked.  For the price you really should try it.  It feels and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item many times and will continue to do so. Its the most moisturizing night cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. It has a mild but pleasing scent. So many others are oily or overly scented. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> DERMA E HAS PROVIDED SOME MAGIC IN A JAR---ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WITH VERY DRY SKIN--I SIMPLY LOVE HOW  HYALURONIC  ACID (A VERY STRONG WORD BUT GENTLE TO THE FACE)  FEELS AND WORKS--BEST TIME IS NIGHT TIME WHEN YOU ARE SLEEPING--I ALSO USE IT IN THE AM AS WELL--VERY WELL PRICED AT AMAZON--I&#x27;M HOOKED!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product every night.  So far no impovement, but it might be my skin and not the product.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night after I wash my face and find it to be very good to my skin.  I have sensitive skin, but I have no problem with leaving this product on my face, as it does not contribute to break outs.  I also put it on my eye area for extra moisture there.  I love this product so much that I have already purchased it twice and will continue to purchase it.  A little goes a long way, so it is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite skin cream.  It hydrates better than anything else I have tried.  I use it both morning and night.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for two years now and find it to &amp;#34;do the job.&amp;#34; There are so many night creams on the market that it&#x27;s hard to compare the better ones. But this is certainly among the better ones.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It leaves my skin so nice and healthy and smooth. I couldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been using a $350 cream plus a $99 serum and I am not joking this derma e for my skin is better, my skin seems to  drink it and my skin feels so soft and fresh I even forgot to put my moisturizer on in the morning after I had a shower and was shocked because normally my skin would feel so parched without moisturizer ... a winner and especially as it is very affordable!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t avoid the fact that my skin was left with flakes around the chin area sometimes because of the cold weather.  I am using the half container left as a body lotion.     This product is paraben-free and propylene glycol-free.       Made in the US</li>
    <li> 5 stars...........for sure. Great scent and a product&lt;br /&gt;which improves the texture of my skin.......&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy it again...........Go Derma e and Amazon for carrying the product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new natural night cream without any harsh chemicals. I have very sensitive skin and most night creams clog my pores and cause break-outs. From the moment i tested this one on my finger, I knew it would be different. Its very lightweight. It goes on and absorbs very easily, which is a problem I have with many with a lot of the more natural night creams. Nourishing, moisturizing goodness for those wrinkles that are starting to appear. I think its even helping with blemishes. I&#x27;m hooked! I purchased it at Whole Foods, but I&#x27;ll probably reorder here.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer of all time! I have acne prone skin and in the winter, my skin gets dry and peely. Nothing was helping until I tried this! It keeps my skin hydrated and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It&#x27;s not greasy or unpleasant smelling. A+!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I like everything I get from Derma E.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  My face definitely looks firmer.</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream that I have used.  I have very dry skin and this night creme has helped it dramatically.  Will continue to use as long as I can find the product.</li>
    <li> This cream leaves your face feeling very soft and has a lovely light scent.  I usually stay away from scented face creams but have had no problems with this one.</li>
    <li> There seems to be agreement in the beauty community that hyaluronic acid is probably the best panacea for aging skin; unfortunately this stuff is usually very exensive.  This product combines a moderate price with an amazing result.  I have never found another face creme that works as well as this one.  I use it under foundation instead of mosturizer as well as at night; it keeps skin from flaking and smoothes the little lines.  Ldies start using this before your skin falls apart.</li>
    <li> derma e makes great skin care products.  i instantly noticed improvement with the skin tone of my face.  it also moisturized my face and made my skin feel more taut and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> This creme left a flaky residue on my face after use. It actually was worse than my regular cremes. I bought this along with the day creme and that wasn&#x27;t any better. I was really hoping for something more. I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t really expensive. I gave it to my mother b/c I know that her skin is extremely dry. She said that it helped a little, but no more than any other creme she&#x27;s tried.I gave it one star b/c the smell was pleasant.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and was hoping for a miracle I guess. This did nothing as claimed. I used it for a month and couldn&#x27;t tell that it was used at all.</li>
    <li> I love all of derma e&#x27;s moisturizers! They are inexpensive and a quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a skincare expert, and I am more concerned with the ingredients being natural than I am with the ultimate affect on my skin.  It seems that no matter what I put on my skin - from a blend of oils to much more expensive products - seem to have a similar result of moisturizing my skin, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seems to be different in that after I wash my face in the morning, my skin remains really soft and almost velvety!  It actually feels like it \\&quot;did\\&quot; something overnight.</li>
    <li> I have gotten compliments on my complexion twice since using the Night Creme. I sometimes use it in the daytime too. I like the way it makes my face feel and look.</li>
    <li> This works as well as costly products. My skin loves it.</li>
    <li> Still useing so far so good</li>
    <li> I like this product for moisturizing.  I would buy it again.  Do not get it too close to eyes if you have sensitive eye skin.</li>
    <li> The derma e Hyaluronic Acid Night Crème, 2-Ounce container was a great addition to my skin care line-up. Excellent item.</li>
    <li> Love this product... my skin feels so hydrated since I started using it a few weeks ago.  Also recommend the microderm scrub from derma e... Definitely will reorder when the jar is done.</li>
    <li> It may say night cream, but I use it as my day cream.  It is not heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I love all derma e products. Nothing else has ever left&lt;br /&gt;My skin so soft and perfect. Suggest all derma e products.</li>
    <li> I have been buying from Amazon for years and never wrote a review but need to now because I love this creme. Bought the microdermabrasion scrub before from derma e so figured I&#x27;d try this. I have used it only three days and notice firmer, more moisturized skin. Prior to this I have used many of the expensive skin care lines and none work like this. My skin just looks better! Am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Love this, use it every night.  Can&#x27;t say it has made me look 20 years younger but it sure has made my face feel good and that it the point in it.  Great Creme.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. It does have a bit of a fragrance to it that I was not sure I would like, but after about fifteen minutes it mostly disappears. But my 58 year-old skin drinks it in and everyone comments about how young I look and are shocked to hear my age. Have also used the NOW brand of this, but does not seem to moisturize as well although I definitely like the light orange-y fragrance of that one much better. I try to wash my face earlier so the fragrance disappears before I go to bed so I don&#x27;t get it on my pillows.</li>
    <li> I live in Colorado and am in my 50&#x27;s. This cream hydrates really well and the price is so reasonable I can put it on several times a day. Makes my skin feel soft and moist.</li>
    <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a good smell. Smeared well. Absorbed too. Super moisturizing not noticed. Normal night moisturizer.Will buy again</li>
    <li> Love the night cream, I use it on my neck and chest also. Very hydrating, smooths wrinkles in 3-4 weeks.  Would be even better without the scent.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful, smells nice, makes my skin feel so soft, moisturizes instantly... what more can i say? If I know I won&#x27;t be in the sun much, I will use it during the day too. My face is always dry when I get out of the shower. I look forward to quenching my skin&#x27;s thirst with this moisturizing cream. My skin looks better than it has in the past after using derma e products. The ingredients are not scary at all and the price is right. I will buy again, and again, and again.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It is quickly absorbed by my skin and leaves it feeling soft (but not sticky or greasy). It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Could not give 5 star rating as have not used product long enough, so far totally satisfied and will keep using.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this product really helps. It is non greasy and makes my skin feel less tight and dry.</li>
    <li> Finally, a cream that works.  I&#x27;ve had very dry skin since menopause and have tried everything including olive oil and advocado oil.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, not greasy and not only moisturizes my skin but makes it so soft to the touch.  I&#x27;ve reordered more to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product previously from another seller but reordered it at Amazon when I ran low, as I had to pay shipping at the other seller.  This is called &amp;#34;Night Cr&amp;egrave;me&amp;#34;, but as I have very dry skin and read that hyaluronic acid is a humectant that draws moisture to your skin from ambient air, I use it every morning.  I wait and fix my hair before putting on foundation.  It is fabulous and when I wash my face at night I can feel moisture still on my face.  I don&#x27;t use it at night however as it doesn&#x27;t soak in quickly (seems natural for a product designed to pull moisture from the air) and just ends up on the pillow case.</li>
    <li> This is very hydrating mositurizer I use it both day and night. Does not cause me to break out or clog my pores. But I need something to balance my skin tone will have to see the other products by derma E.</li>
    <li> I have used for almost two weeks now and has done nothing for my skin yet. Before ordering I had read the reviews and was convinced this would be the right product for me, however Im VERY VERY  dissapointed. In the meanwhile I will continue to use it to convince myself but if not I will not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I originally ordered it because I was looking for a night cream called VITA-DERM and a facial serunm called AQUA LIFT, which combined did wonders for my skin but have not been abe to find them again. If anyone knows of these products please post the info. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I did a very long intensive search regarding all of the old and new products that are supposed to protect or correct cosmetic facial issues. There are plenty of articles out there but look for the ones by the dermatologists who are not trying to sell anything. I then compared products - Expensive and NOT - and found these on Amazon with the same identical components as the more expensive ones sold at cosmetic counters or even in (or especially in!) the dermatologists&#x27; or plastic surgeon&#x27;s offices. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product as well as a few others I plan to review today.</li>
    <li> Blends in ...light and comfortable..I even use during the day sometimes.</li>
    <li> I could not give this cream much of a chance to work on my face, because the fragrance was too strong to keep it on.  I know that I am sensitive to strong fragrances, but took a chance on this product even after seeing another comment on it.  On the third night of use, I got up and washed it off in order to get to sleep.  The price was so reasonable through Amazon, however, that I will not return it.  Maybe I will try using it on my feet, because it has all the great ingredients needed for skin repair, but will have to wash it off of my hands after application.</li>
    <li> I noticed I was about to run out of this last night and panicked! This night cream is truly a miracle worker. I have always had trouble with red, splotchy skin, and this has really helped to solve those problems. I smooth it on liberally at night and don&#x27;t even need a day cream in the morning. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Been using Night Creme for 17 nights tonight.  Didn&#x27;t puff up my face.  Lines still sitting there and refusing to budge.  Did absolutely NADA for puffiness under the eyes.  BUT, one good thing about it is my face is much softer but girls that is it!!!&lt;br /&gt;It does feel good after application.  I will continue to use this product until I discover something better.  Previously, I was using Lancome Renergie Lift Multi-Action which cost $68.00 a jar.  Waste of money too - NO lift.  The derma e Hyaluronic Acid Night Creme, must confess feels better on face than the Lancome product.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite, so natural and it leaves my face hydrated and smooth.</li>
    <li> Not very moisturizing . I&#x27;ve used other brands that were better and around the same price. I had high hopes for this one and it just wasn&#x27;t quality .</li>
    <li> Oh wow. I&#x27;ve purchased other products from this line and they worked well. So I decided to try this one for moisturizing my face and neck at night.  It works way better than the $150 face cream I had. Only wish it came in a full body version.</li>
    <li> I have used it every night for weeks, no change so I am not so sure about this night crème.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on any Derma E product.  I have tried many of them and every one ends up replacing other over priced skin care lines... not sure how they do it, but their products are very good buys and are wonderful for overly sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this. I use it at night but also during the day if my skin could use a little hydration boost. Keeps my usually dehydrated looking skin supple with regular use. Look forward to its support over the winter months.</li>
    <li> After two weeks use have not noticed any difference to fine lines and wrinkles however will persever till jar is finished. Disappointing that all ingredients are not listed on either container or packaging and no concentrate percentage of ones that are listed. Good price though.</li>
    <li> Your skin will thank you! I have very sensitive, rash, breakout prone skin and it has helped tremedously! I used it before and went to another product; I so wish I had came back sooner. I saw almost immediate improvement!It is cheaper here than at the store (typically $29 in store) go for it.</li>
    <li> About an hour after applying creme my eyes and face had a burning sensation.  My face is red and feels like sandpaper in areas because of how bad my skin dried out.  I have used other derma e products and have never had a problem.  It has been a week and my face still hurts.</li>
    <li> derma e is fabulous! It is great on your skin and has a very low toxicity level compared to many skin care products!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for it but then again it is as good as a 15$ moisturizer can be. I would have maybe liked it better if it didn&#x27;t roll/flake off my skin 10 minutes after applying it.</li>
    <li> A French girlfriend recommended me this as it&#x27;s very good for her skin.  I decided to give it a try.  Pausing from my usual combination of La Mer eye cream then the La Mer Moisturizer, I used the La Mer eye cream then the Derma e cream on my face. I was disappointed - the cream may have got onto my eyelids overnight and my eyelids were very swelled &amp; inflamed the next morning.  Also the consistency is not as smooth as the La Mer...  I will finish the rest on my neck &amp; shoulder.</li>
    <li> All of a sudden when confronted with dry skin, where running my hands on my cheeks felt like touching a dry parchment paper, I began my search for a hydrating cream. Tried Yes to Blueberries Cream; Olay Night Moisture Mask; Olay Luminious Cream; Era Organics most popular manuka honey cream; Olay Original Moisture Cream and NOTHING would make my skin soft, hydrated and supple. I love reading reviews on Amazon and everytime, Hyaluronic Acid creams would score high so finally thought trying one myself and of going back to &#x27;Derma e&#x27; after a long time and it was like coming home to a nourishing mother who knows what&#x27;s the best for you. I was compelled to buy this from a local store at double the price but it has done what no other &#x27;hydrating&#x27; cream could do. Within two days I started waking up with an oily, shiny nose - a dream come true. I was scared that I had lost the precious skin oil forever, with nothing to replace it either. Best of all, this cream is light with the most heavenly scent that&#x27;s SO sophisticated. It&#x27;s only been 3 days and I hope to see more skin improvement like other reviewers. But stop searching for a dry skin remedy. This is it. Forget Olays, Loreals and Cliniques. Derma E&#x27;s DMAE cream is even more dramatic, received it from Amazon yesterday (in an effort to firm up my face) as my DAY-cream today my face is &amp;#34;visibly smooth&amp;#34; and the complexion much brighter! Its also light &amp; hydrating with many more benefits. I AM IMPRESSED WITH DERMA E! And equally in gratitude for Amazon&#x27;s prices.</li>
    <li> This cream did not give me the moisturization that I was looking for. I expected a lot when I read that it contains hyaluronic acid and it is called &#x27;hydrating&#x27;. It smells ok and goes on ok but it still left my skin flaky and didn&#x27;t feel very hydrated. I might try again in the summer when my skin is less needy.</li>
    <li> I have received some complements of the changing of my skin.  However,  I still don&#x27; feel I have seen the full effect of this product.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, and I use it every night before bed. I am young, but I have very dry skin, and this does the trick for me to get rid of dry, red areas. It also makes my skin very smooth. For the price, I think this product performs as well as higher end brands in providing moisture and soft skin.</li>
    <li> Not good for my skin I got the acne.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Inexpensive and effective</li>
    <li> derma e has the best product line...i use many of their products and love them all.&lt;br /&gt;great results.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s thick and very rich yet doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy once applied. I chose it beacause it doesn&#x27;t contain dimethicone or perfume. It&#x27;s a bit soon to judge its anti-aging efficacy but I think my skin looks a bit more plumped up. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Before I used pretty expensive creams, but this one is the best for the price and for the quality especially.</li>
    <li> Bought this on sale at a grocery store. It had all if the right ingredients I was looking for. Dave and I used it. We both saw great results, right away! He went on a trip, so I told him to take the Derma E with him as I had other products to use. When he came home 2 weeks later, I was shocked! He had very deep forehead wrinkles. When he came home, he virtually had none! He also lost his laugh lines. All of this in 2 weeks!! I&#x27;m back to using it again! LOL. I haven&#x27;t noticed any scent to it, and I&#x27;m really sensitive to things like that. We would highly recommend!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Once I received this product as a free sample through the mail. On the very first night I used it I could see a difference.  My skin was much firmer and smoother the very next day. I have jars and jars of face creams (a lot more expensive than derma e) that do not perform as well as this product. The fragrance itself smells delicious.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I must be on my 3rd or 4th tub now...this is a wonerful basic moisturizer. Gets done what I need it to. I have been using a thin layer (when needed) in the daytime as well. Really de-clutters my toiletry drawer. I remember when I first applied it my skin just came alive, like right after I exercise.</li>
    <li> I like the daytime a little better than this but overall still a great product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer contains good ingredients, has a nice smell and feels nice on the skin. This is a nice moisturizer for someone who does not have much skin concerns or problems.</li>
    <li> Both night and day--this cream is awesome and I can truly see results.  I was in AZ this past week and while it&#x27;s always dry there-it was particularily dry this time-many people-both men and women commented on it at the conference I was at.  This creme was the best--you could just feel your skin drinking it in.  I also have been taking the Hyaluronic Vitamins for the past 3 months and I believe the combination of using the derma e Hyalauronic Day and Night Creme and the vitamins have provided the significant improvements in my skin that I am enjoying.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This cream has been consistent with providing the intense moisturizing I need for my combination skin.  I love the way it balances out my complexion and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It is thick and has a low level scent that does not make me light-headed (yes, this has happened to me with other creams).  Thank you for making such a great product.  Keep up the good work!  Hope this is helpful.  UPDATE 1/11/2017:   DID THE FORMULA CHANGE??  This stuff is now drying the skin right off my skull!!    I used to use this regularly and loved it.  In the past month or two my skin has been looking like a cracked face goblin. WTF??</li>
    <li> Wonder cream. Will not use anything else! I am 40 and I have oily t-zone, acne prone skin. I use the night crème day and night and I love it. Got my 65 year old Mom to try it and she won&#x27;t use anything else, either!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Made my skin feel soft and actually seemed to make it fuller with some of the deep wrinkles smoothing out.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! It feels like cashmere on my skin. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again. It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my skn negatively at all (no breakouts after using).</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about three weeks now, and look 20 years younger! Ok, I&#x27;m just kidding about the 20 years younger. If you ever find a product that can do that, let me know, and I&#x27;ll invest in it.  But I digress. This Derma Hyaluronic Acid Night Creme is incredibly smooth and absorbs well into my skin. I am using a Hyaluronic serum along with this moisturizer. Apart from the actual creme absorbing and retaining moisture in my skin, it stays that way for several hours. When I awake in the morning, my skin still feels moist. It has a very mild fragrance, barely noticeable. Another reviewer mentioned to use this night creme during the day under makeup. In my opinion, I wouldn&#x27;t do that as it would more than likely leave an oily residue under your make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I used the derma roller, then the Hyaluronic Serum, then this Hyaluronic Night Creme, and it actually felt fine. I did not notice any considerable stinging. So I think this is a very good product to use alongside the derma roller.</li>
    <li> Very nice face cream, which I use at night only (I use an Estee Lauder cream during the day).  It has a pleasant, unique fragrance and was a terrific value.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought two(2) of them &amp; will be returning them.  Opened &amp; started using it, by second day my face broke out???</li>
    <li> Love everything in the Derma E line.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Used the whole jar, and didn&#x27;t notice anything amazing. It does what it is supposed to do (moisturize), and it smells fabulous!</li>
    <li> Used for many years great product</li>
    <li> I have flakey skin since menopause and this is the only lotion that works. I wear it night and day.</li>
    <li> I purchased because of dry skin on knees and elbows. Softened the skin after the first use. Dry skin gone. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> nice product it does sting a bit , i can imagine maybe a lot if you are not used to hyalruonic acid.&lt;br /&gt;Start using it only once a week, try on a  small area of your face , you will feel it tingle and sting a bit , if it is to much, put some argan oil or other moisturizer over it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good product that will make a difference to deminish fine lines etc.</li>
    <li> I am asian, 30 years old. This night cream is perfect for my skin. People still ask if I am 21.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not that crazy about the scent of the cream, it works amazingly well.  My dry patches are gone and my foundation looks so much better!  I&#x27;m 40 and hopefully not looking it yet.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT! The smell is sooo yummy!!  I put it on generously at night and when I shower in the morning, I can still feel it on my face.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love how this product feels and smells. It absorbs quickly and it makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  The bottle wasn&#x27;t tightly sealed.  Consequently, the cream was all over the inside of the lid.</li>
    <li> Works well without breaking the bank!! Simple, non-hype! I have used it for years at night, with Retin-A around my eyes. I am 55 years old, but my skin would never give me away!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Time will tell how effective it is as I have not used it long enough for good results.</li>
    <li> definitely keeps your skin hydrated, and after a few days my skin felt nice, i would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> After changing my diet and weaning myself from sugar, processed foods and animal products, my body reached new heights of environmental awareness. I realized I could no longer slather my skin with products laden with questionable chemicals. I started looking for natural alternatives and through some trial and error found this product. It works wonders for my skin (fair/combination-to-dry/sensitive). After one week of application I noticed substantial improvement. My skin is more supple now and is less prone to lines from smiles/frowns or any signs of stress. Please see the links to other Derma E products that I found particularly effective.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GF1E54 Derma e Peptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Creme, 2 oz (56 g)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0000CCW1N Derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub, 2 oz (56 g)]][[ASIN:B000V711F0 Derma e Micro-Dermabrasion Recovery Serum, 2 oz (60 ml)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GEZWPI Derma e Skin Lighten, 2 oz (56 g) (Pack of 2)]][[ASIN:B000GF1GEI Derma e Scar Gel, 2 oz (56 g) (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this night creme for a few months on top of my moisturizer (2x/day) and I love it. I have historically had combination dry/oily skin with the occasional acne flair up. In the last year, my skin has become substantially drier and this cream has completely cleared my dryness and my skin looks much healthier. The creme does not feel oily; in fact, the oily areas of my skin seem to be much less shiny since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the best night crème and I believe I have found it. This product is like the holy grail of night crèmes.  I used it for the first time last night and wow, when I woke up and looked in the mirror, my skin reversed age by ten years. I am 41 years old, and to be frank, I took my beautiful skin for granted in my youth. Between sun exposure, smoking and many lazy nights of not washing off my makeup, my skin has seen a lot of abuse. My saving grace is I look young for my age, and I also quit smoking 12 year ago and that has made a considerable difference. I also make a concerted effort to baby my face and neck and do not use products that have harmful chemicals. I subscribe to a nightly regimen of cleansing, toning and moisturizing. My daytime routine includes using Derma E Day Creme which I also love, and using a tinted BB cream that contains SPF. The hyaluronic acid plumps up the skin cells with hydration, and it really is noticeable. It has a very pleasant, but not overpowering scent. It is ph-balanced and the brand is eco-conscious: non-gmo, paraben free, no animal cruelty, gentle environmental footprint, etc. I highly recommend that you give this product a try; your skin is worth it. My face feels and looks smooth, luminous and youthful.</li>
    <li> I bought this creme plus pure hyaluronic acid, used first then the cream. Neither got rid or seemed to minimize wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;as I had been led to believe and hoped for. So I&#x27;m ready to give up</li>
    <li> I love this cream! It has a great smell and my face looks and feels amazing after using this cream. I have tried many of the Derma E products and this is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Love all dermae products, use them faithfully</li>
    <li> It definetly works on wrinkles and I do wake up looking hydrated. Although, I don&#x27;t believe the results last. I&#x27;ve still been getting dry on my face. I use it every night and I do reccomend but don&#x27;t expect a crazy good product. I definetly bought this product because of the hype, it does&#x27;nt exactly live up to it&#x27;s expectations.</li>
    <li> This crème just seems to feed my skin. It feels great, I can&#x27;t imagine not using it. It is not greasy, it just seems to hydrate my skin. It makes my skin so soft. I love this product and highly recommend it. I have used creams consistently since I have been in high school and that is over 40 years. This is by far the most reasonably priced and the best quality. I even use it in the morning too!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price. Best product I have found for my dry skin so far.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I do like this product.  I apply it a night and in the morning my face does feel smoother and moist and the product is not greasy.  However, I had hoped that it would minimize the small wrinkles around my mouth, smile lines, I really don&#x27;t notice a difference so that has been disappointing but I would buy the product again due to it&#x27;s ability to add much needed moisture.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing for maturing skin. But I like L&#x27;Oreal for mature skin better&lt;br /&gt;as my skin is very, very  dry.</li>
    <li> This whole line has been nothing but pure pleasure and the results are the same!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need much, softens my skin well, doesn&#x27;t make me itch, has a nice smell. Glad to finally find products that help!</li>
    <li> I used it n one side of my face and asked my Estetician if she could tell a difference in the depth of the  wrinkles on  my face. She saw a considerable difference in the depth of the wrinkles on the side with the hyaluronic acid. So........it works!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. It&#x27;s light weight so it doesn&#x27;t cause me to perspire during the night. I do feel its doing a good job keeping my skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> I use this at night and I&#x27;ve begun to use it as an eye cream during the day since it is so rich and creamy.  I finish my makeup and then dab a real tiny little bit under the eyes towards the outer corners.  (Not an area where I use powder anyway).  Great smell and very hydrating!</li>
    <li> This cream is a must for me before anything else goes on my face. Truly alleviates the dry tight feeling that my mature, wrinkled skin gets after washing or in the cold and dry conditions of winter. Makes my face happy.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Have always liked the feel and fragrance of this product. Use it for night moisturizing after cleansing and go to bed feeling fresh and  pampered.  I also use this for daytime when the weather is particularly dry.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feels sooooo good at night.</li>
    <li> Nice and hydrating and gluten free!</li>
    <li> Great nighttime moisturizer and skin refresher!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this cream but it smells like a really bad Glade plugin. Perhaps you are into that? Not I. Plus I seemed to break out after using. Will return to my tried and true Jason Vit. C cream.</li>
    <li> Like this alot but switched to products with healthier ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Not sure how I came across the Derma e brand but am so glad I did. I know have a counter full of the stuff! Night cream, day cream, eye cream, scrub...etc. My face is sensitive and prone to breaking out easily so I am hesitant in using new face products..but I am sold on this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This night cream is thick enough but soaks into my skin nicely, it does not seem to cause breakouts, and has a decent odor. The price is great and the jar is relatively big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order again as soon as I need to.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this cream on my skin.  Smells good too, very light.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Although this is called a &amp;#34;night creme&amp;#34;, it looks wonderful on middle aged skin undermake up.  People complemented me on my foundation (which I wear ever day), but the difference was actually this cream underneath which made my base look fresh and glowing.  In my opinion, this cream is better than any Olay product I&#x27;ve ever used and at a better price.</li>
    <li> I suffer from very dry/sensative skin. This cream is perfect! The smell is divine and makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> excellent moisturizing cream.  face feels great in the morning.</li>
    <li> Just received this cream 2 days ago. So far I like it..  This cream also feels very nice.. Not heavy ,no odor.. I am using it today for a day cream before I put on my makeup.. I personally do not believe that any cream can get rid of wrinkles, remains to be seem..</li>
    <li> This stuff works miracles. I love all of the products from Derma E. If you have acne try the skinbotics. Clears it right up. I have about 5 of the products made by Derma e and rave about all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe in favorietes...but this is a good product...would recomend for ppl who like to  switch it up !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product..no effect to me.i hope I can get my refund. no changes in my skin..  sorry but that&#x27;s the thruth</li>
    <li> This cream made me break out.  Bad.  I was disappointed. I love the eye cream from Derma e,  unfortunately, this face cream will be used up on my feet..,,</li>
    <li> I have been using derma e face care products for several years. I especially like the fact that they are natural and Eco friendly. In researching skin care for &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin I have found the recommended key ingredients in derma e products. They have never caused any negative reactions on my skin. The night cream gives enough hydration and last a long time( it actually lasted me about a year--- I wrote the date I started using it on the bottom of the jar)</li>
    <li> Great product. I love this stuff........ Everything was perfect with this transaction. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is my 4th jar of this cream….love it.  I use it as my day moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Nice night cream. Not greasy which is important to me. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Feels good when you put it on, but skin does not stay moist.  Also left my skin somewhat irritated.  If you are looking for a vegan / cruelty free moisturizer good for sensitive skin I recommend Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish Oil-Free Antioxidant Facial Moisturizer, which is what I use now.</li>
    <li> I hope they never stop making this cream. I use it day and night, for the past 4 years, and the scent is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was walking through the fragrance and beauty department.  One of the high end cosmetic companies was offering a mini-spa-moment -- analyze your skin, suggest products, free make over.  They thought my skin looked good and asked what I use.  When I told them that a use a hyaluronic acid product (the same ingredient that they use in their product line), they wanted to know where I got it.  And when I told them how much it costs, they called in all the ladies that work at the counter.  They wrote down everything I told them. I hope they followed through. I have been using dermae hyaluronic cremes for several years now.  And, love the results.  P.S., I am 60 years old.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  It does have a scent, which I don&#x27;t mind.  I have sensitive skin and also acne prone but this lotion works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it was just excellent as all products from e-derma&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Very cheap, but the use effect</li>
    <li> 62 yr old. Tries so many face cremes. Save your money and time, this is the best, absorbs quckly, non-greasy, and the moist effect lasts after the creme disappears. Use it AM and PM. Magic.</li>
    <li> I used thios product twice and then stuck it in the back of my cabinet.  It is so heavy and greasy!!! My skin broke out immediately and that NEVER happens!</li>
