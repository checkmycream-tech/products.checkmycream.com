      <li>It works great on naturally curly hair that is prone to dryness.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated; it doesn&#x27;t require a lot to get good coverage.  </li>

      <li>My hair looks flawless more shiny and less frizzy.</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of other conditioners and this one works the best for my frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>I received this order in a VERY TIMELY fashion and it was packaged nice and securely--</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think that this is a genuine Moroccan Oil product.  </li>
      <li>I use this conditioner for 2 years and no problem and my whole family use I like how my hair are nice after</li>
      <li>It just didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft, and it didn&#x27;t smell as good.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t as potent as the ones on the shelves at a store and when you put it in your hair the real conditioner is more of an oil that isn&#x27;t visible.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair feeling silky smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>even though i dont use it daily(i use it about 2x a week), my hair is already in better condition, i can tell by the feel of it and my stylist said i have less split ends and was happy i started using it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>Does not have the same strong smell as the same product I buy at the salon, but still an excellent product!</li>
      <li>We all love the smell and we have soft tangle free hair.</li>

    <li> Although it makes your hair look less frizzy and more soft this is a fake. The smell isn&#x27;t as potent as the ones on the shelves at a store and when you put it in your hair the real conditioner is more of an oil that isn&#x27;t visible. This one is.</li>
    <li> the Moroccanoil shampoo repair and conditioner are amazing.both my daughter and i wanted to try them because it smells so wonderful when they use it at charles penzones hair salon. It leaves your hair smelling so good all day. now, my daughter and I both use the shampoo and conditioner, i cant use them on a daily basis because i have a sensitive scalp that will break out from time to time when using a rich product. even though i dont use it daily(i use it about 2x a week), my hair is already in better condition, i can tell by the feel of it and my stylist said i have less split ends and was happy i started using it. my daughter uses the oil during the week while she is away at college and the shampoo and conditioner when she is  home.(she has never had a problem with it).  i love the way it makes my hair smell.and it lasts all day. sometimes i dont even wear perfume haha. anyway, the product is a bit pricey so i only use it when i have a date another special occasion. I also opted for the bigger bottles because that&#x27;s how you get the most for your money. and because of the pump provided i can just refill the smaller bottles when they need it.  i just hope i can always purchase it on amazon for such a great price!!!</li>
    <li> Love! Love! Love!  One of the best hair product lines I&#x27;ve ever used - and I&#x27;ve used a lot.  I have pretty course hair, so I need a good shampoo and conditioner combo.  It&#x27;s very concentrated; it doesn&#x27;t require a lot to get good coverage.  So, even though this is rather an expensive single purchase, it will last a long time. I think it&#x27;s a good value. And the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as I love the Moroccan Oil products. But I noted a difference in the products that is &amp;#34;Made in Israel&amp;#34; and products NOT made in Israel. This particular product is NOT made in Israel and has different ingredients. I prefer the products made in Israel for superior performance.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner for not only myself but my young girls.  My girls do not like to have their hair combed after a shower (or anytime if it is going to hurt)and many times when i use enough product in their hair so it doesn&#x27;t hurt their hair looks greasy.  This conditioner has solved our combing crys.  We all love the smell and we have soft tangle free hair.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil products are the best. Makes my hair few healthy and shiny. You will love this product.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil conditioner is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and my hair is really healthy and strong now.  I do color treat my hair, so it has a tendency to be brittle and dry, but not so while using this product, along with the shampoo by MoroccanOil.</li>
    <li> This is amazing I use it with the shampoo. My hair looks flawless more shiny and less frizzy. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if what I received is the &#x27;real&#x27; product by MoroccanOil or if it&#x27;s fake and in a duplicated bottle, however, it still makes my hair look great, so does it matter?  It was for a good price (which is why it seems too good to be true) and it works.  The bottle said, \\&quot;Not for resale\\&quot; so I don&#x27;t know if it may be a diverted product from MoroccanOil.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used.  So happy I tried it. My hair never felt and looked so healthy.</li>
    <li> I was just recently introduced to MoroccanOil off the shelf at the salon. I didn&#x27;t buy it but I saw it sitting there and it looked unfamiliar, certainly never heard of it but the girls at the salon were bragging about what a great product it was. I ordered the Moisture Repair Shampoo and Conditioner off Amazon. It was a pretty penny but I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about it so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and so far I think it is definitely worth the price. It smells really good, almost like a fragrance for your hair. I love it. My hair feels really soft and looks clean and shimmery. I have a few favorite shampoo and conditioner sets but this one is definitely my number one favorite.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Moroccanoil products. They have had the best affects on my hair and it works on any hair types. I recieved it in a good amount of time. I didnt have to wait very long.</li>
    <li> I started with the oil and loved it so much from my hairdresser I came online to get the ECONO sized shampoo and conditioner.  Love the pump!  The smell is so exotic.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Love all the Morrocan Oil products. I received this order in a VERY TIMELY fashion and it was packaged nice and securely--no leakage whatsoever. Also a GREAT price comparatively speaking.</li>
    <li> We really like this product; probably more because it smells so good than anything else. We&#x27;ve been using for more than a year (got first few bottles at a salon) and like it enough to keep purchasing it. but honestly not sure it does anything more for our hair than drug store brands.</li>
    <li> Amazing product at a great price</li>
    <li> My number one conditioner. This brand makes amazing hair products. They smell great and do wonders to your hair. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccan hair oil conditioner. This is my second time ordering this product, however, I noticed there was a definite difference in quality with my second purchase. It just didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft, and it didn&#x27;t smell as good. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was different because the bottle looked exactly the same. Finally, I noticed that the conditioner I received was for &amp;#34;all hair types&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;dry and damaged hair.&amp;#34;  I just returned the conditioner and amazon is sending me another product. Please check your label before opening. This is the reason for my three star rating.</li>
    <li> have not had a chance to use product as of yet;but it smells really good and I can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> yes, it says on the bottle not for resale and it is a bit strange,  but the fact that makes my hair soft as silk makes me not really care. I will keep buying, for  sure.</li>
    <li> This Moisture Repair shampoo and conditioner is the best product out there.  It leaves your hair feeling silky smooth and clean.  It smells amazing and feels even better. I have tried every high end and low end shampoo out there and this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> The best product ever. Thanks for many great hair days. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it! Looking forward to a great summer with great hair...</li>
    <li> This conditioner is nice and heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
    <li> This was highly recommended by a beauty advisor who I subscribe to on YouTube.  I initially balked at the price; however, she raved so much about it, I ordered it, since she&#x27;s given good advice previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this conditioner very much, and while I do think that it conditions my past-shouldler-length hair quite well, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m able to justify the price.  Following towel-drying my hair, I do add a quality hair oil which I believe adds most of the shine that follows.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll re-purchase this product again, as there are many really great products out there that cost half this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I like it?  Yes!  It&#x27;s unfortunate it costs as much as it does.</li>
    <li> I Just start using this product over a week.  I have a Good feeling it&#x27;s a Good product.  My hair is so soft, shining and no more frizzy. I have got tons of compliments from coworkers about my hair.  I recommended them to buy this product.  Hope this product will Keep doing Good on my hair.  So far I like it.  Forgot to mention, I also purchased the Hydration mask.  I use it once a week.  That product is awesome.  Worth every penny.  It save me more money to have my hair treatment done in salon.  They basically use the same product but charge us An arm and as leg.  So Good bye Salon.</li>
    <li> Great size!  Has a pump, and has been great for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> This large bottle of conditioner goes a long way! You don&#x27;t have to use as much conditioner as you normally would. One bottle lasts me about 3 months. I have very long, thick hair. I condition everyday &amp; shampoo every other day. I airways grow my hair out until it&#x27;s to my waist then chop it off &amp; donate it to Wigs4kids. For this reason I do not dye or process my hair. This is the perfect product to assure those kids get the perfect hair!</li>
    <li> I love the &#x27;Moisture Repair&#x27; version of Moroccan oil.  I have processed hair and its much nicer and gentle than&lt;br /&gt;the Clarifying version.  I also get lots of compliments that my hair smells so good! A great buy.</li>
    <li> I live in Vermont and during the winter my hair can dry out from all the dry heat indoors.  I have short hair and need to wash it almost daily and this conditioner keeps it shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It helped repair my dry hair. It has a great smell that I love. I purchased the large bottle from Amazon and it arrived within a day! I was amazed!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair...I color my hair and just love the sun...this equals dry parched hair.&lt;br /&gt;Morocconoil Conditioner is the best nutrition for my hair!</li>
    <li> I would love to be able to rate the product however the seller sent me shampoo instead of conditioner. I had to spend 30 min on the phone with Amazon to get it straightened out!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else. Keeps my over-processed locks looking good. Great smell. Cheaper than buying from the salon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I have tried a lot of other conditioners and this one works the best for my frizzy hair.  It makes my hair so soft and easy to style.</li>
    <li> Love it and the price here makes it even better.</li>
    <li> I love this product , especially the scent.  But I gave it only 3 stars because when I received the box, the bottle had opened and spilled some of the product all over the inside of the box.  Now I have a great smelling shipping box, but less conditioner that I paid for :(</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner...it leaves my hair manageable.  Highly recommend with Shampoo and oil for a more smooth and soft touch to your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner because it really moisturizes my hair like no other conditioner. It works great on naturally curly hair that is prone to dryness. It also smell great. I will continue buying this product. I also use Kerastase products.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner ever and a lot cheaper than you can find in stores. I saw it in stores at $150 the same size</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and will never use another one. It&#x27;s great for moisture on African American hair. My hair feels so silky after I use it</li>
    <li> Loved both the products, leaves your hair feeling great! Would recommend these items to all if you have dry hair.  Just a few shampoos and you notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I tried the volume style of Morrocan Oil and loved the smell. I was walking in a gallery when the gallery guard stopped me to ask me what perfume I was wearing but it was my hair. I guess the bad point is that it smells strongly. I then purchased the moisture repair and it was not the same end result as the volume. Moisture control didn&#x27;t leave it as smooth feeling and (obviously) less bouncy.</li>
    <li> Love this!! I use it every other day and it instantaneously moisturizes my hair. i am buying again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great IF you buy it from a reputable dealer. I bought this one and it had to be fake or something. It was horrible and wrecked my hair. Makes me think I bought a ripoff.... No wonder if was so inexpensive!</li>
    <li> The product does not seem to be actual moroccan oil conditioner it does not smell like the one I purchased in stores and it does not work as well as the one I had before</li>
    <li> Love it! This is my new favorite conditioner. My hair is noticeably more smooth after use. It de tangles my curly hair with ease and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> The value, size and product are the best!  I usually buy this in the salons, but I gained 3 times the product for less the cost.</li>
    <li> The pump was destroyed when the product arrived &amp; the conditioner was leaking. Didn&#x27;t loose a whole lot of it, but its expensive enough to make a difference.</li>
    <li> Does not have the same strong smell as the same product I buy at the salon, but still an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Probably the best conditioner Ive ever used on my hair. Im always happy with their products, no wonder salons always use Morrocan Oil.</li>
    <li> I have had several Brazilian Blow out treatments along with coloring my hair and this product is wonderful for treated hair; especially when used in coordination with the Moroccan Oil moisture renewal shampoo.  It makes my hair so soft and makes the treatment and color last longer than anything I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Hair is not frizzy, scalp doesn&#x27;t itch.  Only shampoo/conditioner I use and I&#x27;ve been using 3 years now. Worth the price in my book.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but I&#x27;m pleased with the results this far. I&#x27;m using this product in conjunction with a Redkin product called One United that I got at Ulta. Between the two products my hair looks and feels healthy even though it gets bleached once every 4-6 weeks. Product arrived quickly and was packaged very well.</li>
    <li> Delivered and works as described.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that this is a genuine Moroccan Oil product.  Beware.</li>
    <li> My hair couldn&#x27;t be softer, only downside is that I have to wash my hair more often because it gets oily quicker.. oohh but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner for 2 years and no problem and my whole family use I like how my hair are nice after</li>
    <li> Excellent product - I buy the product every year for my three girls, all in their thirties.  I always buy the large size and it usually lasts from one Christmas to the next.  I sometimes ask if they want to try something new, but they never do.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes my hair so soft and silky. Everyone who gets close to me comments on how good my hair smells! Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> It was as advertised and arrived on time.</li>
