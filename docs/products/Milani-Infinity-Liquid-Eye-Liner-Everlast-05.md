      <li>If I found it, I&#x27;d have to buy two if there was more than one.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll gladly buy it again.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It also smudged more than I thought it would.</li>
      <li>in all, it&#x27;s much better than my ELF (what isn&#x27;t?)</li>
      <li>/&gt;PRODUCT IS GREAT, DEF VERY WATERPROOF.</li>
      <li>but this is my favorite liner.</li>
      <li>The reason I&#x27;m writing a review here is because I got it for a better deal here than I do at the drug store.</li>
      <li>- I love</li>

      <li>I love finding an eyeliner that stays put.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this eyeliner is the best ever</li>
      <li>You get a nice precise line that wears all day with this liner.</li>

      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>I really love this eye liner.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>put!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am routinely the only one in the swimming pool or at the beach whose eyes are still perfectly lined.</li>
      <li>But when you want to finally take it off just use a bit of Vaseline :D</li>

      <li>I was sooo excited when I found it online :-)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to apply!</li>
      <li>used a q-tip dipped in LouAnna coconut cooking oil and it came off extremely easily.  </li>
      <li>so well to be EASY to get off?</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t come off without eye makeup remover which I love and then comes clean off.</li>
      <li>Thw liquid eyeliner is fine</li>
      <li>Its been really hot and humid outside, so i needed the perfect eyeliner.</li>
      <li>You could go to bed and wake up with it still looking fabulous.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for those occasional \\&quot;sleepovers\\&quot; -</li>
      <li>I hope they will try to make their product, especially this one that seems to be so popular, more available to people at a better price.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>So if you make a mistake, clean immediately with a q-tip before it dries, or some baby oil.  </li>
      <li>MAC Liquidlast has been a hassle to get a hold of lately, and this is THE perfect dupe.  </li>
      <li>Quick to arrive.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s water proof (which is great for self contious girls swimming around other people) Keep on keeping on!</li>
      <li>Wow! :)</li>
      <li>Great pigmentation, brush is easy to work with, however, I found the formula to be quite thick and &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s great for nights at the club when you&#x27;re getting a little sweaty from all the dancing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have SUPER oily eyes under my eyes and in the outside corners.For years and years I have  struggled to find a waterproof eyeliner that would work without leaving me with eventual melting, especially at the corners while I work and can&#x27;t touch it up. I also line the inside of my eyes and needed something that would last without flaking and coming off into the corners of my eyes. This is the ONLY one I have found that worked. I tried so many brands including Sephora and other very expensive brands, Maybelline (which flaked HORRIBLY inside my eyes), and others that simply melted. I tried eye primers of all kinds too in order to stop the melty. This stays on, it works and as long as I put it just a teeny bit away from the corners of my lower lids, I get NO melting. I have been using this for years. The only time I have ever had a problem is when I can&#x27;t find it. There are two Walgreen&#x27;s literally only a mile apart from each other right by my home. Only one would carry the Milani line and they were always out of this. If I found it, I&#x27;d have to buy two if there was more than one. Milani doesn&#x27;t sell them in enough stores. I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t use Walmart either. I like their eyeshadows and blush but they are way too expensive through Milani itself. Even on Amazon.com the eyeliner is a bit too expensive compared to Walgreen&#x27;s. For now, I have to buy it here and pay the higher price when I can&#x27;t find it when it shows up at the Walgreen&#x27;s. I hope they will try to make their product, especially this one that seems to be so popular, more available to people at a better price.</li>
    <li> Love this liquid eyeliner - it stays on pretty much all day long and it&#x27;s super easy to apply! I searched everywhere and spent a lot of money looking for an eyeliner that wouldn&#x27;t run down my face or wear off by mid day- this one stays in place for as long as you want it to. You will never have to worry about touching up your eyeliner ever again- just make sure you have a good make up remover-</li>
    <li> My favorite liquid liner! Easy to apply, stays all day!! I&#x27;ve tried other brands and was always disappointed. I&#x27;m sticking with this one!</li>
    <li> I tried using this eyeliner once and tossed in the garbage can.  It was very gooey with little clumps and difficult to control the amount of product.  You get what you pay for.  I&#x27;m going back to my normal cream eyeliner and separate brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an eyeliner junkie and I haven&#x27;t found many liquid eyeliners that are ACTUALLY water proof and smudge proof until this product. It is great for an all day look when you cant touch up. I start my day at 7:45am and by 5pm it still looks like I just applied it. The brush is really easy to use, whether you want to make thin or thick cat eyes. I recommend using an oil based make up remover to take it off, it really does last that long.</li>
    <li> Best I have found so far for staying power. I am old, my eyes water a lot. My eyelids are oily.  This stayed put. Louisiana is a hot, sweaty, humid state. This liner did not go away.&lt;br /&gt;I did cut half the bristles off the brush and angle cut the remainder. I am old and don&#x27;t like heavy eye makeup. It is a bit clumpy, but with the thinner brush and wiping it against the container  it went on much better.&lt;br /&gt;I used a q-tip dipped in LouAnna coconut cooking oil and it came off extremely easily.  No muss no fuss.</li>
    <li> This stuff really stays on once you put it on.  I use it in my waterline.  Just be careful to let it dry before letting go of your lid or it ends up on your eye and is not easy to get off.  It does stay put all day and night until you take it off! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a watery eye so I use this in the inner corner of my eye almost to the middle and a different liner that is easier for me to work with to shape the rest of the eye. This liner really stays on even with my wet eye.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I picked this up without knowing how well it would work. I have fair oily skin/eyelids and this lasts all day for me, even when I accidently forget to wash it off, I will wake up and it still hasn&#x27;t smudged. This lasts me throughout a 8 he shift! And that alone is amazing!  The only negative to it is the brush. It holds waaaaaaay toooo much of the product. I always use another brush (angled brow brush) to wing it out.  OH! It&#x27;s a dramatic, intense color. I love that!</li>
    <li> I LOVED my last Milani Infinity Liquid Eye Liner - but this one was listed dark brown (which was the one I had purchased at  locally) but when I put it on it was VERY dark.  I would call it black rather than Brown!!  Other than the color difference - I love Miliani Infinity eyeliner - no flakes - no mess!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Stays on forever.  Never runs. I&#x27;ll never use another eyeliner again!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I bought it because I wanted something that would stay on, and this did not disapoint.It  lasts a very long time. It&#x27;s hard to get off unless you&#x27;re using a makeup remover, but would you really expect a liner that stays on so well to be EASY to get off?</li>
    <li> Lasts all day. Very dark black like I was looking for. The applicator is a brush and it sucks applying it. I end up getting clumps on my lashes. You need an oil based makeup remover to remove it since it stays on ALL day.</li>
    <li> If you have oily or droopy eyelids this is a perfect liner. It stays put until you take it off.You&#x27;ll need an oil based remover but if you don&#x27;t put it on too heavy,olive oil will work.Wish I could get it in charcoal. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. The fine brush allows thin or thick application and it stays on all day.  I had given up on eyeliner due to allergies that caused tearing.  This product stays on through the tears, and even lasts overnight.  I have been using it for almost a year and I love it.</li>
    <li> If you have heavy eyelids that often rub off eyeliner this is a good product. I took off two stars because the brush it comes with is thick and difficult to control. The eyeliner liquid itself is like glue and doesn&#x27;t come off from a day of wear. With the brush I found it hard to get a clean consistent line, so I would layer over the rough edge with another eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff.  I&#x27;ve a drawer full of eyeliners of various price points and this is the only one I use.  It is very dark.  I find the brush easy to use, to make a thick or thin line.  I usually just do a thin line along the lash line.  This stuff lasts all day.  Absolutely waterproof. So if you make a mistake, clean immediately with a q-tip before it dries, or some baby oil.  To remove I dip a q-tip in baby oil and wipe off.  I&#x27;ve not found any other way to remove this as effectively.  I used to purchase from Target but they no longer carry, not I&#x27;ve got to order online.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on all of the excellent reviews, but I have found it cakes and balls up before the end of the day. I do apply it to the inside of the lashes though where maybe it picks up too much moister.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite eye liners.  It stays on all day.  I use baby oil to take it off.  I love it and the color is perfect.</li>
    <li> Thw liquid eyeliner is fine but I needed a bigger brush. The one provided is too fine and stiff for me.</li>
    <li> This goes on very smooth, lasts all day (or more than one day), &amp; has perfect control for &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; look! The only annoying thing is that because it has so much sticking power - if you make a mistake its ON there lol! I always keep baby oil &amp; a Q-tip on hand while applying it in case I need to remove any of it!</li>
    <li> My sister is happy with them.  Keep stocking them.</li>
    <li> Milani eyeliner is the ONLY eyeliner I trust to not smear and make me look like a panda. I love, love, love this eyeliner! It is easy to apply, stays on all day (even the next day), and comes off like a charm with eye makeup remover. I&#x27;m now a die hard fan!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t flake or peel&lt;br /&gt;long lasting - wore for a night out of dancing &amp; it didn&#x27;t sweat off&lt;br /&gt;no smudges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would suggest you remove with eye makeup remover!</li>
    <li> Sadly, I have eyes that constantly water, which has always led to raccoon eyes with almost any eyeliner. Of the many, many liners I&#x27;ve tried (seriously, I&#x27;ve tried about 30; liquids, pencils, crayons, gels, creams...you name it), this has the best staying power. I would write a long, detailed review about it (because there are a few other great things to mention), but for people like me with very sensitive eyes, staying power (without smearing, transferring, or causing a bad reaction) matters the most. However, I&#x27;m not a fan of the brush. Instead, I use a gel liner brush with it. This liner does not budge at all, and it&#x27;s also sold in drugstores. I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for summer time when you&#x27;re out all day sweating and swimming around. It&#x27;s indestructable! But when you want to finally take it off just use a bit of Vaseline :D</li>
    <li> This is the only liquid eye liner that I have found that actually stays on for any length of time as I have allergy eyes  and wanted a liquid liner that wouldn&#x27;t come off constantly</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is awesome.  MAC Liquidlast has been a hassle to get a hold of lately, and this is THE perfect dupe.  Great stuff, for a fraction of the price.  The brush is on the thick side in comparison to MAC Liquidlast&#x27;s, but the formula itself quite the carbon copy.  Great stuff!  Glad I read the Temptalia review ([...] and went out to get it.  I will be using this from now.</li>
    <li> One of my friend recommended me this eyeliner! And I have to say it works great! It doesn&#x27;t smudge and last supper long time!! Even you had oil skin/eye lids!! The price is fair, too! But it might be a good choose for beginner, cuz the brush tip is not very pointy ...... Otherwise! I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for 4 years! I absolutely love it! The reason I&#x27;m writing a review here is because I got it for a better deal here than I do at the drug store. I can do a makeup haul here and spend less money than I do at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for those who need a good, long-lasting eyeliner, this is the one for you! I can&#x27;t tell you how many &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; pencil liners I&#x27;ve tried and they all faded by the end of the day. This one doesn&#x27;t. The only thing that could possibly make it fade is chlorinated pool water or kisses from your SO. ;)</li>
    <li> Simply said, i have tried what i feel like is every liquid eyeliner in drug stores.. and i find this to be the BEST. I have oily skin so getting eyeliners to not smudge, fade, or come apart is always a challenge.. but this will stay on for ever unless i physically take it off! I showered with it on and it still looked perfect after! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT to wear in the water/beach. No running, but it is hard to fix if you mess up putting it on, so don&#x27;t screw up! It is pretty difficult to get off. You WILL need a good eye make up remover or you&#x27;ll take off lashes trying to get the bits off.</li>
    <li> I dont write very many reviews but when I do it is because a product is extremely good or really bad. Looking at the five stars you probably know which one of the above it is for this product. The only 2 things that are a part of my makeup is eyeliner (on the water-line) and a little bit of blush. I try almost every eyeliner that comes in the market. Earlier last year one of my friends showed me the MAC Liquidlast liner priced at $22 before tax. As much as I agree that it is a lot of money, I could not get to find another brand that even comes close to MAC. [[ASIN:B0018HNEA2 MAC Liquidlast Liner POINT BLACK]]&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have spent on about 4 bottles of that alone and in the mean time I have spent on several brands of eyeliners ranging from $2 to $18 from Target, Walmart, Sephora etc.&lt;br /&gt;Just like one of those buys, I bought this one at the local drugstore and I am in love with it. I looked at the product and immediately checked the review on amazon (which is where I always go) and found that the other 4 people have given it over 4 stars. Whenever I see this, I say to myself that these reviews have got to be fake. But for what it is worth, I purchased this one for around $7 and I am awestruck. It is truly 24 hours. I have a terrible cold and sinus at this point. So this is the best test for me with watery eyes and constant sneezing. If an eyeliner can withstand this, it can certainly withstand anything. Do not hesitate to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is byfar the best liner I have ever had. I hope the company continues to make this and hopefully amazon can add it to its amazon PRIME products.</li>
    <li> It was on time and what I expected, but the packaging was slightly damaged. I don&#x27;t really mind, it still does its job!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite eyeliner. i have been using it for 3 years. lasts all day (even after i&#x27;m done doing laps at the pool or after a beach day) and when it does come off, it peels instead of smudging. so you don&#x27;t really need makeup remover to get it off. a simple hydrating cream and a Q tip would do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m by no means a pro at make up but this is my favorite liner. It stays on incredibly well and with a steady hand (or in my case some make up remover and q-tips) can make neat line and can be adjusted well. The bush tip is a bit hard to work with at first but after a little practice it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest people give this a try.</li>
    <li> Does not flake or smear! Been using it for over ten years. Love it</li>
    <li> I like this product very much---as it is waterproof. One can swim and take a shower and it does not run nor smear. The only problem is that it thickens very quickly; thus, it does not apply as smooth as when first purchased. It is still the best on the market!  :)</li>
    <li> It was a lil  sticky and kind dry.</li>
    <li> The best eyeliner I&#x27;ve every tried. Stays through all day even on my oily lids. Completely waterproof. Nice jet black color and fine black brush wand. Won&#x27;t come off without eye makeup remover which I love and then comes clean off. If you accidentally sleep in it, it&#x27;ll be mostly there for a lived in look the next day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used liquid eyeliner practically all my life . I&#x27;ve tried everything from the inexpensive brands to the higher end purchased in sephora. I&#x27;m very impressed with this brand.  It goes on matte. It holds all day for me from 8 to 8.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not waterproof though . It will run when wet but it holds up through tears.&lt;br /&gt;The tip is very fine which makes it good for a precise line. The only downfall is that it seems to run out quickly approx 4 weeks</li>
    <li> I cannot und this eyeliner in my town... I was sooo excited when I found it online :-) it works Fantasic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve. Been using. This  awesome. Waterproof  liquid. Eyeliner for a couple. Years now, &amp; I will NOT. USE ANYTHING  ELSE!&#x27; I USED SO MANY OTHERS IN THE PAST THAT LIED ABOUT THEIR. EYELINER. BEING. WATERPROOF, AMONG OTHER THINGS &amp; BOY THAT WAS RIDICULOUS  WHEN I STARTED GETTING. RACCOON  EYES,&amp; LOOKED STUPID!! THIS AMAZING EYELINER ,FOR ME,DOESNT BUDGE, RUN NOR SMEAR LIKE THOSE OTHER FAKE WATERPROOF. ONES!&#x27; IT ACTS LIKE A TATTOO ON  MY EYE, TIL THE NEXT DAY!!&#x27;  AFTER BEING MISLEAD BY OTHER WATERPROOF. EYELINERS, THIS ONE HAS PROVEN  TO BE THE CHAMPION OF ALL  WATERPROOF.  EYELINERS!!!  SECOND TO NONE!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I should not have &amp;#34;listened&amp;#34; to the reviews in this case, because I either got an old product or the applicator is supposed to be stiff to where you have to do multiple strokes just to get a thin line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most positive (yet also frustrating) thing is it is really long-lasting and can hold up to a lot. It&#x27;s frustrating because if you think you&#x27;re going to get it off with soap and water, then you&#x27;d better be prepared to have some very sore eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an eyeliner that I&#x27;ve literally used for years (bad, I know) that&#x27;s only now starting to clump up, but I may have to use it for a while longer until I get get a more suitable replacement, or just that same eyeliner again. 2 stars means &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it,&amp;#34; and that it is definitely the case here.</li>
    <li> I really love this eye liner. It does not come off until you take it off yourself. I tell everyone about and I even demo it not coming off by rubbing my eyes really hard no smudging or streaks. I just love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is no joke! When I received it in the mail I applied a swatch to my hand and immediately noticed how intense the color was. Well let me tell you after scrubbing, showering, washing with soap and scrubbing a little more the liner was still on my hand and had not budged at all... I couldn&#x27;t believe it. After the swatch test I decided to give it a go and applied the cat eye that I wear daily. Great pigmentation, brush is easy to work with, however, I found the formula to be quite thick and &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;. The thickness of the product provided an opaque black line but waiting for it to dry was a bit of a pain. Overall I would say its a great product to use for special events when you need your makeup to last but I personally would not wear it everyday due to the drying time and removal process (had to soak a cotton round in makeup remover and apply for a good two minute before all of the product was removed).</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS FOR VACATION! MONTHS AGO! STILL HAVE YET TO RECIEVED THIS! I WILL NEVER ORDER BACK. AND I WOULD PROBABLY GIVE THIS 0 IF I COULD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT IS GREAT, DEF VERY WATERPROOF. DOES NOT COME OFF IN THE POOL OR SHOWER....IF YOURE TEARY EYED. JUST GET IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see what the hype is with this stuff. I didn&#x27;t find it to have a very good waterproof hold to it. It was a bit flaky, and it took forever to dry. It also smudged more than I thought it would. It&#x27;s still good stuff and hopefully will hold up on my day to hershey. I&#x27;ll let you guys know. Anyway, I just don&#x27;t see what the hype was about.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with milani. It&#x27;s one brand I swear by. I&#x27;ve been using this liner for years! Everyone always asks me how I get my car eye so perfect.... And milani is my answer. It&#x27;s the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had over the years that actually is AT LEAST 24 hours. I can run my eyes and this stuff won&#x27;t move, smudge, or mess up. Plus it&#x27;s water proof (which is great for self contious girls swimming around other people) Keep on keeping on!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give it four stars because while it stays ALL DAY, it looks dried out upon application? It&#x27;s not bad by any means but a slight bit crackly. I would hope for it to nicely apply and dry rather than looking &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;. It did stay on ALL day but UNLIKE other reviewers, mine comes off pretty easy. I haven&#x27;t tried it at the pool YET but with coconut oil and a baby wipe, it comes off fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s much better than my ELF (what isn&#x27;t?) and I&#x27;ll gladly buy it again. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so crackly looking.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and long lasting - what more do you need?! I also have had reactions from other eye make-up, but that is not the case with the Milani Infinity Liquid Eye liner.</li>
    <li> I love finding an eyeliner that stays put.  This is one of those eyeliners that does not move for a good 24 hours.  You could go to bed and wake up with it still looking fabulous.  Unfortunately, it is really thick and goopy.  I go through a ton of Qtips trying to get it to stay where it needs to be.  Once it dries, it is awesome.  I did buy a second bottle thinking I may have gotten a bad one, but the second was just as thick.  I do still use it, especially if I am wanting something that I need to last for a longer than normal amount of time.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this brand at target, but they discontinued this type. You get a nice precise line that wears all day with this liner.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Quick to arrive.</li>
    <li> LOVE this liner. I have really oily skin so it&#x27;s always really difficult to find a liquid eyeliner that will actually stay on throughout the day. Milani&#x27;s liner goes on smooth and stays put even when it&#x27;s beyond hot and humid outside. I use cold cream to remove, so it comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator brush can be a little difficult to use, especially if you like to create very thin lines with your eyeliner. I prefer thicker strokes, so this isn&#x27;t a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and don&#x27;t plan on going back!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used. I hope they never discontinue it. It stays on even when wet.</li>
    <li> As everyone else says, this stuff stays on! This is the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t come off within a few hours, as I have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like waking up looking as pretty as I did the night before. (Yes I know you&#x27;re supposed to remove make-up..ohh well.)&lt;br /&gt;Use a steady hand though, the mistakes you can make putting it on might be one you wear for the day. I also got this in blue, and that color is BOLD and fun.</li>
    <li> I can wear this for up to 3 days flawlessly! It does take practice to use since it is thicker than normal liners and lasts so long.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner DOES last a long time (which is the only reason it&#x27;s not getting 2 stars), but it made my eyelids feel sticky and like they had glue on them. The brush also does not have a fine point, making it much more difficult to get a clean, bold line.</li>
    <li> I have oily eyelids and every eye liner I&#x27;ve used just rubs off in n hour or so but not this liner! It last all day and night and is truly water proof and needs to be removed with oil based eye make-up remover.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 17 and have been looking for a great eyeliner. Its been really hot and humid outside, so i needed the perfect eyeliner. And perfect it is! It doesnt smudge, flake or anything like that. It stays put ALL DAY! the only thing i hate is how its really hard to take off with my makeup remover wipes. But its nothing that a little vaseline and cleanser cant handle. Overall, this eyeliner is the best ever and i have oily skin. Wow! :)</li>
    <li> This liner stays put!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am routinely the only one in the swimming pool or at the beach whose eyes are still perfectly lined. Also, it&#x27;s great for nights at the club when you&#x27;re getting a little sweaty from all the dancing. (Have you noticed how some girls get raccoon eyes? Not me) It&#x27;s also great for those occasional \\&quot;sleepovers\\&quot; - you wake up in the morning  with your makeup still looking fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I ever recommended this to has loved the liner as well. This past xmas, I gifted the liner to my girlfriends who have always commented on how well my liner holds.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are great too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: keep tightly capped and don&#x27;t leave the brush outside of the bottle for too long. Liner will thicken-up.</li>
    <li> good liner..lbut not truely waterproof ..which is what I was looking for. ..but a truely waterproof liner is exceptionally hard to find</li>
    <li> Amazing eyeliner it&#x27;s long lasting water resistant and I love it I have been buying it for over a year and I&#x27;ll keep getting it</li>
    <li> I have heard a lot of hype about this eyeliner. Upon opening it, the formula was extremely thick and stringy and the brush was uneven, not thin and impossible to work with. Unable to return this product so I won&#x27;t be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
    <li> To test it, I surfed for 3.5 hours (had to explain why I had an extravagant cat eye), then took a shower afterwards with my regular face cleanser (Aveeno) to take it off. It. Did. Not. Budge. Since I didn&#x27;t have an oil based remover on hand (I tried olive and coconut oil- nada), I continued to wear it for the next day, then exfoliated the liner off. Ow. BTW, I also had Urban Decay&#x27;s Cannonball mascara, which also lasted surfing and shower, but came off with the olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Wipe off excess against the lip, because a lot of product will be on it when you pull it out. It&#x27;s a pretty crappy brush, so what I like to do is to buy the disposable orange tipped liner brushes and use a new one every time for a clean line.&lt;br /&gt;-If you make a mistake, it&#x27;s best to use a dry qtip and wipe off immediately (if on the lashline, wipe down towards the lash). If you use a remover (it has to be oil based), it will leave a residue that will make re-application difficult and ultimately affect the wear of the liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars, because what makes it long wearing ultimately makes it difficult to correct and remove. And the crappy brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo below is after the 3.5 hours of surfing AND shower. No flaking or smudging.</li>
