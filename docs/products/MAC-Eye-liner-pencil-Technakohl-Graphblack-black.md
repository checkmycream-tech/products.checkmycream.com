      <li>the service was great thank you !!</li>
      <li>This is the best eyeliner ever.</li>
      <li>The product is great, I use Mac all the time.</li>
      <li>I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS IS THE BEST EYE LINER FOR MY LOVELY WIFE</li>
      <li>I love all Mac products and this one specifically is the best eye liner ever.</li>
      <li>Mac products are always good quality</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>SO I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE SOON!</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner!</li>
      <li>Awesome product, was delivered on time, I was able to take with me, my fiancée loved, and she was look pretty when used on her face</li>
      <li>I got swept up in the Mac hype and although many of their products are amazing, this eyeliner is just ok.</li>
      <li>I LOVE YOU BABE, AND I WILL GIVE YOU ONLY THE BEST FOREVER AND MORE!</li>
      <li>Better than some eyeliners ive used before but</li>
      <li>I have bought this from the store and love it but wasn&#x27;t able to use the one I received in the mail.  </li>
      <li>I have since tried the gel eyeliner from Mac and like that so much more than this one</li>
      <li>I already know i love this eye liner</li>
      <li>Interesting experience with seller.</li>
      <li>Like love it .  </li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly and lasts for hours!</li>
      <li>I am so glad she did.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Goes on very easy and stays on but yet cleans off easily with my eye makeup remover as well.  </li>
      <li>excellent, lasts  almost  all day long.</li>
      <li>but I love how easily it goes on on my lower water line</li>
      <li>you can put it on your  waterline, however i experienced the opposite.</li>
      <li>It works good for my sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>This is a decent eyeliner, nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>Seriously the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>As far as staying power, it blows Lancome out of the water (even through the most rigorous workouts ---</li>
      <li>This goes on silky smooth just like my mom heard it would from a YouTube tutorial for older ladies.  </li>
      <li>if I happen to go straight from work and don&#x27;t have the opportunity to remove my makeup -- this eyeliner does not give me \\&quot;Alice Cooper\\&quot; eyes!)</li>
      <li>After I tried Mac I gave up on the expensive liners and bought a liner made by Almay, 16 hour liner, and it was wonderful.</li>
      <li>And this one is not that black more of a lighter color but all in all stays put!</li>
      <li>so now the regular cap doesn&#x27;t fit on quite right because the end cap is stuck in it.</li>
      <li>, it looks very clean, and it lasts a very long time without smudging.</li>
      <li>Though, she just made me get her a liquid liner because this pencil takes too much time for her.  </li>
      <li>But not so dumb that I was dumb enough to deduct a star for it because, honestly, this is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
      <li>On a particularly spend-happy trip to the mall</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highly pigmented and you can apply it from two angles to get the precision line you want.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft</li>
      <li>It lasts for more than 6 months, has a deep black, is water proof, everything you need on a make-up.</li>
      <li>And after a hard day at work its still there! :)</li>

    <li> Arrived quickly and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> This goes on silky smooth just like my mom heard it would from a YouTube tutorial for older ladies.  Though, she just made me get her a liquid liner because this pencil takes too much time for her.  So, she loves it but doesn&#x27;t like the time it takes to apply pencil liner - go figure.</li>
    <li> The product is great, I use Mac all the time. It did not look like in picture. Not used. Interesting experience with seller.</li>
    <li> This is a decent eyeliner, nothing spectacular. I got swept up in the Mac hype and although many of their products are amazing, this eyeliner is just ok. I give three stars because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as advertised. I have other liners that last longer and cost half the price.</li>
    <li> I previously was a devotee of the Lancome Kohl pencil. On a particularly spend-happy trip to the mall one day, I let the Mac lady talk me into this, since it&#x27;s technically the only Mac eyeliner approved for application to the waterline. I am so glad she did. As far as staying power, it blows Lancome out of the water (even through the most rigorous workouts --- if I happen to go straight from work and don&#x27;t have the opportunity to remove my makeup -- this eyeliner does not give me \\&quot;Alice Cooper\\&quot; eyes!) Admittedly, when I saw it was a twist up, I cringed. Generally, the tips of those break within a few weeks. Not this one -- though I will say, the design of the pencil case is dumb. Recently I put the cap on the end to apply -- and when I pulled off the cap, it pulled off the end cap -- so now the regular cap doesn&#x27;t fit on quite right because the end cap is stuck in it. Dumb. But not so dumb that I was dumb enough to deduct a star for it because, honestly, this is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve found to date. It&#x27;s highly pigmented and you can apply it from two angles to get the precision line you want. Totally smudgeable for a sultry smokey eye. Priced well. Buy it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I bought this item with the hopes of finding a liner that did not leave me looking like a raccoon. I have been trying different liners all summer to find one that worked and this one did not. After I tried Mac I gave up on the expensive liners and bought a liner made by Almay, 16 hour liner, and it was wonderful. It stays on all day and has never smudged yet! I am extremely happy ! The Mac liner is going in the trash because why would I use it  if it doesn&#x27;t do what I need?</li>
    <li> Awesome product, was delivered on time, I was able to take with me, my fiancée loved, and she was look pretty when used on her face</li>
    <li> I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS IS THE BEST EYE LINER FOR MY LOVELY WIFE, SHE HAS TRIED OTHER BRANDS THAT CLAIM TO BE THE SAME IF NOT BETTER, AND THEY FAILED, THEY RUN OR GET IN HER EYE, AND I CANNOT HAVE THAT. SO I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE SOON! I LOVE YOU BABE, AND I WILL GIVE YOU ONLY THE BEST FOREVER AND MORE!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner ever. I&#x27;ve used it for years. It&#x27;s very soft so I have to be careful when putting the cap back on but I love how easily it goes on on my lower water line, it looks very clean, and it lasts a very long time without smudging.</li>
    <li> Mac products are always good quality</li>
    <li> bought for my niece hope she likes it if she does it will get 5 stars the service was great thank you !! (like the little pink bag it came in, was not expecting that THANK YOU)</li>
    <li> I usually like my eyeliner  blackest black. And this one is not that black more of a lighter color but all in all stays put! And after a hard day at work its still there! :)</li>
    <li> Arrived melted.  Ugghhh...  I have bought this from the store and love it but wasn&#x27;t able to use the one I received in the mail.  I have since tried the gel eyeliner from Mac and like that so much more than this one but If you don&#x27;t like using a brush to apply eyeliner, this would be my second choice.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! It goes on so smoothly and lasts for hours! Seriously the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I read that this specific eyeliner doesnt smudge or give you &#x27;racoon eyes&#x27; &amp; you can put it on your  waterline, however i experienced the opposite. Better than some eyeliners ive used before but not what i was looking for..</li>
    <li> excellent, lasts  almost  all day long.</li>
    <li> Like love it .  It works good for my sensitive eyes</li>
    <li> I love all Mac products and this one specifically is the best eye liner ever. It lasts for more than 6 months, has a deep black, is water proof, everything you need on a make-up.</li>
    <li> I bought this on amazon as I didn&#x27;t want to make the the trip to the MAC store.  I already know i love this eye liner and I use it every day. Goes on very easy and stays on but yet cleans off easily with my eye makeup remover as well.  :)</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use- like trying to draw with a wax. Will be returning.</li>
