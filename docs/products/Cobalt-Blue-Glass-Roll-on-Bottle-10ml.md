      <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>I love this for my essential oils...</li>

      <li>One was fine, the other was chipped.  </li>
      <li>I have had no trouble with leaking or the ball not rolling in my experience!</li>
      <li>I like the dark color to prevent light in the essentila oils.</li>
      <li>Substantial little glass bottles that are easy to fill, snap the roller on, and use without drips.  </li>
      <li>The other bottle is functioning OK, but The value is not worth the price.  </li>
      <li>, such as transferring perfume from a large bottle to place in your purse, even a tiny evening bag, or carry on a trip.</li>
      <li>Must be a defect in the one I ordered since I see no other complaints of this.</li>
      <li>They are just small enough to fit in your pocket and easily take them on the go, but they hold enough oil to last a few weeks.</li>
      <li>I used to mix apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil in a little container and apply it to my blemishes with a brush, but I went through a few brushes doing this, as the hairs came loose very easily too quickly (which I think is due to the strength of these two liquids).</li>
      <li>These were just what I needed to make my blends when using my Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
      <li>If you like using essential oils and you want to make and all natural fragrance body oil.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As expected. .. came quickly and undamaged. .. works great for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Good service and will order again.</li>
    <li> When the roller is attached to the bottle, the cover won&#x27;t screw on. Must be a defect in the one I ordered since I see no other complaints of this.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly for what I needed the for. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Great for creating your own perfumes and keeping them in a container for easy use. And the amber color helps keep out damaging light.</li>

    <li> Very helpful with blends -- exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> This is one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought when it comes to my beauty product stash. I make almost all of my own products, one of them a &#x27;zit zapper&#x27;. I used to mix apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil in a little container and apply it to my blemishes with a brush, but I went through a few brushes doing this, as the hairs came loose very easily too quickly (which I think is due to the strength of these two liquids). I decided to get a glass roller like this to easily &#x27;zap&#x27; my blemishes with this solution, and it has proven to be a life saver. The product rolls on well, and I haven&#x27;t experienced the little ball getting stuck. It&#x27;s awesome, and I am so happy I found it. Worth a buy if you&#x27;re looking for the same thing I was!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get to the store that much with my two toddlers, but I was disappointed when I went I went to the expensive health care store and saw this product significantly cheaper. It does what is is supposed to do. I wish I had a case of them, but not at these prices.</li>
    <li> No leaks, but i keep them in a cupboard. Great size for many uses. Perfect little bottles, about the size of a lip gloss from the 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I use them for essential oil roll on, perfume, etc</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with these roller bottles.</li>
    <li> My favorite liniment for my sometimes aches and pains comes in a large bottle. This is wonderful because I fill this little guy with the liniment and then I roll it on right where I need it and refill as needed. Another plus is how it fits right into the required ziplock bag for carrying liquids on the airplane. Also, it is thick glass, not cheap plastic, so it can take the strongest of liniments. I am sure one can find many other uses for it., such as transferring perfume from a large bottle to place in your purse, even a tiny evening bag, or carry on a trip.</li>
    <li> Substantial little glass bottles that are easy to fill, snap the roller on, and use without drips.  The order arrived promptly and well-packaged.  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Perfect for leaving in my purse! They are solid glass and I have not had any issues!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my expensive essential oil blends.  Love them.  I would definitely purchase these again. The tops are secure and the bottle is a nice brown color.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my own mix of essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love this for my essential oils...small for travel, too!  I &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; a little lavender under my nose to help me fall asleep at night.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I bought this because I wanted a roll on applicator I could throw in my purse for my favorite perfume oil from The Body Shop. This was perfect, the oil went in nice and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> great bottles, quality rollers</li>
    <li> These were just what I needed to make my blends when using my Young Living Essential Oils. They fit perfect in my purse and easy for my family to apply their oils.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 units. One was fine, the other was chipped.  Cap is metal, makes an unsatisfying gnashing when screwed onto the glass vial.</li>
    <li> Perfect -- I love that these are glass, that the glass is dark, the roller balls (I ordered five of these) are all working smoothly. Another plus, they were packaged securely so no risk of breakage in transit. I didn&#x27;t measure how much I could put in there but I have these scattered throughout the house (labeled, of course), filled with various blends for various reasons, and they are so easy for us / children to grab and use. This is also the best price I could find anywhere.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for lavender and peppermint essential oil, mixed them with fractured coconut oil, and they work wonderfully! It&#x27;s wonderful to have a little roll-on for my toddler&#x27;s many bruises and scraps, and we&#x27;ve used the peppermint more often with headaches and such since it went in the container! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Easy To Put togther,  Great Size for carrying around.  Now no just need a label to put on them that will stand up to e.o.</li>
    <li> I love these little rollers, I put oils in them for travel. They are the perfect size and so easy to fill and refill. They always arrive super quick. I have bought them before and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Works great. Put coconut oil inside to use as lipgloss. Doesn&#x27;t leak. Rolls just fine. Delivered quickly. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these to make my own blends with my Young Living essential oils. They are a perfect size to carry in your purse, backpack, or even a pocket. I have had no trouble with leaking or the ball not rolling in my experience!</li>
    <li> Love it. Using it now</li>
    <li> Works awesome. No leaking at all. I can put it in my purse and trust it not gonna leak all over my bag.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Product is as stated.  I&#x27;ll order again when I need more!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Been working great for my essential oil blends~!</li>
    <li> Excellent roll on bottles!</li>
    <li> I found out it rolls in your skin back in your bottle of oil, sorry never used.</li>
    <li> Works great. Perfect for using essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is obviously made out of recycled glass (which is fine) but it came with a couple of imperfections in the glass that look like cracks in the glass (more like the glass was formed and cooled before it was smoothed out) and some faded silver paint from whatever was printed on the glass in its past life.  Roller ball works well.  I would purchase again for my personal use.  If I were using them for gifts or product selling - probably not.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  I use them to mix my essential oils with EVOO and EVCO.  They are just small enough to fit in your pocket and easily take them on the go, but they hold enough oil to last a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I Love it I use it for my personal all natural essential oils homemade men&#x27;s body oil. I made for myself. If you like using essential oils and you want to make and all natural fragrance body oil. I take it with me in my pocket because it depends on the essential oil you might need to use when ever need. Enclosing Thank you so much I highly Recommend This item. Peace I&#x27;m Out!</li>

    <li> Product works well. Doesn&#x27;t leak my essential oil mixture.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Works great!!</li>
    <li> They work but leak a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> Great applicator for my skin oil. It saves much more time for me to apply oil on my skin. Sooo convenient !!!</li>
    <li> not what I thought it was going to be. Way too small. I didn&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this</li>
    <li> I made my own serum for under my eyes to help rejuvenate them a bit and this roll-on bottle is great!</li>
    <li> it does the job it is supposed to do. I like the dark color to prevent light in the essentila oils. The ball is kind of ard to take  or out.  Price wise is ok. Is good for a gift with  essential oil. I would recommend  it. It would be best if it came witha little custum label however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KarlaC</li>

    <li> It works great, wished I had bought more!</li>
    <li> I bought a set of 2 bottles.  One of them promptly broke when I tried to reattach the rollerball top (after filling the bottle).  Fortunately, I was using a cloth for better grip, so I did not get shards of glass in my hand.  The other bottle is functioning OK, but The value is not worth the price.  I will not purchase these again.</li>
