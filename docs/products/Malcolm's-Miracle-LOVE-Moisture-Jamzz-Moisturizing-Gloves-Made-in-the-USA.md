### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I recommend them they are great!</li>
      <li>It was great until they fell apart.</li>
      <li>I purchased these for my mother who works with her hands a great deal.</li>
      <li>I love how they comform to my hand perfectly.</li>
      <li>She loved them and says they work great.  </li>
      <li>She loved them and found the combination very nice and helpful.</li>
      <li>The sewing is good, though, compared to cheaper gloves I have purchased elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I have had a good experience with this product.</li>
      <li>The gloves are a good quality.  </li>
      <li>The gloves don&#x27;t offer me a lot of support which I&#x27;d hoped for because they do have a fair amount of spandex.</li>
      <li>They fit my hand perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Love these gloves!</li>
      <li>I also love that they are made in the USA and are packaged in biodegradable materials!</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>She liked them.</li>
      <li>so the fit is nice for me.</li>
      <li>After one night her hands are noticeably more mosturized.  </li>
      <li>ok I&#x27;ve lost both of those a couple of times too.</li>
      <li>Beautifully smooth in the morning!</li>
      <li>I will not be buying LOVE gloves again.</li>
      <li>I love love love these gloves.  </li>
      <li>These gloves are very nice,  they also work very well as glove liners in the winter.</li>
      <li>Although I like the gloves, I would suggest that they have more siaes available.  </li>
      <li>They wash fine</li>
      <li>The lucky ladies who have received them already are really enjoying them.  </li>
      <li>If I purchased a product like this at a local store I would have returned it, but since I am stuck with it I feel they are ok because they were relatively cheap and work about as good as a pair of mittens.</li>
      <li>These gloves appear well made and are quite comfortable to wear overnight with moisturizer.</li>
      <li>They are comfortible, fit well and are well priced.</li>
      <li>The gloves aren&#x27;t all that and a cheap pair from the dollar store might work just as well</li>
      <li>I really wish these came in a bigger size because I got the socks too and they were awesome!</li>
      <li>My husband snickered at me the first time he saw me put these on, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do!!  </li>
      <li>These gloves do not have any special properties to promote moisturization and healing of the hands.</li>
      <li>But to be fair they do their job at allowing you to put on lotions and in my case sport cremes to my feet and protect the bedding at the same time as helping to keep it where you need it on your feet or hands.</li>
      <li>They are super comfy and do not bother me at night to sleep.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s happened from the very first time I used them.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>I purchased a pair of moisture gloves at a retail store years ago and have been looking for a replacement pair for a good, long time.  </li>
      <li>these are quality gloves that are very comfortable, wash well and do not loose their shape!  </li>
      <li>As a side note, I have small hands and long fingers, and these fit perfectly.  </li>
      <li>If you try to sleep with them you will have to adjust to it as you will find you wake up a bit from them being too snug at first.</li>
      <li>I put them on the first night and they ripped on the seam.</li>
      <li>The fabric is EXACTLY what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>it ripped up the first day i wore it.</li>
      <li>These work well for the intended purpose but are pretty snug.</li>
      <li>Your mind does some funny things at night sometimes</li>
      <li>After the first wash cycle the seams split.</li>
      <li>easy to wash and don&#x27;t yellow like some of the&lt;br /&gt;others.  </li>
      <li>My hands are not overly large either.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel that these gloved worked for me.  </li>
      <li>Really helps my hands.</li>
      <li>These are helpful gloves to wear at night to help moisturize your hands and work really well.</li>
      <li>I bought this coupled with the Neutrogena Hand Lotion and it really has been the answer.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>In the picture shown, they look much longer, so I feel that is deceptive.</li>
      <li>Because her skin is thinning her hands dry and chap easily.</li>
      <li>The gloves fit nice and snug although I have rather small hands and long fingers.  </li>
      <li>They are a little thicker and more durable, in my opinion, but not so thick as to make me warm during the hot months.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I like that they fit tight and are stretching because I don&#x27;t lose dexterity when I wear them and can continue to do things.  </li>
      <li>When I went to wear them a second time I had two large holes in one of the gloves.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is soft  and doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s shape.</li>
      <li>In my experience they have worked better and lasted longer (ordered my last pair in November 2012) than the simple white cotton gloves I used for a short period before they ripped.</li>
      <li>And when I wear lotion and wear them my hands feel really soft.</li>
      <li>and my hands were soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>I think I may buy a few more and keep them on hand for last minute gifts or hostess gifts.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have overly large hands, but boy did I start feeling like my fingers were little sausages wrapped in pretty casings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have small hands gloves fit nice....tight...</li>
      <li>This takes its toll and dries her hands out quickly and harshly.  </li>
      <li>They do take up some of the moisturizer and over a relatively short period of time they get sort of sticky, so need fairly frequent laundering.  </li>
      <li>I wore these for the first time last night and was only able to keep them on for about 10 minutes before they just became too uncomfortable.  </li>
      <li>only downside is that she says it&#x27;s strange to sleep in gloves which dissuades her from consistently wearing them unless her hands are really dry.</li>
      <li>and there is a little bit of extra room at the end, but not so much to hinder activity (typing this review while wearing them, as a matter of fact!)</li>
      <li>If you have large hands, they may be too tight.</li>

<li> If you have large hands, they may be too tight.</li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t look like one glove is larger on one hand either so not certain.</li>
<li> I agree with other reviewers that the process getting them on your hands (and I have smaller ladies hands)</li>
<li> Do yourself a favor and buy these for dry cracked hands.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift for the germaphobe who wash their hands raw.&lt;br</li>
<li> He has extremely dry hands in the winter.</li>
<li> My girlfriend works in a bar and her hands get so dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m using this as my hands are disgustingly dry.</li>
<li> She was complaining how dry they were</li>
<li> so it could be for some odd reason I just happen to pull it off and have to hunt for it the next morning.</li>
<li> It seems like they soaked up all the lotion on my hand, especially in the finger area because they were too tight.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve only hand washed mine and air dried.</li>
<li> I sleep in them every night due to very dry skin on my hands and because my fingertips have a tendency to crack in the winter or when I have done yard work.</li>
<li> Thes gloves are way too small and tight for me, with a little bit too much stretch, making them uncomfortably tight.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how they would be for someone who has really big hands or very long fingers--the gloves might be too tight.</li>
<li> I put moisturizer on my hands with the gloves before bed, but found that the moisturizer soaked into the cloth instead of my hands and my hands would actually become dryer than usual by morning.</li>
<li> I use such gloves quite often for moisturizing, and it&#x27;s hard to find any that have any pizazz.</li>
<li> and these are tight.</li>
<li> I have little hands</li>
<li> I think of them as small to average.</li>
<li> I have small to medium hands, yet these gloves are still tight.  </li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t even tight so not sure why this happened.</li>
<li> I have rather small hands</li>
<li> But they were too small for him.</li>
<li> would recommend these gloves for anyone who has small hands (seriously...small hands people).  </li>
<li> If you have small hands, they might work.</li>
<li> About the sizing: I have small hands</li>
<li> /&gt;FYI-Size does run small.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These gloves did not last.  They fell apart at the seams faster then I would have thought.  Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Upon others recommendation I bought some of these for family and friends for gifts.  The lucky ladies who have received them already are really enjoying them.  I think I may buy a few more and keep them on hand for last minute gifts or hostess gifts.</li>
    <li> Love these gloves! I wear them in the winter with Shea butter. Really helps my hands. The gloves are washable and do not shrink in the dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as my hands are disgustingly dry. They are comfortible, fit well and are well priced. Fast shipment. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I only wore these gloves one time. When I went to wear them a second time I had two large holes in one of the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stitch it up. That will be my last purchase for this item.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter who is a nurse and constantly washing her hands.  She was complaining how dry they were so I bought her these.  She liked them.</li>
    <li> I put on Shea butter and these gloves before bed and no more cracked hands this winter.  I like these gloves because they stay on your hands unlike a lot of cotton gloves that are out there.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Would buy again. I have small hands gloves fit nice....tight...so if you have larger hands not for you.</li>
    <li> I received these gloves for Christmas because I am a bit OCD about washing my hands and add the cold weather...it&#x27;s really brutal on my skin!  I wore these for the first time last night and was only able to keep them on for about 10 minutes before they just became too uncomfortable.  I gave them 10 minutes because I thought maybe they would stretch just a bit, but even after flexing and unflexing, there was no extra room. I don&#x27;t have overly large hands, but boy did I start feeling like my fingers were little sausages wrapped in pretty casings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these gloves for anyone who has small hands (seriously...small hands people).  Just for comparison sake, my wedding band is a size 7.  I really wish these came in a bigger size because I got the socks too and they were awesome!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my mother who works with her hands a great deal. Because her skin is thinning her hands dry and chap easily. I sent these gloves and O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s working hand cream to her for Christmas. She loved them and found the combination very nice and helpful.</li>
    <li> The gloves fit nice and snug although I have rather small hands and long fingers.  Used with moisturizing cream and my hands were soft in the morning.</li>
    <li> The fabric is EXACTLY what I wanted.  It is soft  and doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s shape. After applying lotion, the product keeps the moisture in  without  feeling like you are wearing plastic ......it breathes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel that these gloved worked for me.  It seems like they soaked up all the lotion on my hand, especially in the finger area because they were too tight.  I have little hands so I was shocked how tight they are.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to getting these. I actually bought the socks as well as the cream because winter can be brutal and needed the extra moisturizing. I put them on the first night and they ripped on the seam. It wasn&#x27;t even tight so not sure why this happened. I am sending them back ...very disappointed</li>
    <li> My husband snickered at me the first time he saw me put these on, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do!!  I slather on the lotion at night and pop these gloves on and voila!  Beautifully smooth in the morning!</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that the process getting them on your hands (and I have smaller ladies hands) just about takes off all the lotion.  If you want to avoid greasy lotion on your face while you sleep then these should do the job.  Frankly, the working hands lotion is all you need to repair damaged and cracked hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00121UVU0 OKeeffes Working Hands Cream 3 4]]</li>
    <li> These gloves do not have any special properties to promote moisturization and healing of the hands. They are a thin cotton glove without shea impregnation or a tight weave to keep lotions in. The construction is ok, but the fingers on my pair were very narrow despite my small hands. If I purchased a product like this at a local store I would have returned it, but since I am stuck with it I feel they are ok because they were relatively cheap and work about as good as a pair of mittens. Just don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> Just ordered my third pair of these. I sleep in them every night due to very dry skin on my hands and because my fingertips have a tendency to crack in the winter or when I have done yard work. I have used them in conjunction with several hand cream products and they have worked well with all. In my experience they have worked better and lasted longer (ordered my last pair in November 2012) than the simple white cotton gloves I used for a short period before they ripped. They are a little thicker and more durable, in my opinion, but not so thick as to make me warm during the hot months. I have not had any problems with laundering the gloves. I have rather small hands and there is a little bit of extra room at the end, but not so much to hinder activity (typing this review while wearing them, as a matter of fact!) and I can tell they would stretch for longer fingers. I have had a good experience with this product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy these for dry cracked hands.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift for the germaphobe who wash their hands raw.&lt;br /&gt;FYI-Size does run small.</li>
    <li> Bought to use as sold as moisturizing with lotions and potions. I bought the socks too. The gloves don&#x27;t offer me a lot of support which I&#x27;d hoped for because they do have a fair amount of spandex. My hands must be too small...I think of them as small to average. Anyway I am using the gloves and they work well enough except I find I often lose one in the middle of the night. Always the same glove. I don&#x27;t know if I pull it off myself or if it just slips off caught on bedding or what. It&#x27;s happened from the very first time I used them. But if I wear my Imax gloves over night for swelling problems they never come off ????? It doesn&#x27;t look like one glove is larger on one hand either so not certain. Your mind does some funny things at night sometimes so it could be for some odd reason I just happen to pull it off and have to hunt for it the next morning. The foot wear...ok I&#x27;ve lost both of those a couple of times too. But to be fair they do their job at allowing you to put on lotions and in my case sport cremes to my feet and protect the bedding at the same time as helping to keep it where you need it on your feet or hands. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy again probably. They wash fine and I&#x27;ve only hand washed mine and air dried.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for someone who works with paper and their hands.  She loved them and says they work great.  Would recommend them to anyone with hand dryness problems.</li>
    <li> Thes gloves are way too small and tight for me, with a little bit too much stretch, making them uncomfortably tight. My hands are not overly large either. I use such gloves quite often for moisturizing, and it&#x27;s hard to find any that have any pizazz. I will not be buying LOVE gloves again. In the picture shown, they look much longer, so I feel that is deceptive. If you have small hands, they might work. The sewing is good, though, compared to cheaper gloves I have purchased elsewhere.</li>
    <li> These gloves appear well made and are quite comfortable to wear overnight with moisturizer. I also love that they are made in the USA and are packaged in biodegradable materials! A+!</li>
    <li> I purchased a pair of moisture gloves at a retail store years ago and have been looking for a replacement pair for a good, long time.  Finally, I found them!  These gloves are very nice,  they also work very well as glove liners in the winter. As a side note, I have small hands and long fingers, and these fit perfectly.  If you have large hands, they may be too tight.</li>
    <li> it ripped up the first day i wore it. i sewed it and ripped up again. and why color white? it looks dirty even after washing.</li>
    <li> I like the way they feel. Snug. And when I wear lotion and wear them my hands feel really soft.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend works in a bar and her hands get so dry. I got these for her and we have noticed such a difference since she started wearing them.</li>
    <li> These work well for the intended purpose but are pretty snug. If you try to sleep with them you will have to adjust to it as you will find you wake up a bit from them being too snug at first.</li>
    <li> Get yourself some inexpensive cotton gloves and save some cash.  The gloves aren&#x27;t all that and a cheap pair from the dollar store might work just as well</li>
    <li> These are helpful gloves to wear at night to help moisturize your hands and work really well. About the sizing: I have small hands so the fit is nice for me. I&#x27;m not sure how they would be for someone who has really big hands or very long fingers--the gloves might be too tight.</li>
    <li> I love love love these gloves.  They are super comfy and do not bother me at night to sleep.  I love how they comform to my hand perfectly.</li>
    <li> These were for my husband to moisturize his hands at night. He has extremely dry hands in the winter. But they were too small for him.</li>
    <li> I like these gloves.  They serve their purpose -- preventing handcream from getting all over everything I touch.  I like that they fit tight and are stretching because I don&#x27;t lose dexterity when I wear them and can continue to do things.  They do take up some of the moisturizer and over a relatively short period of time they get sort of sticky, so need fairly frequent laundering.  I don&#x27;t think this is a fault of the gloves.  Just an inherent problem.</li>
    <li> Although I like the gloves, I would suggest that they have more siaes available.  I have small to medium hands, yet these gloves are still tight.  And the lotion I put on comes off before getting my fingers fully into the gloves.</li>
    <li> I have very thin fingers and these are tight.</li>
    <li> It was great until they fell apart. They lasted about a week. After the first wash cycle the seams split. After the second, they were unwearable. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> My wife is a RN and as such spends virtually 6 of her 8 working hours washing her hands.  This takes its toll and dries her hands out quickly and harshly.  I bought this coupled with the Neutrogena Hand Lotion and it really has been the answer.  After one night her hands are noticeably more mosturized.  With conistent use cracks are a non-issue and her hands have never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that she says it&#x27;s strange to sleep in gloves which dissuades her from consistently wearing them unless her hands are really dry.</li>
    <li> these are quality gloves that are very comfortable, wash well and do not loose their shape!  I recommend them they are great!</li>
    <li> The gloves are a good quality.  I have had others&lt;br /&gt;over the years.  They fit my hand perfectly.  They&lt;br /&gt;are easy to wash and don&#x27;t yellow like some of the&lt;br /&gt;others.  I just use my cream and put on gloves&lt;br /&gt;and sleep for 8 hours and hands are beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Dariah</li>
    <li> Bought because I have eczema on my hands and tend to itch them really bad in my sleep. I put moisturizer on my hands with the gloves before bed, but found that the moisturizer soaked into the cloth instead of my hands and my hands would actually become dryer than usual by morning. Not going to buy again.</li>
