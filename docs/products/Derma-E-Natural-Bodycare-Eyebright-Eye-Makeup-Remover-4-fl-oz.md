      <li>&lt;br /&gt;takes off waterproof and is easy to use</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>

      <li>It does a great job removing the stubborn mascara I like to wear and is well-rated on the EWG Skin Deep website.</li>
      <li>It moves everything from light powders to waterproof mascara.</li>

      <li>I have, in fact, ordered a bunch of Derma-e items because I liked this one so much</li>

      <li>new makeup remover :) melts away waterproof makeup!</li>
      <li>I had to clean everything remaining with coconut oil.</li>
      <li>No sting, no residue, just clean eyes.</li>
      <li>This brand is just as good and gentle as the high priced brands.</li>
      <li>have not tried for full face.</li>
      <li>I love this eye makeup remover, doesn&#x27;t burn or sting, and gets everything off gently.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t work any better than using my regular mosturizing cream.</li>
      <li>It rinses off easily, doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in your eyes, and feels gentle.  </li>
      <li>but it is easy to apply and it removes all of my makeup with gentle rubbing with my hands or a cotton ball.</li>
      <li>I love this natural makeup remover!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>The texture is fresh and soothing.</li>
      <li>use waterproof mascera and it comes right off no problems</li>
      <li>This eye makeup remover also does not leave an oily residue - it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; in about 20 seconds, so you can put eye makeup on right afterward if you wanted to.</li>
      <li>For me, it works much better than any product available at the drugstore, and just as good as the ridiculously expensive ones at the mall cosmetic counter.  </li>
      <li>It removes the make-up very well, it feels light and, most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes,they don&#x27;t sting when I use it like they did with other products!</li>
      <li>It is fairly gentle, and unless I get it directly into my eyes, I don&#x27;t have problems (and I do find that many makeup removers sting).</li>
      <li>It can irritate the eye if you put too much on the cotton pad (wear contacts that make my eyes more sensitive when they are removed).  </li>
      <li>Very gentle around the eye area and never irriates skin.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for 5 years and it is very gentle on the eye area while removing my eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>When too much of the makeup gets into my eyes - that hurts!</li>
      <li>Most eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve tried are gross and oily.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>works pretty well for eye makeup.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, light gel consistency, very little fragrance, does not sting my eyes and is just all-around a pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>Item arrived quickly, very well packaged, and exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Unless my eyes are already stinging from lack of sleep, the cool gel wipes away all traces of my eye makeup (which consists of eye primer, pencil and liquid eyeliner) completely.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes but can get away with most makeup remover brands without major stinging, but this one stings every time.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re Real&#x27; and it is a great mascara, but tough to get off.</li>
      <li>I really like it and will continue to buy.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>It is, however, fairly gentle on the eyes.</li>
      <li>Cleans up VERY well, and rates one of the safest on the EWG scale.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate the quality and attention to environment this company provides and will purchase again.</li>
      <li>It removes make up very well, even waterproof one.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re Real Mascara, and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on Benefit&#x27;s makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>It delivers real results and fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and remove the makeup well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take off waterproof mascara very well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this makeup remover. It does remove long-lasting makeup as described, but it dried out on my eyes really quickly, and made them feel tense and uncomfortable, plus my black makeup was smudged all over them with the remover all dried up on top. I had to reapply three to four times to finally get it all off my face, then wash my face to get the makeup remover off. Not fun.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used!  I use it specifically for eye makeup removal.  I put a little on a cotton swab and sweep it over my eyes.  It&#x27;s so light, no oily residue or greasy feeling leftover...doesn&#x27;t suds up like soap, NEVER irritates my (sensitive) eyes.  This bottle will last me quite awhile, but I will definitely repurchase when I run out.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product does not irritate my eyes at all and takes the makeup off well, which is what I wanted.  I don&#x27;t know that it is worth the price, but it is an effective product.</li>
    <li> Works so well! I am very impressed with this product. Not oily in anyway and feels refreshing when you apply it. My eye makeup comes off immediately.</li>
    <li> After using Almay for years, it started stinging my eyes to the point where I had to rinse out my eyes with my husbands contact solution! I tried an oily solution that worked well until I found this miracle stuff! I use flat cotton pads or circles, but a dime size on and swipe the eyes over and over until all of the makeup is off. It can appear sudsy but it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes! When too much of the makeup gets into my eyes - that hurts! But this gel is great stuff! Also, I use makeup remover every day and this stuff lasted over 4 months! Score! Really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> great product and great price</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 5 years and it is very gentle on the eye area while removing my eye makeup.  It is a natural product with no greasy residue like cold cream or other products leave.</li>
    <li> Ive ordered this several times. works great.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;ve only used this once so far. It stung my eyes a bit and it was difficult to remove my eyeliner. I had to clean everything remaining with coconut oil. I would only use coconut oil, but it tends to be messy. This make-up remover was messy also though. I will have to find something else.</li>
    <li> I like Derma E Evenly Radiant Eye Makeup Remover. Removes well and no irritation in the eyes. Good product and I will recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of makeup removers over the years, and I&#x27;ve finally found one I&#x27;ll stick with. While I don&#x27;t wear particularly heavy eye makeup, and usually don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara, this makeup remover easily takes off everything I wear. It has a nice, light gel consistency, very little fragrance, does not sting my eyes and is just all-around a pleasure to use. I&#x27;m so satisfied!</li>
    <li> works pretty well for eye makeup. have not tried for full face. no greasy feeling after which is great and very large bottle if using just for eyes.</li>
    <li> I got this product because it has a 4 star satisfaction review. I was looking for something gentle, to take off water proof eye makeup.  Water works better then this product. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great gel formula, easily goes on tip of a q--tip and dries quickly if any left on eyes after clean up. Cleans up VERY well, and rates one of the safest on the EWG scale.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It removes make up very well, even waterproof one. I like the light formula, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  It does not remove any make-up.  I switched back to my old stand-up eye make-up remover (Sephora brand)</li>
    <li> Really nice, non-greasy formula gets the job done quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes.</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover is excellent ! It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itchy like many other products. The texture is fresh and soothing. I have tried many brands but this one is my favourite. I am buying it again!</li>
    <li> This product works very well and is all natural! Great combo! I have, in fact, ordered a bunch of Derma-e items because I liked this one so much</li>
    <li> 1st time I have ordered eye make up remover so not sure how it differs from other eye make remover.  It can irritate the eye if you put too much on the cotton pad (wear contacts that make my eyes more sensitive when they are removed).  One or two swipes and the mascra is gone as well as the eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove all types of eye makeup.  Does not bother my eyes like others have.  I will putchase again!  Nicely shipped, quick and as advertised.</li>
    <li> best of all - they are cruelty free- no testing on animals&lt;br /&gt;do you know how many companies abuse animals every day? not this one&lt;br /&gt;takes off waterproof and is easy to use</li>
    <li> Love this product it def works!&lt;br /&gt;I dont know why i havent been using this product!?&lt;br /&gt;I use waterproof mascera and it comes right off no problems</li>
    <li> I love this natural makeup remover! It feels more like a serum but it is easy to apply and it removes all of my makeup with gentle rubbing with my hands or a cotton ball. It moves everything from light powders to waterproof mascara. I really appreciate the quality and attention to environment this company provides and will purchase again.</li>

    <li> In looking for a cruelty-free makeup remover, I came across this one. It&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t work any better than using my regular mosturizing cream. It is fairly gentle, and unless I get it directly into my eyes, I don&#x27;t have problems (and I do find that many makeup removers sting).</li>
    <li> I love how it removes my waterproof mascara without a lot of rubbing &amp; there is not any oil or residue in the product.</li>
    <li> I really love this makeup remover and have been using it exclusively for about 3 years.  For me, it works much better than any product available at the drugstore, and just as good as the ridiculously expensive ones at the mall cosmetic counter.  It is non-irritating and I don&#x27;t have to rub the delicate skin around my eyes vigorously. One bottle will last me about a year. Just a tip--I put a few drops on my index fingers and rub directly but gently onto my lashes for 5-10 seconds until the make-up is dissolved.  I find that a dampened cotton ball works best to wipe off all traces of mascara and other eye-makeup.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s my favourite eye makeup remover! It&#x27;s gentle and remove the makeup well. Cruelty free!</li>
    <li> This makeup remover works well to remove eye makeup, including waterproof mascara.  It&#x27;s the best makeup remover that I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> Great makeup remover. Very gentle around the eye area and never irriates skin. Works well for getting mascara or eyeliner off but be careful not to get in the eyes as it stings a little.</li>
    <li> It delivers real results and fast. No scrubbing or cause irritation. Will buy again because it has natural and organic ingredients at a great affordable price. Good size too.</li>
    <li> I use this for removing eye making (I believe it can also remove face makeup according to the Derma-E website, but I have not tried it for that yet). It is my favorite eye makeup remover I have ever tried. Most eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve tried are gross and oily. The ones that are manageable are less oily, but still leave a weird residue behind. This is much more like a gel than a liquid. The gel consistency of it makes it much easier to control how much comes out and I also find it makes it easier to remove eye makeup. I use square cotton pads and they keep their shape with this gel rather than the liquid makeup removers where the cotton pads get all soggy and bunched up. This eye makeup remover also does not leave an oily residue - it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; in about 20 seconds, so you can put eye makeup on right afterward if you wanted to. Not only that, it is so much less expensive compared to all of the mediocre and average eye makeup removers I have tried.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly, very well packaged, and exactly as described. This is a good quality product. It works very well. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> on time and as promised, works well, no residue -- very happy!</li>
    <li> Works well, non irritating, recommend</li>
    <li> Bad purchase.  This requires at least 3 swipes with 3 different cotton pads to get off all my eye makeup, and i only wear basic eyeshadow/liner/mascara.  And, it stings!  I have sensitive eyes but can get away with most makeup remover brands without major stinging, but this one stings every time.  Very dissapointed, will definitely not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take off waterproof mascara very well.  Leaves a lot still on</li>
    <li> Works great and does not irritate my eyes at all. Removes even waterproof mascara with no problem. No sting, no residue, just clean eyes. I was having a problem with other brands...even expensive, &amp;#34;eco friendly&amp;#34; formulas...irritating my eyes and disturbing my vision. Not this one...my daughter loves it too! Will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> new makeup remover :) melts away waterproof makeup!</li>
    <li> You can tell there is Aloe in it from the consistency.  It does seem to bother my eyes a little, but that might also be the mascara.  I rarely wear mascara and it might be old.  I completely trust derma-e brand and have the whole hydrating line (including the hyaluronic spray which is very very cool, especially when travelling).</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite eye make-up remover. It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t sting if you get it in your eye.  Also removes waterproof mascara well and don&#x27;t think they use bad ingredients.</li>
    <li> I will buy this product again and also considering their other products😉&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viva Derma E</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS REMOVER!! It works sooo well and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue. Derma-E is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I picked this up since I&#x27;ve had a really hard time removing Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real Mascara, and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on Benefit&#x27;s makeup remover.  The Lancome and Paula&#x27;s Choice removers that I was using just couldn&#x27;t cut through that mascara -- but this stuff does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount, and it has a really nice, cooling gel-like texture.  It rinses off easily, doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in your eyes, and feels gentle.  I really love it!</li>
    <li> I use Benefit mascara &#x27;They&#x27;re Real&#x27; and it is a great mascara, but tough to get off. I love this eye makeup remover, doesn&#x27;t burn or sting, and gets everything off gently.  I use a cottonball to apply and wipe off.  I do wash with a foamy cleanser afterwards and a washcloth and ALL the makeup is off!  No harsh chemicals (I&#x27;m allergic to Propylene Glycol).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m neither here nor there on this makeup remover.  It&#x27;s about average - I&#x27;ve seen better and worse.  It is, however, fairly gentle on the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product. Extremely gentle to the eyes and all natural. Definitely recommend to anyone and especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My eyes are very sensitive and this removes all eye makeup (even waterproof) without irritating my eyes. As a bonus - I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes getting longer since I started using it!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It does a great job removing the stubborn mascara I like to wear and is well-rated on the EWG Skin Deep website. I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Chamomile make up remover from the Body Shop and the oil-free makeup remover from Neutrogena, but I&#x27;d have to say that this one has been the best make up remover thus far. It&#x27;s a cool gel, entirely non-oily and removes my eye makeup so painlessly, that I will definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually squeeze a little onto my cotton pads, press them on my eyelids and then wipe away. Unless my eyes are already stinging from lack of sleep, the cool gel wipes away all traces of my eye makeup (which consists of eye primer, pencil and liquid eyeliner) completely.</li>
    <li> I love this eye makeup remover.  Easy to use. It&#x27;s not oily and it removes mascara without scrubbing eyelashes.  I won&#x27;t go back to the other kind where you have to remove with a pad or cotton ball.</li>
    <li> Mild and effective. Skin feels soft and hydrated after cleaning. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Does not remove waterproof mascara very well at all. Hard to wash off too. It&#x27;s a runny mess!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Works perfectly well to remove eye makeup. At the same time, it protects my very sensitive eyes with all the natural ingredients. Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This works very well and my skin is soft after using.  I really like it and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, cleanse easy</li>
    <li> The best makeup cleanser ever. It does not strip the oils from my skin, dry it out in any way, clog my pores, or irritate my skin. Finally, I have found the perfect makeup remover. I already have 2 back-up bottles in my closet! Thank you Derma e.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye makeup remover. I was using Chanel and Christian Dior before this but was getting tired of paying that much money. This brand is just as good and gentle as the high priced brands.</li>
    <li> I am really particular about makeup removers. This one I want to bathe in! It is so gentle on my eyes but seems to remove even waterproof makeup. I really stopped using the others I had and have not looked any further. Very happy with this one.</li>
