      <li>I love how nice my nails look when I&#x27;m done -</li>
      <li>Love love love this!</li>
      <li>The lotion smells nice and the buffer does an OK job, but just as good a job as the buffer I got from the dollar store, so nothing special.</li>
      <li>Not only did the buffer work wonderfully but the cuticle oil was nice.</li>
      <li>love this stuff and keep it with me all the time.</li>
      <li>In order to get them shiny again, I had to repeat the buffing with the appropriate side.</li>
      <li>I purchased one while on vacation in Alaska this summer and was greatly pleased with its performance.</li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>The products contained - from the files and buffers to the bream and oil, are all top notch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>i love the way it made my nails look and hands feel.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore it and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
      <li>but most had spilled out and</li>
      <li>I saw something like this buy WAY more $ at a kiosk in the mall.  </li>
      <li>Simply lovely and</li>
      <li>It was more like a floral perfume with kiwi accent notes.</li>
      <li>Did not seem to make my skin feel more hydrated.  </li>
      <li>was sent fast and at a good price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not exactly what I saw at the mall, but am VERY happy with it!</li>
      <li>I got something similar to this years ago at a mall kiosk and loved it!</li>
      <li>the buffer works amazingly well, the nail file works quickly, the hand cream is lovely, and the cuticle cream makes the cuticles much softer.  </li>
      <li>They were offering the full kit at the mall for $40, I got a full kit for $20 in a dented box, knowing I could probably find it online at a better price.</li>
      <li>the smell is light and clean.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and the seller made a great choice of scents (I left that choice up to them as they knew what the scents were like).  </li>
      <li>and I love it just as much!</li>
      <li>almost like they have a fresh coat of polish!</li>
      <li>Discounted it as being anything really special and put it under my sink and forgot about it.</li>
      <li>It lasts an extremely long time and is amazing in every way, i recommend this to everyone!</li>
      <li>Quick shipment</li>
      <li>This nail kit is great, but The 4 sided buffer is really all you need, it really makes my nails shine to where it looks like I have a clear topcoat on.</li>
      <li>The only con to this is the finger nail file doesn&#x27;t stay together very well, not a big deal since the reason I wanted it was for the buffing board which works great!</li>
      <li>I am very frugal with my money and rarely buy things outside of a drugstore or Walmart, but the Obey Your Body Hand Perfection Nail Care Kit was amazing.</li>
      <li>When I first got my package</li>
      <li>I bought the first one for myself.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift and now everyone wants it!  </li>
      <li>This is similar to the products in the mall but a much better price.</li>
      <li>She even used acetone nail polish remover to show me it wasn&#x27;t going to wear off after the first handwash.</li>
      <li>;) is very essay to use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, the nail file (not that I had high expectations) but the front is already peeling away from the back.</li>
      <li>The buffer makes my nails so smooth and it repairs all the damages from acrylic nails and constant polish and remover.</li>
      <li>Using this system has really helped my nails and my hands.  </li>
      <li>the q-tip didn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>Great buffing block, however the nail file is poorly made and is coming apart.  </li>
      <li>I gave this one to my daughter who really loves because of the nail oil.  </li>
      <li>I discovered this product at a kiosk in the local mall; I really enjoy the buffer and the lotion and wanted to share it.  </li>
      <li>It did so much for my hands in one use that I used it on my neck, feet and face.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>professional kit for the fine groomed male.</li>
      <li>As soon as I rinsed them in water, they were normal again.  </li>
      <li>It also lasts way longer than nail polish - a few weeks for sure.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and makes it look like you have a clear manicure without all the fumes and waiting for wet paint to try.  </li>
      <li>Your nails look like they have a clear coat of polish on them within 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>When I tried it I was  pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>Following the steps, my nails were very shiny.  </li>
      <li>I could not get the ball to stay in place when I put it back in the bottle top, it was if it was just made too small for the bottle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have ridges in my nails that cause splitting and very dry skin.  Using this system has really helped my nails and my hands.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product at a kiosk in the local mall; I really enjoy the buffer and the lotion and wanted to share it.  I have not been disappointed by the transaction at all!  It arrived quickly and the seller made a great choice of scents (I left that choice up to them as they knew what the scents were like).  I LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a friend, the box it came was very nice and showy. Was suprised how good the product smelt too!</li>
    <li> used it all the time. i love the way it made my nails look and hands feel.</li>
    <li> I got this product in the mall about a year ago and loved it. After a few months I lost it and could never find it again. Until now. I love this product. The buffer makes my nails so smooth and it repairs all the damages from acrylic nails and constant polish and remover. I absolutely adore it and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> I got something similar to this years ago at a mall kiosk and loved it! I saw this and got it and I love it just as much! This product is definitely good quality and comes in a nice box!</li>
    <li> I just received this order in the mail and I had to look it back up because it was not what I expected. The picture shows 5 items: a cuticle pusher, nail file, cuticle serum, 4-sided buffer and hand lotion. I received 3 of those things... no cuticle pusher and no nail file. It&#x27;s not worth my time sending it back. It&#x27;s just really irritating to not get what you expect. I will not order from this supplier again, and I shop on Amazon A LOT.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product that smooths and softens your skin and makes your nails look like a pro just did them</li>
    <li> This nail kit is great, but The 4 sided buffer is really all you need, it really makes my nails shine to where it looks like I have a clear topcoat on.</li>
    <li> I have never found anything that keeps my nails so shiny.  I had bought it before at a kiosk at the mall which is no longer there and was so happy to be able to get it here.  It was less expensive at this site than at other sites.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, the nail file (not that I had high expectations) but the front is already peeling away from the back. The lotion smells nice and the buffer does an OK job, but just as good a job as the buffer I got from the dollar store, so nothing special.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but I remember the quality being a lot better. I think they changed their formula or just water down their lotions now</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It performed a miracle for my nails! I absolutely love it! And the cuticle cream is like the best thing about it to me. It works so well. I have never before seen a product like that. This is just an amazing product. You are missing out if you dont have it.</li>
    <li> Did not get everything that was advertised as being in the kit. Got only 3 items. Hard to decide if the product works when you don&#x27;t get what you ordered.</li>
    <li> When I first got my package I was.a bit disappointed since I got the kiwi sent and I&#x27;ve never been a.fan of fruit/candy scents. When I tried it I was  pleasantly surprised.  Not only did the buffer work wonderfully but the cuticle oil was nice. The best part was that the lotion didn&#x27;t have a strong fruit smell. It was more like a floral perfume with kiwi accent notes.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a little pricey at first, but considering it was the price of one manicure, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve since had dozens of manicures from this kit and it&#x27;s still going.  It cleans, buffs and shines your nails like nothing else.  It&#x27;s easy to use and makes it look like you have a clear manicure without all the fumes and waiting for wet paint to try.  It also lasts way longer than nail polish - a few weeks for sure.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Got this kit as a gift. Discounted it as being anything really special and put it under my sink and forgot about it. Found it yesterday and decided to pull it out and now I am trying to find out where to find more when it runs out! It did so much for my hands in one use that I used it on my neck, feet and face. Amazing! Totally fills in my lines and wrinkles and my rough callused skin on my feet is touchably soft. I plan on using this every night before bed and every morning! Simply lovely and the smell is light and clean.</li>
    <li> Love love love this! I&#x27;m a 20 year old female aircraft mechanic so as you can imagine my hands get pretty nasty. This is amazing!! Definitely recommend. Even though it says kiwi scent it&#x27;s not super fruity it&#x27;s a nice light scent with the lotion, the cuticle oil is great, love the file and the buffing pad is marvelous!</li>
    <li> All in one nail kit, great price, service &amp; packaging! His nails have never looked so good!&lt;br /&gt;A professional kit for the fine groomed male.</li>
    <li> this is great!  I saw something like this buy WAY more $ at a kiosk in the mall.  Went home and found this online.  It&#x27;s not exactly what I saw at the mall, but am VERY happy with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and now everyone wants it!  It lasts an extremely long time and is amazing in every way, i recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I got approached by a mall kiosk salesgirl that would not let me walk off. I am very frugal with my money and rarely buy things outside of a drugstore or Walmart, but the Obey Your Body Hand Perfection Nail Care Kit was amazing. With a capitol A. In about 1 minute, this wonder salesgirl got my ridgey, acrylic damaged nails with hangnails from Hades looking like they belonged to a different human. She even used acetone nail polish remover to show me it wasn&#x27;t going to wear off after the first handwash. I wish I had photos of before and after. They were offering the full kit at the mall for $40, I got a full kit for $20 in a dented box, knowing I could probably find it online at a better price. This dear friends is a STEAL. You have to try it once. I bought the first one for myself.Now its going to be an add on for Christmas.</li>
    <li> i ordered the kit and the product is great.  the buffer works amazingly well, the nail file works quickly, the hand cream is lovely, and the cuticle cream makes the cuticles much softer.  i initially wrote that the sizes of the hand lotion and cuticle cream were not what is advertised, but the seller contacted me to let me know that the sizes posted on amazon are not correct.  the hand cream is 5.07 oz and the cuticle cream is 0.5 oz.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the price - bought extras for gifts.  Had gotten the kit several years ago as a gift - purchased at a Mall Kiosk.  Very expensive there.</li>
    <li> I gave this one to my daughter who really loves because of the nail oil.  She also likes the hand body lotion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  My nails look so beautiful and shiny when I use this and it lasts for days.  The only con to this is the finger nail file doesn&#x27;t stay together very well, not a big deal since the reason I wanted it was for the buffing board which works great!</li>
    <li> The products contained - from the files and buffers to the bream and oil, are all top notch.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and keep it with me all the time.</li>
    <li> I think I would have liked this kit if I had the opportunity to use the products the way they were intended. The file block was nice and effective and the cream seemed ok but the cuticle oil spilled everywhere when I opened it because the little roller ball came off with the lid. I could not get the ball to stay in place when I put it back in the bottle top, it was if it was just made too small for the bottle. I tried using what was left of the oil with a q-tip but most had spilled out and the q-tip didn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy the file block again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for the cuticle oil which I could not find.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great! my nails are usaully a disaster but after this kit so much better !!thank you thank you --dharris</li>
    <li> I Love it! It&#x27;s great! Best gift my mom have ever got for me on christmas;) is very essay to use and it really works.</li>
    <li> Great buffing block, however the nail file is poorly made and is coming apart.  Love the cuticle oil, great to have in my purse!!</li>
    <li> Following the steps, my nails were very shiny.  As soon as I rinsed them in water, they were normal again.  In order to get them shiny again, I had to repeat the buffing with the appropriate side.</li>
    <li> Not the best product of it&#x27;s kind really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the eraser doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i mean...i guess i was expecting a miracle but what i got is average product that does average job. but for starters, it is good.</li>
    <li> Nice supplies for nails.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable product for the price. It is not a Gucci manicure set, but golly it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with a nail buffer, filer, hand and finger lotion. The whole set feels like a solid $20 product, but you can take it home for less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell of this product. Did not seem to make my skin feel more hydrated.  I was disappointed with this product very much but I might try some other product from the line for a second chance but that would be it.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion!  It works quite well.  I have already used everything in the kit and love how my nails look!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  Love love love.</li>
    <li> The best product to put on the nails.  Quick shipment</li>
    <li> I was expecting a kyrie note but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about five years.  On my third box.  Does a great job on my nails.  A Manicure in a box.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is similar to the products in the mall but a much better price. I love how nice my nails look when I&#x27;m done - almost like they have a fresh coat of polish!</li>
    <li> so i obviously didn&#x27;t use it, but she loves doing her nails and thought this would add to her nail care products. was sent fast and at a good price so I am happy</li>
    <li> This order is intended as a Christmas gift.  I purchased one while on vacation in Alaska this summer and was greatly pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used buffers in my lifetime but nothing compares to this! Your nails look like they have a clear coat of polish on them within 5 minutes. I&#x27;m buying more as gifts!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the product</li>
