      <li>I love it and hope it never gets discontinued!</li>
      <li>But if there&#x27;s someone who can tolerate that strong alcohol-ly smell, this is a very nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate the ease of ordering through Amazon, their price is the best &amp; with free super saver shipping they can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
      <li>It has a light pleasant scent which when sprayed on clothing lasts until it is washed.</li>

      <li>My favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
      <li>Then this may have been my favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and guys love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>Mostly air and hype.</li>
      <li>I have received more compliments on this scent than I can count and my husband likes it as well.</li>
      <li>I absolutely Love this.</li>
      <li>the scent is very mild musk scent for women.</li>
      <li>It is easy to carry in her purse and leave it in her desk drawer if she needs it on the run.</li>
      <li>I guess this fragrance has to be in the oil to be true to the scent I used to love.</li>
      <li>I like it a lot but can&#x27;t fine it in the stores, might have to go to something else</li>
      <li>That being said, if you like this then it probably is true to the original spray and you would love this.</li>
      <li>so maybe someone out there will enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Great Christmas present for my self.</li>
      <li>Thanks again Amazon for I am a super satisfied customer!</li>
      <li>This is a tried and true old favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>I love Cody Wild Musk.  </li>
      <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
      <li>I used to love the old Wild Musk oil.</li>
      <li>Takes me back to a time in my life that was very sweet and cherished.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent and goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I really like this cologone and have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>But since the fragrance is light, I thought I&#x27;d try it in this form, but after using it for 2 days in a row, I had a sneezing attack for an entire week.  </li>
      <li>I use all other types of lotions that have scent and then use this over top of that</li>
      <li>I will continue to order this product through Amazon as long as they make it this affordable &amp; available.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s body spray in Wild Musk scent!  </li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding the body spray and was happy to find this for less money than I pay when I can find it at CVS.</li>
      <li>, I use it along with the Cody Wild Musk Cologne Spray.  </li>
      <li>Wish they still carried the Cody Wild Musk Oil.</li>
      <li>but so far can&#x27;t find I like.</li>
      <li>Used to wear it when i was young.</li>
      <li>It smells like old man cologne to me.</li>
      <li>Have been using wild musk for years and have always received compliments even from strangers.</li>
      <li>Really like the scent of the musk colognes and have several different ones.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t have the same smell of the Wild Musk Cologne.</li>

    <li> My favorite scent.  Have been using wild musk for years and have always received compliments even from strangers.</li>
    <li> Smells the same as the perfume but goes faster since it&#x27;s in can</li>
    <li> If you ever want to have a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; smell, this is it.  I love it and hope it never gets discontinued!</li>
    <li> Like the Musk Cologne, it was rancid.  I was again disappointed in hoping that this product having been sealed, would have smelled better.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but can&#x27;t fine it in the stores, might have to go to something else but so far can&#x27;t find I like.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent and goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love this. Used to wear it when i was young. Takes me back to a time in my life that was very sweet and cherished. Same goes for Coty Wild Musk   Body spray. Priceless</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, but the recipient loves it. Delivered as promised by Amazon.</li>
    <li> wonderful product...  arrived perfect</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over twenty years. This is the only place I can find it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Really like the scent of the musk colognes and have several different ones.</li>
    <li> Ordered 5 bottles coty wild musk body VERY hard to find, when i see it at limited stores i buy what they have, usually 2 bottles. Thank you for carring this item. My husband, Daughter,and I,use it as well as the perfume. Will order again when we run out. THANK YOU SO MUCH! AND FOR THE FAST SERVICE!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments on this, it&#x27;s very light and guys love it. I mix it with other perfumes too.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  It&#x27;s body spray in Wild Musk scent!  Love this stuff.  Long lasting. You&#x27;ll get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Love coty musk! Arrival timely. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Great Christmas present for my self.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have the same smell of the Wild Musk Cologne. It sort of had a alcohol smell. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Always used and loved this body spray!!! I wasn&#x27;t finding it in the stores where I usually buy it so I tried Amazon and there it was! So, this is where I will go from now on to get things that I want!  The shipping was great, got it when I was told I would! Makes me happy!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for years. I have a hard time finding the body spray and was happy to find this for less money than I pay when I can find it at CVS. This is a body spray though. It has a lighter smell than the actual cologne. I spray this all over my self after my shower and then use the regular cologne on my wrists and neck. I use all other types of lotions that have scent and then use this over top of that and it never clashes. I get complimented all of the time on how good I smell. I hope Coty never stops making this scent.</li>
    <li> If you like musk you will love this body spray.</li>
    <li> This is a tried and true old favorite of mine.  It always smells wonderful and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> My ladies everyday scent.</li>
    <li> For the money, this is worthless. The scent doesn&#x27;t even last long enough to get dressed and out the door. Mostly air and hype.</li>
    <li> The best body spray around.  I use it all the time.  I would suggest it to all my friends.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Good price. Getting harder and harder to find.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking buying this. It smells like old man cologne to me. I gave it away in my donation bag so maybe someone out there will enjoy it. I used to love the old Wild Musk oil. I guess this fragrance has to be in the oil to be true to the scent I used to love. I had never tried the spray in this fragrance. That being said, if you like this then it probably is true to the original spray and you would love this. Everything is personal preference when it comes to scents.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> nice scent---receive many compliments</li>
    <li> I used to use this in the oil form because I am allergic to alcohol.  But since the fragrance is light, I thought I&#x27;d try it in this form, but after using it for 2 days in a row, I had a sneezing attack for an entire week.  I then tried to use it as a room spray, thinking, maybe it just didn&#x27;t interact with my skin well, and I gave me the same reaction for the next three days.  I just lost out on this one.  But if there&#x27;s someone who can tolerate that strong alcohol-ly smell, this is a very nice fragrance.  Sorry that the oil has been discontinued.  Then this may have been my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> I really like this cologone and have been using it for years. It has a light pleasant scent which when sprayed on clothing lasts until it is washed. I have received more compliments on this scent than I can count and my husband likes it as well. I don&#x27;t like heavy flowery scents, they give me an instant headache! I appreciate the ease of ordering through Amazon, their price is the best &amp; with free super saver shipping they can&#x27;t be beat! I will continue to order this product through Amazon as long as they make it this affordable &amp; available. Thanks again Amazon for I am a super satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> She loves her Coty body spray. It is easy to carry in her purse and leave it in her desk drawer if she needs it on the run.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It is very hard to find in any retail store. The shopping experience is great and you get your product quickly</li>
