      <li>/&gt;It is also very sturdy and would make a great \\&quot;war-games\\&quot; mask.</li>
      <li>better get this if u looking for a good mask ;)</li>
      <li>Very strong, fit well.</li>
      <li>I can see perfectly fine for the most part though.</li>
      <li>Broke and shattered easily and bbs went through it like butter.</li>
      <li>and I was easily one of the creepiest looking people on Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price is such a great deal for an item that would probably cost way more anywhere else.</li>
      <li>I had it painted with acrylic colors for carnival and everything turned out fine.</li>
      <li>Best value plastic mask you can buy, doesn&#x27;t get toooo hot, the only problem I have is that I wanted like 30</li>
      <li>My problem though with this mask is that it doesn&#x27;t have a snug fit.</li>
      <li>I will say I thought this mask was going to be one of those cheap, plastic ones...</li>
      <li>I made a face attachment for my heavy boxing bag with it and it is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Solid plastic, looks great...</li>
      <li>It is comfortable and the plastic has \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; so it can be painted or drawn upon.  </li>
      <li>It fit well ad was breathable while wearing.</li>
      <li>Plus the face used in this mask is much better facial structure wise.</li>
      <li>The paint wipes of is if u clean it on time</li>
      <li>It is by far my favorite and I will purchase more.</li>
      <li>but there is something about the way it fits that makes me feel like i dont get full field of view.</li>
      <li>This a really cool mask.  </li>
      <li>Gave them as present, friend loved them.</li>
      <li>Very useful for fun and games</li>
      <li>its fits your face perfectly , but i would perfer white next time</li>
      <li>/&gt;Awesome price and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Very good quality thick plastic</li>
      <li>I used a silver Sharpie and designed my own individual death eater&#x27;s mask.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty cool looking mask</li>
      <li>This mask is worth it.</li>
      <li>it was worth the 8 bucks scaring the Hell outta my co-workers...</li>
      <li>it works great!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need to grind off the little pieces of plastic inside left by the mold to make it more comfortable but a minute or two with a dremel tool took care of that nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, very smooth on the face and very durable and thick.</li>
      <li>so it was protected a lot more than the white mask.</li>
      <li>This mask is thick and of great quality.</li>
      <li>actually ordered two and am thinking of ordering more.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the mask for paintball on any other contact sport, but I did use it to scare a few people and it worked great!</li>
      <li>Good hard construction, exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a larger head and it did fit pretty well.</li>
      <li>It is strong and obviously takes a lot of punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>and now everybody wants to borrow it.</li>
      <li>The mask is still wearable but the eyes and mouth cannot both be in the right spot at the same time</li>
      <li>I ordered a white one and it came in a small box without much protection but this mask came in a nice sized box with bubble wrap</li>
      <li>and you got a new horror character.</li>
      <li>They just simple hot glue it.</li>
      <li>From Airsoft/Paintball protection it will more than suffice and the fact that it&#x27;s Midnight Black with a truly Blank Expression</li>
      <li>wow this thing is legit.</li>
      <li>It smelled very moldy and had to be washed throughly with soap prior to even trying it on.  </li>
      <li>but i was under the impression that it was a soft plastic.</li>
      <li>this is actually the exact same mask as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always on the look out for decent photography props - especially masks.</li>
      <li>cheap and really small</li>
      <li>The quality is great - I can&#x27;t see how it can be advertised as a shield - it&#x27;s decently hard and thick, but I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s brittle.  </li>
      <li>The mask is too small for my face, but obviously it may be fine for others.  </li>

<li> The mask is too small for my face, but obviously it may be fine for others.  </li>
<li> it is of very high quality and very firm.</li>
<li> I am 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34; tall so I am not small, but I am not huge either.</li>
<li> The eye holes are a little large so, if I were able to wear it, I would have to add a considerable amount of black face paint around my eyes or it would look bad</li>
<li> The mask is nice and durable, not quite the same quality as the white one I ordered, on the black one I needed to shave off some plastic left over but nothing to bad.</li>
<li> Other than that very tiny design flaw, it&#x27;s a very sturdy, thick mask that fits just about anyone.</li>
<li> This is a solid mask of very thick and durable pvc plastic with a very durable adjustable strap.</li>
<li> Bought this mask for a film I&#x27;m making, and it does look pretty scary, especially at night.</li>
<li> Also there is no padding in the mask, so it can feel rough on the skin.</li>
<li> The nostrils and other holes also seem a little bigger in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> There was a nick on the forehead area where the white from the inside of the plastic was showing because a small strip of the black surface was peeled up.</li>
<li> It is creepy looking and has a very matte black surface as you can see in the photo.  </li>
<li> Bought this on Amazon for less than nine bucks, put some black makeup on my eyelids and around my eyes, wore black sweatpants, a knit hat and a hoodie</li>
<li> /&gt;nice size, firm, durable</li>
<li> I should&#x27;ve returned it and asked for another one but the mask is bend out of shape and that causes it to not fit snug on your face.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s really sturdy unlike those crap blank masks you get at the Halloween store.</li>
<li> /&gt;Plastic is thick - this is not a one and done disposable number like other masks.</li>
<li> The company is so lazy to use needle and some thread to sew the strap when it connects to the mask.</li>
<li> If you want a scary as heck mask, buy this, a black bandana and a black coveralls</li>
<li> It also comes with a pad to keep the hard plastic off your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a goalie mask or anything, but for paintball, or for what I needed it for (cut it off halfway to use as a hard liner for a bandana for a motorcycle)</li>
<li> I saw this and envisioned a creepy cemetery shoot, the model all in black.</li>
<li> Are you serious?</li>
<li> I was extremely disappointed with this mask once the white mask came in.</li>
<li> I was wrong, its a hard plastic...</li>
<li> Received two of these broken</li>
<li> This mask is so creepy in it&#x27;s simplicity.</li>
<li> I was so wrong!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m always on the look out for decent photography props - especially masks. I saw this and envisioned a creepy cemetery shoot, the model all in black. Going to try it next week.  The quality is great - I can&#x27;t see how it can be advertised as a shield - it&#x27;s decently hard and thick, but I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s brittle.  It also includes a foam pad, adhesive tape on one side, that you can insert, cut to pieces, different shapes, etc. to make the fit comfortable and perfect. Perfect for an adult face - not a kid&#x27;s mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ordered two and am thinking of ordering more.</li>
    <li> Best value plastic mask you can buy, doesn&#x27;t get toooo hot, the only problem I have is that I wanted like 30 but they sold OUT!?!?!?</li>
    <li> came face and it was great plastic</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the mask for paintball on any other contact sport, but I did use it to scare a few people and it worked great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re looking at buying this mask, but just let me tell you, buy this. It&#x27;s nice, very smooth on the face and very durable and thick. If you&#x27;re going to use it for paintball, it&#x27;s perfect. If you&#x27;re going to use it to scare the s*** out of someone, it&#x27;s perfect for that too!</li>
    <li> I have a larger head and it did fit pretty well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the strap. The company is so lazy to use needle and some thread to sew the strap when it connects to the mask. (Think of them sliding the strap through a slit then fastening the strap to itself) They just simple hot glue it. Are you serious? I&#x27;ll just sew it myself or have the wife do it. Also there is no padding in the mask, so it can feel rough on the skin.</li>
    <li> The mask is nice and durable, not quite the same quality as the white one I ordered, on the black one I needed to shave off some plastic left over but nothing to bad. The nostrils and other holes also seem a little bigger in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome price and quick shipping.</li>

    <li> I ordered a white one and it came in a small box without much protection but this mask came in a nice sized box with bubble wrap so it was protected a lot more than the white mask. My problem though with this mask is that it doesn&#x27;t have a snug fit. I think I might have just got a bad one. I should&#x27;ve returned it and asked for another one but the mask is bend out of shape and that causes it to not fit snug on your face. I was extremely disappointed with this mask once the white mask came in.</li>
    <li> Very strong, fit well. Gave them as present, friend loved them.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for... it arrived with a crack in the chin... but it served its purpose...</li>
    <li> it was worth the 8 bucks scaring the Hell outta my co-workers... Thanks.</li>
    <li> its fits your face perfectly , but i would perfer white next time</li>
    <li> Good hard construction, exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use this as face protection in FMA, will edit with results.</li>
    <li> This a really cool mask.  I ordered it for my Halloween Death Eater&#x27;s costume.  It is comfortable and the plastic has \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; so it can be painted or drawn upon.  I used a silver Sharpie and designed my own individual death eater&#x27;s mask.  It turned out wonderfully and I have already gotten tons of compliments on it. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it to a Halloween party on the 28th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also very sturdy and would make a great \\&quot;war-games\\&quot; mask.</li>
    <li> Creepy Very Creepy!!!</li>
    <li> Received two of these broken</li>
    <li> This mask IS GREAT! It&#x27;s durable, fits perfectly, and it&#x27;s fun to look at. I have no complaints regarding this PERFECT item!</li>
    <li> Bought this mask for a film I&#x27;m making, and it does look pretty scary, especially at night. I might apply some eye-shadow for the actor who wears this because the eye holes are rpetty big and show some skin. Other than that very tiny design flaw, it&#x27;s a very sturdy, thick mask that fits just about anyone. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is a solid mask of very thick and durable pvc plastic with a very durable adjustable strap. From Airsoft/Paintball protection it will more than suffice and the fact that it&#x27;s Midnight Black with a truly Blank Expression it has a Creep Factor that was validated over Halloween. I have since taken the Mask and with painters tape used an Olive Drab pvc paint to Tiger Stripe Camo it and the result is excellent for running Tactical Operations.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in tact. It fit well ad was breathable while wearing. I had it painted with acrylic colors for carnival and everything turned out fine.</li>
    <li> I got this mask for a Haunted Hayride I am doing. This mask is so creepy in it&#x27;s simplicity. And it&#x27;s really sturdy unlike those crap blank masks you get at the Halloween store. Plus the face used in this mask is much better facial structure wise. If you want a scary as heck mask, buy this, a black bandana and a black coveralls like i did and you got a new horror character. This mask is worth it. The price is great too.</li>
    <li> Tested it as soon as I received it with a 400 FPS pistol and it did not withstand the shots. Broke and shattered easily and bbs went through it like butter.</li>
    <li> I went on a mask buying binge, and this was one of them. It is by far my favorite and I will purchase more. his is a must-buy item.</li>
    <li> Great! Solid plastic, looks great... No can tell who you are when you put it on.  Bought one for my bro and I, we love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this on Amazon for less than nine bucks, put some black makeup on my eyelids and around my eyes, wore black sweatpants, a knit hat and a hoodie and I was easily one of the creepiest looking people on Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic is thick - this is not a one and done disposable number like other masks.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;It looks really good.  It is creepy looking and has a very matte black surface as you can see in the photo.  It also comes with a pad to keep the hard plastic off your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- It smelled very moldy and had to be washed throughly with soap prior to even trying it on.  Smell was on all parts (i.e., mask, strap, and pad)&lt;br /&gt;- The mask is too small for my face, but obviously it may be fine for others.  I am 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34; tall so I am not small, but I am not huge either. The mask is still wearable but the eyes and mouth cannot both be in the right spot at the same time&lt;br /&gt;- The eye holes are a little large so, if I were able to wear it, I would have to add a considerable amount of black face paint around my eyes or it would look bad&lt;br /&gt;- There was a nick on the forehead area where the white from the inside of the plastic was showing because a small strip of the black surface was peeled up.</li>
    <li> this is actually the exact same mask as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FOFDJW/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a great mask.&lt;br /&gt;nice size, firm, durable&lt;br /&gt;elastic is well attached</li>
    <li> cheap and really small</li>
    <li> Very good quality thick plastic</li>
    <li> i love this mask!! i took a lot of pics and upload them on fb and now everybody wants to borrow it. it just AMAZING!!! better get this if u looking for a good mask ;)</li>
    <li> This is a pretty cool looking mask but i was under the impression that it was a soft plastic. I was wrong, its a hard plastic...thats my mistake.</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted although my purpose was not what it was designed for.  I made a face attachment for my heavy boxing bag with it and it is perfect.  It is strong and obviously takes a lot of punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James</li>
    <li> The mask is great it got here on time and fits perfect . The paint wipes of is if u clean it on time</li>
    <li> wow this thing is legit. it is of very high quality and very firm. i like it a lot but there is something about the way it fits that makes me feel like i dont get full field of view. I can see perfectly fine for the most part though.</li>
    <li> Very useful for fun and games</li>
