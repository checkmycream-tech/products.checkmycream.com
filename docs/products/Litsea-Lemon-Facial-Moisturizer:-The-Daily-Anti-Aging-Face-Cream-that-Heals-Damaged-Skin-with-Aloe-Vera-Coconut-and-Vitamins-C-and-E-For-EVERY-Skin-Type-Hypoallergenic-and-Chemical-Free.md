      <li>I highly recommend it and am looking forward to trying other products from Organic Fields of Heather.</li>

    <li> I  have been really loving this face cream! It keeps my skin nourished and moisturized, which  I need some extra moisture in the Fall and Winter months. The scent of this cream is lemon so if you are not a fan of lemons then you won&#x27;t like this cream. I  have oily acne prone skin,  and  this cream doesn&#x27;t break me out. If anything it has made my acne heal faster and as of right now I have clear skin! I am happy I stumbled upon this brand! I  am excited to try some other products and maybe even give some as Christmas gifts. I love that everything in this cream is organic and natural, and it is very affordable! Shipping was fast and there was tracking too. I  am happy with the products I bought and would recommend them to anyone who likes affordable, natural and effective skincare!</li>
    <li> Excellent facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like this alot.  Seems a little heavy, but then skin just drinks it in.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer overall.  It is a little on the greasy side, but tolerable with very dry skin.  I love the smell too... very lemon-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging definitely looks different than the image shown, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> The smell was not too bad but the product was just ok to me. Seemed a bit oily for me as well.</li>

    <li> Even though this is a totally natural product, it has a scent that isn&#x27;t that pleasant to me.  For the title Lemon Crush, I guess I was expecting more of the fresh scent of lemon but the lemon is very subtle and there are other scents combined with it that don&#x27;t smell good together, in my opinion anyway as I can smell things very strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to wear it on my face but I have chronic dry eyes and ones sensitive to cosmetics and lotions so it doesn&#x27;t work for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty container though.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing! The price is even more amazing!</li>
    <li> Oily but I love this skin cream</li>

    <li> This is my second order.  I will continue to order this product.  For the price and quality it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! The fact that it is all natural and organic for the price is amazing. I have only applied it a couple of times and already notice a big difference in the feel and look of my skin. My skin is very sensitive and dry and nothing has ever worked. I highly recommend it and am looking forward to trying other products from Organic Fields of Heather.</li>
    <li> Just amazing. Must buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought 2! They were on sale so I figured, why not? Shipping was fast.

I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and I already notice a difference in how my skin looks. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to buy this brand. Can&#x27;t really complain, I&#x27;m getting great results and it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
