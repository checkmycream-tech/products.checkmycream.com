      <li>I usually love Mary Kay products.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This works great for my 50 year old blemish prone skin.  </li>

      <li>Since I have been using this product my face has been problem free.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased so far.</li>
      <li>I have oily and acne prone skin, but this toner makes my skin feel clean for once.</li>
      <li>Really does the job, and it&#x27;s definitely my favorite toner out there, I would repurchase in a heart beat, no question.</li>
      <li>If it helps my mild acne, then I guess I will have to take the burn.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive, combination type skin that breaks out with acne very easily.</li>
      <li>The first toner that I&#x27;ve been using since was Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel toner.</li>
      <li>Kay has great products - I first started off with one and discovered its other products.</li>
      <li>When I noticed that I was getting a large bump I made sure I applied it to my face and even held it there for about a minute just to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t get any bigger.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;m acne free</li>
      <li>I used this toner along with natural lemon teatree soap and velocity moisturizer for about 2 weeks and my face got better like it was a lie.</li>
      <li>I use this along with the facewash and clarifying mask and my skin now is clear and looks fantastic!</li>
      <li>It smells funny, but not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>sure she will be back to this one .  </li>
      <li>I have to go back to my original routine and original toner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried various spot treatments over the years and this is one of the better ones.  </li>
      <li>To start off, I&#x27;m a 18 year old male who really takes good care of his skin.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using it</li>
      <li>I wiped it all over my face with a cotton pad and immediately my whole face burned!</li>
      <li>After about 2 weeks of consistent use you will see your skin&#x27;s appearance begin to improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost through my first bottle and my skin has certainly cleared up.</li>
      <li>As an impoverished college kid, it was more affordable for me to purchase a new set of facial product than going to a derm&#x27;s office all the time.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this product as well</li>
      <li>but I had nothing to lose since my whole face already looked like a volcano that was about to erupt.</li>
      <li>very dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>Really works for toning and blemish control</li>
      <li>cause it stung so much that it was unbearable.</li>

      <li>This really works to keep off acne.  </li>
      <li>Formula 3 toner about a week ago and have been using it for the past few days and already notice a great difference in my skin!</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin you may want to use every other day as it is very strong.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t always wear a lot of make-up, but when I do, I like to use this particular toner.</li>
      <li>I love it and have already noticed fewer blemishes on my skin (which I haven&#x27;t thought possible for a very long time)</li>
      <li>What can I say , this is the first and only toner that I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I have no reason to explore .</li>
      <li>It was a complete night mare.</li>
      <li>I have never been completely sold on Mary Kay products but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been battling with adult acnes for years but this time, it almost made me cry every day literally.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 21 years old and from time to time I have problems with acne and blemishes.</li>
      <li>I can usually take pain, but the burning sensation was so intense that I had to get my blowdryer and blow my face on cool mode lol.&lt;br</li>
      <li>New blemishes were developing everywhere, white heads, clogged pores....</li>
      <li>This product really gets the dirt off my skin unlike any other product.</li>

    <li> Excellent product.  I would recommend this product to everyone with oily skin.  I have been using it for many years.</li>
    <li> I had been having trouble with dry spots, breakouts just a mess! I tried other products and ran across this one. Read the reviews decided to give it try and I LOVE IT.  I use this along with the facewash and clarifying mask and my skin now is clear and looks fantastic!</li>
    <li> The #3 MK Blemish Control Toner is one of the better astringent products on the market - and reasonably priced! It contains 2% salicylic acid that penetrates the external layer of the skin and reduces the appearance of pores. Another added bonus is it gradually fades blemish hyper pigmentation scars and other discolorations or unevenness. After about 2 weeks of consistent use you will see your skin&#x27;s appearance begin to improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a faithful MK user (off and on) for the last 15 years. The reason I always return to MK is the quality of the products, and buying them through Amazon at a discounted rate is nice!</li>
    <li> I have to go back to my original routine and original toner but it may work diff for some people</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Proactive toner in the past, but stopped after a while since I didnt notice any difference in my skin besides it being a little more dried out than before. I bought this Mary Kay Formula 3 toner about a week ago and have been using it for the past few days and already notice a great difference in my skin! I have extremely sensitive, combination type skin that breaks out with acne very easily. I decided to give this toner a try (after a beauty consultant recommendation to use a toner in my daily skin care regimen) and am so happy that I did. I wash my face every night before bed and assumed that it was clean, but after using this toner and seeing what was still left over on my cotton pads after washing my face, I was kind of disgusted. It gets off all the small dirt and makeup particals that I left behind after washing my face. I love it and have already noticed fewer blemishes on my skin (which I haven&#x27;t thought possible for a very long time)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toner.  This works great for my 50 year old blemish prone skin.  I love being able to get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have never been completely sold on Mary Kay products but this I will continue to buy in the future. I&#x27;m 21 years old and from time to time I have problems with acne and blemishes. Since I have been using this product my face has been problem free. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months now and for me that is un heard of. When I noticed that I was getting a large bump I made sure I applied it to my face and even held it there for about a minute just to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t get any bigger. It burned for about a minute or so afterwards but when I woke up a few hours later the bump had actually shrank and was gone within 24 hours. I have never had a product that worked so well. I love this product and its a must have for even adults with the occasional acne.</li>
    <li> The toner arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  I ordered it for a work associate and she is happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various spot treatments over the years and this is one of the better ones.  Just use it when you need to.  It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin like some of the other products out there either.</li>
    <li> I had stopped using the blemish control toner for about a year and in during that time I tried other ways to deal with my blemishes.  I couldn&#x27;t get them under control and returned to this product.  My skin has cleared up.</li>
    <li> What can I say , this is the first and only toner that I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I have no reason to explore . It does the job of tightening my skin with each use .</li>
    <li> Really works for toning and blemish control</li>
    <li> To start off, I&#x27;m a 18 year old male who really takes good care of his skin. The first toner that I&#x27;ve been using since was Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel toner. I buy it from my local Walgreens. I&#x27;ve been wanting to use a better brand toner so after reading the reviews on this Mary Kay product, I decided to go ahead and purchase it since I already use Mary Kay&#x27;s Time Wise Moisturizer and love it. The product came right on time(I have Prime lol) and it was in a well package bottle. Very cute and great quality. It smells funny, but not unpleasant. So after going through my skin routine(which is my Neutrogena facewash accompanied by my Olay ProX facial brush and oatmeal scrub), I continued with the Mary Kay toner. I wiped it all over my face with a cotton pad and immediately my whole face burned! I can usually take pain, but the burning sensation was so intense that I had to get my blowdryer and blow my face on cool mode lol.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only dropping a star because of the burning feeling. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to burn since there is Salicylic Acid or maybe my face was too dry? Anyone else have the same problem? This was my first time using it so I will continue to see how well the product is. If it helps my mild acne, then I guess I will have to take the burn. This toner will dry your face like most others, so I made sure to follow with a good moisturizer and so should you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have an update shortly!</li>
    <li> Yes Love my Mary Kay.  I can always tell if I don&#x27;t use it daily!</li>
    <li> A few months ago, my face was breaking out worse than ever before. I&#x27;ve been battling with adult acnes for years but this time, it almost made me cry every day literally. I could not bear looking at my own face in the mirror. New blemishes were developing everywhere, white heads, clogged pores.... It was a complete night mare. As an impoverished college kid, it was more affordable for me to purchase a new set of facial product than going to a derm&#x27;s office all the time. Benzol peroxide never worked on my skin so I knew salicylic acid was my best option. I was searching for acne products for days and finally came across with this along with velocity set. I was still skeptical whether this will work on me but I had nothing to lose since my whole face already looked like a volcano that was about to erupt. As I was checking on list of ingredients, I noticed alcohol denat, citric acid, and menthol. Thought those can be harsh and oh yes they were so harsh that they made me literally cuss out loud cause it stung so much that it was unbearable. I put a good amount of toner on a cotton pad and swept around the face after I washed my face. Sometimes there&#x27;s residue on a cotton pad meaning my face wasn&#x27;t washed thoroughly. I repeat the step til I don&#x27;t see residues on the cotton pad. I used this toner along with natural lemon teatree soap and velocity moisturizer for about 2 weeks and my face got better like it was a lie. I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;m acne free but I don&#x27;t get terrible blemishes like I did before. I&#x27;m very pleased so far. Hope they never change the formula because it works the best as it is.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always wear a lot of make-up, but when I do, I like to use this particular toner. It helps to remove the extra make-up that my cleanser does not. I&#x27;m very sad that the Mary Kay company as decided to discontinue this product. I&#x27;m thankful that I was able to find someone that had some. It arrived promptly and in good condition. I would absolutely recommend this product as well the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you!</li>
    <li> arrived just as advertised, in a timely manner. Was glad to receive!</li>
    <li> Really does the job, and it&#x27;s definitely my favorite toner out there, I would repurchase in a heart beat, no question.</li>
    <li> This really works to keep off acne.  You apply using a cotton pad.  After waiting a minute or two for it to dry, I proceed with my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Kay has great products - I first started off with one and discovered its other products.</li>
    <li> Daughter Switches from one MK Product to another lm sure she will be back to this one .  It does workShe just rotates .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost through my first bottle and my skin has certainly cleared up. The only thing is that I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this formula, or if any other toner might work the same way. I&#x27;m not willing to find out, though, and just bought my second bottle!</li>
    <li> Alcohol. You might as well buy rubbing alcohol. It&#x27;s the same thing. Not impressed. I usually love Mary Kay products. This one doesn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
    <li> This works so amazingly well, I was pleasantly suprised. It smells kind of wierd, but it works wonders. I have oily and acne prone skin, but this toner makes my skin feel clean for once. I love this and I would recommend to anyone that is looking for a toner, to stop looking! Just try it, it is very cheap for the results it gives. I love it. Order it now!</li>
    <li> This product really gets the dirt off my skin unlike any other product. If you have sensitive skin you may want to use every other day as it is very strong.  But it works!</li>
    <li> I ordered what was posted and received  something else. very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I guess my wife likes it.  She wanted it.</li>
    <li> I have had acne issues and this toner has helped so much. Usually products dry out my skin and I have used this twice a day and it hasn&#x27;t at all. I sometimes pair it with the blemish cream too</li>
