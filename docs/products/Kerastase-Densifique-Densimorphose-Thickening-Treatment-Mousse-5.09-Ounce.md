      <li>It&#x27;s now one of my favorite hair products</li>

    <li> Excellent for my fine, thin hair, not drying</li>
    <li> LOVE IT ..... USE IT.....TOTALLY worth the $$.  I have fine long hair that gets weighed down if I use to many products.  This product allowed me to ditch all my products for just 1.  It only takes a orange slice amount to get the look I want.  :-)</li>
    <li> I have bought the original kerastase mousse (in the blue bottle) from my salon and loved it.  This one, I found to be drying and Gave me no volume. It also kind of smelt like hair dye. Not sure if it&#x27;s the real product or not since I&#x27;ve never used it before?</li>
    <li> Product is very good but the container was defective.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of adding volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product sense my stylist of 15 years used it on my gray color treated hair and recommended hair about a year now. I highly recommend it for anyone for anyone who has hair that breaks easily, is dry, which is blown out. I recommend this product if as I do you have thick but limp hair or ( I&#x27;m not in this category but many of my friends who now use this product are) have thin limp hair. This product does not make your hair crispy, or sticky. I&#x27;ve stopped using hair spray. I do use along with this product when I&#x27;m styling the Kerastase Volumizing spray in the green container. Also sold on Amazon. Price on Amazon better than the salon or Rue La La</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Best thickening mousse ever!!</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair soft and well condition.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have thin hair and this product makes my hair look healthier and thicker.  I also have curley hair and it helps control my hair from getting frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have thin, blonde hair that is also very fine.  This product works and I use it spareling as I am allergic to so much, so far the hair looks great,, holds the style and I have no rash or break out.  I am in Florida and the humidity is awful, yet the style held all day.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> If you have spent any time in Europe, especially France, you know what &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; really means.  This mousse is exactly that and is worth every cent.  I PROMISE!!!  I have *never* smelled a hair product with such a luxurious scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My process with this mousse is two-fold.  First, I put a few squirts (you don&#x27;t need much) and massage it thoroughly into my towel-dry hair, then I style with a blow dryer.  Second, I take a very small squirt and spread it all over my hands and then run it through my hair.  This gives the hair sheen and tames any flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not it replaces hair, but the aromatherapy aspect of it is worth it.  I just wish I were staying in a 5 star hotel in Paris getting ready to go to a Michelin 3 star hotel.  This product is *that* good.</li>
    <li> Great mousse! Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Depends on your definition of thickening.  Will it make it SLIGHTLY thicker?  Yes.  Will it give you full body?  No way.</li>
    <li> wonderful but expensive</li>
    <li> I have course naturally curly hair that I wear in a short cut.  When my stylist recommended this mousse I thought no way!  My hair is very poofy naturally and I have never needed mousse, nor enjoyed the feeling of it in my hair.  She proved me wrong.  I use only a small amount on towel dried hair, work it through starting in the back and side and then the top of my hair.  I let it dry a little before blow drying with a round brush and my while my hair does feel thicker, it also has shine and body and renewed texture that doesn&#x27;t look or feel unnatural.  My hair remains soft and repels humidity (my hair&#x27;s enemy) to a degree.  In short, my hair is much more manageable with Keratase than without.  It also looks younger and healthier. While expensive, I find that the 1.5 oz size lasts a long time, so I believe it is well worth the price.  It&#x27;s now one of my favorite hair products and I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> This really does thicken the hair and I love the texture and fragrance.  This is high quality mousse, hands down the best mousse if you want a thicker fuller head of hair.  The salon I go to, this is the go-to mousse and they can&#x27;t keep it in stock as every stylist loves using it and it flies off the shelves.</li>
