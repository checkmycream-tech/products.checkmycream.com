      <li>I like the fragrances and the basket its nice too!</li>
      <li>She loves ECO products and loved the scent of this bath set.</li>

      <li>She loved it.</li>
      <li>Very pleased</li>
      <li>and she really liked it</li>
      <li>Nicely packaged and shipped.</li>
      <li>the scent is more</li>
      <li>Looks better than it smells.  </li>
      <li>but they are ok.</li>
      <li>Good price &amp; fast delivery.</li>
      <li>True to picture!</li>
      <li>Very cute basket and arrangement and the bottles were decent sized.</li>
      <li>I did not want to give it as a gift and look cheap.</li>
      <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t buy this gift was the way they listed the original price to be over 2000.00.</li>
      <li>I got this as a gift for a friend and when I got the box I was pretty satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used the product yet, so I can&#x27;t say whether or not it&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>I had to combine two into one to make it reasonably full.</li>
      <li>The basket was pretty cheap too.  </li>
      <li>Though probably meant to be funny..</li>
      <li>What a cute looking kit, which led me to purchase it for my teenage daughter.  </li>
      <li>I might even buy this again for myself haha!</li>
      <li>Was better than expected.</li>
      <li>I originally was going to give this as a gift, but then I could not because the brand name on it is actually \\&quot;Economy\\</li>
      <li>Despite the appealing look, I was immediately turned off by this kit due to the highly chemical-based floral scent for these products.  </li>
      <li>Everything seemed pretty good, the only complaint I have is the puffy scrub ball.</li>
      <li>Overall, it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever been more turned off by a scent than I am by this one...</li>
      <li>Her skin is sensitive</li>
      <li>Ironic that it&#x27;s called Eco bath set when every item in it is double wrapped in plastic.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say, I went to the store to buy something more appealing and will either throw this one in the garbage or donate it due to the $9 they want for returning the product.  </li>
      <li>Shows poor taste if it&#x27;s to be a reputable company.</li>

<li> But, its about what I expected for the low price.</li>
<li> Can I give this less than 1 star?</li>
<li> the products when a little bit small</li>
<li> Well, I also thought it was going to be late for her birthday-nope.</li>
<li> An offensive scent combined with poor customer service by way of an expensive return policy makes this product fall squarely on the &amp;#34;pass&amp;#34; list.  </li>
<li> It literally made me sick to my stomach.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> It was about 3 inches in diameter, a very disappointing size.</li>

    <li> I got this as a gift for a friend and when I got the box I was pretty satisfied with it. Very cute basket and arrangement and the bottles were decent sized. Everything seemed pretty good, the only complaint I have is the puffy scrub ball. It was about 3 inches in diameter, a very disappointing size. Overall, it was worth it. Nicely packaged and shipped.</li>
    <li> Very good size!  True to picture!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for a resident at a home my DH works at. She loved it. Good price &amp; fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Like said this was for a lady friend I knew back in the day for her brithday and she really liked it</li>
    <li> I bought this for a girlfriend of mine. She LOVED it. Her skin is sensitive so she uses a lot of hypoallergenic hygienic products. I thought this might have been a gamble to get her for her birthday. Well, I also thought it was going to be late for her birthday-nope. It was ON TIME! Maybe that was by chance though..&lt;br /&gt;I think its a great pampering gift for anyone guy or girl the scent is more neutral.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, She loved the products! She said the scent was great and she didn&#x27;t break out or anything. Also I want to add that I think the price was really great too I think it has all the essentials like soap, shampoo, conditioner, sponge, etc. so you could probably take it on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will check to see what else they have for a future purchase! I might even buy this again for myself haha!</li>
    <li> the products when a little bit small but they are ok. I like the fragrances and the basket its nice too!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  When I opened it the bottles were dented and worn looking.  They used that dot of glue to secure the bottles and it was really hard to remove that glue without destroying everything.  The basket was pretty cheap too.  I was going to give this as a gift but ended up keeping it.  The upside, the Eco products were good.</li>
    <li> Beware, the amount of things you get in these boxes is much smaller than you might realize. I had to combine two into one to make it reasonably full.</li>
    <li> Bought this bath set for my mother. She loves ECO products and loved the scent of this bath set. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Can I give this less than 1 star? What a cute looking kit, which led me to purchase it for my teenage daughter.  Despite the appealing look, I was immediately turned off by this kit due to the highly chemical-based floral scent for these products.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever been more turned off by a scent than I am by this one... It literally made me sick to my stomach.

An offensive scent combined with poor customer service by way of an expensive return policy makes this product fall squarely on the &amp;#34;pass&amp;#34; list.  Don&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
    <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t buy this gift was the way they listed the original price to be over 2000.00. Though probably meant to be funny..it wasn&#x27;t. Shows poor taste if it&#x27;s to be a reputable company.</li>
    <li> Ironic that it&#x27;s called Eco bath set when every item in it is double wrapped in plastic.  And it came all the way from China.  Looks better than it smells.  But, its about what I expected for the low price.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  Was better than expected.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the product yet, so I can&#x27;t say whether or not it&#x27;s good.  The reason for the low score is because I felt like the brand is misleading.  I originally was going to give this as a gift, but then I could not because the brand name on it is actually \\&quot;Economy\\&quot; and you can&#x27;t tell that by the picture, it looks like \\&quot;Eco\\&quot; as in eco-friendly.  I did not want to give it as a gift and look cheap.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it and so did my wife.  They are loved the look, the feel, and the style of it.</li>
