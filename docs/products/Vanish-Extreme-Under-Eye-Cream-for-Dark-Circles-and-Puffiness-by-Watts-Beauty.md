### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t totally PERFECT looking...</li>
      <li>The price, however, is very good.</li>
      <li>The best I can do is use a good concealer, and make the best of my \\&quot;smoky-eyed\\&quot; look.</li>
      <li>I have beautiful skin otherwise and do not like to wear foundation and cover ups.  </li>
      <li>My esthetician told me that my eyes looked good.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m going to stick with it because of how good it feels.</li>
      <li>The packaging that I have noticed some complaints on was good</li>
      <li>Works and feels good.</li>
      <li>Of course, nothing gives you absolutely perfect results, but I have been looking for a good solution to my dark, puffy undereyes for years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is magic in a jar!  </li>
      <li>Now, it is no longer so effective.  </li>
      <li>If you have something that works with great results and quick please let me know at mikexstar@gmail.com.</li>
      <li>The puffiness is a bit better, but just a bit.  </li>
      <li>I love it...and will use it till i&#x27;m 100.</li>
      <li>Using it once or twice a day, the darkness went from medium (which most folks see on themselves as hideous and disfiguring. . .)</li>
      <li>Perhaps if I used it EVERY day, I would see better results by now.  </li>
      <li>Often times I feel comfortable without wearing foundation at all!  </li>
      <li>and I think it may have irritated my undereye skin more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;s a nice eye cream but for the time-being I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in the way my eyes look.  </li>
      <li>It feels good the first time u use it.  </li>
      <li>, it is cheap oil .  </li>
      <li>It even feels cheap.</li>
      <li>1) it is oily and shiny and  cheap looking  </li>
      <li>cheap stuff  3) container is contaminateable  4)</li>
      <li>I am sure overall this is a good product, but it wasn&#x27;t for what I purchased it for.</li>
      <li>so I stir it each time before applying-a small inconvenience for the great price and results!</li>
      <li>My eyes are no longer puffy at all, and they are significantly lighter.  </li>
      <li>to mild rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>This product is good, but I don&#x27;t seem to be getting the extent of results expected at this time.  </li>
      <li>as it turns out, it wasn&#x27;t worth even the postage.</li>
      <li>it solidly reduces that bumpy, kind of \\&quot;fatty\\&quot; tissue</li>
      <li>It is very gentle too and does not burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>This eye cream works exactly like it promises.  </li>
      <li>I am just finishing my second jar and am on here to place an order for 2 more jars.</li>
      <li>After using many different and expensive eye creams this has the best consistent results.</li>
      <li>Once thing i have learned is that you do have to be consistent and dilligent when you find something that works for you.  </li>
      <li>The light creamy formula applies smoothly and it is a little greasy and oily  </li>
      <li>I really did not see improvement</li>
      <li>Gentle to my eyes though since I wear contacts.  </li>
      <li>However, it does work really well.  </li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for an eye cream that would really help me with puffy eyes.  </li>
      <li>All in all, it has done better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve suffered many years with dark circles and been trying to find a product that REALLY WORKS.</li>
      <li>But there are many of us who have dark circles through genetics, and I have come to the conclusion after much trial and error that there are no miracle cures.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s neither better nor worse than many other creams available on the market.  </li>
      <li>I think the product was changed in the new year because the product does not need to be shaken ever!</li>
      <li>I stopped using it for a little while between jars and used a couple of other products but the results were nowhere as good as Vanish.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product after reading some of the other reviews.  </li>
      <li>I had medium dark circles, mostly under my eyes, and moderate puffiness.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work by keeping my under eye area moisturized and feeling and looking soft.</li>
      <li>---naturally our eyes won&#x27;t look 20.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend this product.</li>
      <li>However heredity probably cant be fixed with a cream.</li>
      <li>Vanish Extreme under eye cream is really doing what it says it would do.</li>
      <li>The vanish extreme under eye cream may work for others, but it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me</li>
      <li>About 6 or so months ago I ordered this for the first time and started realizing results within a few days.</li>
      <li>My puffiness was under conrol when I used this the first few times.  </li>
      <li>I do not feel remotely like that anymore---and it takes like 3 days to have NORMAL feeling undereyes.  </li>
      <li>I was trying to find a good product that was less expensive.</li>
      <li>so I figured worth a try, after a few days my skin was very irritated, almost like a burn under my eyes, I figured, maybe it was part of the process and continued using for a few more nights, but it got even worse and then painful, looks like a burn (from a hot pan or curling iron)red, dry and cracking skin under my eyes where I applied this stuff on top of the dark circles,</li>

<li> I will definitely be purchasing more of the Vanish Eye cream as i do not want to be without it.. and the price is terrific.. a lot less expensive than other eye creams that did absolutely nothing for my under eye puffiness and circles.</li>
<li> I used this product for at least 4 weeks day and night and saw a little improvememt, but I expected more</li>
<li> But your undereyes FEEL flat, unpuffed out, and smoother.  </li>
<li> Apparently VANISH eye cream has worked for some of the other reviewers but its done nothing for me.  </li>
<li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and have seen absolutely no change in my dark under eye circles, i&#x27;m not sure if I have given it enough time but for the amount of time i&#x27;ve used it it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the money.</li>
<li> It arrived in a timely manner, but the actual product was not of the quality that I expected.  </li>
<li> Not sure if maybe my skin is just sensitive?</li>
<li> Also I don&#x27;t sleep well and was having regular dark circles as a result.</li>
<li> I can only comment on dark circles</li>
<li> After months of seaching for an eye cream for very dark under eye circles i can finally say i have found something that is working!  </li>
<li> My under eye circles lightened dramatically after only a few days.</li>
<li> I see absolutely no improvment in my undereye circles or puffiness.</li>
<li> I think most eye creams are worthless after trying several; however, this one seems to help in long-term.</li>
<li> A little bit of the cream goes a long way but there arte no guaranties that it will work well on any given day.</li>
<li> Sorry to say this product did not do very much for that problem.  </li>
<li> I used VANISH extreme under eye cream for 30 days every morning and night.  </li>
<li> Definitely not worth the $16.00 dollars.  </li>
<li> I do not have dark circles, but I do have puffiness.  </li>
<li> It also seems to be diminishing the dark circles but it has taken a month before I saw results.</li>
<li> I did not see any difference in my dark circles.  </li>
<li> I have always had severe dark circles and problems with puffiness until I found this product.  </li>
<li> I have genetic hyperpigmentation (dark circles as a result of heredity).  </li>
<li> The product lightened up my dark circles some, but still have just slightly lighter circles under eyes now.   </li>
<li> I have noticed a slight difference in my dark circles also.</li>
<li> I bought this a few weeks ago hoping to reduce dark circles and puffiness under my eyes and it was the cheapest of all the products</li>
<li> It maybe lessened the darkness a little bit but not like it advertised.  </li>
<li> in little poochy bags.  </li>
<li> I have very dark circles under my eyes</li>
<li> Dont waste your time and money.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> Very little progress after months, but it still did seem to help a little.</li>
<li> The product is called Vanish Extreme under eye cream for dark circles and puffiness, sadly it didn&#x27;t vanish either one.</li>
<li> Product is a home mixture and is runny and not effective.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed that this product did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
<li> I used this product for approximately 6 weeks.  </li>
<li> total crap !!</li>
<li> you will be sorry buying it   Saeed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Dont waste your time and money. Buy a brand you recognize. Product is a home mixture and is runny and not effective. I was promised a refund months ago and never received it. BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> I have genetic hyperpigmentation (dark circles as a result of heredity).  I used VANISH extreme under eye cream for 30 days every morning and night.  I did not see any difference in my dark circles.  Apparently VANISH eye cream has worked for some of the other reviewers but its done nothing for me.  Thank goodness for concealer.</li>
    <li> This product is good, but I don&#x27;t seem to be getting the extent of results expected at this time.  I do not have dark circles, but I do have puffiness.  It has reduced the puffiness somewhat, and I admit that I do not remember to use it EVERY day.  Perhaps if I used it EVERY day, I would see better results by now.  All in all, it has done better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Therefore, I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and have seen absolutely no change in my dark under eye circles, i&#x27;m not sure if I have given it enough time but for the amount of time i&#x27;ve used it it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product after reading some of the other reviews.  I was very disappointed that this product did absolutely nothing for me.  Well, I suppose it did provide some moisture, but that&#x27;s about it.  After using for one month, I see no improvement.  That&#x27;s not to say it doesn&#x27;t work for some people. But there are many of us who have dark circles through genetics, and I have come to the conclusion after much trial and error that there are no miracle cures. The best I can do is use a good concealer, and make the best of my \\&quot;smoky-eyed\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an eye cream that would really help me with puffy eyes.  Sorry to say this product did not do very much for that problem.  Gentle to my eyes though since I wear contacts.  I am sure overall this is a good product, but it wasn&#x27;t for what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> I used this product for approximately 6 weeks.  I really did not see improvement and I think it may have irritated my undereye skin more.  I have since purchased a hypoallergenic (made by dermalogica) under eye cream.  If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I followed instructions but did not work for me but did not see any improvements at all. It might have improved with using another jar but did not want to go the route.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It did absolutely nothing. I was trying to find a good product that was less expensive. as it turns out, it wasn&#x27;t worth even the postage. I used it religiously and nothing whatsoever. It even feels cheap.</li>
    <li> 1) it is oily and shiny and  cheap looking  , it is cheap oil .  2) needs to be shake before use , this is cheap stuff  3) container is contaminateable  4) you will be sorry buying it   Saeed</li>
    <li> I have used Vanish every night for a month. I see absolutely no improvment in my undereye circles or puffiness. It is as if I&#x27;m not using anything.  Very disappointing and I will be requesting a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;s a nice eye cream but for the time-being I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in the way my eyes look.  It&#x27;s neither better nor worse than many other creams available on the market.  The price, however, is very good.</li>
    <li> After months of seaching for an eye cream for very dark under eye circles i can finally say i have found something that is working!  Vanish Extreme under eye cream is really doing what it says it would do. It actually de&#x3D;puffs my under eye bags and i see a gradual lessening of the purple, blue circles that accompanied them.  Once thing i have learned is that you do have to be consistent and dilligent when you find something that works for you.  I will definitely be purchasing more of the Vanish Eye cream as i do not want to be without it.. and the price is terrific.. a lot less expensive than other eye creams that did absolutely nothing for my under eye puffiness and circles. Try the vanish cream, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It maybe lessened the darkness a little bit but not like it advertised.  Definitely not worth the $16.00 dollars.  Very disappointed...</li>
    <li> The product lightened up my dark circles some, but still have just slightly lighter circles under eyes now.   LK</li>
    <li> I am just finishing my second jar and am on here to place an order for 2 more jars. After using many different and expensive eye creams this has the best consistent results. I am 51 and my eyes were staying puffy underneath almost all the time. About 6 or so months ago I ordered this for the first time and started realizing results within a few days. Also I don&#x27;t sleep well and was having regular dark circles as a result. Both of these disappear with this cream. I stopped using it for a little while between jars and used a couple of other products but the results were nowhere as good as Vanish. Yes the cream and oil will separate so I stir it each time before applying-a small inconvenience for the great price and results!</li>
    <li> The product is called Vanish Extreme under eye cream for dark circles and puffiness, sadly it didn&#x27;t vanish either one. I was very disappointed and in this economy now one can afford to spend money on products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this eye cream but I tried it and have to admit that it helps puffiness around the eyes. It also seems to be diminishing the dark circles but it has taken a month before I saw results. A bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> OK....been using this for abt 9  months.  It feels good the first time u use it.  Within 5 minutes your puffy, eyebags seem to decongest.  Over time...it solidly reduces that bumpy, kind of \\&quot;fatty\\&quot; tissue that puffs-up as we age....it isn&#x27;t totally PERFECT looking...we&#x27;re aging---naturally our eyes won&#x27;t look 20.  But your undereyes FEEL flat, unpuffed out, and smoother.  I personally, hated the way i always felt like i had water under my eyes....in little poochy bags.  I do not feel remotely like that anymore---and it takes like 3 days to have NORMAL feeling undereyes.  I love it...and will use it till i&#x27;m 100.</li>
    <li> Im 38 and have been noticing darkness and puffiness under my eyes. I bought this a few weeks ago hoping to reduce dark circles and puffiness under my eyes and it was the cheapest of all the products so I figured worth a try, after a few days my skin was very irritated, almost like a burn under my eyes, I figured, maybe it was part of the process and continued using for a few more nights, but it got even worse and then painful, looks like a burn (from a hot pan or curling iron)red, dry and cracking skin under my eyes where I applied this stuff on top of the dark circles, Not sure if maybe my skin is just sensitive? but I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I have been using this for several months. took photos then and now,,,,NO CHANGE WHAT SE EVER !! total crap !!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about a week and have noticed some improvement with the undereye bags. The packaging that I have noticed some complaints on was good and I actually only had to stir the product once and it seemed to remain stable. The light creamy formula applies smoothly and it is a little greasy and oily  but you just have to monitor the amount you use. I have noticed a slight difference in my dark circles also. I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use the product will do what it claims. All in all the product seems to be doing what it claims. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used this product for at least 4 weeks day and night and saw a little improvememt, but I expected more</li>
    <li> My puffiness was under conrol when I used this the first few times.  Now, it is no longer so effective.  A little bit of the cream goes a long way but there arte no guaranties that it will work well on any given day.</li>
    <li> This eye cream works exactly like it promises.  Of course, nothing gives you absolutely perfect results, but I have been looking for a good solution to my dark, puffy undereyes for years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  My eyes are no longer puffy at all, and they are significantly lighter.  Often times I feel comfortable without wearing foundation at all!  I truly recommend you give this a try.</li>
    <li> As I have stated, the only thing that vanished was my money for this junk!</li>
    <li> I have been using Vanish cream for about four weeks now.  I had medium dark circles, mostly under my eyes, and moderate puffiness.  Using it once or twice a day, the darkness went from medium (which most folks see on themselves as hideous and disfiguring. . .) to mild rather quickly.  The puffiness is a bit better, but just a bit.  I am hopeful that with continued use that both issues will be reduced.</li>
    <li> Works and feels good.</li>
    <li> I am unable to use it.  this cream burns so badely it makes my eye water. I have very dark circles under my eyes and I was hoping to avoid a DR..</li>
    <li> I think the product was changed in the new year because the product does not need to be shaken ever! It does say on the directions to shake it but you do not have to. I think most eye creams are worthless after trying several; however, this one seems to help in long-term. I can only comment on dark circles I did not use the product for anything else. It doesn&#x27;t give you a temporarily relief look - it seems to want to heal the problem, but it doesn&#x27;t perform miracles. Very little progress after months, but it still did seem to help a little. If you have something that works with great results and quick please let me know at mikexstar@gmail.com.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely manner, but the actual product was not of the quality that I expected.  It looks homemade, both the packaging and actual product.  However, it does work really well.  My under eye circles lightened dramatically after only a few days.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic in a jar!  I have always had severe dark circles and problems with puffiness until I found this product.  I have beautiful skin otherwise and do not like to wear foundation and cover ups.  Since I started using this product a year ago, I only wear mascara and lipstick.  That is all!  Give it a try!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!Janine BAlabama</li>
    <li> very moisturizing. My esthetician told me that my eyes looked good. It is very gentle too and does not burn or irritate my eyes. I will try an under eye cream and move on to the next one but I&#x27;m going to stick with this brand. It seems to work by keeping my under eye area moisturized and feeling and looking soft. I never see anti aging effects from any cream including this one but I&#x27;m going to stick with it because of how good it feels.</li>
    <li> The vanish extreme under eye cream may work for others, but it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me, I&#x27;ve suffered many years with dark circles and been trying to find a product that REALLY WORKS. Does anyone have any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me. However heredity probably cant be fixed with a cream. Was hoping it&#x27;d work but did not.</li>
