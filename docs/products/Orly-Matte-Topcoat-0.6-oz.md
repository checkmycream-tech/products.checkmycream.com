      <li>I love the texture too.</li>
      <li>I ordered this top coat after trying to decide which brand to purchase.  </li>

      <li>I love the matte look</li>
      <li>Worth the money for sure!  </li>
      <li>I was worried it might not work it&#x27;s magic on the Gelish polish, but it does just fine.  </li>

      <li>If you want a nice clear top then here ya go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice touch if you want something different.</li>
      <li>but it better be good because I waited so long for this!</li>
      <li>Nail fun!</li>
      <li>It worked even better than I had thought it was going to and it stays on for the entire time that your nail polish stays on and it looks amazing.</li>
      <li>My natural, unbuffed nails are shinier than this top coat!</li>
      <li>Good extra protector.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Arrived 3 days early! Amazing quality and did NOT come broken. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m hooked on the matte finish. This one goes on easy dries quickly and always looks great.</li>
    <li> this polish is perfect for a guys nails,keeps them looking neet as we can&#x60;t wear colors,it also keeps them from chipping.</li>
    <li> It worked even better than I had thought it was going to and it stays on for the entire time that your nail polish stays on and it looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I use this on my shiny polishes to get a matte finish. It lasts longer than using this over matte polishes.</li>
    <li> Works great! Really good for layering between coats of white polish too.</li>
    <li> its good.  i wish i didnt have to have a minimum word count for this review. waste of time. yeah</li>
    <li> Orly makes another awesome product!  This matte topcoat is great.  Unlike some others I&#x27;ve read about that take forever to dry and are sticky, this one isn&#x27;t like that at all.  It makes your nails matte while going on smooth and easy.  If you do as it instructs and wait until your nailcolor is completely dry before applying the matte topcoat, then dry time won&#x27;t be a problem.  Worth the money for sure!  Nail fun!</li>
    <li> This matte top coat was just what I was looking for. My nail technician loves it and I&#x27;m ordering some for him. It&#x27;s versatile because you cN choose any color and give it a matte finish.</li>
    <li> Not only does this topcoat take gratuitously long to dry, it doesn&#x27;t dry down to a matte finish. It also makes my polish chip sooner than when I use no topcoat at all. Buy another brand that actually dries matte. You can buy topcoats of a higher quality at a drugstore for less money.</li>
    <li> This item works like they say in the description. I use the matte polish first then add the cream colored polish over it and the polish just glides on nicely.</li>
    <li> Horrible topcoat! It smears nail art no matter how long you wait or how carefully you apply it. It doesn&#x27;t smooth out your polish like all other topcoats, you can see any brush strokes or bumps. Also, it is supposed to be fast-drying, but I went to bed 2 hours after I did my nails &amp; still woke up with sheet prints. Lastly, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call the finish matte. It definitely isn&#x27;t high shine, but not really matte either, kind of in between. I absolutely would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wanted a matte topcoat polish for so long and was very excited to get this. It works but doesn&#x27;t deserve 5 stars..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It provides a matte coat that looks great over any color&lt;br /&gt;Dries quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is horrible and makes the room reeks of the worst nail polish smell&lt;br /&gt;The coat seems to fade after maybe 5 days, leaving your nails shiny again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s nice to have but when I run out of this I&#x27;ll try a different brand</li>
    <li> I love the matte look it gives some of my polishes. I did notice it didn&#x27;t work too well for my silver polish, but besides that, it&#x27;s great. You do have to wait for your nails to completely dry before you apply this topcoat, or it will be a little mushy feeling lol.</li>
    <li> I usually love Orly products, but the matte top coat is horrible.  It DOES NOT make a matte finish at all.  I thought that maybe once it dried completely it would create the finish it is supposed to.  Nope.  It&#x27;s more like a normal top coat that doesn&#x27;t dry fast and doesn&#x27;t keep your polish from chipping.  It&#x27;s such a shame because I was really looking forward to using this regularly...I love the matte look.  I guess I&#x27;m going to have to keep shopping around for something that actually works.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> I love this top coat. It takes 2 or 3 coats to work, but then it is really matte. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes your nail polish easy to peel off.</li>
    <li> I kept searching for matte black polish, but could never find any. Then I found this, and it works perfectly. Any color of polish I own now can be made matte with this topcoat. Very cool product.</li>
    <li> It looks bad, like you have an icky film over your nails. I tried it with different colors and it always strikes me as dirty or old looking. It does apply easily.</li>
    <li> Wonderful option to make beautiful unusual styles on your nails. What is good about it is that you can turn any of your favourite nail polishes to pure matte. I recommend to combine glossy and matte style at the same time. It looks stunning!!!!</li>
    <li> Good extra protector.</li>
    <li> Large bottle that mattes in just one coat. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> was happy to find,,,, most store don&#x27;t carry this, or are out of stock....&lt;br /&gt;great polish for men who don&#x27;t want shinny nails, but the buff look!!!!</li>
    <li> Gives a great matte finish but it wears off within two or three days, and the nails become a little shiny. Not a huge deal, you can just give them another coat but it&#x27;d be nice if it lasted. It dries really quickly too.</li>
    <li> Gives the perfect matte finish and dries quickly. I&#x27;ve used it on several different polishes, and the results are always stunning. I love it! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who likes to paint her nails in creative ways.  She loved this product. It works just as advertised. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It looks great it dries fast.  I love it!!! It is a very nice way to chance your mani in less that a minute. Also it works on top of UV GEL.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because my nails still chipped the very next day. On the plus side, it keeps the matte finish, it doesn&#x27;t make it shiny like I feared it would.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Terrible can&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
    <li> So, I really love the matte finish look especially if it&#x27;s doubled up with the regular top coat and a matte finish tip almost like a french. I&#x27;ve seen pictures of a black polish with the top done in matte and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since. So, I tried to get my own matte topcoat and do it myself. Unfortunately, I think it needs more directions than apply one or two coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me three tries to get this to come out matte. I first applied it to what I thought were dry nails, or fairly close to and I didn&#x27;t see any results so after I did all 10 nails, I went back and reapplied. I think that was my mistake. So, anyway, I started painting my nails at 6:30pm and went to bed around 11pm my nails were apparently, still wet because a few of them got pillow marks. I&#x27;m thinking this stuff takes a bit to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that being said, I took to top coat to work and ran a quick coat over my left hand. All of them came out matte except for my thumb. So now I&#x27;m thinking, is the polish mixing with the matte and making it shiny? Something is not working right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m not super pleased. I&#x27;m going to go home and try again with a different polish underneath and see how that goes. I&#x27;ll use an Orly color as well.</li>
    <li> If you want to try matte top coat without paying for one of the expensive ones? This is worth it. My polish didn&#x27;t start chipping till 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> make my nails very soft, love it</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Gelish polish that looked matte, and it wasn&#x27;t, which was a shame because it&#x27;s too close to another expensive Gelish polish I already owned.  Oh well....this on top is perfect!  I was worried it might not work it&#x27;s magic on the Gelish polish, but it does just fine.  One coat and I had the matte look I wanted!  It dried quickly, went on nicely, and I really have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use on my clients and the product worked as advertised.  I tried it on black and the color turned matte as expected.  Just remember to let the color dry completely before applying the top coat.</li>
    <li> I used two coats of this over an Essie polish, the effect wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as I had hoped for, for nail art purposes, but it did give the polish a unique look.</li>
    <li> I got this product fast--within 3 days. It works great! Makes any polish very matte. Dries quick and goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really nice. Within a few seconds post-application, the matte takes hold and most of the gloss goes by the wayside. It&#x27;s only a topcoat so you cannot honestly expect 100% matte. However, this will do away with at least 95-97% of it. Keep in mind that the glossier your base is, the harder it will be to make it matte. I like it a lot and am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m in love with this nail polish. it stays on and dries fast. and it looks amazing. non expensive either. shipped fast.</li>
    <li> works just like it is suppose to gives a really nice matte finish would recommend this to any one that would want a matte finish.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> The matte topcoat dries fast and produces a nice matte effect in just one coat. To make it last even longer, apply a regular top-coat (like a no-chip kind) before the matte.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Amazon wish list, I found an item my 22 year old was asking for. She does her own nails and I overheard her talking about a product that mattes the finish of any nail polish.  I found your product on her wish list and it was a very good price. Very prompt delivery. Thanks :-)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got sent the wrong one or what but this doesn&#x27;t even turn it matte at all. Just a plain topcoat. Waste of money and Very disappointed with the result. If you want a nice clear top then here ya go. not worth the money. go buy a freaking 1.00 one htough not this crap.</li>
    <li> I love this topcoat. It does a great job turning shiny nails matte. Drying time is pretty average. Works great for matte designs on shiny nails too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this top coat after trying to decide which brand to purchase.  I am very happy with the results.  I always use a top coat so I am happy to finally have a matte option.  Now any color I own can be matte!  It also dries pretty fast.</li>
    <li> This top coat is amazing! You can put it over any polish and get a matte finish. It really looks cool over glittery polish!</li>
    <li> The Orly matte topcoat is amazing! it dries quickly and looks great. The price is reasonable considering that these mattifying topcoats fly off shelves in stores.</li>
    <li> This topcoat adds a thickness to my nails that is just okay. It does create a wonderful matte effect to all of the polishes I&#x27;ve thrown it on but I feel I would use it more if it was a thinner solution.</li>
    <li> Absolutely live this product!!! Let your nail polish dry before you apply this! It works wonders on every single nail polish doesnt have to be an expensive one!!!! Defenetly buy this for your matte nails frenzie!!!</li>
    <li> This dries faster than most matte top coats (which is still a while) and is truly matte. My natural, unbuffed nails are shinier than this top coat! For those who use Seche Vite, remember to let your nail art dry before applying, as it will smear the designs you worked so hard on!</li>
    <li> this is my first time using anything matte. I love this! I would deff buy again! Best part, you can turn any color pollish into a matte finish with this top coat</li>
    <li> This product was a very good deal for mr because the rice is low and it really works to give my polish a matte look.</li>
    <li> I love it, dries instantly, I used it over black polish and does exactly what it says. No complaints at all</li>
    <li> Love this polish. It totally changes up the look. And, I swear it dries super fast. I like it on top of French manicure so it doesn&#x27;t look so fake.</li>
    <li> I love this matte top coat! I have wanted one forever and just received it today. It is the only one that I will ever use. Not only does this create the best matte finish, it dries fast, which in my case is awesome. Essie&#x27;s takes a while to dry which i do not like. I am such a nail fanatic and this is such a great addition to my collection. I love the texture too. Not the chalky feeling kind. Orly has done it again!</li>
    <li> Works well with other nail polish brands. Love the matte feel on my nails :) It also dried up really fast and prevented bubbles on my nails.</li>
    <li> not as matte as I would like.</li>
    <li> Works great on plain polish with no pearl or sparkles in it.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I was overwhelmingly disappointed with this product. I ordered this looking for a MATTE nail polish. The kind that has NO SHINE. Instead, I get a nail polish that is supposed to be extra shiny. It&#x27;s fine if you want a good top coat with shine, but if you order it based off of the title, then you will be extremely unhappy with what you receive. I couldn&#x27;t even return it when I found out it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, so I&#x27;ve spent too much money on a nail polish that I don&#x27;t even want in the first place. Don&#x27;t let the title fool you. At least I can use it as a top coat, too bad I could have gotten a top coat for a buck at the dollar store. All in all, don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> A great product, one I&#x27;ve been looking for for a while! I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase; I use it over almost every colour I have now (which is... a lot). I love love love it!</li>
    <li> excellent product,  girlfriend loves it, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I have several matte top coats and this one dries the quickest and the smoothest.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times and always get complements.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as my first foray into the world of matte polish.  At first, I was worried that using a matte top coat instead of actual matte polish would produce results that left something to be desired... but I needn&#x27;t have worried at all.  Not only does this provide the versatility I was looking for (obviously being able to use it with any color), the finish is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Product applies easily and cleanly over polish.  Not too thick or thin, brush is pretty standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a nice matte finish.  To me, it looks about the same finish as \\&quot;satin\\&quot; wall paint, after one coat.  This was sufficient for me, so I didn&#x27;t apply a second.  Even with one coat, your nails are definitely NOT shiny anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dries fast!  This is important to me, as I had very little patience waiting for my nails to dry to begin with -- and even less now that I&#x27;ve got a new baby to take care of.  I managed to get two coats of quick-dry polish AND a coat of this top coat on and dry before my LO woke up from her nap -- maybe an hour, to be on the safe side.  Changed a diaper immediately and not a single smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to observe any negative qualities, here... but I suspect that, as most fast-drying formulas do, this top coat will thicken over time and well before I&#x27;ve finished the bottle.  Will update with results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, 6-22-13: This stuff is still amazing.  I don&#x27;t use it that often, but the formula is still a dream and hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of thickening.  10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but this polish is the real deal. I loved it and tried matte-ing almost all my polish colors. Fun and a must-have for any nail fanatic.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;ll make any color I choose to wear a matte color. It&#x27;s a very nice touch if you want something different.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but it better be good because I waited so long for this! I don&#x27;t know why it took so long while other stuff that I odered at the same time arrived days before this one does.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says it does. I&#x27;m not sure what happened to the people who said it doesn&#x27;t work- when I apply it over my polishes, it&#x27;s kinda fun to watch them slowly turn matte. Lasts awhile, too- even through some dish washing :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that if I put more than one coat of this on my nails, the polish begins to crack or develop fissures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last very long, either - but I still like it.</li>
    <li> Well suited for bright saturated colors</li>
