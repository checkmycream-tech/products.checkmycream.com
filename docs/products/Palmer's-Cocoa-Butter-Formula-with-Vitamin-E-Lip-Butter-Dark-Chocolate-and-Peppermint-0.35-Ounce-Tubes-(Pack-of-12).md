    <li> My favorite lip gloss!</li>
    <li> Wife only uses this kind of lip product, and she loves it.  Glad I was able to buy in bulk from Amazon. Thanks Amazon :)</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this to me, and we were unable to find it locally.  It makes my lips feel really good - and it smells great.</li>
    <li> This product is amazaing.  My family uses it daily. This lip butter has a pleasant smell and moisturizes very nicely.</li>
    <li> Yummy &amp; hydrating.  If you wear a light coat, it isn&#x27;t shiny...which is good because I gave one to my husband.  He thought I was nuts when I handed him what looked like &amp;#34;lip gloss&amp;#34;.  LOL...I convinced him to put on a very light coat &amp; he liked it.  😜</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite lip stuff. It&#x27;s hard to find in her area, so this 12pk is perfect for gift-giving.</li>
    <li> Have used this forever, but was having a hard time finding it locally.  Checked Amazon and have gotten it twice from them.  You get 12 in an order, so it lasts awhile.  I really think I&#x27;m addicted to it!</li>
    <li> I love this lip butter is feels so good on your lips!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip treatment. I do not like waxy fruity sticks. This is so smooth and the chocolatey, minty aroma is like heaven. Giving lips a slight shine, it works fine alone or with your favorite gloss or lipstick. My lips are eternally grateful I found Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E, Lip Butter, Dark Chocolate and Peppermint on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Can&#x27;t seem to find it locally, but thanks Amazon for having it!  Leaves my lips so soft and does not cause them to peel like other brands do.  I love it and will buy more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry/cracked/peeling lips for years (secondary to untreated celiac disease? Sensitivity to lipstick dyes? Gluten sensitivity? Dry mouth?)&lt;br /&gt;-- this is the ONLY product that works to end the crack/peel/pain  cycle. Smooth lips are a GOOD thing.&lt;br /&gt;I keep losing them from my pockets, so I bought the 12-pack.</li>
    <li> I love Palmers lip butter I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years and its the only thing I use know.</li>
    <li> Makes your lips feel amazing &amp;&amp; smells like hot cocoa ! I&#x27;ve been searching for this stuff for years</li>
    <li> love the price and product:)</li>
    <li> I love this lip gloss and they stopped selling it at my local drugstores. I was so excited to find this pack on Amazon. This pack allowed me to share this gloss with my sisters and friends. The dark chocolate smell and peppermint tingle feel and smell great in the lips. The gloss is easy to smooth on your lips. I like to wear this over lipstick and/or by itself.</li>
    <li> This my favorite, the stores seem like they have stopped selling it. I love getting 12 for this great price. It doesn&#x27;t get sticky, its actually smooth like butter.... Awesome awesome product</li>
    <li> I first bought this at a local drugstore.  Then they stopped carrying it.  I went online and found it on Amazon.  I ordered a set of 12, because with shipping costs it made the most sense to do so.  I was also afraid maybe it had been completely discontinued and I should stock up until I find a new favorite.  Well, when it arrived I opened it up and looked it over to compare with my old tube.  This new one I ordered has the added ingredient of saccharin.  I am not thrilled about this.  It does NOT really make it taste any sweeter (it never had much taste to me, just a wonderful chocolatey smell), and I typically try to always avoid artificial sweeteners, especially saccharin.  (sigh)  Still, it seems to work the same, which is to say GREAT, on keeping my lips soft and happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not able to find this product anywhere in my area.  The flavor is delicious and makes my lips feel great.  I like to have a tube of lip stuff in every purse, in my car, and almost every room in the house, So being able to purchase this item in a box of 12 works perfectly for me and is completely worth it.  The peppermint also makes my lips tingle slightly which is great in the warm summer months.</li>
    <li> Found this while searching for a non beeswax alternative, after discovering I am allergic. I bought the 12 pack and keep them everywhere.</li>
    <li> This leaves your lips looking not too glossy and very smooth.  It has the perfect shine and also smells really nice.  A worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> It is the best lipgloss ever! I ordered a case because it is addictive. Smells like chocolate but feels like mint.</li>
    <li> I started buying this 4 yrs ago at CVS and then all of the sudden it became a scavenger hunt. I had given up hope and then it dawned on me to try Amazon. Same quality, better price, happy lips.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used and I have tried alot of them !!!! Now unable to find it in stores !!!!!</li>
    <li> OMG!! This is the best product for anyones&#x27; lips.  I&#x27;m very upset it is not sold in stores and when I do find it, its usually aneedle in a hay stack.  I&#x27;m glad amazon has it as a 12 pk.  It goes great with any lipstick, too sticky lip gloss, and is amazing by itself.  Keeps your lips smooth and gorgeous. Believe me I know! Once I started using this product nothing else was good enough!</li>
