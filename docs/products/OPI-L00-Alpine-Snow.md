      <li>and I love the way it looks with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I love love love OPI&#x27;s Alpine Snow.</li>
      <li>so you have to be confident and just do it.</li>
      <li>The color is a nice brilliant white..</li>
      <li>I find it to be the best white polish out there on the market.</li>
      <li>LOVE this</li>
      <li>One coat gives adequate coverage for something like that and in two medium coats you have a nice opaque, perfectly self-leveling, white polish.</li>
      <li>work better with a strong top coat.</li>
      <li>Excellent Purchase;  Has Lasted For a Long Time</li>
      <li>This color is amazing and well worth the price I paid for it.</li>
      <li>So quick and easy!</li>
      <li>Great for French manicure or to put designs on top of.  </li>
      <li>great item, love opi, names speaks for itself works great for french manicures and lasts as long as the salon version</li>
      <li>This is a great color for french manicure!</li>
      <li>This is the right thing because it is solid color by not so transparency which is good!</li>
      <li>You only need two coats which is the amount that my daughter already uses for all of her polish, so she was satisfied and will definitely consider getting more OPI nail polishes :) Also, the nail polish brush is a good size that can easily paint/cover all of your nails.</li>
      <li>this opacity is good, however if you only put it in with a  top coat it&#x27;s going to peel, I had to reapply mine once a day in order to keep it looking good, also takes forever to dry</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it two ways so far and love it!</li>
      <li>I get a full 3 weeks from 2 coats of this polish.</li>
      <li>I will say I ALWAYS google the color, brand (OPI) and \\&quot;swatch\\&quot; to see the true color on nails.</li>
      <li>yet they manufacture it with a full size brush.  </li>
      <li>it seems you have to apply three coats before you get full coverage.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good polish production to make french nails myself.</li>
      <li>pretty easy to use.</li>
      <li>She was concerned at first about the streakiness of the Alpine Snow, but it turned out to be just fine.</li>
      <li>how quickly it arrived  </li>
      <li>Also very pretty if you prefer matte color over sparkle or glitter, like I do.  </li>
      <li>No streaking and if you add NYC&#x27;s extra shinny top coat its immaculate!</li>
      <li>It is perfectly light, clean and sets nicely against my dark skin.  </li>
      <li>I have completely opaque nails in 3 coats btw:)</li>
      <li>This white is nice and opaque.</li>
      <li>so it takes a couple of coats to make it look right.</li>
      <li>OPI did it right with this one.</li>
      <li>It has a great consistency and isn&#x27;t a white that will take multiple coats to show color.</li>
      <li>Its application is very smooth only needs two coats.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very unusual color for nails</li>
      <li>OPI L00 Alpine Snow is a very beauiful white I use it when I am getting a  french manicure, but it looks great just on.  </li>
      <li>and of course my first choice was OPI.</li>
      <li>It seems like Alpine Snow is used in so many of my manis, I had to purchase a second bottle!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly what i wanted and as displayed in the picture</li>
      <li>i love the OPI for my french tips.</li>
      <li>Love this brand, will continue to use in the future.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for a French Manicure on my toes and just LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>The color was exactly the one I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>was cute for a fourth of July pattern.</li>
      <li>Goes on thick, but looks great.</li>
      <li>It is a bright white though: not chalky, but definitely not a softer shade which is what I am on the hunt for.</li>
      <li>The shipping was pretty fast the bottle came in tact.</li>
      <li>New favorite white!</li>
      <li>I dont really see they hype in opi polishes.</li>
      <li>I really like the OPI brand.  </li>
      <li>Very watery but hopefully in time it will thicken</li>
      <li>You still need 2 coats to make it absolutely spotless ans streakless, but I sometimes just get away with one coat.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a new white!</li>
      <li>But you have to patient and make sure polish is dry between each coat!!!</li>
      <li>I was able to wear it for a week and a half with no sign of wear and</li>
      <li>My new signature color is the full white pedi with this color.  </li>
      <li>and I have no complaint with the wear.  </li>
      <li>I have found that with OPI you better like the color because it will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comment on how long it lasts itself since I add so many different layers to my manicures.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard finding a good white that isn&#x27;t streaky, that goes on evenly.</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it is primarily used for doing French Manicures</li>
      <li>I use it for nail art mostly but for the whole nail, it&#x27;s thick and it streaks</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent color and coverage!!! AAA+++!!!</li>
    <li> I swear by this white nail polish. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t streak. It&#x27;s completely opaque in two coats and lasts wonderfully. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> great item, love opi, names speaks for itself works great for french manicures and lasts as long as the salon version</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of Sally Hansen&#x27;s \\&quot;White Out\\&quot; before I got ahold of this. It has a great consistency and isn&#x27;t a white that will take multiple coats to show color. It works well in water marbling and dotting designs. I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a new white!</li>
    <li> The shipping was pretty fast the bottle came in tact. However, this may be a fake nail polish. It doesn&#x27;t have the OPI imprint on the inside of the polish stem. This could explain why the color is streaky and not as opaque as the swatches I&#x27;ve seen online.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a long lasting white nail polish for my summer shades. OPI did a great job with this color! It is long lasting, a little clumpy after a few uses but nothing that a little nail polish remover can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> love it. was cute for a fourth of July pattern.</li>
    <li> Perfectly white and long lasting polish. I was able to wear it for a week and a half with no sign of wear and i type  all day.</li>
    <li> Never can go wrong with OPI nail polish and the cheap price is attractive but by the somewhat lengthy time and the price of shipping (which is outrageous for a bottle of nail polish) you might as well just run to the nearest store and pick it up.  Never again!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a French Manicure on my toes and just LOVE it.  OPI is one of the best polishes I have ever used for longevitiy.</li>
    <li> Always pleased with OPI</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pinker than I thought.</li>
    <li> OPI great nail polish!  Love this brand, will continue to use in the future.  This is a great color for french manicure!</li>
    <li> this opacity is good, however if you only put it in with a  top coat it&#x27;s going to peel, I had to reapply mine once a day in order to keep it looking good, also takes forever to dry</li>
    <li> Awesome color! Good deal.</li>
    <li> This white is nice and opaque. You still need 2 coats to make it absolutely spotless ans streakless, but I sometimes just get away with one coat. Perfect polish and base for nail art.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this color several times.  It works great as a base to stamp on or as a stamping color.  I have also worn it on my toes as a solo color.  LOVE this</li>
    <li> As with ALL white polishes, yes it is a difficult formula..... But you have to patient and make sure polish is dry between each coat!!! I have completely opaque nails in 3 coats btw:) i recommend, this is the only white polish i use</li>
    <li> Very white pearly color, definitely does not look so white that it looks like you painted your nails with white out. Also very pretty if you prefer matte color over sparkle or glitter, like I do.  OPI is the best nail color brand.</li>
    <li> This polish is on the thicker side so it applies evenly and doesn&#x27;t need too many coats. I use this as a base coat and for multiple color layering and it makes even the thinnest paints vibrant with just one coat. A must have if you do your own nails and want to step up your game.</li>
    <li> Its a little thin compared to other OPI polishes.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s hard finding a good white that isn&#x27;t streaky, that goes on evenly. OPI did it right with this one. I love this white and use it mostly as a base for art. One coat gives adequate coverage for something like that and in two medium coats you have a nice opaque, perfectly self-leveling, white polish. I&#x27;ve had to go through a few whites to find one that I like and this is the one for me!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite plain white nail polish.  It is the only white I will wear now.  It applies evenly and doesn&#x27;t streak and makes a great base to any white manicure!</li>
    <li> I love the opaque color, it is a thick consistency, but after a few months it got thick and clumpy.</li>
    <li> I had this color in a box set and, I&#x27;m not going to lie, it was the last one I used. At one point I though okay ill try it. I put it on my thumb and though &amp;#34;it looks like whiteout!&amp;#34; And I took it off immediately. But one day I just went for it and painted all my nails with this color. It took me several days to get used to looking at it on my hands. However, after a few days it really started to grow on me. I was getting lots of compliments on it from cashiers at restaurants and strangers. I normally go for dark colors so this was really out of my comfort zone. You should definitely try it. It&#x27;s a very unusual color for nails so you have to be confident and just do it.</li>
    <li> This color is a nice and rich! Its application is very smooth only needs two coats. No streaking and if you add NYC&#x27;s extra shinny top coat its immaculate! One of my favorit polishes!</li>
    <li> pretty easy to use. the complaints about the formula almost warded me away. every white polish has an odd inconsistency, so do many pastels. it&#x27;s something you have to deal with if you want to do your own nails. you just have to learn to work with it. the polish dried quickly and  only had to use 2 coats. it looked great. It is a bright white though: not chalky, but definitely not a softer shade which is what I am on the hunt for.</li>
    <li> The quality is not as good as the ones I bike in store, sorry</li>
    <li> Pretty Good base but chips.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for nail art only.&lt;br /&gt;May work better with a strong top coat.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome white nail polish. It can be used for french manicures or just a white manicure.  Two coats are needed for total coverage.  I love OPI polishes and this one is great!</li>
    <li> Brush is a little thick for applying the French tip look, but I made it work! Goes on thick, but looks great.</li>
    <li> **I orders this item on September 21st 2012 and it came yesterday**&lt;br /&gt;When my bottle came in the mail, it was not wrapped, it had leaked all over the place, and when I opened the bottle, it had no brush and the polish was completely empty! That is just messed up! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item!!!!</li>
    <li> i love the OPI for my french tips. this brand seems to last much longer than any other i&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I was looking for a white nail polish to possibly replace a cheaper brand version that I currently have and of course my first choice was OPI. This color is amazing and well worth the price I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Great for French manicure or to put designs on top of.  I&#x27;ve used it two ways so far and love it!</li>
    <li> I love OPI polish but I couldn&#x27;t find this color in any stores.  I have found that with OPI you better like the color because it will last a long time.  The online shopping was a great experience because you can find so many things at Amazon.  I like that the nail polish came in a small bubble wrap envelope instead of big box with lots of packing.</li>
    <li> A great white that I use frequently as a base to make some colors really pop. I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t get a fake! I can&#x27;t comment on how long it lasts itself since I add so many different layers to my manicures. But I can definitely say that it serves its purpose very well and that&#x27;s all I can ask for!</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely. Not as thick as a lot of polishes so it makes it a lot easier to use for a French Manucure.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a polish that I thought was white, but this one actually is white and I love the way it looks with my skin tone. Will need another bottle soon because I use it constantly</li>
    <li> I really like this white.  First white I&#x27;ve ever had that isn&#x27;t see through after two coats.  Other whites it seems you have to apply three coats before you get full coverage.</li>
    <li> Timeless OPI color. 2 coats for opacity.</li>
    <li> The color is so bright and it lasts. It also dries fast which is a must have for an impatient person like me.</li>
    <li> I love this color.  A perfect matte white.  I use it for my pedi&#x27;s. My new signature color is the full white pedi with this color.  It is perfectly light, clean and sets nicely against my dark skin.  I take it to the salon, so I haven&#x27;t actually used it personally, but the salon seems to have no problem applying it on me....and I have no complaint with the wear.  I get a full 3 weeks from 2 coats of this polish.</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish, so i figured this would be a great product. It wasn&#x27;t. It wasn&#x27;t awful, but considering I&#x27;m paying more money, i expected better quality like the rest of my OPI nail polish. This wasn&#x27;t any better than my $1 wet n wild white, and i think I&#x27;d even prefer that. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> This is a good nail polish. It doesn&#x27;t get old and clump up in the bottle like other polishes that I have tried.  The cost is less also.</li>
    <li> Excellent Purchase;  Has Lasted For a Long Time</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this nail polish! She was concerned at first about the streakiness of the Alpine Snow, but it turned out to be just fine. You only need two coats which is the amount that my daughter already uses for all of her polish, so she was satisfied and will definitely consider getting more OPI nail polishes :) Also, the nail polish brush is a good size that can easily paint/cover all of your nails. OPI rocks!</li>
    <li> I love love love OPI&#x27;s Alpine Snow. I find it to be the best white polish out there on the market. It does get a bit think as you get half way thru the bottle but a little bit of nail polish thinner and your back on your way</li>
    <li> I was searching for a white polish to use as an undercoat for other polishes that needed a little help. This does just that. It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of this color (I&#x27;m a bit sloppy) but once I did it has done the job nicely. It does tend to look like white out so for me it will stay an undercoat polish. I did receive this polish early and it was well protected with bubble wrap. I would recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Second purchase of this color.  Love OPI.  I do alot of nail artwork and this color makes a good base color.</li>
    <li> Very very runny, takes too long for it to dry as well. I dont really see they hype in opi polishes.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery! Thank you</li>
    <li> I really like the OPI brand.  It is great.</li>
    <li> New favorite white! Applies wonderfully!</li>
    <li> The color was exactly the one I was looking for.  Wear it during Christmas.  I looked at local stores for this color and couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
    <li> Very watery but hopefully in time it will thicken</li>
    <li> So quick and easy! Thank you!</li>
    <li> After 2-3 coats your nails are perfectly white. I haven&#x27;t had much experience with white nail polishes though but I like this one.</li>
    <li> I think that this stuff is for the ends of the nails on French manicures. I used it as a base for some purple polish, and it was ok, but if you want a serious layer, get some white with a bit of pink in it; this is almost all &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; material.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a typical white and reasonably priced nail polish. This one works great. It has a bit more of a matte look than a shine, but can&#x27;t complain about that!</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible. The color is a nice brilliant white..just what I wanted, but what difference does that make if the polish chips away? This is the worst polish I have for chipping, base coat, two thin coats, top coat to seal...never fails to disappoint. I wanted a white polish to use a base under neon, and pale colors to get the true color of the top polish. Having this on always makes the polish chip away. Its utterly maddening. Never again. Tonight was a bad night for this polish..it finally went in the trashcan where I shouldve sent it two months ago.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever find my holy grail of white polishes.  The Alpine Snow isn&#x27;t bad.  I use it for nail art mostly but for the whole nail, it&#x27;s thick and it streaks so it takes a couple of coats to make it look right.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this OPI color although I have to say I am rarely displeased with any OPI. I have tried several different bran of polish as I get a manicure every 7-10 days and OPI stands up to the rest. I will say I ALWAYS google the color, brand (OPI) and \\&quot;swatch\\&quot; to see the true color on nails. It can be hard to tell in bottle and unfortunately the OPI swatches on the website are almost never close. I always purchase from XPRESSURSELF, I have NEVER had a problem. Quick ship, fair prices, and he combines shipping. This is a BIG plus for me since I tend to hold off and buy 3-5 different colors at a time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful easy to apply nail polish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the OPI brand of nail polish.  I have been unable to find this particular color in stores for some time.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it is primarily used for doing French Manicures yet they manufacture it with a full size brush.  I saved a thin brush from another brand to help make this item more practical to use.  It would be great if OPI manufactured separately for sale a thin brush in their universal cap so that, if preferred, it could be permanently screwed onto their Alpine Snow Nail Lacquer in lieu of the standard brush.  This color works well with OPI Passion or Bubble Bath for a natural french manicure.</li>
    <li> OPI L00 Alpine Snow is a very beauiful white I use it when I am getting a  french manicure, but it looks great just on.  It&#x27;s something soft and professional for work.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good polish production to make french nails myself. This is the right thing because it is solid color by not so transparency which is good! but I still need 2 layers anyway.</li>
    <li> i was lookin for this paticular color an brand online  when i found it here at amazon i was overjoyed at the price an how quickly it arrived  it&#x27;s exactly what i wanted and as displayed in the picture</li>
    <li> It seems like Alpine Snow is used in so many of my manis, I had to purchase a second bottle! It really does have a lot of versatile uses - alone, french tips, under color, alternating colors, and so on. I&#x27;d say the only things to watch for is it does take 2-3 applications as it does appear streaky when wet (evens when dry) and make sure there are no bumpy cuticles or other on the nail bed as it does pick up all imperfections rather clearly.</li>
