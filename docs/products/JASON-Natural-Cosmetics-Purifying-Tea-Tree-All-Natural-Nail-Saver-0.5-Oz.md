      <li>This smells very good</li>
      <li>I purchased this product based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and I am very pleased!  </li>
      <li>This nail saver is great to heal fungus of the nail.  </li>
      <li>I also choose to ditch the nail polish and my nails look great.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a great nail massage oil</li>
      <li>Ordered arrived in good condition and delivered as  promised on time.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Tea Tree Oil has been known to  help with these kind of problems as to feet and nails.  </li>
      <li>It works wonderful, the color turned normal and my nail began to grow.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking to keep your nails healthy and fungus free, this is a great product to use.</li>
      <li>and I have been using it for more than one month.  </li>
      <li>look healthy.  </li>
      <li>I am now putting it on all my toenails to keep them fungus free and looking better.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;It works great, didn&#x27;t completely heal the fungus.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Patience is required to see fungus free toenails.</li>
      <li>After I started using natural product for my nail, they are growing nice and strong.</li>
      <li>I am not disappointed in this product at all.</li>
      <li>A great (quick and easy) coating to apply to the toenails, daily or twice a day, to prevent or calm and an existing fungal toenail condition.</li>
      <li>Now, after two months of use - twice a day - I can honestly say I&#x27;m seeing a marked improvement in the look of my nails.</li>
      <li>It smells like tea tree oil, but is not super strong smelling; good stuff.</li>
      <li>Helps keep your nails nice and white and helps them grow, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>But as of right now, my opinion is that Jason Purifying Tea Tree</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll go back to the other product, but will use Jason&#x27;s until it is gone to make sure I give it a fair shot.</li>
      <li>It took a month or more but totally cleared up the fungus.</li>
      <li>My nails are improving, but I thinks it&#x27;s mostly because they are simply growing out.  </li>
      <li>I used this product in combination with perioxide, 2x or more daily</li>
      <li>So I really don&#x27;t know if this product is worth the money or not.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice and is great for a nail massage, and it does lessen the appearance of ugly nails because the nails are moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Then you notice it&#x27;s absorbing in instead of hardening</li>
      <li>It is not a typical nail polish that dries into a permanent clear coat or top coat that you have to take off later with nail polish remover.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>All Natural Nail Saver doesn&#x27;t appear to do much of anything.</li>
      <li>The nail is slowly growing out, and the new growth is healthy, although I don&#x27;t know which of the products that I have been using is responsible.  </li>
      <li>When this first goes on, you&#x27;d think it is regular nail polish.  </li>
      <li>It works after only two weeks of use, and the odor is less strong than pure tea tree oil.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because it indicated it would clear up nail fungus.  </li>
      <li>These two products had almost cleared up the problem, but I thought that by using this tea tree oil on the nail a couple of times a day, in conjunction with the vinegar and Vick&#x27;s, the nail might clear up quicker.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this as something to use at least weekly or more if you&#x27;re a habitual nail painter.</li>
      <li>and my toenails are almost back to normal.  </li>
      <li>My nails are almost back to normal</li>
      <li>Really helps fight nail fungus and dry nails.</li>
      <li>I basically went bare foot when I was at home, and put it on my toenail every time I walked into the bathroom.</li>
      <li>I cannot put sunflower oil on my skin, due to the intense itching reaction I have to it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this based on other reviews, and for the reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend using this product for dark spot on nails.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this product does work if you see the start of fungus, it did for me and also did a good job of containing the fungus that was quite bad, but didn&#x27;t allow it to get worse.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this product in combination with perioxide, 2x or more daily and it got rid of black toenail fungus. I basically went bare foot when I was at home, and put it on my toenail every time I walked into the bathroom. It took a month or more but totally cleared up the fungus. I gave it 4 stars b/c no product is perfect</li>
    <li> I struggled with toe nail fungus for years - it would become aggravated by wearing nail polish.  After trying tea tree oil alone, I could sometimes get it somewhat under control, but it was a long process.  Jason&#x27;s Nail Saver is not pure tea tree oil- but it is a CURE for nail fungus.  It works after only two weeks of use, and the odor is less strong than pure tea tree oil.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ordered arrived in good condition and delivered as  promised on time. Have used Jason&#x27;s since my purchase and it has helped the appearance of my toenail as a  result of a fungus. Tea Tree Oil has been known to  help with these kind of problems as to feet and nails.  Hopefully with continued use, 2 x a day my nail will  be back to 100% improvement.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on other reviews, and for the reasonable price. I am not disappointed in this product at all. Just disapppinted that my awful toenails grow so slowly and I can&#x27;t see instant results. But I can tell the product is working because I do see some results overall. Patience is required to see fungus free toenails.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and I am very pleased!  My toenails were cracked due to excessive nail polish wear so I removed all polish and have been putting Tea Tree Oil on my nails for the past month.  My nails are almost back to normal and I believe it is because of the oil!</li>
    <li> Really helps fight nail fungus and dry nails.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of Jason Tea Tree Nail Saver I have purchased and it lasts a long time.  It instantly moisturizes my nails and cuticles and my nails look healthy.  It smells like tea tree oil, but is not super strong smelling; good stuff.</li>
    <li> I had been searching the Internet for a possible treatment of toenail fungus without having to take oral medication.  When I read the information and reviews for this product I was skeptically anxious to give it a try. Now, after two months of use - twice a day - I can honestly say I&#x27;m seeing a marked improvement in the look of my nails. The toenail that was the worst is showing signs of new (fungus free) growth. I am now putting it on all my toenails to keep them fungus free and looking better.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It works great, didn&#x27;t completely heal the fungus.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning to all, if your fungus goes all the way to your cuticle your only cure will be Iodine pills or surgery (trust me from experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product does work if you see the start of fungus, it did for me and also did a good job of containing the fungus that was quite bad, but didn&#x27;t allow it to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cures some, but not all~</li>
    <li> A great (quick and easy) coating to apply to the toenails, daily or twice a day, to prevent or calm and an existing fungal toenail condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what this product is supposed to do.  I bought it because it indicated it would clear up nail fungus.  I had been using a combination of white vinegar and Vick&#x27;s on a toenail that had a fungal infection.  These two products had almost cleared up the problem, but I thought that by using this tea tree oil on the nail a couple of times a day, in conjunction with the vinegar and Vick&#x27;s, the nail might clear up quicker.  This has not been the case and I have been using it for more than one month.  The nail is slowly growing out, and the new growth is healthy, although I don&#x27;t know which of the products that I have been using is responsible.  So I really don&#x27;t know if this product is worth the money or not.  I will try it for a couple of weeks on my fingernails to see if I can notice any difference.  But as of right now, my opinion is that Jason Purifying Tea Tree All Natural Nail Saver doesn&#x27;t appear to do much of anything.</li>
    <li> I had a questionable pedicure, but I have used this in the past for my fingernails. I would recommend this as something to use at least weekly or more if you&#x27;re a habitual nail painter. Nails need some nourishment too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking that it was 100% tea tree oil. Once it arrived, I used it at least twice a day for 4 days on my big toenails. I noticed a small amount of itching on the second day, but didn&#x27;t give it much thought, since it&#x27;s mosquito season. After the fourth day, it became obvious that it was an allergic reaction to the product. At that point, I read the label and discovered that it contained safflower oil. I cannot put sunflower oil on my skin, due to the intense itching reaction I have to it. A little research indicated that safflower oil can cause the same reaction. So, nearly $8 have gone down the drain and the cost of a visit to the doctor. The skin around my big toenails looks like I rubbed it with poison ivy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson: read the label.</li>
    <li> My toenails were yellow and cloudy from leaving polish on too long and from smoothing them and destroying the layers.  I was so embarrassed and kept polish on to cover the ugliness.  I bought Jason&#x27;s because it wasn&#x27;t expensive and haven&#x27;t worn polish all summer.  It smells nice and is great for a nail massage, and it does lessen the appearance of ugly nails because the nails are moisturized.  My nails are improving, but I thinks it&#x27;s mostly because they are simply growing out.  I can&#x27;t attest this product is the sole reason.  I&#x27;m also using it on my fingernails because I have ridges, but it&#x27;s not doing anything.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Helps keep your nails nice and white and helps them grow, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a year now and seen no results.  I thought maybe it would take a long time to actually work, but alas,  it did not.</li>
    <li> I thought i bruised my toe nail running and continually covered it with nail polish.  While removing the nail polish I found my nail was brittle and bumpy along with the dark spot.  I used Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil nail saver along with a cotton ball of peroxide and the next day the dark sport was gone and my nail felt moisturized and a little smoother. I would highly recommend using this product for dark spot on nails.</li>
    <li> When you apply this to your nails it leaves a shiny, moisturizing coat that absorbs into the nail in about 10 minutes.  You can apply it to your cuticles too.  It is not a typical nail polish that dries into a permanent clear coat or top coat that you have to take off later with nail polish remover.  Also, it&#x27;s not like some cuticle oils I&#x27;ve used that are like dipping your hand in olive oil.  When this first goes on, you&#x27;d think it is regular nail polish.  Then you notice it&#x27;s absorbing in instead of hardening up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bring this with me to the nail salon when I get pedicures and ask them to put it on in lieu of regular polish.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help repair damaged toenails from bad pedicures.  I started using this and within 2 days I could see a difference!  I&#x27;ve keep using it at least once a day for the last three weeks and my toenails are almost back to normal.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> I used this product on a severely damaged fingernail.  Now you can&#x27;t even tell anything was wrong with it.  Also am using on my discolored toenails.  It&#x27;s a terrific product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Whole Foods - another step in my many year search to heal my peeling ugly nails. My nails when from peeling, thin and week to strong and long. I mean razor sharp and they grow fast when using this product! I actually have to CUT THEM! I also choose to ditch the nail polish and my nails look great. (I had switch to organic polish &amp; remover for several months before truing this product). Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried Jason&#x27;s for month now, after using a different product for quite a while.  My nails seem to have gotten worse instead of the continuing improvement they were showing.  I&#x27;ll go back to the other product, but will use Jason&#x27;s until it is gone to make sure I give it a fair shot.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when my toenail became discolored from working in wet dirt, probably that fungus. It works wonderful, the color turned normal and my nail began to grow. It does not happen overnight, but within a short time. In the beginning I applied it morning and night at the base of the nail and under the affected nail. Later, as maintenance after everything was cleared up, I use a couple times a week. It also helps my fingernails be stronger-no splitting and peeling.</li>
    <li> i bought this in Feb/March for one toenail and i can&#x27;t even tell if it&#x27;s working.  the stuff wicks onto the surrounding skin and makes it itch/rashy.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to keep your nails healthy and fungus free, this is a great product to use. It&#x27;s easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This nail saver is great to heal fungus of the nail.  It cleared up my infection in a couple of months (I had the fungal infection for 3 or 4 years).</li>
    <li> After I started using natural product for my nail, they are growing nice and strong. This smells very good and it&#x27;s a great nail massage oil</li>
