<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter will love this..great buy!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Lasted 1 month and the light died</li>
    <li> Very nice makeup mirror. True to description. Not to big, not to small. Package well when it came. I bought a Conair, then returned it as it was to big for my table.</li>
    <li> This mirror is definitely not worth the purchase.  All the lighting selections are NOT complimentary whatsoever or true to light - they all gave off a very sickly glow.  One of the reasons for purchasing the mirror was because of the 5x magnification, and while it did magnify, it also gave a &amp;#34;fish eye&amp;#34; image - not an accurate reflection at all.  Very disappointed in this mirror and a waste of money...sorry to say.</li>
    <li> Awesome my daughter loves iy&amp;ugrave;</li>
    <li> Could not find one of these in the store, so finally found on Amazon.  Have had these in the past and when we remodeled the master bath in the old house, didn&#x27;t need it any more.  But we moved and this is a better solution that remodeling the bathroom!  Works great and well packaged.  Much superior than the round, lighted mirrors at Target, Walmart, etc.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Still decided to take a chance on buying this after reading a lot of negativity in people&#x27;s reviews. I turned it on for 3-5 minutes each morning for maybe 3 mornings before it broke - lights stayed off, burnt hair smell coming out of it, etc. Got a prompt exchange from Amazon (which arrived the first couple days of August) and I haven&#x27;t had trouble with it yet, so that&#x27;s almost 3 months now, yay! It&#x27;s not perfect, but good enough for the money. The slider to select which type of lighting you want is a little crooked and you can still see the edges of the other colors that you don&#x27;t have selected. Sometimes I wish I could stand it up a  little straighter, but it isn&#x27;t a major problem. Good for the money if you can get a working one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;OMG, the day after I posted this review I turned it on and the lights made a noise and went out! Less than 3 months and it&#x27;s broken again :(  Totally never buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror for the way it magnified and the 4 light settings.  However after having the mirror for 5-6 weeks it caught on fire.  It started sparking, smoking and hissy one morning while applying my makeup.  Thankfully Amazon made an exception to their 30 day return policy and granted me a full refund....Thank you Amazon.com for being customer friendly.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.  Have not had any probems with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in August 2012.  Shortly after, it quit working.  The lights started working again after a few days.  It just quit completely tonight as I heard a pop sound and it&#x27;s dead.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best thing that ever happened to me. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now and I must say I love it. It has perfecting lightening &amp; the mirrors allows to do perfect my makeup with all the different angles it can adjust too. I love it</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this makeup mirror. Flip the switch and the light comes on. Magnifying mirror is great. I can now see the dead gum whiskers on my lip. Hello Nair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my daughter, and it worked great for about 2 weeks and then the lights stopped working.  Before someone says &amp;#34;you have to hold the ON button for 5-10 seconds&amp;#34;, the lights quit working while she was using it.  So, I was sent a replacement mirror.  The replacement mirror was defective...only 2 of the 4 settings could be used and the colors on those 2 settings were not correct.  So they are both going back and we are done with this product.  The mirror itself just seemed very cheap, I really expected a better quality product based on the reviews.  I never leave negative reviews, but had to with this one.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my aging Conair makeup mirror.  Didn&#x27;t like it at all and gave it to my teenage daughter.  The lights aren&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
    <li> bulb caught fire. Just exploded.!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too late to return. Got three months use from the product.</li>
    <li> I had this type of mirror when I was 14 and love this one at age 50-something.  IT&#x27;s a good buy and a great mirror to double check your makeup.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror that has an electric plug port to use hair care items.  My former mirror lasted 30 plus years before the bulbs burned out, and I am hoping that this one will do the same.</li>
    <li> Light seem very true to real light (I set it on office).  I really like the side panel mirrors.  Disadvantage - the mirror has to be on a firm surface to correctly support the stand.  (No resting this one on my lap!)</li>
    <li> Got it for my better half. She loves it. No problems with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas present and the person loves it.  She has used one of these for years (old habits are hard to break).  The price was better than others out there too.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, fast shipping, came brand new, and lights were fine. Very pleased and would recommend!</li>
    <li> A bit too bulky, Not good for travel. I wish the cord was longer. The mirror works fine, I don&#x27;t get the funhouse effect. The lighting is useful. Just wish it was smaller, more compact.</li>
    <li> I was so s&lt;br /&gt;Excited to get this since it had different lighting.  When I looked at the 5x mirror,it looked like a fun house one . After a good laugh I am sending it back for another one .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see as well as I used too so this works good&lt;br /&gt;the magnification is quite clear&lt;br /&gt;the lights are a little spooky</li>
    <li> It has been about 4 months since I&#x27;ve had this and I have had no problem with the lights. This is the perfect mirror for doing my makeup. I love it!</li>
    <li> Much better electrical design than the previous model, particularly the light starting function.  The switch is now simply on/off, with electronic light starting.  Appearance and functionality are excellent.</li>
    <li> Lighting a little off and falls over a little easier than my old mirror. I had a very old Clairol that finally fell apart. Very good light, but this does ok.</li>
    <li> This mirrow didn&#x27;t last long... where do you buy those skinny little bulbs.  The light wasn&#x27;t very good anyway.  I did like the three sided mirrow and the controls were easy to use. I also liked how it flipped over from regular to magnifing. Darn, I did like that mirrow, it&#x27;s just that the lights were just not that good.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very sturdy, although it is the second time purchasing the mirror.  I dropped my last one, but it last about 9 years.</li>
    <li> With a little bit of skill this mirror can be hung up on the wall and works great.  If it is hung up you cannot rotate the center mirror, so decide whether or not you want magnification before you hang it.</li>
    <li> Daughter loving it and uses it every day! Long lasting and great product!</li>
    <li> This completes my fantasies on having my vanity table. I recently purchased a super cute table so I can turn it into my vanity table (not here in Amazon though) and the next on my list was a container for my makeup and I bought this one. The lights really pulled me in too deep. I just had to buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this thing. it has multiple lighting setting, it folds in so that it doesn&#x27;t take up space when you are done, it has that 5X mirror on the back so I can do my lash tabbing. I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it.  I even bought one and gave it as a gift to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror in 2012 and just started using it.  It is missing one little part..the little part that makes it stand up. I turned it upside down, but that is not working either.  I have a habit of buying things and not using right away..this time it cost me big time, because I know it is too late to do anything about it.  Oh well...so if you buy it ...make sure you have the parts for the back that makes it stand up ...In all fairness it does light up and has various settings of light...but not worth much to me. I feel cheated.  Also delivery was very slow..took forever to get it.</li>
    <li> My wife have one jerdon Ligthed Mirror since almost 15 years, and she is very happy with it.. That is why she want to buy a new one</li>
    <li> This is even better than the old Conair. The lighting is amazing, you don&#x27;t wish the mirror was bigger because it&#x27;s already the right size. I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems with this item.</li>
    <li> This mirror does make your skin tone strange colors when used, but it has been great for me! I get a good idea of when my makeup will look like in dif lighting. My coverage has been great since I got this.</li>
    <li> Just ordered this and thought the light is bright enough and the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mirror works well, the magnification mirror is warped oddly and makes it difficult to use effectively.  Am still pondering whether to send it back as I need a make-up mirror and now must look again to find another better one if its out there.</li>
    <li> Very nice, exactly what I wanted, works great.  Gives plenty of light, unlike several others I have used, so you can see exactly what you are doing.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror about a year ago and it is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Well lit.&lt;br /&gt;* Quality product.&lt;br /&gt;* It has a useful magnification mirror that you can flip over to.&lt;br /&gt;* It is large and also 3-sided, so you can really get a good view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Because it is large, I pack it away, and land up not using it much. Not a con if you have a place for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad that I bought this product.</li>
    <li> it could have a more realistic &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; setting. one more &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Everything worked great for about 2 months and then the lights just burned out. I found their website [...] and submit a contact form there asking about 1yr warranty. I got a reply from them after few days later asking about the model number, date code, my address and phone number. I replied them back and they sent me a new mirror w/in a week! They didn&#x27;t even ask me to return the broken mirror - told me to just cut the cord and trash it.  I am pretty happy w/ their customer service.</li>
    <li> I too, read the reviews and almost didn&#x27;t purchase this, I bought the Conair Illunimation and HATED the Conair, returned it and got this Jerdon.  The light is bright, not 4 skimpy bulbs like the conair, I like the on-off switch and the plug is an added plus.  Trust me, I have had a make-up mirror for 40 years and this is is a good buy.  Got the product within a couple of days from Amazon, packed well.  I am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> The tri-fold lighted makeup mirror is perfect for my daughter. I actually have a GE lighted makeup mirror and love it. I assume GE doesn&#x27;t make it anymore, because I couldn&#x27;t find it when I googled. My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Electrical smoke and burnout in less than two weeks</li>
    <li> This is a  nice mirror, but it is actually a bit larger than I expected. It has an adjustable back so that it can be set to sit at different reclining angles, sort of like a lawn chair. The lighting is adjustable, too, but it not quite as bright as I had hoped. It&#x27;s not bad, though.  The middle mirror is also adjustable within it&#x27;s frame. One side is a regular mirror, and on the flip side is the magnifying mirror.  I just with that the outlet cord were a bit longer -- it&#x27;s about 5 feet long. I&#x27;ve been satisfied so far with the mirror for the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning:  I have actually had to purchase 2 of these.  The first one started to burn when I had the lights on for a prolonged period of time.  It smelled like it would catch on fire, so I got rid of it, got another, and now I am careful not to leave the lights on for more than 20 minutes at a time.  It&#x27;s been fine.</li>
    <li> I was setting up the mirror to put on my makeup and the piece that holds the stand up broke off into pieces so now I have to prop the mirror up in order to see into it.  I think the material is very cheap.  This should not have happened.  Now I have to go and research another mirror other than this one!</li>
    <li> When my Clairol True Light Mirror (that I bought in the late 1970&#x27;s) finally broke in 2010, I bought this mirror because it looked a lot like the Clairol one.  I was not disappointed at first.  The light was bright and the 5 mag mirror was perfect - not wavy at all. But after 4 years both lights burned out and they cannot be replaced. There are 4 slits on the back of my mirror, and no tool fits in them. So I ordered a second Jerdon mirror.  It arrived quickly. The light is bright, but the 5 mag mirror is so wavy it hurts my eyes to look at it.  And that is the side of the mirror I have been using lately. I tried to get used to it, but it really hurts my eyes.  It also has the 4 slits in the back, so the bulbs cannot be changed either. So I am returning it. I love the lighting on this mirror, but the 5 mag is fun house worthy!</li>
    <li> I read all the product reviews before I purchased this mirror but couldn&#x27;t believe the negative comments about the lighting could be as bad as some said.  Several said it was fine.  After trying to use mine, I agree that the lighting is horrible.  I am not impressed with the lack of light and still be listed as \\&quot;LIGHTED\\&quot;.  The bulbs create such a small amount of light, regardless of the setting used, that I just don&#x27;t use the light at all.  Very disappointed.  Would rather have light!</li>
    <li> My mother had a make-up mirror that was a Remington and it broke after many years of use, so I purchased this Jerdon lighted mirror and she loves it just like the old Remington.  That is why I give it 5 stars for the product and the service from Amazon free shipping and fast service too!</li>
    <li> It looked new or refurbished. Mount/Stand is flimsy plastic and could break easily so you have to treat this thing like a newborn. I guess they made it that way so you can keep buying more of these products. Could be built more sturdy. But everything works fine. 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This lighted mirror is ok. The lighting is kind of dull and could be better. What I really like best about the lighted mirror is the electrical plug on the front, which is great for plugging in a hair dryer or curling iron.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror very much.  Magnifying part if particularly for putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> I have used Clairol Mirrors a longtime. This is comparable and Works for me&lt;br /&gt;Its was a great bargain too. It arrived only 2 days after I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Great mirror, great price</li>
    <li> I was concerned about all of the negative reviews when I bought this, but it had all the features I wanted, so I gave it a try anyway. I am glad I did. I have had this mirror for nearly 2 years and use it at least twice a day.  I have had absolutely no problems with it at all and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a Christmas gift.  Worked well initially then bulbs began to flicker, now will not work at all.  Unable to find replacement bulbs and one web site reports that these bulbs are no longer available and when they were available it required an electrical professional to change the bulbs..  Guess I&#x27;ll eat the cost of this purchase.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Had I known this short life of the bulbs and the unavailablity I would have never bought it.</li>
    <li> Used the make up mirror for 2 weeks and the bulb exploded.</li>
    <li> A lot of mirror in a small package. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in Oct 2010. By Nov 2011 the lights have blown and are not replaceable. This is a non serviceable item. The lights cannot be replaced.  I threw away nearly $40 on something I expected to last more than one year. Conveniently the warranty is only for one year.  I am very disapointed with this particular product.</li>
    <li> bought this for my girlfriend.....it arrived quickly and she loved it. that night was a very good night...just sayin</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> .I have owned two of the Jerdon mirrors, the first lasted a few years, (bulbs blew out one at a time). \\&quot;Okay\\&quot;, I said, it was worth it.  I purchased another mirror after a few months, the bulbs just would not stay on. (switch problem?)&lt;br /&gt; The plus side of these mirrors are the tubular fluorescent lights it houses. They give off a bright setting for applying make-up.&lt;br /&gt;The minus is that they can&#x27;t be replaced and no one should have to become an electrician to attempt to fix this inferior product.  Jerdon will not get a cent out of me again.</li>
    <li> I used to have an 8x magnification round make up mirror, but because it was smaller and round it gave a pretty distorted image, and I couldn&#x27;t see enough of my face at one time.  I decided to give this one a try even though it is only 5x magnification.  I tried this one because the mirror is larger and rectangular so I can see my entire face, and it is far less distorted than the round ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can select lighting based on time of day and / or location by using a simple slide bar.  It also has two side mirrors that you can extend outward to see yourself in profile on the left or profile on the right.  Or simply extend the mirrors for a wider view (in 1x magnification only).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this one again, and I will recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> The light is very dim, even on it&#x27;s brightest. The magnifying mirror is HORRIBLE ...it&#x27;s just a distorted mirror, makes you dizzy to look into it. I&#x27;ll keep it, but not what I expected. I didn&#x27;t rate it &amp;#34;don&#x27;t like&amp;#34; because I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
    <li> Got it yesterday, it is back in its box today ready for return.  I seriously thought I was going to have a seizure when testing the magnification mirror.  It is like looking in a circus fun house mirror, it is so distorted.  Both sides of the mirror have some sort of wavy, distorted view going on and I was nauseous after applying my makeup this morning.  I love my Clairol True To Light that I&#x27;ve nursed along for 20 years.  Since I can&#x27;t buy anything that is as good as that one, I will be lurking on auction sites looking for a used Clairol.  This Jerdon mirror is just not comparable at all.</li>
    <li> After my last mirror died after 30 years, yes 30 years!  I think it was a conair, I searched and searched for a replacement.  The Jerdon looked like close replacement.  I was okay with it, the lighting really wasn&#x27;t that bright but it was better than nothing.  Then only after having it for 2 years, the lights went out and there is no repairing it!  So if you don&#x27;t mind, replacing your mirror every couple of years, go ahead and buy it, otherwise, I&#x27;d look at another one.</li>
    <li> To start let me say that I am a fifteen year old girl, but don&#x27;t let that discourage you from reading my review. I know an awful lot about makeup and I have been using makeup for three years. I am very talented and I know a good makeup-related item when I use it. I had this mirror for a year (I got it as a Christmas gift) and I am here to share my honest opinion of this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other important details I must discuss before I share my thoughts: I used this mirror early in the morning, and kept it in my room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is very useful. I got it as a Christmas gift and I was simply thrilled. As time passed I did find some features which were not up to my standards. First, I found that all the different settings for lighting (for me) were unnecessary, I only used the first setting, it suited the time which I would be wearing my makeup the best. I also found that my mirror liked to fall down from time to time, which I found annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most upsetting feature I found was that the mirror was not very attractive. I had it displayed in my room and it looked very, let&#x27;s say \\&quot;hospital-like\\&quot;, cold and, in a way, unwelcoming. I put stickers on it to make it look more attractive but it still had that harsh feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that the light was too bright for someone who just woke up. The light can hurt your eyes, so be cautious when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did find the mirror very useful for makeup, I could see every nook and cranny of my face and make myself look as attractive as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually the light bulbs inside the mirror died, and I did not know how to change them. As time passed I found the now less-useful mirror to be even more unattractive, and I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use an ordinary wall mirror and I direct a normal desk light at my face. It works just as well and it is far more attractive than that bulky ugly mirror. The only thing I am missing out on is the 5x magnification, but sometimes you&#x27;re better off not getting a more detailed look at your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the mirror is useful, you&#x27;re probably better off just using your bathroom mirror or a mirror and light in your room, far more attractive and with around the same amount of function.etimes you&#x27;re better off not getting a more detailed look at your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the mirror is useful, you&#x27;re probably better off just using your bathroom mirror or a mirror and light in your room, far more attractive and with around the same amount of function.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror based on reviews. And all I can say that it&#x27;s bad. It&#x27;s huge and chunky making it difficult to store away. And the lighting is the worse! It&#x27;s not natural lighting at all, it goes from blue, to green and yellow. not nice :/</li>
    <li> This mirror will stand the test of time. I bought a new one for my sister this year for Christmas. She has been using the one our mother had until she passed away over eight years ago. I don&#x27;t know how old it is, been around a long time and it still works. But there is a big dark blob the size of a quarter smack in the middle of the old center mirror, which she got used to looking around but drove me crazy. So now she has this new one, and I expect she will have it for many years to come. It&#x27;s an excellent product, I hope it lasts as long as the old one.</li>
    <li> The light adjustment doesn&#x27;t work. It is stuck on daylight setting, but I kept the product because that is the setting I use most often.</li>
    <li> You need an electrician to replace the bulbs??  They didn&#x27;t even last a year.  If you want a disposable mirror, this is the one.</li>
    <li> THe magnified side is so warped it makes me dizzy and that&#x27;s the side I really like to use.  Other than that it&#x27;s exactly what I had and needed.</li>
    <li> This is a nice makeup mirror, everything works great.</li>
    <li> Very strange mirror.  It&#x27;s not big enough to have the lights so bright and it literally blinds you.  It has lighting adjustments for day, home, office, etc. and they&#x27;re very inaccurate.  The magnifying side of it...which is the main reason why I ordered it, is concave in the middle making a very limited reflection area.  Not worth the price at all.  Again...just a very strange mirror.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and she liked it very much.</li>
    <li> Before I made the purchase, I read some of the reviews.  Very skeptical about the whole lighting issue but purchased anyway with my fingers crossed.  I have had it for about a month and love it.  You do have to hold the on switch for a couple seconds for it to turn on but it works great so far.  No complaints here.</li>
    <li> After my first one \\&quot;expired\\&quot; after several years, I bought a Conair mirror which was so inferior I immediately ditched it and purchased this model.  It is far superior to any I&#x27;ve used.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to gift this item.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a new lighted mirror.  My old one originally had four bulbs and I was down to one working (not the same brand or style).  My old mirror still puts off more light than this.  And as far as the magnifying side of this mirror, it may magnify as stated but I got so dizzy from the distortion that I had to walk away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> so far the bubble still work. it&#x27;s a good makeup mirror but if it can be a little bigger would be great. I never use 5x mirror on the other side, that make me dizzy, but I really like the mirror on both side. Other cons, the mirror is so light, so it couldn&#x27;t stand firmly. a gental touch could make the mirror turn around.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror a few months ago upon recommendation from a friend. I loved it. The light was nice, the mirrors were a perfect size. Everything was perfect. I am reporting back that after using this device a handful of times for a little over 3 months, I turned it on one day to find that the bulbs were broken. It appears they just shorted out or something. They no longer turn on. Very disappointed by how cheap this mirror is. I will not buy it again, and I would encourage anyone else to purchase a different item. Anything but this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit 4/23/15: updating this to reflect what happened afterward. So I emailed their customer service department to see if i could get a replacement and luckily i was able to! I just had to show them my amazon receipt. The mirror works great now. We&#x27;ll see if it lasts this time.</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews from other buyers and I took a chance at it. For me, I found that this product is great and i am glad that I brought it. Although I dont use it everyday, It serve its purpose. Many had said to have problems with the lights staying on and turning on. It is written on the bottom under the switch that you have to hold the button for a few seconds and the light will come on and stay on. The only thing that I do agree with is when it comes to the lights being changed \\&quot;if ever needed\\&quot; we will need a professional electrician to do it...it cost a bundle just have some one come out and look at it. All In All, I am enjoying my mirror and I&#x27;m hoping that I would not need to have and electrician come and change my \\&quot;lifetime Lights\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The Jerdon mirror was everything I expected.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have purchase other brands of makeup mirrors in the past, but this Jerdon mirror has proved to be the best.  Others lasted (the lighting was always a problem) 6 months or less, the last Jerdon I purchased before this one lasted 2 years, of using it every day.  The only problem was the switch, which I see that Jerdon has improved on this model.  I am very pleased with Jerdon&#x27;s overall quality and performance.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the negative reviews, I almost didn&#x27;t buy this.  But, I threw caution to the wind and plunked down my cash.  Have had the mirror for over a month now.  Use it every morning with the lights.  Have had no problems.</li>
    <li> Well lets see I bought two of these mirrors one for each daughter 1 of them worked fine and that was for my daughter living with me and the other was for the daughter that lives out of town and hers would not even turn on so i contactacted amazon people as soon as I heard it didn&#x27;t work and then by the time i got the package from daughter to send back the credit card wanted their money which i thought was wrong because the thing did not work I think they handle it horrible but the amazon company has stood beside me about the problem today is the 17th of feb. and yesterdday I sent the mirror back so I hope you all get it.</li>
    <li> This is the mirror I&#x27;ve been searching for!  The mirror tilts up and down, not sideways - how does sideways help? The light is bright and the magnification is excellent.  My old eyes can see again.  I love this mirror!</li>
    <li> Ive had this type of mirror before in the past it is normal to have to hold the on button for a total of 3 seconds (do three mississippi&#x27;s) The different types of lighting are great. The magnification side terrific for the eyebrows, makes for flawless makeup application as well. I&#x27;ll take this mirror any day over the bright little round ones u find in the store now. I gave this 4 stars because im not sure i totally agree with the light represented by this mirror, but use your common sense ladies if you open your compact in the office and you look like your in home lighting, use the home light setting when putting on your make up for work :-)</li>
    <li> The different light settings are a nice feature. Some of the time though, the light doesn&#x27;t go on, and I didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d have to have an experienced electrician replace the bulbs once they die, which obviously isn&#x27;t very practical.</li>
    <li> Dispite all of the negative reviews I gleefully purchased this item for my better half. She loves it and when we plugged it into the wall socket turned the on-off switch to the on position the light came on without any hesitation and illumimsted her facial area to the fullest extent so that she could apply her war paint without any use of flashlights.  Though I did not get any green stamps with my purchase I still very highly endorse this product. Buy it and U VILL LIKE IT! Also check out my book &#x27; Test Questions That You Wished Asked in Class&#x27; at Amazon.com &amp; U VILL LIKE IT TOO!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0000AFUT3 Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Forgot how great it was to have one.  This is something I don&#x27;t want to do without again.  If you are looking for a lighted makeup mirror this one was the best for my money.</li>
    <li> I returned this after 2 days of trying it.  The lighting is very unrealistic on all levels!  The worse one - the office setting is BLUE!  I am spoiled I guess, because I had a make up mirror from the late 1960&#x27;s (I think it was by Clairol), and it was fantastic!  I can&#x27;t seem to find anything equivalent.  If the lighting was better I would have kept it because otherwise that quality was not bad.</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_wr_but_top?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;asin&#x3D;B0000AFUT3#&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from singapore, i ordered 3 pieces of the above mirrors and they arrived in very good condition.  i knew from the beginning that i had to get a voltage converter. out of the 3 pieces arrived, only one is working, with the converter i hv prepared in advance. i communicated with Jerdon and they said this product is not meant for other countries other than U.S.A. and Canada.  then i asked why they sold to Singapore, and they said all orders are processed by computer.  now the money i spent in shipping back the 2 faulty units cost me as much as the cost of the 2 units, but at least i dont have to throw away such beautifully designed mirrors which i have been looking for for a long time. so the advice for international purchasers is that, dont buy electricial stuff.....&lt;br /&gt;cecilia from Singapore</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good mirror.  I don&#x27;t like the look of it really, and it sounds like a bug zapper when you turn it on, but it works.</li>
    <li> This mirror has a lever that changes the light setting by colored filters on either side of the mirror that move from office to evening to day, etc.  These did not move in sync and the lever was so hard to move it popped off and scraped my knuckles so bad they bled.  One side would be on one setting and the other would be different.  One side would not move to day at all. I popped the coverings off and moved it myself and decided to just keep it on day.  I used the mirror one time and it was great.  After that, the lights on the mirror would not come on no matter how long I held the button to on.  I think the company that makes this mirror has no quality control and you take your chances when ordering whether you will receive a defective mirror or a mirror that works.  Mine was an just a worthless product that has been a complete and utter disappointment.  I&#x27;ve gotten no help from Amazon other than them saying to return it and the excuse it does not ship from Amazon. I&#x27;ve never returned an item to Amazon and am a Prime member.  I am not a complainer.  This mirror was truly worthless.  It was defective in several ways. I don&#x27;t think a customer should have to take a chance on ordering a defective product.  If Amazon sells it and ships it Prime Amazon should back the product and force the company to improve their quality control. This is not fair to customers.[[ASIN:B0000AFUT3 Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror]]</li>
    <li> This is great product. It&#x27;s solid and has different shades of lights. It&#x27;s easy to tell how you will look in different places (the office,home,daylight and evening.) I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of use.</li>
    <li> Like this lighted makeup mirror a lot!!!! I prefer this &#x27;older style&#x27; lighted mirror. It&#x27;s very bright which is what I was looking for. I bought a &#x27;new style&#x27; round mirror and got rid of it as it is not bright enough. I&#x27;m very happy with this one!!</li>
    <li> My wife has had one of these for many years and the bulbs finally died. I bought a replacement for her. She uses it when we travel and her old one had been from Maine to Florida and from coast to coast. She has always liked the mirror and all of the other types of lighted mirrors she has bought over the years just don&#x27;t so the same job for her.</li>
    <li> The mirror is good for doing hair and some makeup.  The lights are not bright enough for tweezing.  It is large and takes up more room than I thought.  It will be used but still another mirror is needed for closeups.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror and use it almost daily to do my makeup.  The size is great and the illumination is perfect.  It is great to have the magnification for doing eyes or for plucking.  While it is not \\&quot;ugly\\&quot; to look at, I prefer to put it up when not in use to keep my counter clutter free.  I would definitely give one of these as a gift for someone else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for perhaps ten days now and, although it is a bit bigger and dimmer than I had imagined, it appears to be a good product for a reasonable price.  My dressing table has maddeningly low lighting directed at the ceiling (which doesn&#x27;t help much), so this purchase was intended to correct the situation.  It&#x27;s slide mechanism for changing to different lighting situations (day, evening, office, and home) when one may presumably be seen in daylight (less makeup?), low light (more makeup?), beneath fluorescent light (aging), and around incandescent light (more flattering), respectively, and thereby be applying makeup differently, strikes me as rather misguided.  Many of us are using fluorescent lighting throughout our homes these day, and, with the exception of the Day setting, the three other settings aren&#x27;t bright enough to be all that functional (for my aging eyes).  Nonetheless, the Day setting is fine, and it&#x27;s helpful to have the two side mirrors, along with a choice to flip to a magnified mirror when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that some purchasers had an on-off button which they had to hold down for a few seconds in order to get the lights to turn on and stay on... mine has a toggle switch which turns the lights on immediately, so I can&#x27;t comment on their issue with this.  Perhaps Jergon has changed the feature now?  Also, a few people noted that one of their doors would not stay in place.  There, again, mine are tightly hinged and stay where I set them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All inexpensive products (and especially those made of plastic) need to be handled gently, and will last surprisingly long with a little care.  All in all, it was a good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> After searching for a replacement for my dead Revlon lighted magnifying mirror, I read all your reviews listed for this product.  I thought armed with the information from several users about holding the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button a few seconds to get the lights to come on, I would be fine with it.  Ok, so it worked the first 3 times.  Now it tries to light up one light, but not the other, or absolutely nothing.  I try holding the switch down and allow the lights to \\&quot;flicker\\&quot;, but not no sparks!  And it always happens when I am trying to get ready to go out and want to see my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have the packaging, but I am going to return this product for another.  Such a disappointment, and now a hassle as well.</li>
    <li> This unit is just what I have been looking for. The other units you see have bulbs that get HOT these use cooler flourescent bulbs and provide better light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is if you have to replace the bulbs. Otherwise, excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have owned this mirror for almost 5 years and have not had to replace the bulbs yet. I find the 4 different light settings to be very useful and the mirrors themselves are great. The only drawback is that if I sit too close to the mirror, say for detailed eye work, I find that the lights are very hot and my skin gets flushed, which is bothersome but not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great.  I have not experienced any problems with the on/off switch or with the slide that changes the color tone.  The light is bright.  Other makeup mirrors I tried were not bright enough.  Great mirror, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy one.</li>
    <li> It has more light than most brands and the mirror swivels side to side.  Those that swivel top to bottom are useless.</li>
    <li> present for my wife on her birthday. she loves it. especially the choices of lighting. looks to be well made. hope it lasts like the last one....30 years.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described ... so incredibly useful, I use it almost everyday.</li>
    <li> Product appears to have been properly packaged for shipping, and arrived in a timely manner, as advertised.  I am impressed with the combination of lighting and magnificiation that this product offers.  Nice!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  It is just like my old one, only with a different manufacuter name in the bottom right corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my old one for a long time, and I expect that this new one will last just as long.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product that I purchased and would reccomend it to anyone who would have interest in the product.</li>
    <li> this is not a bad product but its not great either.  In this case you get a really good product considering the price.  In all fairness no lighted makeup mirror is ever bright enough for me.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for a 13year old in an effort to help reduce the amount of caked on make up she was putting on and WOW what a difference it has made. We are considering buying one more to keep at her mom&#x27;s house. Great product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0000AFUT3 Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror]]This a great mirror!  It&#x27;s the brightest I&#x27;ve seen without broiling my face.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased the some light.  They have made an improvement in the switch which makes it easier to turn on.  If you need to see what you&#x27;re doing this mirror is for you!</li>
    <li> Have only had it for about a month, but everything works fine.  Don&#x27;t have to hold down the light switch an unusually long time.  Close match to the Clairol mirror I had for so long. Electrical outlet on the front is convenient for using a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she uses it everyday.  She has no complaints so it&#x27;s a winner</li>
    <li> Seems fake compared to the one I previously owned. Wavy, blurry mirror. Lousy.</li>
    <li> Compared to the conventional&#x27;, non-lighted mirrors that I&#x27;ve been using before, this is a significant improvement. And the bad reviews seem to be just the unlucky ones because the lights haven&#x27;t burned out in mine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I was expecting.. I wanted a lit mirror to do my makeup but even with the different light settings the bulbs are just not bright enough. If I stay far away it is okay to do my hair but going up close for makeup my face is in shadow. It is nice so I recommend it if it&#x27;s what you need.</li>
    <li> I should have taken the advice posted here.  After eight months of use, the bulbs flickered, then went dead.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as it appeared on line. Good quality and shopping on line gave me the best price with free shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror really except one thing it tips backwards. I find I have to put a weight on the back of it to keep it from tipping forward.. Other wise its great. It sits on my bathroom cabinet which is flat has no reason to tip.. I also love it because u can travel with it.  I wrap it in a towel and put it in my suitcase it has done well..&lt;br /&gt;  I love that the center mirror moves up and down.</li>
    <li> i like it verry much.  the magnification is great and the price was good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was not satisfied with the lighting on my current make-up mirror.  After much searching for another style mirror, I came across this one.  The style is more like the older ones I used to have and I really liked and used for many years.  Initially after reading the reviews, I was hesitant but after reading  the review by a husband of a woman who purchased this I was sold.  His wife was complaining it was not bright enough, but he told her she just had to hold the on button for a few seconds longer. I followed his lead and did what he said to do and it works. The different shades of lighting are perfect so when I choose office. my make-up looks the same at home as at work.  The magnification is awesome, and there is a convenient plug in for other accessories.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I found this product on Amazon!</li>
    <li> The main magnifier mirror is very warped and  I can not use it at all. The light at its brightest is also not very bright.  Unfortunately I had this sent to my vacation home in Florida and am now here over a month later and now cant return it.  Its past the return time.  I have the Conair one at my other home and its way better!  I do not recommend this mirror at all!  I had to buy a small portable magnifier mirror with a suction cup base and stick it to the mirror.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for one month, but read reviews that were negative and positive.  I have had a very positive experience with this mirror so far.  The light works perfect.  It comes on immediately after pressing the on button.  The magnified mirror is perfect.  As with all magnification mirrors, you do have to get somewhat close, but not too close.  It all depends on your eyes.  For the money, the mirror has alot to offer.  It has many different angles and the side mirrors are a plus for making sure my foundation completely covers the side of my face and that my eyeshadow is not too far over my eyelids (out past the corners).</li>
    <li> I love LOVE this mirror!!&lt;br /&gt;Everything about it is a win-win...from the 4 different light choices, the magnifier on the reverse side, the 3-way mirror effect (one main, two adjustable sides)...I love everything about it!&lt;br /&gt;I can finally put on my makeup without having to wonder if it is too much, not enough, just right?? Since I have started using this mirror I have received so many compliments that I am convinced that a really good mirror is the true secret to applying makeup properly, plucking my eyebrows (using the mag. side), even putting on moisturizer @ night ~ everything one could possibly want a makeup mirror for ~ it is all here!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item; as a matter of fact, I intend to order 7 more, 1 for each of my 6 daughters &amp; my daughter-in-law, for Christmas gifts! More than one of them has already let it be known that they would love to have one like mine!! :)</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time but it was a poor quality item.  We had to return it because the tab used to move the lighting settings came apart the first time we tried it.  Not worth your time; the oveall quality of the material was poor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror a few weeks ago to replace an old one. Mirrors with the adjustable side mirrors are nearly impossible to find in stores. I was happily surprised when I received the mirror to find it was exactly like one I had (and loved) years ago! The product is terrific and the lighting is great. I think some of the best features of this mirror, which are not on every one, are the multiple rear position adjustments and the fact that the side mirrors adjust and stay where you position them. Many I have had in the past had side mirror panels that only opened and couldn&#x27;t be positionally adjusted. This is a great purchase and a great price. I recently saw this product in Sally&#x27;s (for the first time ever) selling for $10.00 more than Amazon&#x27;s price. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of makeup mirrors from different companies. I&#x27;ve broken many too but aside from that the jerdon is the best one. It lights up the best.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror does a great job of showing a close up of your face. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> It works great with one magnifying mirror and two natural ones. I&#x27;m able to put on make-up with the center magnifying mirror and then see what it looks like in the natural ones. It really works well. Star</li>
    <li> The mirror is great!  It works just like it is supposed to.  The lights allow you to change it according to the time of day.  It is easy to use and keep put away when you are finished using it.  The magnification side of the mirror allows you to see very clearly when putting on your make-up.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see without my glasses at close distances. Putting on even minimal makeup was a challenge, so I poured over reviews and picked this mirror. I&#x27;m glad I did. I can SEE! Putting on makeup won&#x27;t be a problem again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, one of the best features is the extra outlet. The mirror is using one plug and I dislike having to unplug the hair dryer to plug in the curling iron/whatever and the extra outlet on the front of the mirror eliminates the need for that. I don&#x27;t necessarily use the different day/home/office/evening setting very often, but it&#x27;s good to know the option is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was great, the mirror is great and I wonder now how I ever did without it. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror despite all the bad press about the bulbs burning out.  I loved it, which is why I gave it two stars.  I bought it less than ten months ago and it won&#x27;t turn on anymore, just as the reviews described.  I only paid about $22 for the mirror, so I&#x27;m not going to pursue warrantee replacement (I will take others at their word that this company is not reputable or responsive).  I&#x27;m going to try the Conair trifold despite others&#x27; complaints that the lights aren&#x27;t bright enough.  If it&#x27;s really great, I will update this review.  In the end, I&#x27;m thinking I will need to spend $25-50 per year if I want a functioning 3-way lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I am just updating my review. The Conair mirror is a POS!  If i can send it back, I will. The light is no better than the worst ambient lighting, and all parts of my face are still in shadows. I&#x27;m ordering another of these-my third in less than a year!  on the first one, I tried holding the on switch but it didn&#x27;t help; hopefully it worked for others.  I&#x27;m upgrading to 3 stars because I like it enough to buy another in less than a year.</li>
    <li> Deal o&#x27;the Day.  \\&quot;Cool,\\&quot; I thought.  \\&quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted one of those.\\&quot;  I thought it would be brighter than the 40 watt bulb and magnified mirror, which I was using.  OMG!!  Dim, dim, dim.  A total piece of useless trash.&lt;br /&gt;My current thinking is to rip the mirror out, prop it on my stapler, and use the 40 bulb lamp, previously jerry-rigged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am soooooo not happy, with this \\&quot;lighted\\&quot; mirror.</li>
    <li> Another gift purchase for a friend who loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like my make-up mirror. The lighting is right. I don&#x27;t guit need the x5 reflection. I think x3 would be enough.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a my wife, Christmas present.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly not the most expensive gift,  but the one that got the most attention and appreciation ... great purchase. Like we say in Maine, \\&quot;A Happy Wife is a Happy Life\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for in a makup mirror&lt;br /&gt;better than any of the makeup mirror that i have seen in the dept stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to replace a 10 yr old Conair. I love this new Jerdon mirror! Great lighting and easy set up. The florescent lighting is great! Would highly reccommend to anyone and at a good price. Shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> I have never rated any purchase from Amazon poorly.  This item, though, I would not suggest purchasing at all. The lights burned out on my older one and they cannot be changed easily, so I got a new one.  I had this brand before and after much research, I thought it better not to take a chance on a different one because I knew what I would get  NOT SO!  The 5X is not really 5X anymore. Maybe 3? But most of all it is so distorted that it is unusable. After struggling to use it,  I finally gave up and pulled the old one out of the trash. It was better to use the old one with no lights instead of the new one with great lights and a mirror that distorted my face so much that I could not use it to put make up on. VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for ten to fifteen years.  Recently, the bulbs went out and I discovered that there&#x27;s no easy way to replace them, so it seemed worth it to just buy a new mirror.  Actually, this one is a little bit better.  I think that lighting technology has changed a bit since I last bought it and the lever that changes the lighting is smoother.  My last one became very difficult to move and it eventually broke off every time I tried to move it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the option to change the lighting is fantastic and it gives off plenty of light to be able to do my makeup in low light situations.  I&#x27;m hoping it will last another ten to fifteen years, this is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror mainly because of the great reviews, and I&#x27;ve really loved it while it lasted. Bright lights, different color settings, and the mirror was not morphed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold, I started having the same problem where it partly light, then die out. I have contacted Jerdon about this, and even attached a private YouTube video so they could see what I was talking about. I got no contact back whatsoever. Bad customer service. I know they looked at the video too, because of the view count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m out a mirror... Maybe I&#x27;ll go invest in an Ottlite next.</li>
    <li> I have owned a makeup mirror for many years and this one is better than the other two I have owned.  This is one is more stable no matter what position you have it sitting in.</li>
    <li> This lighted mirror is the best one out there. When unfolded it takes up more counter space than others but it does it all well. The light can be filtered to taste.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife...She had using one of these that was about 10 years....The add with this one stated &amp;#34;The brightest bulb&amp;#34;...Not what we found out....The older unit was actually bright...Are in the process of trying to sell this one</li>
    <li> The mirror wasn&#x27;t entirely what I expected.  It&#x27;s rather small so you have to put your face just inches from the mirror.  The light doesn&#x27;t reflect off of the side mirrors very well, that&#x27;s probably because the light is weak and sets to far back into the unit.  Plus it has these different shades that distort the strength of the brightness which is the manufacturers&#x27; idea of different environments.  For me...it was a waist of money, but for others they might like it.  I won&#x27;t be the person to celebrate or promote a poor design.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my wife and she loves it. Says it&#x27;s the best lighted make-up mirror she has ever had and she&#x27;s 63. Plenty bright enough in all modes and the tri-view makes it even better. Makes me look pretty good as I got this for her on my own.</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it every morning.</li>
    <li> I read the good and the bad and bought this mirror anyway, and I am so glad I did.  I mainly got it for make-up application and to pluck my eyebrows. The light is really bright and perfect for eyebrow plucking. The magnification is powerful, with the light on and the magnifying mirror in place, it can be really bad for your self esteem ;) I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the light, but I have only had it for a month.  If the light begins to act up I will update my review.  I also really like how it folds up.  It is rather large but I was still able to fit it in a carry on bag and travel with it; it also survived in my checked luggage on the way back.  The ONLY reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I wish it was a little sleeker looking.  This mirror looks straight out of the 80s, so you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to leave it out on your vanity for guests to see.</li>
    <li> This product came and was true to its description.  It is a tri-fold mirror with very bright lights.  I purchased it for my 15 year old daughter. When I first received it, I turned on the lights and they were too bright so I instantly turned them off.  They hurt my eyes.  A couple of days later, my daughter used it to put on her make-up.  The bright lights triggered an ocular migraine and then triggered the first migraine headache that she had ever had. I would recommend it to the not so light sensitive.</li>
    <li> love this little mirror! it even has a plug in to use for my curling iron, i am very happy with this purchase and it got here fast too.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews here and went out and bought one anyway, because it truly is brighter than the majority of lit mirrors available.  I&#x27;ve loved it for the past 4 months, but recently in the past couple of weeks it has developed the lag time.  The bulb still works, but like others have experienced, there is now about a 5 second lapse between the time that I flip the switch and the time that the light comes on.  This started out a couple weeks ago as 2 seconds, then gradually increased, and I can only imagine that it will continue to do so.  :(  I have not had any problems with the bulb burning out as of yet.  The problem is annoying but manageable....however if it were to become 15 or 30 seconds I&#x27;d probably become really frustrated.  Otherwise, I think the mirror would be the best one available.  I switch between \\&quot;daylight\\&quot; and \\&quot;home\\&quot; because I find that \\&quot;office\\&quot; is simply green and \\&quot;evening\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t provide enough light.  Also, the stand is a little flimsy and can easily be toppled over, so they should build in some kind of lock to keep it more secure.  The outlet in the base of the mirror is very convenient, though I wouldn&#x27;t risk it with higher voltage appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: About a month after writing the review above, I turned on my mirror and it no longer comes on.  Yes, I tried holding the ON button for a while.  Nothing.  It&#x27;s dead.</li>
    <li> Old tri-fold makeup mirror needed to be replaced. Purchased the Jerdon JGL9W as it was very similar. Side mirror panels open up easily, clear, unmarred reflection. Center mirror swivels north-south and the 5x side is fine. As earlier reviews noted: the bulbs could stand to be brighter. The sliding switch at the bottom features : Day / Office / Evening / Home (lighting choices). On the 2nd day that switch locked into just Evening / Home. NEVER to move beyond Evening again. Other than that - item is sturdy, closes up neatly and hopefully will last at least 20 years as the one it replaced. ( Free shipping added to the appeal. )</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace almost the exact same one my mom bought me over 20 years ago. Not only does this one have more lighting settings, but it&#x27;s just slicker overall. I would recommend this product simply due to the fact that my last one lasted as long as it did and, in fact, my old one didn&#x27;t give out - it just was...well...over 20 years old and looked a little sad. I think this products is a great value for the price - I couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is as compared to how well made it is.</li>
    <li> The magnification is good, the adjustible height is good, but the lighting on this is horrible. Every setting flickers the entire time it&#x27;s on, which makes it very difficult to see. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> At 1st I thought this mirror was kinda nice.  Not as lighted as I need but better than what I had previously.  Set it up at my boyfriends for whom I only visit on the weekends.  2nd weekend, lights just shut off and there is no fancy way to get them to go back on.  No holding the switch or any of the other bologna posted on the reviews for which I thoroughly read and based my decision on when I made the purchase.  My boyfriend who is an electrician tested the outlet where the curling iron can be plugged in and yes there was power to it.  Switch tested fine, Lamps just quit and no way of changing them without sending it in to the manufacturer according to the manual.  What crap.  Less than 3 uses and this thing is junk and of course I wanted to return it to amazon but I&#x27;m a few days too late so I&#x27;m stuck eating the cost.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK.  I&#x27;m really tired of mail order crap.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my teenage daughter for Christmas. It was similar to one I had and loved as a teenager. Major difference is that I had mine for about 6 years with no problems and this one lasted a whole 8 months before the lights blew out. Not a big deal...you would think...BUT they can only be changed by a professional electrician! What a joke!! A product costing less than $30 costs more than double that to replace the bulbs? Give me a break. If I had known that I would never have bought it. I guess I&#x27;ll just have to deal with the make up in the bathroom...at least I can change those lights when they burn out. Maybe they should sell it cheaper and call it a disposable make up mirror. At least then consumers would understand they were not getting a quality product.</li>
    <li> Having the 3 mirrors and the magnifying mirror are a plus, but the light feature is a total waste. If the light feature is important to you, I would get something else.</li>
    <li> Got two of these for my 13- and 15-year old daughters.  They like them just fine.</li>
    <li> I received the Jerdon JGL9W mirror as a gift and within 6 months, the bulbs burned out. Holding down the on button does not work for me, as mine is a simple \\&quot;on\\&quot; or \\&quot;off\\&quot; switch, and not a button that I can hold down. The bulbs don&#x27;t flicker at all, no matter how many times I try to leave it on or turn it off and back on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after reading all the Amazon reviews, I contacted Jerdon and spoke with their customer service at 800-223-3571. Apparently, since this is a known, ongoing issue, the company is replacing the mirrors free of charge, no receipt required. Instead, they ask that you cut off the plug from your cord and mail it to the following address, along with the model # and your return address: Jerdon - Customer Service Department, 1820 N. Glenville Drive, Suite 124, Richardson, TX 75081. I asked why, and was told that they Jerdon ships the plugs to their manufacturer for credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror that they send will be the same model, so I would imagine that I&#x27;ll likely encounter the same problem again at some point. However, since it&#x27;s free and they replace it without a receipt, I figure that it can&#x27;t hurt. I love every other aspect of this product EXCEPT the terrible life of the bulbs, so it&#x27;s worth the bit of hassle until I find a better mirror or Jerdon creates a better model. My review would be a 5 star but for the life of the bulbs.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a makeup mirror for a while but no idea what kind.  This is great for me.  Several light changes to choose from.  It is just nice to stay seated and not have to stand and get closer to the mirror.  It works great and has everything that I wanted.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement mirror.The lighting button was improved from the one I owned before.I works so much better now. The magnification is very powerful.Same mirror,but it is much easier to light now.I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product, after reading reviews from others who liked it.  The lights are not bright enough, and the colored filters make them less so (as well as seeming like...well, just weird colors.  Furthermore, the side mirrors don&#x27;t want to stay in position;  they just flop open.</li>
    <li> light broke almost immediately</li>
    <li> I am using the mirror because I have no place in a one-bath home to do make up, but I needed the magnifying side because of eyesight. I can only see anything in it at a specific way I hold my face near the mirror, and that&#x27;s only like one eye at a time or other very small area.</li>
    <li> Bought this exactly one year ago from Amazon.  Dec 13, 2010.  It died today, so I am buying another.&lt;br /&gt;Its a wonderful mirror and works great.  Life of product apprently not that long.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot replace the bulbs or repair it yourself.  But a $23.99 I guess its a replace not a repair item.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the short life span, the product works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I bought another.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to put on her make-up. It seems that the bulbs burn out after a few months and cannot be replaced. I should have read reviews. If you search the web you will find product has bulb problems. Ened up buying a Conair TM7LX-320 Illumina Three panel Make-up Mirror w/4 Light Settings.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I expected. It works great, no issues whatsoever. I use it every day to put my makeup on. I really should buy 5 more to stock up for the rest of my life! Seriously, a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this mirror. It comes on as soon as I flip the switch, lighting is excellent. Could not ask for a better mirror!! I have had several different brands in the past and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Lasted five (5) months then the lights fizzled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsatisfactory &amp; irreparable .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why make a light design that cannot be repaired?</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived safely, however, when I unpacked it there was something plastic rolling around inside the mirror housing.  I plugged it in and it worked fine.  I am returning it because things shouldn&#x27;t be rattling around inside and because the light settings go from normal white light to green to pink/purple which seemed like unrealistic lighting choices.  It would have also been nice if the side mirrors could be flipped to 5x too.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter in college.  After having it for less than 3 months she called and said it wouldn&#x27;t work.  Of course, I can&#x27;t return it- can&#x27;t even contact the seller.  I do not recommend this product- might as well just shred the money and get a flashlight.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, we had to return the item as it was not suitable for our needs. It was impossible to use as it distorted one&#x27;s appearance too much.</li>
    <li> i love the side panel and that the main mirror rotates up and down instead of side to side.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she really loves it.</li>
    <li> I just received my Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-Fold Lighted Mirror.  Ordinarily, I would wait to review a product until I&#x27;d used it for a while but, since I bought this based on the good reviews I read here, I decided to warn people about its shortcomings as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, it doesn&#x27;t take that long to see the problems here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the low quality of the magnifying mirror that is the biggest problem (but not the only one).  And the magnifying mirror is the main reason to purchase this product, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the mirror in a very timely manner and in good condition.  The packaging was more than adequate.  I plugged it in and it turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What don&#x27;t I like?  Where do I start?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, worst of all, the 5X magnifying mirror is concave and, therefore, warps the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, the mirrors in general are low quality, the side mirror doors will not close completely unless you have the non-magnifying side on the front, and it&#x27;s front heavy.  The lighting is also nothing to get excited about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the front heavy part, my vanity stool is fairly low so I wanted to have it pretty upright.  But at the highest of the settings that are grouped together it wants to tilt over onto me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I can tilt the middle mirror so I can get by with a more slanted setting, but not the side mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst problem:  The 5X mirror, which is very low quality to begin with, is concave.  This is apparently deliberate because the plastic housing for that side of the mirror is also concave.  It&#x27;s been designed that way, though I have no idea why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there some reason I&#x27;m not aware of why a 5X mirror has to be concave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other mirrors are not terrible; nothing to brag about but not that bad.  But I buy a makeup mirror for the magnification, and the magnifying mirror on this product is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put together the low quality of the mirror AND the warp from the concave shape and I can only see myself somewhat clearly (in small areas, not my whole face at once) if I lean way forward and am within about 5-6 inches of the mirror.  Even then, it&#x27;s not a good image at all, and I&#x27;m uncomfortable to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the lights... well, I did not have to hold a button down to get it to turn on as I&#x27;ve read is the case.  This is a simple toggle switch and the lights come on instantly.  But the quality of the lighting is not good, either.  Can this really be the same model where I&#x27;ve read people brag about the lighting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only setting I could use would be the Day setting.  The Office setting makes everything look green, and the other settings don&#x27;t light up what I&#x27;m trying to see well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an oval Conair that I did not consider to be very good and, when it finally died, I chose this one because it sounded like a much higher quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair, with all its shortcomings, is much to be preferred over this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One could learn to live with the problems with the casing, the less than wonderful flat mirrors, etc.  Even the lighting, since there is one setting that would work reasonably well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the problems with the magnifying mirror are, as best I can tell, insurmountable.  Much as I dislike the hassle of returning something, this will have to go back.  Unless, of course, someone out there knows some magic where this situation is concerned.not my whole face at once) if I lean way forward and am within about 5-6 inches of the mirror.  Even then, it&#x27;s not a good image at all, and I&#x27;m uncomfortable to boot.    And the lights... well, I did not have to hold a button down to get it to turn on as I&#x27;ve read is the case.

    <li> Arrived not working - bought in Ocyober for Christmas and when she opened it it didn&#x27;t work and they won&#x27;t accept a return. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> returned daughter didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> This mirror works perfectly fine. The lighting options work well. I also like how the middle mirror can be adjusted.</li>
    <li> I had to rip the plastic colored strips off the bulbs or it would not have been bright enough.  I am using it for now but I wish I had bough the one without the additional side mirrors as they just get in my way.  The surface itself is not all that large and I wish the magnified side was a bit better.  I am already looking for something else but it is useable.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! Love the different light settings. It could have a cuter design but very functional nonetheless</li>
    <li> This is really and awesome mirror. It lights up very bright and works great for what it is made for. It was shipped fast and packaged very well.</li>
    <li> I always struggle when I go to order something and then read the reviews.  There were definitely some mixed reviews on this product as well.  I went ahead and ordered the mirror and to my great surprise it was everything I had hoped it was.  I have absolutely NO issues with this product, the lights turn on when I push the button and the outlet on the mirror itself works wonderful.  I plug in my hair dryer everyday and use it with NO issues.  Go ahead and order with no second thoughts.</li>
    <li> How do you take the Jerdon Model JGL9W apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT TRY TO PRY IT APART!  That will NEVER work.  I tried that. That is some tough plastic.  I found out that the back is not made to simply pop off.  And no amount of prying will get it off.  The unit is held together by four (4) rather substantial screws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where are the screws?  On the back of the unit you will see four (4) round slightly recessed areas.  The recessed plastic inside of these four circles hides the screw heads.  If you take a medium size phillips screw driver and press it into the center of that circle you should penetrate through the 1/16 inch or so of the covering  plastic, and find the screw head right underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I used the word \\&quot;if\\&quot; and \\&quot;should\\&quot; because I removed the plastic with a 5/16 inch forstner bit on my drill press, not knowing what was under there.  I thought it was a support post, internally glued, and I was going to separate it from the back by removing the plastic material around it. But, to my surprise, the drill bit hit metal quickly, and in that way I  found the screw head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Before you seperate the front and the back of the unit, use the flat end of a screw driver to pop out the slider knob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that caveat, when you get those four screws out, the unit comes apart easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I take it apart?  This unit worked fine for one year, and 11 months, wherein, it came to pass, that both of the lights stopped working.  Even if you held the switch down for a minute the lights would not light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because both lights would not light, I figured it was probably not an issue with the lights themselves.  I thought I might find something wrong with the switch. When I had the unit apart, and I plugged it in, I operated the switch, and it had a different feel to it, it clicked on, and it clicked off. Before I took the unit apart, the switch had no such mechanical feedback. I am not sure what I did to invoke that change in behavior.  Nevertheless, I was rewarded for my efforts, as is often the case in situations like this, where you make the effort, but you are not sure exactly what you did to make it work, but by golly, both the lights come on now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, if I had not broken one of the small brackets that holds one end of one of the lense movement assemblies during my effort to pry the unit apart with a big screwdriver, I could simply put it back together and give it back to my mom, as the lights appears to work fine now.  But because of this broken bracket issue I need to figure out how to glue it back on before I can put it back together.  I don&#x27;t see a major problem there. (Update: that was no problem.  I made a new bracket, glued it on, and the unit is reassembled and functioning properly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking inside this unit, I must report to you, that it is well made, and quite substantial.  I think people who buy this unit are getting a good deal.  All electrical connections are made with solid crimp connections, and everything is well insulated. The ballast transformer looks to be so substantial that one might expect it to last for a century or more. And the lense movement assemblies are quite cleverly and substantially designed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who want to know how to change the fluorescent light bulbs in this unit, i.e. if they ever did fail, well then, you would take the unit apart as described above.  Beyond that, the rest is speculation on my part derived from looking at the issue from the inside.  As noted I did not need to replace the bulbs in this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the case, on a label close to the bulbs, it tells you what kind of bulb you need.  However, the bulbs do not have sockets.  They are hard wired in there with crimp connectors.  To remove the old bulb or bulbs, you would have to clip the wires close to the bulb pins, remove the old bulbs, and put in the new ones, and then crimp the wires back onto the pins ofthe new bulb.  I suppose you could solder the wires on, using some shrink wrap insulation to make sure that there is no bare metal showing after you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a person to accomplish this successfully, you would need to have some electrical knowledge before hand.  Not a lot, but some.  Like don&#x27;t work on the unit while it&#x27;s plugged in.  And how to crimp, or solder, and how to insulate the bulb pin connections.  And how to keep track of where the wires go. You could take a digital photo first, before you disconnect anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the replacement of the light bulbs would be further complicated by the fact that these light bulbs are mounted inside of the lens movement mechanisms. It appears that the main mounting bracket (one per side) for the lens movement mechanism must be unscrewed and moved at least partially out of the way before you can get your hands on the phenolic strips which serve as the mounting structure for the bulbs, and through which the pins extend. I poked around in there and tried to see how these might come out. It is not clear. It Looks like somewhat of a mechanical puzzle. And when it comes to the lens movement mechanism, we are speaking about a string driven spring loaded apparatus, and it will take some mechanical aptitude to get it put back together and properly realigned, that is tracking from side to side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(To adjust tracking, you need to relieve the string tension on one side, and spin the lens into the proper position. I needed to do this before I put this unit back together.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the light bulbs in this unit is not impossible.  But it would NOT be considered easy.  Apart from the time it would take to find the right replacement bulbs, and have them at hand ready to install, I think you would be talking about a couple of hours of shop time, factoring in the time you will need to explore and fathom just how to get the old bulbs out of there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A factory technician who has done this a hundred times, who has the bulbs, the tools, and the experience, might be able to complete the job in about fifteen minutes.  A person who sees the inside of this unit for the first time will take longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are electrically and mechanically inclined, and have the time to spare, it might be an enjoyable project, which would pay some dividends, I think, in terms of making the end-user very happy.  Giving new life to an old friend will certainly give her something to smile about.wrap insulation to make sure that there is no bare metal showing after you are done.

    <li> I started using this type of mirror in the 1970&#x27;s. It was a revlon brand I believe. Jerdon is the only mirror I have been able to find that is still made like these were. I love this type of mirror. I bought my first Jerdon mirror approximately 7-8 years ago. It just recently quit working so I ordered another one since I had been so happy with this.</li>
    <li> This is what a makeup mirror should be! I know some of the other reviewers had problems with the light coming on right away, but I had no problems at all.  It didn&#x27;t take long at all to receive the mirror and it is nice and bright.  Best of all, I haven&#x27;t had to hold down the button to get the light to turn on.  If you want to see EVERY single detail of your face when putting on make up, then this is the mirror for you!</li>
    <li> Replaced the one I had for many years. A bit stronger magnifying than my old one but good product use it every day.</li>
    <li> Great lighting, bulbs go from top to bottom of mirror, different lighting settings, although I only use daylight because I like that lighting the best- best details seen. Flip it over for grooming- you&#x27;ll see EVERYTHING that needs attention- some days I&#x27;m not fond of the reflection, but at least I can see what needs plucking, concealing etc!! Has a &amp;#34;kick stand&amp;#34; so you can have it at many angles- great when you move from different height chairs. When I put it away I just wrap the cord around the folded mirror and this holds the kick stand in place. Thankful for reviewer who gave instructions on changing the bulb, so anticipating no problems. I like this MUCH better than the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Conair mirrors, that have 4 tiny bulbs- lighting on these is AWFUL.</li>
    <li> This is the best one out there. I had the same one before that lasted well over a decade. It had a different company name on it, however it was exactly the same item. I bought two to make sure I have one put away for future use. I&#x27;ve tried others, but the lighting and magnification were lousy compared to this model.</li>
    <li> This is one of the brightest mirrors out in the market.  I have purchased several and returned them all until I got this one.  You will not be disappointed. Price was reasonable too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed by this mirror. I ordered it early as a Christmas gift for my daughter. When she opened it, the mirror was broken. She said she would just use the magnifying mirror. Later when she plugged it in, the left light was pulsating. We said we could just replace the bulb. But then a few days later, she noticed a burning odor and realized something was burning inside the mirror base. When I checked it, I could still smell an electrical burning smell. Not giving this piece of junk any more chances. Just a horrible mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror&#x27;s light adjustment slider does not move and easily snaps off trying to do so. I have requested a return of this item. Very disappointed so far.</li>
    <li> Favorite mirror ever.  This is my second, that should say it all.  Good light and light selections.  Sturdy (until the airport luggage broke one of the mirrors!)</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, poor lighting for my 88 year old mom.</li>
    <li> I had no expectations when I purchased it, so I thinks it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s OK.  I also grew up using the Clairol version (which I absolutely loved) therefore, in comparison, I must point out that on the unit I purchased the micas that change the color settings for the lighting are not aligned equally on both sides, so the color output is not even; the magnification could be stronger than it is but I can work with it. Overall, it serves the purpose of sitting on my vanity and helping me see better when I apply my makeup, which is what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Fair price, fair product.</li>
    <li> Great lighting for application of makeup. Options from day to evening lighting. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I had one similar to this for years and it broke. I bought another mirror with a very small bulb and it was awful. Like putting makeup on in the dark! This mirror has florescent bulbs just like my original mirror and it works great. Nice and bright!!</li>
    <li> Great mirror and I like how it collapses.  Good quality. Great for vanity.  The magnification allows for good grooming.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mom.  The magnified mirror was distorted and it&#x27;s stuck on one lighting choice.</li>
    <li> I ignored the comments regarding this product about the bulbs burning out.  I figured that having done 10 years in electronic assembly that was something I could deal with if need be, WRONG!  My bulbs burned out after little more than a year and there is no way I can see to open the case so you can replace the bulbs, without breaking something.  I&#x27;m giving up and looking for a Conair product that I should get a good five years out of.</li>
    <li> Would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t heavy but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Could not get a clear image in the center mirror.</li>
    <li> Toggle switch to change light colors never moved. Be sure to hang onto box/receipt until you&#x27;re sure everything on it works correctly. Unfortunately too late for me now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these types of mirrors in the past and they lasted for Years!  This Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror only lasted 4 months before the lights went out!  This is the worst brand ever for tri-fold lighted mirrors.  Do Not By this Mirror!</li>
    <li> kept it plugged most of the time but always turned it off when not in use.  kept seeing these little burn specks on my wall and counter top.  then started seeing burn marks on the side of the mirror.  turned it on the last time, it sparked inside (on side right above on/off switch) then a small blaze sparked.</li>
    <li> This make-up mirror was hard to find, but good ole Amazon.com came through. I never go out without full makeup, so I am the \\&quot;makeup mirror expert\\&quot;. This mirror is the best. It has every feature you will need plus an electrical outlet right on the front.</li>
    <li> This mirror was sent as a present for a young lady who turned 15. The input we get from her family is that she uses it constantly. The feature she likes best is the lighting of the mirror as well as the magnification. We believe this is a wonderful and useful present for any age group but mostly so to growing up ladies for whom her looks is of utmost importance.</li>
    <li> The side lighting shines more into your eyes than highlighting your face to apply make up.  I had big hopes when I unpacked the mirror but I have been disappointed.  The mirrors are fine and I will continue to use without the lighting,</li>
    <li> After 20+ years, my Jerdon makeup mirror finally died.  As many others have noted, along with myself, it is hard to find a really good makeup mirror with the right amount of brightness.  It seems the the new round kind do not put off enough light to see yourself.  Well, when I found this Jerdon mirror on Amazon, I was very excited.  I read all the reviews and knew what folks where saying when they referenced the on/off switch and that you had to hold down for 10 seconds for the lights to stay on.  Since this makeup mirror served me well over the past 20+ years, I didn&#x27;t care and purchased another one.  To my very pleasant surprise, the makeup mirror was identical to my previous mirror, but they improved the on/off switch.  It is more a hard on/off flip vs. the soft hold for 10 seconds.  Maybe I needed to clean my previous mirror more, but the magnification side almost scared me -- wow, found hairs on my face I didn&#x27;t know I had :)&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this mirror if you are looking for a good mirror to replace your mirror from years ago, or younger girls just starting out with makeup.</li>
    <li> I have had many lighted make-up mirrors and this is by far the best i have found.  The lighting is bright &amp; accurate, and the different settings are very helpful.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup mirror I&#x27;ve ever used; about 7 since the 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The description for this item here only mentions that its magnification&lt;br /&gt;is 5x. That is only on one side of the mirror.  Just swivel it around&lt;br /&gt;for 1x.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror permits full-face lighting and I find that the light adjustments&lt;br /&gt;for Day, Office, Evening, and Home are quite accurate. This was a nice&lt;br /&gt;surprise; with other brands&#x27; lighted makeup mirrors such settings were&lt;br /&gt;useless.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased, I bought another unit; at this price I can afford the convenience&lt;br /&gt;of having one for the bedroom and another for the bathroom.  I find no difference&lt;br /&gt;in quality and/or light features between them.</li>
    <li> I recieved this mirror on time. It was packaged well so arrived in perfect condition. It was just what I was looking for. Great for putting on makeup and finding those difficult hairs to pluck. I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have had this make up mirror for less than a year and it has failed. The light comes on for less than a minute, then goes out. I was looking forward to a good replacement for my old Clairol True to Light mirror that lasted for literally decades, and I am disappointed that I got such little life out of this one. I would not recommend purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  Nice size.  Fits in my backpack when we are camping.  Lighting is good.  Middle mirror swivels up and down to allow perfect viewing.</li>
    <li> I had a lighted mirror similar to this one for more than 20 years.  I gave it away when I moved a few years ago, and boy, have I regretted it ever since!  Last year, I bought 6 or 7 different lighted mirrors (round or oval) from all of the major brands and returned all of them because they were way too dark.  Then I found this one, and now I&#x27;m happy!  It is still not as bright as my old one, but it is surely MUCH brighter than all the others.  I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Received Jerdon Mirror - JGL9W - plugged it in and the light doesn&#x27;t turn on. Tried several different outlets....the product is defective. Sally Beauty Supply doesn&#x27;t pay for return postage costs on returns. I will never order from them again. Learned a lesson from this purchase, check the return policy of vendors doing business on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lighted Makeup Mirrors since I was 16 years old.  Now that I am over 50, I need the magnified mirror to apply my cosmetics.  The magnified mirror tends to make you look distorted.  I will be returning the mirror for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one feature that I really like on this model is having an outlet for my curling iron, however, I can do without that and I will go back to the Conair.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Jerdon JGL9W Lighted Mirror less than one (1) year ago. The lights have stopped working, and from what I can tell the lights can not be replaced. Do not purchase it unless you are willing to replace it within a year of buying the product.[[ASIN:B0000AFUT3 Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror]]</li>
    <li> I like the size, I like the flip mirror with the magnification on one side. However, the light just isn&#x27;t bright enough. The lighting where I do my makeup is horrible so I really really was relying on this mirror giving me all the lighting I needed to do my makeup. Now I find when I get to work in bright fluorescent lighting I didn&#x27;t blend quite well enough because I thought I looked great in my dark room! I guess I will need to buy a new light fixture for my entire bedroom...</li>
    <li> I LOVE my mirror. I almost purchased a less expensive one and I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t. It is much bigger than I thought too. It has plenty of position slots so you can use it almost anywhere. It has 4 settings for day, night, home and office. The lights never get hot and that&#x27;s a big plus when putting on your makeup. It closes up nicely so you can travel with it. It has a nice finish on it so it is very easy to clean. I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> It is decently built but the lighting is not as bright as I would have desired. I have to add couple more lights, to make it better. Don&#x27; t want to return it but not truly satisfied with it.  Will not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works just like I wanted. Has extra plug in, bright lights, and better price than I could find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I love that the middle mirror is moveable. This makes applying eye makeup much easier.  It actually flips all the way around so you can use the magnifying mirror.  I also like that you can position the entire unit up or down.  The only improvement I would make would be stronger lighting.  I am loving my new mirror!</li>
    <li> This is just what i was looking for ! It was like one I had in high school and couldnt find it anywhere. I&#x27;d been looking for years. The different lightings settings are wonderful &amp; the size is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok ,could have been 10 power instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This Makeup Mirror worked ONE TIME ONLY.. I had this same model Before, and it lasted about 3 -4 years,..The New one I just Purchaced Broke (would not turn on) after the First use..  Sandy,  Beaumont, Texas  ( P.S. I am ordering a Conair !!)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item even after reading some of the bad reviews. The good reviews convinced me to give it a chance, and I am glad I did. It is getting difficult to find this style of make-up mirror anywhere but on line, and I am pleased that I found this one at such a reasonable price (eBay is outrageous)!  The mirror fits well on my dressing table, and the lighting is perfect. I have found that I only have to hold down the on switch for about 3 to 4 seconds (all fluorescent lighting takes it&#x27;s time). The outlet in the front is quite convenient,  and I don&#x27;t think that the magnification side of the mirror is any more distorted than any other magnification mirror I have seen. All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase, and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> returned. Not enough light</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror a long time now, and it&#x27;s great. I had bought another one that couldn&#x27;t be adjusted vertically, and the mirror was too high for viewing. I took it back and sent for this one. I love this one!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s why.... I searched high and low for a decent lighted makeup mirror similiar to the one I had for years. My old mirror was a Windmere, lasted about 12 years. Prior to that I had a Clairol (lighting was just OK). Days of web searches led me to those horrible round halo lighted mirrors (they just look good on a counter) and serve no purpose. This Jerdon is basically the same mirror as my old Windmere. Very sturdy, great lighting, large rectangle mirror, side mirrors, vertical 360&#x27; rotation, 5X magnification on reverse side of mirror and 11 mirror positions, also an extra electrical outlet on front for appliances. The ISSUE regarding previous reviewers complaints about the lighting. You MUST hold the ON button down about 3 seconds to allow for the bulbs to light. The lighting on this mirror is superior to others I have seen. It weighs about 6 lbs and folds nicely away. The negatives to this mirror are: the bulbs make a slight buzzing noise when in use (typical of this type of bulb) and the electrical outlet was installed upside down on my product, therefore the mirror must be collapsed to a lower position to allow enough room for the plug. I consider these to be minor complaints considering the product services all my needs. If you want to go out of the house looking like you intend, this is the mirror for you. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. The quality is exceptional, and the outlet is an extra \\&quot;plus\\&quot; for curling irons, etc.</li>
    <li> Traveling a lot and needing a mirror, I ordered this for delivery to my next destination and have not been disappointed.  It was there on arrival, the mirrors are not wavey, the lighting is good, and it folds nicely for my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0000AFUT3 Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror]]</li>
    <li> What a versitle mirror. It is one the better mirrors for the price.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has used this mirror twice now and very much enjoyed it.  The lights have worked, etc...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for two years now and I love it!  I haven&#x27;t had any electrical problems at all and I use it almost every day.  It&#x27;s not the prettiest mirror around, but it functions very well.  I wanted a big, bright mirror and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this mirror and love it...I was replacing a Remington lighted mirror that I had for many many yrs....The lighting on this new mirror is just as good and the light color is true and natural.</li>
    <li> I wear progressive lens so I need a mirror that I could see without wearing my glasses. This one fits the bill nicely. Also most too good, lets you see all the imperfections in your skin. I had no trouble with the light working.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Fianc&amp;eacute;.  She absolutely loves it and uses it daily.  Awesome item.</li>
    <li> Surprised my wife with it and she is happy as a lark!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago, and the light doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore. The bulb is out, but it is hard to replace it- you would have to open up the whole mirror to be able to do that. Before I bought it, I saw the review here of a man who bought it for his wife and he said to just hold the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button and it would turn on. I think the model he bought his wife was another one because mine had an on and off switch, so obviously I couldn&#x27;t hold it down to try that suggestion. While it was working, the mirror was pretty good, but the only setting I used was the \\&quot;daylight\\&quot; setting. The others were settings that I didn&#x27;t need, like one that gave a green tint. The way it is leaning is pretty flimsy. I would accidentally hit it and it would slam down. It was decent while it lasted, but one year was not long.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Quality, lighting, and magnification are all great. The oval, metal mirrors look better but this baby works better.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very similar to the Windmere unit that I had for about 10 years and loved until it wouldn&#x27;t turn on any more.  The lighting on the Jerdon is clean and bright and the overall design is good.  However, the quality of the mirrors is such that the reflection is distorted, especially on the magnified side.  I&#x27;m not talking about the distortion that the magnification naturally creates.  Unlike the magnification distortion, my eyes take a few moments to adjust to this distortion (sort of like putting on someone else&#x27;s prescription eyeglasses).  This is likely due to the reflective surface being of a lesser optical quality.  So far it&#x27;s the the best I&#x27;ve found without spending big bucks, but perhaps that&#x27;s why some other mirrors are more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/3/10 UPDATE.  I have found the distortion the mirror causes to be too irritating.  Also, the lights are taking longer and longer to turn on.  I will be looking for a different mirror soon.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for. I looked in several stores but could not find anything like this. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. The one I had before was a Clairoi and lasted 30 years before it finally bit the dust. I suspect this one will last just as long since its made even sturdier. Since I&#x27;m near-sighted the magnified side of the mirror helps me with my makeup and other closer work I do, the light is terrific and helps also and is easy to control.  I woud recommend this mirror to all those gals who find wall mirrors in bathrooms just too far away to apply make-up precisely.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0000AFUT3 Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror]]&lt;br /&gt;When my Clariol true to light mirror would no longer light after over 15 years, I was devastated. It was a great mirror. I hesitated buying the Jerdon mirror after reading some of the negative reviews. After looking at local stores and seeing only junk, I decided to purchase Jerdon. The best decision I ever made! It works great, the negative reviewers must have gotten a defective product or just lack patience because my mirror lights up in a second after pressing and holding the ON switch. It is not an eternity. The manufacturer has an instruction label above the switch, easy to follow. Like my Clariol mirror, the Jerdon has an electrical output on the mirror. It is so convenient for a curling iron. The light is just a good as my previous mirror. The magnification is better too. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The mirror has great lighting and doesn&#x27;t take up much space opened or closed. This was my wife&#x27;s favorite present she received for Christmas! Very Happy With it!!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these from Amazon 3 years ago.  After that time, one bulb burnt out and we can&#x27;t replace it. But, my teenage daughter probably had it turned on at least 7-10 hours per week.  So she got great use of it and she was happy with it!  I was disappointed that the lighting was not brighter.  In general, the lighting is dim even at it&#x27;s highest sitting.  I love this style of mirror and lighting design.  I had one like this in the 1970&#x27;s and loved it.  Now I am looking for a replacement.  There are very few of this design out there.  If I can&#x27;t find a better rated lighted tri-fold makeup mirror, I will buy this one again.  The main thing was that my daughter was satisfied with it.  The second Jerdon tri-fold lighted makeup mirror I gave as a Christmas gift to my daughter&#x27;s friend.  She complained about her&#x27;s, but she complains a lot in general.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find in retail stores. So I relied on amazon for a vanity mirror. This particular product was rated highly, &amp; I must agree. I&#x27;ve had not 1 problem with it. Im illuminated better than I would be in any other light so to speak. It is the best vanity mirror I&#x27;ve come across, &amp; im a stylist w/20 years of experience. I bring it with me on set &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with its performance. Thank you amazon for my life saver.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an old General Electric makeup mirror I&#x27;ve had for over 30 years which still works, but not as well as it used to.  The Jerdon model was just ok to start with.  Oddly it does not give off that much light and I found it hard to see.  After less than a year it stopped working altogether.  Went back to my old mirror (glad I didn&#x27;t pitch it) and been happier with that. It&#x27;s old, but at least I can see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> Good magnification on the reverse mirror but the lighting throws lots of shadows and the alternate lighting choices (other than day) are really strange colors.  I will be returning this product and updating my bathroom bulbs instead.</li>
    <li> I was so glad when I found this mirror. I have been looking for one like it a long time.  I only wish the on/off switch works a little faster.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror! I purchased the Jerdon as a replacement for my halo mirror and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I can see so much more of my face now! The lights are bright and the 4 different light settings are fantastic. Now I no longer worry about looking like Bozo the Clown when I step out into various types of lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another wonderful feature is the adjustable side mirrors. They help ensure  the perfect application of blush and bronzer on the cheeks. These folding side mirrors also allow you to see clearly as you contour the sides of the face. I don&#x27;t know how I ever did my makeup without those side mirrors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5x magnification is great too. Applying eye makeup and plucking eyebrows is a breeze now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the mirror&#x27;s stand makes it a bit too bulky for my traditional vanity. Since my vanity is 13 inches deep, it sits too close to the edge of it. No worries for me though...now I have an excuse to get a bigger vanity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase and have recommended this mirror to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a year ago.  The lights only worked for about a month. I followed all of the instructions as well as the tips given in these reviews.  Even my husband the Electrical Engineer couldn&#x27;t get it to work. The lights will occasionally come on and a slight distortion in the magnifying side didn&#x27;t bother me.  I could see well when it worked.  I should have returned it but was ill at the time.  I don&#x27;t advise buying this mirror.  You may get one of the \\&quot;bad ones\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandmother for Christmas- she likes using the make up mirrors now that she&#x27;s gotten older and doesn&#x27;t see as well. She previously had a ConAir one for years before it died. She initially loved all the different settings and options on this one, but then within 3 months of use, the lights died. I read the reviews and gave her the instructions that some other users had suggested, but to no avail. Now her birthday is coming up and I&#x27;ll be buying her another mirror to replace this one. Definitely not a quality product!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter, who is very well pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I like the different settings, I LOVE the fact that I can plug in my blowdryer.  It&#x27;s nice that it folds up, so I can take it with me if I need to.  It got me out of the bathroom, and being that I&#x27;m the only girl in the house - that is really saying something.</li>
    <li> I love this item. I had one very similar to it as a teenager and I actively sought out another one. I love that it has the extra outlet in the front for a hair dryer or hot iron and that you can adjust the lighting for different situations like daylight, office light, evening and home so you know your makeup will be seen the way it was intended. The magnifying side of the mirror makes it so much easier for these \\&quot;slightly\\&quot; older eyes to see what I want without squinting and the folding side mirrors gives me a nice panoramic view.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping time was PHENOMENALLY fast and it arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I look forward to future purchases.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the good doc scare you off.  His wife may have gotten a lemon, but I&#x27;ve used mine daily for several months now, even dropped it once, and it has performed beautifully.  Good make-up mirror at a great price!</li>
    <li> Have enjoyed this lighted mirror for many months. The extra electrical outlet is great to use for a hair dryer and or electrical hot iron, curling brush etc.  THanks,</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this purchase. I got it in Nov and after using it for 2 months, it started tripping the circuit breaker. I can no longer turn it on with an electrical problem. Amazon only takes Christmas returns for items purchased after Nov 1 and I purchased Oct 29. So now I&#x27;m stuck with an item I can&#x27;t use. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this to have more light with my vanity, it is bright, but it doesnt give you enough light for the top and bottom of your face and I kind of have to turn my face towards the lights on the side in order to properly apply my makeup. I do like the trifold though, I can see my coverage better on the jawline where I could never see before with just one mirror, the two side lights though have adequate lighting. shipping was super fast though!</li>
    <li> My ancient Remington makeup mirror with fluorescent tubes for lighting was the same style as this Jerdon. I had to go without a makeup mirror for a couple days until this arrived.  I did an exhaustive online search to find an old style mirror.  I hate the new round mirrors with halo lighting that one finds at Target, Sharper Image, Bed, Bath and Beyond, etc. I can&#x27;t see with the new lighting. I am pleased with the mirror, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between it and the old Remington.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, and it&#x27;s better than anything else out there. I&#x27;m just thrilled to have an old-style mirror again! For the price, style, and availability, it&#x27;s great!  After a couple days without a lighted mirror, the need for tweezers really showed up on it!  It works well for me!</li>
    <li> The mirrors were nice. I liked that it had different lighting settings, but the light was not very bright and it illuminated your face oddly. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I have bought a dozen make-up mirrors.  This particular mirror is amazing.  The lights are bright, but you can see your face and with incredible detail to apply cosmetics.  All the other mirrors (including some that looked a lot like this) shine a bright light in your eyes and you can&#x27;t really see your face.  In addition, the three mirrors can be positioned to see the side of your face, and are crucial for eye liner or any other application that you need side visuals.  I will stick with this brand and model from now on.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same lighted makeup mirror since I was a teen. The mirror was getting distorted and getting black spots plus the lighting was not as bright as it used to be. After putting on my mascara I would need to put on glasses and use a Q tip to get the mascara off of my eyelid. Sometimes only half (1 side) would light so I decided its time to buy a new one. I purchased this one and I just Love it !!! It has a nice bright light and the mirror is also great. I no longer have to use my glasses because I can see when applying my mascara. I  definately recomend this product.</li>
    <li> This item came to be defective in that only three of the four settings worked; the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting would not.  Also, the back of the item has a long plastic piece that you use to place the item up or tilted back.  This negates the ability to push the mirror back on the dresser; it sticks way out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror after I had to dispose of one that I had used for 20 years.  It is great!! The magnifying side is just right and the different colors of beams help you put on your make-up in the correct lighting for your activity.  I was so excited to find one so close to the one I had previously used.  I tried one of the oval lighted mirrors but that was aweful and the light burned out after a few months and I was unable to replace it.  This mirror will last me a long time and is easily trasportable.</li>
    <li> gave as a gift and they like it.</li>
    <li> These tri-fold rectangular lighted mirrors are almost impossible to find in the stores anymore, and if you do find one, there is ususally a lot of distortion on the magnified side.  This mirror has very little distortion if any, on the magnified side.  Good lighting and the selection of light settings is nice. I love this mirror and it&#x27;s a great value.  It&#x27;s far superior to the round lighted mirrors that now dominate the market.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive a new tri-fold lighted mirror to replace one the one my cat broke, but horribly disappointed in the lights - they would not come on (very dim like a flourescent trying to come on at the beginning) and just would not brighten up like they should - I returned it.  It may have been a fluke with this particular one?</li>
    <li> This lighted tri-fold mirror does exactly what I needed it to do.  I had a similar one several years ago and never found a good replacement till now.  So far, I am perfectly satisfied.</li>
    <li> The mirror was fine but the whole unit takes a lot of space. It is heavy and non portable. I did not find the different settings for office light, home etc very useful.</li>
    <li> I Purchased 3 makeup mirrors before finding the one I liked. The lighting was always inadequate. But the Jerdon lighting was exactly what I was looking for  and the magnification is perfect.I highly recommend Jerdon.</li>
    <li> This mirror would cost you twice the price at your local linen store. Our family now has two of these mirrors &amp; we wouldn&#x27;t trade them for anything. Works great &amp; is portable since it folds up flat.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The mirrors are a good quality and the lights are adequate to see to apply make-up.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a mirror with lights so it can help me while I was doing my makeup. The size of this mirror is great and the light is bright enough. I didn&#x27;t want something to bright because it will hurt my eyes when I am to focus. The sides stay in place and it also helps while I am doing different part of my face. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will help you on doing your makeup. I will recommend using this mirror.</li>
    <li> Had it for a week, used it THREE times...after that the lights won&#x27;t go on.  I completely understand how to operate the on/off, it&#x27;s not that, the bulbs literally fail after just a few uses just like most of the other customer feedback say they do.  It WILL be complicated if you try to replace the bulbs.  It&#x27;s not just open it up with a philips screwdriver and replace them with bulbs bought at the local hardware shop, nope.  One review says an electrician is required.  I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not going to try and incur more costs than I&#x27;m already in for.  I just know that I can&#x27;t do it myself.</li>
    <li> Terrible! Terrible! The first one I got the light switch was jammed and wouldn&#x27;t slide. I returned it giving the item another chance and this time the lights were not in sync - one side was on day while the other was on night! Tear-ri-ble!</li>
    <li> This product was such a disappointment. As soon as I received and opened it I noticed an immediate problem. As several other reviewers mentioned the lever that controls the light settings is very difficult to move.  I couldn&#x27;t even get the lever to move through all of the settings.  It ended up popping off with very little effort applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different light settings are also poorly designed.  The two vertical lights on either side of the center mirror have colored plastic lining that spins around when the light setting lever is moved.  Depending on the different settings a different color moves over the lights.  It was terrible.  None of the setting were appropriate and not conducive to applying makeup.  Mine must have been damaged in the shipping as well, because the colored plastic in the right light was off kilter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this makeup mirror over 16 months ago, and it still works as wonderfully as it did the day I bought it. I use this at least once daily for about10- 20 minutes. I love having the four different light settings, and will often do a quick \\&quot;check\\&quot; how my makeup looks after I&#x27;m finished applying it under all 4 light conditions. I primarily use the center mirror flipped over to the magnified side with the daylight setting for tweezing my eyebrows and for applying mascara, occasionally liquid eyeliner. For me, the daylight setting is the brightest and helps me to see every detail, and with my astigmatism, this has helped me a great deal. FYI, the side mirrors are adjustable from side to side, but are not magnified, in case that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the extra outlet, and will most often use it to plug in my vacuum cleaner of all things, when I vacuum our bedroom, rather than a curling iron or hair dryer, like most normal people would, as I prefer doing my hair in the bathroom. The easle portion of the back of this makeup mirror makes it easily adjustable to however I need it, so I&#x27;m not stuck having to sit in one or two particular positions to use this. Also, the two side mirrors help me to see the side views of my face while applying my blush, so I can be sure it looks right from not only head-on with the main mirror, but also from the sides WHILE applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makeup mirror and it&#x27;s exterior are very easily cleaned and shutting the side mirror doors when finished helps keep the interior mirrored portions dust-free. The back easel stand is collapsible if you so choose, and this makes it easy to store if you don&#x27;t want to leave it sitting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this has been a wonderful and versatile makeup mirror that has allowed me to see very clearly what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> When my old makeup mirror gave out, I immediately began to try to replace it. Since it was not in production anymore, I chose the nearest one I could get to it. It was delivered promptly, and I am using it every day. I like the fact that it has two side mirrors, the different lighting choices (such as day, office, evening), and the lights down the side of the middle mirror. I am really enjoying using it and hope it lasts as long as its predecessor.</li>
    <li> For just under 2 months, this mirror worked great. The trifold mirrors were wonderful. Last night the lights flickered on the mirror.  This afternoon both bulbs went out. Since it&#x27;s been over 30 days since the purchase, I&#x27;m out of luck to return this for replacement. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great lighting and multiple ways to stand it up.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!!! I love the price even more.  This mirror helps me to achieve the look i want to achieve when applying my makeup</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for my daughters back in January.  They haven&#x27;t used them very much, but one of them has the lights burned out already.  I guess I should have paid more attention to the bad reviews.  If you get unlucky and get a bad unit, then you&#x27;re stuck with it if it&#x27;s after 30 days from the purchase.  I can&#x27;t find any way to contact someone about the supposed one year warranty.  I am surprised that Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer any help since this is an item that they are selling directly.  Oh well, I guess that&#x27;s my good money down the drain.  Everyone beware and don&#x27;t buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/2/10  I found the customer inquiry number for jerdon and spoke with them about the mirror.  They had me return the cord of the unit and then shipped me a new one.  It took about a month to get here, but it arrived last week.  So I can vouch for the fact the company does stand by its warranty.  I have changed my rating from a one to a three, since I still believe that the quality of the units are lacking since so many people are complaining about the units going out in such a short time.  My original unit did not last long, and, as of right now, I have no faith that the new one will last any longer than the first one.  So, I changed my rating to an OK.</li>
    <li> I have read several of these reviews and find that I am having the same problem: the bulbs die out and cannot be replaced unless I return the product to the manufacturer. The brochure that came w/ this stated these \\&quot;should never need replacing.\\&quot; However, it states that if this \\&quot;malfunction\\&quot; should occur, I should return it and they will service it. Because it is more than 1 y old, I have no idea what the cost of this will/would be. Based on reports in reviews, I have to wonder if this is worth the time/trouble/cost of shipping. Actually, I feel fortunate that these lasted more than 1 y based on many of these reviews! What a shame!! This product has many design features that I really like, but next time I will go w/ a product that has lighting that can be replaced---really there are no light bulbs (even fluorescent) that last all that long!</li>
    <li> This lighted mirror is actually really nice.  I have bought previous lighted mirrors, and they just weren&#x27;t that bright.  I really like the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting.  The price is right, and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these makeup mirrors for my two daughters for Christmas.  This is now 9 months later and both of them quit working,  thinking that maybe they both had light bulbs go out the same weekend, so looked for them, but they sell the mirror and bulbs for all the other mirrors, but not for this one.  It sure is strange that they both stopped working after nine months.  Wonder if that was planned by the manufacturer, to sell more mirrors?  I will be purchasing 2 more but not this kind, ever again. I could not rate this low enough.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror 5 months ago in spite of some negative reviews.  I realize sometimes you can get your hands on a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; and I decided to take the chance that the burnt out bulbs would not happen to me.  I was satisfied when I recieved it and have been satisfied with it until one of the \\&quot;long-lasting\\&quot; bulbs clearly burnt out (gray at one end) and prevents the other from lighting. It began as a flicker 2 days ago, now... no light.  No changeing these bulbs on your own.  The manual says if a light burns out to ship it to them so they can service it.  No offer of S&amp;H paid for not to mention doing without the mirror for who knows how long. This mirror was a little pricer than others but you get what you pay for, right? Not!  I&#x27;m going to Wal-mart to buy the cheap Revlon mirror.  Grrrrr.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great and has good light...BUT it does not sit on the desk top flat, it rocks back and forth.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror so much that I bought a second one.  My first one is working just fine but I worried that they&#x27;d stop making it by the time I need a new one.  Brightness is the most important thing to me and this is just great in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 2 days to get into the habit of holding down the &#x27;on&#x27; button (for maybe a second or two) until the lights turn on.  Now it&#x27;s just second nature to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the closest thing to Clairol&#x27;s True-to-Light mirror that&#x27;s still available.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who works in make-up sales.  She absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> Supporting arm broke in back with light use</li>
    <li> What I love about this mirror the most is that it folds down and you can put it away. Also you can see the makeup from different angles using the side mirrors. For example you can see if your bronzer is well placed on each side.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 4 different lights and I like playing around with it to see how my makeup looks in each light.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is in need of a makeup mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this mirror, I owned a smaller one and that one broke.  So glad it did! Made my life easier to buy this one!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best make-up mirrors I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The lights are terrific and the magnifying mirror is the best!  I wish I would have known about this Jerdon mirror years ago.</li>
    <li> 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought - the only one with a truly bright enough light!  Love the on-off switch separate from the light settings so you can set it and forget it!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  I was looking for a bright, big mirror with different settings and this is it!  Easy to use, mirrors show a lot, magnify mirror is perfect, lightweight, folds up for easy travel..  Love it!  One of the best vanity mirrors out there.  And the best price too!</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of  these mirrors. gave one to myslf,one to my daughter, and one to my daughter-in-law. We love it !!!!!!! I have always used a make up  mirror but this one is the BEST. We  received it  on the date that you stated...Again,we love it.</li>
    <li> at first it worked great, then totally died after 24 hours. the previous one i have, has worked for 20 YEARS. not an exaggeration. i was very disappointed. so it&#x27;s a roll of the dice here people.</li>
    <li> The light on this mirror is very dim . It&#x27;s rather large for its size and a bit clumsy to use.</li>
    <li> It was  exactly what I  wanted. I had another one very similar to  this one and it lasted me around 10 years.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to have very good quality. The one we got worked once or twice, then quit. The slide for the different lights was hard to operate. We ended up with a Conair that looks better and actually works.</li>
    <li> Good magnification, good lighting and tone range, complete view of face and hair with fold out side mirrors. Bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> After my old True to Light mirror burned out, I could not find another mirror that worked.  I tried a couple of those new round lighted mirrors, and althought they might look nicer, you just cannot see!.  Terrible lighting for makeup application.  I also purchased another trifold mirror,(I think Clairol) but it had only small bulbs.  That one, also, was returned.  Finally I came across the Jerdon that had the tube type lights.  Great mirror, I would recommend it to all.  The bulbs are supposed to last for the life of the mirror.  My old True to Light lasted for many years, so I believe that.</li>
    <li> I like the product. I was contemplating about the mirror because of the lighting. I was wondering would this work for me. Considering the fact that, I love to arch my eyebrows. This mirror works fine.</li>
    <li> Just received and set up this mirror on my vanity/desk. I wish I had paid closer attention to the size dimensions, because it is pretty small for what I wanted it for. However, that is my fault. If you have limited space, 9\\&quot; x 12\\&quot; (fully extended) may work for you. There are several color settings for the lighting such as day, evening, home and office. The day is bright white, the office turns me green, the evening is just kind of dim, and the home gives me a rosy glow. If lighting in restaurants were like the home setting, I would be a happy person. I&#x27;ll never use the office setting and probably not the evening. I think day has the most honest light, so I will probably use that the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is made of plastic which gives it a cheap look and feel, but it will do the job. The competitor mirrors were all made of plastic, too, so I don&#x27;t really hold that against it. I liked it for the folding sides, so that it can be angled to see different areas. This is a nice feature and the sides stay in place where I set them. It was not expensive, so it is a decent value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are warnings on the mirror and paperwork enclosed that flickering may occur. This did happen a lot after I first set it up. There is a gas in the lamps that moves about and it was probably stirred up from shipping. I turned it on and off a few times, like the warning said to. It helped some, but the flickering didn&#x27;t go away right away. I tapped lightly on the light and it eventually settled into a steady light. Honestly I think most of this flickering was due to shipping and it just needed to settle. It says flickering can happen from uneven electrical current from your outlet, too. If that happens, it says to turn it on and off until it goes away. I am not there yet.</li>
    <li> I did like this mirror for the year that the bulbs lasted, but there is no way to open the mirror to replace the bulbs that have burned out, so it is a product with a very short lifetime that apparently would need to be replaced yearly. Maybe it is supposed to be a gimmick but I don&#x27;t know anyone who would buy another one so it sure backfires on Jerdon - the word is out.  I purchased a new Ott-lite mirror with replaceable bulbs and like it much better than I did the Jerdon.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror. I have really bad eyesight  and even without my glasses or contacts I&#x27;m able to see what I&#x27;m doing. The only practical setting on the lighting is the first setting everything is stupid and unusable but it doesn&#x27;t keep from making this a great mirror.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the mirrors didn&#x27;t work after I plugged them in. From what I&#x27;ve read in these reviews I think the manufacturer needs to rework the design to include better quality bulbs. Had to return them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly impressed with this mirror. I received it as a gift from my fiance and it lights well and the magnification is pretty good. I love how the size is perfect to store away or place on a small surface.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 15 year old.  She LOVES it and continues to tell me so!  It&#x27;s very versatile and the magnification is excactly the right strength for her needs.  When I was growing up, my sisters had this same style of mirror and they loved it then, that&#x27;s why I went with it over the single oval mirrors on the market today.</li>
    <li> This makeup mirror is great. It gives several different lighting options and the triple mirrors ensures no mistakes.  No problem&lt;br /&gt;turning it on, it works well.</li>
    <li> This is an OK product, but keep in mind, it is not very good at sitting up, it falls down for me all the time, and its pretty bulky too.  It dosnt look very nice on my desk because of this issue.</li>
    <li> Wife loved the gift. She said it did everything that she would have wanted. Since she&#x27;s happy, I am, too.</li>
    <li> The jedon makeup mirror was a complete dissappointment as it burnt out when we first plugged it into the powerpoint</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a little over a year, and already, the bulbs are dying.  The lights go on and then dim off within a minute.  The previous make-up mirror I purchased lasted 15 years without the bulbs dying.  Also, when pressing the on button to the right to turn it on, it often flips back to the left, and the lights turn off.  I&#x27;ve had to push a stapler up against the switch to keep it to stay on.</li>
    <li> This is crappy craptastic craptacular as can be. Too bad I fell for the video that played on youtube. Thanks for nothing Sally hansen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than 2 months and the light on the right is pink ! It stays pink .Very disappointed</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Jerdon Tri-Fold Lighted Mirror...2nd because the lights burned out in less than 2 years on the first one.  However, I searched for a couple of months for other options and none are as brightly lit as this one.  So, I bought another one and can truly see well with it.  If you are over 50 and want real magnification, you may wish to buy this for general use and a small 10-15x magnification mirror for the real detail work such as brows.  I put the 10x mirror in front of this one to use the light on the tri-fold for the 10x mirror.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror a few weeks ago.  The size is great and I love the 5x mirror.  However, the bulb on the right side was only half illuminated.  I looked in the manual to see if mentioned what I could do for this problem but it didn&#x27;t say anything.  I called Jerdon and told them the problem and they sent out another one immediately.  I just received that one yesterday and the lights work great.  If the lights keep working, I will definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great mirror but the magnification makes things a little blurry.  My old mirror exactly like this was not like that.  Other than that this is a great mirror.</li>
    <li> this foots the bill if you want to view your face up close, it has a nice feature of different lightings so you can see what color/shade you need in different lights (day/evening,etc) I had no problem with the switch, came right on/brightly. really like this mirror</li>
    <li> My only problem with this Jerdon Tri-Fold Lighted Mirror is I wished the magnifier on the mirror was greater. I have eye problems and I did expect more magnification.  But overall the mirror is very well lighted and the side panels can be closed when not in use.</li>
    <li> Was a little bigger than I expected and magnification was not as good as my previous mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the lighting as well.&lt;br /&gt;I can put on my makeup and watch tv in the left mirror as I do it! LOL</li>
    <li> This mirror before I installed lights next to my vanity was a life saver I love the different lighting settings and will still turn it on to check what I would look like in different lighting. Really good for travel as well.</li>
    <li> Not big enough for me.  I guess I have a big face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying this is the 1st lighted make up mirror I have ever had so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too but I still can review it &amp; tell you what I think. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it takes a little getting use to using it at 1st. I hated it at 1st because it took up so much space &amp; two of the light settings might as well not even be on there because they are so gaudy looking. So I waited over a month to write a review &amp; I did get use to to it &amp; like it very much. It is bright enough for me (I also turn on the bedroom light while using it). I don&#x27;t get why anyone would say it&#x27;s not bright enough because as the title of my review states, you can see every little blemish, unwanted hair, &amp; uneven skin spots on you&#x27;re face but hey, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for, was just a little scary at 1st (lol). I personally don&#x27;t use the side mirrors &amp; wish they weren&#x27;t there as they just take up space (but some may like them). Out of the 4 settings I use 2. Day &amp; Home. \\&quot;Office\\&quot; looks hideous &amp; yellow &amp; \\&quot;Evening\\&quot; is just too dark for me. It also comes with an outlet on the base to plug a curling iron in which I really like. So far everything works correctly. Just if you don&#x27;t need those side mirrors, get one without because it&#x27;s a space grabber.</li>
    <li> This mirror allows me to see very very close up for fine hair.  The lights help a great deal also.  As we age adjustments have to be made and this is a great helper.  It is easy to use.  There is a plain mirror + a close up mirror + lights for very good visuals.  I haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet, but this is what I had in mind for the dark motel rooms.  I consider this worth the price. The only thing I would change would be the plastic leg that holds the mirror up...I would have made that metal also.  It is plastic and may not be as durable for travel.  I will check it out.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy the magnified mirror and lighting selection. It functions to my best advantage. It&#x27;s compact and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: Would like to see some texture of something on the front doors since they look plain.</li>
    <li> Please does anyone make a make-up mirror with enough lite, this one was the same, dim lighting. I had to send it back and keep looking.</li>
    <li> This mirror may be not as stylish as metal brushed oval mirrors, but it is 200 % more practical. The lighting is very effective. You can swivel the mirror around for either the regular side, or the magnified side. Easy to clean. It is very light weight as opposed to metal mirrors. Have had it for a year now, and still works perfectly. The tube lights on the side don&#x27;t heat up, which is nice. The side mirrors help you check out the back of your hair. A solid buy if you want your make-up to look flawless, maybe less so if you just want a pretty mirror sitting on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update september 2011&lt;br /&gt;although i like the mirror, the lights burned out after a year.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one at bed,bath, and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;make sure to turn off the lights when not in use</li>
    <li> Purchased for our daughter for Christmas &amp; she LOVED the different lighting settings. I&#x27;ve had the same brand/model myself for 15 years &amp; it still works. She always begged me for it now she has one of her own. Great price!</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these mirrors within the last year and have wound up throwing them both in the trash!  The bulbs or the switch (or both) goes out in about two months.  You cannot replace the bulbs and it just isn&#x27;t worth the trouble to send it back to the manufacturer for repair.  Bad product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, does all as expected, great deal for price!  Really can&#x27;t understand negative reviews.... either they are not working it right (read the instructions, much?), or they expect a thousand dollar item for this price.</li>
    <li> I was really dissappointed with the performance of the magnifying mirror.  The images are distorted to the point of causing headache. The other mirrors were fine.</li>
    <li> My daughter has owned a mirror exactly like this one for 15 years and I liked it so much that she bought me one for Christmas. Shortly after Christmas the mirror she had for sooo many years finally started to give out so I bought her another one exactly the same. Stick with what works best! This make-up mirror is excellent and well worth the money spent. No other mirrors out there can compare to this one!</li>
    <li> I had the older model of this mirror and I just purchased this new one because my old one died and over 15 years of use! LOL! Not bad for a make-up mirror. I love how the center mirror goes up and down versus side to side. A must for me! The lights are bright on this, but you can change the settings. Would definitely recommend this! I&#x27;m hoping that this one lasts me 15+ years as well!</li>
    <li> Good lighting, positions well for doing make-up.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for one week.  I thought it was going to be great, then I went to turn it on and the lights do not work anymore.  I am very disappointed and do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The make up mirror is great!  I love the different light settings.  The 5x magnification makes it easy to put contacts in it fits nicely on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  Very cheap and flimsy design.  The left light worked for about 2 minutes then stopped working. JUNK!</li>
    <li> My wife loved this gift. She uses it daily, as it has a stand and several lighting settings as she applies her makeup.</li>
    <li> This product is very light in weight. When you plug in your hair dryer or curling iron it will fall forward. With cords today you have that extra big box to plug into the outlet on the front of the mirror.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new lighted mirror.  The lighting is great (even better than my old Clairol).  And...there&#x27;s no \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; - which was a complaint on another brand of mirror.  My only improvement would be to skip the side mirrors and make the main mirror a little larger.</li>
    <li> The magnifying mirror on this is so distorted &amp; wavy it looks like you are looking into a circus fun house mirror. I returned it immediatly.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find a make-up mirror that has an outlet on it, it makes it nice to be able to plug in your curling iron. You can not find this product in the stores anywhere. Very nicely packed, fast shipping. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I am not sure whether the item I received was defective or not, but the florescent lights on either side of the mirror flickered intensely.  The 4 \\&quot;color-correct\\&quot; light setting are really just filters: clear, green, lavender and pink.  They are in no way accurate, or even suggestive, portrayals of the types of lighting (day, office, evening, and home) they are meant to replicate.  This mirror is cheaply made and flimsy.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> My 40+ year old eyes needed the magnification and the extra bright lights so I could see my eyelashes.  This fits the bill perfectly!</li>
    <li> The lighting is wonderful on this mirror.  I also like the different positions you can set the mirror in and how the mirror can tilt forwards and backwards.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product in-store, and thought I would get the same quality online, despite the discounted price.  I don&#x27;t know if the manufacturer sold off the rejects for discounted sale, but looking into the magnified side, is like viewing yourself in a mirror at the circus.  The uneveness of the magnification makes it impossible to use.  I had to purchase a small round mirror with suction cups which I have attached to the magnified side.  So basically, I purchased the Jerdon mirror to become a stand for a second mirror.</li>
    <li> I had a mirror like this and it broke so tried a couple that I found downtown and they just didn&#x27;t work well, bad lighting, this one works great.  I don&#x27;t mind the delayed time to turn on, as it is just seconds.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mirror and love it!  the light is great and the mirror is easy to move.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this product and purchased it with caution. I am so pleased with the mirror so far! The lighting is great and the size is perfect. The side mirrors stay in place well, and I really love all the different settings. I have not had any of the problems others listed with the lighting...you just have to hold the ON switch down for a couple seconds and then it shines very brightly. I have tried 3 different mirrors; the round and oval versions, but this is definitely my favorite. It reminds me of the kind my Grandma used growing up. Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Conair makeup mirror, but just got tired of buying the expensive replacement bulbs so I decided to buy this brand because I owned one years ago...I feel like I&#x27;m looking in a funhouse mirror the 5X magnification side is soooooo distorted...very dissatisfied</li>
    <li> This mirror is a nice mirror.  The light is so much brighter than the subdued lighting of the smaller versions in the stores.  The price on Amazon was almost $10.00 dollars cheaper than the same model mirror solded in other retail stores.  When I first turned on the light the left side flickered for a while.  After several uses it has stopped.  As long as they keep making these mirrors, when the need arises (which is usually every 5 years or so)I will buy the same model.</li>
    <li> After having a makeup mirror for 40 years.  The same one!  It no longer would switch to a different lighting.  So I ordered this one.  It was important to me that the mirror would swing top to bottom, and this one did.  But when I got it, it too was broken exactly like my old old mirror.  The company told me to just throw it away and they refunded me my money.  Don&#x27;t know if this is a normal operational problem, but I never had a chance to try it out.  I took my old one apart and worked on it, and got it working again.  Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without!  I really don&#x27;t live by that much, but it worked this time.</li>
    <li> Very disapointed in this Jerdon Tri-fold lighted mirrow. Worked fine for about 2 months, then all lights are not working!!</li>
    <li> Nice, compact, and convenient. One thing I didn&#x27;t notice when buying and surprised me upon receiving, was the built-in outlet that can take upto 1400W of power. This is convenient when blow drying and styling my hair.</li>
    <li> You can actually see by the light on this mirror unlike many I have tried before.  Great item.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money - the mirror distorts your image depending on how close/far you are to it and is not large enough to frame ones whole face.  The side panels are useless - if you use them to see the side of your face you can&#x27;t put your make-up on as they get in the way.  I bought this because I had a conair and couldn&#x27;t find replacement bulbs - I am going to look harder for those bulbs now.</li>
    <li> Used to be found in Linen &#x27;N Things where I live now no longer carried. Alot better price than they had or could find in any retail store locally! Works great, fast shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> While other reviews showed some negative comments about failing to light properly, I found this product to be excellent and working well after 6 months so far.</li>
    <li> I had an old Clairol lighted mirror that finally died and couldn&#x27;t find anything similar until I read a review on this mirror.  I was not disappointed.  I ordered it and am very pleased.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hate to write this but I got this mirror on November 5, 2012 (2nd one: see explan. later). It is now July 25 of 2013 as I write this. This mirror was originally great, I didn&#x27;t have to hold the button down long at all and it was nice and bright. Now, almost 9 months later, the right bulb barely even has a glow in it. It wasn&#x27;t a slow burnout, just all of a sudden one day. I am very handy so I decided to take it apart and see if I could just order a replacement bulb somewhere. The mirror warns on the back, \\&quot;do not open - no user serviceable parts inside\\&quot;. I figure I can get it back together, and save the time, effort and money of trying to return it and ship it back...AGAIN.... ( yes, the first day I received the first one, it wasn&#x27;t working correctly, so I sent that one back immediately since I still had the box). This is actually my number TWO of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back-side screws are hidden under the flat white plastic discs inserted on the back to hide them - they look like a permanent part but they pry out fairly easily. I don&#x27;t know if I can get the slider that changes the lighting effects colors to hook back up again ( I always use it on the brightest setting so not impt to me to try very long), but as long as there are 2 bulbs in it (even if one doesn&#x27;t work, at least one may work as mine is now - if 2 bulbs aren&#x27;t in it, it wont work at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken pics and measurements of the approximately 8-7/8\\&quot; 2-pin single linear tube fluorescent bulb that says \\&quot;CH Lighting F6T5/CW\\&quot; to start looking for replacement bulbs before putting it back in so I can at least use 1 side&#x27;s light. It is a tricky-take-apart as they warn. The bulbs&#x27; pins fit into metal \\&quot;pin clasps\\&quot; and I got them back in with some very delicate &amp; patient prying. If I find replacements, I will see if Amazon will let me post more info here. If not, I&#x27;m looking at specialty lighting stores in my area. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d rather just buy a different kind of mirror if I can&#x27;t find the bulbs, I bet they wont take it back, esp after this long and that I have messed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is a shame that this had to happen, I was really liking this mirror. My last Clairol mirror last at least 12-15 years or more, shame things are built to break sooner now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#UPDATE: I emailed the pictures of the bulb and description/measurements and 2 specialty lighting stores have the bulbs in stock for under $6.00 each, and within 15 miles of me. I hope this helps someone else. So many poor people have bitten the bullet and believed the lucky peoples&#x27; positive reviews. I thought I was one of them. Now I just feel lucky I can fix it myself!ulbs, I bet they wont take it back, esp after this long and that I have messed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is a shame that this had to happen, I was really liking this mirror.

    <li> I always liked this type of set up, even though I tried a different type when my old-time one first broke. What a mistake! I came crying back for this type. You can see every pore because the lighting is great. The other newer types of mirrors leave you wondering if you even found your lips with the dark lighting. I&#x27;m never changing from this type again.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. I have owned many over the years. I love this one because it has an outlet for my hair dryer, which is very helpful when traveling and outlets are hard to come by. My only issue...I wish that I could replace the bulbs! The other issue...over time the &amp;#34;kick-stand&amp;#34; in the back tends to break (for me). In any case, I have one that I use everyday and I keep a brand new one under my bed...ready to go, so I am never without this mirror! I&#x27;d be lost putting my make-up on without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably owned 3 lighted makeup mirrors in my entire lifetime and I&#x27;m almost 50.  The other 2 lasted for many, many years.  This quit working properly after 6 months.  The bulbs flicker and then shut off.  I treated it well, never dropped it....there is no reasonable excuse for this to happen.  I&#x27;m moving on to the Ott Lite mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is fantastic. It has a magnified mirror on the reverse. You can at least put this on a table and do your &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; and not have to stand in front of the bathroom mirror to do it.</li>
    <li> This is very nice and the lights are great for doing makeup</li>
    <li> I had to write a review because this mirror really sucks. This mirror is not even white is beige and it is very cheap. The light is not useful at all to do make up in a room that is not well lit. I am returning this product tomorrow. The light stopped working a few days later and i only used it like 3 times.</li>
    <li> Steven S. Showers, I cannot thank you enough! I had all the same problems as everyone else (flickering for a while, then both bulbs stopped working) and I was firmly on the list of product detractors. But I followed your instructions from March 27 and now it works as good as new! For some reason the act of taking it apart made it work again. Strange but true. Thanks so much for your thoughtful review!! As a convenience, I&#x27;ve copied Steven&#x27;s instructions into this review, below.&lt;br /&gt;_____________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you take the Jerdon Model JGL9W apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT TRY TO PRY IT APART! That will NEVER work. I tried that. That is some tough plastic. I found out that the back is not made to simply pop off. And no amount of prying will get it off. The unit is held together by four (4) rather substantial screws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where are the screws? On the back of the unit you will see four (4) round slightly recessed areas. The recessed plastic inside of these four circles hides the screw heads. If you take a medium size phillips screw driver and press it into the center of that circle you should penetrate through the 1/16 inch or so of the covering plastic, and find the screw head right underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I used the word \\&quot;if\\&quot; and \\&quot;should\\&quot; because I removed the plastic with a 5/16 inch forstner bit on my drill press, not knowing what was under there. I thought it was a support post, internally glued, and I was going to separate it from the back by removing the plastic material around it. But, to my surprise, the drill bit hit metal quickly, and in that way I found the screw head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Before you seperate the front and the back of the unit, use the flat end of a screw driver to pop out the slider knob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that caveat, when you get those four screws out, the unit comes apart easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I take it apart? This unit worked fine for one year, and 11 months, wherein, it came to pass, that both of the lights stopped working. Even if you held the switch down for a minute the lights would not light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because both lights would not light, I figured it was probably not an issue with the lights themselves. I thought I might find something wrong with the switch. When I had the unit apart, and I plugged it in, I operated the switch, and it had a different feel to it, it clicked on, and it clicked off. Before I took the unit apart, the switch had no such mechanical feedback. I am not sure what I did to invoke that change in behavior. Nevertheless, I was rewarded for my efforts, as is often the case in situations like this, where you make the effort, but you are not sure exactly what you did to make it work, but by golly, both the lights come on now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, if I had not broken one of the small brackets that holds one end of one of the lense movement assemblies during my effort to pry the unit apart with a big screwdriver, I could simply put it back together and give it back to my mom, as the lights appears to work fine now. But because of this broken bracket issue I need to figure out how to glue it back on before I can put it back together. I don&#x27;t see a major problem there. (Update: that was no problem. I made a new bracket, glued it on, and the unit is reassembled and functioning properly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking inside this unit, I must report to you, that it is well made, and quite substantial. I think people who buy this unit are getting a good deal. All electrical connections are made with solid crimp connections, and everything is well insulated. The ballast transformer looks to be so substantial that one might expect it to last for a century or more. And the lense movement assemblies are quite cleverly and substantially designed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who want to know how to change the fluorescent light bulbs in this unit, i.e. if they ever did fail, well then, you would take the unit apart as described above. Beyond that,the rest is speculation on my part derived from looking at the issue from the inside. As noted I did not need to replace the bulbs in this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the case, on a label close to the bulbs, it tells you what kind of bulb you need. However, the bulbs do not have sockets. They are hard wired in there with crimp connectors. To remove the old bulb or bulbs, you would have to clip the wires close to the bulb pins, remove the old bulbs, and put in the new ones, and then crimp the wires back onto the pins of the new bulb. I suppose you could solder the wires on, using some shrink wrap insulation to make sure that there is no bare metal showing after you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a person to accomplish this successfully, you would need to have some electrical knowledge before hand. Not a lot, but some. Like don&#x27;t work on the unit while it&#x27;s plugged in. And how to crimp, or solder, and how to insulate the bulb pin connections. And how to keep track of where the wires go. You could take a digital photo first, before you disconnect anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the replacement of the light bulbs would be further complicated by the fact that these light bulbs are mounted inside of the lens movement mechanisms. It appears that the main mounting bracket (one per side) for the lens movement mechanism must be unscrewed and moved at least partially out of the way before you can get your hands on the phenolic strips which serve as the mounting structure for the bulbs, and through which the pins extend. I poked around in there and tried to see how these might come out. It is not clear. It Looks like somewhat of a mechanical puzzle. And when it comes to the lens movement mechanism, we are speaking about a string driven spring loaded apparatus, and it will take some mechanical aptitude to get it put back together and properly realigned, that is tracking from side to side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(To adjust tracking, you need to relieve the string tension on one side, and spin the lens into the proper position. I needed to do this before I put this unit back together.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the light bulbs in this unit is not impossible. But it would NOT be considered easy. Apart from the time it would take to find the right replacement bulbs, and have them at hand ready to install, I think you would be talking about a couple of hours of shop time, factoring in the time you will need to explore and fathom just how to get the old bulbs out of there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A factory technician who has done this a hundred times, who has the bulbs, the tools, and the experience, might be able to complete the job in about fifteen minutes. A person who sees the inside of this unit for the first time will take longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are electrically and mechanically inclined, and have the time to spare, it might be an enjoyable project, which would pay some dividends, I think, in terms of making the end-user very happy. Giving new life to an old friend will certainly give her something to smile about.de. As noted I did not need to replace the bulbs in this unit.

    <li> I would highly recommend it.  it has great magnification, light and folds neatly and can be tucked away in small space</li>
    <li> Bought the first of March 2011, failed today July 30, 2011. Do the math. Lights began to flicker and then just quit working. There is apparently no way to replace the bulbs. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror as a gift on March 1 and it totally died out 2 weeks ago. Holding the on switch down doesn&#x27;t make any sense because the switch is \\&quot;down\\&quot; once you turn the mirror on. Replacing the bulbs is a joke as you&#x27;re suppose to get an electrician to do the job? I&#x27;ve had many mirror over the years that have broken due to the glass or frame but never had this problem. What a huge waste of money and it&#x27;s only been 5 months. I hate this disposable attitude that so many companies are coming up with. This has to be my first and biggest disappointment with Amazon and one of their products. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this mirror to anyone. I&#x27;m sure someone out there has one and it working perfect...not me!!!</li>
    <li> I like it but it seems like the one bulb is brighter than the other. I am hoping that this does not get worse over time. I was extremely happy with this product until it started doing that. I tried flipping the switch on a off multiple times. No difference. One bulb is still brighter than the other.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 1 month and used it 3 times and it shorted out and filled my room with smoke.</li>
    <li> Comparing this to the Conair that I sent back this is 100% better!  The mirror flips from side to side which adds stability to it staying in place when turned in angled direction.  Lights are brighter then the Conair.  Also has a plug for hair dryer or curling iron in unit.  Love this!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on its reviews, but it is just okay. The shipping was quick, and it was packed well. The biggest problem is that the light is not bright, even on daylight setting. The light is adjusted by colored filters moving across the bulbs, but they are not lined up well. So, when daylight is selected, I can see green bars along the edges of light. Additionally, part of the stand on the back is made of flimsy plastic and represents a very weak, unstable base that could easily break. Finally, a small thing, but the side doors only close when the unmagnified mirror-side is facing out. It&#x27;s an annoying thing to have to keep flipping the mirror over in order to close the doors. Overall, I would not recommend this mirror if you are the least bit visioned-challenged. It simply is not bright enough.</li>
    <li> I bought  this mirror and it worked ok for about 9 months until one day it just stopped working.  I contacted the manufacturer and they quickly replaced it with a new one.  I have now had the new one for about 4 months and today it stopped working also.  I have had another mirror by Clairol that worked for years and years with no problems.  I would never buy a mirror by Jerdon again!!  Save your time and money and purchase a different mirror.</li>
    <li> Works just like my old one.</li>
    <li> Awesome product... My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> Had the item a little past a month,the lights burned out and are not replaceable. Since it was beyond the 30 day return period could not return for a refund. Do not buy this brand. I have since bought an Ott brand,very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lighted mirror for my chick as a Christmas gift, and overall I&#x27;d say it was a good value.  She&#x27;s pretty happy with it overall, though I think the only complaint might be that the on-board lights are a little dim, and the plastic and shade control knob feels a little cheap.  If you put these considerations up against the cost it works out as a fairly good value.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement  make up mirror and I like it better btha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror  is excellent.  I have had  several  and this is the best.</li>
    <li> The description of the item was exactly as described, service was excellent. Item was shipped immediately, arrived without damage. Was most defineltly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Roger</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror just over 1 year ago and both bulbs are now out.  It wasn&#x27;t bright enough for me to begin with, but now it is going in the trash, since I need a lighted mirror.  I&#x27;ve tried holding down the &#x27;on&#x27; button as other reviewers have advised.  I&#x27;m not sure how that would make a difference, since it is a toggle switch, but I gave it a try - no luck.</li>
    <li> I am so glad none of the stores in my city had any makeup mirrors I wanted and was forced to go online to find just the right one. I love everything about this mirror: the size, the ability to adjust the  slant, the lighting, and yes... even the 5X magnification. There are no blind or blurry spots whatsoever on either mirror side. There is even an outlet for a curling iron or other styling tool built into the front of the mirror. Highly recommend ! I could not be any happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Received promptly and my kother is delighted with it. Very clear mirror and good quality light of various hues.</li>
    <li> My daughter had been looking for one of these so I bought it as a gift for her.  The price was great on Amazon--I paid way less than I would&#x27;ve at a beauty store (I know, I looked!!).  She loves it and uses is everyday.</li>
    <li> This mirror works fine and is perfectly suited for my daughter&#x27;s make-up table.  Perfect size, easy to use.  She likes it very much.</li>
    <li> It works fine, has adjustments for day, night, office, etc. Not too big either. I did read if the bulbs blow (They should last forever) you have to send it back to the manufactor or have a professional replace the bulbs, for the price of the mirror, if the bulbs blow, I will throw it away and buy another.</li>
    <li> What I didn&#x27;t expect when I set up this mirror is to see all the fine hairs I missed around my eyebrows, and the fine lines I didn&#x27;t know I had.  Really.  It&#x27;s a great l mirror &amp; light that helps me see things I didn&#x27;t even know were there.  (Not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad?)</li>
    <li> I had one of these mirrors for a couple of years, and I consistently had problems with the lights.  They would flicker, sometimes take a long time to come fully on, etc.  I love the tri-fold style and magnification, though, so when mine died I researched, read lots of reviews, and decided to try it again.  Big mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time the lights flickered for 3 days then died completely.  The packaging contained a polite little notice that fluctuating currents in home electricity can cause flickering, but somehow every other light in my house manages just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this mirror is great, so if you don&#x27;t care about having lights it&#x27;s wonderful.  But I DO care about having lights.  I just wish Jerdon would figure out their lighting because their designs are great -- and somehow every other electrical appliance, large or small, manages to handle the &amp;#34;fluctuating currents.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was replacing an old Clairol mirror that I got in high school.  I had read the other reviews and decided to give this one a try.  It&#x27;s not as bright as my old mirror and the center mirror is not as big, but I do like the side mirror format.  It folds up nicely to fit in a drawer.  No problems with the light, you just have to hold the button in like my old one.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Recieved this mirror on September 12, 2011 and on October 12, 2011 the right bulb is dull and flickering.  Will try to do as another reviewer and check on replacement, but of course I will have no mirror in the mean time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for the bulb issue, I would really like this mirror. Couldn&#x27;t be more bummed.</li>
    <li> I was unhappy to see that it is not white as pictured here, which is a nice attractive clean white color, but is rather a dingy sort of cream, as best I can put it.  Which does not go with the room it is in; also it has a very lightweight &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;-ish look, and the lighting, when it is lit, seems very muted and off-colored to me. Finally, and this is my fault, I am sure: it looks much smaller in person than I had wanted as an ample area to put on make-up, possibly use the tri-fold to glance at the side/rear of one&#x27;s hair-do, etc; but it is really a very; small surface on the sides and middle surfaces.  I say my fault on the size question, because I probably should have sought out the measurements and checked it against what I was imagining, but it looked like  just the ticket for my 18-yr-old&#x27;s new vanity station in her bedroom, and for mine as well, and it was not what I was hoping for.  I would like to return it -- just need to go through the process.  Unfortunately, I perhaps too impulsively bought two of them -- one for my daughter and one for me, so I will need to return both.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as listed. this lighted makeup mirror is the perfect size for a dorm room or small vanity.It also folds so that it remains compact and out of the way when not in use.</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase for a Jerdon Tri-fold mirror. I loved the one I had but someone dropped it and broke the Lights.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought of buying a different brand. It is the only one I could find with a place to plug something in. Love it!!</li>
    <li> All the girls in the family are going to want this, including me (I gave mine to my son&#x27;s fiance for her birthday, and she hopped up and down like a bunny for a few minutes -- and she&#x27;s 33).  This might be the hit gift of the year.</li>
    <li> Lights stopped working 17 days after the 30 day return policy.  Item was used less than a dozen times.  Risky expenditure.  I buy from Amazon all the time. Very disappointed in this &amp;#34;Best Seller&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Mirror is six months old.  One bulb went dull and will not flicker back to life.  This should have lasted me for years.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this and ordered despite many not so favorable reviews.  The first thing I noted was that the mirror is very small.  It does tilt which makes it easier to see, but still it was difficult to see my whole face good.  The next thing was the lights. Switching between the settings was difficult and I was afraid I was going to break it.  I tried the daylight first and it was TERRIBLE!  The \\&quot;daylight\\&quot; light lit up my face in a very unnatural way.  It was like the light lit up the center of my face bright but cast dark shadows around the sides if that makes sense.  I used to put on my makeup directly in front of a natural window and can tell you this \\&quot;daylight\\&quot; setting was NO WHERE near realistic.  Unfortunately it only got worse from there.  The \\&quot;work\\&quot; literally turned my whole face green, the \\&quot;night\\&quot; turned me dark pink and the \\&quot;home\\&quot; turned me light pink.  I asked my husband,  thinking perhaps I was being too critical.  He took one look at all the different light settings and agreed that it seemed cheap and impossible to even sit in front of it with the bright lights for more than a minute, let alone put on makeup and look good!  His first words were \\&quot;send it back- it&#x27;s junk!\\&quot;. So, all in all, I am sending this back tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I had owned a mirror for a couple of years just like this. Same style. Same Company, Jerdon. Well one day it just died. We would leave that thing on for hours at a time some nights. Lasted through many hours daily. So I decided to buy the same one again. It came in the mail and the only difference was the light switch. I used to have to hold mine down till the lights came on. The new one just goes on with one flip . That was great. The bad thing was it started blinking the first day. So Amazon sent me a new one. We have had the new one for some time now and it is great. The other one was a lemon. This one is perfect. I would never get a different one because the lights on this are very bright which i need when applying my eye makeup. My husband even uses it to cut his mustache!!! I would highly recommend this mirror, and would definitely by this brand again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a makeup mirror in a long time but this one is absolutly great. I has all different lighting which works great. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The lever for changing the light filters was very hard to move. It was so still that the lever&#x27;s handle fell off in my hand. Returned this item for credit.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my son&#x27;s girlfriend, she is very pleased with it and uses it daily. Lighting and mirror description is accurate, I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> One of the light bulbs burned a few days after the 30-day return policy and cannot be replaced.  Basically I paid $30 to use it for 30 days!  Buy if you only need to use it for a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> i had left my mirror home when we left for vacation . could not go 3 months without it. have had the first one for more than 3 months. now i have 2. wonderful</li>
    <li> First one was messed up, 10 stars for Amazon, it was outside of the 30 day return but they took it back anyway and overnighted me another one, all without ever touching my account.  I love Amazon.  Second one was fine with no issues.</li>
    <li> This mirror tends to fall out of it&#x27;s adjustable support.  I have had to put a sheet of rubber under the support in order to keep it from collapsing.</li>
    <li> Our first mirror did not light properly so we had it replaced.. No problems in doing so and our current mirror is terrific.  Although there are several lighting selections to choose from we only use one and it is perfect for our use.</li>
    <li> I loved the mirror but after only four months one of the lights stopped working and it cannot be replaced because the unit is glued instead of screwed together.  It was past the time where Amazon would allow a return so I am stuck with it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Reminded me of when I was younger</li>
    <li> still good quality. easy-to-use like old time yes I still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Was awkward! Took up to much room on my vanity! Sent it back! But product itself was okay!</li>
    <li> I also have this mirror with light bulb problems.  I have the paperwork that came with it and there is a section about replacement bulbs.  It says not to attempt to change it but to \\&quot;send us your mirror and we will service it for you\\&quot;.  Does anyone have any idea where to send it to??</li>
    <li> Jerdon JGL9W Tri-Fold Lighted Mirror - Fluorescent bulb on left side is dull while the bulb on right side is bright.  Purchased this item in February and I am very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this lighted mirror in Dec 2010 so we got about 18mos out of the lamps.  I found the review by Kathy (pasted below) really helpful in replacing the lamps.  She provided info which is hard to find on the web. However, it wasn&#x27;t quite as easy as she suggests so here&#x27;s a few more tips.  Use a pointed tool to pick the screw covers out of their seats.  The plastic case will open after the screws are removed BUT the halves will still be held together by the sliding switch for the color filter which is spring loaded.  Pry the plastic slider/switch off to separate the case halves.  At this point wires will still attach the halves but the halves can be folded flat on a work surface.  The wires to each end of the lamp slide off with help of needle-nose pliers.  The insulator/board bulb-mount can be removed by pushing the plastic tab away near the top.  I paid about $9/lamp at Home Depot so the $19 total repair cost versus new is questionable.  I think it&#x27;s designed to be a throw-away item given the repair effort.  The design engineer should be ashamed of his work.&lt;br /&gt;************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;5.0 out of 5 stars I replaced the tubes!, March 22, 2012&lt;br /&gt;By Kathy (Maple Valley, WA) - See all my reviews&lt;br /&gt;This review is from: Jerdon Classic JGL9W Lighted Tri-fold Mirror, 5x Magnification (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;I really like this tri-fold mirror, and was very unhappy when, after a little more than 1 year, the lights burned out. And even unhappier when I learned that I would have to send this to the manufacturer for them to replace the lights. Really? No, I don&#x27;t believe I will do that. I was hopeful that by holding the on button down for 10 seconds as suggested by another reviewer would work, but the light is definitely burned out. I was not pleased with the selection of lighted make-up mirrors at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, which is where I originally purchased this mirror. So, I figured this was useless without the lights anyway, I may as well open it up to see if I could replace the lights. On the back of the mirror case, there are 4 indentations that cover the screws, and once you pop them out, the screw heads are visible. Unscrew with a philip&#x27;s head driver, but be careful when you take the back off to prevent damaging the light filter. I never used the variable lighting, only the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting, so I just removed the rotating lenses to access the tube. The tubes are easily removed by pulling the copper connections off. The florescent tube replacement is F6T5/CW (CW is for cool white, brighter than soft white). I paid $6.19 for each tube. Plug in the tubes, close the unit, and screw it together, and voila! You have a great make-up mirror.without the lights anyway, I may as well open it up to see if I could replace the lights.

    <li> Has many uses....very versatile in positions and visability.  Overall quality is 90%...with a average product being 70%.  The lights could be a little brighter, but we are older and everything seems dark to us. Compact and being nice is a plus as well. Would buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Wife says 4 Stars Plus on this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Jerdon Tri-fold Lighted Mirror in April 2006. I tried it right away and it lit up fine. I knew you needed to hold down the button for at least five seconds to get it to light. I maybe used it 3 more times and all of a sudden the lights would not come on any more. They flicker and seem like they will come on, but no luck. Who needs that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the magnification and the tri-fold mirror. So I have it set up in front of a window and I can see fine without the lights, but it&#x27;s useless during the night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to order the Conair. I suggest you do the same.</li>
    <li> This is a great bargan ! Its a large mirror. The day light setting is the best and only one you need . I barely noticed a slight noise . Ive paid the same price for a simple round fake chrome round mirror on a stand at Wallmarts . You just hold the button down a bit and the light comes on .</li>
    <li> I ordered this vanity mirror for my daughter for her college dorm room.  She tells me it&#x27;s not as bright as the one we have at home.  Aside from that, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have had a lighted makeup mirror for years and can&#x27;t imagine not having one, so when one of the lights started to go out I began my search for another.  I came across this mirror and started reading the reviews.  I was concerned because the price was soooo good that I thought that it was too good to be true.  I almost did not buy it when I read that the lights were difficult or at times did not turn on but I threw caution to the wind as there seemed to be far more positives,  and I&#x27;m glad I did!  I will say that when I first set it up I could not get the lights to come on and felt a sick feeling but I held the button down for a second or two then released it and tapped it again and we had lights!  And wonderful bright lights they are (kind of scary) I guess I really needed this mirror a while ago ;-).  I love the stand and the different positions but I really like that the mirror swivels vertically instead of horizontally thus letting me adjust it even more.  The 5X magnification is clear and really great for doing my eyebrows.  As far as the side mirrors, I haven&#x27;t really used those yet (my other did not have them) and that&#x27;s not to say that in time I won&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m just not used to them.  My only concern is that I don&#x27;t have a problem with the lights a month from now, so I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.  I absolutely love everything about this mirror and I would buy it again and I think that it&#x27;s worth giving it a try!</li>
    <li> RETURNED.....  This mirror is terrible. It is cheap, plastic and junky!!!!!!. On the website the description and picture made it seem amazing, Why I could not wait to recieve the mirror and use it.  It is awful.</li>
    <li> Extremely nice but I find the magnified side a tiny bit distorted.  Still, I would buy it again for the lighting choices and I just &#x27;got used to&#x27; the magnified side.  Better than any other I have had.</li>
    <li> The mirrors were fine...however, the lighting was very poor!  Much too bright and unnatural.  My old lighted mirror which the lighting&lt;br /&gt;Shopped working ....after about 20 years .... had more natural lighting!  The lighting could be adjusted.....but Very disappointed in this one!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just getting old, but the lights on all the settings seemed to be pretty dim.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very nice product.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter as a gift, she say it works great , it must because she now leaves mine alone. I like the way it lights up,  the different night, day and other light settings and the fact you can see the profile.  Very nice</li>
    <li> Great makeup mirror and easy to pack for travel if needed.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my mom!  She needed a magnification and this is wonderful!!  She loves it!  Would recommend for self or as gift.</li>
    <li> I do like the side mirrors, but the light is just really poor.  If I were you, I&#x27;d keep looking.  I am.</li>
    <li> Hubby had cataract surgery in one eye and thus had to switch to a contact for the other.  He was having a lot of trouble learning to get them in and out, so I got him this for Christmas.  He&#x27;s been using it almost 6 months and it has GREATLY improved his ability to get the contact in and out daily.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for.  With age you need a little extra magnification to apply your make up and this is the one that helps.</li>
    <li> O.k. this is my second update.  After I wrote the last update I contacted the company and they were great.  They sent me a new mirror in about 1 day (don&#x27;t know how that happened but I got it the next day (but they are only in the next state)).  Anyway, the new mirror works fine and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  So I do recommend this mirror after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just adding an update to my prior review.  About two weeks ago, the light started flickering when I turned the mirror on - eventualy the light stops flickering, but even so, it&#x27;s not as bright as it was.  The right bulb looks about ready to blow out - the top 1/5th is not lit.  I tried to return it, but the &#x27;return window&#x27; is over and I couldn&#x27;t find a number to call to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to warn would-be buyers.  I&#x27;ll stick with stores like Costco next time that have a better return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my prior review.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this mirror about 1 month ago and have used it daily since.  I am very happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s not quite as large as it looks in the pics, but it&#x27;s still a very nice size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had lighted make-up mirrors for a very long time.  I would rate this the best for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I keep it propped open on a dressing table.  I think it is very sturdy.  As I recall, the piece that props the mirror up is the most flimsy (in other models) and one of the first things to go.  This feels solid and there are two pieces used to prop it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The lighting is very good.  You have the ability to choose Day, Home, etc., but I generally only ever use Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  I especially like the fact that it has two side mirrors so you get to see the parts of you that you never see (and maybe never want to see:)).  I&#x27;ve had compliments lately on how I look and I think it&#x27;s because I apply better make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The reverse side of the mirror has 5X magnification, and it likewise is a very good mirror - not distorting as I sometimes find magnification mirrors to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the other reviews before purchasing but I don&#x27;t find some of them to be true.  The light turns on with a switch very easily; you don&#x27;t have to press and hold.  I&#x27;ve seen that in other models but not this one.  Perhaps the manufacturer improved the product since the first reviews were written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone.  I believe it is a quality product and I think it will last - it&#x27;s sturdy, solid and seems to be made of good materials (not flimsy).of the other reviews before purchasing but I don&#x27;t find some of them to be true.

    <li> After reading a ton of reviews on different mirrors, I decided to go with this one. I&#x27;m glad I did! It&#x27;s definitely brighter than my other mirror I got from Revlon. I can use it with very little lighting in the room. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the different color selections for the lighting - I haven&#x27;t really found it useful. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good mirror.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one i have purchased...using it almost everyday. the mirrors are very clear, i am very satisfied with it, also the extra outlet come in handy.</li>
    <li> I think this mirror is great for it&#x27;s magnification qualities, but it does fall short in the brightness of the light.  I thought I could use the light without having my bright bathroom lights on but that is not the case.  If you are looking for a mirror with a bright light this is not the one for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to give negative reviews, but this mirror is awful. Although it has an adjustment to slant, the adjustment is too much between each (so either straight up or way back). The folding side mirrors do not open far enough and the lighting is poor.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY 3RD ONE OVER THE YEARS...IT IS SO EASY TO USE...LOVE THE MAGNIFIED SIDE FOR CLOSE UP EYE MAKE UP APPLICATIONS...THE SIDE MIRRORS WORK GREAT WHEN BLOWING OUT MY HAIR...</li>
    <li> I loved this product so much I brought 3 more for gifts for my friends. I can see clearly without my glasses every detail of my face.</li>
    <li> I have had my mirror for about 1 month and have enjoyed having it. I like the fact that it has an plug on the front so I can plug my curling iron up. It is compact and easily able to be taken on a trip. My only complaints are that the lights seems funny to me. It has the standing day,office,evening, home settings, but it doesnt seems to go all the way over into the day position. so the lenses aren&#x27;t the same on both sides (one is green and the other purple). Now maybe it&#x27;s intended to do this, but I am suspicious that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not b/c I can&#x27;t get the switch all the way over to \\&quot;day\\&quot;. My other complaint is that the side mirrors seem too small-but hey it&#x27;s portable so what can I expect- I can&#x27;t take a giant vanity set with me on vacation. I would purchase it again still. It serves my beautificaiton needs:-)</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping the light settings would be brighter than ones I&#x27;ve found at local stores.  I like the tri-fold &amp; the magnified mirror, it&#x27;s just not bright enough to see well enough to do my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Oct. 1, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My husband replaced the light bulbs Yay!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 25, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Its only been 5 months since I purchased my 2nd Jerdon mirror and now one of the light bulb is already starting to flicker. What a bummer because I really love this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;My husband bought a replacement light bulbs for my old one he said he figured out how to replace it. I actually kept my other Jerdon mirror as a backup so I guess I will be using that one after my husband install the new replacement light bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd mirror of this style. The first 1 I had was a different brand and I had it for at least 5 yrs. then the light bulb went out and its very hard to replace it. So I bought a new one Jerdon brand, loved it too but the light bulb died after 6 months of regular use (in the AM when I&#x27;m getting ready for work and in PM when I&#x27;m cleaning my face b4 bed) I&#x27;m so disappointed. I don&#x27;t know if i will buy this brand name again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cave and bought another Jerdon mirror, I hope this one will last longer than my 2nd one at least couple of yrs longer and I would be happy.</li>
    <li> bulbs blew after 4 months, can not get into back to replace.  NO technical support.  Waste of money, very upset</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews on this mirror we bought this as a gift for my mother in law; her old make up mirror was held together with duct tape and she bought a replacement but it wasn&#x27;t a Jerdon and the quality just wasnt there so she went back to using her duct tape mirror.  We gave this to her for Christmas and you&#x27;d think we gave her a million bucks.</li>
    <li> gave product four stars to be fair as don&#x27;t know if it was product or operator but didn&#x27;t find this product visible, or useable</li>
    <li> I really needed a mirror with plug in, so this works.  Everything was great with the purchase, except that the light shades that change for day, evening, etc. doesn&#x27;t work.  It is okay for me, because it does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> The stand broke on me but still happy. Would buy again. Love the extra outlet I can connect my curling iron to the mirror. Very convenient</li>
    <li> Would buy again if needed. Would also tell a friend to buy. Was just like the picture. Received in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror about a 1 year and a 1/2 ago.  After a year the lights began to flicker like strobe lights.  Finally, it stopped working.  I figured the bulbs needed replacing.  Much to my dismay, I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement bulbs!  They don&#x27;t make them!!  What a scam!  I threw the mirror out and I will never buy another one again.  I don&#x27;t care how many rave reviews this product gets.</li>
    <li> At least the mirrors are good,  the electrical cord seems a bit more sturdier than the previous makeup mirror that I had and the lighting is adequate. However, the plastic is CHEAP but then again you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PSSST!  This product is made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it does the job, but as soon as it gives up, it&#x27;s gone. I would not buy another Jerdon mirror because of the cheap plastic housing.</li>
    <li> great mirror for the money</li>
    <li> Bought for wife. She loves it for trips.</li>
    <li> I bought this item from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, in Jan of 2011 it is now May 2011, and the lights don&#x27;t work at all, like others I had a hard time trying to figure out how to get the bulbs out.  Since I bought this at the store I never read any reveiws before hand.  I was going to replace it until I read the more recent reveiws which explained how to get the back off, it was difficult at first but I soon got the hang of it.  Like others I did break something (the slider) but I don&#x27;t use it anyway, so that being said I can now replace the bulbs myself.  Now I don&#x27;t need to throw the mirror away or replace it.  I only gave it 3 stars because it should have been easier to replace bulbs.</li>
    <li> Great for all purposes. The changing light setting is a really nice touch!</li>
    <li> I like that it will flip vertically rather than horizontally. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really was looking forward to receiving this!!! I hadn&#x27;t had one since High School!!! It was just fabulous-----THE 1ST TIME I TURNED IT ON!!  Then it was done!  LIGHTS OUT!! What a tease! I am returning and asking for another, in hopes of getting a good one!  If I get the same results, I&#x27;ll try a different one!  If you got a good one...hang on to it!  I did ask Amazon to test the next one before shipping, so ...I guess, we&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the extra plug in capability in front of mirror.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mirror for a week now and it is serving my needs just fine.  The lights aren&#x27;t super bright but bright enough.  I like the side mirrors a lot.  It&#x27;s very versitile.</li>
    <li> My initial impression was, \\&quot;Wow, this is heavy\\&quot;... as I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a heavy box. I looked at it briefly before wrapping it up for Christmas and initially noticed irregular seam gaps between the front and back case pieces. I figured, oh well... it&#x27;s only $35 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to mid-January and my wife really likes it. She was previously just using an oval mirror with a table lamp behind it. I purchased this for her because it seemed like the lighting and mirror setup she had before was inefficient. The light output of this unit is very bright and the ability to tune the color temperature pretty helpful. I&#x27;ve seen other units (Years ago, my stepmother had a very advanced one) that actually turned on different color-corrected bulbs. She had no issues with turning the unit on after I showed her she needed to briefly hold down the ON button to get the ballast to charge. (Thanks to other reviews posted here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: The unit is WELL WORTH the price and despite looking like it&#x27;s of sub-standard quality, it seems great to us.</li>
    <li> This Jerdon lighted makeup mirror works very well. As was mentioned in previous reviews, it is necessary to hold the ON button down for a slow count of 8, then release, for the lights to come on. Unlike the instructions printed on the product, the lights on mine do not flicker before coming on. This mirror replaces a similar product by Windmere that I had used for 15 years. The Windmere mirror did not have the side folding mirrors, which I could do without. I wish Jerdon also made this product without the side mirrors.  Also, I need to hang the mirror on the wall, so had to tape the metal stand in an upward position and use it to hook on a picture hanger.</li>
    <li> This is a lighted make-up mirror that should be taken off the market. It has a glider that is suppose to allow different shades of light, but presumably a manufacturing flaw disallows it to \\&quot;day\\&quot; and \\&quot;office\\&quot; setting. A metal bar behind it, stops it from moving to the left. The phone number of the manufacturer, Jerdon, in the brocure, is incorrect. I reached a number of a citizen who says he in inundated with calls of people trying to reach Jerdon, complaining about the very same thing. I e-mailed them, gave them all the information they needed to research and they replied they needed additional information to research it. I finally returned the product.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 because Yes I love it The light is not that accurate ): i found it hard to see my make up but it is so close to real light</li>
    <li> I had one of these I bought at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, but my little puppy was running in my room &amp; caught the cord , so it went flying &amp; broke.  I really like this product, but didn&#x27;t want to pay 50 bucks again, so I looked online &amp; here it was for less.  Exactly the same product as before &amp; works just as good.  Now if I could keep my puppy from catching the cord......</li>
    <li> I purchase the JERDON mirror from the customer reviews.  It has too much glare for my household lighting. The mirror was not functional. The casing was great and the stand was a little flemsy.  No matter what lighting I switch to on the mirror (it has five)the floresuent lighting caused too much glare. And just forget about the maginification. That was horrible.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to replace one I had that you can no longer get bulbs for.  It was a Conair.  I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews but I must say this mirror is great.  I have no problem with it lighting and the magnification is really good.  I cannot see up close as I am in that age bracket.  With this mirror I can put on make-up without glasses.  The maginifaction allows me to do things where I needed to use glasses before even though the mirror I had did magnify it was not enough.  I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> DOESNT STAND LIKE I WANT IT</li>
    <li> Everything and more. It works beautifully. Exactly what the description was and a lot more. Easy to use and lighting is perfect.</li>
    <li> The area that serves as my makeup desk is very dark and this provides more than enough light . Great quality, low price!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to buy this mirror because of a bad review that is posted.  I bought it anyway because the price was much cheaper than the Clairol one that I was looking at.  It&#x27;s a sturdy and attractive mirror.  Only complaint-it could be a little larger and the light a tad brighter.  It is nice mirror at a good price and great for doing makeup and plucking eyebrows.</li>
    <li> When a similar make-up mirrow that I had had for years finally died on me last year, I went out searching for a replacement.  I tried the new style oval ones.  They were just awful.  The mirror was too small and the lighting was depressing.  Then I found this one.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  You get a decent sized front mirror and two side mirrors that are especially helpful to someone like me who is very myopic.  The lighting somehow manages to be extremely flattering (which helps you feel better about yourself) while at the same time shows everything you need to see and possibly alter a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry about the reviewer who had a problem with the lights, but that was probably just something that went wrong with one mirror.  Mine is a treasure and infinitely superior to the newer style ones out there today.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! Although only the day and office lightings work. Can&#x27;t get the switch to the other settings which is super disappointing. Any help here?!</li>
    <li> Flashback to the 70/80s.  Wonderful</li>
    <li> Cheesy construction and lag time for the lights, I can live with. However, the four settings are controlled by a slider, and the slider won&#x27;t move to the \\&quot;Daytime\\&quot; setting. Something inside the case is blocking its movement; looking through the slit, it looks like there&#x27;s a piece of metal there. The case cannot be opened so it&#x27;s impossible to get in there and see whether it can be fixed. (AND it was a gift, ordered more than 30 days ago, so Amazon won&#x27;t let me exchange the defective item for another one. Augh!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be satisfied with the one you get, if your expectations of quality aren&#x27;t high, but personally, I wouldn&#x27;t risk it again.</li>
    <li> I finally found a makeup mirror that really works for me.  Excellent product at a very good price.</li>
    <li> I love the tri-fold much better than the single mirror- it really lets you see stray hairs, blemishes, etc. I am more than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;3/08/11- Editing to say- just bought another one when my first one died after 3 years of daily use. I can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup mirror I&#x27;ve found. The light is bright enough and the 5X mirror is just enough to see what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;ve found that most lighted makeup mirrors don&#x27;t have a bright enough light, but this one does!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this item but bought it anyway.  Big mistake!!  The light worked fine for about a month, then I had trouble turning it on.  It would take 3 - 5 minutes to get both bulbs to light so it would stay on.  I have now had this mirror 4 months and it won&#x27;t light.  Since it has a 1 year warranty, I tried calling the customer service number to return it.  Guess what - THE NUMBER WAS DISCONNECTED!!  So the 1 year warranty is worthless.  I ended up buying a new mirror at Walmart.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS MIRROR!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!!!! The best light mirror I have ever owned. HIghly recommend this to any one looking for a good mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome. I ordered one for me and one for a friend. The magnetic side of the mirror was a rude awakening when I first checked myself out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I can now sit in bed and place this mirror on my bedside table to do my make up. Would purchase again, and recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. You can see your whole face even in the magnify section and the side mirrors give you a true reflection. I was worried when I saw how small the box was but after unwrapping it, I was glad I bought it. It tucks away neatly and sits</li>
    <li> I love the mirror -- but the first one I received did not work.  The second one worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> This Jerdon makeup mirror is just as bright as Clairol&#x27;s True-To-Light makeup mirror which was discontinued years ago.  It&#x27;s sturdy and magnification is not distorted.  The popular oval mirrors out today don&#x27;t compare in brightness or value for the price.  Recommending this to anyone who was a fan of the Clairol mirror.  The power button works by pressing and holding down for just a few seconds until the bulbs start to glow; which is typical of fluorescent type of bulbs, and totally normal (worked the same way on the discontinued Clairol True-To-Light).</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for the price.  It is hard to find the fold out type mirrors anymore and I love this one.</li>
    <li> Read reviews over and over/many times. Finally bought it. Just like other people mentioned, I held the button down until the lights turned on the 1st time. After that, I only push the button down briefly and the lights come on! Wow! They come on quickly, so, I&#x27;m wondering if they are different types of lightbulbs? I&#x27;m not complaining! lol! 5X magnification is excellent!!!</li>
    <li> Love the tri fold and 5xs magnification, most mirrors do not either.  Very clear, just have to wait a few seconds for the on switch.</li>
    <li> This mirror is so nice. It is under-rated. The price is unbelievable, and I got super saver shipping! I would advise people to give it a try if they are looking for this kind of mirror. I love it.</li>
    <li> Once again when I can&#x27;t find a product, it is at Amazon!  This mirror is perfect for makeup, with four light selection, just like the one I used for over 20 years. I have put it on my home office desk for daily use, the closed panels and front plug are pluses.</li>
    <li> I had an old Windmere that finally bit the dust since I couldn&#x27;t find replacement bulbs.  So after the last one went out I decided to go to Walmart to find another one.  I had no idea it would be such a chore to find a decent make-up mirror.  I bought several and for Pete&#x27;s sake I couldn&#x27;t see myself.  I&#x27;m not sure if the lighting was supposed to be for the midnight hour but it sure is hard to get a straight line of eyeliner when you can&#x27;t even see your own face.  So anyway, I bought this one and although it&#x27;s not quite as bright as my Windmere (R.I.P.) I can at least recognize myself. So of all the lighted mirrors I tried this one meets my satisfaction.  I just use the daylight setting and it works fine.  The other settings remind me of Happy Hour lighting at the senior center.  Hopefully it will last long enough that I&#x27;ll eventually need that.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This mirror was great while it lasted - which was 3 short months! I bought it in February and it stopped working in June. BOOOO!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it everyday! I really like that there is an outlet on the front of it, I can plug in my hair straightener! The light settings are kind of weird, but that&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t think the light settings are \\&quot;real\\&quot;, like the day setting, etc. For the money, this is perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this light for six months. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the light it gave off, but it was sufficient.  I was putting my makeup on today, and the darn thing started to flicker.  I turned the light off, and turned it back on, and nothing.  I did that a few times, and the light managed to come on for a few flickering seconds, just to go off again.  I asked my husband to look at it and he informed me of the warning on the back not to open it as there are no serviceable parts inside.  Oh brother, I expected this light to last for several years.  There is nothing I can do to fix it, so in the trash it will go.  The majority of the reviews were good, so I took a chance.  I&#x27;m really disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I chose this mirror because of the magnification on on e side and regular mirror on the other side. Its a great mirror and I love it. I love the folding doors that protect the mirror and the lights. Its nice to get something of quality when your not sure what you are buying. I say this because I have never heard of the Jerdon brand before so I wasn&#x27;t sure how good it was going to be. But the quality of the product is fantastic so I&#x27;m VERY PLEASED that I took a chance on something that I didn&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s what inspired me to write this review for everyone. I read reviews before I buy anything and hope to see the kind of information that I&#x27;m putting here on them. Another thing I love about this mirror is that its very well made. It is durable and not made of cheap plastic parts that look like they will break after a few uses. This mirror is sturdy and looks like it will last me many years to come. Overall I&#x27;m giving this a five star rating !!! I suggest anyone reading this buy this mirror. For the best price it&#x27;s also the best quality thing out there !!!</li>
    <li> My last lighted mirror had a switch that required holding the button down in order to start, but this model does not. I know some of the reviews are about holding the switch in the \\&quot;on position\\&quot; but they have changed it to just an \\&quot;on and off\\&quot; switch, at least on the mirror that I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that I have had with this mirror is that the lights flicker and dance like crazy when you first turn them on. I was about to return it but after leaving the lights on for about 30 minutes they settled down and worked properly. After the first time you use the mirror the lights only flicker slightly for the first few minutes then smooth out and all is well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that is different from my last one is that the mirror flips from top to bottom instead of side to side when you switch to the magnified side. I don&#x27;t like that because I always tilted the mirror slightly to one side to get more light on the eyebrow that I was working on. Plus you must always flip the mirror to the unmagnified side in order to shut the side mirrors when you are finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights are bright and the mirror magnification is great. I would buy it again even with these minor annoyances.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror after reading all the reviews, good and bad, thinking I could always return it if I didn&#x27;t like it.  After I took it out of the packaging, I set it up on my vanity and turned it on.  There was no problem whatsoever with the lights, and the mirror&#x27;s size and versatility is just right for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;The lights are not very powerful, so don&#x27;t expect too much unless you have your face close to the mirror.</li>
    <li> Used this to replace one I have had for 30 years. I hope this one last for the next 30</li>
    <li> Call Jerdon, they will send reasonably priced replacement bulbs.  Note:  you have to pop out the four small covers over holes on the back to get to the screws to take it apart.</li>
    <li> I had one of these mirrors for years and years and think that this mirror will last just as long.  It&#x27;s very nice and is just as described.</li>
    <li> Have loved the conair tri fold makep mirrors since I was a child. My last one lasted over 10 years!!!! What a great product, and all I had to do was call them to order new light bulbs for it every couple of years &amp; they came promptly. Finally it saw its last days, but it served me well &amp; I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was money well spent.  I have been using a makeup mirror for over ten years and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve found.  It has great lighting and the side mirrors that fold closed are an added bonus.  I would absolutely recommend this mirror and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost as bright as my old Clariol mirror (none of the new mirrors are as bright as those early versions) and works perfectly.  It&#x27;s also a good buy at 29.99.</li>
    <li> works very nicely and arrived quickly too!</li>
    <li> Getting use to this mirror was a little bit of a change for me, as I am use to using a large dresser mirror for applying my makeup. Once you get use to it though, you can&#x27;t ever go back to using anything else.</li>
    <li> Light burned out quickly, and it looks as if the replacement is not possible of the bulbs.  no too happy</li>
    <li> I used to have a Clairol mirror that I loved, but after years of use, it finally stopped working. Since it is no longer made, I decided to try the Jerdon mirror. I love this mirror. It is very bright, and I have no trouble getting the lights to come on. Just hold the button for a second--no problem. Anyone who is used to the old Clairol mirrors will love this one even more. I am going to buy my daughters each one for Chrismas. This is the brightest make-up mirror I have found.</li>
    <li> First of all I love to read the reviews and look at the pictures. It helps make online shopping so much easier to know what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;This morning my husband and I had a discussion about mirrors. I just turned 55, just got my first pair of real, full-time, long overdue, eyeglasses to replace those reading glasses I have lived in denial with for so long. For a little makeover I got a new hairstyle and, with my new hair and glasses look, I now want to spruce myself up and start wearing makeup more often again too. I discovered though, that you couldn&#x27;t wear the glasses and apply eye makeup.  So I was back to where I was before, not caring about putting on makeup because I simply can&#x27;t see to apply it. I mentioned, to hubby, I now needed a magnifying mirror.&lt;br /&gt;This got started when my husband was looking for a hand-held mirror (for another, non-grooming reason) this morning. At that time I also remembered that back in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s, my mom had given me a, variable lighted, standup, swiveling, magnifying, makeup mirror, similar to this style. I think it was a GE brand. I loved it. They were a popular item back then. Today it seems they are hard to find, with only a few models made anymore. I had lost track of that mirror and hadn&#x27;t thought about needing another makeup mirror until now, 40 years later!&lt;br /&gt;The real clincher was that hubby also said he&#x27;d always thought it would be great to have a mirror for shaving. (I&#x27;m not sure whether he meant tilting or magnifying or both? Yes, of course, we have a regular mirror on the wall we have always used!)&lt;br /&gt;I hunted this mirror down on Amazon and the price was right with free shipping. I looked at the Conair model (Conair also has one without the side mirrors). A reviewer mentioned a Jilbere brand. I looked at those too. The Jilbere&#x27;s were more expensive and the Conair could be had for about $9 less than this Jerdon one. But reviewers convinced me that the Jerdon was better lit. I&#x27;m not sure hubby ever considered or knew about mirrors being lit at all, but when he sees it, I know he&#x27;s going to be a stickler about the lights being bright enough for him.  I also know, at my age, how I&#x27;d like nice bright lights too. This made the little bit of extra money for better lighting well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I also read a review of the Conair (somewhere, maybe not even Amazon) that complained that the center mirror swivel should be horizontal to tilt without having to adjust the mirror stand, and not vertical. I suppose you can look at it both ways though. The Conair is adjustable horizontally on the mirror stand AND swivels vertically. Maybe the dual action, even if a little more inconvenient, is a plus for you. I opted though, through reading the Jerdon reviews, and the picture showing the horizontal tilt (very helpful), that this made more sense. The Jilbere appears to swivel vertically. (My old GE swiveled vertically, as I remember, and I vaguely recall thinking it wasn&#x27;t my favorite feature to have to adjust the stand for the horizontal tilt.) I figured the vertical angle views could be adjusted enough for my needs on the side panels. Although the side panels are not magnified (side panels are not magnified on any models at all) this still seemed like the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;Pictures of it in different views, especially the closed up view, also revealed that it was styled with clean lines that hubby would like and wouldn&#x27;t seem like too much of a feminine appliance.&lt;br /&gt;I have to laugh though. Hubby indicated a round standing mirror with his hands when talking about it. Oh my, I looked at the hundreds of those babies that are available now. My personal opinion of them is that even the nicest ones look like a chintzy little utility tool item (albeit handy) that was made in China and you got from Fingerhut. The mirror floating in space (but necessarily supported by some apparatus) style just turns me off. There are a few modern looking rectangle, freestanding and wall mounted jobs but they are always more expensive than they I&#x27;d care to pay and, in my minds eye, don&#x27;t look a whole lot different than the little round ones. No matter how they dress it up they just look like a time worn, antiquated (albeit handy!) design. It&#x27;s sort of like a toaster. There&#x27;s not much you can do with a toaster that makes it so significantly modernized and updated that it doesn&#x27;t still look much like any toaster that was made 50 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;In reality even the cheapest unlit round ones are ridiculously priced for such small little viewing areas. Forget the designer lit ones with fancy frame and base finishes. They run in the hundreds of dollars! Unbelievable! I also read that the lights are often specialized and irreplaceable. They are often battery operated, no thanks. Features like dimming, color change, or an outlet on the base, wall mounting brackets ect... make the itty-bitty things incredibly pricey. Give me a makeup mirror that looks like an official appliance and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, instead of a cheap looking tool that cost more than my microwave oven! Maybe hubby didn&#x27;t know they had these big mirrors. I did because I remember my one from the good old days. He&#x27;s going to love it!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and many thanks to the reviewer that explained about holding the light switch a few seconds. It doesn&#x27;t bother me to do that and, if I remember correctly, I think I had to hold the switch on my old GE mirror too. One of the first upfront reviews I looked at was the one about the bulbs burning out but the other reviewer, favorably clearing up the mystery, eased my mind. Great piece of advice, instead of thinking the bulbs don&#x27;t work. When I got the thing I did spot the note right above the button, explaining the holding of the switch also. Some people never read labels though.&lt;br /&gt;My next challenge is that those stupid little round mirrors would have fit much better on my tiny little bathroom vanity countertop a whole lot better than this rig, but I&#x27;ll make it work somehow. After all you can close it up and store it, and those little round ones are pretty much destined to sit on the vanity top all the time.ays more expensive than they I&#x27;d care to pay and, in my minds eye, don&#x27;t look a whole lot different than the little round ones. No matter how they dress it up they just look like a time worn, antiquated (albeit handy!) design. It&#x27;s sort of like a toaster.

Maybe hubby didn&#x27;t know they had these big mirrors. I did because I remember my one from the good old days. He&#x27;s going to love it!   Oh, and many thanks to the reviewer that explained about holding the light switch a few seconds. It doesn&#x27;t bother me to do that and, if I remember correctly, I think I had to hold the switch on my old GE mirror too. One of the first upfront reviews I looked at was the one about the bulbs burning out but the other reviewer, favorably clearing up the mystery, eased my mind. Great piece of advice, instead of thinking the bulbs don&#x27;t work. When I got the thing I did spot the note right above the button, explaining the holding of the switch also. Some people never read labels though.  My next challenge is that those stupid little round mirrors would have fit much better on my tiny little bathroom vanity countertop a whole lot better than this rig, but I&#x27;ll make it work somehow. After all you can close it up and store it, and those little round ones are pretty much destined to sit on the vanity top all the time.</li>
    <li> I think that this product is okay. The lights on the product are too small and therefore it does not have the ability to give off enough light that one needs to do there make-up. The magnification of the mirror is fine and the different selections for the type of light, such as day, office or night is great. But the only flaw that I find is the lights itself on the sides they are not bright enough.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror several months ago and use it every day.  I am very pleased with it.  The lights are bright enough to be able to see well in a pitch-dark room, the settings are perfect for getting rid of pesky shadows, and the magnification is just right to see every little detail.  I have not had any issue with the bulbs - they are still as bright and functional as they day I got the mirror (yes, you do have to hold down the &#x27;on&#x27; switch for a few seconds to pre-charge the bulbs).  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone seeking a lighted makeup mirror, either for a dark room or otherwise.</li>
    <li> What a bright change from the dimly lit lighted mirror I had been using! Too bad the local stores don&#x27;t carry this, but hurrah for Amazon, where one can find ANYTHING, and with free shipping to boot!</li>
    <li> The lights will not even come on anymore.  Neither lights are working after having it 1 (one) month!  I am VERY dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this mirror, which is sort of the problem.  When the lights burn out or a switch goes bad there is no way to replace either of them without destroying the whole thing.  She is on her 3rd one in 3 years!  If I can find one that is more maintenance friendly and acceptable to her I will not be ordering a 4th.</li>
    <li> Liked the outlet on the front to plug in blow dryer or straightener etc.&lt;br /&gt;Gives good lighting to face for applying make-up. Best value for the money of other ones that were compared.</li>
    <li> Very distorted, gave me headache looking into it!</li>
    <li> The lighting is a bit lacking and the magnification is pretty distorted from a reasonable distance but it will do for now.</li>
    <li> I was amazed how bright these lights were.  Great product for a great price!  So far, no problems.</li>
    <li> this is the best makeup mirror I&#x27;ve owned in 50 years.  I just wish the panels were a bit wider.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing investment and very much worth the money, the lighting is amazing along with the quality, and everything else!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  It makes putting makeup on a  breeze. I love the dual mirrors and the various light settings.</li>
    <li> We bought this mirror and within a few months it failed.  I managed to get it apart, after figuring out the screw heads were covered plastic caps to hide them.  I messed around with the switch and the bulb connections. It appears that the power switch is intermittent, if you switch in on and off several times it finally comes on.  The solution was to tape the switch on and use the plug as the switch. For the price they could make this so it lasts longer than a few months.  Buy the Vidal Sassoon version if you can find it!!!</li>
    <li> This item does not work it&#x27;s, it refects me but I know I look better than that. The light changing is ok but none of them can handle showing me as good as I look.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it. Would buy again. I looked forever for a lighted mirror in all the stores and they were either too expensive, small and didn&#x27;t have the two mirrored sides! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product has 2 florescent light bulbs, which one would not expect to last forever. Having said that, one would also expect to be able to replace them. Impossible without destroying the case, which cannot be opened. Was used about 4 times per week for ten minutes or so per day. Bulbs lasted about a year. Fair enough. Now have to throw the unit away, being unable ( by design) To replace them. Strongly advise that you purchase some other lighted mirror.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking my lighted mirror.  It is plenty light enough for me, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the on/off switch as some have so maybe the manufacturer has changed it.</li>
    <li> I had a Make Up mirror as a teenager well into my late 20&#x27;s  When it went I could not fine it again.&lt;br /&gt;I even took it to Jamaic with me in 1980.  I loved that mirror.  Now I found this one just like it with the outlet&lt;br /&gt;on the front.  It works just as good if not better.  I love the light settings and the maginification for my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Now at 55 I need a little more help seeing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror no complaints</li>
    <li> Great gift for my wife but soon after using it (next week) her hairdryer plug stuck in the AC plug and would never come out. It&#x27;s a great light but the plug is a bad design.</li>
    <li> As soon as we plugged in the mirror, the light flickered and went out.. Tried a few times, but can send for recycling now!</li>
    <li> Not the best lighting options (I prefer my sunlight lamp), but the mirror is pretty nice. Love that you can plug it in and not have to rely on batteries.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly.... No complaints whatsoever!!!! My three fold mirror is working just fine. The description was completely accurate. Satisfied customer</li>
    <li> So I read all the reviews, good and bad. My opinion of it is that its seriously an awesome mirror, and especially for the price. The mirror is two sides, one side is 5x magnified, good for tweezing my eyebrows and any small blemishes not easily seen, the other side is regular mirror and the side panels that open outwards have regular mirros. The different light setting are pretty cool, some of them are too greenish or blue, but the evening and the daylight lights are very nice. I like using the evening light for most of my stuff, even when doing my hair, it has a warmer more ambient glow, the daylight light is little brighter but still nice for accurate makeup application. The plug thats in the front for using like your blow dryer or flatiron come in handy, its very convenient and cool to have it there. The mirror has an adjustable backing, to how you want to angle it. Overall this is a verrrrry nice product, I recommend it. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks now and no problems. :)</li>
    <li> This mirror puts out a good amount of light and folds for easy storage.  The only way it could be better would be if it had a retractable cord.</li>
    <li> I like the side mirrors which is a feature my old mirror did not have. The mirror is aesthetically appealing and looks good with my other decor. The downsides to this mirror is that I find the magnification fuzzy and blurry. It is 5x so perhaps 4x or 4.5 x would have been better (I&#x27;m comparing it to an old mirror which brand I do not know). But the most frustrating part is the stand. The mirror has a flimsy bar with ridges and a silver frame is supposed to fit into a ridge to balance the mirror while it is standing. The bar is too flimsy and does not seem sturdy enough to hold the weight and size of he mirror. Thus it keeps popping out and falling flat. I&#x27;m afraid the mirror may crack with the incessant fallings over. I still have my old mirror but one of the bulbs is burnt out and I can&#x27;t find a replacement. :-(</li>
    <li> Very clear picture and adjusted easily for my needs</li>
    <li> I am digging this mirror! I have been using it all week (since I bought it) and using the different lighting settings and I really like the way that my makeup looks. The lights are bright and the mirror is very sturdy. It seems to be a classic design so I am hoping that it holds up like the classics always do.</li>
    <li> I have been using a mirror such as this one since I got handed-down my grandmother&#x27;s old Clairol model in my teens. From the 5 or 6 models I have owned (all manner of brands and price ranges) this one is by far the best. It is brighter, and manages to reduces the \\&quot;dark spots\\&quot; that are so common in mirrors like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewer previous, who stated that the trick is in holding the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button, was exactly correct. I can see where less-patient souls may claim that the bulbs are burnt out or that the appliance is defective. More than likely, it is an operator error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is sturdy and the adjustable angles are very helpful for using on various surfaces, such as when traveling. I will definitely look for this brand IF this mirror ever needs to be replaced.</li>
    <li> This mirror works well. You do have to hold down the power button for a few seconds for it to light up which is stated in the directions. No problems encountered with using it to date.</li>
    <li> The light is quite adequate and the regular mirror is fine but the magnifying mirror is all wavy, no good for much.</li>
    <li> Light settings really don&#x27;t change the lights much.&lt;br /&gt;Larger than I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
    <li> Definitely would NOT recommend this mirror. The slide at the bottom to change the lighting selections (office, daylight, etc) is very poorly designed. It did not want to slide. I did finally get it to slide to the right, but then it wouldn&#x27;t slide back to the left; it was permanently stuck.  I boxed it up &amp; returned it the same day I received it.</li>
    <li> I have had the Conair mirror and the former one no longer made by Clairol back in the day.. This mirror is EXCELLENT and surpasses both. The lighting is wonderful and really true.  The power \\&quot;on\\&quot; does take a sec to hold as others have said but that was like the old Clairol Mirrors too. The product is not cheap plastic but very solid and appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this item and recommend to any that are looking for a fine item.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday. It works very well and she loves it so much more than her old one.</li>
    <li> Great! Saves\\&quot;your in my way\\&quot;arguments. My wife loves it, and so do I!(well, cause she does). The only that would make it better is to have a clock in it! :)</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. The instructions that another reviewer gave about holding down the on switch until the lights flicker was right on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real problem with the mirror is that if there is any backlight at all, you get shadows on the mirror. The the glare of the lights while the mirror is reflecting the shadows makes it hard to see. If I didn&#x27;t have backlighting it would be perfect. As it is, I don&#x27;t think any other mirror would do better. And this was a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should note also that the plastic stand is a little flimsy. It doesn&#x27;t lock into position, just kind of rests there. So if you have animals or kids that are likely to bump it, store it flat, so that it doesn&#x27;t slam down and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror, love it!  If you&#x27;re looking to replace the Conair True Reflections II, this is the model you want.  My mom passed her used Conair down to me when my dad gave her a new one...I&#x27;d had it for years when one of the doors broke and couldn&#x27;t be fixed...I lived with it this way for many more years and finally decided I&#x27;d buy a new one for myself for my birthday.  WHAT!!??  They don&#x27;t make that Conair any more???  UGH! After some searching I found this one (hated the round models, hated the incandescent models), read lots of reviews, struggled with the idea of ordering this one sight unseen and shipping mirrors through the mail--EGADS!--what if the mirror broke in transit, then I&#x27;d have to send it back, etc...  Can I tell you how much I LOVE THIS MIRROR?!  It has slightly more magnification than the Conair model but it&#x27;s all the better to see you with my dear!  And the mirror pivots on the horizontal rather than vertical so it can be adjusted either by using the \\&quot;kick stand\\&quot; in the back or by adjusting the vertical tilt.  And the manufacturer has added a little sticker over the on/off switch for those who have no understanding/patience for florescent bulbs (see, I did read the reviews) but, if you recall, you had to hold down the on switch for the Conair as well.  Excellent price, Excellent product.  It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve been this satisfied with a mirror.  LOL, hope this helps you make your decision!</li>
    <li> Piece of crap!  The lighting capability failed 2 days after the return period passed. Now it&#x27;s useless and no return information can be found. I expected better from Amazon</li>
    <li> This is my third Jerdon make up mirror in about 15 years.  The light switch mechanism on my first two went out after about 7 or so years.  Just purchased a second and they changed the switch mechanism.  This should last even longer.  Like the 4 color settings and the 5x magnification.  I think any larger magnification would be impractical.  And, the price is extremely within reason.</li>
    <li> This was a bargain, had one before, lasted three years and now have new one.  Best mirror for the money!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, and the wife loves it.  it is exactly what the advertisement stated.</li>
    <li> I was very  apprehensive about trying a different kind of make-up mirror since I&#x27;ve only had Clairol&#x27;s for years.  This Jerdon Make-Up mirror is a godsend.  The magnification is so much better than any I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I would buy this mirror again in a heartbeat.  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these mirrors, 1 for myself and 1 for my mom. My mom is 58 yrs old, and her old mirror had recently died. She had searched for awhile for a new mirror, but complained that everything she saw didn&#x27;t have good enough lighting. Well, I bought this and she loves it. She says the lighting is great. As for reviews that said that the lightbulbs burn out fast, they&#x27;re wrong. You may have to hold the on switch down for a few extra seconds, but you had to do the same thing with the older mirrors that had great lighting too. I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror, and so is my mom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I bought these mirrors 2 yrs ago, and they both still work great! I haven&#x27;t needed to change a lightbulb in either of them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how different the lighting makes things look. This makeup mirror prepares you for all different lighting. Wish I had gotten this year&#x27;s ago. My daughter loves it too. Love the magnification side also helps with my face care and eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me so I don&#x27;t have to share my mirror at home now it&#x27;s on my vanity I had one almost like this one years ago pretty handy for me</li>
    <li> very cool i like it but i though that it was more small.. lol</li>
    <li> I shipped it back. It wasn&#x27;t an item for me. I didn&#x27;t like the different colored lightings. There wasn&#x27;t enough light.</li>
    <li> Makes putting on my makeup much easier. And I don&#x27;t seem to put on as much now that I can see what I&#x27;m doing! Thanks, Jerdon!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror - different settings, can close the mirror when not using, lights are bright and there&#x27;s an extra outlet to plug a blow dryer or curling iron into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the light bulbs go out and it&#x27;s almost impossible to replace. My husband, who is a mechanic by trade, cannot pry open the plastic casing. The plastic screens come off where the bulbs are but it&#x27;s impossible to get the bulbs out. I have searched online and cannot find anything other than prying the mirror apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give it one star because when the bulbs go, so does the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has an idea how to fix this, feel free to comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - my husband, the genius, figured it out (is he a genius for figuring out how to get the bulbs out? I think so). On the 4 corners of the back are plastic clips - sort of like little round covers - that cover the screws to open the mirror to change the bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEH! It&#x27;s sort of obvious, my husband keeps saying he should have known. Well, it&#x27;s a learning experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give it 3 stars because of this. I wound up getting a new mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my daughter, she received it before Christmas, as they will be visiting with us from Wisconsin…Brrrrrrr</li>
    <li> This was for our 13 year old daughter.  Works perfectly.  Can be angled, lights work good with filters, extra outlet, folds closed.  Hard to go wrong.  She does leave it on her desk so we do not have the issue with the support in the back without a place for it to go.  We feel we have gotten our monies worth with this.</li>
    <li> I found the center mirror was distroted.  got dizzy when looking into it.  Over all product was made well and it arrived on time and packaged well but I sent it back.</li>
    <li> What a blessing to finally throw out the old mirror.  The quality of this is unreal...top end product for a rock bottom price.  You just gotta get one of these, ladies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several makeup mirrors in my lifetime and this is hands down the best one I&#x27;ve ever bought. It is in the mid-range price, lightweight and easy to travel with. The four different lighting options are excellent.</li>
    <li> Purchased this awhile ago, and really like the trifold design, and the magnification.  I really wish their was a higher light setting, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> i needed it for hairstyling moreso than makeup . Havent actually used it for that yet , probably wwill at some point but it was suffiecient enough to see most angles of my head. The lighting plates arent too bad again for what I used them for. also the magnifying mirror is very decent</li>
    <li> If I could give this a negative minus one star I would. the lighting was TERRIBLE. and this was over the top expensive. I returned PRONTO.</li>
    <li> THIS MIRROR COME WITH THE PERFECT SETTING FOR MY NEED, IF I UNFOLD THE SIDE MIRROR, IT SET THE PERFECT ANGLES FOR MY USE. I WOULD RECOMMENDED FOR EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, who uses it constantly and loves it. Not only is it a lighted mirror, but it magnifies one&#x27;s face! She loves it, so I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace an old, broken Clairol True-to-Light mirror, &amp; it fits the bill perfectly..</li>
    <li> While some taters say the light is good, I find it&#x27;s dim.  It needs to be twice as bright especially in the daylight setting.</li>
    <li> Great mirror! I use it everyday and my makeup always comes out so flawlessly! No problems with the lights at all. It turns right on as soon as I flick the switch. I also ordered one for my mother who loved mines!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this mirror yet.  It is my &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; mirror, just in case my current mirror dies.  I hope it will work as good as the current one.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this mirror.  My husband loves it.  He needed something big, but not to big to use in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I purchased the mirror back in February after purchasing at least 3 different mirrors and then returning.  It is as close to my old mirror that lasted 20+ years.  However, recently the bulbs went out and they are virtually impossible to replace.  The company said they will replace them for a few of $18.00+ with a turnaround time of 5 to 7 days.  Shipping is on you.....  It is almost cheaper to purchase a new mirror.  Like my Mother always said &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t make them like they use to.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have ordered 2 of these and did not like either one...  Both were different in lighting.  Neither one was consistent in the workmanship of the product ..One of them felt like it was blinding me.  I already have one of these for a long time and will just keep using it till it dies!  They don&#x27;t make things like they used to!</li>
    <li> I really liked this mirror until the light bulbs burned out.  They are not replaceable so I suggest that one purchase another brand that you can replace burnt out bulbs.</li>
    <li> I had a mirror like this 30 years ago, but I don&#x27;t remember the brand.  I do remember, though, that the quality of BOTH sides of the mirror was perfect.  I just received this mirror today and I am SO disappointed.  The 5x side of the mirror is so distorted its like looking in a funhouse mirror.  Basically, that side is useless.  The rest of the mirror is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  The lights are not as bright as I was hoping and the plastic seems a bit cheap in construction.  I gave this 2 stars because if you are looking for a decent 1X makeup mirror and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, this will actually work.  But mine is going back because I really do want both sides of the mirror to be useful.  My search will continue...</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for my daughter-in-law.  She feels she needs to return it for a makeup mirror that can be wall mounted.  This one she would have to bend down to use on the bathroom sink counter.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because I have trouble putting on makeup without my glasses. I thought that this mirror would be great for me because of the 5X magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong, all I got was a distorted view of my face.  I have a round 5X magnification mirror that&#x27;s clear as a bell, but it&#x27;s small, and I can&#x27;t see my whole face.  Well now I know that NOT ALL MIRRORS ARE CREATED EQUAL.  Don&#x27;t buy it,it SUCKS.</li>
    <li> The mirror looked fine but the light switch wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed as this was sent as a birthday gift and had to be returned.  I would not try this brand again - it didn&#x27;t even rate 1 star.  The only good part of the whole deal was Amazon&#x27;s painless return policy and process.</li>
    <li> Wife thought this was a great gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the previous reviews kind of concerned me about the durability of this lighted mirror, but it has worked perfectly so far.  I&#x27;ll do an update if it craps out any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the little slider switch for different light settings is kind of gimmicky, but she thinks it&#x27;s neat, so there ya go!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom so she could see better.  She loves it.  The different lightings are great.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for the first two days then I had to hold the switch down a little longer each day for it to light.  Ultimately it stopped lighting completely within 2 weeks.  Returned for credit and Amazon was great as usual!</li>
    <li> There are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments.  I weighed both before I made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments.  I am glad I did.  The light from the mirror is bright, the slide bar for the different light settings works very well.  If you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time.  I enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but I am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out.</li>
    <li> Was looking to replace an old \\&quot;True to Light\\&quot; mirror without success- I have been to all of my local retail stores and was unable to find a suitable replacement.  This one has bright lighting and an extra outlet and is so much better than those smaller cirle mirrors that are popular right now.  Unlike other reviews, I&#x27;ve had no issues with the on button.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this exact make up mirror in the past and I loved it. That is why I got another one when my old one quit working. The problem is with the 5x magnifying mirror on the flip side. This is the feature I used to love. But the mirror on this one is messed up. I can&#x27;t focus or see without eyes hurting. The angle for the magnification is off and this side of the mirror is unusable. I wish I would have removed the mirror from my old one before I threw it out. I could have replaced it with the new bad mirror.</li>
    <li> Would have really liked this unit had it not been bad right out of the box. Would not light up at all.&lt;br /&gt;Got credit,  no problem.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as my original make-up mirror, which has been discontinued.  This provides good coverage and the lighting is good.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> Pretty good mirror. Not perfect. The lights could be brighter but, this is not the real problem. I worry about the stand . The stand is weak and the way it is attached it will break easily if you are not very careful. Magnification is good. I am overall happy but, not thrilled.</li>
    <li> My daughters love these. They received them for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I bought this 7 months ago.  It was great until the left bulb became dimmer.  To replace the bulbs sounds extremely complicated, so now I have to decide if I look into the &amp;#34;limited warranty&amp;#34; or put my electrician hat on and try to replace the bulbs.</li>
    <li> Does not offer top-quality magnification with top-quality liked the combination in my eyes is inferior my 50 each plus-year-old mom is unable to use it.</li>
    <li> The light only came on once and would not come on again.  Had to return it. Not the best quality.</li>
    <li> Purchased in January 2012 and stopped working January 2015.  Lights started flickering and/or not coming on.  Looked at instructions which stated that the mirror should be returned to the manufacturer to have the bulbs replaced.  I have owned several lighted mirrors which lasted several years, not 2-3. For this reason, I will not buy another Jerdon lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this makeup mirror .... Even though it&#x27;s kind of blinding due to the fact the light is superrrrr bright but overall I love it</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it all 5 stars was I like it so much I wish it were bigger for me to do my makeup.</li>
    <li> Great light..love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is not what I thought.  It&#x27;s big, bulky, heavy and doesn&#x27;t stay closed very well.  The lighting is less than optimal, too.  I would not recommend this</li>
    <li> It was better than I thought--good quality merchandise, very practical and yet has many perks with the different lightings.  More than pleased.</li>
    <li> Had one years ago which was the same style, but way better.  This one is not nearly as bright. But its for my 6 yr old so its not a big thing.</li>
    <li> Works great! The only thing is that the lights are not bright enough for me and some of them are not flattering lol but as long as you use another bright light in the room you should be able to see just fine. I&#x27;m just use to super bright makeup lights and these are much more dim than what I&#x27;m used to but I love the trifold mirror and the plug in located on it! It makes curling my hair so much faster!</li>
    <li> This is a really well-lit mirror.  It has different kinds of lighting:  one is for daytime, one is for office, one is for evening.  The two side wings of the mirror folds over onto the center mirror, keeping everything dust-free.  Also, the vertical angle of the mirror can be changed to suit your height or what the mirror is set on.  There are many choices for creating the angle that works for you.  I highly recommend this Lighted Mirror.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> its very bright and does take your eyes a few minutes to adjust to first thing in the morning, but very good product!</li>
    <li> Well worth waiting to find the right product. The different levels of light really help the girls get set for the day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife.  She is very happy with the light levels and reflectivity of the two mirrors. A necessary addition to her makeup table.</li>
    <li> I owned this same mirror previously and loved it.  Couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere in any local department stores.  Was thrilled when I found it on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This product offers me the lighting and magnification to help me look my best. I just love the convenience of it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I need it for and it came much faster than I had planned on. Lights are great and i love the plug outlet on the front of the item.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my wife and daughter.My wife said the lighting was just right for the daytime and nightime settings.Was much better than another product for lighting accuracy and clarity.</li>
    <li> one of the best things i have bought myself.  although it does magnify my face, it could magnify greater (and sometimes i need it to even though it would be more scary) but this is not so bad.  i normally keep it on the daylight setting when i am putting my makeup on.  I like the fact that I can tilt the middle mirror up or down.  the only downfall is the fact that I have to place it on something to put it up high enough so i can see into it because i stand at the kitchen counter while applying make up.  the lighting as a whole is much better in there.  i just wish my eyelashes were as long as they looked in the mirror once i finished applying mascara.</li>
    <li> Light stopped working on the 3rd week I got it . Im very disappointed! Don&#x27;t buy it not worth it!</li>
    <li> I had one of these as a teenager and wanted to replace it. So glad I chose this one!</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old mirror and chose this one because the mirror moved up and down. I have used it for several months and love it.</li>
    <li> Poor lighting and magnification is distorting, kind of like those mirrors in the funhouse at a carnival…..my Conair I had was much better and a clearer view on the magnification side.</li>
    <li> A replacement and frequently used.</li>
    <li> I use it daily and can&#x27;t believe I lived without it.  Great lighting system.</li>
    <li> This is your standard, run of the mill old-school makeup mirror. Not modern and stylish, but it *works*.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing on the shelf these days has any brightness to the bulbs. Unless you&#x27;re in a well lit room to start with, they&#x27;re pretty much useless. But these old-school mirrors are a million times brighter. You can see any clogged pore or stray hair. And you can see to blend out your makeup so you look airbrushed.&lt;br /&gt;These mirrors are big and heavy and clunky so taking them on vaca is a chore, but if your hotel lighting is wonky, it could be the difference between looking great and having people stare at your bad makeup job.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of travel mirrors and even super expensive lighted mirrors but always come back to these.&lt;br /&gt;This seller too is beyond fast! I ordered the night my old mirror burnt out, and had this by 10am the next day, standard UPS. Granted, I&#x27;m only 1state away, but that&#x27;s the fastest shipping I&#x27;ve ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend product and seller!!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;gone blind&amp;#34; I needed something to put on my makeup.  The glasses just didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is an excellent product, perfect size, perfect light (for day, night, evening, etc). One of my best acquisitions!</li>
    <li> Got one for me and one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I love mine!  Makes putting on my makeup so much easier!  I have a terribly laid out bathroom and I&#x27;m always back lit when I try to put on makeup in the morning.  The lights on this mirror are so powerful they override the brilliance of the sun behind me!  Now I can see what I&#x27;m doing.  No more guessing if I&#x27;m drawing my eyeliner straight.  I have no idea why I didn&#x27;t buy myself this mirror years ago.  Mom said she liked hers too. :)</li>
    <li> Nice, fair quality, and works as adevertized, perfect gift for a kid, which looks like it might last till they are teenagers.  Definetly consider this one, since it has no flaws, and is fun to play with.</li>
    <li> This product is poorly designed.  There&#x27;s a plastic lever that is supposed keep the mirror erect, but in reality is useless.  The mirror kept falling down.  When I attempted to put the mirror away, the plastic lever kept flopping down &amp; snagging things.  I, consequently, returned the product.</li>
    <li> My second one the first one lasted 4yrs! Swear by this product and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. She loves it</li>
    <li> This mirror works well and I use it every morning to apply my makeup. The cons of it are that it is kind of thick and bulky and it has to be plugged in instead of working with batteries. I also do not know what to do when the bulbs go out - I have read the other reviews and understand the it is very difficult to find the replacement bulbs. I will probably just buy a different mirror that is battery operated.</li>
    <li> Love it...does what I need it to do. My grand daughter love to play dress up with it. Will have to get them one when they are older.</li>
    <li> I purchased this makeup mirror because it most closely resembled my old one which apparently is no longer manufactured. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but does not measure up to the old one which finally wore out after years of use. The Jerdon is very light weight and tends to slide around on the counter. Also, the center mirror flips vertically rather than horizontally making it useless for side views. Other than that, the lighting is sufficient as long as it is on the brightest setting.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Excellent lighting!</li>
    <li> An oldy but a goody. It works great several years later!</li>
    <li> I really like the mirror.  It works very well.  The only downside is the mirror doesn&#x27;t hang on the wall which in my case would be more suitable.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed on my vanity to apply makeup and do my hair.The magnifying side helps with eye liner, as my contacts make it difficult to see close up.  I caught hubby using it too to trim his mustache!</li>
    <li> It replaced a make-up mirror that I have had for 20+ years.  It&#x27;s great to make it into the 21st century.  It is just as it was described and nothing was a disappointment.  I am very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> I just got this today and the lights don&#x27;t even turn on. The delivery is fast but I wish I could have started using the mirror already. :/ Emailed Jerdon about this and hopefully they respond soon.</li>
    <li> I took it out of the package and went to slide the slider to home setting and the plastic piece flew off and I still have yet seem to locate the tiny little piece that broke off.... The 5 Magnifying side works OK... not that wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is great! Nice and bright, affordable, and I love the light changing feature. I have horrible lighting in my house, and I can see my face clearly with this.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and a great product. Love this mirror, i had one for over 20 years and it got broke, so i had to replace it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a solution to living with several roommates and one bathroom. I turned my desk into pseudo-vanity. This is exactly what I wanted! The different light settings are great for indoor use, the mirrors can be easily tilted to where I need them to be, and there&#x27;s an outlet on the bottom right that is great for my curling or straightening iron! It&#x27;s pretty to look at and folds up nicely. When I&#x27;m not using this, I fold it up and lay it down - it draws no extra attention to itself. I have a lot of precision and clarity when applying makeup. It&#x27;s just a great product.</li>
    <li> Helps me a lot in the morning or when I&#x27;m going out, easier to see what I&#x27;m doing without standing up in the bathroom</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror because I already had what I thought was the SAME exact mirror.  However, this particular mirror has a major distortion problem on the magnification side.  I don&#x27;t know if the manufacturer made changes to  this model or if this is a defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of my other similar mirrors have this distortion problem.  I feel like I wasted the money I spent on this mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just what I was looking for. I like that you can move the larger mirror itself to an adjustment that suits you without having to adjust the entire mirror using the stand. The magnifying mirror is very good at enlarging your image. The cord is a little longer then the Conair brand which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things that I do not like though. The stand has no way of staying in place when you put it up to make it easier to store. The Conair  brand had small hooks in the plastic frame that lets you snap the stand in place when you want to place it in a cabinet between uses. Therefore when you want to store it, you have to wrap the cord around it so that both the metal and the plastic stands stay up.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the companies that make these products would take all these options into consideration when the make the items. It would make it more usable to the purchaser and salable to the company.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and is exactly what I needed with both a regular and magnifying mirror. Item was in good condition, packaged very securely.  It arrived on time too!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old makeup mirror which does still work, but is about 23 years old. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually true to light like my old one is, but it&#x27;s still very nice. I love that it has 3 mirrors and folds in to take up less space. The dual magnification is a bit odd but only because I wasn&#x27;t used to it. Now that I am I love it. I rec&#x27;d it in a timely manner and have not had any issues with the product or the seller. Would purchase from them again. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror for several years. I just bought another one for my daughter. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
    <li> Teen girls can never have too many mirrors, lights, and outlets.  This has it all and the added bonus of 5x magnification, the girls are in their glory.  I hope I never accidently look at it when it is at 5x magnification, I may shock myself.</li>
    <li> The magnification mirror is distorted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one if these before and really liked it. The only drawback is that you cannot change the light bulbs! Now that a little stupid if you ask me, but today everything is &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34;. Other than that, you can see way more of yourself than what you want too!</li>
    <li> I had a 15 year old sharper image mirror that still worked but was pretty beat up looking.  So I ordered this mirror to replace it.  I purchased it October 16, 2012.  it stopped working April 15th 2014.  I use it for 10 minutes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be no way to repair it.  I would not advise buying this one.</li>
    <li> I find that it falls over easily and that the light on it flickers quite a lot. My nanna had one like this when I was a child and I assummed if it was good enough for her I&#x27;d like it too but really its not worth it. The lighting settings are just odd and I find that my makeup can look garish if I go out into actual light.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected. The different light settings are not useful - at least not for me. The bright light is the only one that give enough light to see properly but my eyes are not great so maybe it is just me. I was hoping the 5x mag would be enough for tweezing and eyeliner application but it really does need to be stronger. The side mirrors are nice to have but not enough of a bonus to make up for the other issues. I also do not like that I cannot have it vertical at all. It has to be at a fairly steep angle to stay upright. If you are just looking for a make-up mirror with the vanity sides than this is a good item for you but if you really need the magnification then another item would be a better fit.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 as gifts and one of then stopped working already. I am very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last but a month with minimal use.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for years like the style would only make the magnification stronger. Would keep buying this  product.</li>
    <li> perfect for me. Thanks!</li>
    <li> So I have has this mirror for about a month. It works great! The lighting can be changed, and I can plug my straightener in to do my hair. Only complaint is that it can be magnified so much I see my imperfections. That isn&#x27;t a problem with the mirror- just my face.</li>
    <li> I am very nearsighted but can&#x27;t tweeze with my glasses on, and have had to wait for a nice sunny day, with the sun coming through the window at just the right angle and the mirror at just the right angle to tweeze what have become coarse, grey hair that now grows on my neck and chin (used to be black, so I guess grey is an improvement).  This mirror not only allows me to see whatever needs plucking any time, day or night, but also has a 120V plug-in on the front so I can style my hair sitting right at my table.  I&#x27;m really pleased - wish I&#x27;d had it 15 years ago.  Much more and better light than the old Clairol lighted makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> So wanted to like this item. The lighting was great and by far the brightest I have found. The first one of these I ordered arrived and straight out of the box I had a problem. The sliding mechanism  that changes the light  color was stuck.  After about thirty minutes of trying to figure out what was wrong, it suddenly started sliding, but the light color panels were a little off and not correctly aligned giving me a light that was mixed between settings. But because because I  was so happy with the brightness of the light I ordered another. Out of the box it was working  great and I was very happy with it. One month and one week later, the bulbs start flickering then go out, but when I turn it off then turn it  on they work for awhile then start flickering and go out again. One impaired product I can handle, it happens.  Two impaired products within a month of each other, it becomes a questionable product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in 2009, yes, five years ago. I intended to wait long enough to write a review, due to all of the mixed reviews, but then forgot about it until now. I use this every morning to put on my makeup, and it is still going strong. The lights are still nice and bright, and I have had no issues with this thing. Like other reviewers have said, you have to hold down the on button for a few seconds for it to turn on, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and hope to get several more years out of this.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  Although the lights failed after a couple of years with the first one, I still think it is absolutely worth the money.  My daughter and I used it daily.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this - another nice feature is the outlet on the front that we use all the time to plug in flat irons or blow dryers.  It is a very convenient feature.</li>
    <li> This mirror size is great. Being able to adjust the angle of the middle mirror is very handy and the double mirror doors are great for side angles. what i love about the doors is that they can be opened to any degree and stay open (they don&#x27;t just fall the a completely open position).  The mirror stand seems a little big flimsy but works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big downfall for me is the light the mirror emits. It has four different light settings (daytime, evening, home and office environments) which really do not resemble any of those environments. I wish it had just one really good light. I use my desk lamp as a substitute. I know that many have complained about the lighting system but if you are looking for a good mirror and don&#x27;t care about the lights (like me) this mirror is great.</li>
    <li> In spite of the &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; answer posted on the front page of this item, you cannot change the bulb yourself.  You SHOULD be able to... they are just simple florescent bulbs, but you need some special tool to remove the housing.  Instead you are instructed to mail the item to Richardson with a check for $15 to replace the bulb.  What a hassle.  I LIKED this mirror while it worked (about 2 years for me), hence the second star.  But to not be able to perform a simple light bulb change means this is going in the trash, and I&#x27;ll buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> I WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE WITHOUT HESITATION.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mirror that magnified and had regular mirrors. This one does, I also like the different light setting, office, day, night.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I had eye surgery and was having trouble seeing in my bathroom mirror.  The lighted mirror was just what  I  needed.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! The light is nice and bright and helps me complete my makeup flawlessly. So far haven&#x27;t had any problems with the light and am praying that I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update from the last review I did. It is now two years later from my initial purchase and I am still a satisfied customer, light still bright and still in condition. It is where I reside when I doing any makeup look. It gives me a nice clear and bright vision of myself so I can see any imperfections during my makeup application</li>
    <li> LOVE this mirror!! Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect with all aspects from putting on make up to doing my hair the light settings just right easy on and off buttons</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s plastic--I thought it would be sturdier. The magnifying mirror is such a large magnification that my eyes have trouble adjusting. I guess it does help to see where my lip liner is going.</li>
    <li> really like this product.  It works really good and light is perfect for all types of applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two, one was perfect, other mirror seemed blurry,</li>
    <li> My daughter borrowed my old makeup mirror and never returned it, this one is a great replacement.  I have not experienced off/on problems others have mentioned.  When I flip the switch it comes as expected.  It&#x27;s nice to put on my makeup in the lighting conditions I expect to be under while wearing the makeup.  I like the lighting options, while I have not used them all, I like having the option.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed and the pricing here is less than Walmart.</li>
    <li> For 25 years or more, I have been using a fantastic Jerdon lighted makeup mirror, so I had no hesitation in ordering this one.  What a BIG MISTAKE!.  There is no reason to buy this product.  The magnified side of the mirror is so distorted that my face looked grotesque, and the lever that changes the lighting \\&quot;might\\&quot; last a month of normal use.  Save yourself the frustration of returning this mirror by avoiding it all costs.  Jerdon......our relationship is OVER!</li>
    <li> A good price, easy tro use and the lighting is perfect for applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;If needed I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> It is great. Magnifies great. I received it as a gift. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned when I read some of the reviews of the mirror. I have had it for several weeks now and I have no complaints like those that I read about. The on off switch works with no problems. Like I said the mirror was a fantastic purchase.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative  similar to the Remington mirror I had for years and died on me. I couldn&#x27;t find that exact one so I settled for this. This mirror is a really good replacement. I&#x27;ve purchased other mirrors with very weak lights but this one mimics office florecent lights which was my main requirement. I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now and am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat disappointed with this mirror.  It is everything it was advertise, but:  It is very light and the mirror is not as crystal clear as I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth what I paid but not a penny more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will due until I replace it with something better.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  The illumination settings are done with a slider that scrolls a piece of colored plastic across the lamps.  The slider and plastic broke within 10 minutes of opening the box.</li>
    <li> All that I need!!..perfect for a perfect make up!</li>
    <li> hinges loosen and then the side mirrors are worthless. color changing slide bar is a bunch of hooey. plastic broke within 1 month. 10x mirror is warped and hard to use.</li>
    <li> I had a Clairol makeup mirror since the early 70&#x27;s. I never had to change the bulbs. The cleaning lady bumped it last week and the plastic crumpled. I immediately went on Amazon and ordered this one based on the reviews. I love it! It is just like my old one only much brighter, more magnification and I don&#x27;t have to hold down the on button anymore until both tubes catch. They both come right on. Don&#x27;t mourn your old Clairol this is the perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it.  It has the wrong voltage (110).  I need appliance with 220-240 volts.  Returning it would cost more than the money I paid for it.  Now I have to sell it.</li>
    <li> Nice little mirror till one of the bulbs blew, had it only about 3 months. This was a gift and I was disappointed for sure.</li>
    <li> The Jerdon Classic Tri-fold Mirror was purchased as a present for my wife, but I also have found it to be extremely useful. It is great for seeing how to insert my contact lenses. My wife loves it too.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be alittle bigger, but it wasn&#x27;t. Lightening not so good either. will be sending back soon</li>
    <li> This mirror works great !  The lights are nice and bright.  The side mirrors are slightly magnified..nice feature.  I would buy it again !  Much better than anything you can find in the stores.</li>
    <li> I like that this mirror has three panels. I also like that one side of the middle mirror is magnified. The lighting settings are basically just a color shield over the actual light. I personally wish it were just one light setting. The lighting is not a natural light so in my opinion I don&#x27;t get a realistic view of my face and makeup application. I would, however, recommend this product to maybe a teenager who is new to makeup.</li>
    <li> The lighting on this is horrible. The &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; setting is no where near a fluorescent color. It&#x27;s outright GREEN! You are better off buying some DAYLIGHT bulbs from home depot &amp; a magnification mirror and make your own little makeup station.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a christmas present last year.  She loves it.  Uses it everyday and its like very dark in our room.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product period- not much needs to be said about it . Great design and is exactly like it was advertised</li>
    <li> i love this mirror i bought this a year ago and its perfect for travel, i can use like a lamp whit the dimer set  everything its perfect on it ,thanks.</li>
    <li> My daughter previously had the type of mirror that was a round one on a stand so this one was different in a good way.  she gets three angles with this one</li>
    <li> Very good - not as bright as I would like, but better than I had, would recommend - but wish they would make even brighter.</li>
    <li> I hust love this I had to replae my old one whien it broke and I was torn between this one and one just like my old one so I upgraded to this one and I love it especially the trifold mirror part</li>
    <li> This was a very decent make-up mirror for appoximately one month.  Then the lights burned out.  The instructions indicate &amp;#34;Do Not Repair&amp;#34;; however, others have evidently had success in replacing the bulbs.  I have not encountered such good fortune.  The bulbs are about half the cost of the unit itself and are difficult to replace.  I refuse to go through the grief and aggrevation as I have no confidence on how long the bulbs will last once replaced based upon the 30-day life cycle I&#x27;ve experienced with this unit.  So, I plan to purchase a Conair and see if I can double my luck and have it last two months!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant buying this mirror because of mixed reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now though, and I like it.  The tri-fold is great for seeing both sides of my face.  I like that the center mirror tilts so I can get any angle.  The magnifying mirror on the backside is powerful.  I have not had any of the problems with the lights working that were reported by other buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t really love any of the 5 light settings.  They&#x27;re all a little strange; I still double-check my face in the mirror in my entryway.  But the mirror does what I need it to do, and I like it.</li>
    <li> Very functional and useful mirror...shows the smallest details</li>
    <li> I initially was going to move on to another model when a review that had a tip on the problem caught my eye. I read the comments which praised the review, saying how helpful that was. With renewed enthusiasm I clicked the Add to Cart button then bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry I did. To begin with I believe that the review that has the helpful tip was a different model. That review specifically says button. This current model doesn&#x27;t have a button but a switch. Holding this type of switch down for 5-10 seconds does absolutely nothing. It&#x27;s like [[ASIN:B000U5OXJ4 this typical household switch]], which would not respond to holding it down for any length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to say this, but it&#x27;s going back. I had high hopes for it but alas it is as defective as many others appear to be.</li>
    <li> I wish the day color wasn&#x27;t so pink!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local store and it worked fine...for about a month and a half...till the lights burned out.  Stupid me for thinking products I buy would actually function, so I no longer have the box or receipt for refund.  I read the review from the gentleman with the tip on how to get the lights back on by holding the button in for five to ten seconds, but that did not work.  Buyer beware on this piece of junk...save packaging and receipt!!!</li>
    <li> I had an old Carol magnifying mirror that finally went on me.  I read all the reviews for this one and was a little skeptical to order.  I received this mirror quickly and I love it.  I think the light is more than enough.  I personally use the \\&quot;Day\\&quot; setting only.  I have no problem recommending this mirror to anyone.</li>
    <li> No problems with this product not working or bulb issues...but I do wish the bulbs were brighter</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. Very bright fluorescent, not halogen, bulbs and the mirror tips up and down like I like it.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a makeup mirror that I was happy with for quite some time, and am very pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> This item, the Jerdon JGl9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror, was purchased in May 2010.  It is now July 1 2010.  By the middle of June, one of the bulbs started to dim.  Now it is almost completely out.  There are no instructions on how to change the bulbs. The side mirrors are hard to move.  The magnification mirror is poorly made - it makes me dizzy.  There is no phone number to contact customer service.  Over all, I am VERY disappointed in this product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MaryAnn Gibson (purchased for me by my husband,Andrew)</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for about 2 months now and have had no problems with the lighting yet.  It works as it should, although I find that I only use the light settings for day and night.  The magnified side of the mirror does look a little warped from far, but if you&#x27;re doing detail work you would probably be up closer to the mirror anyhow, so it isn&#x27;t a problem for me.  I do notice the plastic housing seems to get a little hot if I have the lights on for about an hour.  Aesthetically, it isn&#x27;t pleasing to the eye since it is just white and boxy, but functionally it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because reviewers loved it. Minus a few lightbulb defficiencies that did not worry me. I setup the mirror and when I moved the lever at the bottom to change the light settings it moved without difficulty or resitance - because it was broken! The lightbulb lighting does not change, it&#x27;s stuck at a pink color. I am returning this item and will not buy it again. The plastic feels cheap, but the mirror looks good. If you&#x27;re looking for a good mirror and do not care about the overall feel of the product or maybe getting a defective one, then this would be a good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for over a year.  It has a clear reflection with good lighting.  I really like the side mirrors.  I can easily see my reflection from the side to check my make-up.  The only downsides are that is not very attractive and the screws or springs or whatever it is in the right arm does not want to hold the position any longer.  Some reviews I read complained of the light switch not working.  I hold the light switch down for a few seconds, and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for a niece (hey, she specifically ASKED for one). Item absolutely DOA (won&#x27;t power up, no power to aux plug on front either). Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just past the 30-day-return mark for Amazon so I can&#x27;t return. No mfr warranty either, so I can&#x27;t return to them. Not happy with mfr or Amazon, at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the mirrors work, but without the lights it&#x27;s not all that useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT to add: asked the spouse to take a look at it - he opened the case, found two wires which were not connected to anything and an electronic part rattling around in the bottom. Fixed now, but definitely not a quality item.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely perfect how did I live before this ??? U won&#x27;t be let down jump on it!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate on it its creditworthy the money</li>
    <li> The magnified side is out of whack....just terrible. Not sending back due to hassle of repackaging and jumping through hoops. You should see the way I have to apply make-up. One eye open, and sideways for my face. When I go to my eye doctor he&#x27;s going to wonder why my eyes are so crossed. I will blame it on Jerdon and their crappy manufacturing practices. Goes to show, this country not what it used to be.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted one of these....my grandma had one and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I finally broke down and bought one for myself, and I was super excited for the magnifying mirror. I&#x27;m tired of being a contortionist to get close enough to the mirror to pluck my eyebrows. Anyway, I got it and it&#x27;s great - it&#x27;s nice and sturdy, it has a stand that can be adjusted for angle, the lights are great (I love having the four different light settings except the &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; one...YIKES is that how I&#x27;ve been looking under fluorescent lighting?? haha) And it&#x27;s the perfect size. The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like is when you flip it over to the magnifying mirror, it is kind of wavy/distorted. The mirror is kind of curved so I&#x27;m sure that it is a general design thing, unless I just got one with a bad mirror. This isn&#x27;t the worst thing in the world, I just kind of have to move my face to a different spot so it&#x27;s not all wavy when I&#x27;m trying to do close up work. If it wasn&#x27;t for that I would totally give 5 stars because this is really a nice mirror. So if the magnifying isn&#x27;t super important to you or you can deal with it possibly being a bit distorted (and really, magnifying mirrors kind of do that anyway), you should get it.</li>
    <li> Item works great.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s plastic, but I have yet to find another type of lighted makeup mirror that has a bigger mirror surface and better illumination.  I did have to sit it on top of a few books so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to slouch to see myself.  I don&#x27;t use the color bar, because it seems like a gimmick.  I&#x27;m glad other reviewers have explained how to change the bulbs in case it&#x27;s needed.  If you need a larger and brighter (and less portable) mirror, several DIY videos can be found on YouTube.</li>
    <li> So I love this mirror because I can plug my blow dryer in to it.  It is so convenient and I use it absolutely every single day. It arrived in perfect condition - Love it!!!  Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Loved this lighted mirror but didn&#x27;t measure the counter space I had available. I couldn&#x27;t use it but couldn&#x27;t bear to part with it because it was so nice. I gave it to my daughter who loves it and shares with her teen age daughter. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who wants a nice lighted make up mirror. Make sure you have the space for it before you order, my only suggestion. Otherwise it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Since it magnifies everything,  it makes it so much easier to put on eyeliner and makeup evenly.  A great purchase for those of you who LOVE makeup!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores and this is the exactly model I was looking for.  I don&#x27;t know why the brand name changed</li>
    <li> This is my second tri fold Jerdon mirror. The first one was about 10 years old, I l8ved it because of its multiple lighting views.  Can&#x27;t travel without it.</li>
    <li> This is a good mirror but the lights are not strong enough.  I don&#x27;t understand why they have the different colored lights for Day, Evening, Work, etc.  They don&#x27;t look any better.  I am using it but have to have a lamp on the table.</li>
    <li> The light worked only three days. No drops, no accidents. I am very disappointed and do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works good for my wife.</li>
    <li> focus seems to be 5X in the middle only and very up close</li>
    <li> Good lighting and magnification.  The support bracket on the back of mirror is flimsy.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday at school. The lighting it provides is fabulous.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! Totally resolved my issue with applying my makeup in my dark bathoom!</li>
    <li> The lighting is great and I can now put on my makeup so much easier</li>
    <li> We bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts. Both people were vey happy with the quality and usefulness of these units. Good product at an affordable price</li>
    <li> This is just like the ones that came out when I was in high school many years ago. It worked fabulous until I moved and broke it .......boo hoo!!  I will be purchasing another one in the near future!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I originally gave this one star, but that seems unfair- I had received an already-used-and-returned product. Not sure how that happened, but... we&#x27;re all human- someone obviously made a mistake. The mirror I received today works great- the switch has no kinks in it; you just turn it on, and it lights up. Maybe it&#x27;s a newer model? The 5xMagnification mirror is quite magnified; I move a certain distance from it to get my face into focus. I really like this mirror, actually. I couldn&#x27;t find anything like it in the several department stores I checked. Previously, I bought some other mirror instead (since that&#x27;s all they had at Target), and I hated it. This is more like the old one I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL POST: I was so excited. Until I plugged the thing in. Nothing. No lights. I&#x27;d seen the review, \\&quot;hold the on button down for 5 seconds\\&quot;. I held it down for a WHILE. Nothing. (I tried many different plugs, holding my mouth different each time- still nothing.)&lt;br /&gt;I went to pack it back up for return, which is when I noticed the Jerdon box it came in had been taped together at the corner. So the box had already been damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to put the packing slip return notice on the box, and noticed a small piece of Christmas wrapping paper still taped to the edge!&lt;br /&gt;OK, so... if someone returns something that didn&#x27;t work, it should go in the \\&quot;does-not-work\\&quot; pile, so that the next customer doesn&#x27;t get it by mistake. Yes?&lt;br /&gt;Maybe these things aren&#x27;t tested before being sent. Maybe this was just a fluke.&lt;br /&gt;PS Five minutes later, I&#x27;m upping my rating to 4 stars. Jerdon&#x27;s customer service got back to me quite quickly through email (not the phone number, which didn&#x27;t work). They sound very apologetic, and are maybe sending me a new mirror. If it works, I&#x27;ll bump the stars up to 5 stars and count my initial problem as an aberration.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic construction but the lighting variety was nice.  Unfortunately the 5x mirror is virtually useless, as it&#x27;s made of plastic and distorts the face, like a fun-house mirror!</li>
    <li> I received a Jerdon lighted mirror years ago and have especially enjoyed the magnifier mirror on it when tweezing my eyebrows.  After investigating other mirrors for my guest room, I decided to buy the same one because it is priced well and folds up for storage.</li>
    <li> It provides excellent degrees of lighting as well as many mirrors to get a full view and a different magnification mirror to see up close. The plug in the front I also very handy.</li>
    <li> I just love my new mirror!!&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find this mirror or one like it in any store..I went to about 4 stores..no luck, even Sears didn&#x27;t have the makeup mirror. They had a round LED lights that work with batteries, they were plastic, some were medtal, but, they wanted $34.00 for them.&lt;br /&gt;They weren&#x27;t made very well, nor did the lights become bright enough to see what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror has 4 light settings, plus the mirrors on the side help you see things you might have missed. It stands freely, Is just a joy to have a mirror I can see what I am doing.The mirrors flip over, so easy to use. Just plug it in, open the doors &amp; flip the mirror to your choice do your thing!&lt;br /&gt;I might buy another one..cause I have a feeling they will stop making them soon. Great buy.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the best makeup mirror ever. This is my second one to keep in RV for travels.  Have had the first one for years.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this at all!</li>
    <li> I only have one window in my bedroom, so I ordered this to get better lighting when getting ready for work or going out at night.  Very basic light settings.  But after using this to get ready, and venturing out into different light (day and/or night) it still helps.  And is better than the yellowish light in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lighted mirror to replace a Remington model I had for 25 years. Out of the box, the quality of the Jerdon mirror was inferior to the Remington mirror. The plastic frame on the Jerdon is very flimsy, letting the light shine through every where. Within six months, the right light began to fade and three days ago, both bulbs flickered and fizzled out. I had the mirror less than two years. The bulbs are very difficult to impossible to replace. I wish I had hung on to my old Remington. I absolutely cannot recommend the Jerdon mirror.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this mirror, exactly what I was looking for. It arrived in perfect condition a few days earlier than specified and works splendid! Thank you....</li>
    <li> I was afraid this would happen.. I read a review from a lady that the lights never worked when she plugged it in and turned it on.. I was hoping it was just a fluke. I opened mine and plugged it in and held the button down like the directions and just like one other person&#x27;s review... NOTHING. I am very disappointed ! I have always had good luck with everything I have ever gotten from Amazon.. Even so.. that my husband had already thrown the boxes away ! The instructions tell you that you cannot replace the bulbs. I tried calling the manufacturer ph number but no one answered.. going to try to call again tomorrow.. otherwise I am out the money on this !</li>
    <li> nice make up mirror &amp; I have had many</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  Bought this as a replacement to the 1st one I had that broke.  The electrical outlet is handy for blow dryers and straightening irons.  The magnification is just right.  Wish the light were a little brighter, but a great mirror overall.</li>
    <li> Great product. My teenage daughter uses it everyday. The ability to adjust the lighting is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Very nice no problem at all</li>
    <li> i purchased this as a gift for my teenage granddaughter and she loves it as well as her makeup looks sooooo much better now...</li>
    <li> Outstanding love it I will be getting one for all 3 of my sisters it really helps me with the black heads in my face.</li>
    <li> Jerdon makes a terrible piece of junk. I&#x27;ve had my mirror for less than two weeks &amp; now the lights don&#x27;t want to come on. They flicker &amp; go off. A sticker on the mirror indicates it might happen with first use due to differing electrical currents in the home &amp; you should just turn it off &amp; turn it back on. What a crock! It does not work to do that. &amp; differing electrical currents?! None of my other electrical appliances have issues. Do NOT buy this piece of junk!</li>
    <li> My 16 yr old daughter loves it.  She likes the variable light settings adn the 3 mirrors which can be adjusted so she can easliy see the sides and back of her hair.</li>
    <li> This is a really good makeup mirror.  I always use it on the brightest, whitest setting.  I had previously purchased a Conair mirror and it was ridiculously low light.  This lived up to all the hype of other reviews!</li>
    <li> Like others, I had a version of this mirror years ago and finally it died. This mirror is exactly as it is described and works as it is supposed to. I like the tri-fold for better, wider viewing, and the lights are bright enough to be very helpful. No problems at all with the product or the delivery of it. It&#x27;s not the most beautiful item in the bathroom, but it is functional with no hassles.</li>
    <li> Just what you need to get your makeup on!  I like the different settings it has and I like having 2 sides - 1 regular and 1 magnifying.</li>
    <li> This is a decent mirror. It is not very bright, I thought it would be really bright and it is not. I really think I would have preferred a mirror without the two side mirrors. I do not even use them and they kind of get in they way. I do like the magnified mirror, but you have to be an inch from it for you to be able to see yourself. I wish it would hae been brighter. You do have to hold the button down for the mirror to light, but I have had no problem lighting it up.</li>
    <li> I have had a Conair mirror for years, but ordered this mirror based on the reviews from other purchasers. I do not like that the lighting changes hue only, not brightness. The magnification mirror is almost useless to me as it seems to  blur things that I am looking at. I never had that issue with my old mirror. I threw out the box because it arrived on trash day or this would be going back for sure.</li>
    <li> This mirror was a replacement for a round style 10x magnification mirror that had a ballast which finally gave out.  I cannot get used to the magnification being so small, I miss the 10x magnification so much that I kept using the 10x even with no light.  Also the round 10x mirror was MUCH brighter.  This mirror seems to have Ok light at the center, but low light in the middle.  The worst part of this product is that it trips my hairdryer (which is plugged into a different outlet) almost every time I use it.  I live in a new house and have no other issues with anything tripping things in outlets and my old mirror never did that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mirror, closes easily, three mirrors, adjustable stand, but the lighting is inadequate. Wish there were stronger bulbs or the option to replace them with better ones.</li>
    <li> I really like this Jerdon Makeup Mirror.  It is instant on and the 5X magnification is great. Nary a blackhead goes undetected! It closes up nicely so it doesn&#x27;t get mucked up with hair spray as does everything within ten feet of my vanity! I would recommend it highly. Very good value!</li>
    <li> Item was precisely what I thought it&#x27;d be.  Received it in just a few days.  Was kind of leary on the delivery through US mail since it had several mirrors, but no problems at all.  Over all, everything ran like clock-work, couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lighted mirror I have ever owned. I don&#x27;t use it to apply makeup, as, I have, unfortunately for a woman, a very hairy chin. This mirror is very bright and since the bulbs are fluorescent they don&#x27;t get extremely hot or blind me after using it for a while. It also has a 5X magnification which allows me to see every little whisker, making it very easy for me to pluck them. I have owned similar items over the years, but this one deserves laurels!</li>
    <li> I have been using and seeking the hard to find used Remington and Clairol mirrors similar to this one for many years. This new Jerdon mirror is just as good as the old models (no longer made) and is almost 1/3 the price! Am very pleased with it and hope it lasts many years! Lights are flourescent so you might have to hold down the button for a sec but the FL tube lighting is far superior to normal bulbs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a similar lighted makeup mirror I owned for about 20 years, a side bulb burned out.  With this Jerdon product, I like the easy on and off button and the ease of selecting the proper lighting for the occasion.  However my old mirror had a heavy bottom and the mirror stayed in place on my dresser.  This new mirror has a really light bottom and doesn&#x27;t stay put.  I am forever sliding the entire mirror around so that the placement is correct for me to see myself.  It is not the mirror in the middle I am having trouble with, it stays however it is positioned.  The problem is with the entire mirror not staying put.  It is annoying but I am getting accustomed to it. Otherwise the product is good and very much like my old mirror.  I wear bifocals and can see perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my girlfriend. It was similar to one she had owned before.She loves this mirror! thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product.  I was a little concerned reading other reviews about difficulties in turning the light on, but mine comes on immediately.  The light is much better than the small bulb lights in my prior mirror.  Great product.</li>
    <li> bought this for my mom on mothers day. She is in love with it! She says it has the best lighting and all the mirrors are perfect.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a great price</li>
    <li> I had to return b/c the bulbs were too bright for my purposes.</li>
    <li> DAUGHTER LOVES THIS MIRROR AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not bright enough for me. The surface of the mirrors are small and it makes it difficult to use because of lack of bright light.&lt;br /&gt;Your face has to be right in the small surface to be able to see.  Gave it to my daughter.  She likes it.</li>
    <li> turned on three times then never again. its junk. PURE TRASH. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. this is not a product that you can easily take apart and like replace bulbs or something. ITS JUST JUNK. its a short or something. Bulbs work fine. ITS JUNK DONT BUY IT, DONT THINK YOURS WILL WORK FINE IT WONT DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> The light seems really off. the 5X magnification is not usable, since it distorts ons face to look like you are in a mirror fun house.</li>
    <li> The daylight setting on this mirror is great and even better than my old Remington mirror, HOWEVER, the magnifying mirror is terribly distorted and does have a &amp;#34;fun-house&amp;#34; mirror effect.  Bleh.</li>
    <li> Excellent lighting and mirror magnification quality.</li>
    <li> Finally I have a mirror that has great lighting and is big enough to see my full face. I love this mirror, one of the best.</li>
    <li> bought it for use on the magnified side, as I&#x27;m a little more advanced in age than 50.  very warpy, and doesn&#x27;t do anything to help me apply my makeup nor pluck brows.  if you&#x27;re not interested in the magnification, it&#x27;s fairly decent.</li>
    <li> Cheap gift. Girl used it once. Hates it. She leaves other gifts she barely uses out and about. She hid this one deep in the closet.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews and love this! Had it a few months and no complaints! Love the adjusting lights and outlet on the front!</li>
    <li> Great value for money. Very dated looking but gives decent light. For uk and ire u will need a us-uk power converter to use which can usually be bought for bout €8. Still works out cheap in my opinion.</li>
    <li> it worked for 1.5 months and then the cord stopped working</li>
    <li> just what i need, magnifying mirror great.</li>
    <li> My grandma got this for me, and it makes my makeup look flawless. Great buy</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mirror, however it has a few design flaws.  First, the collapsible stand is very flimsy.  I have had near misses of the mirror tipping over.  If you are going to keep it in the same place and hardly ever move it, then it should be fine.  But I wish the back of the mirror was sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, there isn&#x27;t any casing in the back.  In order to close the wings to keep the mirror dust free, you need to flip the mirror so that the normal side (as opposed to the magnifying side) is upwards.  But because there is no casing in the back, that leaves the magnified side exposed.  Again, this isn&#x27;t an issue if you keep this in the same place constantly.  But if you&#x27;re moving around or need to pack the mirror for travel, it isn&#x27;t the sturdiest protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, I feel it could be a bit bigger.  I don&#x27;t mind sacrificing compactness for better mirror coverage.  While the side wing mirrors get my face OK, I would like them to be bigger so I can also see my hair.  What is the point of having a mirror only for makeup?  Most women want to do their makeup and their hair in the same spot.  It&#x27;s not as if the current size is all that compact so they might as well make it bigger and sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides these flaws, I think this is a good product because the lighting is sufficient and the mirrors are good quality.</li>
    <li> Love the lights &amp; magnification mirror!  Works great &amp; can see my face again for makeup time.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I got to use this for 1 day.  The second day I turned it on and the lights would not turn on.  Returning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for 2 years as I write this. Fantastic buy for the price. I use it every day &amp; it&#x27;s still going strong. I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Happy to have bought this. I think it&#x27;s a good mirror for the price. It has different settings, different light settings, so depending on what time of day it is you can find the right light to apply your makeup. It&#x27;s also adjustable so you can make the mirror stand straight or lay back. I don&#x27;t have any other makeup mirrors to compare it with but it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> IT IS OK BUT I REALLY NEED A 4 IN POWER,  BUT IT IS AS GOOD AS ANY.</li>
    <li> This will be my 4th jerdon lighted mirror because it&#x27;s the best for putting on make up.  But if the lights go OUT, forget it, even my professional electrical shop said it cost more to replace the bulbs than buying a new one  and practically has to be broken into to get to the lights!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So beware!! DON&#x27;T LEAVE  THE LIGHTS ON TOO LONG.  Another throw away product.</li>
    <li> This design has been used by my wife over several other designs. So this replacement was vital. The old one failed to light and the bulbs are not customer replaceable; a pity. Shipment was swift and my wife is back on the air. This design can be a little tippy until you know how to move it. But that drawback is minor.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, it shows everything AAK but that&#x27;s a good thing. Lights work great too.</li>
    <li> so awesome I just love it</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Lighted makeup mirror. I had a Conair that I used for about 16 years and I was due for a new one. I have never purchased anything from the Jerdon brand and was not sure about it&#x27;s quality. It is great quality and the lighting works for every occasion that you need to apply makeup for. &amp;#34;Happy with my purchase&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> Great mirror but wife says don&#x27;t buy if you don&#x27;t want to see the defects on your face. (It shows everything) :-(.</li>
    <li> The magnified side is too much magnification for me; normal side not enough!</li>
    <li> This mirror is a help with my applying makeup - also the mirror has various settings which is a plus.  lisa</li>
    <li> Initially, one of the lights on the mirror flickered constantly.  I found by turning off and back on it would quit.  Now, the flickering has for the most part quit.  Other than that, it is just what I wanted and ordered.</li>
    <li> I like the mirrors and the lights but I hate being tied down by the cord, a short one at that. An optional battery powered source would be nice.</li>
    <li> The lighting is good, but you need to get very close to the magnifying mirror for it to be good. I like that there are different settings for the light.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for when I go away and there&#x27;s not alot of light in a hotel room to apply makeup. I needed something very close with alot of light.  I find that although this light is adequate I would have preferred even more light.  The different shades of light that are suppose to simulate day, night, etc. also to me aren&#x27;t accurate. Perhaps this light is adequate for someone else who doesnt require as much light, but for someone who requires a very well lit up area it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> This mirror was great while it lasted, which was only about 6 months, and then the lights burned out. I had a similar one prior to this that lasted 20 years! I would try another brand next time.</li>
    <li> I had one of these years and years ago and forgot what a wonderful tool this is for your makeup routine.  Love it. It makes you feel glamorous as you prepare for whatever your life brings to you today!</li>
    <li> I had a makeup mirror exactly like this one that lasted about 20 years until the bulbs on each side kept flickering off.  So if this one lasts half as long as the last one I&#x27;ll be happy.  I especially like the magnifying side of the mirror for plucking my eyebrows and the day to night light so you don&#x27;t overdo your makeup for day wear.  I can see even without my Acuvues in.  A dependable and functional mirror.  I had to order one as soon as the old one gave out since I now can&#x27;t live without one.</li>
    <li> The light bulbs lit for two seconds and then quit.  Other reviewers had said the bulbs were defective but then others had no problems so I went glass half-full.  Now I have to return the darn thing.  Next time I&#x27;m siding with the pessimists.  Nice item if it worked.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it reminded me of a mirror a lady from my childhood had. It is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about the lights, I have had zero problems.</li>
    <li> Am delighted to find this tri-fold lighted mirror! It replaces a long lost one I used for&lt;br /&gt;several years. The quality is as good as I remember, and I expect this one to serve me just as well. Good job, Jerdon!</li>
    <li> Great mirror I love that it has a socket up front that you can plug things you need into.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery, item description was exact, highly recommended,</li>
    <li> This mirror was over all terrible and I only wish I had the receipt to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The lights being only on the sides means you&#x27;re having to move your face from side to side to get the lighting you want.&lt;br /&gt;2) Light-weight, I have a glass top desk and it slides everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;3) Height, even though my chair is shorter than my desk I have to lean down to put makeup on. THE WHOLE TIME. I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;, not really used to being too tall for things.</li>
    <li> A convient way to apply make-up with all the bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is the spring the left side of the mirrow hinges isn&#x60;t working any more. I know you can not repair it. Nothing serious.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She has been very pleased with it, especially with the fact that it folds up for easy travel.</li>
    <li> it is not what I thought</li>
    <li> Goodness, I ordered this probably 3-5 yrs. ago &amp; it still works great.  I love that it has an outlet built into the mirror.  This is sooooo convenient when needing to use a hairdryer, curling iron, straighter, etx.</li>
    <li> This is not a good make-up mirror for those using the magnifying side. It is warped, and the visual looks like your in the house of mirrors! The price is to high for this item too. Returning it.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to getting this, but was dissapointed when I set it up. The slider that changed the lighting didn&#x27;t work. I had to ship back, got reembursed and had to settle for a different one .</li>
    <li> I like this mirror better than any I have purchased before.  I like the two sides of it, because the magnified mirror allows me to put makeup on with my contacts already in, and I can&#x27;t see up close on the regular mirror.  The lighting is ok, better than any mirror i&#x27;ve owned before, but I would still like it to be a little brighter.</li>
    <li> The light is not very bright - it&#x27;s kind of rickety - cheaply constructed I think.  Returning it!  Overpriced as well.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at Bed Bath Beyond for $38 which too me is a rip off; probably OK if it was more like $19. Just not a great&lt;br /&gt;mirror in my opinion for the money.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it,until the second week of using it and she heard a pop and smelled smoke. Now the lights won&#x27;t come on. I contacted the manufacturer via email and haven&#x27;t heard back from them yet. Its only been one day though, so I can&#x27;t really complain about their customer service...yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has different filter to turn around the bulbs for different kind of lighting. Was easy to set up. Directions were easy to understand. Just wish it had lasted longer.</li>
    <li> The magnifying mirror is distorted.  I had one just like it but this one is not clear....very distorted...not happy with the product..</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare this to other than the one my mother used growing up (Conair I believe), and that was in the 70&#x27;s-80&#x27;s ;) . I like it. It provides the extra lighting that I need in my make-up area. I keep it on the Daytime setting because it seems like the truest color. I was hoping for a fluorescent setting, which I assumed was their &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; setting, but the office setting is GREEN. I do not understand that at all. I really wish there were lights on the outside of the side mirrors, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s even available. It came in great shape, as expected, and the plug in on the front works well. I would recommend it above any other mirrors I have looked at.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that it would do the job but the lighting variations i.e., home, day, office, etc. don&#x27;t really show the right coloring of my skin.  I look pasty in some, yellowish in others.  I still use my small magnifying mirror and use the light from this contraption.</li>
    <li> Very very disappointed ! I was so excited to open the box! But when I switched it on it was grounded and burn! Smoke came out! Dangerous</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife and she loves it!</li>
    <li> More like a toy.&lt;br /&gt;Dim light. Clunky and useless</li>
    <li> &amp;#62;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;useful&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;And a good investment /gift for your girlfriend.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes the mirror says that magnification is perfect</li>
    <li> use it every single day. Love the lil plug outlet on it. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for Daughter and the 5X magnifying glass was distorted somewhat. It was not as clear as her older same model mirror.</li>
    <li> Perfect mirror for traveling,  fits great in luggage.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost a year and it is still working well.  My daughter uses it every day.</li>
    <li> This mirror, purchased from Amazon.com was exactly what I did not want.  It looked like what I wanted, but there is no view that isn&#x27;t colored and the magnified image (which I need) gives a distorted view that is very difficult on the eyes.  I bought it to replace another brand that lasted for many years before the bulbs burned out.  I would return the Jerdon, but no information was included for returns.  I would not buy it again.  I would just go with an unlighted, magnified one from the local discount store.</li>
    <li> bought it for my tween, who loves make up and is very worried about lighting. She had no idea makeup mirrors excited before getting this, so she loves it!</li>
    <li> I like this mirror so much that I purchased one for each of my two daughters and one for my daughter-in-law. You can see so well to pluck eyebrows, put on make-up, etc. We love it!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this item because it was so well rated. I rarely do reviews, however I felt it was necessary to say something about this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good bits: The tri-fold gives a good view of your face, and the magnification is great! It&#x27;s good to be able to tweak the light settings between green/purple/orange etc to check your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad bits: The first time I turned on the mirror, the lights were really bright, but within a second, there was a loud POP and the lights went out. I tried a different outlet, different plugs etc but only once did it respond with a faint flicker. This made me think the bulbs were not yet completely gone yet... But no matter how long I turned on the light, or what type of converter I used, the mirror wouldn&#x27;t light up again. I&#x27;m disappointed because there was no voltage warning on the instructions or the box that would have given me an indication that this would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just using this mirror as a normal mirror now... which completely defeats the purpose of getting a lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom.  She loves the lighing &amp; magnification option!  It also has a plug in for things like a curler!  I can definitely recommend &amp; would buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. The 3 panes adds value to the product  and the center flip mirror gives it more functionality.</li>
    <li> 5X magnification required mirror to be too close to my wife&#x27;s face to be of use to her. Lighting was not as bright as expected.</li>
    <li> I love the mirror. It has settings for all types of light, like evening, daytime, etc. Also the side mirrors are the best. You can see from all angles. Delivery was quick. I would recommend to everyone who needs a mirror that has all the features in one.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been enjoying this Mirror. The light On this mirror makes applying make up Easier. Overall a good Mirror</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the shipping because I got mine over night. Moving on. The mirror itself is great..when u first test it out ur like what the hell did I buy. BUT!!!, when u sit  and try it out you realize that the light projected is the right kinda light .. I just got it this morning... I know that the \\&quot;day\\&quot; light setting is going to be a favorite.. Now I know we all want the big bright light bulb light up a room kinda mirror but this product is perfect for home and do get the perfect makeup...very pleased</li>
    <li> My apartment does not have the greatest light setting. We have a projector that we watch tv on and play video games with so the lights are very dim wattage. Because of this set up my fianc&amp;eacute; decided to do, it&#x27;s hard to put my makeup on properly without making it look a little cakey. This mirror lights up beautifully! I am able to tweeze without missing a hair thanks to the magnification and my makeup has never looked more flawless in any light setting in a room. When you have the right tools, all you need is the right light to get the perfect look and this helped me achieve that! Would recommend to anyone looking for a good inexpensive mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
    <li> Just what I have been looking for! The lighting choices are perfect from day to office to evening to home so you can adjust your make up intensity for your occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day light is quite bright and the 5x magnification on the flip side of mirror is perfect for doing eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits nicely on my vanity table and folds up for travel or storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the plug on front to plug in a curling iron or flat iron. Great mirror! Highly recommend ,</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this mirror, which appears almost identical to my ancient Remington brand mirror that gave up the ghost after 20 years of daily use.  Unfortunately it is very different:  the lighting is signficantly dimmer, the daytime light setting is quite \\&quot;pink\\&quot; (akin to the \\&quot;evening\\&quot; setting on my old mirror), and the magnified side is concave shaped and distorting.  My old Remington, even without lighting, is vastly superior to this model, which I will be returning promptly.  This is another case of much lower quality standards where they don&#x27;t make them like they used to!</li>
    <li> just like the one I used to have so I am completely satisfied  with this replacement and also the cost.</li>
    <li> So my daughter and wife use to fight over one of those small make up mirrors, finally I got on here and looked among the mirrors and reviews and found this one. Well as everyone else says this mirror is great, my wife loves the light settings it comes with and that its three mirrors in one. Ontop of that it has a x5 magnification on it which is just another plus. The really nice part is it comes with a plug-in for the addition plugin it takes up so you can still plug your hair straightener or blow dryer into it. The only down size is the fact is says x10 magnification on the box and thats if you get just the right distances from it and then its just blurry but for this price its still the best out there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  The lighting is just right as well as the magnifying mirror.  It was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement for my wife&#x27;s original Clairol-20 years old.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror especially right after I washed my hair. The lighting has different shades so you don&#x27;t have to strain your eyes.</li>
    <li> The magnification mirror (the main reason I bought it) is so distorted you can barely make out your image. The rest of it works great. Would NOT recomend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine applying makeup any other way. I really enjoy this mirror and the light options it provides. There truly is a difference between &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; and I enjoy being able to toggle between the others. My only complaint is about the magnified side of the mirror. The mirror has a curve to it but the curve does not aide in magnification; in fact, it makes it more difficult to focus. I have better magnification (for eyebrow plucking, etc) in my $10 round Target mirror than I do from this one.</li>
    <li> This is the third Jerdon lighted makeup mirror I have purchased (since burned out light bulbs cannot be replaced) and I&#x27;m significantly unhappy with this one. The magnified side of the mirror is so distorted that it&#x27;s almost impossible to apply my eyeliner and I get a headache if I look into it for more than a minute or two. Threw away the packaging and won&#x27;t be returning it, but unlikely to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 14 year old daughter - she loves it!  She was sitting on the floor before, now on her desk.  She can plug in her flat iron in the front and loves the magnification to pluck her eye brows.  Honestly - this looks old school to me and I was looking for a more modern mirror - they were all very expensive, like $250, and very much smaller.  Glad we tried this!</li>
    <li> My son in law bought it for my daughter who&#x27;s a makeup freak!!!  She loved it!!!</li>
    <li> I order this lighted mirror June 7, and had been satisfied until now, July 2. This morning, the lights suddenly blinked out. I flipped the switch to off, then on again to find they lit up again.  But after only a minute or two, out they went again. I repeated this another 2 or 3 times, waiting a bit between attempts, and each time, they would light, then fail.  I should have been able to see this coming, I guess, given where it was made.  Fortunately, I still have the box in which it came, and I will be seeking a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I cannot endorse this product.</li>
    <li> 80&#x27;s are back and this was one thing I needed to replace - I love this thing and the 5x mirror is helpful too!</li>
    <li> I have two of these now.  After about 6 months of use, the lights stopped working.  I finally got through to Jerdon and they told me that normally I would have to send it back, but that they would make an exception and send me a new one.  They told me to cut the cord on the old one.  So they sent me a new one.  It worked fine for a month and then it did the same thing with the lights.  I called them again but the woman I got this time was rude and told me that I would have to send it back before they would send me another.  Which I understand, but you know what....  I don&#x27;t want another...  Why would I want another problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I still had my Clairol True to Lite mirror..  It worked great for over 30 years until my cat knocked it off the counter! Even then the lights still worked!</li>
    <li> MY EYESIGHT IS NOT GOOD. THIS MIRROR IS JUST PERFECT. I AM SO GLAD I FINALLY BOUGHT ONE.</li>
    <li> Best lighting ever....love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a tri-fold mirror for a long time. I am very pleased with the mirror&#x27;s many functions + it&#x27;s easy to fold down &amp; put away.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d like using a mirror like this, but it&#x27;s really been so helpful. As a mom it&#x27;s hard to find much time to myself in the morning, and taking time to do makeup just wasn&#x27;t happening. Now I&#x27;ve started using this at the table where I can still keep an eye on my girls, or sometimes even do makeup during breakfast. Very nice to have the ability to take my time doing my makeup for the first time in a couple years with the convenience to do so in whichever room my girls are in rather than stuck in the bathroom trying to rush while wondering what they&#x27;re up to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this has come in handy while traveling. Granted it wouldn&#x27;t be practical to bring if flying, but during a 2 week road trip I used this quite a bit. Stayed in several hotels along the way which only had one mirror located inside the bathroom. With this I could easily do my hair and makeup while the bathroom was occupied allowing us to get back on the road earlier in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the mirror itself I honestly don&#x27;t have much to compare it to as I&#x27;ve never used another similar mirror. As I said though, it&#x27;s been great for my needs, despite my doubts about whether I&#x27;d like using this type of mirror. I&#x27;ve actually found it&#x27;s nice to be closer to the mirror, especially when doing eye makeup. Very happy to have purchased this.</li>
    <li> Very good mirror. I wish the light was brighter. But it seem to be the brightest mirror out there. The Magnification mirror is great, can&#x27;t wear my glasses to put make up on &amp; with the magnification mirror I can see well enough to put make up on. The mirror arrived quickly &amp; in good condition.</li>
    <li> The magnifying mirror is blurry and I can&#x27;t see to put make up on !  I&#x27;ve purchased one of these mirrors before and it worked perfect that&#x27;s why I purchased another but this one is terrible !</li>
    <li> 1. The switch doesn&#x27;t work well, meaning it cannot move to &#x27;day&#x27; or &#x27;home&#x27;, only dwell in the middle area.&lt;br /&gt;2. The light source is cheap and low intensity. Basically it&#x27;s just low quality fluorescent light bulb covered with different color of glass paper.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s plastic. I&#x27;m afraid I will break it, especially the stand foot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lighted make-up mirror at the end of May 2010.  Both lights blew out at the same time at the end of Dec. 2010.  The product was great while it worked, but not worth the money to have only lasted 6 months.  The maker of this product won&#x27;t allow the buyer to change light bulbs, so the item had to be thrown away.  Why would I pay an electrician to install light $7.00 light bulbs.  I would not recommend this product because there is a definite flaw in this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because I wanted to be able to take care of my horribly asymmetric eyebrows myself but needed high magnification and good lighting to do so. This completely and totally fits the bill. The lights are plenty bright, though I may disagree with the very pink nature of the evening light setting - haha. I love the plug in the front of the mirror - it allows me to use my blow dryer, straightener, etc. even though the mirror itself takes up one of my outlets. I also really appreciate the warranty that comes with it. The lights are guaranteed to function for life, but if they don&#x27;t for whatever reason you just ship it back to the manufacturer and they replace the lights for free. All in all, this was a great buy for an even better price.</li>
    <li> This unit works very well and I have had no trouble with the lighting.  I wanted to use it to layer cut my beard and need good lighting and side view.  I still have not figured out how best to make it work but I will!  NIce compact unit.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality mirror.  It has the features one would expect, for a price perhaps lower than what you would expect to pay.  The mirror rotates from standard to 5x magnification, and it has side mirrors which can be angled for profiling.  It has four distinct lighting options, \\&quot;Day, Office, Evening, and Home\\&quot;.  It also includes a handy receptacle in the front for accessories such as hair rollers, blow dryers, flat irons, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality seems to be good.  Overall this is a nice product, and if you are in need of a cosmetic mirror, it is recommended without reservation.</li>
    <li> Changing my review because, I purchased this for my teenage daughter in Dec. She really liked it.  Well I posted a 5 star review first and then one of the light bulbs started turning black and the lights won&#x27;t come on. I don&#x27;t know what to do now because the mirror didn&#x27;t come with a warranty. We&#x27;ve only had it for 3 months. I would not recommend this mirror.  There is no way to change the light bulbs. I am attempting to tear it apart. We are bummed :(</li>
    <li> I should have heeded other reviews regarding the failure of the mirror to light-up. When I first turned it on it didn&#x27;t light up; I left it in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position. After about 45 minutes, it lit up. After that for about two days, it worked, lighting immediately upon turning on the switch. Day 3 - would not light up no matter how long I left it on. Has not lit up since. Very disappointed because returning items purchased on-line is such a hassle.</li>
    <li> Decided to buy this when my old one I had for 20 years finally died. Price seemed fair and same design as my old Clairol one. Received it plugged it in and worked fine for about two weeks and used only for maybe 10 minutes each time turned on. Of course I was shocked when it just went out. No not the bulbs the actual unit that connects to the bulbs.  Took it to an electrician friend and he couldn&#x27;t get over  it going out that quickly.  I had thrown the box out or I would have returned it!  Don &#x27;t buy this!!!  Costco has one for around $20.00 go get that one!</li>
    <li> I have had a Clairol makeup mirror since the late 80&#x27;s. I never had a problem with it and never had to replace the bulbs. It quit on me in December so I purchased this makeup mirror three days ago at Bed, Bath and Beyond and it is already not working. When I turned it on this morning, the lights came on for a second (more dimmed than before) and then went off. I tried several times to get it back on and had no luck. I tried a different outlet and it never came back on. For almost $40, I would expect this mirror to last longer than three days! I am taking this one back and getting another Clairol one on ebay. Things are just not made as well as they used to be!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter who said that she loves this mirror it allows her to see perfectly in all three sides and has many setting on lightening.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST MIRROR. I TRIED SEVERAL OTHERS LITES WERE NOT AS BRIGHT ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU CANNOT CHANGE LIGHT BULBS IF THEY BURN OUT.</li>
    <li> This mirror is really great. It has 4 different settings resembling outdoor, fluorescent, etc. My vanity was is in a place where there isn&#x27;t much light, and it&#x27;s so much easier now to figure out how much blush or eye-shadow to put on. I would really recommend this mirror!!</li>
    <li> very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Helps see everything on your face to put your makeup on with out any blurrs or skips.  I recommend this product for people with poor vision.</li>
    <li> Great while it worked.  I bought this on December 17, 2010, and it stopped working on December 5, 2011.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, so not even a year&#x27;s use out of it.  I don&#x27;t like buying things that don&#x27;t last, or can&#x27;t be repaired.  One reviewer mentioned that the cost makes it disposable.  I think that is just sad.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am an avid reader of reviews before I buy products from any website especially Amazon.  They are usually informative and helpful.  That being said after reading reviews for this product I decided to purchase it.  This was a christmas gift for my girlfriend so I expected it to work.  It didn&#x27;t.  The lights wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  I was quite surprised so I went back and started reading reviews again.  I noticed by default Amazon pulls up \\&quot;the most helpful\\&quot; reviews...not the newest.  When sorting by the \\&quot;newest\\&quot; reviews first I found out I&#x27;m not the only one that received a faulty unit.  Apparently the quality has really went down hill so my suggestion to you is when purchasing any product from Amazon make sure to read the newest reviews first.  A great review from 5 years ago doesnt necessarily translate into a good product today. Shame on you Amazon.</li>
    <li> The mirror is exactly what my mom wanted. The different light settings are great. The only problem was that the light has shorted out a few times but with a little jiggle it turns back on. Shes had it Since December 2010 and is still using it everyday, 2yrs later!</li>
    <li> I like the mirror except that the slides are not the same. When I have &#x27;Day&#x27; selected it is half green and half pink on one side and half purple and pink on the the other. I wish I could contact the seller, I would like to exchange my mirror, I really do like it. I may return it; I&#x27;ve only had it since the day before Chrismas.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas.  She was so excited.  It worked for exactly 1 day then would not come on.  Returned.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for a few months now and I&#x27;m just not really happy with it. The light is absolutely not bright enough. I had to take a desk lamp and set it up behind the mirror shining directly at me from above the mirror. Now, I don&#x27;t have any room on my vanity for makeup.</li>
    <li> Was a great gift. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I was initially very pleased with this mirror BUT after only owning the mirror for 7 months, the lights stopped working! The lights can not be replaced by the customer. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a product that doesn&#x27;t fill my need. Not happy at all because now I have to buy a new mirror!!!</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t too many of these &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; makeup mirrors left, I find.  This one is good, but the so-called &amp;#34;5x&amp;#34; magnification is distorted.  It makes my face look elongated and my chin real long.  Weird!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Clairol for like 25 years, before I broke down and bought this one.  Theirs had a magnified mirror that was perfect for me.  This does not.  I would return it, but I&#x27;m afraid there wouldn&#x27;t be a better one from Jerdon for me.</li>
    <li> It was a little smaller than I expected, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the measurements. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great, and the extra outlet was an added bonus.</li>
    <li> This is a classic make-up mirror which has been around for decades! I bought this for my almost 13-year old daughter 2 months ago and she loves it. She loves the different light settings (although I always found that the daylight setting is the only practical one, still she thinks its fun to have options) and also the ability to plug in her curling iron directly into the mirror. This mirror is an oldie, but still a goodie and the price point is great for all.</li>
    <li> I had this mirror or  a very similar one and it lasted about 20 years! My husband bought this one for me when the old one finally gave out. It is not as solid as the old one and after a year, it broke. The lights would only go on intermittently.The stand where you can adjust the angle of the mirror also broke fairly soon too. I was disappointed as its features are exactly what I like in a cosmetic mirror.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Had this same mirror for 5 years before the lights stopped working liked it so well I purchased it again.</li>
    <li> Unable to use due to wattage difference. Too expensive to buy a transformer!</li>
    <li> Daughter said &amp;#34;OMG, I can see everything!!!&amp;#34; when she was putting on her makeup. It is a very good product and helps aid in the application of makeup. No flaw should be missed with this mirror!</li>
    <li> Too big. Not enough light &amp; not enough magnification</li>
    <li> I love it...the electrical outlet on the front was much needed and amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror..A little magnified twist but it does the trick for the price ..Had mine for over a year now and use it daily.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd one  my wife has had,,one problem the mirrors don&#x27;t stay at different angles  after it&#x27;s been used for a few months</li>
    <li> I like that it is a three way mirror.  The daylight setting seems off to me...not like daylight.  The magnified mirror is distorted and it bothers my eyes a bit to look into it.  So ...I wish that the daylight had a better light and that the magnification mirror was not distorted.  Also It&#x27;d be great if the main mirror in the center could swivel sideways and around rather than up and down.  With a sideways swivel you can angle the mirror in all kinds of ways to see different parts of the face.</li>
    <li> Very good mirror with built in lights that simulate variety of environments, so you can check out your make up in different ambiances.&lt;br /&gt;Cost effective for sure ;)</li>
    <li> THIS MIRROR IS THE WAY TO GO FOR CONTACT WEARERS AND FOR HAIR AND MAKE-UP.  I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS BUT THE PLASTIC SUPPORT IN THE BACK NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.</li>
    <li> The worst lighting ever. It turns your face from green to red. Yuck! Do not send as a gift to Anyone.</li>
    <li> Still unable to use this product as the power cord does not fit an Australian power outlet. Great looking item though.</li>
    <li> Been using this since last Christmas and it&#x27;s the best!! I highly recommend it and I even dropped it once and it didn&#x27;t break. Good quality</li>
    <li> I really love this Mirror.  Its so easy to fold up and unfold.  Doesnt take up much space.</li>
    <li> Magnifying side has very poor image - like a fun house mirror. Worthless.</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror less than one month.  It blew up this morning, all bulbs gone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s large enough to do my hair and makeup comfortably, small enough to fit on a shelf. Closed, it&#x27;s about the size of a family-size Cheerios box give or take an inch or so. Opened, it takes up the same amount of space as a large, opened textbook or dictionary leaning on a desktop bookstand. The lights are very bright, although I mainly stick with the Day setting since it&#x27;s the brightest. The side mirrors are great and large! The magnification is perfect and allows me to tweeze my eyebrows comfortably. The plug is so convenient! It allows me to plug in my flat iron, hair dryer, and other tools when there are no other available outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great purchase! I recommend this for people who may not have adequate space for a full-on vanity but enough space to sit this on a desk or counter from time to time.</li>
    <li> Light work the first few times.  Now it don&#x27;t got used</li>
    <li> Magnification side is distorted but the other side is ok. The lights seem to be fine, just cannot use because the glass seems wavy which causes it to look distorted when trying to put makeup on. Bummer~~~</li>
    <li> Bought this to get our 14 year old daughter out of the bathroom every morning when putting her makeup on.  It has been a Godsend for her, done wonders for the availability of our guest bathroom and restored some of our sanity.  Works as advertised and has proven to be one of the more durable items we have purchased for her.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves sitting I front of this putting her makeup on.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter loves this mirror.  I remember having something similar when I was her age.  She enjoys changing up the lighting effects while she gets ready.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughters for Christmas and they love them. Good quality.</li>
    <li> The mirror is warped. Bad buy</li>
    <li> I like that the side doors stay put - I had another one that didn&#x27;t and it was pointless to have them at all.  I also love have an outlet in the mirror, so convenient. No blinking lights or flickering in mine. Worked fine from the start.  Usually that has to do with the ballasts and the person installing them not being &#x27;grounded&#x27; at the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror as a gift for my Mother, and she loves it.  She had an old model, similar to this that was about 15 years old and it finally broke.  The extra outlet on the front is a definite necessity, with having flat irons, etc...  and the 2 side mirrors are an extra plus on this mirror, so you can really get a good angle visual,  unlike with most make-up mirrors.  I think anyone who uses make-up or does treatments on their face, or hair, can get plenty of use out of one of these!</li>
    <li> I returned this item. It&#x27;s just too big for my vanity. I give it 5 stars anyway, because it does work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Just like in junior high! This mirror is great! I might get one for my niece for xmas!</li>
    <li> This mirror started flickering off and on just a few months after I bought it. It is only about 6 months old. The lights have gone off and on and now the lights have gone out for good!</li>
    <li> granddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> earned top kudos with DW</li>
    <li> My wife loved it! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Dissapointed. The mirror is much smaller and the light much dimmer that my 20 year old Clairol. I should have bought another one of those. Also, it&#x27;s so light weight that it feels cheap and easily falls over. Oh well........</li>
    <li> My old mirror finally died after over 15 years of use.  (It didn&#x27;t survive the move to the new house.)  I was thrilled to find that it was still being made, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  It was torture for the week that I had to live without it.  It provides the perfect lighting for applying make-up or tweezing my eye brows.  I just hope that this one lasts as long as the previous one!!!</li>
    <li> I think if the mirror was a little bigger and the lights a little farther on the sides this would be much better... You have to have your face right up as close as you can get it to see anything right....It&#x27;s just ok....Nothing special....</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this mirror, I read many other reviews and decided to check it for myself, as my old Remington mirror (which is no longer made)died out and I was desperate for something new.  Well....here&#x27;s the honest truth of the good and the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good...the regular mirror is perfect and it&#x27;s nice to have some side view mirrors as well.  Bad... the flip side of the mirror that gives you a 5x magnifier makes you feel like you are at an amusement park looking at yourself in a mirror with a distorted view.  Although I would sometimes use that on my old model, I could live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good...the \\&quot;day\\&quot; light choice was the same as my old model and provides me with just the right light.  Bad... there is a lever to slide which moves colored plastic over the lights to give you other types of low lighting, but it&#x27;s stuck and won&#x27;t move past the day light.  I could have returned it but didn&#x27;t want to wait for a new one since I never used other shades of lighting on my make up mirror and only used the day light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that others were frustrated when you turn the lights on that they shut off. That&#x27;s because of the kind of bulbs they are.  You have to hold down the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch long enuf for them to light up. So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good is that they do work.  The bad is, (which is not so bad)is the slight humming noise, again because I believe they are a florescent (sp) light.  I fixed that by putting a soft pad underneath the mirror it to absorb the sound.  I don&#x27;t really even hear it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d rate it less than 4 stars... but all in all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The left side won&#x27;t close all the way. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I found this makeup mirror to be exactly what I needed.  I use it on Day Setting the most.  I would think it assist in my application of makeup pretty good as I my girlfriends always remark that my makeup always looks good &amp; no streaks or lines.  Great to pluck eyebrows &amp; see those little flaws you want to cover.</li>
    <li> Great bright lights and larger mirror size.</li>
    <li> Greate for makeup its help me alot i love it</li>
    <li> not as bright as i had expected, however, excellent for young eyes. i gave it to my granddaughter and she LOVES it</li>
    <li> Cheaply made.  The sliders on the sides to change the settings (daytime, office, etc.) was basically broken.  I couldn&#x27;t get them to slide properly.  Returned it immediately.  I&#x27;m still looking for a lighted make up mirror!  Darn!</li>
    <li> Very nice, now so sure I like the lighting adjustments much, one looks pinkish and one looks kind of blue, the regular one is fine with me.</li>
    <li> I mainly purchased this mirror to use at the hotel for my son&#x27;s wedding, knowing that hotel lighting is so poor.  I set it up on the small table in the room, which freed up the bathroom for my husband.  It was a win/win!  At the time of purchase, I had in mind to use it at home as well, as I have to lean so far forward over my bathroom sink to see well enough to apply eye makeup (I wear glasses so have poor eyesight without them).  I&#x27;m sure that years of that have contributed to back pain issues.  Anyway, I use the mirror at home every day and I really appreciate being able to sit down and have the mirror close to my face....minimal leaning forward.  It&#x27;s great and I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
    <li> My only problem with this mirror is that it is a little bit too big. But I love the light changes and the magnification works great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I use this for daily make up! it has different setting for days or nights. good product</li>
    <li> Best makeup mirror out there under $50</li>
    <li> it was okay....... the 5x&#x27;s is really not enough</li>
    <li> I have tried to write a thorough review explaining the problem I have with this mirror, but it keeps getting rejected.  I have checked it over and over and can&#x27;t see why... anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification mirror provides such a distorted image (due to the necessary concave glass), you have to be about 3 inches away to see anything clearly.  Even then the field of view that is useful is very small.  If you need this side of the unit, it may not be what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single magnification side of the unit seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> After about a week the lights began to flicker and had a burnt smell. I unplugged it and put it away. There was a note that this could occur. I followed the directions but it still did not work.</li>
    <li> Tried them all, this one is the best.  Once the stand broke off and I taped it for a year.  The bulb went out on one but I still have never found one I liked better.  lighting not to dim! Hey you use it every day!</li>
    <li> When I was looking for a makeup mirror and came across the Jerdon Tri-fold, I was so excited as I had a very similar model that I loved many years ago.  Although I never used the different light levels, preferring just the brightest lights, I really liked the fact that it also had an additional outlet for a curling iron or rollers along with the large tri-fold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, that&#x27;s where the excitement ended. I used the mirror the next morning, did not have nearly enough light even with additional lamp light to complete my makeup.  I finally went back to the bathroom mirror to finish my makeup.  I tried again the next morning checking my makeup in the bathroom mirror when I was done and I actually looked like a clown.  The light was totally off, and gave a very different picture from the makeup mirror to the bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use this mirror, and I cannot return it without the packaging.  I&#x27;ll donate it and try out the next makeup mirror BEFORE I buy it.  Sadly, this one is not for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy now while available. $29 Prime is a Great Price! Mine was more expensive $50, but no regrets! You get the bang for your buck. Perfect for everyday use, great lighting. Wish they would create one in black that&#x27;s battery operates. I would then purchase 2!</li>
    <li> The 5X magnification is extremely distorted!!! Cant use it its so bad.</li>
    <li> Bought this lighted mirror a year and one half ago. Doesn&#x27;t work at all now.&lt;br /&gt;Spend a little more money and get something better.</li>
    <li> I found this mirror to be good for now. Center mirror seems a bit blury while the side mirrors were fine. The lighting is not adequate enough. I will keep looking for something better. The shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I would recommend that you heed the other reviews that complain about the lack of good lighting with this mirror. I had a Remington and I broke the mirror. The Remington is no longer available, so purchased this as a replacement. I liked the idea of the fluorescent bulbs, and was used to holding the button for a bit for them to warm up as I had to do that with the Remington. The light is so poor -for me anyway and compared to what I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love my mirror...  great vanity mirror, works great and love the  5x mangnifying mirror..will most definitely recommend...&lt;br /&gt;My sister came over and loved it as well..</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it was the wrong voltage for this Country but they very kindly said they would refund the money to me, as the postage to return it was £34.60, more than the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light was good but a pity it didn&#x27;t work in the UK.  A shame when you can buy a camera and an I-Pad in the States and only need a plug adapter!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It&#x27;s the second or third I have had but couldn&#x27;t change the bulbs in the other ones.  The instructions to the new one say that the bulbs CAN be changed.  Sure hope that true!</li>
    <li> I am liking my new lighted mirror.  I didn&#x27;t want a crazy high magnification, so 5X is perfect for me.  This one has an adjustable light going from day to office to evening to home.  I think this mirror will fit the bill for me &amp; I&#x27;ll enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Had this for years. Great mirror. I use this everyday since I bought it. Great to use when plucking facial hair too. Lighting feature is great. Lights have never burned out either.</li>
    <li> This mirror is only decent if you never plan on using the magnifying side of the mirror. It&#x27;s VERY distorted and looks like a fun house mirror. It&#x27;s a reasonable expectation that a two-sided mirror should actually work well on both sides. It is being immediately returned and I will find one from a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Great makeup mirror. The light can be a little painful on the eyes though.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and the lights are so bright and it shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I really hate this mirror. I thought I would love it because it has 2 side mirrors, but NO. The different settings of light sources aren&#x27;t really helpful and I had to add an additional table lamp for more light as the 2 this comes with isn&#x27;t enough.  The magnifying mirror doesn&#x27;t work like you would think. It&#x27;s more like a circus mirror and it really hurts my eyes when I try to use it as it doesn&#x27;t make your face appear in focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get this.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror.  It&#x27;s bright enough, and since it uses fluorescent rather than incandescent bulbs, it stays cool.  The little outlet on the front is convenient, and I like that the center mirror can swivel up or down independently from the side mirrors.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a mirror with good lighting for years. I LOVE THIS MIRROR. It will not dissappoint you. The 5x magnification mirror is great for aging eyes. The lighting is exceptional. It also states the bulbs should never blow out, we will see about that. Certainly, this mirror is worth it&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> I anxiously awaited the arrival of this mirror.  You can not find this style anymore in stores.  I bought it to replace a 20+ year old Vidal Sassoon mirror (same style). The lights kept burning out and they are hard to find so I thought it might be less expensive just to replace the whole mirror.  I am glad I did. It meets all my expectations.  The 4 different light settings are great.  There is a slight distortion on the edges of the magnification side, but not enough for me to return the item.  I just might order another.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent Christmas Gift for the wife. The 5x magnification&lt;br /&gt;was a big extra and the lighting is excellent for makeup applications.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Several light settings and very compact. Is even suitable for travel. Very nice mirror for the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light up make up mirror but wanted a really bright one&lt;br /&gt;which wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;junky\\&quot;.  I am VERY PLEASED with the mirror!  It&#x27;s extremely bright and the 5X allows me to apply makeup without my glasses&lt;br /&gt;which is very convenient.  Heavy, metal housing, doesn&#x27;t tip, I close&lt;br /&gt;after use but leave in position.  An wonderful mirror for $30!  Would&lt;br /&gt;reconmend highly!</li>
    <li> The mirror is not good quality, distorted view.  I am returning</li>
    <li> Ordered this mirror and for the first day or so did not think I would keep it.  The magnification is 5X and does give one a good view of one&#x27;s face (wrinkles and all) but find that fact that one has to sit so close to get a clear view disconcerting.  Also don&#x27;t care for the different light settings as none seem to be very realistic.  All and all it is a good mirror and appears well made (I followed intructions with regard to holding the light switch down for full illumination) and have had no problems thus far. Preferred my older Hartman makeup mirror with the built in clock (handy for the am rush) but think this is an acceptable substitute and in some ways better (can see close up well which helps a lot with tweezing, etc. Would probably purchase again</li>
    <li> This item is exactly the same as a makeup mirror my wife purchased twelve years ago (different brand name, though).  After 12 years, the light switch began to fail.  She was ecstatic to see that I&#x27;d found the same mirror for her!!  It&#x27;s a great bargain!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this mirror for me for Christmas.  Two months later and I&#x27;m still struggling every morning trying to get the darn thing to light up.  This morning, I wasted 20 minutes trying ... without any luck.  I finally dismantled it and dragged out my old unlighted mirror.  This one is going to a garage sale \\&quot;with a warning.\\&quot;  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> My eyes have gotten so bad, I couldn&#x27;t see to put on my make-up on well at all. I didnt want these new mirrors that are out. I&#x27;m from the old school. and use to have one of these kind of mirrors and I knew they worked. Use one in my High school days the 80&#x27;s when we wore lots of make-up. No I dont use that much now! lol! I was so happy when I found this one and that they still made them!! It works so great., even my mom, who lives with us uses it. I&#x27;m gonna get her one for her birthday!</li>
    <li> big mirror.. sad i dont have place where i can put it.. so it is in the box. in my room.. sometimes i use .. if u have huge bathroom or table where u can poot it..so its for you.good quality.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Jerdon lighted make-up mirror and am very pleased with it. The bulbs do not give off heat- which I love. Also, the 5X magnification is great for tweezing your brows (you can see EVERY little hair) and applying your eye make-up. I switch to that side after the rest of my make-up is put on. I would recommend this mirror; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Love it! I was so worried that it would not have a bright enough light. I hate that! But it was great! Light is definitely bright enough for my makeup needs. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great addition to guest bedroom dresser.  Very helpful when guest prefers to have a place in the bedroom to put on makeup!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she really likes it. She is an aspiring makeup artist so she uses it quite a bit. She said the only downside is that the light adjustment dial is pretty hard to slide back and fourth. Other than that it&#x27;s a cool mirror, it even has a power outlet on the mirror for hair straighteners or whatever you feel like plugging into it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this mirror.  It is a good value.  The tri-fold mirror allows for excellent view.  The options for lighting make the mirror versatile.  I bought it as a surprise gift and the recipient was delighted.</li>
    <li> I owned a Jerdon mirror for several years.  When it died in Oct. 2012, I ordered another.  The lights on the new mirror lasted less than 3 months.  You cannot change the light bulbs.  I will return the mirror and hopefully receive a refund.</li>
    <li> I use the mirror on trips because places that I travel never have proper lightening or great mirrors. It is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased this light-up mirror for my daughter as a gift.  It is similar to one I had growing up.  She loves it!  It was definitely a great gift for a teenage girl. : )</li>
    <li> Great travel mirror; good light &amp; mirrors.  Best one I&#x27;ve had!</li>
    <li> I  use a makeup mirror everyday, and this one was to replace one that got dropped and broken. The flip magnification mirror is similar to a fun house mirror. The distortion is awful. I get a headache  if I try to use it too long. So I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost to send it back prohibits my having done that, so this is my way of retaliation for send out a inferior product.</li>
    <li> I have this, but I am not impressed with the lights.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem to light up my face very well.  I&#x27;ve applied make-up only go get somewhere with better lighting and find numerous flaws!  The idea is sound, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to light well unless you are right up next to it.</li>
    <li> is like using a candle in front of the mirror</li>
    <li> I use this mirror for about two month now and very happy with the purchase. The light is strong enough for me to put make up while in total darkness without using any extra light in the room. 4 color light selections is a good option but I don&#x27;t use it much. Overall, a good mirror for the price.</li>
    <li> Purchased, received, unpacked, turned on. That&#x27;s where things started to go downhill.  I slid the little light changing tab across and it snapped off, flew out of my hand and onto the floor where one of my cats thought it was the best little toy I had ever bought her.  After wrestling the small piece of plastic away from the cat, I reattached it to the little metal piece that \\&quot;held it\\&quot; (obviously, I use that term loosely).  The lights were stuck on part pink (daytime??) and part green (martian time?) and wouldn&#x27;t budge.  Packed it back up and shipped it back.  Good times.</li>
    <li> ...this mirror was fine...until the bulbs burned out. There isn&#x27;t (that I could find) a way to change the bulbs. They did last quite a while, but what good is it to have to spend $30 a year on a new mirror as opposed to maybe $5-$10 for new bulbs??? I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> This is just the mirror I have been looking for. Size, price &amp; ability to store GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely suggest as a great gift</li>
    <li> I read many reviews prior to purchasing this \\&quot;lighted\\&quot; mirror but I was hopeful and on a budget. First off, it&#x27;s bulky and not very attractive looking but for $30, I didn&#x27;t mind it much. The lights where okay (again, not bad for $30) but not even two weeks of use, the lights went completely out. I was going to look at other reviews for \\&quot;tricks\\&quot; on how to get them working but I don&#x27;t even want to go through the trouble. I should have dished out another $20 or so and got something of much better quality and design, definately not worth the effort of returning/waiting for refund/ordering a replacement. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because I like the larger mirrors.  But overall, I think the design is pretty cheap, the metal bar and plastic piece to stand it up is pretty flimsy.  The sliding light selector on mine doesn&#x27;t work, I almost broke it trying to change the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money to get something better I would definitely recommend doing so.  Next time I will be spending more to get something a little more to my liking.</li>
    <li> I wanted to have a good mirror to apply my makeup in the morning, and after seeing this, with its stand, multi-setting lighting, and plug outlet, I was sold. I just got it yesterday and I am already in love! It&#x27;s great and works so well. It came really fast too. All around happy with it :-)</li>
    <li> What more can I say...the wife loves it. It gives her the right illumination for putting on the correct blend of makeup for morning or evening wear. It works as described, but I gave it four stars because the product is made out of thin plastic (except the mirror). One accident and it will break.</li>
    <li> Great mirror!  My wife loves this mirror and its magnifying ability for putting on her make-up in the morning.  My only concern might be that if a bulb burns out that the end user can&#x27;t replace the bulb.  The directions state that the mirror must be returned for a bulb replacement!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror for my mom for Christmas last year and she loved it.  Before she came for a visit, she asked me to order her another one so I can keep it here for her when she stays with us.  It was hard for her to find one with an outlet for her curling iron, so that&#x27;s just an added plus for this mirror.</li>
    <li> Bottom support kept popping off.  If it isn&#x27;t on the unit, then you have to prop the mirror against something as it won&#x27;t stand by itself.  Also, the bottom support (the &#x27;stand&#x27;) was big and therefore took up a lot of space.  Not a problem for me, but some might not have the room on their vanity to open it up.  Lights were not bright enough for me to see myself.  I liked the side mirrors but they were a bit ackward to use - I&#x27;ll stick with my bathroom mirror and medicine cabinet (mirrored surface that swings out similar to how the Jerdon works) I am happier with my antique Clairol True-to-Light mirror but wanted the side mirrors.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that after less than a year the lights do not work, and changing them is ridiculously difficult. The product is useless without the lights.</li>
    <li> We gave my teen daughter one of these for Christmas.  The electric rocker-type switch would not stay in the ON position - so it went back to the store (local) for exchange.  We tested the replacement in-store, and it was working.  Less than two weeks later, my daughter couldn&#x27;t get the lights to come on.  Perhaps, as another reviewer says, we just need to hold the switch down for awhile (and recite the US Constitution) to warm up the ballast..but we won&#x27;t know, because it has been returned to the store today.  I don&#x27;t have tolerance for finicky (new) appliances.</li>
    <li> Great mirror!  Reminds me of the ones I used in the 60&#x27;s thru late 80&#x27;s!  It has great lighting and the mirror is clear with no distortions.&lt;br /&gt;I still keep a large lighted magnifying mirror next to it though for convenience with closeups as the only con with the Jerdon is you can&#x27;t just pull it up close to your face if you are hunting down that elusive hair, etc :)  Now, I am speaking as a senior gal...I didn&#x27;t need that separate mirror back in the day! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> great product..makes applying makeup so much easier!  Adjustable for day, office, night applications...no more Halloween looks.  Buy it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Why is it that you just cannot find &#x27;good&#x27; makeup mirrors that are pretty?  This one functions fine - the lights are bright and the magnification is adequate.  The issue is that this mirror is just NOT PRETTY.  I have a beautiful antique vanity and this looks dumb sitting on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is bright white plastic.  Plastic.  I am keeping it because it does work, I am just unhappy with the way it looks.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Jerdon mirror from the late  70&#x27;s through the 90&#x27;s and tried to find one the flourescent lights are the best.All other mirrors use the cheap lights that is not true to the home office etc. lighting. I could not believe I found this. If you never had one you do not understand how great they are! I hope they continue making them!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for my daughters for Christmas.  They absolutely love them, especially since the lighting in our home is not really suitable for putting make up on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that has limited mirror space.  This is a nice for the price solution to having a mirror in a small space.  The three sides are very helpful for more than one view and for light reflection.  The magnification is pretty good, not too much but enough to help especially with older eyes. ( all you older people know what I mean)  This is not a high end mirror like in some of the cosmetic stores, but for someone looking for an inexpensive solution for home, I&#x27;d say try it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great for my needs. It faced my expectations very well. I can see every detail on my face, so I&#x27;m perfectly make-uped ecery day :)</li>
    <li> The mirror itself is nice but the quality of the product seems minimal.  It is wobbly and doesn&#x27;t close nicely.  I had an older model that gave out that was well made so ordered the same brand but just doesn&#x27;t seem as well made.  Works for what I need it for and the outlet on it is very convenient as well.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to see that someone still makes a makeup mirror with a plug in it.  The plug outlet is tight but I can still get my blow dryer in it.  It is a good quality mirror.  I love that you have the doors for closing and to see the side of you face and hair.  I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> I really love this vanity, but as others said the lights just don&#x27;t last long. I didn&#x27;t research much into replacing them yet because I read reviews on here saying it is hard to do, but I will eventually. When the lights work this thing is awesome.</li>
    <li> The third time I used this, the light began to fade. It only lights up 1/4 of the way on both sides. Unfortunately, it was purchased more than 30 days ago or I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> ok . to big i think. Very haed to carry with you.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my mil and she loves it</li>
    <li> When I got this mirror last year for Christmas I was really pleased with it. It had different lighting for day, evening, etc. The 5X magnification was perfect so I could apply eye makeup without glasses, which would be impossible. But after about 7-8 months, one of the bulbs became very dim. My husband tried to find a way to take it apart to replace the bulb, but there isn&#x27;t one. All in all it was a waste of money. My old Conair from 20+ years ago still works, but it&#x27;s only 3X magnification. But! I&#x27;m back to using it anyway. Too bad. It had everything I needed, just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend because I have one that I really like. She is really happy with it. I love that light settings. Makes a big difference in what your makeup looks like!</li>
    <li> A little light weight and still wished it was a bit brighter but been happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Nice very nice....My only issue with this is i wish it was heavier because it tends to slide around on the table or counter. It&#x27;s too light weight but other then that i really like this......</li>
    <li> It works well. Happy with it.</li>
    <li> The light on this is not very bright. Sorry do not like this Mirror.</li>
    <li> I like this product okay. It is not as nice as my old GE was. This one has more controls and choices.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I would have given it a five if it were a little brighter.</li>
    <li> this mirror sucks, doesn&#x27;t light up and was high cost for nothing</li>
    <li> The tri-fold is O.K.  The mirror is more like a reflective metal rather than an actual mirror.  It also tips a little possibly because of the rotating center mirror.  I use it everyday and it will do.  I didn&#x27;t send it back because I use it everyday and didn&#x27;t want the bother.  I do love the convenient outlet because I can plug my appliances into it.</li>
    <li> after trying two of these and having my wife and two daughters all say it was like a funhouse mirror I have decided to ask for my money back. If you got a good one consider yourself lucky. Remember buy your wife or daughters good stuff and you&#x27;ll be a hero, buy garbage and no one is going to be happy.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  I was forced to create a new make up space after moving in with the boyfriend but I prefer my new set up to the bathroom anyway!  I put a couple of nails up and firmly taped the bar to the mirror and used the bar to hang the mirror above my dresser. It works perfectly and he and I are no longer on 15 minute intervals for the bathroom during our morning routine  :-D</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product. The lights are not bright enough. Bulky and awkward to store.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it a 1 is there is no 0 star.</li>
    <li> I had a mirror like this long ago and it got lost in my cross-country move. I&#x27;ve gone through several magnifying mirrors since, all non-lighted, and although they weren&#x27;t awful, they just didn&#x27;t compare. This mirror rules. Hands down. I can finally see again when I tweeze my brows.</li>
    <li> My husband is unable to stand at a sink to use the bathroom mirror to shave so this was a most needed item.  It fits the billl and operates as described.  As usual, this item came from Amazon in record order and was as described.  I had checked out other mirrors in stores and by internet and knew what to expect.  The price at Amazon was very good considering what I found in stores and on oine website on the Internet it was double the Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!! Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it and used it for 1 1/2 months and now the lights won&#x27;t work properly. Since I purchased it in November, I can&#x27;t return it. Very sad! Don&#x27;t buy this unless you purchase it from a reputable company with at least a year warranty.</li>
    <li> The magnifying mirror in the center is so distorted, I can&#x27;t use it.  My eyesight isn&#x27;t great for putting on eyeliner, etc. so this is why I use a lighted magnifying mirror.  I would not recommend this one.</li>
    <li> the lighting was good but the mirrors were awful.  The regular side of it made your face look small and far away, the magnified side was very distorted and actually made me nauseous unless i liked directly straight ahead and not move my head at all!.  The side mirrors were fine.  Had to send it back could not use it without getting a queasy stomach.  Went back to my Conair mirror, mirror is great the lighting is so so.</li>
    <li> Product has a cheap feel about it.  The switch to adjust the lighting very chintzy and in fact, doesn&#x27;t work properly.  It won&#x27;t go to the last setting.  I&#x27;d return it except it simply isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose I guess but I do not like the unrealistic lighting.</li>
    <li> I have  bought several  of these lighted  makeup mirrors.  When one dies, I get another. They are perfect  for my use.</li>
    <li> Unit is so nice I shopped for a table to accommodate the unit, gift for wife and she is extremely happy.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best lighted makeup mirror that is avaible. I really like the choices of the different lighting features offered. I plugged mine in and went through the different lighting options until I found the one that worked best for my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another positive is the extra plugs for hair curler or hair straightner. That&#x27;s awesome! Especially since you have to have this plugged in and wall outlets are limited where my makeup vanity sits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave a three star review is because of the look.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative that I can say for this is the way it looks. It looks really outdated. The white is kind of an off white and the color choices for the lighting options look like they are from the 80&#x27;s. I think that Jerdon needs to do a style update.</li>
    <li> I needed something to replace a broken mirror and I am so glad that I chose this one.  The different lights are great and I enjoy the magnifying side too.</li>
    <li> I just bought a new vanity and I just wanted a good mirror for when I do my make up. This mirror is amazing. I love how you can adjust the lighting at the bottom and I love that the mirror can be folded. Ladies, you know when you&#x27;re plucking you need a good mirror and good lighting. This provides both. It does the job and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> i makeup in front of my mirror every morning so i dont have to turn the lights to bother my husband  before i go to work.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people that apply make-up to their face because the middle mirror, side mirrors and lighting makes it easier to see the entire face for a good make-up application.</li>
    <li> The mirror is not of a good quality and the magnification is not clear. This mirror is made out of very cheap plastic and not sturdy at all. I am sending it back. Save your money.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased a Jerdon JGL9W to replace her 20 year old Clairol \\&quot;True To Light\\&quot; makeup mirror which had worn-out hinges.  The Jerdon worked fine at first, then the lights began to flicker, and finally quit altogether.  I was extremely disappointed to see the \\&quot;do not open - no user serviceable parts inside\\&quot; notation on the case - in my opinion, this statement is a scam by manufacturers to force replacement of repairable products.  I finally discovered that the four phillips screws that hold the case together are concealed by small round plastic covers on the back side. Carefully drill or punch a hole in each cover and they pop out.  There is no need to replace them.  The bulbs use slide-on terminals rather than sockets, and are held in place with fiber retainers, which have to be released from plastic tabs.  It turned out that the bulbs are OK in my wife&#x27;s unit, but the ballast is open and the switch works poorly.  I saw in another post that the manufacturer is replacing these units, so we will try that route, but will never again buy a product from a manufacturer that tries to make bulb replacement impossible in an illuminated product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW-UP: Jerdon promptly replaced the make-up mirror, and the replacement is still working.  However, the new unit has the same issue with bulbs - the manufacturer has made it nearly impossible for the owner to replace them.  Why??</li>
    <li> I love the 3 mirrors, great for styling my hair. Takes a while to get used to the different colors of lighting for makeup application.</li>
    <li> Returned because it didn&#x27;t magnify correctly it was distorted.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because there were alot of reviews online saying it was the closest thing to the Clairol &amp;#34;True to Light&amp;#34; make-up mirrors from the &#x27;80&#x27;s and &#x27;90&#x27;s.  I found that, at least on the daylight setting which is supposed to emulate bright dayight, that in fact it is NOT as clear and bright a light as the Clairol mirrors used to be.  I think it has something to do with the color filters that change with the different light settings.  When set for the brightest setting, part of the colored filter is still facing forward for the other settings and it dims the daytime setting somewhat.  It is hard to believe that no other manufacturer has been able to replicate the Clairol mirrors as, from what I read on the Internet, there is still a big demand for something comparable.</li>
    <li> This is my second mirror in the same style - my last one lasted 25+ years!  I like how the doors fold closed to hide the mirror when not in use and the magnification is really good without being extreme (some mirrors I checked out were scary).  The bulbs light up quickly when turned on and the 4 illumination choices are a nice addition.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very nice and has good lighting i have three girls at home that use makeup and when they seen this mirror and tryed it out i was back on amazon ordering 3 more so that should tell you something  think about it If she ordered 1 then 3  more it must be good  ..I have looked around for makeup mirrors and the prices are very high  when I came across this mirror from jerdon I thought I would give it a try and i&#x27;m glad I did ....</li>
    <li> This replaced my old one which was over 20- years old. I hope this one lasts as long. So far it works great and I have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> VERY upset this doesnt have enough LIGHT.  goodness. it would be great if it lit up enough. guess i chose the wrong product. you need light to put on make up. i put it on the hightest light and still not enough light. i am going to try and get my money back.</li>
    <li> Perfect or all my beauty needs</li>
    <li> perfect &amp; works great!</li>
    <li> The light is very poor. Only one side seems to shine. Not anywhere as good as my previous mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the other side light went out. DO NOT BUY this lighted mirror. It is very poor.</li>
    <li> Very good lighting and I like that one side of the mirror is magnified.  Great mirror!  Get one for yourself and one as a present.</li>
    <li> i received my item and is GREAT!!! i keep it on a max of 1 hour per day.  With that being said i expected it to last longer than 11months.  Yup thats all i got was 11 months of usage. But for $30 i decided to by another (because i did like it). Hopefully this one last me longer.  The lights just wouldnt stay on anymore, worked for like 30seconds then would go off. Sigh</li>
    <li> This hasn&#x27;t been used yet as it is a Christmas present for my youngest grand-daughter. It seems to be the same model as one we&#x27;d gotten for her mom when she was a teen ager.  It worked so well that she took it with her when she got married. It lasted for 20 years!  My grand-daughter has a vanity but the mirror is too far away to put on make-up so she &#x27;s been improvising with a desk lamp. If it&#x27;s anything like her mom&#x27;s, it will be fantastic. I remember her mom&#x27;s well. The side lights, the magnification, lighting choices.&lt;br /&gt;I read all the negative reviews and bought it anyway. I&#x27;m not worried about it.  I&#x27;m sure it will be perfect.  I&#x27;ll update this review after she uses it a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been having trouble finding a mirror that had bright enough lighting, they were all dim or shadowy.  This one is perfect!  The brightest setting allows me to see details and the other settings allow a view of colors/shading.  I love it!</li>
    <li> She wanted this type for a long time . Got it for her birthday and she is very happy with it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting but it is very light. Lighter than expected! I love this product because when I finish i get so many compliments on my makeup. Ive heard that I look airbrushed!</li>
    <li> The item came early.  My mom loved it for her Christmas Gift.  She loved the 5X Magnification.  This will definately replace the one she recevied 15 years ago.</li>
    <li> Okay, it&#x27;s not on a wall. And I&#x27;m not the fairest of them all. However, it works exactly for what I purchased it for. Good lighting and magnification to see up close when needed. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> opened box- pluged in- didnt work..was given credit - threw away!  Looled brand new but guess it was not because boc was tapped and was all dented</li>
    <li> The lights stopped working after less than three months.  (Too late to return it, of course!!)  Cheap plastic, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the variety of lighting options! Now I know how I look both in natural and office work lights.</li>
    <li> The lighting is not the best quality, but the mirror is nice, sturdy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one, first one was purchased June 20ll, the lights started to flicker and turn off, 3yrs isn&#x27;t bad but I did expect it to work like my last one which was 10 yrs. The second one was defective, the magnified 2 sided mirror was beveled and distorted like one of those carnival attractions with the room full of mirrors. When it works properly it is a very good product, thats why I keep buying another, but I think this is my last attempt at this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  I love the dual middle mirror.  Just rotate it to a magnified mirror.  Lighting is excellent.  I have had mine 2 years and no problems.</li>
    <li> Bought this product many  years ago. Just bought my second one to keep at our second home. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the bulbs. I use my mirror everyday and have never had to replace any bulbs.</li>
    <li> Perfect for putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> Your service was fast, the mirror was totally affordable and works really great!</li>
    <li> Great, the everyone I wanted!!!!  It is working, no problems , made good.  This is my second mirrow one in 8 years and I use it daily</li>
    <li> Bought this Jerdon mirror in January 2013 in spite of all the reviews complaining about the bulbs burning out. Today almost six months later, the bulbs burned out. Sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift so I can&#x27;t rate it personally. Just gave it to the person I purchased it for today, so have no actual info. on the rating.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Windmere brand and didn&#x27;t think any other brand could compare.  The Jerdon is excellent.  And I love the 5x mirrow option.  If the Jerdon Last as long as my Windmere (15 years) the five stars will be 6 stars.  Today I would reccomend your product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it</li>
    <li> The size, lights,  and weight are good, but the magnification of the mirror is distorted. I am disappointed in product.</li>
    <li> Very helpful for middle aged eyes!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this mirror. I find that I can apply makeup much more easily when there is a direct light on my face. However, the structure of this item itself is not as strong as I had hoped; I have to keep it propped just right or it will topple over, which tends to happen rather frequently. All in all, though, it is a good product for people trying to get close details such as applying eye makeup.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend could not use it not even once. It&#x27;s damaged now. The bulbs only turned on like 2 or 3 times. We work s dancers and we travel a lot. Right now we te in Colombia so... Is very hard and expensive to return the item from here. I would like to know how to do to claim the guarantee. I am very upset about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a makeup mirror user for more than thirty years and this is my second Jerdon Tri-fold.  The first one I had for more than a decade and it worked perfectly the entire time.  The only reason I had to replace it is because one of the side mirrors was broken on a trip.  The bulbs never had to be replaced.  The new one I just bought here on Amazon is lighter weight and I don&#x27;t have to hold the button down to make the bulbs light.  Every now and then, one of the bulbs seems a little wonky, so I just turn it off and on again and it&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s the brightest makeup mirror you&#x27;ll find and the price is great.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this item.  I have had it less than one year, and it has died.  The lights no longer work and apparently you cannot replace the bulbs. Seems it has no replaceable parts.  Had I know that, I would not have purchased it.  For the price, it certainly should have lasted long than a few months.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> The light is nice and bright…however the mirror is distorted and not magnified enough for me. I&#x27;ll have to keep it since I threw the box away but I&#x27;d exchange it otherwise.</li>
    <li> This mirror is excellent! There are zero problems starting the lights up, ever.. The illumination is great. And the 4 shades of lighting are labeled, spot on, and have served me well. It is exactly what a make up mirror should be.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror from Amazon after studying reviews etc, last year in June, and it traveled with me to Europe for a month. I was careful to use it with a converter specifically bought to use with it. No problems. Back home for several months and all was fine. Yesterday, lights out! No lights. Without lights this is a useless mirror, or triple mirror. Trash it? I guess. It&#x27;s one of those items that if it doesn&#x27;t work, throw it out. I am very disappointed for I had hoped to use it at least five years before a black out. But, NO!</li>
    <li> I use the Jerdon trifold mirror to apply makeup or for any close up detail work that needs my attention.&lt;br /&gt;Jerdon has the best true image and magnification of any mirror I&#x27;ve owned and I have owned three Jerdon Classics over the last 30 years -  I always come back for more when one is needed. It gives great front and side views and folds up for easy storing. What more can one ask for? A very resonable price for a pretty me - See.....miracles do happen.</li>
    <li> I really like this tri-fold mirror, and was very unhappy when, after a little more than 1 year, the lights burned out.  And even unhappier when I learned that I would have to send this to the manufacturer for them to replace the lights.  Really?  No, I don&#x27;t believe I will do that.  I was hopeful that by holding the on button down for 10 seconds as suggested by another reviewer would work, but the light is definitely burned out.  I was not pleased with the selection of lighted make-up mirrors at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, which is where I originally purchased this mirror.  So, I figured this was useless without the lights anyway, I may as well open it up to see if I could replace the lights.  On the back of the mirror case, there are 4 indentations that cover the screws, and once you pop them out, the screw heads are visible.  Unscrew with a philip&#x27;s head driver, but be careful when you take the back off to prevent damaging the light filter.  I never used the variable lighting, only the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting, so I just removed the rotating lenses to access the tube.  The tubes are easily removed by pulling the copper connections off.  The florescent tube replacement is F6T5/CW (CW is for cool white, brighter than soft white).  I paid $6.19 for each tube.  Plug in the tubes, close the unit, and screw it together, and voila!  You have a great make-up mirror.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this mirror and decided to go with this one because of the ratings and price.  I was scared that some people had problems with the bulbs but we have had this one a year now, and my 15 year old uses every single day so it has held up wonderfully, very good product and purchase!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this mirror.  After less than 1 year of use both light bulbs in the mirror have died.</li>
    <li> Not going to waste much time on this. Bottom line. ITS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH! I threw away the box and before I knew it my dog ate it and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these last year and loved it! After extensive use, the light switch broke and the lights wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore (not from the bulbs) so instead of changing out the switch I decided this would be my Mother&#x27;s Day present to myself. I was so excited to receive it in the mail. I am a makeup artist, so this mirror is great for work, travel and personal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box, immediately there were differences. The lights were dimmer and flickering. The logo was different. The mirror made my face look super wide and off color. No woman wants a wider face!!! Everything was different! After a closer look, I discovered that this was a cheap Chinese replica. I think the original was made in China too but this was a Chinese replica of a Chinese product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back and received a prompt refund, so thanks for that. However I want my original mirror back!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! My mom had one like this back in the 70s and I have always wanted one. Although some of the reviews are bad, I took the plunge anyway... and I am so glad that I did! All the mirrors are clear and are no way distorted. The center mirror, the regular and 5x, flips up/down versus sideways or Left/Right. It&#x27;s one of the only mirrors that does this. All the lighting levels are perfect, not too bright and not too dim. Overall... it&#x27;s a great Tri-Fold mairror! Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews deter you. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> My last one the light switch broke, so I bought a new one on Amazon prime. Same brand but this new one is way better. It came really fast.love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this mirror. Super fast shipping!! Ty</li>
    <li> This cosmetic mirror is just what I wanted for my new vanity.  The additional lights (there are four settings) are fun to use and seem pretty accurate.</li>
    <li> I was unhappy with this product due to the light quality.  I had read other reviews noting the light quality, however, that is an individual preference.  For me, at my age ... it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have always had a Remington Lighted Mirror, had it at least 6 yrs.It quit, So I couldn&#x27;t find a Remington, and had to order this one, I&#x27;m not as happy with it..Its lighting is not as bright, and I&#x27;m just not happy with it, but had to replace the Remington..I will actually find one so I can look at it next time..</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas present for my girfriend. She uses it every day. A great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and let me just say that it&#x27;s a must even if you travel alot. You can pack it with you.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for Christmas</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it.  It is a gift I haven&#x27;t given yet - but I am a little bit disappointed in the quality. It looks cheap. Crummy plastic. Not sure I still want to give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I got this for my vanity table because my table sits in front of a window so I don&#x27;t have the ability to put up a large mirror on the wall.  So I looked all over for a mirror that would sit on the table that I also had a light to it because I get up early before the sun is up, and it can get kinda dark in my room.  First off, the 5x magnification is terrible.  If you are looking for a mirror for the magnification aspect....go with a different mirror.  You can&#x27;t really use it unless you are super close to is.  The curve in the mirror makes it look like a circus mirror.  The lighting of the mirror is not really that great.  It has some really weird settings that give you awful light.  The best thing is the regular mirrors.  I like having the two side mirrors and the main mirror size is pretty good.  I guess for the price it isn&#x27;t a bad unit....but it was kind of disappointing.</li>
    <li> The light adjuster broke when my girl fiend tried to use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror because I wanted better lighting while applying my makeup and based on the reviews I read I had high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the lighting, it is not bright enough. The mirror its self is a nice size and the wing panels are convenient. I would return this mirror if I knew of another model that has brighter lights.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror with a regular and a magnifying option and great lighting. I especially like the plug on the front that I use for my blow dryer. The only negative is the odd type of prop in the back that takes up too much space behind the mirror. It is not a huge problem but limits the position on my dresser.</li>
    <li> All I can say is \\&quot;I love this mirror!\\&quot; I have always wanted a lighted makeup mirror, but couldn&#x27;t find one with good reviews. This is the ticket. The lights are bright, there is a difference between all four settings and they all are beautiful. The magnifying side is just right at 5X. It is large but I like that. It would fit nicely on a makeup table (which I don&#x27;t have.) I need to set it up each time I use it, but I find it worth the effort. I don&#x27;t know anything about changing the lights because I havn&#x27;t had a problem with them. But I know that every dollar you spend on this model is justified and worth it.</li>
    <li> Guys, I didn&#x27;t even realize that I bought it 3 years ago until I went to see the history of my orders on Amazon. Never had any problem with this mirror and lights r still working !!! This mirror is a big help to me. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> About one month after receiving this as a gift the lights completely stopped working.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product less than a year ago. One light has almost went out and the other is weak. I tried holding down the on/off button. No work for me. Not a good deal at all. At this point I really don&#x27;t know one that is. I just need a lighted mirror that is going to last longer and work better than this one did.</li>
    <li> Listen to the negative reviews and don&#x27;t purchase this mirror. I want to replace a very old and beaten-up Remington mirror that is terrible looking but still works like a champ (but isn&#x27;t made anymore, sadly), so I ordered this mirror hoping I would side with the positive reviews. I only had to plug it in once to see that it doesn&#x27;t emit half the light of the one I am replacing, and the magnifying mirror is unclear and distorted compared to the Remington. I am over 50 and my vision is getting a lot worse, and this mirror does nothing to help me see my face more clearly; there are only disadvantages to its use. It appears cheaply made and there&#x27;s no way to hang it on the wall, either. Terribly disappointed, and frustrated too. This mirror is being returned! It was manufactured to resemble my old one, but is nothing but a cheap imitation.</li>
    <li> All in all I like the product. It works well for what I need. The light is not as bright as I think I would like it to be.. But keeping it on the day setting dose the trick. Worth the money. Shipped fast and came in great shape. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> The magnified mirror is really warbled.  You pretty much have to get right up next to it for it to become clear enough to use.  Also, my light switch doesn&#x27;t move.  It is stuck on the middle setting &amp; won&#x27;t budge.  Since this lighting is adequate for the most part, I chose not to send it back.  My luck on Amazon with just about ANY &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; device has been a bust.  Getting tired of having to send things back.  QC could definitely use some work.</li>
    <li> I am pretty disappointed with the mirror. I purchased the mirror because a lot the reviews mentioned that the light was very bright which was definitely something that I was looking for. But sadly, the light wasn&#x27;t that bright. There are multiple settings on the mirror that allow one to control the lighting (day, office, evening, home). I exclusively use the home setting because I think it&#x27;s the brightest setting but even then it&#x27;s not bright enough. I find myself going back and forth to the mirror in the bathroom which is surprisingly brighter than this mirror. The only reason why I continue to use this mirror is because all my makeup is right next to it and when I turn on all the lights in the room, I find this mirror to be acceptable. The magnification is also not very good although it is acceptable. In addition to the poor lighting, the mirror is way too small. Again, I had to use this mirror in conjunction with my large, well lit bathroom mirror in order to get good make up application. The bottom line is, if you&#x27;re someone who applies makeup every day and have the money to splurge on something nicer I would.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because my sweetheart wanted it and when she received the product it had no flaws at all it was shipped with no damages to the box or anything also we received the product an day earlier than expected we satisfied. I will most definely will purchase from these guys again</li>
    <li> Has made me look much better.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror for my wife&#x27;s birthday.  She loves it and looks forward to using it every day, however, after a week and a half of using this lighted mirror, the fuse sparked and burned in close proximity of her face. I am in the process of getting it returned as it&#x27;s still within 30 day period. I gave this a 3 star because of how much my wife loved it. It&#x27;s just inconvenient to mail it back for exchange.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the mirror lights.  One of them did not last 8 months.  Funny thing is my sister still have the makeup mirror made by the same company that we had a teenagers and it is still &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; strong.  That was the reason I bought this one in the first place.  Just goes to show &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t make them like they used to&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to buy this for her so I did.  3 weeks later she threw it away.  Flimsy, unstable and basically poorly made.  I would not recommend it.  Spend a few more dollars and get something else.</li>
    <li> Had to search a long time for this type of mirror. Love it, good price and would buy again. Perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for it as well as I did my old Clairol that I&#x27;d used for years.  I&#x27;ll just need to get used to this one.  I like the side mirrors, the auxiliary electrical outlet on the front.  It&#x27;s easy to turn on and adjust the type of light.  The large center mirror rotates from reg. size to magnified from top to bottom rather side to side so I&#x27;ll have to get used to that.  As soon as I get used to it, I&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! it has a very good zoom! I&#x60;m very happy with this product! The lights is very good! The sell has a very good comunication!</li>
    <li> The magnification mirror was distorted.  It was difficult to see in it.  I had the exact same one for 2 years and the bulbs burned out.  I ordered one online through Amazon.com and it came defective.  Sent it back.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me as a Christmas gift, Paid 4 maybe 5 dollar extra for the next day delivery. It was never here. Extremely disappointed, The item itself is beautiful Just like I always wanted. Just wish It was here when we paid for it to be</li>
    <li> This is my third mirror.  My only recommendation is it would be nice to be able to change the bulbs when they burn out, rather than to have to buy a new mirror.</li>
    <li> had this mirror for a week and took it back.  It was very cheap looking and the light was just plain weird to me. I did not like how you the light changed for different times of the day.  Everything about it seemed cheap.  Not bright enough either.</li>
    <li> The lighting is good and you have different options of light. The magnifying mirror is clear and I was able to finally see what I needed too and still use both hands.</li>
    <li> I love the mirror, but the lighting button came in broken, I think it is too fragile. For the mean time it works for its purpose and for the price it is good, but I cant change the light setting.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for those with problems with site, and great for everyday use, two thumbs up!  Great</li>
    <li> my daughter loved it. she spends countless ours in front ofit. it keeps her out of my room. thank you.</li>
    <li> I had looked &amp; bought other mirrors, but the light was not bright enough.  The light is very bright &amp; exactly what I was looking for.  My daughter &amp; I are very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I had a Remington makeup mirror for about a decade. The light went out a few months ago so I bought new bulbs. Long story short I think it was an electrical/wiring problem so I was without a light up makeup mirror for almost 2 months. I finally caved and realized I had to buy a new one, but Remington doesn&#x27;t sell them anymore. I researched all the amazon reviews and chose this Jerdon Tri-fold. I love it. It&#x27;s very bright, it lights up quickly (don&#x27;t have to hold down the button like some models) and it has 4 light settings. I recommend it for anyone who likes to do their own makeup!</li>
    <li> This unit takes up a lot of space and the lighting filters for various conditions was was a bit hokey. Never the less it is usable.</li>
    <li> Nicely made, easily stored, works great, well worth your money. May have to buy another as my teen keeps stealing it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I just wish there was a easy way to store it because the stands in the back keep falling down and I have to make sure cord is wrapped around it tight and quickly put in back in the vanity.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup mirror. I like that it is big, it moves well, and that there is a 5 times magnification along with the standard. The 10 times magnification almost make up mirrors have is way to magnified and you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing. It does have different light settings, however they seem to me to just be ridiculous. The normal light works great I take this with me wherever I go! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> got this for my wife she seems to like it an says it has good lighting well made not to cheap unless shes just being nice lol</li>
    <li> It looks like the mirror is a fun house mirror! They used to be good but it looks like they have tried to increase their profits by buying a cheaper product and now it is going to cost them sales. I purchased two mirrors because I like my old one and both of them are distorted so back they go.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to purchase anyway since most people had luck with holding the button down, etc... Unfortunately, 2 weeks after I received it, the lights no longer work.  The on/off switch is also not a button that you can hold down, it clicks into place and holding it does nothing.  Even though it did not turn on, I left it in the on position the day it stopped working and it turned on half way through the night.  I turned it off hoping that in the morning it would turn on again, but has not since.  When it worked, it was great.  Unfortunately, wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase of just two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Lighting is kind of odd and came with a sticker apologizing for the fact that sometimes the lights will flicker or not turn on. The note recommends you turn it off and on. Not the best endorsement from the manufacturers! In hind sight I should have returned it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my pre-teen granddaughter. She is so excited with the mirror. She loves the idea of the built in outlet, also. She will be able to use this mirror into her adulthood. Great gift for young girls and women, too.</li>
    <li> This mirror worked for three months before suddenly, the lights no longer worked on it.</li>
    <li> A great idea -- three different angles to check your face and makeup ... along with various types of lighting.  Great in theory but execution is a fail.  Unless your dressing table, counter or desk is chest high,  this mirror is too low or short to properly see your face and make-up at a decent angle.  The support bracket in the back is too flimsy to hold the mirror and its open panels in a stable manner.  Too low and you are putting on your makeup looking up your nostrils the whole time.  Too high and the mirror wants to fall forward.  Too precarious to be useful.  It is also not a brightly lit appliance - so the advantage of being able to see your make up in various lighting situations is rather diluted by the room lighting you need to be able to do a good job on your make-up.  Would not purchase again.  Even with someone else&#x27;s money.</li>
    <li> We purchased this item because my wife recently underwent cataract procedure and needed the magnified light source.  This is a very well made mirror that is not what I would call &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34;  The lighting is more than adequate and it folds for storage in a clever manner as well as stands up when being used.  Good product.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Had this for about a week when it just quit working. No way to fix it, so I&#x27;m stuck with a product that is just a mirror.</li>
    <li> I do not understand the bad reviews. I have had this mirror for months and it is just great. It replaced an old one I had had for many years that served me well until it died. This one is so much better than the old one. The light and magnification are great. The two side mirrors are not necessary though. I have had it for five months and have had no problems with it. I think it is very well made.</li>
    <li> The lights are not bright at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> All in all this is a good mirror.  The lighting lasted a good 3 1/2 years before they eventually went, and instead of having them replaced I just bought a second one because it&#x27;s probably cheaper.  I do wish the cord was a little longer and that the plastic part on the bottom that keeps the mirror propped up was stronger, although luckily for me it broke around the same time the bulbs began to flicker and die out.</li>
    <li> Best magnifying makeup mirror I found but lighting a bit &amp;#34;glary,&amp;#34; &amp; I since the mirror doesn&#x27;t rotate side to side, I have to turn entire product to see sides of face.</li>
    <li> Lasted less than a year</li>
    <li> Too glary no matter the setting.</li>
    <li> I love having a mirror with lights, but unless you have the tilted back further than I&#x27;d like it to be, it tends to want to tip forward a bit.  Also, the lighting seems a bit strange.  I doubt that would be different on other mirrors, so I&#x27;m not that concerned about it.  It does often leave me with &#x27;stripes&#x27; in my vision after use, but I have super sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this mirror twice.  The first time I bought one, I got it at Ulta.  One of the lights had a dark spot when I plugged it in.  The mirror worked for a while, maybe three months, with lots of flickering, before it quit completely.  I bought another one, thinking the first bad mirror had been a fluke.  My mirror is less than a year old.  Friday, the lights began flickering. Two days later, it won&#x27;t turn on. Don&#x27;t bother trying to contact the company, either. They don&#x27;t answer their phone or return phone calls or e-mails.</li>
    <li> This make up mirror is perfect for my needs. It is light to pack. The 5x magnification is so helpful and I don&#x27;t have to have my contacts in to complete my make up. It is a great buy!</li>
    <li> This mirror has a metal stand that kicks out to help it stand up except it just folds all the time. It doesn&#x27;t stand up at all. I am not sure if its broken or what but its pointless to me if it can&#x27;t stand up.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a lighted mirror for several years. When relatives moved tin while they were getting back on their feet, the bathroom was always in use so ordered this. It is great. I set it up on a desk and there is a place to plug in a hair dryer or curling iron.  The mirror on one side magnifies which is great for eye liner.</li>
    <li> This is such an awesome product. I look forward to putting on makeup every day! It&#x27;s a perfect size to have on a vanity, it&#x27;s reliable, and the light settings are really a nice touch. I also love how you can just flip the middle mirror and have the 5x magnification. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m Mrs. Adalis, just using my husbands account to review. I&#x27;ve used this fold-out type of mirror for 30+ years, going through many brands in the process. I prefer the fold-out mirrors over a single middle or round, lit mirror because the side panels allow you to see the sides of your face and inside your ears. Laugh, but everyone in my family uses my mirror to see these areas occasionally, my husband uses it daily to shave and it can be used to see your back (which is how I discovered a suspicious mole years ago). The magnifying mirror is really great for seeing EVERYTHING- sometimes it&#x27;s scary! This model is the best currently available, but it could be GREATLY improved by changing the hinges from the sides to the top and bottom on the middle panel to allow the middle mirror to swivel left and right. Currently the mirror only swivels top to bottom which doesn&#x27;t allow you to use the side panels to see in your ears or sides of your face or your back very well. No need for side hinges as height of mirror can easily be adjusted with the arm and groove in the back of mirror. Jerdon, are you listening?</li>
    <li> Its just what I need to cut my hair, I wish the side mirrors were a little bit wider but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Nice product timely delivery</li>
    <li> This mirror works great.  I really like the various light settings.  The magnification works great as well.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this product.</li>
    <li> After much searching and a few disappointments, I am glad I finally found this functional lighted makeup mirror.  Jerdon actually created a makeup mirror combination that does exactly what it should do.  This mirror combo provides good lighting and two distortion free mirrors in an adjustable design of adequate size at a reasonable price.  It is as though this makeup mirror was designed by person who actually applies makeup.  The overall size is about 9.75 x 12 inches and fits nicely on my small vanity.  The mirrors are about 6 x 7.5 inches, so even the 5x side is big enough to show my face where I apply makeup. I have long hair, so it wold take a large mirror to show my whole head.  Now that I wear reading glasses the 5x side is helpful.  The fluorescent lamps provide plenty of glare free illumination in the dark corner where my vanity sits.  The bulbs remain cool to touch when lighted, which is a definite plus for makeup application.  I hope this lasts many years.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my wife who used it once and then both bulbs blew out.  Couldn&#x27;t open plastic case to access bulbs ($7.00 each) to replace them - then saw little imprint on plastic case which stated that an experienced electrician was needed to change them.  Now, let&#x27;s figure this one out....a product that costs $23.00 will require an electrician at a minimum of $80.00 per hour to replace two $7.00 bulbs.  Web site printed on paperwork that came with the mirror doesn&#x27;t list Jerdon ... toll free phone to reach the company is either continually busy or no one answers.  Could this be a major rip-off...duh...think so.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m willing to give these folks any more of my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and this is the only mirror I will ever use!  It gives the most natural light possible for to you create a flawless face.</li>
    <li> Good idea, but the recipient of this gift could not see with it. The lights were too dim, and she said it was like a carnival fun house mirror, Distorted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids might be able to use it.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the positive comments about this mirror, I was excited to have found it.  The excitement went away, however, once I tried to use it.  The plug kept tripping the outlet off and it&#x27;s somewhat awkward getting it to light up.  The bulbs flicker for a bit before they stay lighted.  Also, the magnification mirror on the flip side is not large enough for a 5x magnification.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with this mirror at all and am returning it for a refund.  Wish I had never bought it.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s makeup mirror lost much of the mirroring material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, she needed a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is similar to the older style type I bought for her as a gift many years ago from Basco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Very large triple makeup mirror with two Bright 9 watt flourescent light tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18 Watt Florescent &#x3D; about 100 Watts incandescent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO, Appears to be one of the brightest makeup mirror avalable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the ConAirs and we almost purchased one of the round styles with the light inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(but I realized they are not very bright)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carefully read the negative reviews about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why I had to take a chance and buy this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews that caught my attention were that you need a professional electrical person to replace the bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the reviewers that mentioned that the bulbs burned out after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some electrical experience with light tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife told me the bulbs burned out right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came in and had to have a quick look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, The lights are not burned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is the light is manufactured with the old fashion preheat ballast tubes. (old reliable technology)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to light the bulbs you must hold the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; switch DOWN for 5 to ten seconds then the lights light and you let go of the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light bulbs are very bright and should work well for years if you do not damage or drop the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife complains that she has to hold the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; button down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the mirror is indeed extremely bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck if you buy this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my tip helps you.</li>
    <li> I had searched every where to replace a mirror similar to this that I had for 15 years.  Initally tempted to buy the name brand the bargain hunter in me opted for this model.  And I am glad I did.  This is a very good mirror. Altho priced lower than other comparable mirrors this model is excellent with more flexibility in folding the side mirrors out.  I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for about 3 months now.  At first I was skeptical of it based on other reviews but then I saw one at a local store and it seemed fine.  I ordered it through Amazon because it was cheaper but kept the box in case some of those reviews were acurate.  I&#x27;m happy to say I didn&#x27;t need to keep the box.  The light workd perfectly, magnafication is just right, and the light is bright but not too bright.  You do have to hold the button for a few seeconds for the light to come on and there is a sticker on it that tells you this.  Some people complainmed about this but it&#x27;s no big deal to me.  It can be used at many angles and looks sleek either open or closed.</li>
    <li> This replaces a similar mirror I&#x27;ve used for many, many years. The fluorescent light is by far superior to any incandescent lighted mirror which gets too hot and yet still has light that&#x27;s too dim. I&#x27;m use to holding the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch down about 3 seconds to turn on the light. That&#x27;s no problem. The fact that they make it difficult to replace bulbs is an annoying and stupid design feature. I trust that when the time comes, my husband, who has done electrical work, will figure it out. I myself changed bulbs in my old mirror that was a different brand. Overall I&#x27;m very happy to have found this. I&#x27;ve looked around for several years without success. It was delivered on time and the description was correct.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the old type of make-up mirror that used to be widely available. The new round and oval mirrors don&#x27;t hold a candle to this mirror. Before purchasing this mirror I had purchased and returned two others because of insufficient light. This mirror has plenty of magnification and light!&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted with this item!</li>
    <li> This mirror is a great replacement for my Clairol True to Light makeup mirror which I have had since college.  It has an even more powerful magnifying mirror...useful in middle age if you don&#x27;t check out the wrinkles!  So far I&#x27;m delighted with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I really love my new Tri-fold mirror.  It has everything I was looking for.  The 3 mirrors lets me see the back of my head if I need to.  The lighting is great and the magnified mirror is really close up to see all those imperfections!!  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this exact mirror approx. 8 yrs ago. I had taken it to Cuba on holidays and when i returned it didnt work anymore. I am guessing because i had to use a electrical converter. I was thrilled to find it on amazon.com for a very reasonable price. Thank you</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t pay attention to the reviews about the bad bulbs. That user was not holding the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch down long enough.  I had a lighted mirror exactly like this one for 20+ years and it finally broke. I panicked, thinking I would never find another just like it.  I found it on Amazon and it arrived and works beautifully, just like my old faithful mirror. I&#x27;m so very pleased. It&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This mirror was purchased after buying 2 lighted mirrors locally and being disappointed.  This mirror gives off more light and is sturdy. I would highly recommend this mirror to a friend.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality. My wife returned it as soon as she plugged it in. The built in lights were dim and cheap.</li>
    <li> I like this particular lighted mirror because of the way the mirror turns.  There are a very limited number of lighted make up mirrors on the market and most of them don&#x27;t light up enough or the mirror swivels from side to side instead of from top to bottom which is what I prefer.  I have had a previous model make up mirror that finally quit which is why I was in the market for a new one.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I AM so glad I didn&#x27;t let a few bad ratings prevent me from buying this mirror...I love it..Lighting is fantastic ...Mirrors are a plus.I would definitely encourage others to buy it and give it try...Thanks JERDON....</li>
    <li> All that I asked for in a makeup mirror, especially like the way the mirrow flips from regular to magnifier</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife as a replacement for her old makeup mirror that was falling apart after many. many years of service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it.  The light is much brighter than her previous one which is also a major plus.  She didn&#x27;t think having the side mirrors would matter, but has found she really likes them.  When you factor in the price, this was definitely a 5-star purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  So many different favors in one seasoning.  I use it on fish, baked potatoes, salad.  It gives the zip of flavor to make things great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother. She&#x27;s very particular about her makeup mirrors and told me about this one. It&#x27;s a bit bulky for traveling so I bought her own to keep at my place for when she visits.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my teenage daughter who is in the make up stage, Wow she loves her three way mirror with lights you can modify depending on day -evening use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror as it has a nice bright lighting system which many of hte makeup mirrors today do not have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered and used these Jerdon make up mirrors for many years now....approx 25. One of my Jerdon mirrors gave out (it&#x27;s lighting feature) recently. I was so happy to find and purchase a new one on amazon. When it arrived. I couldn&#x27;t wait to take it out of the box and replace my old one. I was unfortunately so surprised to find the following to be way under par from what I&#x27;m accustomed to receiving by this companies product. 1.) on and off switch has changed-Flimsy, poor quality. 2.) the 5x magnify side of mirror has also become much cheaper quality. It&#x27;s wavy-like reflection is horrible. It&#x27;s like a carnival mirror where your face gets totally distorted. Not at all like before when it just did its thing and magnified! 3.) and the unit itself is so much lighter in weight (cheaper) that when you need to change light hue or press on/off switch. It slips away and off of my make up table. I now need to hold it in place in order to press any function to avoid this from happening. I used to just shut it off with an simple,  easy press of a finger. I can say more but that&#x27;s enough to get the message across and to say I&#x27;m very dissapointed and bummed out about this. I&#x27;ve been a huge fan, loyal and satisfied customer of this product in the past.... Sadly, Not anymore. I hope the company goes back to making it the quality product it used to be.</li>
    <li> I wanted a make-up mirror and knew I did not want dim lights, bulky/large casing, etc.  After reading the reviews I opted for the Jerdon. I really like the mirror and personally think the tri-fold is a nice touch. Some Jerdon reviews mentioned dim lighting.&lt;br /&gt;IF you diminish other lighting sources in the room (lamps, overhead light, etc.) the makeup mirror is very well lit.  I apply my makeup early in the morning, before sunrise, so natural light is not a problem.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love my lighted make-up mirror!  I haven&#x27;t had so many compliments on my appearance in a long time.  Now I&#x27;m getting them daily.  Sad to think what it might have been like for the viewer before!  Get it; you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I really struggled with whether to buy this or not after reading a lot of mixed reviews about this product working.  The only bad thing I can say is the magnified mirror part is distorted unless you get up close to it.  I have only turned this on twice since I bought it and honestly the only reason I got this was because I have always wanted a mirror like this since I was a little girl.  I really haven&#x27;t found a good place in my home to put it so I&#x27;ll use it often because my apartment is very small and space is limited and I don&#x27;t have a vanity area and my normal routine has always been to get ready in the bathroom but it&#x27;s nice to know I have this mirror in case I ever need it.  I love it, the colors are pretty and the nastalgia alone was reason enough for me to buy this mirror.  It makes me happy to own it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Returning it.</li>
    <li> This is my second mirrow.  I bought my first Jerdon lighted mirrow about 6 years ago....</li>
    <li> the magnifying mirror is so distorted I don&#x27;t look human. I had two others before this one and they just enlarged my face.  The mirror on this one looks like it really sinks in.  I threw the boxes out before I used it so I can&#x27;t send it back.Very displeased.</li>
    <li> This is actually Adam&#x27;s girlfriend.  I was disappointing with the lighting on this mirror.  I wanted something BRIGHT and I found that this wasn&#x27;t there.  The magnification mirror seemed to be a little &amp;#34;off,&amp;#34; like a fun-house mirror where the magnification was pretty different in the center than it was on the edges.  I chose to return and look for something a little bit better.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror I can put my makeup on and make sure I don&#x27;t put too much the only bad thing I have to say is I wish I could install the lights when they go out because this is my third time purchasing this type of mirror.</li>
    <li> Very bright lighting for putting on make up.  The only thing I dislike is the stand</li>
    <li> Great gift for my teenage daughter.  She would come into our room multiple times a day to use my wife&#x27;s very expensive lighted makeup mirror.  We decided enough already - get your own!  Of course, I don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars on my 16 year old, so I looked around and checked the reviews and decided this was perfect.  It comes packaged well and was extremely easy to set up. It looks nice and sits at the perfect height for her desk.  The center mirror swivels between regular and super magnified.  The side mirrors allow you to see difficult located spots on the sides of your face.  My daughter loves it.  Good value for a nice mirror.</li>
    <li> Very nice, light works good, use mostly the day light for putting on makeup, oh and I even caught my husband checking his face out.</li>
    <li> Works great and as described, my friends all want one, super value too!  (I&#x27;ve had it for over a year it is long lasting)</li>
    <li> It was better than I thought it would be and I love it</li>
    <li> Purchased the item yesterday, received it today.  Aside from the enthusiasm that my wife showed when she (unexpectedly) received this; the purchase was a bust.  The slider control that changes the lighting moved once to the left but then locked up and would not budge.  No matter how much force was applied (or not applied), the lights would not rotate.  The mirrors looked nice but the plastic nature of the unit made it feel like a Playskool toy.  I&#x27;m not just saying that to be mean, it literally brought back memories and reminded me of a toy as we tried to rotate the lights.  Sending this back and looking for a better quality mirror.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! I purchased this for my daughter in October and saved it for a Christmas present. My daughter used the mirror for less than two weeks and now the lights don&#x27;t work anymore. I can&#x27;t return the product because I purchased it in October (but it has been in a closet for months) per Amazon and I don&#x27;t have the box anymore. Amazon should not be selling this product because you are ripping off your customers and it is not a cheap product. What a poor Christmas gift for my daughter!</li>
    <li> The lighting is good for doing my makeup, it&#x27;s just like the one my grandmother had in the late 80&#x27;s early 90&#x27;s.  The most magnified side though is really hard to focus.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my eyes or my mirror but I only use one side of it.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my twin girls: they love the mirrors , works great : thank you.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a piece of junk because you cannot change the bulbs.  Save your money and purchase an inexpensive mirror for $20.00 or less.</li>
    <li> My daughter in-law loves it</li>
    <li> Stopped working after the first week. Already disposed of the packaging or else I would return.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for exact same model which quit working due to bulb failure after about 2 years. I found an article on the internet that told me how to replace the bulbs for about $15 so I did that and bought this one as a backup for my wife in case I&#x27;m not around to fix the old one again.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror for the price. Great for everything I need it for!</li>
    <li> I got this product and it was great! I had it for about a week and then one morning when I was getting ready it made a loud crackling noise and then quick working.</li>
    <li> I am on my third one. The other two had a bulb blowout after a week or two. Even though Amazon has been great with replacing them, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror as a gift from  my parents for Christmas.  Today would have been day 8 that I used it but it blew up.  Literally there was a loud pop and a burning smell and it went black.  Again, after 8 deays of use and it was plugged into a surge protector.  To be honest I didn&#x27;t like the mirror that much to begin with.  I was trying to get use to it after having my old one for so many years. (Which thank goodness I kept because it is back in service).  This mirror&#x27;s setting were very flimsy as on the daylight setting for instance, it was caught between daylight and the next setting giving off a pink glow, which made my face very pink and red.  The magnified side was so magnified it was like a fun house mirror in that it was very distorted unless you put your face right on it.  I will be trying to get the information to send mine back and get a refund for my parents and possibly a different brand. I do not recommend this mirror as overall I feel it was cheaply made and of course the blow up didn&#x27;t make my help me see it in a more favorable light.</li>
    <li> The mirror magnification isn&#x27;t enough for me (my fault for picking the wrong one) however the lights are WAY too dim and pretty much if you sneeze, you knock the swivel mirror out of position. I have to tape it down for it to stay in place. Between that and the fact that I still have to bring in a desk lamp to get enough light, I should&#x27;ve spent the extra money and gotten the more expensive model that a friend has (that I know works).</li>
    <li> This is great! Just like the one my mom had when I was growing up, with four different light settings and a magnification mirror. I liked the adjustable height ramp so I can tilt as needed. Nice and sturdy and brightly lit! And cheaper than buying at Bed Bath and Beyond or Walmart!</li>
    <li> Sorry to say that this mirror stop lighting up completely after just a little over one year.  At first the bulbs started flickering, and shortly thereafter the unit would not turn on at all.  My previous lighted makeup mirror lasted 34 years, I am not joking.  You can imagine my shock and disbelief at this one breaking so soon. I would never purchase any Jerdon brand product again because of their shoddy workmanship.  Be forewarned.</li>
    <li> My mother who just turned 100 said she didn&#x27;t want anything, didn&#x27;t need anything, and didn&#x27;t want anyone to buy her anything.  But then her 50 year old magnifying mirror broke and I bought this as a replacement.  This woman has lived through the century that saw the emergence of the telephone and the motorcar, spaceships to outerspace and then the internet.  She still lives on her own and Skypes with me on her laptop!  She was actually amazed by this lighted magnifying mirror with 4 different light colors, folding doors so it would take less space on her makeup table (yes she still gets dressed up and puts on \\&quot;her face\\&quot; every day) so this was a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, though she was excited to receive this mirror it didn&#x27;t work.  The light doesn&#x27;t really illuminate the face.  The mirror is of poor quality and very inaccurate.  The stand doesn&#x27;t stay standing up.  If my mother had not been embarrassed to tell me that it didn&#x27;t work I would have returned it for her but she didn&#x27;t tell me until months later when it was too late.</li>
    <li> love this mirror so far!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, and so handy with the tri-fold mirrors.  Also, outlet is great for convenience.  I bought and gave away two mirrors as soon as I found this one.</li>
    <li> I had used a Revlon lighted mirror for years (several, actually).  Loved them.  I primarily use the magnifying mirror, as it is imperative for fine work like tweezing eyebrows or putting on eye liner.  This magnifying mirror is horrible!  It is really like a fun house mirror and is actually concave and thus distorts your image unless you move way up close.  I have had many magnifying mirrors over the years and NONE have been concave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the &amp;#34;wing mirrors&amp;#34; unnecessary and actually get in the way of reaching for my makeup brushes, etc. on the vanity.  I am considering seeing if I can remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lighting is fine.  I always use the brightest light to apply makeup and the daylight option is fine for that.  I do like that the lights are not multiple round bulbs, but are the tubes, which give better light.  But the horrible magnifying mirror dictates the three star rating.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror.  It helps putting on make in different &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; situations very helpful.  It is also great for someone with eyesight problems when it comes to shaping eyebrows and other closeup areas.</li>
    <li> I feel like this is a good mirror, but I thought it would be a bit more solid than it is. It definitely has that plastic feel to it. Holding up well so far. Ask me in a year.</li>
    <li> I returned this, it was the wrong one, my fault not Amazon.  I just ordered the wrong one for a gift.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get it to switch to a different light setting but otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> The Mirror Side that is 5x is not clear.  You look blurring when looking into it.  I did not like it.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my daughter and she loves it .</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE LIGHT BULBS IN THIS UNIT BECAUSE IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE OPENED.  ALSO THE MAGNIFICATION IS DISTORTED.  I REGRET BUYING THIS SO VERY MUCH.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m speaking on behalf my girlfriend because I bought this as a birthday gift for her.  She has wanted a lighted mirror forever. Actually, she&#x27;d rather have a lighted vanity if she could.  But for my price range, this is what I bought based on customer reviews.  She&#x27;s very much into her make-up, and doing tutorials on youtube.  So she definitely needed something of a professional grade.  She&#x27;s used it every day since her birthday, and loves it.  The only complaint she has had is that the stand could be better.  The backing can be a bit flimsy. Other than that, this was a great buy.</li>
    <li> I like the mirror although the 5X side is so powerful it&#x27;s kind of scary. I don&#x27;t use the lights because the colors of the lights are poor and for sure not very flattering and I have enought light where I use the mirror.</li>
    <li> This was a very disappointing product. I was moved to buy it because of the overwhelming amount of positive reviews. Costumer reviews hardly ever lead me astray but they did this time. The mirror is very small, too small really to say that you can use the mirrored flaps.  The different light settings are indeed different but they are so dull they didn&#x27;t really help me to see my face better (and I&#x27;m 27, I don&#x27;t have a vision problem, I don&#x27;t even wear glasses). The workmanship is also very poor, it feels like a little girl toy. Other people have mentioned that it takes a while for the light to warm up and turn on, it&#x27;s true but that would&#x27;ve been nothing if not for all the other things that are wrong with it. Unfortunately I had ordered it already when I ran into it at Bed Bath and Beyond, I sent it back without opening it. Go check it out in person before you order. I&#x27;m going with a Rialto instead.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Like that I can close the mirrors and must have the electric outlet on front.</li>
    <li> Love love love it the lights are just bright enough and the mirrors are adjustable with raise bar on back.  It has an outlet in the front that I used blow dryer and other styling tools with it works great.</li>
    <li> I GOT IT AND THIE LIGHTS WORKED ONCE THEN NEVER AGAIN I EMAILD THE COMPANY 3 TIMES AND NEVER HEARD FORM THEM. IT IS GETTING POWER BECAUSE MY IRON WORKS THAT I CAN PLUG RIGHT INTO THE MIRROR</li>
    <li> I like it !but I do hope have bigger size!!</li>
    <li> I could not find bulbs to fix my other mirror and thought I would try this brand.  Not to pleased.</li>
    <li> My bedroom has many light sources all of which are low light producing. This has been a issue for my wife for many years when its time for her to get into make-up mode. This product has silenced the cry&#x27;s \\&quot;I cant see anything\\&quot; along with some possible choice words. Althow it has not been an official complaint I do believe the total light output should be a little bit more powerful. All in all no regrets with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The lights stopped working after just two months. No drops, no accidents. In fact this unit has not been moved off the vanity at all and has been treated with care. Yesterday the lights just blinked off and won&#x27;t come back on. My prior Jerdon was purchased at a yard sale and lasted five more years. Obviously this version is manufactured with less quality control.</li>
    <li> This mirror was good for about 6 months but then it just went out.  First the bulb would flicker for a while and then it went out completely.  When it worked it was really nice. But now I am without a mirror again and I&#x27;m skeptical about buying a new one.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly as expected.  It arrived promptly.  I have no negatives for this merchant or item.  Will need more in the future.  Will consider ordering again.</li>
    <li> One day my wife was complaining that she could not find a decent makeup lighted mirror.  She said she had one back in the 80&#x27;s that was excellent.  I googled to find one and this came up.  We bought it and she loves it. Adjustable light settings and dimming.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror in February 2012. On 12/27 the bulbs quit working. I called Jerdon and faxed copy of Amazon invoice to them, and today I received a new mirror! You might say the bulbs should have lasted longer, but the warranty was &amp;#34;No questions asked&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I just ordered this and this is awesome products to those who loved taking videos and can&#x27;t afford the best lightning this is for us guys..</li>
    <li> It is as I had expectted with my eyes failing as the years go by.</li>
    <li> Love my mirror. It&#x27;s just like the ones I had when I was growing up. The magnification is perfect! It looks good on my vanity top.</li>
    <li> As always Jerdon comes to the rescue.  My husband kept promising new bulbs for the old mirror, I ordered a new mirror. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love it! Years ago I had a mirror similar to this,and used it all the time. I like the different lightings, and the flexable three way mirrors</li>
    <li> Meets all of my expectations. I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for a few months now, without issue. I really only use the &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; setting.</li>
    <li> Good deal, arrived quickly, lights could be brighter, but my daughter loves the adjustment feature and it fits easily anywhere.</li>
    <li> I used to own Conair mirror ([[ASIN:B000U0F9GA Conair BE47BR Double Sided Illuminated Mirror]] which accidentally got broken. I did not want to buy the same one because of the poorly designed switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerdon mirror is good if you do not use magnified glass too much. It is not oval like many mirrors, so on the corners it looks very disorienting, which affects your vision if you don&#x27;t look straight into the center of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did love the lighting. The switch changes the color of the light from \\&quot;Day\\&quot; to \\&quot;Evening\\&quot; lighting, which is great to apply make-up for different occasions. The switch is excellent and easy to use. I did not yet experience the bulb burnout like many other reviewers did, but I will update this review as soon as it happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I decided to keep the mirror because of the lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have never used/looked into the side mirrors yet!</li>
    <li> Not magnified enough.  Also has crazy colors which are supposed to match various interiors like the office, home, outside but they all seemed weird.</li>
    <li> I used to have a problem with my eye mascara and I would have it all over my eyes.  Now all I have to do is light it up and use the&lt;br /&gt;side that makes everything look bigger and it&#x27;s perfect.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> As I am getting older putting on make up is getting harder to tell if I put too much on or not enough.  I have been looking for a good lighted mirror with a magnified mirror as well.  This lighted mirror makes me feel confident that my makeup is applied appropriately especially with the different light settings that I can see how it looks it different light settings.  Also the price was very good considering the cost at local department stores.</li>
    <li> I gave it a chance for three weeks and the on/off switch failed.  I have another Remington that is still working and I just wanted another mirror for a second bathroom.  I can&#x27;t find anything new that compares to the old Remington so I bought another one off E-Bay.  Now I have to figure out how the warranty works.</li>
    <li> I never got a chance to try this out since the sliding filters to change the amount of light weren&#x27;t working. Returned</li>
    <li> I have never had a make-up mirror before but bathroom space is frequently limited due to both of us getting ready at the same time.  I use the mirror at my desk so the bathroom can be used by others.  It is a perfect size, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the lights at all.  It is light and stores easily.  It may be slightly fragile so you have to be careful with the stand at the back.  I find that the magnifying mirror helps a lot, again, never thought I would want to see myself magnified, but I feel better about the make-up job.  The lights for different environments, office, day, evening, home, help as well.</li>
    <li> Really cool setting, amazing quality mirrors ! I really love it lots, the price is fantastic and it does the job :)</li>
    <li> Years ago, I had a mirror similar to this and loved it.  I was looking for one for my daughter for her vanity and found this one.  I had read previous reviews regarding the lights not being bright enough and/or not working properly...then I read reviews that said they were super bright and worked fine.  I decided to give it a shot.  It&#x27;s perfect!  It&#x27;s VERY bright and we have had no problems with the lights at all.  My daughter loves this mirror!  The magnified side doesn&#x27;t distort like some mirrors can and the side mirrors are helpful to her if she needs to use them.  The back stand is adjustable and the front plug is convenient.</li>
    <li> Love the different settings, 3 mirrors and easy positioning....good mirror and happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Was not pleased with the lighting.  Difficult to see.</li>
    <li> I like the mirror but don&#x27;t like the concave way the magnified side is made.  Image is somewhat distorted.</li>
    <li> I purchased this &amp; only used it a few times before it stopped working. I would not recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my grandaughter. I was comparing prices all over and this is the best deal. I will be sure to tell her to hold the button down until the light comes on. Mirror looks sturdy and heavy. I bet this will last her many years..or until she gets older and decides she doesn&#x27; t need so much makeup.</li>
    <li> This mirror really works! I can see clearly everything I need to in order to put on makeup; I like the variety of light options--daylight, nighttime, etc. I also like the added side mirrors for better light and no shadowing.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this as seems nice and bright as my other one didn&#x27;t meet this quality would recommend it.</li>
    <li> girlfriend likes it.  the lights provide a realistic look for what the make up will look like after applying.  scoop</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement mirror for my old Conair mirror which stopped working. This mirror is bright and works almost as good as the old style light up make-up mirrors to which I&#x27;m accustomed. If you are seeking something with adequate lighting and a good close-up, this is your mirror! My vision is poor, and I need lighting to enable me to see well, and this mirror fits the bill. You&#x27;ll like it. Trust me! :)</li>
    <li> The florescent lamps shine directly into the users eyes.  Even with the colored filters, my wife was too sensitive to the glare.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a well made product and a good value if the light works for you.  We sent ours back for a Conair that will take standard incandescent bulbs (night light size) that we use in place of the colored original ones.</li>
    <li> this was for my daughter because her old one broke and we couldn&#x27;t find one the same as her old one, you guys always come thru.</li>
    <li> These little make up mirrors just never have enough light. I thought this one might but it doesn&#x27;t and the different light settings are a joke. Had to send it back.</li>
    <li> The magnification was a bit distorted. I couldn&#x27;t see in it very well compared to the revlon brand that I used before this one.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s college dorm room.</li>
    <li> Two weeks after using it the bulb started to flicker so Im guessing the bulb is going bad already.</li>
    <li> Takes forever for lights to light up. Takes several attempts to depress button over and over again. If you are lucky they will light up. Now no longer lights up I will hold button down both lights will illuminate for a second or two. Then when I let go of button no light at all. I have had other makeup mirrors in past and never had this problem with any of them. There is no way to easily change out lights. Going to buy a different brand now.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this mirror, I thought it was great. The lighting and magnification met my needs perfectly. I had no issues with this mirror until about 3 months later, the bulbs went out. At first I thought its no big deal, I&#x27;ll just replace the bulbs. Then I realized, it&#x27;s impossible to get to the bulbs without taking the mirror apart. Once I could get to the bulb, I realized there&#x27;s no way to get it out without breaking the mirror. So I ended up throwing the whole mirror in the trash.</li>
    <li> After one week my wife turn this on and it actually caught fire I&#x27;m talking about it actually flamed up from one of the lights not only would I never buy this item again but I&#x27;m wondering about the whole online service if know when test these things how can we buy them</li>
    <li> Great product and I could not find it anywhere else . Glad I purchased and will do so again . Thanks</li>
    <li> I gave as a gift and my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Both lights blew out at the same time 3 weeks after purchasing it.  Product is made with no serviceable parts, so don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> i read the reviews.  this was a 50-50 decision.  i bought it for my daughter who is now entering the world of makeup.  i should have listened to the other 50%.  it is OK as magnification goes, and both of my girls used one....but as some other reviews indicated, the bulb will stop working for no reason.  now i had an electrical license at one time and was engaged in the trade, but i should not have to take apart a mirror to get access to the fluorescent tubes, solder, clip, etc - to a mirror that was less than 2 months old!  return it?  ha!  was outside the window.  will i replace it?  i don&#x27;t know.  $40 every other month for a mirror with a light would add up</li>
    <li> This was for my Granddaughters 12 th Birthday. She loves it now that she has her first make up kit. Growing up too fast. A+++seller</li>
    <li> Loved it for 2 years. Best light ever. But it is disposable. SAD :(&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is great. Like the outlet for the blow dryer in the front.&lt;br /&gt;Just did not last long enough to suit me.</li>
    <li> In theory this is a great product, however the only part of the mirror that magnifiyes and moves is the small center part.  The stand is somewhat limited and you have to have it on the right stand to be able to use the mirror.  It&#x27;s sad to me that they can&#x27;t make the product as they advertise the product to be.[[ASIN:B0000AFUT3 Jerdon Classic JGL9W Lighted Tri-fold Mirror, 5x Magnification]]</li>
    <li> Product good and will buy again.  Will buy another again if necessary.  Came right on time.  No problems with the product</li>
    <li> I bought 2 for a couple teen girls. They love it and that&#x27;s all that mattered to me. Great gift for the price</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. The lighting choices fit my needs and the magnifying mirror helps me put on makeup without my glasses which is super helpful. One reviewer mentioned the magnifier is a little distorted, but you just move closer or further to narrow into the desired area. It is not a full face mirror, but a detail mirror. This is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> We like it. It&#x27;s easy for us to set up a makeup station in a hotel room, but it is not that bright.</li>
    <li> love this mirror.  I leave very early for the office - especially in winter it&#x27;s so dark.  The lighting is perfect</li>
    <li> I love this make-up mirror.  My bedroom is a little on the dark side and this lights up the area very well.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for light and the 5x is great to have.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of light choices for doing make up and checking it before leaving home.  Does require a lot of space and nearby electrical plug.</li>
    <li> I really like this lighted make up mirror.  I have trouble putting on my eyeliner without my glasses, and I can see good with the magnified section of the mirror.  It folds up for easy packing for travel.</li>
    <li> Decent, I was expecting better quality.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and a week later the light stopped working. Too late to return it because i did my Christmas shopping early.  Piece of crap!</li>
    <li> Brightness of lights-excellent, mirror quality-excellent, amount of mirrors-excellent... Takes up space-YES!, sturdy-NOT VERY. The main reason why I recommend you DO NOT buy this product is because the lights inside the mirror are old fashioned. Meaning you have to plug the mirror in and turn the ON button on for the lights to heat up for about 10-20 minutes. Even then, it takes a skill that I have mastered (after months of having this thing) to click the ON and OFF button in a sort of &amp;#34;rhythm&amp;#34; to make the lights turn on. I usually get it after 10-12 frustrating tries...</li>
    <li> Bought several of these mirrors for Christmas gifts.  All the girls have been real happy with their own makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mirror. I use it to apply makeup and to groom my brows. I love how adjustable it is. You can change the brightness/color of the lights and the angle of the mirror. It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The mirror was fine, large enough, the magnifying side was okay.  The light settings were fine.  It did its job.  Unfortunately within one year of purchase, the lights stopped working completely making the mirror completely useless to me.  Upon further inspection of the mirror, my husband and I realized there is no way to replace the lightbulbs which seems ridiculous.  After using about 10-15 minutes a day most days of one year, it is junk.  I will replace it with a more well known brand name and hope that their lightbulbs can be replaced.</li>
    <li> Not tall enough. But I just put it on top of the box.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is very nice.</li>
    <li> This is a Jerdon Tri-Fold Mirror Model JGL9W.  It will not light up!  Many others are complaining of this I should have listened.  BUYER BEWARE!!  There is no on button to hold in as some customers mention.  This is the newer model with a simple on/off switch not a Push-and-Hold type switch lIKE older style fluorescent lights use to come with.  DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror after buying one at a local drug store that turned out to be very poorly made. This mirror was quite the opposite. It is sturdy. Some complained that it was not bright enough, however, my wife says it is plenty bright. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to replace a similar make up mirror to replace a well worn out one. Very happy with it and like it just as much as the old one.</li>
    <li> I was struggling to put makeup on at a bathroom counter with a big mirror.  Finally broke down and got this mirror.  Now I sit at a small desk with this lighted mirror and it is just perfect.  Love having all the different light colors too, and it&#x27;s nice to have the magnified mirror right there as well.  Great little unit!</li>
    <li> This mirror is amazing. Now I don&#x27;t have to be to close to a mirror to put makeup on. The lights work so far. No complaints on that. There are different settings for the light depending where you are at. I love my mirror</li>
    <li> I had this same mirror for about 13 years.  Never had to change the bubls.  Worked great.  I only bought a new one because the old one started taking so long to turn on and had become very yellow from years of sunlight hitting it from my window.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these mirrors for my daughters, and they are both very happy with them. I haven&#x27;t seen one of these in at least 20 years, and they do work, very well.  This make up mirror is very bright.  They also like the additional outlet for hair accessories, or music. They were also impressed with magnification mirror.  I read other reviews before purchasing, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with bulbs from either of these mirrors. They work just fine. Very satisfies with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This could be a very good lighted mirror, in terms of quality, but I stopped using it pretty quickly because of the positioning of the lights, so I can&#x27;t say if it is. The lights are located too close together, so they shine into my eyes, making it very difficult to see my reflection. This may be fine for doing very close makeup work, but not for anything of any distance, such as styling hair. I don&#x27;t particulaly like the different color filters for the lights, and I&#x27;m just not sure if any accurately duplicate the lighting situations they intend to. The &amp;#34;kickstand&amp;#34; in the back is pretty long, so you can&#x27;t move the mirror back very far before it hits the wall. A wall-mounting feature might have been nice. When the mirror angle is positioned at its most vertical, it isn&#x27;t balanced and tends to make the mirror unstable. The magnifying mirror on the flip side is pretty strong, and good if you want to see every pore on your face. Since the lighting doesn&#x27;t really work for me, I have to give this item to someone else.</li>
    <li> This is the third mirror of this type that I have ordered. I use it everyday to apply my makeup and would be lost without it. I find that the bulbs last about one year - unfortunately. There is nothing that can be opened to replace the bulbs, and to get it done by someone would not be worth the cost. Therefore, I have to invest in a new one as soon as the bulbs go. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my new bathroom vanity.  Lighting is a little strange and I wasn&#x27;t happy so I gave it to my daughter and she likes it!</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror, but I wish I would have ordered the 10X because my eyesight is that bad.</li>
    <li> Lights stopped working in a short period of time</li>
    <li> The lights are not as bright is I hoped. It isn&#x27;t hot. My eyes must be going because the 5x magnification isn&#x27;t enough for me to get all of the pesky hairs!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mirror!!  It is just the right size!  The magnifying side makes makeup application a breeze!</li>
    <li> Light is horrible. It wobbles and the mirrors are tiny! It has been returned.</li>
    <li> my mother was looking for a replacement for her old clairol mirror.she is very happy with this!</li>
    <li> Great replacement for old makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> great mirror my daughter loves it</li>
    <li> Great lights! My makeup now looks almost pro due to having better lighting!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my old set up that was 20 years old and much hated by my daughters.  Yes, had it for 20 years and it was still working well but the sides came off during a recent move.  This is the same basic design and the light can be bright or dim.  I like having a close up and normal mirror of this size and am not a fan of the smaller round ones that you can find everywhere ver inexpensively.  This is well worth what I paid for it as it is just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> She loves it and uses it every day.  Just another tool in her feel good about how she looks box.  I&#x27;m glad it works so well for her.  We&#x27;ve had it for months now and she still thanks me for this unexpected little gift.  I&#x27;m sure my wife would recommend this light to any woman.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday, and have it set up in at my dresser, rather than in my bathroom.  This lets me do my cosmetics application with having to stand in a steamy bathroom.  The lighting isn&#x27;t perfect, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a x-mas present for my daughter.  Came just as described and much cheaper than I found in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Love the plug in the front for blow dryer or curling iron but lights could be a little better when it comes to color....nice adjustable mirror for your vanity!</li>
    <li> I bought this Jerdon makeup mirror for my mother after her other mirror light finally burned out. I discovered that replacing the lights isn&#x27;t quite as easy as I thought. She had a Jerdon before the last one and it lasted for a long time. We were so pleased with the quality and light from this Jerdon! The mirror expanse with the three sides is superior to many others I looked at. The adjustable light sources will help you avoid a makeup application that just won&#x27;t work in, say, an office environment. The magnification side turns easily and is very clear. And the price is very good for such a quality product. I&#x27;m not sure why the negative reviews are on here because my mom is very happy with it and she uses it every day.</li>
    <li> love love love this mirror, shipped fast, i&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I can put my makeup on great with this mirror.</li>
    <li> The 5X magnification on this mirror is not clear.  It looks like mirrors in a Fun House that disfigures the image. Disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Should have given this a ZERO (0) Star.  After about three months there is another problem.  The right light does not light up.  Now I still Need a mirror and have to find money to get some other.  I will never buy anything with the name Jerdon again.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very nice...I like the different light settings and it has made applying makeup much easier and more fun.</li>
    <li> My son suggested a new makeup mirror for my daughter-in-law.  This one turned out to be perfect.  The front outlet is great!</li>
    <li> The Jerdon makeup mirror far exceeded my expectations. I have had two  similar mirrors which I thought were great. But the Jerdon mirror is a lot brighter and the side mirrors seem to me a little magnified which I really like. I am thinking of buying one just like it for my grandaughter.</li>
    <li> If you look at the back of this mirror, you will see the metal stand....that holds the mirror up,... is held onto the back by 2 pieces of plastic. If you leave your mirror in the upright position all the time, this does not create a problem. I, however, need to fold the mirror and put it away when not in use.The plastic that holds the stand part on breaks very quickly, making the mirror useless. We have tried taping, hot gluing, and epoxying brackets onto the back of the mirror to hold the stand on, but nothing sticks to the plastic for long. If you leave the mirror in place, a nice mirror. If you need to move it or put it away after use, then this is not the best mirror for you.</li>
    <li> Love using this trifold, magnified mirror specially when putting on eyeshadow and reshaping  brows. The different level of lighting works!</li>
    <li> THE UNIT IS COMPACT AND WORKS WELL. IT IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND OF COURSE THE NPRICE WAS RIGHT.</li>
    <li> Nice light and magnification!  I replaced an old  Conaire with this and I really like it!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 mirrors, one for each of my teenage daughters.  They both love them and so do I.  I will be ordering another one for myself and one for my sister.  There have been no issues with the light needing to warm up.  These are fantastic for make-up, eyebrow shaping, and for bedroom use instead of messy counters in the bathroom.  It is true that this is the mirror that gives you true lighting and magnification yet makes you look like a model instead of the mirrors that cause you to feel bad about yourself.  I am so glad I ordered this on Amazon and did not just pick up one at the store because I would have been disappointed.  Fast delivery and one of my daughters favorite Christmas presents.  It has also saved me money on professional facial waxing because I can see so perfectly.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it to death. We also found a power socket on there so she can plug in her curler!</li>
    <li> Nice large mirrors. Variety of light choices with just the right magnification.Great price! I would recommend this for the price!</li>
    <li> this mirror is what the seller said it is, but it is too small for my purposes. My hair is long and I wanted a mirror to do my hair in. This mirror is good for makeup application but not for doing long hair.</li>
    <li> I was given a mirror such as this from a friend who had since she was a teenager. when she gave it to me she was 48 and I&#x27;ve had for about 10 years after. Then it finally retired. So I bout this new one just like it. It only lasted six months. first the mirror failed then the plug attached to the mirror failed. Things these day are not made to last. Won;t buy another again.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend who loves to try out different types of makeup, she totally loved it</li>
    <li> only had this mirror for about 2 weeks but so far i LOVE IT. i showed it to my husband and he was amazed at all the functions it has. the magnifying mirror is AWESOME. i need to post a pic of my eyebrows so you can see LOL. when i set this up i sat at this mirror doing my eyebrows for probably 30 mins. i do my makeup using this every day. i didnt have trouble turning on the lights like some other reviewers.. it says in the instructions that you have to hold down the ON button instead of just pressing it. the different colors of lights are awesome too. my fave so far is the DAYTIME one. i LOOOOOOOVE how the side mirrors swivel. you can see your whole face that way. it feels like very good quality, not cheap at all. the main reason i got this one as opposed to a conair was you can plug things into it. i have used a curling iron and a flat iron and it works just fine. i will update once i&#x27;ve had this for a little bit longer but so far its great</li>
    <li> Great mirror at a good price. Makes applying makeup so much easier.  Love the side mirrors and it is great for traveling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok..........Jerdon Classic JGL9W Lighted Tri-fold Mirror, 5x Magnification my other one cost 50-60 and so worth it....lights are pretty dim</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend. She was greatly disappointed. The different settings on the light ( which is not very bright) is actually a piece of plastic that slides over the bulb to change the hue.  I would not suggest buying this. I will be buying a better one as soon as possible. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> One of the best makeup mirrors I have ever owned. Absolutely love it.  The 5x mag is outstanding. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had a mirror like this for years and the lights burned out. This one is better than the last one. I couldn&#x27;t get ready in the morning without it.</li>
    <li> Defective and Shorted Out Soon After Return Period Ended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to that point, it was a good enough product. Must give zero stars.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this mirror--it has good lighting is lightweight and was reasonably priced --BUT--the second time I tried to use it it flashed once and died.  I bought it for travel so was really bummed that it only worked once and died</li>
    <li> Love this makeup mirror.  I can take it with me also.  It is nice and bright.  If in a plane would take on the plane with me. Lights went out after about 9 months.  Never thought about warranty.  So when I did we tried to take out light bulbs. It has to be sent in.  And you pay postage and for the new bulbs.  I liked it while it worked.  But the price you send it back for you  just as well get a different one where you can change bulbs.  Disappointed in  the quality.</li>
    <li> These are such a great buy and so durable.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror in February 2011, and as of 8/25/12, the mirror no longer works.  It is not the bulbs, but it is probably the capacitor.  It would cost just as much to replace the part as if would to just buy another mirror.  Wow, they have this one year warranty figured out.  Like Tommy Boy said, it is a guarenteed piece of crap in a box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror since Oct. 2010 and it was great till last week when the bulbs went out and there is apparently no way to replace them. If you don&#x27;t mind having to replace this item in about 2 years or so then I&#x27;d say go for it. As for me I&#x27;ll be looking for another similar item that I won&#x27;t have to trash in such a short time span. What a waste!</li>
    <li> Bought the Jerdon Classic JGL9W Lighted Tri-fold Mirror for my daughter for Christmas 2010. It worked well for about a year, and has been spotty since early spring 2012. Now the lights only come on sporadically, and only if you spin the mirror, jump up and down, clap your hands and pray. Then, if we&#x27;re lucky, the lights MIGHT grace us with their so-called presence. It&#x27;s so pathetic that Amazon knows that half of these mirrors are defective (I mean, have they actually READ the reviews???) and yet they still sell them. If they wanted to make some money, they could make the lights replaceable and sell the bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, my Amazon warranty was only good for 30 days, and the Jerdon warranty for 1 year, so I&#x27;m SOL. Fun stuff.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews prior to purchasing this mirror without caring too much for its lighting or  its cheap plastic feel .  I needed a tri-fold mirror to trim my side burns all around my ear and possibly back back of my head. I used this mirror so far for 4 days and I will rate it a  1-5 star rating based on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look and Feel  2 stars&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is bulky feels cheaply made as I expected it to be for the price I paid $29.97. It has a built in cord that you CAN&#x27;T wrap around it or hide when not in use. You will probably want to hide this mirror when not in use as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirror Angel options  2 stars&lt;br /&gt;The Middle mirror is actually 2 in 1 mirror if you spin it around.  The front side has regular mirror and as you spin it vertically, the back part has  X5 magnification mirror.  The side mirrors, unfortunately are not big enough to cover a full view of your entire face. The reason for this is because they are too close to each other. The whole entire mirror has a tilt lever that allows it to tilt back. The tilt level is not that great because it has a flat long plastic lever that dangles flat like a Popsicle stick when the mirror is not being tilted. The mirror also wobbles on an uneven surface when it is fully erected because there is nothing that will balance support it when it stands straight (Picture it as a hard cover book standing vertically.) It can easily be knocked down with the slightest push. This also knocked the review from 3 stars to 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light bulbs and lighting  3 stars&lt;br /&gt;It has  four lighting effects  DAY-OFFICE-EVENING-HOME. They change color as you slide to the desired location  It is not a dimmer as I thought it would be. Its actually just a slightly tinted color panel that that slides over the light bulbs to give it a color lighting effect.The bulbs are permanent so you can&#x27;t replace them once they burn out. I have only been using this mirror for 4 days so I don&#x27;t know how long the bulbs will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its not a horrible mirror if want a hands free way to trim the side of your head with side trimmer or hair clipper.  By hands free I mean, you don&#x27;t have to hold a hand-held mirror with one hand to see one side of your face and since you need two hands to trim your sides, one hand to fold the ear down and the other to follow the trim path, a tri-fold mirror  like this comes in handy but don&#x27;t expect anything extra cool features other that the light bulbs and middle-back  magnification mirror. It is up to you, the consumer, if $30 is all worth buying it./&gt;Overall its not a horrible mirror if want a hands free way to trim the side of your head with side trimmer or hair clipper.

    <li> Very disappointed. From the first time it was used, the slider was stiff and hard to move. Now it&#x27;s just stuck. Totally defeats the purpose of having multiple lighting options.</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas present for my wife and she loves it!!!  Exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 20 year old mirror that finally died.  What was important to me was having a 3 way mirror with a plug in the front.  This one is nice, looks good and works well.  The only thing I&#x27;m still struggling with is how stiff the hinges are on the 2 side mirrors.  I even put WD-40 on them and they are still stiff.  Everything else is great.</li>
    <li> I used to have a similar mirror to this by a different maker that lasted decades.  Then I tried this Jerdon model and liked the lighting and magnified mirror even better, but after 2 short years, the bulbs will no longer light.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the bulbs, but rather the ballast.  You can&#x27;t get parts for it, though, so now it&#x27;s going to Starvation Army or someplace like that.  Fortunately, there are a couple of similar mirrors on the market by other makers.  I&#x27;ll try one of those next.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy a Jerdon again unless it were the only lighted vanity mirror of this style.  Even then, I&#x27;d think hard about it.  Other reviewers didn&#x27;t get even 1 year before the lights went dark, so it seems to be a real crapshoot.  Two years might be the max, and that only if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got to go check out that Conair version now.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the mirror.  It gives off a good light and is easy to use.  It is not as tall as the former mirror that I had, but I do like the side mirrors.  It is difficult to find make up mirrors in stores.  I like to look at the merchandise prior to buying it .  I was pleased with the tri-fold mirror that I purchased and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Nice, but not bright enough</li>
    <li> Love it!  I had one like it many many years ago.  When it broke I bought a cheap one.  A mistake.  Now I have what I wanted all along.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the stainless steel one I had for years, but it&#x27;s certainly right up there at the top as far as makeup mirrors go.</li>
    <li> Well, I had my old Clairol lighted mirror forever.... no, really, through two daughters and their growing up years, and even to their daughters using it!  It finally bit the dust, so to speak.  Saw this one, read the description, and thought, Eureka!  This will help me see my wrinkled skin so much better so that I can figure out how to slap on enough makeup to allow me to go out in public without embarrassing anyone who is with me.  Yesterday, I looked at the lights on each side of the mirror (the day lights).  I realized that one side was Day and the other side was between the Day and the Office lights.  No wonder I looked lopsided when I went out.  Suddenly, there were sparks and a bzzzzzz noise and the smell of hot wire.  No, seriously.  The whole thing shorted out.  I really can&#x27;t recommend this as it posed a fire risk.  The idea was good, but, I have had it less than two months and this happened.  Back to the drawing board....</li>
    <li> the mirror is a good set up. I would give it a 5 star except it stopped working less than a month after purchase. I returned and will try another.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! Has multiple settings to adjust the lighting and different magnifications on either side of the middle mirror and on the sides. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> 30 days after purchase, it doesn&#x27;t light up anymore!</li>
    <li> Love the light. Makes putting make up on so much easier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend who laughed immediately after opening the package. It&#x27;s megalithic size is comparable to a mini fridge. It seems like the size is massive to make up for the terrible construction. The depth is about 3 Macbook Pros stacked! Brightness of the light is not bright at all, and quite dim actually. In a room with poor lighting, you will need a table lamp on next to this beast. You will also need reading glasses because the magnification is only 5x, so tweezing small, fine hairs will be arduous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the light setting switch repeatedly got stuck, it was time for it to go back. Don&#x27;t buy unless you need it as a set piece for your 80&#x27;s movie.</li>
    <li> Use this kind of lighted makeup mirror for the first time. Now I can see every pore so clearly. Obviously, it&#x27;s easier to see something I don&#x27;t want to see. Not its fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This giant mirror occupies a big part of space on my tiny vanity table, so I have to re-organize the layout of skin care and make-up products so that I can still easily access to these product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day light mode is too bright to me, making me uncomfortable as the light directly comes into eyes, unlike normal table lamp or floor lamps. Office light mode is quite odd with the blue light. Home mode is warm white or yellow. Evening mode is acceptable. Just owned it for half an hour - maybe things will change during night time. Hopefully the bulbs can last long. It&#x27;ll be impossible for me figure out how to change them-looks very complex from other reviews.</li>
    <li> I loved it when I got it. The next day the lights would not come on.so I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I love my mirror. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase of this same mirror. The first one, the bulbs wore out after about 3 years. The second one I purchased in June, 2014. There is something wrong the wiring that started about 2 weeks ago. If I wiggle the cord, eventually it will turn on. Not happy and cannot return it!</li>
    <li> This a great makeup mirror. I like that it has an extra outlet in front for your dryer or straightener (or whatever item you choose to use.) It&#x27;s got 4 different lighting options, though I tend to stick to day or evening. It&#x27;s a nice mirror for the cost.</li>
    <li> I have used one similar to this for the past at least 15 years and loved it. The on/off switch was finally going out so had to get a new one. I ordered this Jerdon model and it does the job. It is made out of flimsy plastic compared to my old, solid, heavy-duty plastic one. It feels a little fragile when moving it but it is doing the job just fine. I can&#x27;t say I love it, but I do like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Great product.</li>
    <li> After a month of owning this item it had stopped working, the lights went out. I only used it about 3 times totaling about 20mins of the lights being on. since it has been a month I cannot return the item, all I can do is accrue ANOTHER cost and buy replacement bulbs.  Very unhappy with this item.</li>
    <li> Like the side mirrors, but I need more magnification.  Would like to see it with 8x.  I don&#x27;t have four more words.</li>
    <li> Totally defective. I bought this product a month and a half ago, so I&#x27;m no longer eligible to return it.  I probably got half a dozen uses out of it before the area where you change the light settings had a spark/burst of light and both the bulbs blew.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to put your makeup on, on a dark winterery morning and once it&#x27;s clear it looks as perfect as if it was applied in good daylight, no need to pull out a tissue to tone down the blusher.  I&#x27;m from Northern Ireland and I purchased a Stepdown Converter for £6 something from ebay and mirror lights up perfectly.  Although the mirror looks abit like something from sixties or seventies, but thats not important- when you invest in good makeup its nice to apply it well, especially when there&#x27;s a lack of light.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER LIKES THIS MIRROR A LOT..SHE REALLY LIKES THE THREE MIRRORS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT ANGLES. ALSO THE DIFFERENT LIGHT BRIGHTNESS IS A BIG PLUS.</li>
    <li> This is my third one.  I keep one for home and one in my suitcase for when I travel.  I can&#x27;t put on my make-up without it!</li>
    <li> This lighted mirror solved the problem of minimal lighting for make-up application in the bathroom.  Multiple options for choosing level and type of light desired and the side mirror panels give great coverage of all angles. Light switch gives instant light with no flickering.  Only negative for me is the stand/angle mechanism.  I move my mirror around on the vanity, and the stand is awkward to get positioned when I am in a hurry.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement. She likes it. I had read some negative reviews, but there are always a couple of negative reviews by negative people who have unrealistic expectations, or fail to follow instructions. It has served her well for the last 2 years.</li>
    <li> Had this exact same mirror for many years.  I loved that it closed and had the power outlet on the front.  The lights finally died.  Since they cannot be replaced, I ordered the exact same thing.  When it arrived I found the 5X magnification side looked like a fun-house mirror.  Very distorted.  I pulled the old one out of the trash to make sure I wasn&#x27;t being too critical. The old one looked fine.  I am returning this.  I went to another store and found a newer model, opened the box and although it is also slightly distorted, it is much better than this one.  This is the only mfgr that I can find that includes the power outlet so I need to settle for less than perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very sad that many items I&#x27;ve owned in the past and have had to replace have been far inferior to the exact same original.  I know this is not a heart/lung machine that needs to be perfect and precise, but it makes me wonder where has craftsmanship and quality control gone?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see anywhere that the plug/voltage would not be appropriate for an Australian circuit. Would have been a great mirror and would have met my needs if it didn&#x27;t blow up and start smoking like crazy as soon as i plugged it in. Oh well, you live and learn!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS x100 !!! SUPER AWESOME</li>
    <li> I have always used a iighted makeup mirror and this one is as good as any.</li>
    <li> I just sold my old dresser because I don&#x27;t like it anymore. It&#x27;s old but not antique so I figured I&#x27;&#x27;d just get myself a drawer table and buy a separate mirror to complement it. I found this very attractive and I like the way it has 2 flap mirrors on the side. I like how I don&#x27;t have to turn my face sideways over and over again just get a good view of every angle of my face. I am also impressed with the light and magnification feature. It&#x27;s overall a fantastic mirror. I like the size. I can carry it when travelling for a few days.</li>
    <li> bought as gift and works better than expected.. great lighting and magnification.. couldn&#x27;t find locally at such a great price</li>
    <li> This item was packed in a box with the above items - books and 3 pack of Lysol.  There was NO packing material in the box.  2  of the 3 mirrors were broken.  When I opened the mirror box MANY pieces of broken glass fell onto the floor:  stepped on a piece - trip to hospital - surgery to remove glass - 8 stitches.  I want a refund, no more glass items for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror 5 months ago after reading many of the positive and negative reviews. Here is my experience on the top 3 issues many people wrote about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Lag time turning on - It is like people are describing a totally different product. In the 5 months that I have had this I have not experienced lag time at all. The unit lights up immediately upon turning it on. This has not failed once since I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Bulbs quickly burn out. Again, I have had this mirror for 5 months and it&#x27;s still going strong. No dimming - no flickering, nothing but reliable use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Distorted magnifying mirror. Here&#x27;s where I would somewhat agree. The mirror does distort when using the magnifier, but it&#x27;s not so bad that it is unusable. It&#x27;s just not as good a quality as another magnifier mirror I have. I do use the magnifier mirror regularly especially when tweezing eyebrows and to inspect my skin after facial treatment and it works just fine for those uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no problem in recommending this mirror. For the price you are getting a product that will do what it is supposed to do and has longevity.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  I had the first one for several years until the light finally stopped working.  Rather than looking for the appropriate replacement lights, I decided to purchase a new mirror.  It gives me all the light I need and the 2-way mirror is great when you need to apply makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very pleased with this mirror. I made the purchase by reading the reviews and there was more good than bad. The lighting is horrible for my use so I passed it along to my granddaughter and she is happy with it. I was expecting a much brighter light and the mirror to have a decent magnifier. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I had one of these when I was a teen. Just as good as I remember. Different lighting choices, &amp; you can see so clearly. A must for putting on makeup. I love it! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Not as big or as good as the American version in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, but still very useful, with good quality mirrors.</li>
    <li> The first one came with a left light burning dimly.  The second one was fine for a few weeks then the lights stopped working.</li>
    <li> I bought this 3-fold lit mirror to replace another one I mistakenly left behind after a wonderful vacation. The magnification option of the center mirror is great in applying eyeliner or checking for any stray unwelcome eyebrow hairs. It is so easy to angle the side mirrors to be able to see BOTH sides of your face which is ideal for makeup and hair perfection. The lights in this are SO long lasting I have never needed to replace the bulbs and I use this every day. I will not be without this marvelous mirror....it folds so you don&#x27;t even see the mirrors once you&#x27;re done. A great invention which will blend in any decor and has a relatively small &amp;#34;footprint&amp;#34; when closed if you don&#x27;t have a lot of space. You owe it to yourself, after purchasing great beauty products and makeup, to LOOK your best self. This mirror is a perfect helper!!!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! Nice that is has an extra outlet available - very handy. The 5x magnification is nice to have too! Turns on instantly and shifts smoothly for different lighting.</li>
    <li> Everything I was looking for in a mirror. lighting is great, electrial plug in front, great mirror clairity, love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I ignored the negative reviews and chose to purchase the mirror anyway!  It&#x27;s a great mirror, and the lights are plenty bright.  I have to say, the negative reviews people have given about dim or flickering lights really annoy me, because the manufacturers took the time to write in the instructions, and in a special product insert, AND on a sticker placed directly on the mirror that if you experience dim or flickering lights when turn it on the first time, all you need to do is turn the switch off and on rapidly several times to get the lights working properly.  They even apologize for the &amp;#34;inconvenience&amp;#34; of asking you to flip a switch a few times, and assure the mirror will work fine after that.  How people could miss instructions in THREE separate places and then whine that their mirror doesn&#x27;t work right is beyond me!  But this is a terrific mirror, great size, and I love the various setting for indoor and outdoor lighting types.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it now. I like that I can change the lighting as well. I only wish this product came in a larger size! Having an electric plug right on the base for styling appliances is also a neat little feature so you can style your hair right there, but I usually just plug my phone in there to charge!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying my makeup mirror, I am very happy with the Jerdon company.  They took the time to put great instructions in about the lighting system, I say 5 STARS up for them.</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to. We set it up on the wife and girls vanity so that they don&#x27;t have to hog the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Bad mirror, magnifier side impossible to use .... Don&#x27;t but ....  Buy the Conair brand instead ...</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Worth the money. Will never buy another brand!!!</li>
    <li> Flash back to to 70&#x27;s when I had a makeup mirror!  Has a great magnifying mirror for those of us who need it (and aren&#x27;t scared about seeing our skin flaws, lol)  Gives a great amount of light and mirrors can be adjust as needed.  It&#x27;s just a great product for the price.  I use it constantly....easier than bending over a vanity trying to see the mirror...&lt;br /&gt;This was my previous review, written in 2010....needless to say, I was very upset when the lightbulbs burned out (Dec. 2013).  I needed my mirror!!  I search high and low for replacement bulbs, but could not find any.  I went on the Jerdon website and contacted them to let them know my needs, and within 4 days from first message, I was \\&quot;seeing the light\\&quot; again!  Dealing with these people was a totally easy and pleasurable experience, with immediate results.  Not only do I love this product, I am thrilled with the company who backs up their product.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> A great make up mirror.  I had a similar one years ago and never used the various light situations -- just use the daylight one and go with it.  It is well made, the mirrors are a good size, easy to move the slant of the mirror.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  After having a Conair brand mirror for 15 plus years, I decided it was time to replace it and chose this Jerdon mirror.  Never again.  I had the mirror for approximately 32 days when the lights stopped working.  To make matters worse, it was only eligible for return within 30 days of purchase.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon that I&#x27;ve been disappointed with.</li>
    <li> Item is as described.  I am pleased with my purchase. Will recommend to others looking for like product. I like the light settings and feel more comfortable with my make up.</li>
    <li> Oh, I love this thing. Used to have one when I was a teenager and had forgotten how great it is to have one when putting on makeup. The lighting is adequate, but the mirror sizes are on the small side. The whole thing has a great tilting ability and the middle mirror spins around to help ya put on mascara or eye shadow. Really enjoy having it everyday. No more needing glasses to put on makeup!!</li>
    <li> My old mirror that lasted 30 years&lt;br /&gt;was replaced by this mirror 14 months ago&lt;br /&gt;Lights will not turn on and took&lt;br /&gt;mirror to hardware store to replace bulbs&lt;br /&gt;no way to open and replace the bulbs&lt;br /&gt;so - did not last too long&lt;br /&gt;but longer then some who purchased....</li>
    <li> This mirror is easy to use, has a wonderful quality of light, and a great feature is the side mirrors.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for two years before the bulbs burnt out.  I love it.  Called Jerdon directly and ordered the replacement bulbs for $10 total.  Will update my review once my fiance attempts to change them.</li>
    <li> I received defective. I lost my money, I do not recommend this product. Do not waste your time and money as happened to me with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s a great make up mirror.  The only thing that seemed a little cheap was the slider that changes the lighting.</li>
    <li> Gives a distorted view and the magnifying is not very good.  Disappointed</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used one of these since high school but a recent move and a new bathroom with the mirror too far away for my taste required another course of action. I&#x27;ve only had it in use for a few days but so far so good, I&#x27;m very please with it and wondering why I didn&#x27;t go back to using one of these years ago!</li>
    <li> I have no idea what the negative reviews were about, this mirror is great and easy to operate. The bulbs work just fine and I love that there is more than one setting</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this based on other reviews saying that the lighting was horrible. I&#x27;m glad I still got it because I couldn&#x27;t disagree more!! This gives me great light. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had or seen after looking for one on a million stores. It&#x27;s like your own mini vanity!</li>
    <li> This magnified mirror and light is the best to see all sides of your face. The different light modes help also. I love it!</li>
    <li> My daughters love these mirrors. Received for Christmas. Great gift.</li>
    <li> I simply love my mirror.  It was a gift card from my children for Christmas. Something I had always wanted, but was too cheap to purchase one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to apply my makeup with great ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommending to all who want to be able to see where to put enhancements where they are not.  (smile)</li>
    <li> This works great for me.  When I had my contarats done, I had trouble putting on my makeup and now I have the right magnification and a regular mirror all in one!  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second mirror now. The first one lasted 2 years until the bulbs burned out. This is a niftty mirror for the price and does it&#x27;s job. I love the magnified part for tweezing my brows and looking to see if there is something in my eye, and the regualr side is great for make-up. I rarely use the different lights because, well, I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;guru&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m just a spectacular woman that likes to wear makeup every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hate that the design is as basic as you can get. Remember the one that your mom had in the early 90s, well this is it. No sleekness, curves, round knobs, nothing. Just straight lines. A box. Like the old Ford Explorers. This definitely isn&#x27;t the Cadillac of mirrors,</li>
    <li> I returned another brand and bought this one. I love it. The lighting is very even with the tube lights on either side of the mirror. The 5x magnification is also a great feature.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for 2 1/2 years and it was great until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Decent lighting (although it could be a little brighter), swivel mirror was weighted well so it didn&#x27;t turn by itself while trying to use it, and it was highly adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It started flickering a few weeks ago and just quit lighting altogether.  My husband, the electrician, took it all apart to fix for me as it still looks great.  However the bulbs are soldered in and cannot be replaced.  Therefore the mirror is trash and I&#x27;m off shopping for one with replaceable bulbs.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my mother&#x27;s day gift. She uses this new jerdon every morning before work to apply her makeup. She had a very similar one made by Remington but it was from 1990, so it was time for a new surprise for mothers day. She loves it cause it like the old one, but with new features that make thing much easier for her. The only thing she wishes it had is a longer could to reach outlets without having to stretch. Otherwise all-around great product, the new one&#x27;s aren&#x27;t as good in so many ways.this is well worth the money which ain&#x27;t much for the long lasting quality. Amazon is awesome, can always find what you really want. Mattgecek@gmail.com</li>
    <li> This makeup mirror has the light settings and good lights I need and want.  It has easy to use settings and the electric plug on the front is an added bonus.  It is perfect for my needs and the price was very good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She loves it for that close-up work that needs to be done when you get a little older.  Convenient case and good color shades.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I had this mirror for 10 years and the bulbs burnt out. (To be expected) so I bought the exact same one and to my suprise they made some improvements. The light switch is a lot better, I don&#x27;t have to hold it down until the lights stay on. The mirror stays in place a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has a lot of features that I like. The two sided mirror, the bright lights, the ability to change the shading of the lights. I really like that I have three mirrors to see all sides of my makeup and that they all fold up when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> Am glad to finally have one of these mirrors again!!! I had one when i was younger,loved it!!! I didn&#x27;t think i would be able to get another one like it,but,this one is pretty much the same!!! My mom still has her two she&#x27;s had forever! Will tell friends and family!!! TY, M.Burnside :P :D</li>
    <li> This vanity has been a great unit for my traveling business in MUA. I would recommend this definatly.  Also am going to buy one for the girls in my family.</li>
    <li> The magnifying side of the mirror is distorted otherwise it&#x27;s fine.  Unfotunately I bought it for the magnified side. The Clairol I used to have was much better.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice mirror!  It has four options for light and I use all of them.</li>
    <li> The first time I used the slider to change the setting, it broke. I can only use it in daylight mode.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m regretting having given this mirror a chance.  About four months into using it mine died out of the blue.  I&#x27;ve tried the trick that some have reported in these reviews of holding down the on button, but that hasn&#x27;t worked for me.  To be honest, I&#x27;m confused as to how that could even work.  When I try to hold the button down the button doesn&#x27;t move at all so I don&#x27;t know what that could even do for it - but it&#x27;s definitely not working.  Next thing to do on my list is to try and figure out if I can return the thing.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Great price, Gonna order another for a gift.</li>
    <li> This is a decent mirror. However, I&#x27;m glad it was about half what it regularly is, because it doesnt stand up on the first notch. It falls forward, so I have to use it on any of the farther notches, which means the lights are always tilted back although the mirror is turned to be perpendicular to the table.  Not ideal when you want the lighting to be even.</li>
    <li> I love my Jerdon JGL9W Tri-Fold Lighted Mirror.  It is everything I expected!  Great price, too!</li>
    <li> Customer Service&lt;br /&gt;The lighting is not as bright as the previous mirror {the same model}&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not as happy with it.  But do not  know how to deal with it.Any&lt;br /&gt;suggestions?</li>
    <li> I looked all over for a mirror when mine broke. Finally found this one on Amazon, It is the perfect size and magnification for me. It fits my make up application needs perfectly. It is easy to open and close and also fits on my vanity. It came packed well. It is my second mirror from this company and I have been very satisfied. I also ordered a hanging mirror for my bathroom but it did not have great lighting so I ordered this mirror. It is much better than the brands I have found at local department stores. If you are looking for a well made mirror this is it. I highly recommend. The lighting features are nice being adjustable to the lighting you will be seen in. I usually use the natural lighting as I prefer that then adjust to see how it will look in evening light. That way if I am in brighter light I know how my make up will look. I find the magnification perfect for my needs when applying eyeliner, etc.. Overall this is the perfect mirror. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I just love this mirror.  Middle is regular and reverse magnified. Sides are regular. 4 levels of lighting. Closes up compactly.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and it is very durable and handy.</li>
    <li> The concept of this mirror is great - the 3 panes of glass, the outlet in the front, the different lighting options to make sure you look your best...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this mirror is extremely cheap.  The toggle that changes the lighting options falls off any time I try to move it to the right.  The good news is I really only like the day option, so I won&#x27;t be moving it much (if ever).  If I do actually try to change the lighting options, sometimes the different screens that provide the color don&#x27;t exactly line up the way that they should.  Sometimes I have to move the toggle back and forth multiple times before the screens line up properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is &#x27;meh&#x27;.  I was looking for a relatively cheap product for my vanity with lighting and would probably be more accepting of its flaws if the price point was lower.  I&#x27;m not really satisfied by this product, but it will do for now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that you can only close the mirrors in one position.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror !! It saved me !! I bought another brand lighted mirror first. When it arrived the switch was broken. I quickly returned it and ordered this one !! It saved my mothers Birthday !! Works great and she is happy !!</li>
    <li> It works great. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this brand rather than Conair based on other reviews saying it has better light. But I don&#x27;t think it is better than the Conair I had previously.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this!!! They do wear out eventually. This is our 3rd one in 20 years.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find no stars! Instead of a magnified mirror, it has a crazy mirror! I thought it was for an adult....going to send it back when I find out how.....never had to return anything to amazon .  Purchase from them often for years!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift.  She really likes it.</li>
    <li> This make up light is really a great product and the light is pretty bright. Some of the other make up lights my wife tried  just were not very bright. This one has good light. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for one of these.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Not very good would like to send it back</li>
    <li> this mirror is great, you can see EVERYTHING you wish wasn&#x27;t there haha, just what I needed. theres a warning sticker to let you know about the faulty lights if it happens and how to fix it (don&#x27;t have the problem with mine). many light options, awesome side views, and when I don&#x27;t have my glasses on and no contacts I can turn the mirror over and see pretty good for me being blind basically. I love it. its big, takes up my normal size vanity, but leaves space for my makeup and perfumes. it has many options on how to sit up, it folds to be put away. if you wanted to you could take it with you easily as well. I love it, its exactly what I wanted the price was great considering in stores for the same price was just little circle mirrors with crappy lights. love it thanks!</li>
    <li> I have often done my makeup at home, usually in my bedroom, and been happy with the result only to go outside and realize in the sun that my colors are really off. Either too much or not enough blush and a foundation that turns out too orange, dark, not evenly blended, etc. This totally solves those issues. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great mirror with great lighting.  I had a Clairol model for over 20 years which I loved but the stand finally broke and I had to get a new one.  These lights are really accurate with no glare so you can see clearly.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I expected this to be something that would last maybe 5 years. I could have been being too hopeful I guess. It lasted maybe 3. I wish there was a way that I knew to change the bulbs but I guess I just have to buy another. My last light color setting didn&#x27;t work either. When I got it, it seemed like it was jammed and wouldn&#x27;t rotate all the way over to the last setting. Not that it mattered, I only used it on one or two of them, but still. I enjoyed it while it was around. Then one day it would just keep turning off as I was trying to use it or not come on all the way and be very dim. It didn&#x27;t quite burn out but simply just died slowly lol. But yea... I&#x27;m gonna order another one... a different cheaper one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good one but it&#x27;s naturally not a lifetime purchase and some models are faulty... but not at all unuseable. You will love it. Makes you feel like a diva everyday and you can really get in there and see everything good and from a few different angles.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I have paid way more for way less at CVS! Great item, great price!</li>
    <li> The mirror has the option to rotate the middle mirror for different magnifications. The rotating mechanism was faulty and would not hold the mirror in a set position, constantly rotating around unless I placed a jam to hold it in place. Also, after only three months, the left bulb went out. My research is that the mirror has to be returned to the manufacturer for bulb replacement. There is no convenient method for replacing the bulb without taking the mirror apart. Would highly recommend another manufacturer for your makeup mirror purchase.</li>
    <li> I ended up sending this back</li>
    <li> No so good - reflection is quite distorted making it difficult to put make-up on.  Light is not so bright.  So sad  :(</li>
    <li> Love this I use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in a timely manner and packaged well&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to family and friends</li>
    <li> This lights on this mirror only worked for 2 months. It&#x27;s past the 30 day Amazon return policy, so I&#x27;m stuck with a mirror that won&#x27;t light up. It&#x27;s not the bulbs. They aren&#x27;t dark on the ends like they burnt out. It seems like a fuse or something just blew. It&#x27;s very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Works well, and compact enough not to take up too much room on the vanity.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this thing everyday.</li>
    <li> this  is a great gift.  exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and so easy to see in----Great product---buy with confidence-</li>
    <li> Poor quality, lamps quit working within 2 weeks, it has since been replaced due to the generous Amazon replacement policy and we are hopeful the second unit will last a little longer.</li>
    <li> Bulbs burnt out within weeks of use.  No simple way to replace bulbs or repair, a waste of $$$ in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love it I have no problem so far this mirror help me out the lighting could have been brighter but for the price am please and I can travel with it</li>
    <li> this is a great makeup mirror, but I have macular degeneration and was not able to see well due to the lighting even tho it had a 5x  magnification, not the fault of the item, it was me, so order it if you have good eyesight.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  It is super bright and compact, so it fits easily on my counter.  This mirror is so bright that it illuminates every thing on your face, which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it.  I like it because I can apply my makeup with perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a bright mirror, after the bulb on my [[ASIN:B008GSY7UM Jerdon JGL10W Euro Tabletop Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror with 5x Magnification and 4-Light Settings, White Finish]] died, and Jerdon seems to be the only one who continues to use these bright bulbs.  I bought this one, thinking it was the same mirror as the last Jerdon I had, but I picked the wrong model.  I&#x27;m glad I did, because this one takes up less space and it&#x27;s actually brighter then the other one ever was!  When this one dies, I will be buying another one!</li>
    <li> Use it every day!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Loving my new mirror. I just wish it would sit a little higher.</li>
    <li> Present for my mom. She loved it</li>
    <li> I love the Jerdon JGL9W lighted makeup mirror .I love the results using it after my makeup applied it looks 100 percent better I would recommend this product. Highly satisfied</li>
    <li> My daughter uess it almost everyday!!</li>
    <li> The light, even on the highest setting is still do dim to apply makeup. I bought this for my mother to use while visiting and the only way she could use it was to take it into a brightly lit room. I would like to try higher watt bulbs, but the instructions state that they should never be removed except by a service repair shop.</li>
    <li> The lighted mirror is of good quality, but the mirror is smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Love it just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> FOR THE PRICE IT IS BETTER THAN I ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. HAVING THREE MIRRORS AND THE DIFFERENT LIGHTING CAPABILITIES WAS A BONUS.</li>
    <li> I love love loved this mirror when it worked---bulbs went out in less than 6 months  I loved it so much I gave it another chance---bulbs went out AGAIN in less than 4 months. Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I put on make-up everyday. I am one of those people who, WITHOUT A DOUBT, needs a make up mirror that not only magnifies my face ENOUGH, but also gives me enough LIGHT to see what I am doing. I went on the search for the \\&quot;perfect mirror\\&quot; about 2 years ago after my \\&quot;CLAIROL\\&quot; died and was no longer manufactured.  I bought and tossed three mirrors before landing on the Jerdon.  I have since purchased 5:  One for my home, one for my summer home, one for my RV, and one for each of my daughters.  IT IS AWESOME!  BUY!BUY!BUY! You will love it.</li>
    <li> This broke with very little use. I found a way to work around it, and still use this mirror. The amount of light is great and I use the magnifying side to pluck my lovely mostache hairs (menopause sucks) and when I pluck my eyebrows. I even use it when my husband is in the shower and I need to put my make-up on.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised Great price for what it does.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I am able to see to apply my make up. Haven&#x27;t used it too much but it&#x27;s as descibed and does the job. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my wife. She truly liked it for all the features.&lt;br /&gt;It was a good value, well built, and a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by this item.  The bulbs were not bright enough for my needs.  Too late to send it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this almost daily since I purchased and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble. It lights up fine, although I don&#x27;t really see the use/need for the different &amp;#34;settings&amp;#34; of light. The magnified mirror is great for detail face make-up work or for tricky things like plucking and shaping brows.</li>
    <li> This is a hundred times better than what i WAS using. I love that you can change the light settings, and the flip feature for magnification is fabulous. The ONLY thing I would change is to make it mountable on a wall as I have to set it on something to bring it high enough on my vanity table. I&#x27;d rather stand up and do my makeup than hunch over a table</li>
    <li> Has a tendecy to easily slip off of support in the rear. Lighting is just ok.</li>
    <li> Recieved in great condition, it worked great, and she loves it.  Whats more to say...I would reccomend it to anyone that wants a great tri makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> between having to send first one back and that the lights are not the greatest. it&#x27;s ok but not the best product I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I just have to say this mirror is fantastic! I had previously owned the Conair tri-fold mirror before I bought this one. Worst mistake EVER! The lights went out after only 2 weeks of use. It was a disappointment, but based on the other reviews on that mirror, I should have expected that. Unlike the Conair tri-fold mirror, the Jerdon tri-fold mirror is an amazing product. I really recommend this for someone who is looking for all lighting situations from one mirror. I use this everyday, and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. Hope this is helpful for your future mirror shopping c:</li>
    <li> it is OK, don&#x27;t really use it</li>
    <li> Good product if it had lasted longer than a year. Although I got quite a start to see myself with such magnification. Wish the other brands had a tilt center mirror instead of swivel, but hopefully, this last one I got will last longer that 1 year.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted. Nice and bright and the Magnification is perfect. Have tried several other types of makeup mirrors and they were just not bright enough.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter fell in love with it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the side mirrors!!&lt;br /&gt;my other granddaughter now wants one too!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  It is a great mirror when pampering yourself.  I like the ability to change the lighting, and the magnification.</li>
    <li> This is better magnification than the 3x, but the open &#x27;not covered&#x27; bulbs that the older versions had were better. The lighting was better for older eyes and you could use the heat it produced to quickly warm up wax strips for facial hair removal. Still, it is better than the 3x. But just barely.</li>
    <li> Great for the money.  Very pleased.  Quite an upgrade from regular unlighted table mirrors.  Perfect solution if you have bad lighting in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> The slider for choosing lighting is cheap and hard to move at times.  I just leave it on brightest light.  That&#x27;s all you want anyway.  The mirrors work fine.  I wish the lights were even brighter!</li>
    <li> the plastic notch to change the type of lighting won&#x27;t even move! it has snapped off 5 times while i&#x27;ve tried to get it to move, to no avail. boyfriend couldn&#x27;t get it working either. wish i could return it but i&#x27;ve already thrown out the packaging.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Mom and it was just what she was looking for, nicer even than what she expected. The magnification is perfect and it is easy for her to use</li>
    <li> Still have this and going strong!  Sorry my review has been long in coming.  I forgot there was a place for this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> As other reviews have stated, it&#x27;s impossible to open this product to replace the bulbs. So whether they last a month or a year, eventually this product will just become a magnification mirror. I bought this on Jan 20 and almost exactly a month later the bulbs shorted out, and I had maybe used the mirror less than 10 times over the course of owning it.</li>
    <li> Ordered at the same time as the one above.  Now she wants mine because hers lost a light bulb.  Would order but little expensive to order another for her.  Should have order 2 of these instead of the J1010 6-inch above,</li>
    <li> Love having this To help with putting makeup o</li>
    <li> My wife has really liked this unit which I bought for her 26 months ago.  A few weeks ago the lights started to flicker so I thought I&#x27;d just replace the bulbs. Big problem: Come to find out that they&#x27;re not replaceable because they&#x27;re soldered into place.  So it&#x27;s a dead soldier. It was good while it lasted though. Don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll buy another but instead look for another that has replaceable bulbs.</li>
    <li> Excellent product very good lighting extra outlet everything you need excellent packing and seller&lt;br /&gt;Becca</li>
    <li> Part of wife&#x27;s Christmas presents.  She like it and that is all that counts.  She uses it every day.</li>
    <li> This product is utterly s*** and I wont be buying it again. After a month, the lights didnt work anymore. I dont know if what i got is a faulty product or this mirror is just not good at all</li>
    <li> I have had Jerndon makeup mirrors for over 20 years and have been very satisfied. The bulbs last about 5 years with everyday use and then you have to replace the mirror which is fine. This time when I replaced the mirror and flipped it over for the magnification side the mirror is so distorted you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing. I am sure there are many Baby Boomers like me who require the magnification side and I would tell you this mirror is useless now. The quality of the mirror has deteriorated from the 20 years experience I have had with it. Very disappointing. Don&#x27;t buy it if you think you&#x27;ll ever need the magnification side.</li>
    <li> I use the mirror every day to put my make-up on.  The two sided mirrors are helpful when I want to look at something on the side of my face. The lights give my a chance to really see my face when I&#x27;m in the dark.  The return policy is wonderful.  I had to return one when the lights did not work after 8 months.  I received a new one with absolutely no cost and no problem.</li>
    <li> This makeup mirror is very bright and very easy to use. No problems works well does all I want it to</li>
