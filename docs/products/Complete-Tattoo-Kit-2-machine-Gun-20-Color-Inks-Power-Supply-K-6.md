      <li>For $38 you cant beat it and they have good customer service.</li>
      <li>but it is actually really good.</li>
      <li>great price, great machines, and it came very quick in the mail.</li>
      <li>It is more for the awesome light weight guns and power supply than anything else.</li>
      <li>Great guns cheap price did not get the power supply that I thought was supposed to come with it</li>
      <li>nice power supply</li>
      <li>nice work</li>
      <li>it was a nice set ou</li>
      <li>but good guns crappy powwr supply nothing but a light and nob nothing to tell you voltage</li>
      <li>the width of a nickel or dime between bar and coil make sure you use allen wrench provided in kit or will not tighten up</li>
      <li>more in and needles and stronger wire already had to soder my gun cord</li>
      <li>but it was okay for the price</li>
      <li>just wish it came with more supplies.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>and I doubted they were safe to use.</li>
      <li>I could have gotten a much better kit for $10 more.</li>
      <li>And I already started using it. &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>The package deal was awesome, as long as you have been around tat setups before and know how to set them up.</li>
      <li>It was a good choose for it to be my first tattoo gun..  </li>
      <li>Should me more strong</li>
      <li>I strongly advise you to look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>The ink is cheap as well as the guns.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for some light weight durable tattoo guns these are the ones.</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy the&lt;br /&gt;gun as they have dollar bills.</li>
      <li>it has been very useful</li>
      <li>Did a tat the first day with one gun, worked fine.</li>
      <li>This product is lucky to even get the 2 stars that it got.</li>
      <li>Both machines work great when tuned properly, everything works really well.</li>
      <li>i love my new gun.</li>
      <li>also if you can, go ahead and get better ink, the ones included are great with the practice skin but would not recommend on real skin due to the low quality of the ink, but like i said it is a good setup especially for begginners</li>
      <li>right then the vibration will loosen it and it will not run right.</li>
      <li>Again, these are all pretty expected issues, but where the kit counts, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
      <li>If you are going to put something on your body permanently then it definitely shouldn&#x27;t be done with this brand of cheap ink or these cheap guns.</li>
      <li>The third reason is because the needles were clearly very cheap</li>
      <li>The ink fades and the guns got too hot to handle.</li>
      <li>I hope to order more of the same products soon.</li>
      <li>i used the first one the first day it arrived it broke with five minutes.</li>
      <li>The coils get hot super fast and if the power supply is turned up too high</li>
      <li>Most of the time the ink saturates well, and sticks as long as you are willing to do a touch-up.</li>
      <li>Kit was great but the ink sucks it dosent stay intact in the skin very well.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using the ink on a large piece however.</li>
      <li>I would for sure get some better ink such as MOM&#x27;S or Prism for colors and Kukkai Sumi Tribal for your black and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
      <li>r ok I would spend a little more money and get a digital power supply from ebay</li>
      <li>Thanks again I got everything in this pic</li>
      <li>stops constantly, none of the parts fit..</li>
      <li>thanks amazon.</li>
      <li>I was very dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>Well I got it ready to use and the power supply don&#x27;t stay working</li>
      <li>other than that i love it</li>
      <li>Throw in a couple shading needles and it would have been decent.</li>
      <li>Most of the time, if you tune it properly, and are loading your needle properly, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
      <li>but they are sending a new one.</li>
      <li>The gun I have been practicing with keeps coming loose, the screw on top turns from vibration and is loose and needs tweaking.</li>
      <li>they said thanks but,,,,,the black one not made correctly he need a repair shop to take it in an get it tuned right but</li>
      <li>If it would have come with at least a carrying case and ink cap holder than this would be better.</li>
      <li>dont worry it might not be broke check how far the armature bar is away from the coil tighten screw till its bout</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t send it back to get a new one..</li>
      <li>dont really have much else to say except i feel like it was a waste of my time investing in this tattoo kit.</li>
      <li>I was overall surprised at the quality of the kit.</li>
      <li>anyone ready to start tattoo&#x27;s should get this kit plus some of the other tattoo stuff I pick up.</li>
      <li>only thing is that if your going to buy this set your going to want to buy extra tubes and tips, as it only comes with a small lining tip and needle,  you also want to go ahead and get extra rubberband, ink caps, orings and grommets, cause you will go through the ones the give you quick.</li>
      <li>On the matter of the ink, some of it is good, some is bad.</li>

<li> On the matter of the ink, some of it is good, some is bad.</li>
<li> the tattoo guns barely work the adjustment keeps walking out and the other one does not run at all .</li>
<li> The inks are fake Kuro Sumi, probably filled with toxins.</li>
<li> The power supply is legit as well however this kit comes with minimal supplies such as orings, grommets, rubberbands, needles, etc.</li>
<li> Have ordered other products since.</li>
<li> If You Have ANY Other Options.</li>
<li> Other machine didnt work at all</li>
<li> Not worth the time or the money.</li>
<li> but the ink is decent for fake skin but shouldnt be used on humans at all.</li>
<li> Kit isnt bad for your dollar ,to get you started , recommonded , you have some knowledge on how to set up , your machines , before purchase , would have been cool if a sheet of transfer paper would have came with it</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not good for actual tattooing, just a practice toy set.</li>
<li> Machines are ugly, disk is unreadable, no instructions, but for practicing on fruit or learning the tools and uses it&#x27;s cool.</li>
<li> The DVD didn&#x27;t work on my computer of DVD player and the foot pedal is to small for me but other than that it works.</li>
<li> but i had a piece missing</li>
<li> it shoots small sparks from the machine.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed however for three reasons; the tips are pretty crappy and how they were packaged was unprofessional and unsanitary.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s poorly made and a waste of money.</li>
<li> Also slowly turn up the power supply or you will burn the gun out .</li>
<li> it did not come with a powere cord, the guns are not good because of the way they are made.</li>
<li> Not good quality for the novice or pro.</li>
<li> but i got the wrong kit .</li>
<li> no tattoo artist or anything because im  a beginner and just wanted to try my hand on fake skin.</li>
<li> I noticed alot of people saying this kit is bad</li>
<li> Dont listen to the bad reviews</li>
<li> it&#x27;s just idiots that don&#x27;t know how to operate this.</li>

    <li> Kit isnt bad for your dollar ,to get you started , recommonded , you have some knowledge on how to set up , your machines , before purchase , would have been cool if a sheet of transfer paper would have came with it so dont forget , to purchase some with your order ,</li>
    <li> If you are looking for some light weight durable tattoo guns these are the ones. The power supply is legit as well however this kit comes with minimal supplies such as orings, grommets, rubberbands, needles, etc. It is more for the awesome light weight guns and power supply than anything else. I would for sure get some better ink such as MOM&#x27;S or Prism for colors and Kukkai Sumi Tribal for your black and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
    <li> tattoo machines stop working. both of them. i used the first one the first day it arrived it broke with five minutes. the second one i did three tattoos and that one broke ass well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not good for actual tattooing, just a practice toy set. The inks are fake Kuro Sumi, probably filled with toxins. I got a tattoo with chinese ink once, still aches at times....just making a point.... Machines are ugly, disk is unreadable, no instructions, but for practicing on fruit or learning the tools and uses it&#x27;s cool. For the price, I ain&#x27;t trippin&#x27;</li>
    <li> The ink is cheap as well as the guns. The ink fades and the guns got too hot to handle. Not good quality for the novice or pro. If you are going to put something on your body permanently then it definitely shouldn&#x27;t be done with this brand of cheap ink or these cheap guns.</li>
    <li> Kit was great but the ink sucks it dosent stay intact in the skin very well. But everything else is awesome 4 out of 5</li>
    <li> It was a good choose for it to be my first tattoo gun..  like that it came whit to gun , ink, and needles..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed about my bought and I needed return my order because the power supply did not work. Should me more strong</li>
    <li> Both machines work great when tuned properly, everything works really well. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed however for three reasons; the tips are pretty crappy and how they were packaged was unprofessional and unsanitary. The kit came without an ink holder, however a bit of petroleum jelly on your sheeting, and you&#x27;re all set. The third reason is because the needles were clearly very cheap and I doubted they were safe to use. Again, these are all pretty expected issues, but where the kit counts, it&#x27;s a good deal. On the matter of the ink, some of it is good, some is bad. Most of the time, if you tune it properly, and are loading your needle properly, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using the ink on a large piece however. Most of the time the ink saturates well, and sticks as long as you are willing to do a touch-up. I was overall surprised at the quality of the kit.</li>
    <li> This is the worst tattoo kit I have ever bought. It didn&#x27;t come with ink cap holder or carrying case or anything like that. Didn&#x27;t come with any shader needles - only liner needles. Also, one of the machines doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL. Not worth the time or the money. Crappiest kit I&#x27;ve ever bought. I strongly advise you to look elsewhere. I could have gotten a much better kit for $10 more. Do Not Get This Kit If You Have ANY Other Options. If it would have come with at least a carrying case and ink cap holder than this would be better. Throw in a couple shading needles and it would have been decent. This product is lucky to even get the 2 stars that it got. I was very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal and every thing works and does a great job I have done a lot of tattoos cause of this .</li>
    <li> power supply only worked once. dont really have much else to say except i feel like it was a waste of my time investing in this tattoo kit.</li>
    <li> the Tattoo gun is wonderful and performed well, I would recommend it to anyone. It was a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> The DVD didn&#x27;t work on my computer of DVD player and the foot pedal is to small for me but other than that it works.</li>
    <li> The product is very wonderful. My package was on time and I really enjoy the&lt;br /&gt;gun as they have dollar bills. I like the power pack as well it has been very useful&lt;br /&gt;and I hope to order more of the same products soon.</li>
    <li> Everything was good and also a great deal I loved everything about this order even the tattoo colors and everything else.</li>
    <li> this is terrible im pissed off everytime i turn it on it stops constantly, none of the parts fit.. this  product is S*** do not buy..</li>
    <li> it did not come with a powere cord, the guns are not good because of the way they are made.</li>
    <li> great price, great machines, and it came very quick in the mail. machines run awesome, power supply is good for begginners. only thing is that if your going to buy this set your going to want to buy extra tubes and tips, as it only comes with a small lining tip and needle,  you also want to go ahead and get extra rubberband, ink caps, orings and grommets, cause you will go through the ones the give you quick. also if you can, go ahead and get better ink, the ones included are great with the practice skin but would not recommend on real skin due to the low quality of the ink, but like i said it is a good setup especially for begginners, maches are great just wish it came with more supplies. hope this helps</li>
    <li> The gun I have been practicing with keeps coming loose, the screw on top turns from vibration and is loose and needs tweaking.</li>
    <li> it was a nice set ou but i got the wrong kit . but i am still happy with it..</li>
    <li> Alright for beginners. Wasnt looking for anything fancy to begin with but the ink is decent for fake skin but shouldnt be used on humans at all. Im no tattoo artist or anything because im  a beginner and just wanted to try my hand on fake skin. The coils get hot super fast and if the power supply is turned up too high it shoots small sparks from the machine.</li>
    <li> i got a call an they said thanks but,,,,,the black one not made correctly he need a repair shop to take it in an get it tuned right but nice work the white one do</li>
    <li> Great guns cheap price did not get the power supply that I thought was supposed to come with it but good guns crappy powwr supply nothing but a light and nob nothing to tell you voltage</li>
    <li> more in and needles and stronger wire already had to soder my gun cord but it was okay for the price</li>
    <li> DO not buy this tattoo kit!! I bought it and with in five Minutes the power supply went out. I know how to run a tattoo gun and it shouldn&#x27;t go out like that. It&#x27;s poorly made and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> the tattoo guns barely work the adjustment keeps walking out and the other one does not run at all .</li>
    <li> i love my new gun. it has been just the addition i need in my life. It is so lightweight yet sturdy and fashionable too!!!</li>
    <li> I love it but i had a piece missing but it was no biggie. other than that i love it</li>
    <li> Well I got it ready to use and the power supply don&#x27;t stay working and I can&#x27;t send it back to get a new one..that&#x27;s bull if ya asked me</li>
    <li> Thanks again I got everything in this pic plus I think. nice power supply anyone ready to start tattoo&#x27;s should get this kit plus some of the other tattoo stuff I pick up. I got everything from all my orders as said in description if you a still worried don&#x27;t be I got what they said.</li>
    <li> The package deal was awesome, as long as you have been around tat setups before and know how to set them up. however the power supply that came with did not work properly. I borrowed a power unit from a buddy and everything else was great tho. Although i did not need the cd that came with i couldnt get it to play on any device</li>
    <li> Did a tat the first day with one gun, worked fine. Other machine didnt work at all but they are sending a new one. For $38 you cant beat it and they have good customer service.</li>
    <li> I noticed alot of people saying this kit is bad but it is actually really good. If you do buy this item and it doesnt work dont worry it might not be broke check how far the armature bar is away from the coil tighten screw till its bout the width of a nickel or dime between bar and coil make sure you use allen wrench provided in kit or will not tighten up right then the vibration will loosen it and it will not run right. Also slowly turn up the power supply or you will burn the gun out . Dont listen to the bad reviews it&#x27;s just idiots that don&#x27;t know how to operate this. BOo</li>
    <li> power supply quit working would not recommend to anyone machines r ok I would spend a little more money and get a digital power supply from ebay</li>
    <li> Although I got it a day after it was supposed to come, I loved it. Everything was there plus! And I already started using it. &#x3D;] thanks amazon. (Wish It came with bigger bottles of color though. This will for for quite some time.)</li>
    <li> Great product. Have ordered other products since. Arrived as described</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. A lot of stuff for the price. And everything works great.</li>
