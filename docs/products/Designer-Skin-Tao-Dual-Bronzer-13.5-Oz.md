      <li>This lotion is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Seems to give me a nice golden color.</li>
      <li>worked good.  very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>This one actually smells good!</li>
      <li>I liked the scent so much!  </li>
      <li>it also made my skin feel so silky smooth.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and goes smoothly.  </li>
      <li>This is a great lotion if you have dry skin, as I do.  </li>
      <li>I found the same lotion on line here and got it quick and easy at a very reasonable price that I was happy to pay.</li>
      <li>After the first day (and spending too little time in the bed), I was impressed by some of the effects.</li>
      <li>All in all, not bad.</li>
      <li>Not bad though.  </li>
      <li>I had kind of settled with just being really light skinned for the rest of my life (since I&#x27;m a red head), but by tanning and using tao</li>
      <li>The thing I like the most about this particular lotion is the scent and the feel of it.</li>
      <li>I usually use Almost Famous and was looking for a product to give a bronzed look, and wanted to make sure I&#x27;m using one of the better products available.  </li>
      <li>it did a great job getting me dark (in and out of the tanning bed)</li>
      <li>Thanks for making it so easy.</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and have VERY dry skin, but this did a great job getting me dark and moisturizing my skin.  </li>
      <li>love the soft scent</li>
      <li>This product is worth your money if you want even results.</li>
      <li>It keeps its original smell really well even after the tan</li>
      <li>The price was right also.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;ve always been quick to get a tan (rarely burn), but the change in color is remarkable (only after my second time).</li>
      <li>Great indoor tanning lotion for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want the normal odor/perfumes associated with other tanning lotions.  </li>
      <li>It worked better than my normal tingle product and it doesn&#x27;t streak like normally bronzers</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t tan with it, at least you&#x27;ll have great looking and feeling skin.</li>
      <li>You know there is nothing better than being tan in the winter while all your pasty friends are so white...</li>
      <li>I been a avid indoor tanner for 20 years.</li>
      <li>I have nice even tan and extremely moisturized skin.</li>
      <li>This is the first indoor tanning lotion that I really like the smell of after tanning</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I would love to review this product except I never received it and aside from not getting it replaced was out the money spent on it.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for the speedy delivery&lt;</li>
      <li>I own my commercial tanning bed for personal use.</li>
      <li>So I know a little about indoor tanning to give a complete honest opinion.</li>
      <li>i have tried many expensive tanning lotions and i absolutly love this lotion.</li>
      <li>highly highly recomend this lotion.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend ordering from this company.  </li>
      <li>If you want a tanning lotion that will give you results, not an over powering smell before, during or after, soft skin than try this!!</li>
      <li>can (I normally don&#x27;t use them because it it).</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price here on Amazon verses the price in the actual tanning salons.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bronzer but enough to get a golden shimmer.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for those &gt;45 yr old people like myself.</li>
      <li>Now, normally I am loyal to my tingle effect lotion (which I will keep nameless), but aftershowing up one day without my lotion I had tried a sample packet of Toa after taking the owner of the tanning salon&#x27;s advise for a \\&quot;most sold product and you will automatically love as much if not more than you old lotion\\&quot; substitute.</li>
      <li>but it is the exact same thing.</li>
      <li>Will I purchase again over my previous lotion, most definitely!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These tanning lotions cost ridiculous prices at the actual tanning salons - sometimes $60 - $100 for a bottle of lotion! They work great but the price in my mind is way too much. I found the same lotion on line here and got it quick and easy at a very reasonable price that I was happy to pay. Thanks. I will purchase again here as needed. The product was brand new and same quality as I expected.</li>
    <li> I already loved the product so knew what I was getting, but the quick, efficient and great price were just the icing on the cake.  Highly recommend ordering from this company.  Thanks for making it so easy.</li>
    <li> I started Tanning last Year, &amp; salon recomened me to use TAO BRONZER.  I have to say. I have only tried other 2 tanning lotions.  This one as my 3rd, and i have to say ITS AN AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!!  You get results Fast, Beautiful Bronze Tan color &amp; smooth silky skin!!!  I LOVEE ITTT!!!  NEVER AGAIN WILL I SWITCH TO ANOTHER!  keep in mind, this lotion has ANTI-AGING &amp; FIRMS SKIN as you tan!!!  NOT many tanning lotions have this!!  TAO DUAL BRONZER ROCKS!!!! AND I RECOMMEND TO ANYONEE!!</li>
    <li> tried a sample at the tanning salon...it&#x27;s a great accelerator but is also works as a moistureizer...love the soft scent</li>
    <li> This was an okay tanning product.  It was good for a boost but I could hardly recognize the bronzers.  If you are looking for a bronzing lotion, I would definately try something different.</li>
    <li> love it but there are better ones out there, it&#x27;s trial and error</li>
    <li> I would love to review this product except I never received it and aside from not getting it replaced was out the money spent on it. Have had good experiences w/Amazon in past but this one was not one of them.</li>
    <li> ordered the bronzer and received it within just a few days! I&#x27;ve purchased this same bronzer for nearly $60 at the tanning salon in the past, could kick myself for not looking for it online! Love the stuff! Highly recommend it for those &gt;45 yr old people like myself.</li>
    <li> Now, normally I am loyal to my tingle effect lotion (which I will keep nameless), but aftershowing up one day without my lotion I had tried a sample packet of Toa after taking the owner of the tanning salon&#x27;s advise for a \\&quot;most sold product and you will automatically love as much if not more than you old lotion\\&quot; substitute. After the first day (and spending too little time in the bed), I was impressed by some of the effects. I didn&#x27;t think it could hold up to my other lotion, but I didn&#x27;t mind how nice, soft, and firm it left my skin. After an upgrade the second time by adding only 2 minutes onto my time in the bed and using the rest of my Toa sample packet, I was amazed by how much darker I got. Now, I&#x27;ve always been quick to get a tan (rarely burn), but the change in color is remarkable (only after my second time). I highly recommend this product to anyone. It worked better than my normal tingle product and it doesn&#x27;t streak like normally bronzers can (I normally don&#x27;t use them because it it). I have nice even tan and extremely moisturized skin. Not to mention, it smells great and has anti-aging in it too, something to think about as you let a sun-bed bake your skin&#x27;s youth away (I&#x27;m young enough not to care, but old enough to realize I probably should). This product is worth your money if you want even results. If you don&#x27;t tan with it, at least you&#x27;ll have great looking and feeling skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty pale person, and I don&#x27;t tan easily if I&#x27;m lucky enough to tan at all. Tao has given me really great results though! I had kind of settled with just being really light skinned for the rest of my life (since I&#x27;m a red head), but by tanning and using tao I&#x27;m now a few shades darker and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with burning. It also smells really nice. I let a coworker/friend borrow it, and she fell in love with it as well. It keeps its original smell really well even after the tan so you don&#x27;t walk around with that kind of burnt scent on you all day.</li>
    <li> I really love this product it is the best tanning lotion i have ever used.....leaves a very good smell and leaves the skinf perfectly smooth</li>
    <li> The product is amazing and everyone loves it. It took a little while to get it here, but it was worth the wait, since you can&#x27;t get it in stores.</li>
    <li> After giving DS Queen a somewhat scathing review, I thought I better let you know that not all DS products are created equally.  I LOVE Tao...it did a great job getting me dark (in and out of the tanning bed) I took it on my cruise last year and came home BROWN!  I am fair skinned and have VERY dry skin, but this did a great job getting me dark and moisturizing my skin.  The smell is SOOOOO much better than Queen (not perfumey, but not beachy either).  I mixed it with my regular everyday lotion I liked the scent so much!  Guess I will have to be using awesome Amazon to order this product though since my salon quit carrying it!  That&#x27;s OK...cheaper here anyway!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells the best when you put it on and even after you go tanning!  It makes your skin so silky and helps you tan a tiny bit faster than normal.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the speedy delivery&lt;br /&gt;of Tao.  The price was right also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Jo</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting which was perfect as I conducted a good amount of third party research on products that would benefit me</li>
    <li> Great indoor tanning lotion for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want the normal odor/perfumes associated with other tanning lotions.  Great results without burning at all.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s some days I actually just use this when I go outside to increase my tan and I absolutely love the smell</li>
    <li> You will not be disappointed with this tanning lotion and this is another company I purchased this from.  I did not have a bad experience with the customer service and FAST shipping!!  If you want a tanning lotion that will give you results, not an over powering smell before, during or after, soft skin than try this!!</li>
    <li> Nice texture and a good spreading quality, but I do not see any difference tan wise between any of these lotions.</li>
    <li> I usually use Almost Famous and was looking for a product to give a bronzed look, and wanted to make sure I&#x27;m using one of the better products available.  I tried this product for a week and was not very pleased.  I tan very easily and was hoping for something great! It took a week to do what Almost Famous does in a day - not going to order again, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I always Tan well with the product. The Fragrance is  soothing and relaxing. I will  and have recommended the product.</li>
    <li> The bronzer does what it needs to do and the lotion has a nice smell to it and very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I felt a little uneasy ordering tanning lotion on here bc its SOOO much cheaper than at the salon but it is the exact same thing. i have tried many expensive tanning lotions and i absolutly love this lotion. IT SMELLS AMAZING. the best smell tanning lotion i have ever used. love love love it. it also made my skin feel so silky smooth. highly highly recomend this lotion. i like that it DOESNT make u streaky and doesnt have crazy broners in it doesnt make u feel like u shower and lost your tan.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it when it goes on but like most tanning lotions, they don&#x27;t seem to continue that &#x27;nice&#x27; smell after tanning. Seems to give me a nice golden color.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different brands of lotions and this is one of my favorites. Has the right amount of bronzer and leaves you feeling and smelling good after tanning.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that i can still order on linne.it is nice when i use it for indoor tan, make my skin look darker and smooth&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Always loved this tanning lotion.. Even a lady who works at the tanning salon said its the best she&#x27;s smelled,, and its her favorite.. :-) so I told her where to get it</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  This is the first indoor tanning lotion that I really like the smell of after tanning</li>
    <li> worked good.  very moisturizing.  i got a very nice even color with this product.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I know this isn&#x27;t one of the best products that Designer Skin has to offer but it does an okay job. I started off rather fair before tanning but after a month I noticed this product stopped working for me. I definitley did not get the color I was hoping for but I can&#x27;t say that I didn&#x27;t get any color at all from this product because I did. It helped with getting a base tan but nothing more that I could build on. The smell is nice and like most of the Designer Skin products the moisture retintion from this product is amazing. So if your looking for a lotion that will help you build past a base tan you probably have the wrong lotion.</li>
    <li> Was using Smoke, the black bottle before this. Smoke had me smelling like garbage when I cam out of tanning. This one actually smells good! I did notice I had to apply a lot of lotion in order for me to notice a color change. So it took a little getting use to that(with my other lotion I didn&#x27;t have to apply a lot) All in all, not bad. Will I purchase again over my previous lotion, most definitely!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion if you have dry skin, as I do.  It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bronzer but enough to get a golden shimmer.  The best part about this lotion is the moisture it locks in.  It is not greasy and goes smoothly.  Even after I shower, I can still feel the moisture in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have dry skin and are not looking for a dark bronzer, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great product!</li>
    <li> I like the product dont get me wrong . I been a avid indoor tanner for 20 years. I own my commercial tanning bed for personal use. So I know a little about indoor tanning to give a complete honest opinion. Some things you can buy cheaper and they are just as good. Tanning lotion is one of those things. At this price I got a 4 quad bronzer for the same price. Worship Me on amazon . In my opinion anything over 4 bronzers is just a waste. I tanned 5 days a week to get my dark tan . I now tan 2-3 times 15 mins a session per week to keep that tan. You know there is nothing better than being tan in the winter while all your pasty friends are so white...</li>
    <li> I am always on the hunt for a new indoor tanning lotion, so I tend to buy several different brands per year. I bought this as a recommendation from a friend and I really like it. I cannot say that I saw a drastic change in skin color, but I did notice a slight difference. The thing I like the most about this particular lotion is the scent and the feel of it. The scent is pleasant and very clean and it does not give you that &amp;#34;tanning bed skin&amp;#34; smell afterward. It isn&#x27;t as greasy as other lotions I have tried either. It does not leave you feeling slimy and dirty after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for someone who is looking for a lotion that smells good, refreshes your skin and maintains your tan. Definitely worth the price here on Amazon verses the price in the actual tanning salons.</li>
    <li> This lotion is pretty good.  It has a descent bronzer,  but it&#x27;s a little tacky and you have to shower after tanning.  Not bad though.  I would buy it again if the price was $20 bucks or under.</li>
    <li> This tans well and has absolutely no after tan application smell....  It also makes the skin so soft.  I can use it often as I like.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer, no tingle,gives a lovely tan.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this product for about 4  years now,&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
