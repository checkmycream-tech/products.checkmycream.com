      <li>The smell is heavenly and natural - feels great on skin.</li>
      <li>- it smelled great, all natural, paraben-free and cruelty-free and wanted to try it out.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and washes off so easily!  </li>

      <li>and this cleanser got rid of them right away with no scrubbing.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough for sensitive skin, and a great makeup remover as well.</li>
      <li>I looked long and hard for a good paraben-free cleanser before I found the Zia Basics fresh cleansing gel with sea algae, and I absolutely loved it.  </li>
      <li>My facial skin is very smooth.</li>
      <li>Cleans my face pretty well.</li>
      <li>I stopped being able to find it in the stores locally.</li>
      <li>For awhile I thought they were discontinuing this cleanser which has been a natural clean choice throughout the years.</li>
      <li>met this cleansing gel for the first time at a Whole Foods Market two years ago</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam (in case people are expecting that) and has a very neutral reaction with the skin - no weird tingling or anything like that.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>

      <li>Removes make up, leaves skin clean not dry and not oily.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up, but it cleans really well getting all the makeup off.</li>
      <li>I had very oily skin/acne as a teenager and into my twenties.  </li>
      <li>I wash my face with it for about a minute and then gently buff it off under water with a micro fiber wash cloth.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle cleansing.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really foam up at all and smells like burning plastic.</li>
      <li>I used to buy it from Whole Foods</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nourishing.</li>
      <li>and this cleanser is very calming.</li>
      <li>We both have found that the Zia Basic fresh cleansing gel with sea algae helps our skin.</li>
      <li>Not delicate skin</li>
      <li>I tried the new aloe based skin cleanser and tossed it out because it burned my skin.</li>
      <li>My face feels refreshed and new after.</li>
      <li>It is so gentle that I can even wash my eyelashes (important, especially if you have dry eyes) without any irritation-no tears.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
      <li>My skin is oily all over and very sensitive.  </li>
      <li>I looked up the ingredients and found out that the cleansing ingredient in it is for very sensitive skin, so</li>
      <li>For one thing, it is very gentle and left my skin feeling soft and not dried-out.</li>
      <li>Also, I have hard-to-clean large pores on my nose where blackheads have a tendency to form - gross</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin, so this cleanser works well for me.  </li>
      <li>I have unbelievably sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Better late than never, I guess.</li>
      <li>I have been using Zia Natural products for about 8 years or so</li>
      <li>This cleans my sensitive skin thoroughly without drying it out.</li>
      <li>The aloe vera and seaweed make my skin feel soft.  </li>
      <li>but until then, I don&#x27;t recommend this product, particularly if your skin is at all sensitive, or you like to avoid alcohols in your facial products like I do.</li>
      <li>I am currently 41 and have normal skin that can tend to be a bit oily; the Zia products for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin work well for me.  </li>
      <li>I have taken it back, and stocked up on the old formula through online suppliers.  </li>
      <li>I have combination skin (oily t-zone) with occasional adult acne.</li>
      <li>I cringed using the other cleansers on my face because they irritated it so much.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Zia Fresh Cleansing Gel for about 18 years, this is the one and only, hands down!</li>
      <li>It will absolutly NOT dry out your skin in any way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only cleanser that makes my skin feel clean without being tight or dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a decade. it is excellent! Works beautifully with my 60-something skin and the skin of my 30-something daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. Fresh clean smell, gentle on skin. I look years younger than my age.</li>
    <li> I started using this cleansing gel about 4 years ago and immediately noticed a wonderful change in my skin. For one thing, it is very gentle and left my skin feeling soft and not dried-out. Also, I have hard-to-clean large pores on my nose where blackheads have a tendency to form - gross I know - and this cleanser got rid of them right away with no scrubbing. Since I can now only find it online, I decided one month to skip it and go with another product, but after a week or so I noticed my skin feeling a lot drier and the blackheads were back...I love Zia Seaweed Cleansing gel! I&#x27;ll not switch again!</li>
    <li> I have been using Zia Fresh Cleansing Gel for about 18 years, this is the one and only, hands down! I will recommend it to everyone and anyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> Cleans my face pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t really foam up at all and smells like burning plastic. But I bought it for cleaning my face, not smelling it.</li>
    <li> Wish it were easier to find; this is the best stuff for when your skin is sunburnt, or post-facial. It&#x27;s gentle and feels soothing and healing, yet isn&#x27;t at all greasy or filmy. Excellent product, well-worth the money.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily all over and very sensitive.  It breaks out badly when I use most cleansers, so it&#x27;s very hard for me to find one that my skin likes.  After trying *49* (so not kidding) other cleansers when L&#x27;Oreal stopped making the one that I was using, I finally found this one.  I cringed using the other cleansers on my face because they irritated it so much.  My skin went \\&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\\&quot; with relief when I tried this.  I love it!      I looked up the ingredients and found out that the cleansing ingredient in it is for very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t bother me (it turns out that it&#x27;s the same one as in the L&#x27;Oreal cleanser that I was using).  And I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam since foam/lather irritates my skin.  The aloe vera and seaweed make my skin feel soft.  What a waste of money trying all those other cleansers.  I wish I&#x27;d know about this one at the start.  Better late than never, I guess.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash for people with sensitive skin or contact wearers.  Absolutely non irritating and you can wash you face without anything stinging your eyes.  I have been using this stuff for over 10 years and will not replace it with anything.  I can&#x27;t find any stores that sell this anymore, so love that Amazon now carries it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best facial cleansers I have found. It&#x27;s gentle and effective, and leaves my skin looking bright and beautiful. Gentle enough for sensitive skin, and a great makeup remover as well.The ylang ylang scent is beautiful too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  You beat the beauty supply place by $4 per bottle.  No wonder they have dropped the item.  It has been great for my face.  I use it prior to shaving.  I am over 75.  My facial skin is very smooth.</li>
    <li> For awhile I thought they were discontinuing this cleanser which has been a natural clean choice throughout the years. Great value for the amount you get. The smell is heavenly and natural - feels great on skin.</li>
    <li> Used this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I have unbelievably sensitive skin. Not delicate skin but if I even think of breaking out I will. I have been using this product for over 3 years and it is perfect. It will absolutly NOT dry out your skin in any way. I never feel that &amp;#34;parched&amp;#34; sensation so common with other cleansers and the algae really does works in this product. It&#x27;s very nourishing. You will not go wrong with this cleanser I promise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about 3 years now and while I&#x27;ve strayed and tried others, this is my tried and true best cleanser. It effectively takes off face makeup without stripping the skin. Works best if you massage your face for a couple of minutes and then thoroughly rinse.</li>
    <li> Zia has long been a high-end line of natural products, and I have become a devotee in the past few years.  I looked long and hard for a good paraben-free cleanser before I found the Zia Basics fresh cleansing gel with sea algae, and I absolutely loved it.  Earlier this year, Zia changed their product line to remove parabens from all the products and base them all on aloe.  I bought the new version and was disappointed to find several new chemical ingredients.  When I used it on my face, it burned my skin.  I have taken it back, and stocked up on the old formula through online suppliers.  I hope Zia comes back around - but until then, I don&#x27;t recommend this product, particularly if your skin is at all sensitive, or you like to avoid alcohols in your facial products like I do.</li>
    <li> Nice, gentle cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t remove make-up well but great for the morning wash. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. Pleasant smell and texture-</li>
    <li> Skin type &#x3D; Rosacea.  Have been using it for years, and it&#x27;s the only cleanser that has not irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin, so this cleanser works well for me.  I had very oily skin/acne as a teenager and into my twenties.  I am currently 41 and have normal skin that can tend to be a bit oily; the Zia products for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin work well for me.  This cleanser feels better on my face than the older version felt (i.e. smoother and silkier).  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I order this regularly as my morning cleanser. It smells so good, not perfume like but from natural oils. It is gentle and instructions suggest you apply and let it sit for a few minutes. I think it would not remove heavy makeup but it works for well for me.</li>
    <li> Strongly recommend buying this item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I met this cleansing gel for the first time at a Whole Foods Market two years ago - it smelled great, all natural, paraben-free and cruelty-free and wanted to try it out. It was the best decision I&#x27;ve made for my skin because it is mild, not oily and won&#x27;t sting my eyes yet works well when I try to remove my eye make-up. I also love the natural and mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price is not very different from offline price, but it saves me a trip to a store. I plan on buying this item from Amazon in the future as well.</li>
    <li> Great product that came quickly!</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and my daughter-in-law has multiple allergies- including lettuce, spinach, citrus, rice. We both have found that the Zia Basic fresh cleansing gel with sea algae helps our skin. My local health store no longer carries it, so I had to go on line to find it and stock up. I tried the new aloe based skin cleanser and tossed it out because it burned my skin.</li>
    <li> very light and easy to wash off, got compliments on my glowing skin! i&#x27;ll stick with this face wash for a while</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t wash my face with anything else.  Get off the makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  If I get a blemish, I dab some on and leave it there for 10 minutes then wash my face.  Seems to sooth my skin irritations.</li>
    <li> This cleans my sensitive skin thoroughly without drying it out. I used to buy it from Whole Foods but they stopped carrying it. I am very happy I have found it again at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and just love it&#x27;s gentle cleansing.  I stopped being able to find it in the stores locally.</li>
    <li> It is so gentle that I can even wash my eyelashes (important, especially if you have dry eyes) without any irritation-no tears. My skin was noticeably softer after the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> Product is as stated, and less expensive than most places.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cleanser! I always come back to it. I have an oily t-zone and have trouble with blackheads. This is the only cleanser I have ever used that actually helps to get rid of them.</li>
    <li> wonderful cleansing gel that restores the moisture balance to my skin while cleaning off oil, makeup, grime, etc. It doesn&#x27;t foam (in case people are expecting that) and has a very neutral reaction with the skin - no weird tingling or anything like that. It does have a little &amp;#34;fresh algae&amp;#34; odor - nothing smelly or marine like. But it&#x27;s obvious the smell isn&#x27;t from perfumes or anything. It&#x27;s the only cleanser that makes my skin feel clean without being tight or dry. I have combination skin (oily t-zone) with occasional adult acne. It&#x27;s very soothing and non irritating.</li>
    <li> Awesome face cleansing gel - we love our Zia Fresh with Sea Algae!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else.  Removes make up, leaves skin clean not dry and not oily.  Just fresh.  The fact that we can&#x27;t purchase it anywhere; not even on Zia&#x27;s website forced me to write directly to them.  I had this on subscribe and save and then it just disappeared.  HELP someone - do you know where I can find some?  Write to Zia if you agree:</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleansing gel I have used.  It&#x27;s gentle and washes off so easily!  My face feels refreshed and new after.</li>
    <li> This cleanser works well with my skin.  I have combination skin and often cleanser either make my skin dry or do not clean well.  This one works great.  I received product in a timely manner. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using Zia Natural products for about 8 years or so and this wash is my favorite. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this cleanser is very calming. It doesn&#x27;t foam up, but it cleans really well getting all the makeup off. I wash my face with it for about a minute and then gently buff it off under water with a micro fiber wash cloth. It works great for me.</li>
