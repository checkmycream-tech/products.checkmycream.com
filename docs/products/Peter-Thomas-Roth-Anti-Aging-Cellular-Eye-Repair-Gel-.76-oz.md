### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>IT IS AWESOME</li>
      <li>Excellent product - hydrates ?</li>
      <li>Peter Thomas Roth is the best skincare line I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>it is wonderful .</li>
      <li>great price!!!</li>
      <li>i love this product !!!</li>
      <li>but for right now, this is great.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE PTR products -</li>
      <li>but this one made my eyes sting, and i could not apply eye make up on top of it.</li>
      <li>My favorite eye cream.  </li>
      <li>i guess its ok, i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
      <li>Tried many eye products that do not deliver their promise</li>
      <li>Its refreshing, soothing and helps smooth wrinkles and reduce puffiness.</li>
      <li>i love it iam 59 years old and honestly people take me for 49 or 50 the most</li>
      <li>I bought this product to help minimize the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s diminished the appearance of fine lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>quick shipment to germany!</li>
      <li>didnt notice much, but it fells good and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>This goes on light but moisturizes.</li>
      <li>cooling great eye open in the morring i have allergys and my eyes are puffy in the am</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2-3 years now and since my eyes aren&#x27;t any more wrinkly than they were than I first started using it in my fifties</li>
      <li>I;ve never had issues with sensitivity using any kind of cosmetics, so I was very surprised to feel my eyes burning after using this gel.</li>
      <li>BTW, it is way more reasonable to buy it on Amazon than places like Sephora and Ulta.  </li>
      <li>I imagine as I get older I will have to go to something more aggressive,</li>
      <li>I liked it enough to purchase a full size.</li>
      <li>My eyes are super sensitive and this eye gel is so light.</li>
      <li>which is great, and you only need to use a tiny bit.  </li>
      <li>Very lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t always use it consistently</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to see if it provides enough moisture for the winter months, but I think it&#x27;s certainly appropriate for spring, summer, and fall.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>I first tried this product when I got a sample from Peter Thomas Roth with another cream I ordered.</li>
      <li>I can really see a difference.</li>
      <li>The line is REALLY pricey</li>
      <li>This eye cream really works.</li>
      <li>I love PTR&#x27;s anti-aging face cleaner and ultra-lite anti-aging face moisturizer, so I also expected to like this eye gel as well.</li>
      <li>It worked very very well on the right eye, and pretty well on the left.  </li>
      <li>I first received this as a sample at the Sephora store near my home, but they have never carried it there</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It really set a high bar for me as far as skin care regimen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even tried a few times just to make sure it wans&#x27;t something else, but no, it&#x27;s the gel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an extremely light-weight, non-greasy cream that does a fantastic job of moisturizing the sensitive eye area.</li>
      <li>Let me be clear -</li>
      <li>My skin is oily, sensitive and blemish prone.  </li>
      <li>so i put this on and it helps them get back to normal</li>
      <li>If I could have purchased it at a physical store near my home, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I had a little laxity under my right eye.</li>
      <li>and when I&#x27;m out of it and using other stuff, I can really tell the difference.  </li>
      <li>Generally I don&#x27;t spend a lot, but I am a big believer in protein peptides after age 50 and this one delivers I think.</li>

<li> This product is keeping that skin firm now after about a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> This goes on light but moisturizes. It&#x27;s diminished the appearance of fine lines under my eyes. Not to say they are gone but they are not as noticeable.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product when I got a sample from Peter Thomas Roth with another cream I ordered. I liked it enough to purchase a full size. It&#x27;s an extremely light-weight, non-greasy cream that does a fantastic job of moisturizing the sensitive eye area. I&#x27;ll have to see if it provides enough moisture for the winter months, but I think it&#x27;s certainly appropriate for spring, summer, and fall.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Have tried almost everything and keep going back to this. Its refreshing, soothing and helps smooth wrinkles and reduce puffiness.</li>
    <li> Let me be clear - I LOVE PTR products - but this one made my eyes sting, and i could not apply eye make up on top of it. For now, I am sticking with PTR unwrinkle eye.</li>
    <li> This eye cream really works. I have been using it now for about a month. I can really see a difference. I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> cooling great eye open in the morring i have allergys and my eyes are puffy in the am so i put this on and it helps them get back to normal</li>
    <li> Excellent product - hydrates ?AND reduces puffiness.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i love this product !!! quick shipment to germany! great price!!!</li>
    <li> I have puffiness under both eyes.  I only use the product at night, but saw noticable reduction in puffiness under both eyes.  It worked very very well on the right eye, and pretty well on the left.  Its a gel so its not greasy which is great, and you only need to use a tiny bit.  I can&#x27;t find this at Sephora anymore and they carry all the Peter Thomas Roth stuff, so I&#x27;m guessing they might be discontinuing this product so get it while you can!  I ordered two, so I should be set for a whle!</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream.  My eyes are super sensitive and this eye gel is so light.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product based on reviews and the name PeterThomasRoth.  Was not fond of the product and I don&#x27;t see me purchasing it again.  I did not see any results.</li>
    <li> I;ve never had issues with sensitivity using any kind of cosmetics, so I was very surprised to feel my eyes burning after using this gel. I&#x27;ve even tried a few times just to make sure it wans&#x27;t something else, but no, it&#x27;s the gel. Even if I don&#x27;t put it too close to the eyes, it will still cause itching and burning. Piece of crap considering Peter Thomas Roth products are usually good.</li>
    <li> I love PTR&#x27;s anti-aging face cleaner and ultra-lite anti-aging face moisturizer, so I also expected to like this eye gel as well. However, I don&#x27;t think that it comes close to working as well as other similarly priced eye moisturizers I have tried. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> i love it iam 59 years old and honestly people take me for 49 or 50 the most I WIIL BE 60 IN A FEW WEEKS SO I WILL TAKE THE TEN YEARS AND THE PRODUCT GOES ON WELL I USE MORNING AND AT NIGHT TRY IT IT IS AWESOME</li>
    <li> didnt notice much, but it fells good and absorbs quickly.  for the price i guess its ok, i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> are confusing. Generally I don&#x27;t spend a lot, but I am a big believer in protein peptides after age 50 and this one delivers I think. I bought this cause I had a little laxity under my right eye. This product is keeping that skin firm now after about a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the gel delivery &#x27;cause for some reason it doesn&#x27;t irritate like creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His prices are also somewhat less than other \\&quot;high end\\&quot; beauty companies.</li>
    <li> This is a cream for under eyes , offer face wash put a little under each eyes and spread around it is wonderful . ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth is the best skincare line I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m 42 and my skin feels like I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s.  The line is REALLY pricey so I don&#x27;t always use it consistently and when I&#x27;m out of it and using other stuff, I can really tell the difference.  BTW, it is way more reasonable to buy it on Amazon than places like Sephora and Ulta.  It really set a high bar for me as far as skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old Black female who wears contacts.  My skin is oily, sensitive and blemish prone.  I bought this product to help minimize the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  After one application,  I can say this product worked for me.  My eyes looked brighter and younger. Also, there was no sensitivity around my eyes.  I would probably order this product again.  My only complaint is I wish it came in at least one ounce for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2-3 years now and since my eyes aren&#x27;t any more wrinkly than they were than I first started using it in my fifties, I guess that&#x27;s a definite plus.  I first received this as a sample at the Sephora store near my home, but they have never carried it there; I can only get it at Sephora online (go figure) or on other sites.  I imagine as I get older I will have to go to something more aggressive, but for right now, this is great.  I use it morning and evening.  I gave it 4 stars.  If I could have purchased it at a physical store near my home, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Can see a visible decrease in lines.Very lightweight and absorbs quickly.Tried many eye products that do not deliver their promise</li>
