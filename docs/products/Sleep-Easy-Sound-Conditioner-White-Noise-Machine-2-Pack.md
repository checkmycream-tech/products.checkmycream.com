      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 and love them!</li>

      <li>Works great and is at the right price.</li>
      <li>Love how u can easily change flow by just turning it...fantastic!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks now and it is great!</li>
      <li>I bought this for my kids rooms and has a nice soothing sound without the fan.</li>
      <li>I work in a suite with many offices.  </li>
      <li>We are satisfied with the quality and performance of this product.</li>
      <li>I used it many years ago, when I had an in-home child care.  </li>
      <li>but I love this product.</li>
      <li>My kids love it</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Even my dogs sleep better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased 2 of these</li>
      <li>Love the noise it makes.</li>
      <li>I dont hear the birds chirping in the morning and sleep way better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never slept better in my life.</li>
      <li>Your kids will sleep so much better with this sound conditioner!</li>
      <li>They sound like many fans and cut out most background noise which come from creaky floors, door openings or just we me and my husband walk around after the kids are in bed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Multiple sound adjustment options (spin the sides + spin the top to modify the noise)&lt;br /&gt;Two-sound levels&lt;br /&gt;Clean (no dust, as of yet)&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly easy to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I moved it into my room and sleeping is easy with this machine.</li>
      <li>The on off button has two settings that adjust the sound level.</li>
      <li>but what if you are the baby that needs the sound of a fan to block street noise or just to create noise because you work nights and need to sleep during the day.</li>
      <li>It is NOT comparable to the Marpac sound machine as others have written in reviews here.</li>
      <li>I put one in our bedroom and one in my kids&#x27; bedroom and everyone sleeps through the night and is well rested and happy the next day!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a sound machine that drowns out noise, this isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
      <li>They have special needs and sleep does not always come easy.  </li>
      <li>easily accessible moving parts for my kids to play with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but now they sleep well for a full 6 to 8 hours.</li>
      <li>Hopefully these hold up because I love them so far!!!</li>
      <li>These were definitely worth the (inexpensive) price and came quickly with my Prime membership shipping.</li>
      <li>I have been dealing with insomnia for awhile,  and granted I&#x27;ve only used this for 2 nights so far, but I slept GREAT both nights.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use, it has several different sound levels and you can change the tone a bit by twisting the top or the sides.</li>
      <li>Replacing old sound conditioner.</li>
      <li>Sleep Easy is placed outside of my door and focus is restored in my therapy sessions.  </li>
      <li>These are okay sound conditioners but they are not loud enough for me.  </li>
      <li>If you live somewhere more rural then these might be all you need.</li>
      <li>I still need two fans, an air conditioner, and two air cleaners to really drown out the noise</li>
      <li>They work very well.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>but I live in a very noisy large city.  </li>
      <li>I had this item years ago when my kids were small to drown out sounds; these are great in winter when you don&#x27;t want to run a fan AND portable enough to travel with...</li>
      <li>I also own a small dog, she no longer hears all the commotion in the halls which used to make her bark.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend them for those who need some white noise to sleep! :)</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this little machine.</li>
      <li>I leave in a noisy apt complex.</li>
      <li>I usually do not review items</li>
      <li>and I use it for my toddler, he sleep through the crying just fine.</li>
      <li>my adult children had sleep issues..</li>
      <li>We were using humidifiers without the water for white noise but realized we were introducing too much dust into their rooms.</li>
      <li>I live in the inner city, in one of the noisiest neighborhoods</li>
      <li>I purchased the 2-pack, one for our bedroom and one for our 8-year old son, who has my same white-noise addiction.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never slept better in my life. I put one in our bedroom and one in my kids&#x27; bedroom and everyone sleeps through the night and is well rested and happy the next day!</li>
    <li> The smell coming from the machine is horrendous. I put the sleep machine in my baby&#x27;s room. He refused to nap, so I went in to check on him. A foul smell permeated the air and everything in the toom, including him, had the foul smell. I take serious issue with this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kids rooms and has a nice soothing sound without the fan. Great to use in the wintertime.</li>
    <li> Good value. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this little machine. It is so easy to use, it has several different sound levels and you can change the tone a bit by twisting the top or the sides. The on off button has two settings that adjust the sound level.I have been dealing with insomnia for awhile,  and granted I&#x27;ve only used this for 2 nights so far, but I slept GREAT both nights. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased 2 of these, I plan to take one of them with me whenever I travel.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, give it a try! Update: I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks now and it is great!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love how u can easily change flow by just turning it...fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have twins and I use it for my toddler, he sleep through the crying just fine.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for our kids rooms.  We bought 2 we were so happy.  Drowns out almost everything and the volume is adjustable.</li>
    <li> These are okay sound conditioners but they are not loud enough for me.  I live in the inner city, in one of the noisiest neighborhoods and I bought 4 of these to drown out my neighbors and my family.  They dampen the noise but they don&#x27;t drown it out.  I still need two fans, an air conditioner, and two air cleaners to really drown out the noise but I live in a very noisy large city.  If you live somewhere more rural then these might be all you need.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Easy sound conditioner works great. No problems at all.  I use it in my office for privacy.</li>
    <li> Just like a dohm but half the price. The dohm is a tad bit louder but isn&#x27;t even noticeable.</li>
    <li> Both of my kids have these and they work wonders. They sound like many fans and cut out most background noise which come from creaky floors, door openings or just we me and my husband walk around after the kids are in bed.</li>
    <li> Replacing old sound conditioner. This one works well and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I usually do not review items but I love this product. I was leery to order but gave it a shot and bought 2 for our trip. We sleep with fans and this has replaced the need for fans for us to sleep. My kids love it and I set them to low on both. The are louder than I thought which us great! I&#x27;ve bought a white noise machine before and returned it because it was not loud enough! Hopefully these hold up because I love them so far!!!</li>
    <li> Love the noise it makes. soothing and great to sleep to. Finally got rid of our box fans!</li>
    <li> Perfect product for sleeping babies! Your kids will sleep so much better with this sound conditioner! It has a multitude of settings for any room and is simple, yet affective for any noisy environment. I bought 2 and love them! Must buy for anybody!</li>
    <li> best on the market for the price!</li>
    <li> It makes noise but that&#x27;s all I can say. If you&#x27;re looking for a sound machine that drowns out noise, this isn&#x27;t the one for you. It is NOT comparable to the Marpac sound machine as others have written in reviews here. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I had this item years ago when my kids were small to drown out sounds; these are great in winter when you don&#x27;t want to run a fan AND portable enough to travel with... Now they help drown out unwanted noises like snoring as well!!</li>
    <li> Works Great! I dont hear the birds chirping in the morning and sleep way better</li>
    <li> Works great and is at the right price.</li>
    <li> We bought two of these to replace dusty fans in our kids&#x27; bedrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple sound adjustment options (spin the sides + spin the top to modify the noise)&lt;br /&gt;Two-sound levels&lt;br /&gt;Clean (no dust, as of yet)&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;No easily accessible moving parts for my kids to play with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;The fans are definitely louder than these, and that led to a couple adjustment nights for our kids. I wish these were slightly louder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t done a power consumption test, but I can&#x27;t imagine they don&#x27;t use a little less power than the fans, as</li>
    <li> Even my dogs sleep better.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I used it many years ago, when I had an in-home child care.  It made it easier for the little ones to take their naps.  Now I use it in each of my grown boys bedrooms.  They have special needs and sleep does not always come easy.  Since we started using the &amp;#34;Sleep Easy&amp;#34; it seems that the boys get a sounder sleep.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We are satisfied with the quality and performance of this product.</li>
    <li> I work in a suite with many offices.  Noise emits from neighboring offices and hallway conversations. Sleep Easy is placed outside of my door and focus is restored in my therapy sessions.  Dr. P.</li>
    <li> We were using humidifiers without the water for white noise but realized we were introducing too much dust into their rooms. We use these with our girls. Each of them set it to their liking. I can see this being a permanent part for their sleep for years to come.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and work just as well as DOHM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who simply needs some white noise (no music, no television) to fall asleep. We recently renovated and took out the overhead fan in our bedroom, and boy was I missing it! Every little creak in our old colonial was keeping me awake, never mind the sounds of my hubby, two dogs, cat, and three kids throughout the night and morning! So I did some searching and came across this device. I purchased the 2-pack, one for our bedroom and one for our 8-year old son, who has my same white-noise addiction. They came in yesterday, and....we LOVE them!!! They&#x27;re just perfect!!! They provide the perfect background noise and the level of sound can be controlled with the push of a button or the twist of the wrist. These were definitely worth the (inexpensive) price and came quickly with my Prime membership shipping. I definitely recommend them for those who need some white noise to sleep! :)</li>
    <li> I leave in a noisy apt complex. These white noise machines help drown out hallway noise. I also own a small dog, she no longer hears all the commotion in the halls which used to make her bark. You can adjust the volume of the device very easily. Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t an effective product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Yes...these will create wonderful background noise to help your baby sleep. ..but what if you are the baby that needs the sound of a fan to block street noise or just to create noise because you work nights and need to sleep during the day. .thats me...I had good luck with this unit with my grandkids so I moved it into my room and sleeping is easy with this machine. .I recommend it. .only if you want to sleep. .&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...3-3-2016...I now have purchased 4...my adult children had sleep issues..but now they sleep well for a full 6 to 8 hours.</li>
    <li> We use these  to provide privacy (white noise) in our small office.  They work very well.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised for a great price</li>
