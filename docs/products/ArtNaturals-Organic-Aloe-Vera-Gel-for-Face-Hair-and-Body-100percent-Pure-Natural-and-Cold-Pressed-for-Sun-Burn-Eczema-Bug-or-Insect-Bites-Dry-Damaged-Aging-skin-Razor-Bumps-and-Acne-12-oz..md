<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to rashes and redness. I also have eczema and I end up scratching these places until they bleed. I’ve been an avid user of Aloe Vera Gel for a long time now, and this particular Aloe Vera Gel by ArtNaturals is 100% Pure and Natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Gel has had a clear effect in giving me the relief I need. I use Aloe Vera for many skin conditions, such as rashes, sunburns, bug bites, eczema, dry skin, and minor burns. It’s even better if you keep the aloe vera gel in the refrigerator so when you use it, it will give additional relief to your distressed skin. I also go further and have used aloe vera gel to treat under-eye puffiness and dark eye circles. It seriously works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle of ArtNaturals Aloe Vera Gel is a very generous volume size for the price. It also comes with a hygienic pump so you don’t have to pour or dip your fingers into the bottle. I highly recommend this product for its many uses and benefits, and have already converted a bunch of my friends and family to become Aloe Vera gel believes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for testing and review.</li>
    <li> I like it. I see the improvement in my sun damaged dry skin, no skin irritation after applying. I will continue using this. Lucky, I bought this item for very discounted price. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> ArtNaturals Aloe Vera Gel is better than Hydrocortisone Cream for stopping itching from bug bites and other itches like grass irritation.  I tried this brand as it was recommended to relieve itching.  I&#x27;m allergic to everything and was extremely surprised when it relieved the problems faster than I ever dreamed possible.  When I use hydrocortisone cream, I usually have to reapply the cream several times.  One application of the ArtNaturals Aloe Vera Gel is all it takes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ArtNaturals Aloe Vera Gel for Face, Hair &amp; Body Works great.  There are so many uses for Aloe Vera.  This is a great product to make sure you never run out of. This is great for your skin.  I have dry patches on my face.  But, my face is always oily.  The aloe vera balances it out. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. I don&#x27;t have to worry about my face looking greasy after using this. I love that this product is 100% pure &amp; natural. They also included a pump for easy dispensing. Great product</li>
    <li> Received this bottle of Aloe Vera Gel quickly. Packing and pump are great. The gel does not have an odor and is not sticky like some aloe gels. The product is labeled as 100% aloe vera but, if you look at the ingredients listed on the back it is 99.75% pure and has preservative. Will use in many of my homemade health and beauty recipes with a little more caution.</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER:  I received a product discount for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 51, and for the time in my life, I am suffering from dry skin. I am always looking for something to help with the dryness, without being heavy or leaving a residue. That is why I love using ArtNaturals Ale Vera Gel, it quickly rehydrates my skin, without a sticky residue.  It has little to no scent, which is great, because I can be sensitive to scented products. (It varies by product and whether my allergies are acting up). My hands and arms, immediately feel better after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light gel feel to it, that is neither thick nor heavy. The gel is easy to apply, spreads easy, and soaks in quickly. My skin looks less dry and feels soft and silky after application.</li>
    <li> This may be an odd note to start on, but the first thing I noticed about this aloe gel was that it SMELLS better than past aloe products I&#x27;ve bought. It doesn&#x27;t smell old or overly sweet, but kind of light and green, if that makes sense. I&#x27;m also really pleased with how little has been added to it, only a thickener for skin application, and a few preservatives to prevent bacterial growth; otherwise, it&#x27;s pure aloe vera! I got this at a steep discount through snagshout, but I&#x27;m very willing to give it a go a second time around even without the snagshout price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this Aloe Vera Gel. Not only because it was made in the USA which is wonderful, but it seriously is amazing. This came in a plastic bag sealed and with it came a pump. It was packaged great. No leakage what so ever. But the Aloe had a nice clean smell, I loved how it made my skin feel after a shower. I used it for all my children. One had poison ivy and I dabbed some of it on her and she felt at ease soon after applied. Another had some insect bites from playing outside and another had a bit of a sun burn on her cheeks. They all felt better after the first application and 100 times better after the second. I would highly recommend this Aloe Vera Gel over any store bought one I have.&lt;br /&gt;-I did receive this product free and in return to give honest opinion. This review above is all my own words.</li>
    <li> This Aloe Vera Gel has permanently changed my way of thinking. Growing up Aloe Vera was used when we were sun burned. It was sticky and smelled funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not any more! ArtNaturals offers a 100% pure and natural Aloe Vera Gel that is clear, almost scent free and woohoo... not sticky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the product information, this is made from organic ingredients and can be used to sooth any number of complaints including sunburns, heat rash, chapped skin from windburn, insect bites and stings, and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clear and thin so it can be rubbed in quickly and completely. There is a slight scent to it, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant and overpowering. The gel absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or tacky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have placed my bottle near the hand sink so that I can remember to take a little dab and apply it to my hands and arms a couple of times a day. I like that I can&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it once it absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with the product and it was an issue with the bottling not product itself. The bottle is so full that when you place the pump top on the bottle and tighten it down, a good amount of product is displaced. I would suggest that you use the product a couple of times by pouring it into your hands. This will prevent the mess and waste. Other that this small point, the product is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, this has changed the way I think of Aloe Vera! If you have dry skin issues or your little ones get that daily pink on their noses and shoulders; this gel will provide comfort as well as moisture to the affected areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I love Aloe and this comes in a bottle with a pump. Exceptional buy. I received for a review</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find a good pure shelf stable around where I live, so I was very excited to get the opportunity to get this bottle just for testing it and sharing my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe has so many uses. Since I received this bottle I made a natural hand sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;15 drops of tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;5 drops of lavender oil&lt;br /&gt;4 oz aloe&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp witchazel&lt;br /&gt;I capsule vitamin e&lt;br /&gt;Super easy and natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it on my scalp and hair. When the weather changes my head can get dry. This soothes it and softens my hair and cuts frizz from the humidity. I just rub it on and leave it in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it to help with the redness on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to make a lotion with it too. Aloe is very moisturizing and easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle has pretty given very useful!</li>
    <li> great to have at home. Great for sunburn. no after smell</li>
    <li> Free. This aloe vera works wonders. My 4 year old toddler got a pretty bad sunburn at the beach. I applied this aloe and she had immediate relief, and didnt even peel.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE QUALITY FEELS COOL AND FRESH, WOULD RECOMMED FOR SUN BURN.</li>
    <li> I love to use aloe on the kids and myself for scratches and skin irritations. This gel is perfect! Also wonderful for sunburn! The convenient pump makes it super easy to use! No mess! It is so cool soothing when it touches your skin! Love it! Highly recommend! I received a free product for my review of this item. The review is my own.</li>
    <li> wow really like this aloe very gel, I used it in my hair and it made it so soft it also helped just a little to hold my hair in place received this product for a honest and helpful review</li>
    <li> I just received this product and it came very fast. I love that it is straight aloe, without all the extra add in&#x27;s. It is a good size bottle. I know this will last a long time, since only a little is needed for each use. I mainly purchased this product for my husband and daughter. They both have eczema. It doesn&#x27;t burn while applying like some of the other products. I also bought this product because, who wouldn&#x27;t keep it in the medicine cabinet for the &amp;#34;What If&#x27;s&amp;#34;, such as sunburns,razor burns, stings, poison ivy etc. It has a mild smell, so it can&#x27;t be smelt on you from a distance away. It&#x27;s also nice to have a pump for it. It&#x27;s nice that I am not getting to much at one time and wasting it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this! This product is all natural, no additives. The smell is great and it comes with both options as a squeeze bottle or a pump top. After reading all of the things you can use aloe vera for I was using this for everything. There are several home remedies and this product works great for all of them.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I started buying this for my kids to use to help their acne.  A family member in Italy told us that the teenagers there use a medical grade aloe - which you can buy at a pharmacy over there.  It appeared to be working, however, when we ran out, I did not want to have to ship aloe from Italy.  I found this product and hoped it would work.  It appears to be the same consistency as the aloe we purchased over there - not slimy and thick like aloe of old, but rather, soft and a bit thinner.  It applies nicely and does not leave your skin sticky, but rather soft and hydrated.  While it does not make the acne disappear, it definitely helps make it less red and painful and clearing many of the breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an aloe vera gel before so I&#x27;m not really sure about what I should be expecting. However, reading about other people&#x27;s reviews, I think it&#x27;s supposed to be a thicker consistency? I&#x27;m going through radiation right now for breast cancer and I got this to help with the burning. I DO feel a slight cooling effect. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the consistency though. It&#x27;s too liquidy, somewhat sticky, and has this very very slight smell (this one doesn&#x27;t really bother me much). I haven&#x27;t had the later side effects of the burning and skin peeling so I&#x27;ll update if it helps with that.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few products from artnaturals and have enjoyed every one. So when I got a chance get the Aloe Vera Gel from them I did not hesitate to get it .

I put mine in the fridge even before I even opened up mine up for a extra cool feeling when applying this . This is made in the USA and is 100% aloe vera.  This  def does a great job and will help with whatever you need it for .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about it. It doesn&#x27;t hold and it&#x27;s not in a gel form, All liquid. :-(</li>
    <li> This is a Natural product that is free from color and perfumes no additives too..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its clear and cold to feel but its non greasy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easily absorbed by the skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like it coz its a natural remedy for sunburn of itchiness of skin due to dry flaky condition of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it with my SPF lotion to make it more smooth to apply :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: perform a skin test first to check if your allergic..&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t use it in your face not unless you wished too..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all iam satisfied, i just hope they make a price a litlle bit less</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Pleasant smell and good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;- A nice and professional looking bottle.&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely helps to sooth dry or irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- It has a very watery consistency, I didn&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;- Sort of comes exploding out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Summary:&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I could really compare this to would probably be along the lines of Solarcaine. I don&#x27;t think it numbs the effected area as much as Solarcaine does, but minus the numbing aspect, it definitely does help mitigate a sunburn. I have a blood and skin cancer that creates these large dry patches of skin all over me and this product absolutely helps to soothe the dry areas and seems to moisturize nicely as well.</li>
    <li> Aloe Gel is always good for dry and sensitive skin. The product is honest and explicitly says there are minimum preservative added, so not 100% aloe gel. I like the way it makes this clear. Mine came with an expiration date of July 2018, which is not bad at all. I applied to my dry skin and it feels cold and smooth. Like it a lot. Thanks for offering this with a deep discount!</li>
    <li> It just arrived and perfect timing as I have a very bad burn on the top of my hand.  It felt very good going on no smell good texture says made in USA.  I received a discount to review honestly and since I was in need I&#x27;m very happy to have this high quality product to use</li>
    <li> Love it! Made my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> This Aloe gel is the best! It arrived the other day and i had the perfect opportunity to use it! I got a cut on my hand it it itched like crazy and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to help. So I used the aloe vera gel and it has worked like magic! Living in a desert I have purchased my share of aloe vera gels before, but this is the best I have used. Its not sticky and goes on smoothly, and best part is its all natural!  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great aloe product.&lt;br /&gt;*disclaimer item was purchased at a low cost amount in return for a honest non biased review</li>
    <li> My aloe vera gel arrive today and I already love it.  Opened it right away to get a sniff and it smells heavenly.  It&#x27;s all natural with nothing added, so the scent is nicely fresh. I am also impressed with the size of the container.  I got it at a very special promotion, but would easily purchase it at full price in the future.  Will be using this a lot and recommending it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Art naturals Aloe Vera Gel, 100% pure and natural was given to me for free.  I have used it on several reasons burns cooking in my kitchen to a nice sunburn on my neck and far be issue I forgot to apply sunscreen.  It relieved the pain of the pain and help to soothe the burns, while aiding in the healing process.  This is going to become a staple in my house.</li>
    <li> This is not a gel, it&#x27;s like a liquid. Sticky after application. I&#x27;m going to return to my Aloe Vera Gelly-99% Lily Of The Desert 12 oz Gel which is nice and thick and not sticky. I purchased this because I liked the idea of a pump which it came with.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my hair and face. Shipping is quick. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This is one of the most natural aloe vera gels that I can find on the market. My skin is super sensitive to chemicals and I try to stick to as natural as possible with skincare products. I mix equal amounts of ArtNaturals organic jojoba oil and organic aloe vera gel as a moisturizer. My skin has been so smooth and it even prevents future breakouts. Also, the bottle was way bigger than I expected so thats a plus. I really enjoy the pump that was included. I will buy this product again in the future.  THANK YOU ArtNaturals.</li>
    <li> I work in a restaurant and get burned often. I love keeping a bottle of aloe handy to help soothe burns and bug bites. My mother always used to keep an aloe plant in our kitchen window sill but I&#x27;ve never been able to keep one alive, even as hard to kill as they are. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that this gel is not sticky like straight aloe from the plant. It is much thinner too. I like that because a little goes a long way and will help this bottle last much longer. I also like that it is 100% natural ingredients and mostly all aloe. There is also Citric Acid, Vitamin C, Potassium Sorbate, and Xanthan which are all natural products as well. I did not know that aloe would help to heal dry cracked skin and am anxious to see how well it will help my heels.The pump style dispenser is perfect for easy application and it also has a screw on cap for easy, spill proof storage or traveling.I did receive my bottle free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after trying it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product originally as an after sun-burn care product. However, after it arrived I researched and found it had many more benefits than burn healing! I have very sensitive skin and at the moment a little acne on my chin area. One spot turned into a sore. At night, after washing my face I would place a little dab of this baby onto the sore and within a week it is near gone - healed completely up! Just be careful to only place it on the sore itself, not the entire face - because it will make your skin break out even more if you have sensitive skin like me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can use more natural products for both skin care and first aid and this product is definitely a jack of trades, must have in your bathroom cabinet kind of bottle! Use it for sunburn treatment, to treat acne prone skin, fight eczema, moisturize skin or one of its many, many other benefits!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on itching and sunburn</li>
    <li> Love this!  My son got really bad burned after applying this he was in much relief from the pain. Awesome!!! Received for free with a code</li>
    <li> I love Aloe Vera Gel as a part of my beauty regimen ( Hair and Skin), the only compliant that I have is that the consistency of this Aloe is not Gel as it is stated on the bottle but more like water.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and very easy to use. Like that it is all natural no harmful chemical. Great buy.</li>
    <li> ArtNaturals Aloe Vera Gel is all natural, 100% aloe, alcohol free, and odor free.  This stuff is great!  Aloe is very healing; especially when it is in its natural form.  This is as close as you are going to get to the natural form without buying the plant and growing it yourself.  A little bit goes a long way.  The pump that comes with it is a little tough to push down, but that helps control how much actually comes out since you don&#x27;t want to waste this product.  We have used this several times already and love it.  Much better than that store bought aloe you get for burns.</li>
    <li> The thing about Aloe Vera Gel is that it&#x27;s either pure, or it&#x27;s not. Most of the stuff you buy that say Aloe Vera Gel is a blend with other items like glycerine. What I wanted was what my mother used to get out of the plant she had in her bedroom, not Aloe mix. And I found it with ArtNaturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the good stuff. Not just because they claim it is, but my own experience. I am apparently a mosquito magnet, and pure Aloe gives me relief when nothing else works. Even on fresh bites, this worked great, as only the good stuff does. Ditto with my sunburn. So to me, at least, this is truly pure. A little goes a long way, too, so this big bottle will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and refreshed skin are my own.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free for my review. This products feel is just like if you would go break off a aloe plant leaf and get the inside out. I was very grateful to have gotten this product to try as I got sun burnt this weekend. This product helped calm the pain and made my skin so soft. I also liking aloe after I get out of a bath because I get very dry skin. This product worked just as it said. It did not leave and stick residue as some that I have used in the past. This product is also the right consistency that it is supposed to be. There are some on the market that are either way to thick or way to watered down. Because this is a 100% aloe product I would say make for sure before using over a large area. I have been using straight from the plant from years so i knew that I could use this. This is a great for sure buy and this will become part of our family.</li>
    <li> I did receive this product for free.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that this product was pure aloe. I liked the packaging and the dispenser so you don&#x27;t have to squeeze a bottle to get the aloe out and is very handy if you get a burn. The product itself was great. It was just like going outside and getting aloe from the actual plant outside not some strange looking gel that you normally get. I love the fact that this product is made in the USA. I would definitely purchase this product in the future. I think the only thing that I did not care for was that right after applying it seems a little sticky, this does go away quickly as soon as it dries and is absorbed into the skin. It did not feel heavy on the skin in fact it feels very light and airy.</li>
    <li> Very soothing on dry cracked skin, and sunburns. I used this on my husband after he got a bad burn a few days ago, and it was calming for his skin. I received this on discount for review but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I recived this product sole purpose of review I use to shave legs much better than anything else</li>
    <li> I have finally found what I am looking for!! This Aloe Vera Gel is fantastic! I have purchased a few different kinds to find one that works for my needs. This is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Aloe Vera for many things. My main use is for sunburns but it is really much, much more. Dry skin, scratches, razor burn, eczema and more! I purchased this bottle to use with my my essential oils. Essential oils that are applied to the skin need to be diluted. Usually a carrier oil is used. I find most oils too greasy wanted another option . Some recipes call for Aloe Vera so I decided to give it a try. I used 3 drops of oil to about 5 ml of Aloe Vera. Make sure you look up a dilution chart to figure out how much oil you should add. (it depends on the age of the person using it and the type of oil). I mixed a synergy of oils to help increase energy with my Aloe Vera gel and used it as you would use a lotion (applying to arms and legs). The gel does not leave a sticky or greasy feel and the smell of the oils are not overpowered by the natural smell of the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Do you want to bring more natural products into your home? Need a natural bug repellent, face toner, lotion, sleep aid, acne wash? Use this product with a pure grade essential oil to help get your family away from harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked. I am glad that I finally found a great natural Aloe Vera Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found anything helpful in my review please hit &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; to &#x27;is this review helpful?&#x27;. I enjoy sharing what I have learned and giving my honest opinion about the items I receive from Amazon. Thank you!</li>
    <li> One of the main attractions of this product is that you do not  have to refrigerate it! I typically have used Lily of the Dessert Aloe Vera Juice/Gel for my hair and it has to be refrigerated. I don&#x27;t particularly like having to store my hair products with my food, so I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another main attraction is the hand pump that is included with the product. I&#x27;m not a big fan of scooping product out with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dense, naturally curly African-American textured hair, so this gel only provided moisture and not hold. However, I mixed it with EcoStyler gel and castor oil to create a custard. The aloe gel lessened the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; of the Ecostyler and the combo provided the perfect hold for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy this again for the convenient packaging and because it works as an addition to my haircare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I purchased this product as part of a promotion. This review is my honest and unbiased opinion. I was not paid to receive or endorse this product.</li>
    <li> a wonderful natural feeling lotion.  I have used it as a moisturizer on my face, legs arms all over!  I also tried it on my hair and was pleasantly surprised how it didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or dirty looking.  I had a friend yesterday tell me how healthy my hair looked and I directly attribute it to the Art Natural salon Vera Gel!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I love the pump that came with this and it feels so good on my sunburn!</li>
    <li> The day I received this I got a sunburn so I had my husband put it on it.  I left it on a few hours, took a shower, and now my sunburn is gone.  It works great for sunburns.  My husband has heat rash and I want to see if it will work on there too.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product on a discount/promo price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many aloe vera products and for me ArtNaturals makes the best. I love the pump action cap that dispenses just the right amount every time. I&#x27;m always looking for products that at 100% pure and natural. It gives me a good feeling that it is grown and made in the USA. I like it best when I can talk my husband into rubbing it on my feet after a hard day at the office. I also like to use the Aloe Vera as a Base to add my other oils to, to give it a more perfume smell.  I received product for free for my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product couldn&#x27;t be more natural. I love the runny texture, which is great for burns and scrapes. Even for dry skin. I love that it comes with a free pump, as well. Recommended product.</li>
    <li> I received this ArtNaturals Aloe complimentary to test and review. It was good timing as I went to the &amp;#34;Woodward Dream Cruise&amp;#34; and forgot to put on sunscreen, ouchy! The first thing I noticed when I dispensed the gel is that &amp;#34;whoa&amp;#34; it is not green but clear. I decided to read the label and compared it to the drugstore aloe I had and wow, I could actually understand the ingredients for the ArtNaturals in comparison to the drugstore brand. So what makes it different? I have a photo of my shoulder but it probably doesn&#x27;t tell much in the visual. My main complaint about aloe is that it is sticky long after you put it on and the thing I noticed first is that ArtNaturals aloe absorbs completely no stickiness just nice hydrated skin! It really did feel different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has changed the way I look at skin care, now I will buy a lidocaine spray to help sunburn and use this aloe instead of watered down dye infested drugstore aloe! The price per bottle is comparable to most brands so this is a good deal to me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my entire body after showering. My skin hasn&#x27;t been so dry and people have been asking me what do I use. I also put it in my hair,I applied it to my scalp and my hair has life now. Doesn&#x27;t look dull and brittle. I will continue to use it especially since my face hasn&#x27;t broken out day 4. I am glad I decided to review this product for a very small fee. Aloe vera plants heal and soothe cuts, and everything. Take the memory of scars out</li>
    <li> For years my mother has used this stuff and now I use it for all my skin problems.  My dog has allergies and chews on her legs quite a bit. I apply some on a damp cloth and clean her legs when she comes in from being outside. Her fur is starting to grow back now.</li>
    <li> Love it a little sticky until it dries</li>
    <li> I like it!its helpful for dry face!</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase after going through reviews. I am totally in love with it. The oil is so thin, not smelly.. love to massage my Face, feet with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely give a try.</li>
