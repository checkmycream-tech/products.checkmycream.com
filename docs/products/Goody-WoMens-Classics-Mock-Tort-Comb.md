      <li>It&#x27;s very flexible not ridged so holds hair great.</li>
      <li>2 more words</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to be able to find this size side combs.  </li>
      <li>They can&#x27;t be found in stores anymore, They hold the hair in place even when it&#x27;s soft and fly away.</li>
      <li>Also, they are flexible and don&#x27;t break easily.  </li>
      <li>The plastic has no give and these break easily.</li>
      <li>Teeth are not strong--and break off easily.  </li>
      <li>so I ordered more and so far so good.  </li>
      <li>They are nice and large and I can&#x27;t find them in the stores.</li>
      <li>These combs are a bit wider than most, and very flexible.</li>
      <li>I absolutely will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I was glad everything was as described, thank you so much.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin, but I have a good amount of it and these combs are easy to push through my hair (that&#x27;s the best feature) and they hold all day long.</li>
      <li>Mega super brittle and flimsy....not at all flexible.</li>
      <li>My order was quickly corrected and mailed.  </li>
      <li>Very flimsy plastic...breaks easily</li>
      <li>The tortoise shell pattern is a classic and looks nice in pretty much every hair color as well.</li>
      <li>They are good for keeping the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; smoothed down.  </li>
      <li>When I first ordered these combs</li>
      <li>EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.</li>
      <li>Exactly as I was looking for and as shown and advertised.</li>
      <li>Too flexible for my taste, because they don&#x27;t hold as well as more rigid ones, and are harder to put in.</li>
      <li>This is not the seller&#x27;s fault but that of Goody for making such a cheap product</li>
      <li>They did exactly what I bought them for, but as a 4c natural I didn&#x27;t get quite the hold I needed.</li>
      <li>For some odd reason you can not find this size in stores any more</li>
      <li>Great little comb, its thin  but strong.</li>
      <li>Wish Goody would put more combs out in colors or a little decoration.  </li>
      <li>&#x60;The only side combs worth buying.</li>
      <li>These are the only combs I can use in my baby-fine hair to hold it back securely.</li>
      <li>I was sent the clear combs rather than the mock tortoise color.  </li>
      <li>I have thin hair which is straight on top near my part, but then gets wavy.</li>
      <li>There are a bit soft.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, they are pretty cheaply made, so they break after a short period of time.</li>

<li> If they were heavy duty , I would give them 5 stars !!!</li>
<li> One of the prongs have already broken and I have thin hair.</li>
<li> The quality of these side combs is awful flimsey compared to the one set I have left from over 20 years ago.</li>
<li> These are impossible to find anywhere else.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These combs are a bit wider than most, and very flexible. Too flexible for my taste, because they don&#x27;t hold as well as more rigid ones, and are harder to put in. I just found a pack of 5 pairs of combs, each pair in a slightly different color, by Scunci at Walgreens, for the same $4.99, and I use these Scunci combs now in preference to the ones by Goody.</li>
    <li> These are almost the same combs I bought at WalMart some years ago.  They&#x27;re a little flimsier but still do the job.  It&#x27;s a shame you have to buy these online now.  Wish Goody would put more combs out in colors or a little decoration.  Above all else, start putting back in the stores.</li>
    <li> I love the size, but I wish the plastic were a bit stiffer.</li>
    <li> These are the best combs on the market I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried at least 6 different brands. I have thin hair which is straight on top near my part, but then gets wavy. My hair is thin, but I have a good amount of it and these combs are easy to push through my hair (that&#x27;s the best feature) and they hold all day long. Also, they are flexible and don&#x27;t break easily.  I will probably buy another package just to have them because I have never found them in a store.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these combs.</li>
    <li> Some of the end teeth broke on these combs so I ordered more and so far so good.  They are nice and large and I can&#x27;t find them in the stores.</li>
    <li> Mega super brittle and flimsy....not at all flexible. Broke one just trying to open the package which is not easy to open. This is not the seller&#x27;s fault but that of Goody for making such a cheap product</li>
    <li> These combs are the excact size I have been looking for. Goody used to carry these size side combs in stores , but I have never found them any where . The quality of these side combs is awful flimsey compared to the one set I have left from over 20 years ago. If they were heavy duty , I would give them 5 stars !!!</li>
    <li> They did exactly what I bought them for, but as a 4c natural I didn&#x27;t get quite the hold I needed. There are a bit soft.  I may have to try again on wet hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to be able to find this size side combs.  Some people mentioned that they weren&#x27;t sturdy.  They are flexible not rock hard, but that is the way I like my combs.  I like them and hope I can continue to purchase them on ebay.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these anyplace else.  Exactly as I was looking for and as shown and advertised.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent side comb.  It holds in hair of various types.  The tortoise shell pattern is a classic and looks nice in pretty much every hair color as well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hold my hair at all.</li>
    <li> One of the prongs have already broken and I have thin hair.</li>
    <li> Goody used to put out quality products. The combs are flimsy, also, they are slightly smaller than they were just a few years ago, small enough to notice.</li>
    <li> These are impossible to find anywhere else.  I love them and I&#x27;m so glad I found them here. 2 more words</li>
    <li> I broke it. Was it me or the product? I don&#x27;t know . Your guess is as good as mine. All I know is that I no longer have this item.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered these combs I was sent the clear combs rather than the mock tortoise color.  My order was quickly corrected and mailed.  Thank you! -</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these in the store anymore.  I always used to get them at Walmart but they no longer carry them.  They keep my hair in place the best and are somewhat flexible.</li>
    <li> &#x60;The only side combs worth buying. They can&#x27;t be found in stores anymore, They hold the hair in place even when it&#x27;s soft and fly away.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find these combs on here.  They are the only brand and type that will handle my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy plastic...breaks easily</li>
    <li> I have been wearing these on the sides when I wear a pony tail.  They are good for keeping the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; smoothed down.  Couldn&#x27;t find this size at any local stores.</li>
    <li> These are the only combs I can use in my baby-fine hair to hold it back securely. Unfortunately, they are pretty cheaply made, so they break after a short period of time. Don&#x27;t use them on wet hair or they will break immediately.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, great purchase!</li>
    <li> I had used side combs for years---but they finally gave out, so I ordered these.  Teeth are not strong--and break off easily.  I ordered two sets in February--already threw out one set and refuse to use the other.  Very cheaply made! Teeth just break off and I do not have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I was glad everything was as described, thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Great little comb, its thin  but strong. It&#x27;s very flexible not ridged so holds hair great. Can&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore so I was happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> Love these combs! For some odd reason you can not find this size in stores any more and I&#x27;m so happy I could order them. Goody has great product and I&#x27;ve used their product for years. I only wish you could buy locally in stores. I absolutely will be ordering more. Their prices and speedy shipping are a plus!!</li>
    <li> The plastic has no give and these break easily.</li>
