      <li>I love them and can&#x27;t wait to grow my nails out some for space to use them!</li>
      <li>These arrived about 2 weeks after I placed the order, which was a nice surprise.  </li>
      <li>They are still nice studs, just not what I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>They also came nicely packaged and came which gold and silver studs as stated.</li>
      <li>but they look pretty on my nails :) The size is perfect!</li>
      <li>Got these to try them out and ended up loving them so much!!!!</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a set of tweezers to put these on.</li>
      <li>But Ebay has them cheeper for a lot more pieces.</li>
      <li>I love these studs.</li>
      <li>but they still look so cute.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I tried to apply them with a top coat, and that didn&#x27;t work as well as nail glue.</li>
      <li>Easy to make crosses on nails.</li>
      <li>They stay on easily with glue.  </li>
      <li>These dissapointed me when they didn&#x27;t come in a nail wheel, however they are super cute</li>
      <li>easy to work with, fun to look at :)</li>
      <li>that was a huge plus.</li>
      <li>The 4mm are perfect size for small nails.</li>
      <li>Perfect for even small nail beds.</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>The studs are just to big for nails they don&#x27;t look good on.</li>
      <li>and it came pretty quick too....!</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, they look awesome and last as long as you want your manicure to!</li>
      <li>Next time i&#x27;ll have to be more selective when buying things.</li>
      <li>These are so pretty.</li>
      <li>However, they aren&#x27;t exactly as pictured.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really pretty</li>
      <li>these are sure to last me a while ^-^</li>
      <li>They are too flat as-is for my curved nails, but they can be easily bent with some pliers.  </li>
      <li>I expected :)</li>
      <li>The top coat will just bubble up underneath the stud, and not really attach to your nail.</li>
      <li>Not much to say, but they took about a week or more to arrive &amp; on the picture they look square, but when I got them they all were triangle.</li>
      <li>They look really neat on my nails.</li>
      <li>It was what I expected, love these for my nail art.</li>
      <li>You may want to use these with some length to your nail, but the square design is really posh.</li>
      <li>looks several times and they always stay securely in place</li>
      <li>These do not fit nicely on the nail at all.</li>
      <li>Got my order in and was excited to open the package, once i opened it</li>
      <li>I had a little bit of a hard time attaching them, but otherwise they are great!</li>
      <li>I also really like the fact that this product includes both silver and gold studs, as most studs only come in one single color.</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to maneuver</li>
      <li>I however have normal sized nails</li>
      <li>But there pretty big.</li>
      <li>These studs are easy to work with and flat on the bottom which makes them stick on the nail without any sharp edges of high ridges.  </li>

    <li> A little larger than I expected.</li>
    <li> either i have to bend them to my nail shape or something. they dont lie flat on my nails like i thought they might....</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick. I used that same day. Perfect for nails. Stay on a long time. Easy to make crosses on nails. Gold and silver.</li>
    <li> So I have no idea why it says you can use them for nails!! A lot of my clients want these put on their nails. But there pretty big. Plus. It cannot go on a curved nail because its flat.</li>
    <li> perfect thing to top off your manicure with.  Howeer you may need tweezers to apply them.  They stay on easily with glue.  Arrived in about 2 1/2 weeks in good condition.</li>
    <li> it was more like 20 each and the way they were sent horrible!! they were nice but wouldn&#x27;t be getting them again!! waste of money.</li>
    <li> In the picture, it shows gold and silver square nail art studs. I received gold and silver triangle studs. The only reason I gave a 2 star rating was because they came earlier than I expected. I didn&#x27;t count the pieces but I didn&#x27;t seem like there were 270 there.</li>
    <li> These arrived about 2 weeks after I placed the order, which was a nice surprise.  However, they aren&#x27;t exactly as pictured.  Instead of being a pyramid shape, the studs I received were flat squares with bevelled edges.  They are still nice studs, just not what I was expecting.  They are too flat as-is for my curved nails, but they can be easily bent with some pliers.  I would give them 5 stars if they looked like the picture</li>
    <li> Not much to say, but they took about a week or more to arrive &amp; on the picture they look square, but when I got them they all were triangle. Not so satisfy &amp; definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> You may want to use these with some length to your nail, but the square design is really posh. I love them and can&#x27;t wait to grow my nails out some for space to use them!</li>
    <li> These studs are great! They&#x27;re harder to apply, they stick together (back to back) in the bag, so you need to use tweezers.

    <li> It was what I expected, love these for my nail art. Great product. To a little long to arrive .</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Make sure you use good glue!</li>
    <li> With DIY nail art getting so popular these days, studs are a must have for nail art enthusiasts!  These studs are easy to work with and flat on the bottom which makes them stick on the nail without any sharp edges of high ridges.  I&#x27;ve incorporated these studs into my nail art looks several times and they always stay securely in place (of course I use a topcoat over the studs to add longevity).  I also really like the fact that this product includes both silver and gold studs, as most studs only come in one single color.</li>
    <li> The studs came in sooner then the delivery date so that was a huge plus. They also came nicely packaged and came which gold and silver studs as stated. The 4mm are perfect size for small nails. I however have normal sized nails but they still look so cute. My friend who has smaller nails also feels like they compliment her. I attach them using superglue or nail glue and they will not move until i remove them. Great purchase these are sure to last me a while ^-^</li>
    <li> These are great just like the picture.  But Ebay has them cheeper for a lot more pieces. Will purchase from Ebay in the future</li>
    <li> These do not fit nicely on the nail at all. Really hate these nail studs. Do not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received these items in great condition. Make sure you have a set of tweezers to put these on. They are definitely the size stated in the description. Perfect for even small nail beds. I bought 3 different shapes when I purchased these. Love them all!</li>
    <li> the package is small but it is what u pay for. plus makes it easier for storage. the product itself is very good. hold us and makes all your nail designs awesome! easy to work with, fun to look at :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh and it came pretty quick too....!</li>
    <li> I love these studs. They look really neat on my nails. I had a little bit of a hard time attaching them, but otherwise they are great!</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to maneuver but they look pretty on my nails :) The size is perfect!</li>
    <li> A little big but looooooove them!</li>
    <li> Arrived before expected delivery date. As described. Worth it!</li>
    <li> The studs are just to big for nails they don&#x27;t look good on. And they&#x27;re not even shiny. The color is just really dull like if it were colored by a crayon.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THESES AND THEY NEVER CAME OMG I SAT THERE AND TOLD THEM I WANT A REFUND THEY GAVE IT TO ME I WILL CONFESS BUT WASTE OFF YOUR TIME.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really pretty and they came in much earlier then I expected :)</li>
    <li> These dissapointed me when they didn&#x27;t come in a nail wheel, however they are super cute and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty. I love them.</li>
    <li> So upset! Got my order in and was excited to open the package, once i opened it i was so dissapointed, they look nothing like the pic in my opinion. Next time i&#x27;ll have to be more selective when buying things.</li>
    <li> Got these to try them out and ended up loving them so much!!!! I got a lot of compliments to!!!</li>
