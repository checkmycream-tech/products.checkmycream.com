<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> New product  for me.  Absorbs completely on hands.  Keep  in the kitchen.  Will order again, hope it is still on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where they came up with the retail price for this.  The lotion is great; but, Walmart sells it here for under $6 for this size bottle.</li>
    <li> Dove products are always awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It has a beautiful,  creamy,  feel to it and it makes my skin so soft and smooth.  The fragrance is nice and soft,  too.</li>
    <li> I will get to the point.  This lotion does not mesh well with my body chemistry at all.  It makes me smell like coitus and that is not cool.  The soap I usually use is either the Dove Sensitive or basis soap so they really don&#x27;t have a scent, except sometime the Dove soap will have that scent of rendered animal fat.  I bought it from a local B&amp;M and silly me tossed the receipt.  One the plus side, this lotion moisturizes well but I must stress that I use Dove soap to cleanse my skin.  So my skin is not so dry and itchy like it usually is during the winter months.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why it is so hard for the chain drug and grocery stores to stock.  Even when they take the time to advertise it, nothing shows up.  Even called the manufacture to ask if it were discontinues.  Excellent, non-greasy lotion for the whole body.  Price is good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I wish it was less waterty. It does not moisturize the skin.</li>
    <li> I love Shea Butter in my lotion it makes my skin feel so smooth and silky</li>
    <li> Love this scent that Dove makes. I use the entire line of products.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion, no waxy feel, very nice soft fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very creamy lotion with a nice amount of oil.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Low price, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff! Keeps him looking soft and smooth all day long!</li>
    <li> It smells like a nursing home.  My mother uses it.  It smells horrible. I have to burn incense just to try to cover up the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I love the Dove Cream Oil, and this one is even better because I love the smell of Shea Butter. It reminds me of Hawaii, and that&#x27;s always a good thing :)</li>
    <li> It is so smooth and smells wonderful. Like a vanilla coconut or some kind. Definitely would repurchase</li>
    <li> its a little too greasy/oily for me. It makes my hands feel thick and slimy. If you do buy this, use as little as possible unless your skin is super dry</li>
    <li> Leaves skin nice and smooth great buy</li>
    <li> The best lotion for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Smell isn&#x27;t terrific or horrible.</li>
    <li> Watery and highly perfumed. I don&#x27;t know what they thought Shea butter smelled like when they put in the perfumes but it&#x27;s definitely not whatever they used. Also it&#x27;s very watery and needs to be reapplied multiple time during the day to actually keep skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> The lotion works perfectly on dry skin. It&#x27;s easily absorbed and leaves the skin dry and moist for a long time. The lotion transformed my dry skin to silky smooth skin, also to note the lotion is affordable unlike other lotions. The lotion is also not great which makes it perfect for any dressing. For it does not stick on any fabrics.</li>
    <li> Do not like the Shea Butter smell.</li>
    <li> My skin is usually very dry in the winter. After I use this lotion once after the shower, the lotion keeps my skin smooth for the whole day!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my skin feel really nice. I have dry skin and this oil cream seems to keep the skin moist for a longer time than loions.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good lotion. Has a nice mild scent. Really does give all day moisture. However, I really wish I would&#x27;ve waited for the winter when my skin is drier.. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband for his dry skin. He likes and stated that after 12 hours his skin still felt moisturised!  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Looks good and smells good!</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion.  It smells great, absorbs well, and does the job.</li>
    <li> Hasa very subtle scent that smells luxurious. My skin feels so soft and I just feel sexier when I use it.</li>
    <li> The lotion has great smell, spreads easily on the skin and feels soft after application. Loved the product and would buy again.</li>
    <li> good and smell great and my skins not so dry</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the feel of this lotion</li>
    <li> Have used this for 12 years now, ever since my Oncologist recommended it after surgery. My skin is soft and protected, not bad for a 73 year old!!  : )</li>
    <li> This product has a pleasurable fragrance and it is very good to the body. I liked very much and i recommend</li>
    <li> Great product for extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Love the scent and it does not leave a greasy film... Hope they make it forever.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for folks like me with really dry skin. First of all, the scent isn&#x27;t heavy but very nice. Secondly, this lotion really does soak into the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling. And, important for busy people, it really does last all day! It&#x27;s nice to have smooth skin again! Thanks Dove, for this product!</li>
    <li> I like this product. The smell is a little overpowering for me but overall it&#x27;s a good lotion.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing  I use it right after the shower.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is fragrant without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;-The lotion is not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;-My skin absorbs it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-The lotion moisturizes without having to be re-applied too often.</li>
    <li> The Dove Cream Lotion is fantastic!  I get super dry skin this time of season that some lotions just don&#x27;t soothe.  This lotion soaked right into my dry skin, leaving it nice and smooth after just one application. I instantly fell in love with it. Not to mention it smells wonderful.I definitely recommend buying this product!</li>
    <li> Loved the smll and smoothing tendencies.</li>
    <li> The Dove Cream Body Oil contains shea butter and Skin Nourishing Oil and is truly amazing. It keeps my skin feeling noticeably hydrated for twenty-four hours. This lotion completes my showering routine every morning and was worth every penny. I am more than happy to continue to buy this product for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product I am so glad i purchased this It is everything i expected. I would purchase this product on  a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer, smells clean!</li>
    <li> This is truly the best lotion I have ever used. Have used this for several years.. Not greasy feeling and my skin is smooth and soft. Light fragrance, doesn&#x27;t over power or smell like a suntan lotion. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Need to use a lot to get results; smells nice.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this and I love the way her skin feels and smell.</li>
    <li> Lotion is lotion... But dove is good stuff</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels on my skin after putting it on over night. It feels weird when the lotion on your skin touches your blanket and clothes but you won&#x27;t feel it after falling asleep. Also, the lotion doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable during the night so you should be able to sleep without difficultly. When i woke up in the morning, it felt surprisingly soft and warm. It still feels soft throughout the day. Though this is during the winter months so when summer comes hopefully it will still feel comfortable and soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a best lotion for winter</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good feels so good love in a bottle it lasts along time if you have dry skin this is your guy and mix with dove soap it lasts for hours</li>
    <li> Great product Very Creamy Lotion, really helps dry skin on legs. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body lotion for two years and I can&#x27;t let it go. It is absolutely great. I am dark skin and it works great moisturizing my skin. Also love the scent !</li>
    <li> I discovered this lotion in 2013 and it&#x27;s all I will use, year round.  It&#x27;s one of the few rich lotions that actually sinks into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky/tacky/greasy afterwards.  Makes skin velvety soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is delicious...somewhere between Nilla wafers and toasted pecans, and it lasts a VERY long time, yet is not super-sweet or overpowering.  Even better, I&#x27;m able to wear it at work (I work in a hospital!) and apparently it doesn&#x27;t aggravate the super-sensitive ppl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this lotion, I have ZERO cracking/flaking/chapping in the usual problem areas (elbows, knees, legs, area on my back where my bra rubs and the dryness it causes would normally drive me nuts, were I not using this product!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A winter must-have!</li>
    <li> Good product, but the shea butter version (this one) has a slight undertone to the scent I can&#x27;t put my finger on but that is not nearly as pleasing as the non-shea butter version.</li>
    <li> First of all, I think this smells so great! It&#x27;s kind of like expensive perfume, but not to worry, the scent is not strong once it is absorbed onto the skin. It also does a right job of moisturizing my dry flaky skin. The consistency is quite light and just a tad bit watery, which is good, it make sit easier to spread on the skin. I took off once star because it is tacky. It&#x27;s not greasy but it&#x27;s tacky in a way that it sticks to fabrics and can be uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Moisturizer with a pleasant smell</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly. Not greasy at all. Light and it works!</li>
    <li> Very good delivery, but the photo served to deceive, because I thought they were two lotions.Picture that leaves doubt and leads to error.</li>
    <li> best lotion ever, im lovin it, the smell is good or just normal smell, not like others reviews said about the smell that was bad, not true, it smells just fine, i like it and will buy again</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. The cream oil feels so good on my skin and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Always had dry skin -- even as a young child.  After 2nd degree sunburn all over at age 16 -- over 40 years ago -- had to go around all summer in turtlenecks and use Lubriderm twice a day thereafter.  Have tried just about every lotion (and heavier cream forms) every since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product soaks in really well and is not greasy.  Might not be for people with normal or moist skin.  After I get any kind of water on my hands I must use lotion.  It is second nature for me to lather up many times through waking hours.  Second nature.  This one lasts a long time on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks into my feet at night and I wake in the morning without the usual very dry feeling in my feet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for about a week and im impressed. It makes my skin very soft and improves my skin tone also. I will continue using it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams and lotions over the years and this one is  by far the best.  I will continue to buy it now that I have finally found  something so good.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  My skin is very dry and the cream oil has the consistency of a lotion but moisturizes like an oil.  The shea is an added bonus.  Your skin is soft and supple without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I had to research hand/body lotions that was gluten free and found Dove offered something I could actually use.  I love the feel to the lotion.  It&#x27;s not greasy and the lotion soaks up immediatley and smells nice.  The price was good too.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> A little greasy, but get the job done.</li>
    <li> Really do love this product. Smells great and the scent is long lasting too. Great lotion for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove Cream Oil Body Lotion for a couple of years now.  The fragrance is really light (if really present at all), and it keeps me moisturized all day.  And best yet, it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin angry!</li>
    <li> Dove usually has mildly scented products.  However, this cream smells much too strongly of cocoanut butter or whatever the secent is.  The scent lingered for hours and I was forced to wash it off because I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer..  Neither could my husband.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and restores the skin wiping out the dryness and smoothing the skin</li>
    <li> Works really well...Love the subtle smell.</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves my skin feeling smooth, all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent texture. Very easy to put on. Good smell. I also bathe with Dove&#x27;s body wash.</li>
    <li> Dove Cream Oil Body Lotion is great, keeps my skin moisturized all day, it has Shea Butter which I love, and you gotta love the product as it is Dove, they never have bad products, a great all over body moisturizing lotion that also smells excellent and keeps your skin supple and looking great, you need a bottle today, I highly recommend this lotion from Dove, it is guaranteed to give you what you want and from a well known company you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
    <li> I love this!  Smooth and moisturizing, lovely scent.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion for a long time, mostly for economic reasons. After trying another brand that begins with eucerin, I won&#x27;t be purchasing  this again unless my brains fall out. A few years ago Dove shortened the pump, making it more difficult to dispense the lotion without making a mess. That, combined with the need to reapply every 20 minutes is why I am not recommending this product. I will say that it smells great and feels soft to the touch. But that &amp;#34;Gone in 60 Seconds&amp;#34; is a deterrent.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. I have extremely sensitive, dry, itchy skin. When using this, my skin isn&#x27;t itchy at all and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out either. It&#x27;s very non-greasy, so I can use it not only on my body but also on my face and hands. The Shea butter version even smells good! The other Dove cream oil lotions don&#x27;t smell as pleasant as this one. I will continue to use this lotion for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to love this lotion but it leaves my skin feeling sticky, really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion,smells good,leaves my skin soft and it&#x27;s a tad cheaper than buying it from the store.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing but im not sure why it makes my hands feel greesy. It doesn&#x27;t make the rest of my body feel that way just my hands. Smells fantastic too.</li>
    <li> I think Dove product are superb...</li>
    <li> dove body lotion is great I love the scent and how it makes my skin feel great  I sure love the feeling thanks dove.</li>
    <li> I will buy more when this bottle runs out.  My only complaint was that I thought I was getting two bottles due to the picture?, and only recieved one.</li>
