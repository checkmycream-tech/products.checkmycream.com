      <li>This is great stuff.</li>
      <li>great price and delivery to my door.  </li>
      <li>Great lotion.</li>
      <li>Great smell?</li>

      <li>So glad to received my Suave Body Lotions-Cocoa Butter&lt;br /&gt;Suave has the best products ever</li>
      <li>I just love it and it smells wonderful!  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!! :)</li>
      <li>A nice scent, and great softening.</li>
      <li>The lotion smells good.</li>
      <li>It smells good</li>
      <li>this lotion smell good in the skin :)</li>
      <li>Inexpensive and effective.</li>
      <li>its good..with nice smell...</li>
      <li>He just wants something to give him that bit of moisture for his skin on his way to work, and most times doesn&#x27;t want to use my scented lotions, but we&#x27;ve never found just that perfect kind of lotion for him &amp; me both to share.  </li>
      <li>, it smells amazing (like hot chocolate!), and it does a great job.</li>
      <li>Loved this light chocolate smell.</li>
      <li>The old lotion for me was the best lotion out there.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it the way I did before.</li>
      <li>I just think it&#x27;s a great all-around product.</li>
      <li>SMOOTH will be an understatement!</li>
      <li>My legs literally feel like a smooth stick of softened butter!</li>
      <li>Will not buy any more.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of it</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>For the price this lotion is ok</li>
      <li>The 2 problems with most lotions is that they 1) Stink  2) Are greasy and don&#x27;t absorb.  </li>
      <li>As someone who does love the smell of cocoa</li>
      <li>What more can you ask?</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve got a winner!  :)</li>
      <li>am I am glad I took the packaging</li>
      <li>And I was :)  </li>
      <li>It is not an overwhelming smell</li>
      <li>This scent is much lighter than the old formula, which smells delicious but can be overwhelmingly strong at times.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very quickly into the skin and does not leave me with a sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>But the best thing about this product is that after freshly shaving your legs and taking a shower, smooth this lotion over your entire body and let me tell you...</li>
      <li>I liked the old formula for cocoa better better.</li>
      <li>The lotion itself is perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>I will now have to find another cocoa butter lotion, perhaps Palmer&#x27;s, or use scentless Lubriderm, both are more moisturizing than Suave; the scent is what kept me loyal to them.</li>
      <li>The old product smelled like cocoa butter - a light pleasant chocolate scent.</li>
      <li>This is a quality product that provides great moisturization for a low price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>got it for my girl and now she smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve made a cheaper formula and added cheap perfume.</li>
      <li>I too loved the old product - pre 2014.</li>
      <li>You just feel sexy, smooth, and smell fresh.</li>
      <li>but I have loved the scent of the old formulation for years and that is the reason i bought it.</li>
      <li>I know I can buy this in the store but the &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; feature was very tempting!!!</li>
      <li>Your skin feels CLEAN and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Nothing special here just another lotion.</li>
      <li>Love the smell plus so creamy the shipping was fast too</li>
      <li>really liked the old formula when I bought it a couple years ago, despite the watery texture.</li>
      <li>and it thanks to that I really love this product.</li>
      <li>it now has a sicky sweet almost floral fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion so much.</li>
      <li>A good example is a few hours after applying the product a friend of mine was able to smell it on my hands while standing 3 feet from me.</li>
      <li>I used it all up till I was about 7 1/2 months pregnant (because I ran out)</li>
      <li>So many of them are loaded up with water as the main ingredient that as soon as the wind hits you turn into a sugar crusted raisin.</li>
      <li>The main reason is that the texture of the lotion is MUCH better than it used to be.</li>
      <li>I brought it home because I love anything with shea in it, and I also love the smell of cocoa butter, so I knew I&#x27;d be an instant fan.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this on my pregnant belly twice a day</li>
      <li>The new formula still carries a hint of that chocolate scent, but to me it smells most like coconut.</li>
      <li>I own a bottle each of the new and old formula of this product, and I can honestly say I prefer the new formula.</li>
      <li>I used to love, love, love this product - preferring it to much more expensive lotions, but not anymore.</li>
      <li>Purchasing this is worth it.</li>
      <li>Everyone is right.  </li>
      <li>As a moisturizer it feels great on my skin, better than most other products I have used in the past.  </li>
      <li>Both formulas are very moisturizing, but I think the new one wins out because of the better</li>
      <li>You can definitely tell its got cocoa butter in it which I&#x27;m told is a very good way to lock in moisture if you have dry skin,(which I do).  </li>
      <li>the old formula is almost offensively strong compared to the new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As many have pointed out, the old formula smells very chocolatey.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, it sits on his nightstand and on his way out the door every morning, he uses it!  </li>
      <li>I would only recommend this product if you really, REALLY love Cocoa Butter.</li>
      <li>Makes you feel smooth and soft all over.</li>
      <li>Most cocoa butter products are hard or super greasy so you just give up on them after a few applications, but this lotion is the perfect consistency to apply and leaves you feeling silky soft.</li>
      <li>I totally LOVED the old one so when the bottle was empty</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this pretty much ever since it came out.  </li>
      <li>I have to agree with pretty much everyone else.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know that the fresh bottle I purchased a month ago was a new formula until I got home and used it.</li>
      <li>This one has a mild, natural scent of cocoa and Shea butters.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!  </li>
      <li>The lotion was very watery</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>I used to really like this creamy body lotion.</li>
      <li>Same run of the mill light perfume smell.</li>
      <li>she puts it on because she know how much i like her smelling like this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The lotion works well to soften skin and keep it from drying out.  The main negative I have is that the scent is overpowering.  Some might like the scent but sometimes when I use the lotion I get a headache from the scent of the lotion.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because of the weather but when I got this bottle it was a little watery and didn&#x27;t feel like it absorbed at all.&lt;br /&gt;I even shook it a few times and still the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Either way after using a bunch I feel moisturized, but not quite the thicker consistency that I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> My husband is known for grabbing the baby&#x27;s lotion on his way out the door, or, even more frustrating - MY lotion.  He just wants something to give him that bit of moisture for his skin on his way to work, and most times doesn&#x27;t want to use my scented lotions, but we&#x27;ve never found just that perfect kind of lotion for him &amp; me both to share.  Until we found this product!  I brought it home because I love anything with shea in it, and I also love the smell of cocoa butter, so I knew I&#x27;d be an instant fan.  And I was :)  But then the true test was whether or not my hubby would like it and would start using it instead of my personal lotions and the baby&#x27;s lotion.  Sure enough, it sits on his nightstand and on his way out the door every morning, he uses it!  We&#x27;ve got a winner!  :)</li>
    <li> got it for my girl and now she smells fantastic. she puts it on because she know how much i like her smelling like this.</li>
    <li> Everyone is right.  The old lotion for me was the best lotion out there.  the new one that says \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; is terrible.  Horrible new floral smell &amp; doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used scores of moisturizing lotions because my hands dry out like a raisin in the winter... cracking... it&#x27;s horrible. The 2 problems with most lotions is that they 1) Stink  2) Are greasy and don&#x27;t absorb.  This one has a mild, natural scent of cocoa and Shea butters. The reviewer who said it was overpowering must be like the Princess in the fable, \\&quot;The Princess and the Pea.\\&quot; And few lotions absorb like this one. You can&#x27;t even feel it on your hands after it soaks into your skin. Your skin feels CLEAN and moisturized. You don&#x27;t need to wipe off your hands before you touch things (like I do with \\&quot;Eucerin Plus Intensive Repair\\&quot;... wow, is that stuff greasy! This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Yep, they changed it on us. Loved this light chocolate smell. Doesn&#x27;t help with my dry skin anymore either. Same run of the mill light perfume smell.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself is perfectly fine. The biggest problem I have with this lotion is the smell. It is extremely overpowering and lingers for far too long. A good example is a few hours after applying the product a friend of mine was able to smell it on my hands while standing 3 feet from me. The smell persisted after I had applied the lotion before bed, and woke up the following morning, and I&#x27;m not talking about I could smell it a little bit, I&#x27;m saying my hands reeked of cocoa butter 8 hours after applying it.    I would only recommend this product if you really, REALLY love Cocoa Butter.</li>
    <li> The search for the right lotion has always been a struggle for me, especially in the winter. So many of them are loaded up with water as the main ingredient that as soon as the wind hits you turn into a sugar crusted raisin. This lotion does the complete opposite. It truly does keep you moisturized for 24 hours. But the best thing about this product is that after freshly shaving your legs and taking a shower, smooth this lotion over your entire body and let me tell you...SMOOTH will be an understatement! My legs literally feel like a smooth stick of softened butter! This is great stuff. I don&#x27;t know what else to tell you except try it one time and you&#x27;ll see. Another great thing for those not fond of the cocoa butter scent, it does not linger at all. You just feel sexy, smooth, and smell fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion so much. It&#x27;s cheap, it smells amazing (like hot chocolate!), and it does a great job. What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> this lotion smell good in the skin :)</li>
    <li> This cream is extremely watery and does not hydrate skin the way it is suppose to ! It leaves my skin still dry after use</li>
    <li> I own a bottle each of the new and old formula of this product, and I can honestly say I prefer the new formula. The main reason is that the texture of the lotion is MUCH better than it used to be. The old formula is extremely watery and I usually end up pouring out too much because it&#x27;s so thin. The new formula is thick and rich and much easier to control. Both formulas are very moisturizing, but I think the new one wins out because of the better texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent seems to be a big issue for some other reviewers, too. As many have pointed out, the old formula smells very chocolatey. The new formula still carries a hint of that chocolate scent, but to me it smells most like coconut. This scent is much lighter than the old formula, which smells delicious but can be overwhelmingly strong at times. I have both bottles sitting in front of me and the old formula is almost offensively strong compared to the new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the old formula when I bought it a couple years ago, despite the watery texture. I didn&#x27;t know that the fresh bottle I purchased a month ago was a new formula until I got home and used it. At first I was disappointed, but over the past few weeks I&#x27;ve grown to like the new formula much better than the formula I was expecting. This is a quality product that provides great moisturization for a low price. I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the best cocoa butter/shea butter lotion out there, but I&#x27;m very happy with it and will probably continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now. It smells good its an all-day product meaning I apply it in the morning and it still working in the afternoon. I think it&#x27;s great for males and females. I just think it&#x27;s a great all-around product.</li>
    <li> After using this lotion I am a big believer in the softness and moisturizing that only cocoa butter can delivery.  Most cocoa butter products are hard or super greasy so you just give up on them after a few applications, but this lotion is the perfect consistency to apply and leaves you feeling silky soft.</li>
    <li> While I try to exercise optimism in all areas of my life,I just don&#x27;t like this lotion.It smells artificial (unlike Palmer&#x27;s which actually smells realistic) and the lotion is not moisturizing,in fact my skin almost felt drier than before applying it! Couldn&#x27;t find a redeeming quality :/</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in new formulation of Cocoa Butter with Shea body lotion, not even worth one star for cheaping out the product. How can you claim \\&quot;Now Richer Formula\\&quot; when the main ingredients advertised have been moved down the ingredient list to 14th and 18th place indicating this new formulation has LESS of the products than before this new formulation?  Cocoa Butter and Shea Butter used to be the 6th and 7th ingredient, NOW they are the 14th and 18th ingredient. This new formulation is not soothing and leaves me feeling dry instead of moisturized. I would rather pay more for the old formulation than to buy this new one at the same price.</li>
    <li> Nothing special here just another lotion. For the price this lotion is ok it does what it&#x27;s supposed to helping with dry skin.</li>
    <li> its good..with nice smell...</li>
    <li> A nice scent, and great softening. My hands and feet are doing much better since I started using it; and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I know I can buy this in the store but the &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; feature was very tempting!!! So  I Bought IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Not only I bought for the smell it works great and has not made my skin e achy and it thanks to that I really love this product. Was unsure how it was going to get it. But since it was from AMAZON I took my chance am I am glad I took the packaging was great and no spill which was great.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used!!  I have tried EVERYTHING out there and nothing compares with Suave Cocoa Butter with Shea Moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve got a bottle in the bathroom, my bedroom, the kitchen, a tube of it in my purse, and a bottle in my office!  It is the bomb!!  I&#x27;ve been using this pretty much ever since it came out.  Once in a while I&#x27;ll venture out and try a different lotion just for a change, but ALWAYS come back to this lotion.  I just love it and it smells wonderful!  You can definitely tell its got cocoa butter in it which I&#x27;m told is a very good way to lock in moisture if you have dry skin,(which I do).  Plus you just cannot beat the price.  I highly recommend this to everyone!  LOVE IT!!! :)</li>
    <li> I too loved the old product - pre 2014. I ran out and went to Walmart thinking they just changed the label.  I really loved the smell of the older product but this new one is not pleasant at all. Wish they didn&#x27;t change the formula. I need to find me a new lotion since I will return this one and never buy this product again. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with pretty much everyone else. They&#x27;ve ruined this product with the new, awful smell and it hardly seems to have any effect.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling cocoa butter lotion on the planet!</li>
    <li> This was a blessing for my pregnancy! I used it all up till I was about 7 1/2 months pregnant (because I ran out) and I had NO stretch marks what so ever and I just put it all over my belly and hips before I went to bed or when my stomach felt itchy and it did wonders.. Wish I woulda ran to the store for another bottle because after a couple weeks of thinking I&#x27;m not going to get any stretch marks BAM there they were! I was a petite girl before the pregnancy then during gained about 50 lbs and still waiting for my little girl now. The product works wonders! Get it and don&#x27;t stop using it!!!!</li>
    <li> I used to love, love, love this product - preferring it to much more expensive lotions, but not anymore. They&#x27;ve made a cheaper formula and added cheap perfume. I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore.</li>
    <li> great price and delivery to my door.  Beats a trip to CVS.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Not only is it great to keep you protected from harsh elements that can dry out your skin, but it is also great for everyday use. I have been using this on my pregnant belly twice a day and it is working wonders for the itchy feeling I was having and it is keeping at bay stretch marks. I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I started to buy this lotion because I love the smell of chocolate, and wanted to have a faint scent of it on me. I don&#x27;t like perfume and thought this would be perfect for me. Ran out a few weeks ago, have moved and finally got a chance to replace it yesterday. When I used it today I realized that they changed the formula. I don&#x27;t know what it smells like anymore but it is not chocolate. It is not an overwhelming smell but I don&#x27;t love it the way I did before. I hate it when companies do that. I am not sure if I am going to buy it anymore after I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I tried a small sample first.  Great body lotion. Makes you feel smooth and soft all over. Purchasing this is worth it.</li>
    <li> So glad to received my Suave Body Lotions-Cocoa Butter&lt;br /&gt;Suave has the best products ever and I am a fan.</li>
    <li> I am an unhappy customer of a Suave product. I did not buy it here on Amazon, but at Wal-mart. Anyway, Suave changed their recipe for this lotion. It is not at all the same as it used to be. I totally LOVED the old one so when the bottle was empty I purchased a new one. But then when i used it I knew IMMEDIATELY it was different. &#x27;New Richer Formula&#x27; apparently just means more perfume &amp; less cocoa butter. It actually stung my skin a little. I&#x27;m thankful that my skin wasn&#x27;t dry and cracked. OUCH! Withe change in ingredients it simply doesn&#x27;t work as well. I am finding a new brand of cocoa butter lotion. :( I would NOT recommend this lotion. Though I would have &amp; DID recommend the old one. SUAVE PLEASE CHANGE YOUR RECIPE BACK!</li>
    <li> Lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling too oily? Check. Great smell? Check. Leaves my hands feeling soft? Check. Will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Suave Cocoa Butter with Shea for years. It was my standard, to to lotion, and I kept a bottle of it in almost every room, particularly, the kitchen. After doing dishes, I always put on lotion, but can&#x27;t stand when I put on lotion, then sit to eat, and my hands smell like perfume. Suave was perfect because it smelled like yummy chocolate. Now it stinks. I don&#x27;t even like this scent for any purpose. I will now have to find another cocoa butter lotion, perhaps Palmer&#x27;s, or use scentless Lubriderm, both are more moisturizing than Suave; the scent is what kept me loyal to them.</li>
    <li> I have been using Suave product for a while. Suave body wash, lotion, shampoo and conditioner. I like them all. Inexpensive and effective. I used to really like this creamy body lotion. It had Cocoa Butter and Shea and it was great. But, they have changed the formula for this lotion by adding less cocoa butter and shea. These two integral items are now near the bottom of the ingredient&#x27;s list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is that the lotion is not as creamy, doesn&#x27;t last as long and repeated applications are required. It smells a lot like perfume and not a whole lot like cocoa butter and shea. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I liked the old formula for cocoa better better. this works okay but I have loved the scent of the old formulation for years and that is the reason i bought it.</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable. The lotion smells good. I just wish the lotion was a little thicker. It feels watery. But, I still recommend it to others....</li>
    <li> Love the smell plus so creamy the shipping was fast too</li>
    <li> Very good moisterizer.  I love the feel of it going on.</li>
    <li> On 1/1/13 - I buy a replacement bottle of this great lotion. It has changed!! Front says &amp;#34;Smoothing&amp;#34; &amp;#34;now richer formula&amp;#34; - and &amp;#34;with cocoa butter and shea&amp;#34; and a new graphic. NEW?? Oh! NO!! NOT my favorite lotion!! I read the label: WELL, the cocoa butter and shea have moved DOWN on the ingredient list [meaning LESS of those items]. The OLD product was called &amp;#34;Cocoa Butter with shea body lotion&amp;#34;. The new product is PEE-weW! stinky- it now has a sicky sweet almost floral fragrance. The old product smelled like cocoa butter - a light pleasant chocolate scent. I ran to Walmart today - and bought EVERY bottle of the OLD product, alas only 3 left. The rest were the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;. I will search long for the OLD lotion! My star rating is for the OLD lotion -5 stars! If I were to rate the new one  ...ZERO....as soon as I run out of the old, and can&#x27;t find more - I will be searching for a different lotion.</li>
    <li> I usually love Suave products but this purchase was a let down. The lotion was very watery and when I put it on my skin there was no hydrating effect. It was a waste of time to apply it everyday so I threw the bottle away.</li>
    <li> Formula has changed. Will not buy any more.</li>
    <li> Normally I only buy fragrance free products since the smell of synthetic perfumes makes me sick. As a moisturizer it feels great on my skin, better than most other products I have used in the past.  It absorbs very quickly into the skin and does not leave me with a sticky feeling. However, the smell of cocoa from this lotion lingers all day which those soulless chocolate haters will not be a fan of.  As someone who does love the smell of cocoa this product is win-win for me.  It keeps my skin from drying out while being aromatherapeutic.</li>
