      <li>I have really enjoyed this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I bought this based on the many rave reviews</li>

      <li>Pretty good product support.</li>
      <li>Well the story has a happy ending; they sent a new dryer, a newer model that works just as well.</li>
      <li>It was worth the $5 to check out the product - sure wish I could justify keeping it!</li>
      <li>The 4000i has ridges around the filter opening so in can be opened relatively easily.  </li>
      <li>I had really liked using the dryer - fast results!</li>
      <li>I was trying to get used to it because it sure dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I WENT TO THE SEDU WARRANTY WEBSITE AND DOWNLOADED A PDF FORM, AND FILLED IT OUT.</li>
      <li>Bought this to help my wife with her hair breakage; she&#x27;s gone through one cheap blow dryer after another, every 6 months or so, for years and years.  </li>
      <li>and I loved my old dryer.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE THE ORIGINAL BOX WITH UPC CODE, AND THE RECEIPT.</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth the investment!</li>
      <li>Four stars instead of five because the end cap to clean the filter is stuck on.</li>
      <li>I think the motor is tooo strong or the blades just melt right off the fan.</li>
      <li>I think it speeds up my drying time by at least 10 minutes and sets my hair perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Every minute that I can save in getting ready is precious.</li>
      <li>I returned this one and bought the blue babyblis which I love!</li>
      <li>I really use and abuse my dryers every day and this is a fine blow dryer, however before this I had the Sedu 4000</li>
      <li>I will say it is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>-- I expected a better product and better customer service.</li>
      <li>so I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and shiny:)</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have searched far and wide for the world&#x27;s most perfect hair dryer, and I will look no further.</li>
      <li>This is a very powerful hair dryer, too powerful for me really.</li>
      <li>I have used many expensive blow dryers and this one is by far the best I have tried.  </li>
      <li>so most of the time I never dry it all the way.  </li>
      <li>I personally think this hair dryer is better than the Babyliss, T3 and SuperSolano</li>
      <li>but I fell that for this price point the dryer should last much longer without problems!!!!</li>
      <li>From the description, I was expecting magical things for my fine, limp hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer I have long hair</li>
      <li>she says it really puts out a consistent heat and blow pattern as to keep her hair from frizzing and getting overheated as she styles her hair.</li>
      <li>This dryer is comfortable to hold for a long time, has very consistent heat control and is gentle on my color treated locs.</li>
      <li>I certainly recommend paying for this hairdryer.  </li>
      <li>I am perfectly fine using this until it burns out, but I will go back to the Sedu 4000 again.</li>
      <li>I especially love the cold button.  </li>
      <li>so I was very nervous about blowing that much money.</li>
      <li>However, I get up at 4 am to get ready for work.</li>
      <li>The Sedu dryer at first only blew cool air</li>
      <li>Unlike many other dryers, it has a push on push off button</li>
      <li>But one day, after about 14 months of normal usage, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND!</li>
      <li>product worked extremely well for the 10 months I was able to use it, but I would not recommend spending $170 on an item that breaks after 1 year.</li>
      <li>But the day came when my old dryer didn&#x27;t seam as hot anymore.  </li>
      <li>The construction on the dryer was my main concern.</li>
      <li>It definitely dried my hair efficiently, and I liked the pointed end to direct the air.  </li>
      <li>my hair is soft and shiny!!</li>
      <li>but he went right back to sleep.</li>
      <li>If something like this happens, the customer should receive a refund or a new blowdryer.</li>
      <li>I had been in the market for a new dryer and decided on this one.</li>
      <li>They send me a brand new.</li>
      <li>It does dry my hair quickly-</li>
      <li>I have never spent this much on any hair product</li>
      <li>I have purchased many professional grade hairdryers in the past.</li>
      <li>I wish I had read the other reviews saying it broke quickly.  </li>
      <li>I bought this blowdryer and within one month the motor makes this loud rattling noise.</li>
      <li>I have noticed it is not as loud as my old dryer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t make noise just not as loud as what I was using.  </li>
      <li>Wish I&#x27;d stuck with the old one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have long hair and it is hard to dry.  It takes forever so most of the time I never dry it all the way.  I was at the point in the winter I would wash it mostly at night because we have cold winters here and leaving the house with wet hair only made me freeze all day.  Yes the Sedu Revolution 6000i is not as lite as my older dry and I loved my old dryer.  But the day came when my old dryer didn&#x27;t seam as hot anymore.  I purchased this dryer to replace my old one.  The Sedu dryer at first only blew cool air but it did make hair look good but there are days I&#x27;m in a hurry.  So I was telling my spouse how disappointed I was in the dryer because of all the research I did.  He was trying to make me in a better mood and started playing around with dryer asking did I check every button.  As he was really getting on my last nerve putting the dryer in my face and turning it on after pushing button.  I noticed the air was really warm.  He told me he had just push the blue button on the front.  I love this dryer now.  I have had it over a month now and still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sude Revolution 6000i puts out good air which I like and it does get very warm.  I have noticed it is not as loud as my old dryer and my cat doesn&#x27;t run off when I turn it on.  I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t make noise just not as loud as what I was using.  My spouse and I have to work different shift hours sometimes.  I have to take a  shower times when I get off duty and get home.  My other hair dryer would wake him up.  After I used this dryer a couple of times it did wake him up but he went right back to sleep. I&#x27;m just now starting to play around with all the different things the dryer does.  I don&#x27;t want to run my luck but with the things I have notice with this dryer I will be happy if it last a good year or two I will say it is worth the money.  For me to say that I must really be happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
    <li> This dryer is comfortable to hold for a long time, has very consistent heat control and is gentle on my color treated locs. I did a video review on this dryer for locs here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/UpFgWMfRJh8</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer in November of 2012 and in September of 2013 while drying my hair the motor suddenly started making a horrible noise/vibration.  If I tilt the dryer I can hear a piece of the dryer rattling around inside.  This item had a 90 day return policy, so no return is possible on a dryer that was $170.&lt;br /&gt;This product worked extremely well for the 10 months I was able to use it, but I would not recommend spending $170 on an item that breaks after 1 year.</li>
    <li> I have used many expensive blow dryers and this one is by far the best I have tried.  Everything about it is amazing.  I especially love the cold button.  Unlike many other dryers, it has a push on push off button so you don&#x27;t have to keep your finger on it.  I think it speeds up my drying time by at least 10 minutes and sets my hair perfectly.  I personally think this hair dryer is better than the Babyliss, T3 and SuperSolano (all of which I have owned)</li>
    <li> I purchased this on April 2013, and on Feb 2014 the motor started making a weird noise and I can hear something loose inside. I contact SEDU since they have a 2 years warranty, but this is NOT an authorized retailer !!! it looks like is a counterfeit not actual SEDU. Be aware of this and do not BUY from this retailer !!!! go to SEDU webpage and see authorized retailers!!!</li>
    <li> I have had my dryer for 2 years 2 months and it is not longer under warranty. Last week the dryer started making a buzzing noise while on; then the handle started vibrating to the point that I was afraid it would either shock me or burn out. I am waiting to hear from Sedu as to whether they are able to repair a product out of warranty. I love this dryer but I fell that for this price point the dryer should last much longer without problems!!!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased many professional grade hairdryers in the past. This is the best.  In fact, I ordered two more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this hair dryer. It is definitely worth the money. I spent hours reading reviews before buying this dryer. I have never spent this much on any hair product so I was very nervous about blowing that much money. However, I get up at 4 am to get ready for work. Every minute that I can save in getting ready is precious. This hair dryer has not only decreased the time to dry my hair from 15 minutes to 6 minutes, it also dries it in such a way that I don&#x27;t have to do any further styling of my hair. Awesome! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have no clue as to the value of this product, except my daughter research it and determined it was the best available so I purchased it for her at XMAS.</li>
    <li> I purchased the blowdryer bc my hair stylist chunk highlighted my hair and fried off pieces of my hair. I had two to three inch strands snd a lot of fly aways.  I can happily say that this blow dryer is bad @$$. Its tamed my frizz and fly aways. I can walk out the house without straitening it. Its salon quality. I do use loreal shampoo and conditioner, along with the rest of the products thatcthatcontains keratin in it. My hair feels soft and shiny:)</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t stop raving about this Sedu Revolution Hair Dryer... she says it really puts out a consistent heat and blow pattern as to keep her hair from frizzing and getting overheated as she styles her hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but feel inclined to do so based on a very scary experience with Sedu&#x27;s 6000 hair dryer. I had really liked using the dryer - fast results! But one day, after about 14 months of normal usage, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND! Sparks shot out of the base of the dryer, melted the wire, and it short circuited. Needless to say, I was pretty shaken up and thankful that my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire (it did burn my hand a bit). Furthermore, even though I had a 2-yr warranty, the company refused to issue me a refund. It&#x27;s been horrible. I post this review in an effort to allow other consumers to choose another product and not have a similar or worse experience with this company.</li>
    <li> I bought this blowdryer and within one month the motor makes this loud rattling noise. The fan breaks from the motor and the blowdryer begins to shake. I was so afraid of getting shocked. So, needless to say I was frustrated. I sent it back to Sedu because of the warranty. They send me a brand new. I used it again for about 4 months and the motor goes out again. The fan blades fall out again. I think the motor is tooo strong or the blades just melt right off the fan. For the price of this blowdryer I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about this stupid problem. Honestly, it works well if it didn&#x27;t have that problem. I&#x27;d rather stick to my $25 conair and not have to worry about getting shocked from the motor spinning crazy!</li>
    <li> love this dryer..i have really thick coarse hair and it dries in less than 10 mins my hair is soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the many rave reviews I read- however, I am not thrilled with the hairdryer.  It does dry my hair quickly- however, there is still a decent amount of frizz, and it is very hard to achieve the silky straight hair that I used get with my Chi.  This dryer was half the price of the Chi- and half the quality.</li>
    <li> I certainly recommend paying for this hairdryer.  It delivers results instantly.  My hair feels shiny, softer and styled.  Expensive but worth the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this to help my wife with her hair breakage; she&#x27;s gone through one cheap blow dryer after another, every 6 months or so, for years and years.  She claims it has helped quite a bit with the breakage due to drying more rapidly with less heat.I looked it over when it arrived and it does produce an impressive blast of air.  Both her and one of my daughters are using it, and they both say the ionic feature helps them straighten their hair with better results. They also really like that the cold air button doesn&#x27;t need to be held down, it toggles states when you touch it.  Noise is subjective, but it sounds to me about as loud as any of them ever sounded, except that the shrill high pitch is missing.  Compared to all those dryers she brought home before, this one feels solid and somewhat heavier. The cord is even thicker.  They&#x27;re happy so I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth.  Four stars instead of five because the end cap to clean the filter is stuck on. I applied enough force that I thought I would break the device so I left it in place. Guess we will hit it with a shop vac from time to time instead. Other reviewers have also reported this same problem.  EDIT: 11-12-2014 THIS DRYER HAS BEEN USED ONCE DAILY BY MY WIFE SINCE IT WAS PURCHASED LAST YEAR. YESTERDAY WHILE SHE WAS USING IT, THE FAN WITHIN THE UNIT CRACKED INTO TWO PIECES. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING WITH A 20 DOLLAR FAN FROM THE DRUGSTORE? I CANT. I WENT TO THE SEDU WARRANTY WEBSITE AND DOWNLOADED A PDF FORM, AND FILLED IT OUT. ACCORDING TO SEDUS WEBSITE, IF IT IS PURCHASED THROUGH AN &amp;#34;AUTHORIZED DEALER&amp;#34; THEY CLAIM THERE IS A TWO YEAR WARRANTY. I HAVE THE ORIGINAL BOX WITH UPC CODE, AND THE RECEIPT. THEY WANT YOU TO PAY A SHIPPING FEE OF AROUND 10 DOLLARS CHARGED TO A CREDIT CARD, AND YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE THE CARD NUMBER ON THE FORM. I WILL SHIP THE DRYER OUT TOMORROW. STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT IF THEY SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT OR NOT.....  Well the story has a happy ending; they sent a new dryer, a newer model that works just as well. I had to pay a few dollars for shipping. Pretty good product support. And to anyone who read that user&#x27;s review where they said buying this on Amazon is not an authorized dealer so you get no warranty, I did get the warranty. So there ya go.</li>
    <li> I really use and abuse my dryers every day and this is a fine blow dryer, however before this I had the Sedu 4000 and I prefer that model to this because of the weight and size. They both seem to have the same amount of power and heat functions and variety But this has a different &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feature that allows cold air to blow without having to hold the button in the whole time. I am perfectly fine using this until it burns out, but I will go back to the Sedu 4000 again.</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful hair dryer, too powerful for me really. I was trying to get used to it because it sure dries quickly. It left my hair over dried with no shine. No worry though because one morning it just stopped. I returned it and bought a Chi.</li>
    <li> Despite lukewarm reviews, I decided to go ahead and order this hair dryer anyway and match it up against my $30 Conair dryer, which I&#x27;ve used for the last 8 years with no signs of going - and much to my disappointment, it just isn&#x27;t all that.  It definitely dried my hair efficiently, and I liked the pointed end to direct the air.  But I already have that with my Conair dryer - and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the shine as some reviewers indicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for three days, looking for some way to justify the additional cost.  I couldn&#x27;t - so I returned it.  The best part - which is why I love Amazon - was the quick return process.  The funds were returned to my account within a day and a half of shipping, with a return shipping cost of $5.  It was worth the $5 to check out the product - sure wish I could justify keeping it!</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I have ever used in my life. I have searched far and wide for the world&#x27;s most perfect hair dryer, and I will look no further. Absolutely worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I love my Sedu Revolution 6000i Hair Dryer.  I have had so many compliments on my hair lately and it is due to my Sedu dryer--no more frizzies even when it is as humid as a swamp!</li>
    <li> This is one of the  best hair dryer I have ever used.  It dries my thick long hair in less than 10 minutes!</li>
    <li> Best gift I ever bought my girlfriend. She has long hair and it used to take 2 hours to dry, but now only 35 minutes. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer I have long hair it dries it fast with less fuzzy hair than normal hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to purchase this dryer. Unfortunately, after one month of regular use (short hair, I dry it once a day), the dryer overheated and stopped working. I returned it to the manufacturer&#x27;s agent (Exceon) with a note of explanation. The box was returned with a sticker on it that simply said \\&quot;we are unable to process this shipment\\&quot;. Very disappointing -- I expected a better product and better customer service. If something like this happens, the customer should receive a refund or a new blowdryer. (I&#x27;ve read that other customers had simliar experiences and we given a re-conditioned blow-dryer.)</li>
    <li> I own a Sedu 4000i which I love, so thought I would get the newer 6000i model for another bathroom.  This model is physically bigger than the 4000i.  The filter was not installed in the dryer, but loose in the box.  I attempted to open the back to insert it, and could not, even with a rubber can opening gripper.  I did not try more force for fear of damaging it and have returned it.  The 4000i has ridges around the filter opening so in can be opened relatively easily.  This newer model is smooth around the filter opening and there is nothing to grip, and at least the specific dryer I received could not be opened.  The replaceable/cleanable filter is the whole key to ensuring the dryer will last a long time, as a clogged filter causes the motor to run hotter, and will not last as long.  I am getting the 4000i as replacement.  I have had it for over a year and it still works great; the 4000i is the best dryer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I loved this blow dryer for the 11 months it worked, but it inexplicably broke last week.  Just made a weird booming/sparking sound and now I can hear loose pieces rattling around.  I&#x27;m so bummed.  I wish I had read the other reviews saying it broke quickly.  Amazon&#x27;s return window is only 3 months, so I missed that and I&#x27;m out of luck.  Trying to find a good replacement now.</li>
    <li> Please go to the Sedu website to look for an authorized dealer.  There is a 2 year warranty that is invalid if not bought from an authorized dealer.  I&#x27;m not saying this is counterfeit but they warn about it on their website.  This is not an authorized dealer so could be counterfeit.  Based on some of the reviews sounds possible.</li>
    <li> From the description, I was expecting magical things for my fine, limp hair.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything my older (and now thrown out unfortunately) hair dryer didn&#x27;t do - for a lot more money.  It does dry my hair a lot faster, but instead of the tremendous shine I was expecting, my hair ends up looking dull.  Wish I&#x27;d stuck with the old one.</li>
    <li> I had been in the market for a new dryer and decided on this one. I did not notice drying time to be any shorter however it did feel healthier than the old school revlon dryer I had been using. The construction on the dryer was my main concern. After one use the filter fell off and would not stay put. I returned this one and bought the blue babyblis which I love!</li>
    <li> LOVE the hair dryer - I have very dry, frizzy hair that normally becomes an afro when I blow dry it, but with this dryer and a round brush my hair is left soft and much less frizzy in probably half the time it takes other dryers. Love love love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company itself had sent me a defective dryer, one where the back attachment piece was broken. It took a very long time for them to respond to my complaint, and then delayed sending a replacement which was very annoying. Despite that, great product.</li>
