      <li>Like other reviewers have noted, the scent does not last long as a whole, but some notes do stay on my skin for the duration of the day.</li>

<li> scent some other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
<li> purchased without previously testing it</li>
<li> After the mint wears off there&#x27;s a slight floral backdrop.</li>
<li> It smells of green leaves and mint, not a candy mint, but mint growing in a garden, leaves, stems and all.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t have to throw it away, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
<li> It is difficult to find in the US</li>

    <li> Mint and lemon are the undertones in this spray.  It&#x27;s light and refreshing for the hot days of summer.  Love it!</li>
    <li> wonderful smell!  fresh, hit of lime.  purchased without previously testing it</li>
    <li> unique scent-uplifting, original and fresh- evokes green sceneries. 2nd time I buy it...thinking of trying other fragrances of the series.</li>
    <li> This cologne is fresh and natural.  My favorite. It is difficult to find in the US so I am glad I have a source for it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for women. I bought it thinking it would smell like a universal grass scent for men and women. It has a very light flowery lemon scent that is great but to feminine for men.</li>
    <li> Oh my word, this perfume is glorious. This may not be the most sophisticated scent in the world, but it smells amazing, and is just the right thing for a sunny spring or summer day. It smells of green leaves and mint, not a candy mint, but mint growing in a garden, leaves, stems and all. After the mint wears off there&#x27;s a slight floral backdrop. Highly recommended to lovers of fresh, sunshiney scents.</li>
    <li> Best scent for summer--nice, light, and fresh. Smells like freshly mown grass and mint!</li>
    <li> Light, bright scent that is minty fresh with a grass and citrus background. It&#x27;s hard to say exactly what this smells like, but it&#x27;s herbal and clean. Like other reviewers have noted, the scent does not last long as a whole, but some notes do stay on my skin for the duration of the day. Plan on reapplying if you want a stronger scent to last all day.</li>
    <li> This was considerably less costly than buying it at Sephora and I love this fragrance for the warm summer months and in between seasons.</li>
    <li> Counterfeit but pleasant smelling and a close match.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great! But it just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t for everyone - to me it smells like sweet mint with a hint of grass - and I love it. I wear it to work since it is light and non-offensive. Also, for 2.5 oz of a premium brand scent, I think it is a steal.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume  Love it Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;If I could afford it I would take a bath in it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Guerlain!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It is light and citrusy. It is a little minty but in a very refreshing way. Great summer scent.</li>
    <li> This smells awesome. .crisp and cool!</li>
    <li> I like the fresh smell of mint and grass. It really lingers, though, so don&#x27;t spray much on or the scent can be overwhelming</li>
    <li> this is a great scent if you like to smell fresh and minty. It is a very sporty smell that gets a lot of compliments and very few people complaining about their allergies.</li>
    <li> smells so good, but doesn&#x27;t last- which i understand, it&#x27;s not a perfume.  pretty, light, fresh- minty/tea-like.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t yet decided how I feel about this fragrance. It starts out like lily of the valley and then switches to that toothpasty scent some other reviewers have mentioned. The best part, though, is that it doesn&#x27;t have that sickening lingering smell I&#x27;ve noticed in some -- particularly Occitane -- fragrances. I won&#x27;t have to throw it away, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time more than 10 years ago, but the fragrance is still really modern and fresh, perfect for the day. Got a lot of complements. Totally recommend it, especially if you are like me, who doesn&#x27;t like &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; perfume.</li>
    <li> I looked online for scents that were light, not sweet, not floral.  I ordered this based on written description alone, and am very glad I did.  The scent is unique, meets all my criteria.  Very different, not for everyone, I love it.</li>
