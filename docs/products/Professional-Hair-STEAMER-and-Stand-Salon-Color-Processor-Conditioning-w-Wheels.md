      <li>The Salon Stores customer serivce was better then outstanding!!</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>They were kind and replaced.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying that we own a hair salon in Virginia.</li>
      <li>On 01/23/2012 I spoke to a nice guy in customer service who informed me my warranty had ended and there was nothing he could do for me.</li>
      <li>Look nice.</li>
      <li>I excitedly purchased this item with great expectations.</li>
      <li>So far we are VERY happy with this one &amp; are considering buying another.</li>
      <li>let alone started on command. :)&lt;</li>
      <li>I love this hair steamer</li>
      <li>Where do I start, I was in love with this Hair steamer untill it begin to smoke and shut off on me.</li>
      <li>but I still pushed thru hoping it would get better...</li>
      <li>Pay more for a better product or find one somewhere else.</li>
      <li>i bought 2 of these and neither lasted more than a month..</li>
      <li>My clients love it and request this service all the time.</li>
      <li>Works great , fast shipping</li>
      <li>We are both natural and its great to have the steamer at home so that you can style your own hair.</li>
      <li>There is some sort of tube going from the reservoir to the bonenet but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be many holes at all for steam to come out.  </li>
      <li>and I love that.</li>
      <li>Not having ANY instructions, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should switch on the 450 watt switch first, or the 750 watt switch or BOTH!?!  </li>
      <li>I received it and it was made of cheap plastice which when tightening would easily break apart.  </li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using the steamer with conditioner, my shedding has been reduced TREMENDOUSLY!  </li>
      <li>Cheaply built.</li>
      <li>So I definitely think it&#x27;s a great investment, but I don&#x27;t expect this one to last for a great length of time.</li>
      <li>Everything seems to be in proper working order and I felt great.</li>
      <li>I pressed the button for 750w, but it didn&#x27;t light up.</li>
      <li>but I will enjoy it while its working now....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also made with cheap plastic.  </li>
      <li>This steamer works great for conditioning and developing color for resistant grey hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of large and takes up a lot of space, but I think it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
      <li>ok I will never use both as I agree with another review its just to much power and this may cause your steamer to smoke or overheat and shutoff.</li>
      <li>They also offered to issue a full refund.  </li>
      <li>The customer service was polite and quick but their products are garbage</li>
      <li>I contacted the company via amazon and they quickly e-mailed me apologizing and giving me some instructions on how to put it together and how to use it.  </li>
      <li>I seen many steamers that were price really high</li>
      <li>we have had everything from them just stop working after one week of use to them melting &amp; boiling over with the very first use.</li>
      <li>I have to use tape to secure it and keep it from falling out of place and spilling hot water onto me.</li>
      <li>after receiving the item damaged, the company was able to replace the part, so far it appears to work well</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase AND for the price</li>
      <li>I will say, I am pleased with their customer service thus far</li>
      <li>So I bought the hair steamer and it arrived pretty quick.  </li>
      <li>right now im beyond furious with the way  </li>
      <li>I contacted the seller right away</li>
      <li>We are on our 2nd unit, so far so good.</li>
      <li>we have only had this one for about 6 months now but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight!</li>
      <li>On my way to deep condition:))</li>
      <li>I shld have known better since there was only two reviews posted.</li>
      <li>The first problem was there were no instructions.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;both leaked TONS of scolding hot water and took a while to heat up and start.</li>
      <li>unfortunately I had to make the best of it at the time because I had no time to worry about it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>First one stopped working in two weeks.</li>
      <li>once it turned on.. it would last at the most 4 minutes and then would shut off for good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It started off perfect and now I am wondering what went wrong</li>
      <li>I turned that button off and pressed the button for 400w instead and the button lit up; however, the heating element never got hot.</li>
      <li>When I added water to the blue canister that sits on top, a lot of water leaked into the chamber below (not sure if that was good or not).</li>
      <li>NOTE, what really angers me is that when I began reading the reviews of the unit, I found that many customer have posted the same complaints.</li>
      <li>Easy to put together only 2 screws, no direction needed.</li>
      <li>This really annoyed me because I cannot understand why they are still selling this product without working to perfect the flaws that are so apparent.</li>
      <li>and it seems to be working better than the new one I purchase back in Sept.2011</li>
      <li>I really guess you pay for what get.</li>
      <li>The steamer was very well packaged.  </li>
      <li>The re-ship was very speedy</li>
      <li>the boiler heats really fast and sometimes would smell like something was on fire ..</li>
      <li>To my dismay, there there was crackling sound, as the coil in the bucket started turning fire engine red, and looked like some sparks were flying, and an electrical fire about to ignite!  </li>
      <li>The company shipped really fast as well....</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m eternally grateful to God because I really didn&#x27;t want to deal with any problems.</li>
      <li>No instructions at all like really??</li>
      <li>it may be a hot mess of ticking metal, which they will most certainly think is a bomb.</li>
      <li>I explained to him very calmly how this steamer went south on me, and I am not the only customer having issues with this model.</li>
      <li>,the customer could  have get  hurt, this item is dangerous, because this product sould have been check out more good, before sold to me , Also the hair dryer with stand is drying only cool hair,I  am very unsatisfy ,please help me .</li>
      <li>I was so excited after having finally getting the unit in working order and began using the unit.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, you&#x27;re smart enough to put it together without directions, more than likely it won&#x27;t come with any.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to change postions just so my entire head get the full use</li>
      <li>I decided that I would remove the review but only after making sure the steamer worked properly.  </li>
      <li>Based off of more recent reviews, I have decided to just cut my losses and get my money back.</li>
      <li>easy to use, but it gets a little too hot.</li>
      <li>and they sent me a pre-paid UPS label to ship the product back to them, and from there I could opt between a receiving a full refund or a new steamer.</li>
      <li>My favorite amount of steam and heat by far but thin plastic cracks easily when used in salon</li>
      <li>I purchased this steamer and, like many others have now stated, my steamer completely shut off on me only after brief usage (10-15 minutes on the 750W setting).</li>
      <li>I will say that it&#x27;s worth a shot, especially at the price...</li>
      <li>If they did they would have shipped me out a new product maybe even an upgrade to make up for the inconvenience.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t bother taking the rest out because it looked used as opposed to being new as advertised.</li>
      <li>I thought i was getting a good deal on a quality hair steamer and was shocked at how cheaply made it was with flimsy plastic parts, the steamer had no company name on it, and no instructions on how to put it together.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
      <li>I again contacted the company and they immediately responded with different instructions from the original one and when that didn&#x27;t work they told me to ship it back to them</li>
      <li>Well I made my point clear, stood firm and he offered to send me a refurb model free of charge.</li>

    <li> hello , I choose this hair steamer , because it will work well for my salon service, and it did ,for only 3 mths,after ,it stop working, in April 2013, I had a professional tecnition ,check it, and he say ,it is manifucture problem, this item burn while  the customer was under this  Steamer ,the customer could  have get  hurt, this item is dangerous, because this product sould have been check out more good, before sold to me , Also the hair dryer with stand is drying only cool hair,I  am very unsatisfy ,please help me .</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that we own a hair salon in Virginia. We have tried about four different steamers in our Salon. we have had everything from them just stop working after one week of use to them melting &amp; boiling over with the very first use. We figured we were just going to have to bite the bullet &amp; purchase a very expensive $2000.00 unit until we gave this one a try. It was the only one we purchased that actually did what it was supposed to do. So far we are VERY happy with this one &amp; are considering buying another. we have only had this one for about 6 months now but so far so good. Probably will purchase the second one soon.</li>
    <li> I thought i was getting a good deal on a quality hair steamer and was shocked at how cheaply made it was with flimsy plastic parts, the steamer had no company name on it, and no instructions on how to put it together. It came thrown in a box without proper packaging. The steam only comes out on the high setting. I will never buy anything from salon supply store again!</li>
    <li> I just received the unit today.  There were no instructions.  There are 2 switches, one that says 400 watts and one that says 750 watts, and in the center there is a timer switch, which I don&#x27;t really get.  The tube going from the bonnet to a reservoir is cut.  There is some sort of tube going from the reservoir to the bonenet but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be many holes at all for steam to come out.  At any rate, I decided to add some distilled water to the reservoir that looks like it is something that might look like a distiller.  When I added water to the blue canister that sits on top, a lot of water leaked into the chamber below (not sure if that was good or not). The chamber below is a plastic bucket with electric coils.  Not having ANY instructions, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should switch on the 450 watt switch first, or the 750 watt switch or BOTH!?!  Since there were NO instructions, I simply turned on both switches.  To my dismay, there there was crackling sound, as the coil in the bucket started turning fire engine red, and looked like some sparks were flying, and an electrical fire about to ignite!  Now, mind you, my heart is racing at this moment, as I don&#x27;t have a fire extinguisher incase this thing bursts into flames!!!  At any rate, this crackling probably shorted out the entire unit, as it will now not come on. When I tried to take the water dispenser out, water started seeping from an area that looks like it holds electric parts!!! The grey area at the area at the base of the white plastic part that holds the plug!???  The question is how much worse could this get???  Now I have water coming out of random areas of the steamer.  The timer which I turned on, and then turned to 0, will not stop making noise. So, when I bring this to UPS it may be a hot mess of ticking metal, which they will most certainly think is a bomb. The is outrageous. You get what you pay for ladies!!!  Don&#x27;t buy an unreviewed device!   Of course the receipt contains NO phone number.  Thisis definately going back.  Definitely not a keeper!  Save your pennies and buy from somewhere else!</li>
    <li> I bought from ebay...won 2 from an auction . They are crap..works sometimes not all the time. Cheaply built. Hood does not tilt. One arrived busted . Crap crap crap....do not believe that this is a good item because it is not.</li>
    <li> Hair steamer was excellent</li>
    <li> love it! easy to use, but it gets a little too hot. need something to go around my forehead and ears</li>
    <li> OMGOODNESS WHERE DO I START!!! This box came with no instructions!  After I figured out how to put it together, I put water in the tank!  It started heating up and then immediately it died.  The 750 watt button does not work with the 400 watt botton.  The 400 watt button lights up however the coil is no longer heating up!!!  I just received this item in the mail less than 24 hours ago and this is my experience!  Please do not purchase this item!!!  THIS ITEM SHOULD HAVE ZERO STARS!!!  I wish I would&#x27;ve read these reviews before getting the item thank you!!  Bye The Way!! This Item is VERY POORLY MADE!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this! I purchased this steamer 3 weeks ago. It did not come with any instructions. I watched a YouTube video and read different blogs on how to assemble them prior to trying. Once the unit was put together, it took a while (45 minutes) for the heating element to get warm, but worked successfully afterwards. This morning would have been my 3 rd time using the unit. The unit will not function. I pressed the button for 750w, but it didn&#x27;t light up. I turned that button off and pressed the button for 400w instead and the button lit up; however, the heating element never got hot. It should not be this difficult. I guess that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s the saying you get what you pay for. I will be sending this item back. Please don&#x27;t make the mistake I made in buying this!</li>
    <li> I recieved my steamer today, it took longer than expected which was about about 5 days i was thinking it would take about three, when I got it it didnt come with instructions but it wasnt to hard to put together, I turned it on and it wasnt on 5 minutes before it just shut off and stopped working completely :( Im very disappointed but I feel like I shld have known better since there was only two reviews posted.</li>
    <li> I purchased this steamer and, like many others have now stated, my steamer completely shut off on me only after brief usage (10-15 minutes on the 750W setting). Nothing dramatic happened; it just simply cut off and then wouldn&#x27;t turn back on no matter what I tried. I contacted the seller right away and they sent me a pre-paid UPS label to ship the product back to them, and from there I could opt between a receiving a full refund or a new steamer. Based off of more recent reviews, I have decided to just cut my losses and get my money back. I will say, I am pleased with their customer service thus far but their product is sub-par, to say the least.</li>
    <li> This is the worse hair steamer I have ever used! I got it a month ago and it doesn&#x27;t even heat and make steam half the time or it shuts itself off! Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> This steamer is AWESOME my hair loves it! The features are great the quality is good. I seen many steamers that were price really high and I found a really great deal on this steamer. The dome is really big and the nape of my hair also get steamed which is a plus. I don&#x27;t have to change postions just so my entire head get the full use and I love that. The company shipped really fast as well.... FOLLOW UP!! 01/21/2012 OMG! Where do I start, I was in love with this Hair steamer untill it begin to smoke and shut off on me. The plastic cup that holds the water has melted on the side Im not sure what went wrong today but this is crazy. It started off perfect and now I am wondering what went wrong I contacted the company via email lets see how this goes....I will keep this matter updated **UPDATE** 01/29/2011)I contact the company via email they did respond back in a day or two with the wrong number for me to call but when I sent  a second email they provided the correct contact info. On 01/23/2012 I spoke to a nice guy in customer service who informed me my warranty had ended and there was nothing he could do for me. I explained to him very calmly how this steamer went south on me, and I am not the only customer having issues with this model. Well I made my point clear, stood firm and he offered to send me a refurb model free of charge. The re-ship was very speedy it arrive just a few days later and it seems to be working better than the new one I purchase back in Sept.2011 It takes sometime to heat up just using the 400 wats but thats ok I will never use both as I agree with another review its just to much power and this may cause your steamer to smoke or overheat and shutoff. Im not sure how long this one will last but I will enjoy it while its working now....On my way to deep condition:))</li>
    <li> So I bought the hair steamer and it arrived pretty quick.  The first problem was there were no instructions.  I contacted the company via amazon and they quickly e-mailed me apologizing and giving me some instructions on how to put it together and how to use it.  I then wrote a mixed review rating them a 3.  I was then contacted and offered a $25 refund to remove the mixed review.  I decided that I would remove the review but only after making sure the steamer worked properly.  Once I did follow the instructions they gave me the plastic hanging down in the catch cup between the metal heating device started to melt.  The steamer never started to steam even after 15 to 20 minutes.  I again contacted the company and they immediately responded with different instructions from the original one and when that didn&#x27;t work they told me to ship it back to them and once they received it they would ship me another one.  They also offered to issue a full refund.  I opted for the shipment of the replacement product but I explained if I got another bad product I would not only be contacting Amazon but I&#x27;d contact BBB and FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection.  Once I sent the e-mail I got a response stating that it would be in the best interest of both parties to issue a full refund at this time.  I think that says a lot.  I would not use this company going forward.  The customer service was polite and quick but their products are garbage and they don&#x27;t stand behind their product or distributors apparently.  If they did they would have shipped me out a new product maybe even an upgrade to make up for the inconvenience.  Instead they told me I didn&#x27;t have to ship it back I could just discard it.  If you do chose to do business with them I would definitely do all correspondence via e-mail so that when you have to file your complaint, you have adequate documentation.</li>
    <li> great price and works well, great shipping too</li>
    <li> The steamer is not a high quality product.  The materials are simply plastic and metal.  However, it does work.  I didn&#x27;t like that there were no instructions included for assembly and operation, but I figured it out after a couple of uses.  The small reservoir that collects the extra water in the plastic hood is not securely attached.  I have to use tape to secure it and keep it from falling out of place and spilling hot water onto me. The box was damaged when I received it and the operation was inconsistent, but I figured out later that it was due to the water level.  So I AM happy with my purchase of a steamer.  I&#x27;ve been natural for over 2 years and have always had a problem with shedding no matter what I put on it or did to it.  Previously I always sat under a bonnet dryer with my conditioner and a plastic cap. Since I&#x27;ve been using the steamer with conditioner, my shedding has been reduced TREMENDOUSLY!  So I definitely think it&#x27;s a great investment, but I don&#x27;t expect this one to last for a great length of time.</li>
    <li> No instructions at all like really??? I really guess you pay for what get.</li>
    <li> Look nice. First one stopped working in two weeks. They were kind and replaced. Second lasted one month.  Now just sit in nook, wife doesn&#x27;t want to bother to replace.</li>
    <li> My favorite amount of steam and heat by far but thin plastic cracks easily when used in salon</li>
    <li> I love it! Easy to put together only 2 screws, no direction needed. Very lightweight!</li>
    <li> This was the worst product I had ever purchased in my life.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with virtually no instructions and no information on warranty or the manufacturer sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn&#x27;t for no apparent reason.&lt;br /&gt;It has sprayed me with hot water while sitting underneath the hood.&lt;br /&gt;After a year if ownership and minimal use it will not wort at all.&lt;br /&gt;Do Not Buy this machine.</li>
    <li> The steamer was very well packaged.  Hopefully, you&#x27;re smart enough to put it together without directions, more than likely it won&#x27;t come with any. I tried to use it on three people back to back and after the second person it took a while before it would come back on.  It&#x27;s being used for personal use not in a salon.  I would NOT recommend this for use in a salon.  The steamer and bonet don&#x27;t lock on to the pole, which I think is a safety concern.  The condensation collection chamber can be difficult to manipulate and fills quickly. It&#x27;s kind of large and takes up a lot of space, but I think it&#x27;s totally worth it if you like to steam.  So far, I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase AND for the price I think it&#x27;s more than a great deal.</li>
    <li> Brough this steamer in early december .. i only used it like 6 times it broke just recently .. i have contacted the sellor and not a reply .. Turns out when these ppl sell you an item they are so quite yo change their information on you ...the instructions werent clear .I had to set it up with the help of my sister .. the boiler heats really fast and sometimes would smell like something was on fire .. please i advise you all not to trust theseppl with your money .Try and get a hair steamer some where locate cause right now im beyond furious with the way  human being treat others like money is all ... DO NOT GET THIS .god bless</li>
    <li> I purchased my steamer a few years ago and as everyone has stated, there were no instructions but with much prayer and common sense... I FIGURED IT OUT! Yes, there are two switches to choose from and. COMMON SENSE told me not to select them both at the same time, so I usually use the highest watt first just to get it nice n hot and when it starts boiling, I turn it off and switch it to the lower watt... So far, my unit has done its job and I&#x27;m eternally grateful to God because I really didn&#x27;t want to deal with any problems. I will say that it&#x27;s worth a shot, especially at the price... I paid a little over a hundred for mine...</li>
    <li> I think I got a faulty one because it just didn&#x27;t work well.  It&#x27;s also made with cheap plastic.  I&#x27;ll try another brand.</li>
    <li> 2 for 2.. i bought 2 of these and neither lasted more than a month..let alone started on command. :)&lt;br /&gt;both leaked TONS of scolding hot water and took a while to heat up and start. once it turned on.. it would last at the most 4 minutes and then would shut off for good.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair steamer I have african texture hair , which is natural and this hair steamer makes the worst conditioner feel like butter on your hair . And this steamer has professional settings for coloring your hair. Its a great product and Im glad I shop on line,  I would be in the poor house!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The steamer would not turn on just after two uses. Crap!&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Product broke upon setup. Filed a Claim and vendor was responsive.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long, even when you take care of it. Up until I moved last month, I was only using it to hang the clothes I would for the next day...</li>
    <li> This steamer works great for conditioning and developing color for resistant grey hair.  My clients love it and request this service all the time.</li>
    <li> I purchased the steamer on June 19, 2012, it came with no directions,just a email address. I&#x27;m waiting to hear back from someone. The steamer turned on and didn&#x27;t steam at all. And won&#x27;t turn back on.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in these&lt;br /&gt;And unfortunately I had to make the best of it at the time because I had no time to worry about it!&lt;br /&gt;I hv to tighten the bolt EVERY TIME AND DURING  using it or it falls on my clients head</li>
    <li> after receiving the item damaged, the company was able to replace the part, so far it appears to work well</li>
    <li> Please, Please, Please do not be tempted to buy this because of the price.  IT IS JUNK!!!!!  IT&#x27;S HORRIBLE.  Read the reviews, and believe them.  It will either not work or all or work for a couple of months and then break.  DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased the steamer for my sister for Christmas and she loves it. We are both natural and its great to have the steamer at home so that you can style your own hair.</li>
    <li> Works great , fast shipping</li>
    <li> Heats up qucikly, the 1st one we ordered heat coil burned out after one month. We are on our 2nd unit, so far so good. Hopefully it was just a glich in 1st purchase. The Salon Stores customer serivce was better then outstanding!! No problems getting another unit shipped out ASAP! I will deffinitly purchase from Salon Store again.</li>
    <li> I excitedly purchased this item with great expectations. The item was received in a timely manner, but with no specific directions on how to assemble the steamer. However, upon calling the customer service number, I received email instruction on how to correctly assemble the unit. I was so excited after having finally getting the unit in working order and began using the unit. Everything seems to be in proper working order and I felt great. Then without any warning, the unit shut off. I checked my electrical outlets, etc. to no avail. The unit simply is no longer working. I did not get one good usage out this steamer. NOTE, what really angers me is that when I began reading the reviews of the unit, I found that many customer have posted the same complaints. This really annoyed me because I cannot understand why they are still selling this product without working to perfect the flaws that are so apparent. Ugh!!</li>
    <li> I received it and it was made of cheap plastice which when tightening would easily break apart.  Don&#x27;t recommend this product.  Pay more for a better product or find one somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the steamer was all plastic and very dangerous. It&#x27;s a very bad product.!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read these comments before purchasing from this seller! I purchased mine on eBay but for some reason I couldn&#x27;t leave feedback. It came to me scratched, w/pieces floating in the hood &amp; the heating element appeared tarnished. I didn&#x27;t bother taking the rest out because it looked used as opposed to being new as advertised. I contacted the seller who requested me to send pics so I did. No response from seller &amp; then a notification my case would be closed so I contacted Salon Supply Store again &amp; they claimed to have not received the pics so I resent them. By this time I was tired of looking at the steamer sitting in the box &amp; decided to attempt to use it. Putting it together &amp; seeing the craftsmanship of this device made me skeptical to plug it in. Nearly every part is plastic, nothing snapped into place nor were there any screws to hold anything in place including the hood. It took a very long time to heat up &amp; the steam was very faint but I still pushed thru hoping it would get better...not, 10 minutes later it shut off!! I escalated my claim to eBay. Long story short I ended up closing this out thru eBay because the seller never got back w/me. When I was boxing it back up, I discovered that this steamer was delivered to me from the return center of salon supply store. Now why in the world is a new item being shipped out from the return center?! Deserves 0 stars!</li>
