    <li> Love the product. It has a great hold without being stiff. Usually lasts all day. I was going to get it from my stylist but her supply was depleted. So glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Just received it, but I have my doubts that  this is NOT like the original hairspray I got  from my hair salon.  Feels more sticky and a bit stiffer than normal. Disappointing to receive somthing you thought would be the real thing!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and ordered.</li>
    <li> great product, price and came quickly.</li>
    <li> This is okay. You seem to have to use a bit more but that could be because I&#x27;m used to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Stay Strong which is not a &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; hair spray. The smell is nice. Other reviewers feel that it is too strong but I like it. It doesn&#x27;t overpower my perfume either. Also a tip for aerosol users store it upside down and the nozzle won&#x27;t clog.</li>
    <li> allows me to work hair after spraying.  not stiff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sold on this one yet. First of all, I&#x27;m not sure I love the smell. It did hold the look without being sticky, but not for long.</li>

    <li> I purchased the All Around Flexible Hold Hairspary and that it not what was send to me.  What was sent was All Around color Protect Working HairSpray.  My wife was looking for a product that was Flexible and this product was not Flexible by any means. It is false in it&#x27;s name on the ordering of this product.  .</li>
    <li> I chose this hairspray because of the originator. The hair spray is heavy with the sent of nutmeg which makes it good for unisex. Personally I am not real crazy about the scent of nutmeg on my hair, but the products seems to work well.  I have very thin fine hair and the spray doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.</li>
    <li> I do not like my mousy hair stiff so this product is perfect for my.  Holds the doo for as long as needed.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has really good hold, without being to stiff and it smells so good!  It reminds me of cloves and fall.  I have ordered it twice and plan to reorder again.</li>
    <li> This hair spray works really good for me. I have very fine, thin, blonde hair. I am not the best at fixing my hair myself so having the right product to style make s big difference.  This stuff works.</li>
    <li> Holds well yet your hair still feels soft, not stiff. The smell is a unisex spicy sent.  I like it, however it quickly dissipates and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smelling that way if you aren&#x27;t crazy about it. I LOVE all the Color Proof products. Best products I have ever found for my fine, dry hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much! Wonderful seller! Loved an extra gift!</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped in timely manner. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this spray on me and I wanted to try it since it holds your hair color longer. I love the smell and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Well worth the $$. Highly recommend all the products in this line of hair products. The detaingler is the best I have ever had. Try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> This hair spray is great! It has strong hold, but doesn&#x27;t get stiff. It keeps my hair into the next day, so that is a plus.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray!  My girlfriend is a hairstylists in California and suggested I try while I was visiting. Loved it! I live in Montana and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere to purchase. Talked my hairdresser into purchasing the whole line and loves it also. I couldn&#x27;t wait for her to get the product in though so I purchased from this seller and was very  happy with the ship time and product.  Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a quality product.</li>
    <li> Great for fine hair that is dried out easily by hair spray - not heav, holds well in humidity and you can play with it after you spray it in your hair.</li>
    <li> Received wrong product plus the image is wrong on this page! What the heck?</li>
    <li> I would rate this hair spray as firm hold, not flexible as in description. I was looking for a light hold hair spray.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good hair spray.  It gives my hair more body than hold.</li>
    <li> Works well ... Don&#x27;t love the smell</li>
    <li> Nice lightweight spray. Like it for just casual everyday looks. If you want something for an intricate up-do or something you need to stay in place with humidity I would try their other stronger hold formula. But this is just a great product as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only spray I&#x27;ve used for several years and my hair dresser charges too much so I will be buying it from here I hope.It never gums up or builds up and I have very fine thin hair so I use it everyday and it holds until I brush it out or wash it out...</li>
    <li> need to ask my Italian mother in law</li>
    <li> Very good product line that keeps true to its word.  ColorProof does work and helps a lot in keeping my color lasting longer than normal.</li>
    <li> This spray is horrible!  It made my hair lose it&#x27;s shine and didn&#x27;t hold for more than 10 minutes after using it!  However, I do like their mousse.</li>
    <li> Great hold without plastic feeling.</li>
