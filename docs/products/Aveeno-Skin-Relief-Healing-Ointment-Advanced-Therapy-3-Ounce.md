      <li>Not too many places carry it, but Amazon does!!!</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>Great for use after swimming and on days not too sunny.</li>
      <li>So happy to have found this product.</li>
      <li>good effect.</li>
      <li>Aveeno is a good product.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>In comaprison, I use Blistex DCT lip salve on lips and knuckles, but this works so much better!</li>
      <li>To allow it to be in any way effective, the area to which it is applied must be covered to avoid smearing it or rubbing it off.  </li>
      <li>Great for super chapped skin.</li>
      <li>Doctor recommended for Eczema on prominent areas of body.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This is what keeps my hands from cracking in the winter. :)</li>
      <li>no one can believe how improved they are: heals cracked dry heels and (this is the best part)</li>
      <li>/&gt;EWG says the product is somewhat safe and doesn&#x27;t contain as much harmful chemicals as others of this kind.</li>
      <li>Delivery and packaging were fine.  </li>
      <li>Very good for severely dry skin!</li>
      <li>Walgreens would put in a special order.  </li>
      <li>It is well worth a try.</li>
      <li>Got a sample of this from my dermatologist and after 2 days no more pain and is healing beautifully.  </li>
      <li>right now im bidding on a lot of  48 sample tubes on ebay...</li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t use it on face in summer because I get so oily, but for any other time I love it!.</li>
      <li>I also see great relief on my knuckles which will get dry and crack open.</li>
      <li>Very think...almost like Vaseline.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For comparison, the rosebud salve sold at Anthropologie smells good and is thick, but it doesn&#x27;t heal cracked skin like the Aveeno ointment.</li>
      <li>It worked on my husband&#x27;s dry skin better than anything so far.</li>
      <li>This Aveeno product helps calloused skin - particularly elbows, knees and feet heal &amp; disappear almost overnight.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick, but that makes it so effective.</li>
      <li>It is nice and thick and will not go anywhere.</li>
      <li>I have many products from this company that work for dry skin in a remarkably short period of time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very soft and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
      <li>I use this for my infant sons incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It really is the only product that protects my lips longer than a minute.</li>
      <li>It only takes the smallest amount, even for my whole face.</li>
      <li>This is a non-absorbable, heavy, ointment that only sits on top of the skin.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this stuff to anyone with the same issue.</li>
      <li>Finally, this fixed it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth ten of any other ointment.</li>
      <li>After several lotions and creams promising to fix dry cracked skin...</li>
      <li>My 12  year old came back from camp with dry cracked feet.</li>

<li> It did not penetrate my skin, nor did it provide any relief from dry patches because the skin does not absorb it, it merely sits on top.  </li>
<li> my skin is SO dry that the Vaseline in this product works well.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even been using it on my face in the evenings because my skin is so dry.</li>
<li> Whether you need it for chapped lips, dry winter skin, or cuts and scrapes, BUY IT.</li>
<li> Was unable to find a full size tube in any stores-</li>
<li> I&#x27;m currently doing a round of treatment with isotretinoin, and the chapped lips are NO JOKE.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> 20 other things i tried didnt work...</li>
<li> I had a half ounce sample tube of this stuff  from the doctor and it cleared it up by the time I finished the tube...</li>
<li> If you need something that heavy it works.</li>
<li> This petroleum-like ointment is not a favorite, not is it one I will purchase again.  </li>
<li> Have been using it on my feet for the past year and</li>
<li> I fell and had a huge scrape that was very painful.</li>
<li> This winter has been hard and drying to my skin.</li>
<li> Worried because it&#x27;s getting hard to find.</li>
<li> Hardly need any at all.</li>
<li> I found it to be the least valuable product from Aveeno I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
<li> Goes on thick like Vaseline.</li>
<li> This is a thick ointment that I use nightly.</li>
<li> What a disappointing product from Aveeno!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! Recommended by my dermatologist.  Not too many places carry it, but Amazon does!!!</li>
    <li> Received a tiny .50 oz tube from the dermatologist.  Was unable to find a full size tube in any stores- Walgreens would put in a special order.  Checked Amazon &amp; price lower than Walgreens, so order 2 tubes.  Excellent product if you need to repair the skin on your hands (or feet). A little goes a long way.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you whoever made this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This saved my skin (hand) during winter especially since I have to wash my hands constantly at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EWG says the product is somewhat safe and doesn&#x27;t contain as much harmful chemicals as others of this kind. That&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It is truly healing! Recommended by a dermatologist!</li>
    <li> My lips are constaly chapped and cracked in winter. This literally heals them in 1 day. Hardly need any at all. I&#x27;ve even been using it on my face in the evenings because my skin is so dry. It has not made me break out, which I am prone to. Probably won&#x27;t use it on face in summer because I get so oily, but for any other time I love it!. I also see great relief on my knuckles which will get dry and crack open. In comaprison, I use Blistex DCT lip salve on lips and knuckles, but this works so much better! It&#x27;s also very soft and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. It only takes the smallest amount, even for my whole face. So happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Doctor recommended for Eczema on prominent areas of body. Great for use after swimming and on days not too sunny.</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Dermotoligist recommended for keeping skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Delivery and packaging were fine.  This Aveeno product helps calloused skin - particularly elbows, knees and feet heal &amp; disappear almost overnight.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have had cracked heels for 12 years...tried EVERTHING...nothing worked...even that a &amp; d ointment for cracked heels ( all that did was eat the heels out of my socks )  Vaseline didn&#x27;t work...huskers didn&#x27;t work...lanolin didn&#x27;t work...20 other things i tried didnt work...I had a half ounce sample tube of this stuff  from the doctor and it cleared it up by the time I finished the tube...awesome stuff !!  but I cant find it in the store...right now im bidding on a lot of  48 sample tubes on ebay...hope I win !!</li>
    <li> It worked on my husband&#x27;s dry skin better than anything so far. It is well worth a try. Aveeno is a good product.</li>
    <li> my skin is SO dry that the Vaseline in this product works well. recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently doing a round of treatment with isotretinoin, and the chapped lips are NO JOKE. My dermatologist gave me a 0.5 oz sample tube of this ointment. It really is the only product that protects my lips longer than a minute. I only need a teensy bit, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, the rosebud salve sold at Anthropologie smells good and is thick, but it doesn&#x27;t heal cracked skin like the Aveeno ointment. Whether you need it for chapped lips, dry winter skin, or cuts and scrapes, BUY IT. It&#x27;s worth ten of any other ointment.</li>
    <li> Love this! This winter has been hard and drying to my skin. This is a thick ointment that I use nightly.</li>
    <li> Ointments give Longer acting relief than lotions.</li>
    <li> Very good for severely dry skin! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is what keeps my hands from cracking in the winter. :)</li>
    <li> Very think...almost like Vaseline. If you need something that heavy it works. Great for super chapped skin.</li>
    <li> Goes on thick like Vaseline. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I use this for my infant sons incredibly sensitive skin. It&#x27;s thick, but that makes it so effective.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST ever!  Have been using it on my feet for the past year and no one can believe how improved they are: heals cracked dry heels and (this is the best part) even my splitting cracked toe nails!  Love this stuff.  Worried because it&#x27;s getting hard to find.</li>
    <li> After several lotions and creams promising to fix dry cracked skin... This one works.  My 12  year old came back from camp with dry cracked feet. Finally, this fixed it!</li>
    <li> This is a non-absorbable, heavy, ointment that only sits on top of the skin.  I found it to be the least valuable product from Aveeno I&#x27;ve ever tried.

    <li> This stuff is better then Neosporin!!!! I fell and had a huge scrape that was very painful. I put Neosporin on it 2-3 times daily and was getting nowhere. Got a sample of this from my dermatologist and after 2 days no more pain and is healing beautifully.  I would highly recommend this stuff to anyone with the same issue.</li>
    <li> My derma gave me a sample. It is nice and thick and will not go anywhere.</li>
    <li> very good! good effect.</li>
