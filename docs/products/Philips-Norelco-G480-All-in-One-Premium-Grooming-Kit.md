<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great I gave it as a Gift but will soon one get one for me :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I didn&#x27;t think that I could get a nice trim from any product. Very professional and organized. Even a place for your brush!!</li>
    <li> Ok. To be fair, I was drunk when I first used this. I&#x27;m going to blame the fact that I cut my whole beard off on that fact. That being said, this thing rocked! I think you might need safety glasses to operate this thing. It was sending tiny bits of my once mighty beard all over the place, including my eye. Other than that, it has sharp blades, a nice storage bin, and a great sound!</li>
    <li> Guys, if you are tired of using heavier clippers and getting cut  then buy this product.  This kit has everything. its light and it doesn&#x27;t cut you and   the best thing it has different adapters, nose, sideburns eyesbrows, etc.  this is a great buy !!</li>
    <li> Does feel a little lite. I have only used it twice so far and am very happy with the purchase.The holding display is BS. Falls if you sneeze too close to it. Easy to change the different guards. The nose trimmer does not pull or yank. The power over all is nice. Have not used to trim my head..just the face. I would recommend you get this. Price is right...maybe get a bag to keep everything in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with electric shavers dying on me. Its been a couple of months - and it still works. Its got several different attachment and guide gives a confusing explanation of how to use them. Overall it feels like an ergonomic design and solid build.</li>
    <li> good product. not amazing.  the battery needs to be recharged often, but the machine does the job.</li>
    <li> i got this as a present for my father and he loves it. there are a great many attachments and it works beautifully</li>
    <li> I got this a Christmas present in 2009.  It worked quite well until around Christmas of 2010 when the attachment I used most had the plastic cover break.  There are 6 little plastic things on the plastic attachment that it used to select the length you wish to trim to.  1 of these broke so now I cannot use that attachment as any length I select will now trim unevenly and tugs at the hair.      I then began to use another attacment even though it did not work as well.  The same thing happened to the plastic length guard for this attachment too and now I can no longer use 2 of the attachments!    These covers are incredibly cheap and probably would have broken sooner if I used the trimmer more than once every month. I have not been able to find any place that sells replacement attachment guards so now I must buy a whole new beard trimmer after only 1 year.  The replacement will definitely not be a P-N.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer mentioned, the plastic combs are extremely cheap and started falling apart after a couple of months (even though I don&#x27;t use it that often). Replacements are hard to find and ridiculously expensive.    Otherwise the machine is good for the price, assuming you&#x27;re not planning on using it for more than a year...</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great!  When you consider the price, I really dont know how it could be beat.  The trimmer is powerful and does NOT pull out hair.  The attachments are precise, easy to use, and easy to change.  The shaving attachment is a little harsh on the face but this is a beard TRIMMER, not shaver, so that is to be expected.  The attachments are cleverly made giving you a wide range of widths and lengths to choose from.  DO NOT THINK TWICE ABOUT PURCHASING THIS TRIMMER!    -J-</li>
    <li> awesome -     I shave my head with the main piece. Nice!    Good for beards and all that.    Good price too!!</li>
    <li> If you are buying it for trimming beard, its not the best product but other than that its excellent :D</li>
    <li> Great shaver but you have to be very careful going down on the soft skin cause it can cut you instantly. Besides that its working great sofar</li>
    <li> I did nt like this product much. Bought this based on the review but found less quality than expected. I am using other brand products which are cheaper than this and give me more smooth cut.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer, works really well and the different attachments make it easy to switch between different grooming needs.  I wish it came with a travel bag though</li>
    <li> After reading through tons of reviews I finally decided to purchase (through a different website) this product for my husband and myself. After getting it in the mail, it was quite an ordeal getting it out of the plastic packaging, it seemed decent although the attachments felt a bit cheap. My husband was the first to use it and he said it worked fine (trimming his very short beard with the attachment) and he used the nose trimmer and said that worked fine. He could not use the ear trimmer b/c he said it was way too loud. I then used it to trim my pubic hair and bikini line...ouch! I used both trimmer heads (one with the eyebrow trimming attachment) and both of them snagged my hairs and also snagged my skin making me bleed. My husband then used it again to trim his neck and under his chin...snagged him a lot and made him bleed quite a bit. He also said the shaving attachment did not do a very good job.    I will be returning this product to the manufacturer as it has a 45 day money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Well the main trimer works OK. It trims my hair and beard just fine. It is all the attachments that don&#x27;t cut it. No pun intended. They just don&#x27;t live up to the standard. Price was about average. If I new about the attachments not working as well as desired I probably would have not purchaced this particular grooming Kit.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly fine for me. All of the attachments are easy to add/remove. Great for grooming yourself. Most of the time, one attachment will work for beards and hair. Really great value too!</li>
    <li> When offered the opportunity to review the Philips Norelco G480 All-in-One Premium Grooming Kit, I was excited.  With all the given attachments, it looked like it would be able to replace a few other trimmers and such that I own.  I&#x27;m happy to say that it *does* replace them, and I&#x27;m quite happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Norelco adjustable trimmer for a long time, used to keep my beard trimmed.  Nice, but the batteries don&#x27;t last very long and it&#x27;s a pain to clean.  This new trimmer does a much better job with the beard trim, and clean-up is a snap with the detachable heads.  Next there&#x27;s the...  uh...  noseandearhairattachment.  Suffice it to say it works, and better than the cheapo one I have.  We also have an actual hair trimmer that does a reasonable job, but this Norelco puts it to shame with more length settings, more power to the motor, and again, easier clean-up.  And while I use a razor for the under-the-chin trim, I could also use the mini-electric razor attachment for minor touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple all this with a few other attachments that I haven&#x27;t found a need for yet (precision trimmer, eyebrow trimmer, etc.), and this is a complete package.  I can ditch all my other gadgets, consolidate all my grooming requirements here, and free up some space in the bathroom cabinet.  My wife should be happy...  :)</li>
    <li> I like the fact there is a very precise blade. My dimples leave my goatee difficult to shave and the small precision blade is great. I also like the guards and they are better than the last one i purchased from this company. My one concern is that the motor doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as the last product I purchased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product with what all you want for grooming. I often use it for trimming my hair and shave my bear. I can even trimming my hair without anyone&#x27;s help. You can use it once in every few days to keep your hair as the same shape, just like a shaver for your bear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the trimmer for a few weeks now, and have had no problems with it. Vastly superior to my old dying one. I&#x27;ve only really used the beard trimmer, and the default head, which works great. Charged it to full when I bought it, and have been trying to run the battery all the way down before charging it again, and it still works wonderfully. My only possible negative is that I&#x27;ve once accidentally pushed too hard on the plastic beard trimmer, and had it decrease the setting by a couple notches (from a five down to a three). No harm done, but I was more careful with how I held it after that. The normal head works very well for trimming the length of the hair on my upper lip, and I have occasionally switched to the smaller one for more precise trimming. It also works very well on my neck, shaping my neckbeard pretty well. A few tugs of the hair, but nothing painful. I honestly doubt I&#x27;ll ever use the other extensions, it works great as a beard trimmer for me and that&#x27;s all I really need it for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the G480 Grooming System for a while now and have found it to be a useful, functional gadget.   I&#x27;ve used it to trim my beard (until returning to the totally clean-shaven look) and it did an excellent job in providing a uniform trim around the contaours of the beard.  It also does an excellent job in keeping my sideburns trim and neat.  I&#x27;ve not used the G480 to cut my hair but I have used it (with help) to keep the edges (around my ear and the back of the neck area) neat in between haircuts.      As advertised, the accessories provide the ability to trim your nose, ear, and eyebrows etc.   It is painless and efficient.    All-in-all this is a handy grooming kit.</li>
    <li> Clippers are great and is in a good storage built in! Would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not overly happy with this product.  I thought the battery would last longer than it did.  I think I&#x27;ve used it very few times (5 the most) to trim my nose and ear hairs and it ran out of battery.    I wanted to shave my 4 day scraggly beard with it but stopped as it didn&#x27;t work that great.  It took a lot of effort to shave clean a part of my face.  I stopped as I didn&#x27;t have all day to shave.    All in all, it is an ok product for trimming your body hair but don&#x27;t expect the battery to last too long.  For longer hair plan a little more time to achieve the results you want and recharge after use.</li>
    <li> I really like the Philips-Norelco products, and when my first trimmer after eight years went out of comission, I decided to buy this one mainly because I trust the brand. Sooo....this groomer fulfills my expectations and is working flawless every time I use it. Again, I think that it is the best in the market.</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose. It can be termesd as complete body groomer though philips claims it just for facial use.    drawbacks -   Do not have univeral power supply. You need to purcahse step down converter to use this outside US.  I wished if beard shaver attachment was little more wider, so I could have complete shave faster.</li>
    <li> Overall a good quality product.  Remains to be seen how long the unit will last.  Switching out heads/parts is easy, but if you&#x27;re dropsy like me, be prepared for a few hair explosions.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this kit from a big box store, and lost the trimmer on vacation. I couldn&#x27;t find it at the same store, so I checked Amazon, and they had a better price. I really dig the flexibility -the attachments cover a wide range of trimmers that you usually have to buy separately. I especially like that it comes with a tray to hold all of the pieces that includes a port to hold the charger plug. The battery life is pretty good.</li>
    <li> This is an excelant trimmer that makes trimming my moustache and sideburns a breeze.I always only used a moustache scissor and the trimmer on my electric razor, but this blows both of them away. I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
    <li> I recieved it vis USPS on time as promised... My older trimmers that I had for years were wearing down, and the set could not have come at a better time! It will make a great addition to my collection of trimmers. The stand is a neat thing as in the past I had everything strung out now they are in  a compact unit!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband almost two years ago, he uses it aboout once a week. I have never heard him complaign about it. This shaver and its attachments have come in handy for him and his thick hair. I also use the beard trimmer to trim our sons hair, this is quiet enough that it dont scare him. I have reccomended this product to several of our friends.</li>
    <li> My husband is very creative when it comes to shaving and grooming. This is the best product for him I got. He loves it and uses it almost everyday.</li>
    <li> GROOMER WORKS WELL, SATISFACTORY RESULTS WHEN USED . LIKE ALL THE DIFFERENT HEADS &amp; SHIELDS THEY ARE USEFUL FOR DIFFERENT USES . THE CAPABILITY TO DETACH &amp; CLEAN THE HEADS IS GOOD, EASY TO DO &amp; CONVIENENT, RUNNING TIME IS EXCELLENT . THE UNIT IS EASY TO USE , I STORE IT IN A SMALL TRAVEL BAG , WORKS VERY WELL KEEPS IT ALL TOGETHER &amp; NO LOOSING PIECES .</li>
    <li> This kit makes manly grooming less of a chore and a bit more fun. The attachments guarantee you have the right tool to quickly and easily remove hair, regardless of it&#x27;s location and the guides help you get just the results you&#x27;re looking for. I even groomed my eyebrows for the first time ever, no more random long eyebrows!</li>
    <li> For the price the quality is unmatched! I recommend buying this to anyone who is looking for a good beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Short term review, will update in a couple months.      First impressions regarding performance:  I purchased this trimmer as a beard trimmer and did not think I would use most of the accessories.  However, I&#x27;m pleased the unit came with a compact precision trimmer and adjustable guard, as I find this better suited to beard trimming than the larger standard beard/hair default (silver) blade.  I was not expecting the mini shaving foil to be very useful, but once again I was pleasantly surprised to find it extremely good at shaving a buffer zone around my beard (I use a norelco radial style razor and it&#x27;s difficult to be precise). I don&#x27;t think the nose/ear or micro trimmer blade will see much use.  The units power and speed are fine (much better than the trimmer feature on my norelco razor); note: this is not for clipping an entire head of hair.  I am quite pleased with the purchase thus far.    To clear up a couple misconceptions other reviewers have stated:  1) This unit is powered by a NiMH cell (far superior to NiCad as others have stated).  No it&#x27;s not lithium, but it is a step in the right direction.  2) The trimmer does indeed charge while in its stand, just as long as you find the hole/bracket for the dc terminal and insert it accordingly.      Major pros:  - 5 reasonable quality trimming heads (good designs, sharp blades), 3 easily adjustable locking guards  - Respectable build quality of the trimmer itself, the heads leave a little to be desired as they are not very robust.  - 30+ minute run time for this price bracket is above the competition     Things to improve (or save for higher-end models as Norelco does):  1) Use directly on power supply! This cost pennies to implement (my low-end norelco electric razor does it and it&#x27;s 10 years old).  I don&#x27;t like waiting 10 hours for a proper recharge when the juice is all used up.  2) A travel case would be an excellent addition.  All the accessories are fragile and easily damaged left unprotected in a travel sac.    3) REGULATED charging.  Why cant the transformer shut off by itself at a certain voltage like any decent NiMH charger??  Again, pennies for a big improvement.  Charging much over 12 hours and you are damaging the battery. I don&#x27;t like babysitting electronics.  4) Build quality of heads it pretty minimal.  They work very well, but don&#x27;t expect them to take a drop or any rough handling.    Bottom line:  Extremely good value for the engineering, quality, and rendered performance.  Accessory pack is more useful than I imagined.  Let me know if anything is better for &lt;1/4 Benjamin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality grooming kit for quite awhile.  My main issues are eyebrows, sideburns, nasal and ear hair - with occasional neck shave between haircuts.  I don&#x27;t have a mustache or beard, nor do I cut or trim my own hair, so those accessories will probably not be used.    I am very pleased with the kit - it does a great job and is well-designed.  The only thing that isn&#x27;t quite up to snuff in my opinion (or maybe I just haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of it yet) are the clear plastic combs that act as adjustable &#x27;stand-offs&#x27; to ensure uniform cutting length.  I have only used the precision trimmer comb for my eyebrows, and it slipped out of position and I cut my eyebrows too close (but they grow back so fast anyway that it&#x27;s no big deal).  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great kit, especially for the money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. Started using right out of the package with so many useful adapters.&lt;br /&gt;Very light weight so great for traveling with.&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention easy to clean? Just run it under hot water and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a decent trimmer, so i could give my self a decent crew cut.  on a budget of 30$ i found this trimmer to be the best option at the time and was willing to take a risk with it    First off its a familiar brand and its under 30.  but I was still afraid that it could not handle my extremely thick head of hair.  after a quick wash and comb the trimmer cut threw with out any snagging or slow down. it all so lasted the entire time with out having to plug it in, so took me almost 2 hours to finish cutting and trimming.    It also came with all the attachment one would need for facial/head use  I am very pleased with this product.    The only real issue it may have is that some of the attachments seem prone to breaking. id recommend being cautious of leaving them lying about and to keep the trimmer clean at all time to prevent future issues    Despite the materials not matching the actual design quality it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I primarily needed a trimmer for my goatee.  I&#x27;ve been going through lots of Wahl trimmers that the battery fails out within a few months, or just isn&#x27;t that strong of a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I might as well go for one with more heads as I&#x27;ve discovered as you get older more hair shows up and it needs to be addressed.  Annoying fact of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself is a very strong trimmer and I&#x27;ve been unable to &#x27;grind it out&#x27; and get it to slow down doing my bi-weekly grooming tasks I would do with others.  The stand works, it holds the charger connector in place and you don&#x27;t have to futz with it, just push it in click and it&#x27;s good.  I do wish it had a better charging indicator as it&#x27;s actually on the wall wart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is it uses the most terrible packaging on the planet.  Stupid plastic clamshell crap you have to fight to open.  Even cutting with scissors and what not it stuck and when I ripped it open one of the little heads popped out and hit the ground - shattering everywhere.  I put it back together but either the nose/ear trimmer port doesn&#x27;t work right or it&#x27;s futzed for good.  I&#x27;m going to write norelco and see if they&#x27;ll replace it.  But this packaging has got to go.</li>
    <li> Received product in a timely manner.  Quality of product was good.  Product performed well in the purpose that it was ordered for. Thanks</li>
    <li> I own this. At first it worked great. The charge life has slowly decreased. Which is a pain because it has to be charged to use it. If it runs out half way thought. You have to charge it to finish.   The attachments have broken. It does not clip as well either. I would not recommend it. Spend a few extra bucks and get something that&#x27;s better quality. I wish I had!</li>
    <li> This is my first machine that cmpre to use as shaving and the truth is that it worked perfectly. Its charge time and duration of load is perfect, light and very functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His pieces are very useful and has good strength. Maintenance is very easy and care are minimal and always maintained the same performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point that is against the noise, which over time becomes a little harder and sometimes annoying, especially if you use very early in the morning, maybe someone at home uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall a great product is very good.</li>
    <li> norelco web site states this is an international model,ie should accept 220v power supply, they are wrong, it only accepts 110v, cannot use it overseas unless with a transformer, otherwise works fine !</li>
    <li> I bought this item, because I really don&#x27;t love to shave, so I needed something that helped me keep my beard in control so I ended up buying this Philips Grooming kit, it works great on my face, it&#x27;s great on detail and very easy to use. What I don&#x27;t love very much is how it performs in other body areas, there&#x27;s where it has more trouble, it is not very safe, pinching and cutting a little, so you have to be extra carefull. But all around gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The Norelco looks great, comes with a handy (if bulky) stand for all of the accessories, a charging cord, and a brush for cleaning out hair.  The finger rest/cutout may look a little silly, but proves quite useful when attempting to reach specific or delicate areas.    The larger, clear plastic attachments don&#x27;t click in to place as easily as I would like, and they depend upon bending a section of the plastic itself for up and down adjustment as opposed to a separate metal component - this may weaken the plastic over time.    Make sure and read the charging directions; this is a nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery as opposed to a lithium-ion, which means taking a few extra precautions when charging.  DO NOT leave it plugged in at all times, as this will waste energy and decrease the battery life - fully charge the unit and use it until it is obviously using power.    The detail trimmer works great for between the eyebrows, etc., and the nose hair trimmer does a passable job (read: mediocre) job - I&#x27;m sure a dedicated nose trimmer would do better, but you can&#x27;t beat the all-in-one aspect of this set.  The detail (mustache/beard) attachment does a great job at the nether regions as well.    I obtained the trimmer at a lower price point than the current $40 or so, and was thus a bargain for me at $25.  I haven&#x27;t used some of the longer trimmer attachments for my actually hair yet, but I&#x27;m sure they will come in handy eventually.  Happy trimming!</li>
    <li> I bought this product b/c the ads conveyed it as a heavy duty tool, that could withstand the atrocity of shaving my back. This turned out not to be true. This product is weak! The battery prematurely ran out, and I was left with half of my back looking navy seal team six, and the other half absolute caveman. The razor heads hurt the skin.     Very disappointing product, Philips!</li>
    <li> I used this for giving haircuts to my kids. It&#x27;s pros are that it&#x27;s quiet and not intimidating to them.  The cons are that while I&#x27;m still getting used to it, their cuts are a little choppy.  Other than that, a great clipper!  Easy to use and the attachments are easily interchangeable.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible trimmer that just feels cheap. The battery on mine quit holding a charge within months of owning it. You can&#x27;t use it plugged in either. I am done with Philips Norelco and going to try Reminton or Wahl next. I suggest you save you time and do the same.</li>
    <li> I love this kit.  With all the shaving heads and combs, trimming facial hair is really customizable and easy.  You can get very accurate cuts.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> It is a good product, very easy to use, have good battery backup. Worth buying for its cost of $26.00.</li>
    <li> This groomer is replacing a Norelco shaver that finally gave out. After carefully reviewing what was available, I wanted to find something that was not too expensive to get the job done, but at the same time, be of poor quality. So far, the groomer has performed as expected. The only thing that concerns me are the attachments. Knowing that I am not one to handle items delicately, I can foresee the day that I break the attachments. They are made of clear plastic and have \\&quot;slots\\&quot; to increase or decrease the distance from the blades. So far, none have broken, but I&#x27;ve only had this for a few months. The groomer and all the blades and attachments are neatly stored in the provided stand. The packaging, though, is a struggle to open. Get your scissors or better yet, your single-edged blade, ready. You&#x27;ll need it to open it up.</li>
    <li> Picked up this trimmer kit after my last trimmer refused to charge. My previous trimmer was battery operated with a vacuum trap which didn&#x27;t work very well. I tend not to trim to often, around once every three weeks or so, and the unreliable battery meant I had to charge it every time I wanted to use it (which meant I needed to plan my trimmings instead of just doing it). I&#x27;ve had this particular kit for a few months and I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;ve only charged it once when I received it, and I&#x27;ve been able to use it several times without having to worry about battery or charges. I like all the different attachments, and have come in handy when doing special beard cuts (like the good old chops). The plastic for the guards is a little flimsy, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that yet - as long as they stay on the base and don&#x27;t fall of I doubt they would break in regular use.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it! He wears his beard close cropped and it does a great job. If only it cleaned up after itself. ;&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had this for about six months, and recently one of the plastic guards cracked/broke. I called Norelco and within five minutes talked to a REAL PERSON who was very friendly and helpful, and a replacement trimmer/attachments is on the way, with a prepaid envelope to send back the one that broke (it&#x27;s working fine, it&#x27;s just the guard that broke). How often is a manufacturer that easy to deal with? LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I&#x27;m downgrading my review... sadly, the guards break if you even look at them the wrong way. We&#x27;ve been through three now. They have great customer service, I&#x27;ll give them that... but that only goes so far when you have a cheap, flimsy product. Such a shame... it works great otherwise, wish they hadn&#x27;t cheaped out on the guards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the ear/nose trimmer along with a couple of the other trimmers and all work well for me. The packaging keeps all honest people out but I&#x27;m not too sure about others. In addition, the \\&quot;stand\\&quot; is flimsy at best but it does hold everything that was included.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t work like i thought it was going to work... the detail trimmer doesn&#x27;t work the way it is supposed to, nose trimmer and beard trimmer works alright, all in all it is better to spend more money and get something better, but this product is still worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great grooming kit.  I use it to trim my goatee.  I also use it without a guard to shave as I cannot use a regular razor or even an electric razor.  This gets a nice close trim without skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE all of the attachments and how easily it adjusts to tackle multiple hair lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer is nice to have as well!</li>
    <li> I have to say very good quality from Philips again. I like Philips brand they make good quality products. This one at just 25$ is an awesome purchase. Very Good Trimmer, I like to keep beard I dont like to shave. 5 Attachments .. All can be cleaned under the water tap. yes they are washable. So awesome. Buy these... !! Thanks amazon!! :)</li>
    <li> This product works well for trimming beards, mustaches, eyebrows, pubes, etc (when you use the guards).  The problem is that the long hair trimmers are terrible for creating clean lines on your sideburns or beard.  It chews up my skin and doesn&#x27;t cut well at all.  I still have to use the long hair trimmer on my electric razor for that (which is kind of ridiculous).  For some reason, I still haven&#x27;t found a better long hair trimmer than the one on my cheap Panasonic razor (which was sadly stolen).  Also, this thing is terrible at holding a charge.</li>
    <li> hi i just got the philips norelco G480 i like this machine so much accurate trimming and the portable heads are very nice you can use them for all hair types everywhere   its easy to use and very flexable  i have always been a fan of philips shaving machines  the main advantage is the bear trimmer as the head narrow and it cuts all the hair is the same size unlike the brown bruser that keeps uncut hair becuase of the wide spacing.</li>
    <li> At first this was a great product. Battery lasted about two weeks with light use to trim up my beard. I got it during spring and this week I noticed it was a little low so I put it to charge. Since then, it won&#x27;t even turn back on! Junk!</li>
    <li> i gave to my husband for chritmas. He loves it. the only complaint he says one of the items for the machine pull the skin. really good for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice grooming kit for $23.77. Overall, I am very happy with it but I like Norelco G380 better; it is stronger.</li>
    <li> I was not finding the beard and mustache trim gear I wanted in the local drug stores so I went to old reliable, Amazon.com.  Norelco Phillips is well known world wide so I trusted the brand name and ordered this set.  It is actually over-equiped as it contains a wide blade and combs for actual hair cutting which was not my need.  I ended up with more gear than I can use.  However, the small and easily changed heads for beard and mustache are excellent and there&#x27;s a nose trimmer that works very well.  Being rechargable makes this unit very easy to use.  I would have preferred less hair cutting pieces as they are wasted and take up space.</li>
    <li> I still use it to this day, its been a couple years and it works fine. It is reaching the end of its days though, its having a harder time cutting hair, and ive cleaned it very very well and still just doesn&#x27;t seem like has much life in it. But, for the price and the quality, I totally recommend it to someone looking for a working and affording face trimmer, also works fairly well for shaving your head.</li>
    <li> Main issues:  Cannot operate when plugged in  Trimmer is not wide, is rather narrow  Plastic guides for the beard trimmer are EXTREMELY CHEAP. First the adjustment feature broke off. Next, the teeth started breaking individually. I now must buy a replacement trimmer because Philips norelco didn&#x27;t spend the additional 10cents to make the plastic durable for use. I would NOT buy this or recommend anyone else do so.   The Plastic guards lasted about a year but I may have only used it 30 times to maintain by beard.  The trimming unit itself I had no issues with when it is fully charged.</li>
    <li> With the cost of just about everything on the up, it&#x27;s refreshing to see a top notch manufacturer of personal grooming products like Norelco, giving us a complete kit for relatively little money.&lt;br /&gt;Whether you have facial hair or not, this also makes a great gift for Dad&#x27;s or any ther guy to keep clean and trim.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the attachments are a little fiddly, and might not be so well suited for people with arthritis or difficulty with dexterity, but most will love how easy this is to use.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have a beard only in the winter months, so am looking forward to using this to keep it straight and trimmed up, something I have paid a barber to do in the past. Bearing that in mind, again it&#x27;s going to pay for itself in no time. While I wouldn&#x27;t recommend cutting your own hair (unless you are very talented) this is great for trimming edges, sideburns, and that great fuzzy neck hair (if you&#x27;re old like me) to give you a clean feeling. I&#x27;ve even tidied up the kids hair and loose ends with it too.&lt;br /&gt;Although not applicable in my case, I would imagine with the attachments and versatility of this kit that facial topiary will be easy for those who like to experiment with patterns and styles.&lt;br /&gt;All around a great buy, a great gift, and very good value. 4 Stars</li>
    <li> This grooming set looked like it would be exactly what I needed to trim my goatee and other facial hair. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work all that well.    It comes with a plastic stand, recharging wall wart, and several attachments. Unfortunately, the included instructions, printed roadmap-style on flimsy newsprint (not a good idea for something to be used in a bathroom), are poorly done and very difficult to understand. I have only been able to figure out how to use the shaver and nose hair ripping attachments, and I am still working on decoding the remaining directions to figure out the rest.    The shaver works okay, but is quite under-powered and has trouble even with a medium beard like mine. Perhaps a teenager with very light whiskers, or an old person with very thin hair would find it more useful, but I went right back to my regular blade razor to get a decent shave.    The \\&quot;nose hair ripping attachment,\\&quot; as I call it now, is not gentle or pleasant. I gave up on it after a brief, tear inducing experience. Yanking out nose hairs by hand is less painful. Another disappointment (I won&#x27;t even get it close to my ears.....).    The motor seems under-powered and one must let the battery run all the way down between recharging sessions, as it uses a Nicad battery and has serious problems with \\&quot;memory.\\&quot; Why they use such outdated battery technology is another big question mark. This could easily leave one in \\&quot;mid trim\\&quot; with no way to finish. Hey, maybe they will start a new fad - half-shaved people!    All in all, I was very disappointed with this item and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> After all these years, I have found an all-in-one, clipper system. And it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Shipped to me very quick. Cuts very well, all the attachments seem to work well also, everything looks attractive. This is worth buying!</li>
    <li> My husband says he is satisfied with this product overall.  He has been using it for several weeks and he looks great to me, but he says he wishes it would trim a little shorter.  He says that the guard that determines the length is \\&quot;pretty lame.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it and uses it frequently for beard, mustache, and nose trimming. It has been a great gift for him. Easily cleaned, nicely kept organized for sink top, and looks great sitting out.</li>
    <li> The grooming kit is very handy and does a good job of trimming. The sharp edges are best handled by this. If you are cutting long hair be ready to clean the blades in short intervals.    Charging for 10 hours for a 35 min run is the only down side of this.</li>
    <li> I have owned three other trimmers from Norelco. They all worked well except the battery dies and then you end up throwing them. Now I bought T980 which works while it is plugged in also. So if its battery dies, it will continue to be useful.    G480, however, is bad product overall. It trims reasonable well IF you can figure out how to use the length control plastic part.  When used directly on the skin as in shave mode, it pulls hair instead of cutting them.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find the right electric razor for a while.  Between not getting what I want and losing the chargers, I just about gave up.  Then I got this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor looked a little dainty and breakable at first glance.  This is not the case.  The casing is sturdy, as are the interchangeable blades, which are easy to remove and click into place.  The guards are quite useful, though it may have more than you will ever use.  I find myself only using one, but it is nice to have the options.  The stand holds everything in one small footprint; if you get into the habit of placing the bits in the stand, you never lose them, which is great.  The place for the shaver itself is where it charges as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One amazing thing to mention would be the usage per charge.  I have charged this unit once since I got it months ago, and have yet to lose any power.  Beyond what I mentioned above, this is a huge selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with this purchase, and would recommend this to anyone without hesitation.</li>
    <li> After giving up on the weak Panasonic ER415 trimmer, I decided to try the Norelco G480.  I should have never wasted my $10 on the Panasonic.  For an extra $15, this product is vastly superior in quality and options.  I like that I can charge this product vs. ones that are only battery operated.  It also has the flexibility of changing the attachments for different grooming needs.  Nice!  For trimming hair where it doesn&#x27;t belong, this product does it right!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for Hubby after his other one disappeared a bit ago.  We are very satisfied with all the included attachments; especially at the 29 dollar price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand that is included is a great investment on its own because it keeps all those little pieces organized.  The base even allows for the recharging cord to be looped through an opening in the back.  Luckily, we have a spot on our medicine cabinet to hold this.  It is rather bulky, but you have to take the fact that it is holding all the attachments into consideration.  The pieces are plastic and if misused/handled I can see them cracking in the future.  The actual shaver is very slim and light-weight which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know that it isn&#x27;t an actual full hair cutting implement, but we were able to successfully cut my husband&#x27;s hair and shape.  He has course bushy hair and he was able to bring it all the way down.  It took him a few minutes to understand how the numbers worked on this particular set and once he started he got through it without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t tried the ear and nose trimmer because he is fearful of the other reviews stating that it hurts.  Highly recommend, because it shapes and trims flawlessly and was able to give a haircut.  The battery life leaves something to be desired, with a 10 hr charge giving you 35 minutes of work time.  You will have to be quick because there isn&#x27;t a way to just plug it in and keep on going.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every attachment and it all seems to work well. Adjustment of the guard may not be as good as others I&#x27;ve owned but its half the cost. I did find that the mini screen shaver doesn&#x27;t do a lot but I&#x27;m more partial to using a shick quatrro shaver. The battery life so far seems to be great. After the initial charge it didn&#x27;t need to be charged for a month and a half. I use it to shave my beard about 2 times a week and trim whole body twice a month. Its very light and compact. Great for travel if you just need to stick the trimmer in your suitcase. I wouldn&#x27;t charge it all the time though. It seems to be setup to promote this with the charger fitting into the bottom of the base. Don&#x27;t charge after every use, just wait for it to run down. You will start to get a sign of a slowing motor before it completely dies so if you pay attention you won&#x27;t get stuck with a half shaven face and a dead battery. Would defiantly buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tray is a little flimsy FYI. It works, but if you just barely bump it things go everywhere. I think a nice hard case would have been 10x better. No one really wants this thing out for display at all times! Mine is in the closet on a shelf.</li>
    <li> The product is great especially given the price. You can charge it and there are no hassles of replacing batteries every other week. The case is not that great though and I dont use it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is pretty good, the attachments break very easily. I bought this shaver from London drugs (Canada) for 27.50 not on sale, a good deal for that price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try one of these kits for years. My husband has short hair and needs to keep it neatly trimmed for work, so he&#x27;s always running to the barber for a trim and we have teenage boys, although only one of them has short enough hair for me to use this on. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It includes a large trimmer that&#x27;s perfect for cutting hair, which has nine length settings which gives you a nice variety of lengths.  It also includes a beard/moustache/eyebrow trimmer, a nose and ear hair trimmer, a precision detailing cutter, a mini shaver, a nice stand and a cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never cut hair before and was a little scared to try but my husband graciously agreed to be my first victim...um I mean client. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was remarkably easy. I cut his hair, trimmed his sideburns and around his ears and even cleaned up the back of his neck in under 20 minutes and it looked like he just came back from the barber. We were both impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $15 a haircut this will pay for itself in no time and the other attachments all worked well too. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about this product.  Well worth the money I spent on it:)</li>
    <li> This is one of the fastest way to do a touch up to a full haircut and to trim your beard with all the different attachment where ever you are, In the car or in the office since it holds a Charge for a very long Time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with mine so far.  It&#x27;s easy to use and quite versatile but watch out for the nose hair trimmer.  I find that it more often pulls than cuts.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> Overall, the product is very good, it does the job well, the only problem I have had is the battery life, intruction&#x27;s manual says you need to charge it for full 10 hours after discharging it completely only to last approx. 35 mins working and since it doesn&#x27;t come with a battery level indicator you never know exactly when batteries are running out.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the money. The stand actually holds all the peices very well. I do not like that the stand has a curved back.</li>
    <li> I really think that it&#x27;s a very good product, easy to handle and it have met my expectations. Be cool to get one!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at july/2011, the trimmer work fine, but the adapter(charger)is dead while using, just dead without reason.......you know, and without the adapter the trimmer no work any more althought it&#x27;s new still......</li>
    <li> OK, I have waited 18 months to write this review.  So, this isn&#x27;t one of those \\&quot;I&#x27;ve opened the package and it looks great\\&quot;-type reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This grooming kit really does have everything you need and the battery life is incredible. Each month I use the groomer to cut my hair (which is much thinned as a result of age).  I use it four times a month to trim my mustache.  And I use it occasionally to touch up what my blade-shave did not quite do as well as it should have.  I have recharged it three times in the 18 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various attachments are adjustable and the various grooming heads cover a wide range of needs.  This unit feels good in the hand and is light enough to easily manipulate, but heavy enough to feel substantial.  The quality is excellent and it was well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Does the job, great for its price. It&#x27;s requires a bit of work to get a really close shave (shaving with at least two different trimmer heads if you have a moderate beard) but it does achieve a close shave, at least the best I have experienced with this type of machines.</li>
    <li> Great product until one or more of the fragile teeth break on the hair trimmer comb-I used mine weekly for 18 months and and is now obsolete since the hair trimmer comb is discontinued! Replaced comb previously.</li>
    <li> I found the Phillips Norelco All-in-One an invaluable tool to groom my moustache, goatee &amp; patch.  Great for eyebrow trimming (for those of us over 40). Good value for the money, and I wish I had purchased it sooner.  Only drawback is that a charge does not last as long as the manufacturer claims.</li>
    <li> Unlike my Phillips razor, this trimmer is made in China. The quality of the plastic is so poor...  the little dimple on the trimmer, which is used to set the length of the cut on the attachments broke the attachment the first time I installed it!</li>
    <li> My son had bought one of the Norelco groomers and I had tried it a couple times and just Loved it. I bought this one and its great I would recommend it to my family and friends. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> After dropping my last beard trimmer I needed a new one.  I read the reviews, checked prices, and this one was right.  So far, trimming my beard, and even my nose hair has been painless.  Using this razor is simple and straight forward.  My only 2 cons would be the base has no weight to it and the method that the charger cable plugs in from the base seems a bit counter intuitive.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that the previous model of this All-in-one lasted more and was more effective. this one sure looks fancy but doesn&#x27;t last long. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the set again, I&#x27;ll look for something more durable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for about 4 months now.  I maintain a full beard and mostly use the beard trimmer, and smaller trimming tools for nose, mustache, sculpting, etc.  I do use the microscreen from time to time, but as others have said, it&#x27;s not as efficient as full-on microscreen shavers.  It&#x27;s a nice addition to an already solid kit, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that.  I still use a regular razor for clean shaving around my beard (neck/face).    I shave roughly 1-2 times a week to keep my beard in good shape and from becomming too shaggy.  I have not had to recharge the unit since the first time I used it months ago.  The cutters do a good job on 1 or 2 passes - I don&#x27;t need to go over the same area over and over to catch all the hairs.  The blades move fast enough for this purpose.  There are a lot of length settings (9), but I stick to the #2 length.  My only complaint here is that it&#x27;s a little too easy to press down on the plastic guard and end up with a #1 setting, giving you a very five o&#x27; clock shadow look.  I&#x27;ve done this once but now I pay closer attention and make sure the length setting is locked in a little better.  The lock is just a plastic tab, so it&#x27;s a little too easy to move around, you just can&#x27;t be overly brutal with it.      The other attachments work just as well as the beard trimmer.  Swapping the heads out is very easy - it really couldn&#x27;t be easier.  I have used the hair attachment once to even out a rugged haircut as well - works just as good as the others.  I was suprised that I found myself using this feature - i guess not having it before I never thought I would use it, but I appreciated the fact that I could!    Everything cleans up really easy with a few taps to knock out the excess hair, and a quick rinse for everything else.  The unit is extremely lightweight, not very loud, and very confortable to use.    Honestly, the price is the kicker here - it&#x27;s a very well-performing shaver/trimmer for all that you get.  All but the microscreen are just fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t look for a super-clean shave with the microscreen, however.  The tray that comes with the kit is a nice addition - it keeps everything neat and tidy.  There is one less &#x27;spot&#x27; for all the heads vs. what you get, but I think it&#x27;s expected that you will leave the main head attached when it is stored, which I would recommend.    I am happy with this product - the only downside is the ease at which you can move the length adjustment, it takes a little tweaking to get it to be secure enough not to have to pay close attention while shaving.  All in all, I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high hopes after having owned a Braun hair trimmer for the better part o 13 years, I guess I kindda thought hair trimmers were safe buys. This product has many GRAVE issues for the average user, mainly:    1. If you leave it charging for any period of time (over a few hours, not specific) like you would any other battery loaded device in the world (Read Iphone, Braun hair trimmer, electric tooth brush) the battery will become unable to hold a charge and you will be shaving in four second intervals. This information is HIDDEN in the fine print of the manual. I have been using electronics for decades and I have never encountered such a product, they could spend 15 cents and make it so it automatically stops charging or something, instead of becoming ruined.    2. The device will not run when plugged in, therefore, if the battery craps out on you as described above, well then you are SOL and JWF.    Unless you are willing to CLOSELY MONITOR this products charge cycles, I would recommend ANY OTHER hair trimmer.    It&#x27;s a poorly thought out, very idiotically designed product.</li>
    <li> Not too sure about quality but it gets the job done for general grooming and trimming.  A little cheap and plastic-y but can&#x27;t complain for the price.  Would recommend for occasional grooming and touch ups.  If you have thick hair or use it a ton I would spend the extra money on something else.</li>
    <li> Great all-in-one razor. Works well on curves of the face, trims thick hair and has several adjustments for ears,nose, or thick beard. Even tried it on eyebrows and worked! Absolutely love this razor, especially since im so cheap :D</li>
    <li> 11am put on charger  10:30pm try to make first cut  10:50pm battery discharged  IT IS NOT WORKING WITH PLUGGED IN CHARGER!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this kit! It&#x27;s got everything you can need and does an excellent job!      THANKS ,    Chris G</li>
    <li> Good grooming kit, much better than the old Remington I used to have. All the attachments that it comes really make it an all in one kit for most uses. I love the fact that it is made by Philips/Norelco, Ive yet to have one piece of electronic Ive bought from Philips fail eg. my Sonicare toothbrush has lasted years. It comes with a charger with decent battery life and its cordless which is really convenient, no batteries to replace or cords getting in the way. If I had to nitpick though I would say the stand is a bit cheap, the attachments do not fit snug on the stand so depending on where its placed it can get knocked over very easily. Not a big deal though, overall I am satisfied and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good grooming kit, providing lots of options with high-quality blades and numerous attachments. I used the beard trimmer and was pleased, ditto with the nose-hair trimmer, which worked well when applied with a light touch -- no tugging or pulling, and the blade is kept well away fron your skin, so no cuts or blade burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides to the product (in its current incarnation) are mainly cosmetic, and not related to the hardware itself. Most noticeably, it takes up a lot of shelf space -- surface area, to be precise -- with a plastic stand that eats up an area of about 8x4 inches, a lot of room for anyone sharing a bathroom with others. Also, the plastic base is surprisingly flimsy and easy to tip over -- if it were of heavier material, or if it were redesigned so that it could hang from a wall, it might be more utile. The documentation needs work as well - numerous pages that are visually almost identical, number sequences that are too-frequently repeated  (the numbers 1-10 used several times for different purposes) and an old-fashioned fold-out format that makes it difficult to hold, or to find specific information.  Both of these are problems that don&#x27;t directly reflect on the product itself -- a redesign of both would be relatively easy and could greatly enhance the overall product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I&#x27;m happy with the shaves and trims I&#x27;ve gotten using this kit... In fact, I&#x27;ve never looked foxier!  Rrrrrrrowllll!</li>
    <li> This is my second beard trimmer as my last one would no longer hold a charge and required constant oiling.  This trimmer from Phillips Norelco appears to solve both of these problems.  First of all, the exterior packaging is attractive with lots of shiny blue and silver and a even a qualified claim that its blades are sharper than titanium.  Opening up the box led to my first disappointment however.  The trimmer was completely enclosed in that annoying packaging that requires cutting around the entire edge with scissors rather than being able to tear right into it.  Nobody likes that packaging.  Once I got the package open the components were pretty easy to put together.  The base holds all of the attachments but rather loosely so it&#x27;s not really portable.  I left the trimmer to charge overnight which is easy to do once you run the wire into the base.  There are 8 attachments and I will address each of them in turn.         Full size trimmer:  The standard attachment, works well for my regular hair trimming applications.  It has a strange concave shape that I&#x27;m not sure serves a purpose, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t detract from its performance.         Nose, ear, and eyebrow trimmer:  I don&#x27;t really have unruly ear hair or eyebrows but I figured I give my nose a trim.  This attachment worked well enough.  Not much to say other than yes, it made my nose hair shorter.         Mini shaver:  Worthless.  I used it on 4 days growth with no effect.  I took the full size trimmer to shorten it up and went at it again.  After about 20 passes with the shaver, there were uneven patches of somewhat shorter hair, but nowhere near as nice as a dedicated electric shaver.         Detailing blade:  I didn&#x27;t use this.  The box indicates that it can be used to shave lightning bolts into your hair.  I&#x27;ll take their word for it, I just don&#x27;t have a use for a detailing blade, I guess.         Precision trimmer:  Just like the full size trimmer, but smaller.  I used this on my sideburn area,just like the full sized one.  It worked just as well, so if I had a need for a smaller trimmer, I could see myself using this more often.            The 3 combs:  I will address all of these at once because they are essentially the same.  They attach to the trimmer (the eyebrow comb requires the precision trimmer) and adjust based on a system of arbitrary numbers for the desired length.  I was able to quickly and evenly trim my very coarse beard.  This is what I needed this trimmer for and it does the job perfectly.  When I get older and my eyebrows get all bushy I guess I&#x27;ll give the eyebrow comb a try, but as of now, I still don&#x27;t need it.  Also, my days of cutting my own hair are behind me, but if I ever feel the need, this trimmer appears to be up for the job.         Overall, this unit is a perfectly functional trimmer for all of my needs.  It is not everything it claims to be, but if you can do without a shaver, you will be pleasantly surprised.  The box claims a battery life of 35 minutes and that seems good enough as I was not able to run it down throughout all of these tests.  Also, the manufacturer claims no oil is necessary so I&#x27;m curious to see how this holds up for the long haul.  If you&#x27;re in the market for a versatile hair trimmer, look no further than the Norelco All in 1 Grooming Kit.</li>
    <li> The battery in the razor of my current grooming kit had just about reached the end of its&#x27; functional life span so the opportunity to get this Norelco unit was greatly appreciated. I&#x27;ve worn beards for variable interludes over the last thirty years and I&#x27;ve destroyed more groomers than I care to remember but without question this kit is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit includes five separate heads: full sized trimmer, nose and ear groomer, shaver and two smaller heads for precision work. It also has three guard attachments that easily slide over the trimmer heads  and each comb/guard attachment has 9 settings to allow the user to define precise cutting lengths. Unlike my current unit where the plastic comb heads have some sort of flimsy hook that seemed to be designed to break off after a few uses, this arrangement  is both durable and secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed others have commented that the shaver seems underpowered but I have found it more than adequate to trim my beard, the aggravating little hairs of the nostrils, ears and those eyebrow follicles with a mind of their own.  I would not suggest attempting to use this unit as a primary shaver. As groomers go, I do not find it to be particularly noisy and certainly not anymore irritating to the skin than other models, for those who have become accustomed to using electric or rechargeable units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a typical rechargeable unit, it is incumbent to unplug it in between recharging sessions. Unfortunately, due to the design of the stand the cord itself is not easily removable once it is lodged in the base so the contact point could be damaged over time.  A couple of nice features are the ease of cleaning - just wash out with hot running tap water - and the minimal lubrication needs. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times with past shavers I forgotten to oil the blades and ended up with screeching/grinding units that eventually failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor complaint is the lack of a remaining charge time indicator lamp. It is suggested that the user completely drain the battery before recharging but unless you are a lot more cognizant of total usage times than me, chances are the charge will run out mid-process at some point. A full charge cycle takes ten hours and that is expected to provide about 35 minutes of shave time.sted that the user completely drain the battery before recharging but unless you are a lot more cognizant of total usage times than me, chances are the charge will run out mid-process at some point.

    <li> This little trimming tool set is a pretty good deal for the price - nothing too fancy and it should do pretty well under normal conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer is sharp and quick - I had to straighten mine up before a job interview this week and I was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer merely snags the nose hairs and pulls them out by the roots. I&#x27;ve never used a nose hair trimmer before so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal or not. I doubt I&#x27;ll use it again since it was such an eye-watering experience.  Instead, I used a tiny version of the sideburn trimmer and literally trimmed those wild hairs in my nostrils.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical when I first opened the box. The trimmer is made of lightweight plastic. The housings around the cutting blades were falling off. The tray for holding the various parts is too large and I had no room for it. The different cutting heads didn&#x27;t fit tightly in the tray and rattled around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged the cutter but wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Boy was I surprised. The trimmer cuts effortlessly. This clipper cut better than any I&#x27;ve ever had a barber use on me. A light touch and the hair is gone. The cutting system is almost foolproof and so very easy to use because of it&#x27;s simple design.  When using the combs there&#x27;s no need to go over the same areas again and again. It&#x27;s simple, quick, and efficient even with no hair cutting experience. It&#x27;s worth twice the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using a Conair hair trimmer to cut my own hair, so when the Vine program offered this, I was really excited.  On first receiving it, I had my doubts--it&#x27;s narrower than your average hair trimmer, the battery life is only 35 minutes, and it can&#x27;t be used plugged into the wall.  However, after a full charge, this thing cut my hair in half the time my Conair does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the secret is the tiny blades--they don&#x27;t get catch the hair awkwardly like others do, and they are really sharp!  Although the attachments look fragile and cheap, the size adjustment apparatus works well and easily, and changing the heads is also easy.  The only thing that&#x27;s really cheap is the stand, which does little to hold the attachments in place, but it&#x27;s a pretty minor problem.  Both of the smaller heads and attachments work well for sculpting lines and trimming eyebrows/sideburns/beards, and I tried the nosehair trimmer for fun (don&#x27;t really have nosehair problems) and it seemed to do the job, although it tickled a bit.  The only warning I have for potential users is that the tiny blades CAN cut your skin if you&#x27;re not careful non-level areas--I got \\&quot;bit\\&quot; on the ear accidentally, so you have to avoid pushing very hard at all.  Other than that, this is a zippy little kit and one that I would definitely pay the rather modest price to own.</li>
    <li> NOTE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use all of the attachments in this grooming kit. I only used the beard and nose trimmer attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s perhaps the best most affordable grooming kit you&#x27;ll be able to find.&lt;br /&gt;2) The beard attachment is great. I have been using it for years and it still works fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The nose trimmer attachment doesn&#x27;t work well. However, Philips Norelco does have a very good nose trimmer that I have used for years with no problems at all. Look for Philips Norelco NT9110 here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This worked for me pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I do my hair cut myself and i trim it very short.&lt;br /&gt;I use different setting (size) in different region for the head.say, size 6 in the top and 4 in the sides and size 2 in the back...this works well and easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> Not much to say besides this kit just works.  I&#x27;ve had probably 5~6 different sets like this over the years and this one is just as good as all the others like it.  I use it every day and it so far has stayed nice and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it a 4 because the stand is a bit large compared to other ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> Over the years, doodles on the Google homepage have made searching on Google more fun and enjoyable for its users worldwide. When doodles were first created, nobody had anticipated how popular and integral they would become to the Google search experience. Nowadays, many users excitedly anticipate the release of each</li>
    <li> This product is alright. My boyfriend&#x27;s face is pretty smooth...but not as smooth as we&#x27;d both like. It causes a bit of irritation, and a couple of the razor heads are difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as the rechargeable Philips shaver that lasted me over 10 years, before the battery stopped recharging, but not bad for the price.  The attachments dont feel very solid and seem like they can break easily.  Its nice to have the different attachments, especially the nose hair, all on one machine.  The base is a little a little cheesy, I am not trying to display my shaver and attachments to the world, they could have made it more compact and sturdy, but then it probably wouldnt be as inexpensive.  For a cheap shaver that works decent, this does the job.</li>
    <li> my hubby loves this thing!</li>
    <li> After spending a half an hour getting this thing out of the box, I was ready to try it out.  Then I read that you have to charge it for 10 hours in order to get 35 min. of use. Weird, but whatever, I&#x27;ll try it.  12 hours later, I eagerly went to use it, and when I turned it on, it ran for about 4 seconds and pooped out.  I thought, maybe I did something wrong, so I checked all the instructions, plugged it in on a different outlet and...NOTHING! That&#x27;s O.K., I didn&#x27;t really want to rip out my nose hairs anyway.</li>
    <li> Great product so far but it feels a little bit cheap.  And the plastic height selector its too weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However its powerful enough for the job.  I use it to cut my hair and works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life its ok.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance&#x27;.  He is VERY picky with what type of razor he uses.  His broke so I had to buy him a new one.  This is the one I went with and he said that he loves it.  He now has a close shave everytime I touch his face.    Great products.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> 5+ years and this set still goes strong. Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> needs to be charged constantly and the combs break to easily</li>
    <li> Some of the smaller plastic pieces broke after a couple months. The shaver holds charge well and works fine but I can only use about half of the accessories now.</li>
    <li> This groomer is much nicer than I expected. A lot better than another brand that I finally wore out.</li>
    <li> i bought this because i wanted to be able to groom in many different ways&lt;br /&gt;this worked well because there was so many tops that i could switch onto the trimmer. also the battery lasts a long time after you charge it&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend buying this item to everyone who is annoyed with there groomer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a year now. At first it worked nice, nothing special, but after 1 year:  1) One full charge keeps only about one-two uses.  2) The blades are not sharp anymore. Actually, they state that \\&quot;designed to give you unprecedented precision\\&quot; - it didn&#x27;t for me, however, it does work in a so-so way, meaning, it cuts but not to high precision.    One serious drawback - it doesn&#x27;t work while charging.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the manufacturers website stating that the product was capable of being used overseas.  One of the assets advertised for the product wss that it was multi-voltage capable, i.e. it could be charged using 120-240 volts.  The product clearly does not support this capability.  When I called the Philips Norelco product service site I was told that they were very sorry that what was advertised was not true but there was nothing they could do about it. In short it was my problem and they were not going to do anything to straighten out the situation.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a set mostly for trimming, so not really much heavy use on it as stated in some other reviews the product does seem like its lacking in power but for the amount of time i have used it its been quite good to me. Whats made me want to throw the product out the window though is the charger, after some time i put the trimmer to charge and saw that the red light that comes on didn&#x27;t and the product isn&#x27;t charging and now i cant use my product 20 dollar waste? then i found my old Nokia phone charger and tried to charge it with that, albeit the Nokia chargers output is 5v whilst the Norelcos is 1.6v so maybe thats it, but again to no avail, so now i don&#x27;t know whether its the product or the charger or even both, so in hopes that its only the charger i ordered the G370 I&#x27;m guessing the earlier product in this line and hoping for the best with that. I realize it would be simpler to buy a charger online and see if it works but seeing the price for the charger id rather buy this product again the charger is about the same as the product at $[...] plus shipping, I could look for alternative chargers *sighs* but i think ill try my luck with the G370.    EDIT: So the G370 came (the product looks and feels much better than the G480 BTW) and i used the charger on my G480 and it works fine so it was the charger that was messed up.</li>
    <li> Bought this back in Aug 2011.  Almost one year and has been very reliable.  Have used it for hair trimming, beard/stache trimming and nose/ear trimming.  No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sits nicely in a tight space out of wife&#x27;s way in bathroom.  Have only had to charge to product twice.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t an expensive set, and considering it&#x27;s affordability I don&#x27;t really have anything negative to say about it. But I should mention that I am simply not an overly hairy guy.  I even brought that up in a separate review I wrote for another excellent Norelco product, because I can understand guys with more excessive beard growth will could have a different perspective.      I found everything in this set does the job it is intended for.  I like the ability to charge it up and found that it holds the charge for roughly a half hour of cordless use, as advertised.  In fact, rather than list a bunch of info readily available in the product description I will just reiterate that this entire set seems to operate exactly as promised. I found it most useful for the hair clipper comb, which is easy to use and really worthwhile to avoid having to pay at a haircut place for a slight trim. The multiple positions - nine of them - make it pretty much impossible to screw up your hair (at least as I&#x27;ve experienced so far!).  I don&#x27;t need an eyebrow trimmer (my eyebrows aren&#x27;t very bushy) - nor a nosehair trimmer (I just think it&#x27;s easier to yank those annoying suckers out without a special device).  So I can&#x27;t speak on the effectiveness of those features.      The product looks great in the included storage stand.  I honestly have no reservations in recommending this product.  I&#x27;m a pretty low-maintenance guy overall, I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the mirror fretting over every detail of \\&quot;my look.\\&quot;  That might be why I&#x27;m not pickier about these types of products. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with being &#x27;metro&#x27; or whatever. Just saying that I&#x27;m not into shaping my facial hair into unusual designs or patterns - and if you happen to be, you might be a little nitpickier over the functionality of this set.</li>
    <li> I love this set of trimmers that have parts to de-hair almost all the parts you may have!&lt;br /&gt;I trim nearly everywhere,and this set makes grooming pleasant and exciting!&lt;br /&gt;I use it as often as I can as it works well and cleans up with ease.&lt;br /&gt;A modern set for the modern man!</li>
    <li> i feel complete with this system. Everything is excellent except the nose trimmers, but i was not really interested in that anyway. The gaurds an razors witht this system make grooming very easy and professional. I can keep my face, hair, eyebrows and underarms trimmed and clean. No problems at all</li>
    <li> Alright. I had to buy this one, since my old Norelco took a puke after 10 years. This trimmer is a great performer. Very quick and concise work of all trimming you must do. Especially liked the micro shaver, so that I can get in close to the beard line. My beard trimming has taken on a whole new experince with this guy. I especially liked the nose and ear hair trimmer. I have felt a couple of tugs at the little guys, but considering I used to tweeze them, this makes nose trimming a vacation! The accessory tray is nice, but could use a better way of keeeping all the attachments in one place. One little kniock and you are chasing trimmer heads all over the room. Not that big of a deal and has no effect on the rating. The bad part is, and this is why I am only rating it 3 stars, battery life. You have to charge it for 10 hours for 35 min. of trimming. Huh?!!!! That is ridiculous!!! I have a hand crank emergency radio with noaa, weather radio, am/fm, emergency light, noise maker and get this, a cell phone charger, that lasts for 30 min. after 15 sec. of cranking. I don&#x27;t get it. Really, I don&#x27;t. The instructions tell you in order for the trimmer to keep it&#x27;s memory it must remain off the charger in between charging, but it will die on you in the middle of any trimming, and you now have to charge it. It will leave you with half of a clean face and beard. My job requires 100% out of me, and I expect the same from the items I purchase. If I do half of my job, it reflects poorly of me. This one issue, tells me numerous things about the designers and engineers working at Norelco. They should have made a better battery to go with such a good trimmer. So, all-in-all, if you need a trimmer for Grizzly Adams and the stragglers, I would recommend this one, but I would warn anybody regarding the battery life.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and within about 7 weeks, all the attachments are broken and he doesn&#x27;t even use it every day.  He liked the variety of the trimmers, but didn&#x27;t really like the shaver results either.</li>
    <li> This thing is good, but wore out pretty fast and you couldn&#x27;t keep the depth of cut set. It would slip all the way down. $749.99 is ridiculous as mine was $24.99 and it is the same one. These people need to be banned from selling anything.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with the Norelco G480.  Make sure to be careful with the plastic guards as they are fragile, but I&#x27;ve had it for several months and it has not broken yet.  The guards are still usable even if you do break off piece.  A fully charged battery will last for a long time.  At least a full week of shaves, and probably a lot longer.  It actually has not died on me during a shave and I rarely ever charge it.  The accessories are accurate and cover almost all grooming situations.  The nose clipper is a bit of a nuisance to use but all nose clippers are.  I simply use the small detailing piece for nose hairs and it works perfectly (no tickling or painful removal). Excellent product overall.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item just a little over 18 months ago. During it&#x27;s short lifetime, it was merely ok as a trimmer. Overall, I feel that it is cheaply made. About 9 months in, one of the trimmer guides broke, and while it was still useable, it was uncomfortable to use, as the broken tine would occasionally catch on my face. I was able to use another of the included guides so I didn&#x27;t bother to return the item. This week, the battery was in need of a charge, so I, as usual plugged it in, expecting that by the next day, it would be ready to go. No such luck. I left it again over night and it was still not taking a charge. The trimmer is well out of warranty, so I am left to shop for another.</li>
    <li> Well, this is not something that will last you for a while. I used it for about four months, and then I threw it away. It&#x27;s not good for thick hair - just not powerful enough.</li>
    <li> I have been buying grooming products for over 15 years, and this is by far the best and easiest to use.  Great value for the money!</li>
    <li> Its a good product from Philips. using this since 2 months never faced any issues with this. i like this product</li>
    <li> This is a great little set, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  It&#x27;s not as powerful as some of the trimmers out there, and it&#x27;s not going to replace a shaver, but for most people it should be able to handle everything you throw at it.  I&#x27;ll review each component here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer - This is what you onto.  It&#x27;s decently powered, but battery life is short (only about 30 minutes!).  It was better than expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mini Shaver - I can&#x27;t really say I recommend shaving with this.  If you need a quick light shave at the last minute, it&#x27;s ok.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it regularly to shave or for a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mustache, eyebrow, and clipper combs - While they&#x27;re labeled for separate parts of your face,  these are basically like the combs you see on haircutters or beard and mustache groomers.  They attach to the trimmer and can be used to trim your beard, mustache, eyebrows, whatever.  You could even give yourself an impromptu haircut if you wanted, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  They work fine but feel a bit flimsy when attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nose/ear trimmer - Works great for removing random hairs that show up in the wrong places, needed a new one after my old one died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;precision trimmer - This is the tool for your sideburns.  Easy to use and works great at catching all the hairs in a couple of swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;fine detailing\\&quot; blade - I think this is what you use for the \\&quot;pencil thin beard\\&quot; or shaving a logo onto the back of your head.  I probably won&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stand - This neatly holds each attachment and even charges the trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t look bad in a bathroom at all, and keeps you from losing track of everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: A nice little set at a decent price.  Considering a dedicated unit for any single item here would cost at least twenty bucks, I can handle the fact that I may only use half of the attachments.  Battery life is a bit short, but if you&#x27;re using this for more than 30 minutes at a time you may have a problem to begin with.  Overall I think the set is a great buy and should be able to tackle most grooming issues in conjunction with a separate shaver.hink the set is a great buy and should be able to tackle most grooming issues in conjunction with a separate shaver.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Remington grooming kit with this Norelco G480.  The Norelco is a superior product.  It provides the precision needed for trimming your beard, has useful shaver and hair trimming attachments, and preforms very well.  There are several height settings, and they are clearly explained in the documentation, so you can get easily get the results you desire.    The nose hair trimmer is a bit bulky (the Panasonic battery operated unit I have does a better job), but Norelco&#x27;s attachment works pretty well (the Remington&#x27;s attachment was useless).    This kit takes up a lot of space if you leave it on your counter, but stows easily in a drawer. Battery life is good, and it is recommended that you do not charge it continuously, so it is not necessary to keep the groomer near an outlet at all times.    Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> We know there&#x27;s a well-groomed thoroughbred hiding somewhere under all that stubble...the Philips Norelco Grooming Kit, G-480 makes it easy to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco Grooming Kit, G-480, has a handy storage and charging stand. It is versatile with it&#x27;s 3-trimmer pieces, 3-combs, a fine detailing blade and a mini shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dad:  \\&quot;The Full Size Trimmer Blade trimmed my beard and moustache evenly using it with the easy to attach 9-position comb. The Precision Trimmer was excellent for closer beard and moustache hair detailing with the 4-position comb. The Ear, Nose and Eyebrow Trimmer, Mini Shaver and Fine Detailing Blade worked well around my other face and neck areas. The pieces are easily interchangeable from the Trimmer Handle by just pulling them off and putting them on for quick attention to the needy areas of the face, neck and head. I didn&#x27;t use the hair comb, yet, as I didn&#x27;t need a trim.  It&#x27;s a confidence builder, as I can \\&quot;Do It Myself!\\&quot;  Think of the Money I will Save!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and, You Look Like a $Million$, Dad!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2008</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco G480 All in One Premium Grooming Kit is a wonderful, jam-packed kit for the men in our life!  (Okay, so I used it too!)  It includes a full-sized trimmer, charger/storage stand, mini-shaver, moustache comb, clipper comb, nose trimmer, precision trimmer, fine detailing blade, and eyebrow comb.  And everything rinses clean with no oiling!!  (A huge plus for this gal&#x27;s man!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for quite some time now - and this was so very simple to use and got the job done effectively and neatly!  I loved it!  And with just a rinse under the sink it was clean!  Loved that too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby tested it on eyebrows, goatee (sp), mustache, etc - and gave it 2 thumbs up!  (I may have also tested on my legs - but don&#x27;t tell him!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this kit!  It&#x27;s got everything you can need and does an excellent job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 1smileycat :-)</li>
    <li> This grooming kit is perfect for routine, touch up trimming between haircuts.  It has a large number of attachments all that I have used work exactly as they should. It will trim hair in or around the nose, ears, eyebrows, sideburns, etc.  There are three different adjustable guards which minimize the chance of making a mistake on eyebrows or trimming beards.  The stand is OK, but I have to hold the stand down with one hand to remove the device.  The stand is too light and the device holds too strongly to the charger plug.  If you try to remove it will not release from the stand and the attachments will end up all over the floor.  I have not used the small foil shaver attachment, though I worry that it would be difficult to clean.  Overall, it is a good value and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is a all inclusive grooming kit. Recommend this be used for every day maintenance or when needed. It is for touch up use. If you use it for that, then 4 stars. This is a reasonable cost item and you can pay much more for more exact benefits. However, I did much research on an easy way to adhoc grooming. I chose this brand as oppose to other off-brands. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I am sorry for taking so long to write the review for the Philips Norelco G480 All-In-One Grooming Kit, but it takes time to grow hair with which to evaluate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, about me and my intended use.  I am an adult male with male pattern baldness.  I do not wear facial hair (intentionally).  Some years ago, I realized that I was paying a barber $9 plus tip to run clippers over what remains of my hair, not to mention that the trip to the barbershop ruined an otherwise free day.  I went in search of clippers and bought a Remington model.  Recently, my wife has commented that the aging Remington was not cutting so well, so when Amazon Vine offered me this grooming kit, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression taking it out of the box was, \\&quot;This is small.\\&quot;  The width of the widest clipper blade is 1-1/4 in (22 mm) while that of my Remington is 1-3/4 in (45 mm), so I&#x27;m going to need more passes to cut my hair with the Norelco.  One that was hard to tell from the description was that the G480 comes not only with several attachments, but with interchangeable heads.  There are three clipper heads, a razor head and a nose/ear trimmer head.  In a similar vein, the razor head on the G480 is only 11/16 in (17 mm) while a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; electric razor that I have is 1-3/4 in (45 mm) wide.  So it is probably not the best thing for regular shaving.  Although the manual mentions using the G480 for cutting hair, I quickly formed the impression that this outfit was intended primarily for maintenance of facial hair.  I&#x27;d given up electric razors years ago for straight blades, so I won&#x27;t use the razor (not that it&#x27;s very usable anyway).  One item that I may find useful is the nose/ear hair clipper, although it takes some practice guiding the tool around in an effective manner, and I found that it kind of yanks the hairs when it finds one.  Not always pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the multiple heads, the G480 comes with three adjustable-length clipper combs.  My first impression was that they seemed somewhat flimsy.  They shouldn&#x27;t see a lot of force, however (unless you drop them).  They also do not have the hair length marked in familiar units - just arbitrary numbers.  Not too bad once you figure out that \\&quot;6\\&quot; gives you a similar cut as a ½ in guide on other clippers.  One behavior that may be viewed as either a feature or an annoyance is that most of the cut hair collects in the comb.  The hair doesn&#x27;t fall on the floor, but you may have to stop frequently to empty it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main feature of the Norelco that sets this apart from my previous clippers is that it is cordless.  The G480 was light and had plenty of power for any job that I threw at it.  I have cut my hair with it three or four times and used it a few times for other trimming before it died and required recharging.  On the downside, the instructions tell you to completely drain the battery before recharging to avoid memory problems with the battery.  I thought modern batteries had all gotten past this need.  This could be somewhat annoying when the battery dies halfway through shaving off your beard.  The charger is a \\&quot;wall wart\\&quot; transformer, cord and small plug that plugs into the base of the clippers.  The plug fits into the storage base in such a way that placing the clippers in the base automatically plugs in the charger.  Of course, since you&#x27;re not supposed to leave it on the charger except when it is completely dead, this feature is somewhat dubious.  It might be better to just leave the charger in a drawer until needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco G480 thoughtfully comes with a plastic storage base that holds the clippers, as mentioned, as well as all of the heads and combs.  If your bathroom sink is anything like mine (and my current bathroom has a large his and hers double sink), it quickly clutters up with things, and this base takes quite some space.  Also, the heads are not secured into their shallow recesses at all, so the lightest jarring of the base knocks them out of the base.  The user might find it better to dump all of the parts in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will summarize in the fashion of a Bicycle magazine review: Buy it if: You maintain a beard and moustache.  Forget it if: You&#x27;re looking for clippers to cut your hair.base.  The user might find it better to dump all of the parts in a drawer.    I will summarize in the fashion of a Bicycle magazine review: Buy it if: You maintain a beard and moustache.  Forget it if: You&#x27;re looking for clippers to cut your hair.</li>
    <li> The blades are nice and the design is great (not to mention the price) but after using it for two months the size attachments continue to break at the perforations leaving the attachments utterly useless. Unless you plan to shave your beard off every single time or just shave your head, I do not recommend this product...</li>
    <li> Have been using it for over 2 years without many issues&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was that the charger stopped working all of a sudden&lt;br /&gt;And there&#x27;s no replacement charger for this, so on has to buy another unit&lt;br /&gt;Instead I bought a similar (Norelco) cheaper version of this with a similar charger from Walmart&lt;br /&gt;For about $15&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the charger worked and it&#x27;s been working fine since&lt;br /&gt;I got the product for $30 ($25 + 5 shipping) and now it&#x27;s like $92 + $5 shipping&lt;br /&gt;which seems an absurd price hike&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s worth buying it for that price&lt;br /&gt;It would be a good buy for around $40</li>
    <li> This is a handy little product. It is indeed light and easy to travel with. The numerous attatchments make  at home personal grooming very versitile and easy.  Being female I do not use this product on myself, but my man is very happy with it.  This can save you a trip to the barber.</li>
    <li> The Bikini Trimmer from Phillips is a waterproof trimmer with six different head attachments for all the feminine trimming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This trimmer is NOT waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Similarly it has multiple trimming heads depending on your trimming needs. . .so good amount of variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Bikini trimmer has an epilator (ouch!), but this has the ear/nose hair trimmer. Sometimes it pulls other times it cuts. Either way it could discomforting for some folks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Bikini trimmer has a travel bag, but this has a cheap plastic stand that is intended to sit on your bathroom countertop. It takes up too much space in my opinion and a nice travel case to throw the heads &amp; trimmer in and store in drawer would be much more practical. Unless of course you are a person who trims daily. . .then the countertop stand may be your thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This trimmer is more powerful than the female one. It trimmed my beard well and quick and didn&#x27;t sound like it was a lawnmower stuck in overly high grass&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The user&#x27;s guide is a recycled paper fold out. This one at least gives you some instructions on which head to use for which trimming need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This trimmer seemed to work well on cleaning up the hairline after my wife cut my hair and that of my three boys&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;We are happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is versatile and meets the grooming needs of most men.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by saying my wife usually grooms me, so she was more excited to receive the Philips Norelco G480 All-in-One Premium Grooming Kit than I was. That being said, we both have found it to be a worthwhile grooming kit that gets the job done. All of the attachments serve their purpose, and they&#x27;re easy enough to change when needed. Also, we&#x27;ve yet to experience any problems with charging the system or keeping its charge.&lt;br /&gt;The base for the kit is made from a not very sturdy plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it will stand the test of time. Also, while I do love the overall function of the system, I still prefer my Gillette Mach 3 for a nice, smooth shave when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this grooming kit is a good value for the retail price, and a recommended tool for your hairy needs.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome, it works great and is easy to use. The diffrent blades snap on easy and snap off just as easily. It is a great buy if this is your first one or have had one in the past. Rechargable battery and multipule attachments, can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> its a very good product at a reasonable price. its 100% worthy to spent on it.</li>
    <li> I love the eyebrow trimmer! I dont think I will need the hair comb but the rest of the set is worth it. It would be nice if it were a vacuum system.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how the G480 works for cutting hair on your head, but for making cleanly demarcated sideburns or shaving a somewhat heavy beard to result in a close, stubble look it isn&#x27;t as good as the cheaper Norelco G370 or a likewise cheaper Remington shaver, using either the G480&#x27;s main shaving attachment or its 1\\&quot; wide precision trimmer, with or without the plastic guides attached to them. The detail, micro foil shaver and nose hair attachments do seem to work better than on the G370 or on the Remington product. (The G370 does not include a micro foil shaver or a detail shaver and its nose hair attachment doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as the G480&#x27;s does.) In other words, whether due to unit to unit variation or a design problem, I haven&#x27;t found one product which alone will do what I want well enough. Given the higher price of the G480 I am disappointed, particularly in light of the overwhelmingly favorable reviews here.</li>
    <li> This is the best I ever owned. (You have play ~$200 and get a better one. But for this price, its a steel)</li>
    <li> i use this often for nose trimming, shaping the neck line and sideburns, as well as keeping my eyebrows trimmed, the hair trimming accessories are not meant to last though, after a while they fell apart, i do use this a lot and glad i bought it, the price is fair also</li>
    <li> Works fantastic!  Plenty of power unlike my older Norelco plug-in shaver.  I use it for beard, mustache, ears, nose, back of neck.  I was very annoyed with the \\&quot;AA\\&quot; battery powered nose trimmers I have had in the past.  The G480 solved that problem.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used all the attachments after charging it full and it works gr8 as per my expectations.</li>
    <li> Norelco has improved the product somewhat over the years in terms of features and styling, but hopefully kept the durability and functionality of this long-running mid-priced beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for any man that needs to trim their hair.  I bought it years ago and use it regularly and its still working strong today.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband quite a few years back and he loves it. It still works great! The little caddy helps him keep everything organized/tidy and the different length options are super helpful.</li>
    <li> This is the best groomer I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve worn a beard for 30 years.  It is sturdy, but not too heavy; extremely simple and easy to swap attachments,  precise settings for length of hair and the settings stay put; and very easy  to clean.</li>
    <li> The attachments are easy to change and clean.  The battery life is also fairly solid and the unit was actually more powerful than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> It has no battery level indicator. I have been times that it run out of power in the middle of my haircut. This drive me crazy. One charge can haircut twice with no problem, but the third shave will be dangerous, depends on how long you use it in the first two cut. Moreover, it has no discharge function, so there is no easy way to uncharge and recharge after the second cut. Or should I just recharge after the second cut and let the battery \\&quot;remember\\&quot; that power level? This probably will lead to single cut per charge I think.</li>
    <li> Purchased product in November of 2009 to trim beard. Plastic combs appeared to be flimsy; however worked as expected.  I went to trim my beard this morning and noticed the trimmer was dragging a little bit.  I continued trimming, which I shouldn&#x27;t have done, because the plastic comb forks had broken off.  The new look is now a beard that resembles zebra stripes, with short and long gouges of beard stubble.  Good product if you have a short term beard....but for long term spend the mony and get more quality.</li>
    <li> My beef with the groomer is that it does not support a wide variety of voltage I bought this as a gift for my bro living in Pakistan and their the voltage supply is at 220-240 range. The adapter has burned as it only supports 110 volts and he has not even used it once. It does come charged but he does not want to risk using it.</li>
    <li> I received this as a birthday gift from my daughter and her boyfriend.  The product works, as most other reviewers here have indicated, pretty good for beard and mustache and so-so for hair grooming.  That said, the instruction manual, rather than being a well-illustrated book, is black and white printing on a HUGE sheet of paper that folds into dozens of little squares.  You can&#x27;t access anything in it easily, and to fold it back you essentially have to maim it back into place.  It is difficult to unfold due to its ungainly size.  The print is small and the illustrations poorly done.  I&#x27;d have given the product a \\&quot;4\\&quot; rating if it had a decent manual printed in well illustrated booklet, but they went the cheap route and made it hard to use.  Next time I buy a beard trimmer, I&#x27;ll try a different company and see if I can find one that spends a few extra cents for a decent owner&#x27;s manual.  Also, be careful not to bump the stand.  The adjustable attachments are securely in place, but the replaceable head across the front sit loosely and will go flying if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> shaves clean.... reasonable in pricing, but the tray is a little flimsy. Better then most out there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now.  It works fairly well and the trimmer still holds a good charge for weeks at a time.  The 3 stars is for the plastic guards.  The blades are fine, but the plastic guards get brittle over time and break seemingly on their own.  I&#x27;m guessing they don&#x27;t hold up to the vibrations of the trimmer. I only use this about once a week, but the guards were breaking withing a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these. The first lasted well over a year and the one I&#x27;m using now is going on two years because I was able to use spare parts left over from the first one. They are simple to use and do the job well. They are so inexpensive it&#x27;s entirely worth it. I started to look around for a new one I&#x27;ll be needing soon but can&#x27;t locate them anywhere. Not on Amazon, CVS, Walmart or the company&#x27;s website. Maybe EBAY but I doubt it. Not a crisis as there are other good grooming kits out there. I was just comfortable with this kit.</li>
    <li> Till this day I still use this item. I love it. Would def purchase Philips products again. Plus you cant beat the price</li>
    <li> I like all the options this trimmer has but the attachments are flimsy and break over time. I still use it daily, hopefully Norelco has spare parts. The battery has lasted through multiple charges. Most other trimmers have had their batteries fail much sooner than this one.</li>
    <li> Got this for my early teen son to \\&quot;kinda\\&quot; start shaving, maintaining his side burns etc.  It was OK, nothing great.  The trimming parts were pretty good, but the mini shaver and the precision trimmer were not the greatest.  Ended up returning this and getting a Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch, which turned out to be really great.      Overall, might have been the wrong shaver to order for what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought the G480 about 6 years ago for one particular use, but use it for others as well. I have a BAHA (bone anchored hearing aid) implant. That means I have a titanium screw in my skull that a hearing device attaches to. My hair would grow and get caught between the device and the anchoring screw, \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; the hair. I use the \\&quot;small trimmer attachment\\&quot;. Actually, my husband does since I can&#x27;t reach. The small width is just right to shave a circle around the screw abutment. Works beautifully for keeping the hair from pulling. In addition, I wear my hair very short (shorter than my husband&#x27;s in fact). We use the \\&quot;large trimmer attachment\\&quot; with the \\&quot;hair clipper comb\\&quot; set to 5, and he \\&quot;shaves\\&quot; my head at that setting. All directions, so it&#x27;s all even, resulting in my hair being about 1/4\\&quot; long. Then we switch places and using the same attachment and comb and setting, I do his hair. For him, we just go one direction, the direction the hair is trained to go. That effectively trims his hair without a \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; look like I have. When the hair cut is done, I take off the comb, and use the trimmer without it to clean up the bottom edge and shave his neck for a \\&quot;finished\\&quot; look. I discovered this review page when I was looking for a replacement small trimmer attachment (years of the blade hitting up against the screw abutment has taken its toll), and a replacement hair clipper comb as pieces of it have broken off with all these years of use. But those two pieces and shipping will be about half the price of a whole new set, so I&#x27;ll just get a new one and freecycle the old one (I&#x27;m sure someone will want it to use the attachments we&#x27;ve never used). Bottom line, regular use by two people for 6 years equals excellent value for the small amount of money it costs.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent trimmer for under $30.  They last about 2 years under moderate to heavy use, but still a good value.  We typically keep the base charged and use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> From eyebrows to nose hair to facial hair to man-scaping, this set is all you need for the things a regular razor can&#x27;t effectively work on. Mine has been going strong for over 3 years and I&#x27;ll buy one again when it starts die.</li>
    <li> Given the simple baggie that is provided to carry this item, the clipper combs are easily broken during transport. This has happened  multiple times when I travel abroad and bring this along with me. It becomes rather frustrating: while it is, indeed, cheaper than a haircut every month, you can get a better deal by paying $35 or so on amazon for the wahl chrome hair cut kit. I use that nowadays and have no problems when I travel with it. Not only are those parts more sturdy, but the hard case in which it comes prevents damage while traveling. That&#x27;s the best deal I&#x27;ve found so far in the world of self grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> Para los fines que lo compr&amp;eacute; no dio resultados, o sea, no sirve ya que lo que quer&amp;iacute;a era una afeitadora que reemplazara la Gillette Macht 3 Turbo que tengo, de manera que pudiera afeitarme mas r&amp;aacute;pidamente y c&amp;oacute;modo, pero esta no sirve para afeitadora ya que solo te afeita la capa mas alta y te deja muchos errores, ademas de tanto que hay que pasar para poder dejar unos resultados mas o menos aceptables te deja irritada la cara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Por lo dem&amp;aacute;s, como se que no solo es afeitadora prob&amp;eacute; la maquina de afeitar y el delineador de pelos de la nariz y o&amp;iacute;dos y el resultado fue muy bueno, en poco tiempo se puede hacer un buen corte y un excelente cerquillo, ademas de recortarte los pelos de la nariz y oreja de manera r&amp;aacute;pida y sin la molesta tijera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pero como dije antes, la hab&amp;iacute;a comprado para utilizar la afeitadora con la cual quede decepcionado.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband, who recently started growing a beard.  He couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Does everything he needs it to do.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great for facial hair trimming.  With any substantial amount of hair, however, the clippers definitely reach their threshold.  I buzzed my hair with them and found myself having to go over the same spots over, and over, and over again to get my hair even.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Braun that never did work properly/ The switch was of such poor quality you had to squeeze the device, hold it in the right position then attempt to trim. Needless to say, I&#x27;ll never buy another product from them. I researched the Philips Norelco G480 at Amazon, read most of the reviews and decided to make the purchase. It arrived quicker than I expected in just a matter of days. What a pleasant surprise to find out that it actually worked better than I expected. When I purchased it, I didn&#x27;t really think I needed all the extra features and heads, but now I use almost all of them and am very pleased with the results. If it it continues to work as it does, I&#x27;ll be completely impressed and purchase other products from them as necessary.</li>
    <li> After using my cousin&#x27;s Norelco 380 for several years I finally decided that asking him for it all the time was getting annoying. So I decided to get this model. Being that it is the 480 I assumed that it would be better, was I wrong. First thing that I noticed was that the material felt cheaper than the 380. Then when I used it the machine would pull out my hair. In all the years I&#x27;ve been using the 380 I never had that problem, even when the battery was dying. I tried it several more times and it would do the same thing. Eventually i had enough and returned it.</li>
    <li> Having owned Norelco grooming products for years, I had high hopes for this but alas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different blade heads are nice as well as the combs and the way it looks and attaches. The close cut blade works great. That&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil shaver is useless and doesn&#x27;t shave. The new version is a bit taller over all for the larger blade. The finger slot is a waste (more design than functionality since it&#x27;s not meant for ambidextrous use. The angle of the blades seem similar to the older versions (g300 series) but the surface area on the angle portion (on the top or back side directly after the blade) is so small that it really doesn&#x27;t work for close shaving. I also use this to shave my head and found that the angle and surface area don&#x27;t allow for a close shave. The curve they have added causes a gap between the blade and my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard attachment comb seems like the height adjustment has changed and does not allow the beard to be trimmed as nicely. They blades also get extremely hot, especially the precision trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m deeply disappointed with this product as it seems this is a major design flaw with their new models. Not sure which flat headed person they tested with but it&#x27;s not going to work. I contacted Norelco who stated they would set up a money back guarantee but that requires me to pay for insured, tracked shipping to them to get my money back so I&#x27;m out almost $8 if not more just to ship it back. Glad I purchase from Amazon where they will refund me so I can purchase an older model.</li>
    <li> Love, love,  this item it works so well on my husbands beard and mustach. I am a hair stylist and I borrow it sometimes.</li>
    <li> These are definitely great clippers, no doubt about it. I have a long history with these products (the worst occurrence being the time a pair of clippers started burning and smoking when I was in the middle of shaving my head), so I approach these things with utmost caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is of how hard it is to get into the packaging. These products always seem to be over-packaged, with thick plastic layers to cut through just to get to the product. Just use a good pair of scissors to cut through the wrapping and be careful removing the pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once out of the packaging, there&#x27;s really nothing to say but good stuff: The clipper comes with a neat little holder (pictured in the product listing) that keeps all the little pieces in place. The clippers themselves are small and sleek, easy to handle - and wireless, which is nice, because the cord was always getting in the way with other clippers I&#x27;ve used. There are a number of add-ons for doing ears, nose, eyebrows, sideburns, whatever, so you&#x27;ve really got everything you need in one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco&#x27;s tended to be a good company for this sort of product, so I&#x27;m confidant it&#x27;ll last a while, too. Overall, an excellent grooming kit.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of personal grooming kits around, but few come with the experience or quality of Phillips Norelco. Many are underpowered are easily damaged. That is not the case with this kits. the blades are sharp and appear to stay sharp and it d more than adequately powered precluding pinching and grabbing whiskers and hair.    What ii lacks is decent and readable documentation. It is still not clear to me how one of the attachments, the eyebrow trimmer comb fits on the appliance. I even went to the web site and downloaded the \\&quot;owners manual\\&quot; so I could get a better look. It has not helped. For the life of me I cannot fit the attachment on. So I have pretty much resolved to go through life looking like  Leonid Brezhnev.    Note to Phillips Norelco: I created a pretty funny video review detailing my efforts to install the comb in question. The product is much too good to suffer such ridicule, so I refrained. Fix the documentation and send it to me.    PS After another hour of trying I finally figured out I was using the wrong trimmer head, and once using the right one I easily installed it. Now I may be a klutz, but I do have two college degrees so I am not completely stupid. The documentation for this product is not up to par.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;Norelco G480&#x27; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but don&#x27;t expect much more out of it.  I myself personally keep my facial hair neatly trimmed, yet stubbly at the same time, so something like this is a nice catch for someone like me.  I like the fact that this Norelco comes with the little display/standy doohickey thingy for all the different attachments.  It&#x27;s nice to know where everything is &amp; it displays everything nicely.  The attachments all seem to work pretty well for the most part too.  Here are a few of the cons that I&#x27;ve run across since using the G480.  First off, if you&#x27;re the kind of person who truely likes to have a clean shave (no stubble) you may wanna look elsewhere.  Just for S&#x27;s &amp; G&#x27;s I decided to see how close the G480 would get &amp; unfortunately it didn&#x27;t quite get right down to the skin.  It left stubble &amp; in some areas just completely missed hairs altogether.  Another problem with this product is that it tends to pull a bit.  It&#x27;s not gonna kill ya by any means, but there&#x27;s definately some pain involved (especially the nose trimmer, OUCH!).  The other thing is right out of the box you need to charge the thing.  Normally this wouldn&#x27;t bother me, but in this case you can&#x27;t just plug it in &amp; start to wack away hair, no, you need to wait until the thing has a full charge before you can really get started.  I learned this the hard way while trying to cut my actual hair one morning before work.  I&#x27;d gotten a halfway around my head when the G480 ran outta juice.  Luckily I had another hair trimmer to finish the job otherwise... well you get the picture, things coulda been bad.  IN all I suppose I&#x27;d recommend this for traveling more than anything else (&amp; don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d suggest cutting hair without a back-up).  The G480 works for me okay, but it&#x27;s definately not without it&#x27;s flaws.  Those looking for a daily razor clean shave may wanna look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have a goatee and have used several different grooming kits over the past 10 or so years.  This is by far my favorite.  Just a quick list of features I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. there are 5 different tools, and they are easy to switch back and forth -- a full sized trimmer, an ear and nose groomer, a shaver, and two smaller sized trimmers for precision detailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. there are 3 different comb attachments -- and they are all transparent, which makes it easy to see where the blade is cutting, plus each has 8 different numbered settings so it is easy to control the distance between the comb guard and the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. the carrying case is very solid and has spots for each of the attachments, so it is easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. the blades cut nicely -- I&#x27;ve tried each one and each seems to do just what it is supposed to.  I probably won&#x27;t give up my other shaver for the shaver attachment on this one, but it does work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. it is simple to adjust, so I can cut my goatee and moustache and sideburns to just the right length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. the attachments can be washed in running water -- no need for oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. does everything I need and more -- I never thought I&#x27;d use a nose hair trimmer, but it sure beats plucking the hairs out with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few minor complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it would be nicer if the recharge plug fit directly into the storage unit -- as it stands you have to take the groomer out in order to plug it in and then it won&#x27;t stand in the storage unit until it is unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I can&#x27;t send email or navigate road maps or listen to mp3s with the all-in-one premium grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. otherwise, for the quality of design at this price it would be hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned with how functional the G480 kit would be after recently purchasing the Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer and being very unimpressed with its power and function.  Oddly enough, given that the T765 was more expensive and had far fewer extras, the G480 kit was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very versatile and allows you, via attachments, to trim all sorts of hair, from ears, to nose to beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough after being fully charged and didn&#x27;t pull my hair like the T765 did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Short battery life.  I also suspect, given my experience with other similar Norelco products, that the lifespan of this item is very short because the battery will die completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes up a lot of shelf space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver attachment not for regular use.  If you need an electric shaver then buy a real full sized one.  This attachment is only meant for extremely light use.  (And I don&#x27;t think anyone should expect the shaver function, at this price point, to be that fully functional in the first place.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;This is neat little product that you&#x27;ll be able to use to trim around the edges every so often.  It should not be seen as a full time use product to use daily or for giving full haircuts.  Recommended with reservations.  If you require something more hardy plan on paying a bit more.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband as he uses a similar product.  Under the guise of me needing a good and thorough review, I conned him into growing a goatee and mustache.  I happen to adore facial hair on my man, but for his job he prefers a clean shave most of the time.    Over the course of about 5-6 weeks, I had him using this product and its various tools, daily, while I grilled him about his thoughts and the experiences with it.    Overall he was completely impressed.  He has a coarse beard and electric razors of any kind never seem to give him a close shave.  He was pleasantly surprised at the close shave he was able to get while trimming and shaping his goatee.  The only thing he didn&#x27;t utilize was the ear hair trimmer as he doesn&#x27;t need that...yet! ;)    He didn&#x27;t have anything at all bad to say about the product&#x27;s performance and was impressed by all the attachments.    His only complaint was in the case in which everything sits.  Every time he went to move it, the products/attachments would fall out of the case, making a mess.  Although he&#x27;s back to being clean shaven, he is still utilizing some of the attachments on a daily basis.  He claims it&#x27;s a great product and from what I could see and feel, I agree!    4.5 stars    Cherise Everhard, August 2008</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to help keep a newly grown goatee trimmed and groomed, and also liked the fact it had the other attachments for use around my face and neck.      The product does what it is supposed to do, and does it well.  I have not encountered the \\&quot;tears in my eyes from using the nose hair trimmer\\&quot; scenario (but then again the inside of my nose doesn&#x27;t look like undergrowth in the Amazon Rain Forest), and the trimmer guides are awesome.  As stated clean up is as simple as turning on your faucet, and the storage base keeps the unit and accessories clean and in one place.    Now that reason for losing one star-  As others have stated \\&quot;NiCad batteries\\&quot;??!!  I didn&#x27;t know they still made those, but perhaps it keeps a very good trimmer at this price point, and I guess if this type of rechargeable battery technology was good enough for my great-grandfather, it&#x27;s good enough for me...</li>
    <li> As for the person who does not spend a lot of time at a mirror, this grooming kit is quite satisfactory. The warranted 30 min of battery charge is more than enough for multiple use.</li>
    <li> I use it mainly for facial hair and mostly sideburns. I wished it was a tad edgier for them.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job-not much of any kind of shaver though.&lt;br /&gt;The other attachments dont really apply since I am a baldee. The nose hair attachmentis  not so great for the nose or ears.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now used this as a beard trimmer for a year.  The shaving attachments aren&#x27;t very useful, but the trimmers have worked well.  Unfortunately the guide pieces have systematically broken over time - and today the middle two tines cracked off on the last guide as I was mounting it on the shaver.  So, the motor &amp; battery work great, but I&#x27;m left without a shaver since without guides I&#x27;ll hack my face apart.</li>
    <li> Have been regularly using for trimming the beard , it works. it doesn&#x27;t give close or like that but it only trims to some extend probably leaves a millimeter.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s been using this set for grooming moustaches for years. It&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this set for nearly a year. I use it on a weekly basis for manscaping. It holds a charge very well (I charge it about once a month or less). The blades have held up well for trimming. The accessories are perfect for maintaining my goatee and mustache. Another great product, thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great price and will last for years...</li>
    <li> I have had this excellent trimmer for 3 years, and it has performed admirably. The attachment seem flimsy, but they have held up and served me well. The cutting blades have stayed sharp and I have been very pleased, overall, with the product. So why only 4 stars? Almost 3 years to the day of purchase, the rechargeable batteries will not hold a charge for the length of a single beard trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, I needed to charge the shaver only after every 5-6 uses. After about 2 years, it became every 2-3 uses. About 2 months ago, it became necessary to charge it after every use and it slows to a near-stop by the end of a 3-minute trim. I don&#x27;t find a 3-year lifespan acceptable for a rechargeable product (my Braun electric shaver is into year nine &amp; still going strong).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I just chose to order a Wahl lithium-ion all-in-one trimmer to replace this one. If a three-year lifespan is OK with you, then buy this. It truly does work great. I, for one, will opt for greater longevity.</li>
    <li> Guys, if you are tired of using heavier clippers and getting cut then buy this product. This kit has everything. its light and it doesn&#x27;t cut you and the best thing it has different adapters, nose, sideburns eyesbrows, etc. this is a great buy !!</li>
    <li> Great grooming system. I really like that it comes with so many attachments and a tray to keep them all organized. The unit is a good size and easy to use. I highly recommend this product. Perfect for cutting mens hair and trimming facial hair and side burns.  Excellent quality.  Highly recommend for any metro man who requires a lot of grooming.</li>
    <li> I got this thing mainly for trimming my sideburns.  It works great for that, I will definitely say - better than any other razor system I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  The attachments are very durable, and the razor itself is very efficient.  I haven&#x27;t tried the nose trimmer/ear trimmer - I guess I am too much of a coward!</li>
    <li> They dulled after a year of use but overall did what I needed. Perfect grooming tool and the battery lasts which is super nice.</li>
    <li> I can barely shave the entirety of my boyfriend&#x27;s head after charging these clippers for a full 3 hours. Perhaps we just got a faulty battery.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars except:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic covers are flimsy. I broke a few and bought new ones to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;Not as safe as what it claims. I cut myself numerous times. Be careful in sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> was perfect. until i brought it to Europe. i plugged it into a EU-compliant plug to the electrical socket, but unfortunately, this Philips Norelco unit did NOT detect it had to do with 220V, so its power supply burned without any failsafes or warnings, and I simply had to throw this all set out.&lt;br /&gt;and the funny thing was, of all like 10 devices i had from the US and needed to plug into 220V outlet (by using a special adapter, but not a transformer or anything that converts voltage), this was THE ONLY ONE that just got broke. out of the box. by design. you can&#x27;t use it with 220V. we, the manufacturer, are too cheap to build into it any mechanism to prevent it from burning down when a higher voltage is applied, so when you&#x27;re in Europe, you have to buy a new Philips hair trimming set!!! i never buy again from companies that use that kind of product design philosophy. because it&#x27;s not a design philosophy, it&#x27;s being wasteful and trying to f*ck the customer into buying similar product again. TFB, Norelco Philips.</li>
    <li> This is relevant for G370/G480:  I purchased the trimmer as I liked the convenience of a cord free appliance.  I travel a lot, so it&#x27;s great to be able to pack and take with me.  It&#x27;s very convenient, works really well - I use for trimming hair only.      Major downside is the flimsy adjustable hair trimmer.  The adjustments are not very secure when fitted to the trimmer, however, the flimsy plastic teeth on the comb easily break.  I&#x27;ve contacted Philips/Norelco and it&#x27;s not possible to buy replacement hair trimmer attachments, they can&#x27;t even ship you one for free.  As the item is sold with a Two Year Warranty in the US  they will replace the full product for you.   Seems like such a waste of money in return shipping, packagaing etc.    Come on Philips, just come out with a sturdier hair trimmer attachment that you provide an appropriate hard case for that can easily be used whilst travelling.</li>
    <li> My husband has very thick and curly hair. We were apprehensive if this would work for him. But after charging as suggested and using it for the cutting his hair, we were amazed at how conveniently we could do so. Have not used the beard trimmer yet. But we bought this product mainly for the hair clipper and the nose-hair/eye-brow trimmers. Overall, we are glad to have bought it.</li>
    <li> great trimmer great price</li>
    <li> This product is poorly made and looks like a toy. I purchased this for my husband, so that he can trim nose and ear hair..guess what, it cant even handle that job!</li>
    <li> very versatile - and necessary if you need to shave your body by yourself ..... or by someone&lt;br /&gt;durable and nice cost benefit</li>
    <li> Merchandise arrived as promised and packaging condition was great.</li>
    <li> I am using this since 2011 and absolutely love it. After 2 years of usage, I had to finally order new blades. However, don&#x27;t do the same mistake i did. When blades of this trimmer wear out, make sure you buy it only from philips. Other replacement parts never live up to the quality provided by philips.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time, to this day. Still could have been built a bit better.</li>
    <li> very pleased it was delivered before estimated date!</li>
    <li> Very good product and price shipping was on time and free is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> My husband is still using his, years later, his beard is thick and full, he uses this weekly, does a good job.</li>
