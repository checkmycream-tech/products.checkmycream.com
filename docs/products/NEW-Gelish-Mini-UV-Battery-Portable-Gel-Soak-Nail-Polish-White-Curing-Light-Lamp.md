      <li>My iPhone timer worked great for this.</li>
      <li>GREAT THOUGH.</li>
      <li>The seller was great arrived faster than scheduled.</li>
      <li>The bulb would start to flicker lower then would go bright.</li>
      <li>This is a good idea but the polish never set.</li>
      <li>I loved the system but found that it took the Gelish polishes longer to cure then the recomended time.</li>
      <li>This UV light is a great product!</li>
      <li>I am able to take this with me anywhere!</li>
      <li>Bought this light and it worked great for me.</li>
      <li>I might buy another light that is quicker when I&#x27;m doing all my nails, but for travel and in the meantime, this one is great.</li>
      <li>, my sister had been saying she wanted the gel nail kit and light, so I found this one here at a great price</li>
      <li>I have been doing my own manicures for over a year now.  </li>
      <li>Taking longer and longer each time to kick in full bright then eventually it doesn&#x27;t do it at all.</li>
      <li>I have better than salon quality nails.</li>
      <li>Paying $9.00 for this mini uv light is amazing...</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know much more about it - I&#x27;m a dude after all....</li>
      <li>You will need to do your nails a bit more often with the gelish as it does not hold up as well as the IBD.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>Amazing light.  </li>
      <li>Borage joy n live.</li>
      <li>Clean cuticles and nail bed are a MUST!</li>
      <li>I decided to test on 1 nail in case this light did not work.</li>
      <li>I bought this light because we travel alot.</li>
      <li>I would recoment a LED light instead of this UV light</li>
      <li>It fits well in a suit case and is light weight.</li>
      <li>The lowest wattage that I have found available.</li>
      <li>I also started doing my own nails at home and find it very sufficient.  </li>
      <li>It makes my nail longer to stay under the light</li>
      <li>I read a lot of reviews saying that because of the size + &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; nature of this light, you need to cure for a bit longer than recommended to get results</li>
      <li>you decide to buy this mini uv light</li>
      <li>i can easily fit it anywhere.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a mini UV light.</li>
      <li>, I figured it was worth it for the significant savings!</li>
      <li>You must wipe it clean with a lint free wipe and 99% alcohol solution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>its small and great to take if your going on vacation!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only thing I can see this mini UV light good for would be portability for taking along on travel and using infrequently.</li>
      <li>Does work, you have to leave your nails under the light for more than the indicated time and repeat twice as much.</li>
      <li>My application was a bit sloppy but with practice and time, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll perfect it.</li>
      <li>It will also cure IBD super shine sealer (3 Min cure time).</li>
      <li>its worth everything.</li>
      <li>I actually bought this to give for a Christmas gift, it arrived on time and packaged nicely</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not as powerful as a $50-$200 nail uv/led lamp.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its worth the price</li>
      <li>you can always find it right here on amazon.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m wearing the color &amp;#34;Midnight Caller- Gelish.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>i went right away and tested it out using batteries.</li>
      <li>This light is very compact and works very well,  </li>
      <li>had no trouble at all with this light.</li>
      <li>first coat took one minute, the second coat two minutes and the top coat took two minutes.</li>
      <li>; It is pretty dark.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only been a day since application, but I cooked last night and so far so good!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t count on it for performing long, unless you&#x27;re ok with buying replacement bulbs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Eventually I will invest in a uv/led light but for now this little guy works just fine.</li>
      <li>This light ONLY cures Gelish, but does it very well.  </li>
      <li>So I cured after each coat roughly a minute longer than the suggested time just to be on the safe side.</li>
      <li>While it works in a pinch, if no electric is available, I vastly prefer the AC model.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased a LED light...</li>
      <li>purchased this light elsewhere for about the same price.</li>
      <li>When i have to store somewhere it does not take up much space.</li>
      <li>But for the price I didn&#x27;t expect much else.</li>
      <li>I were one day trying to dry my nails with this uv light and never saw the result.</li>
      <li>what a difference, it takes a lot less time, my manicure lasts a lot longer and looks better.</li>
      <li>The last step is the top coat which I also cured for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: after the last coat cures it will be sticky!</li>
      <li>So I finally purchased the full hand one from U-Spicy; much brighter, faster, so far,</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find it was both larger and heavier that the AC light I normally use.</li>
      <li>I really like using IBD, however as I said I use this light for travel due to</li>
      <li>I prepped the nail as I do for a normal manicure.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you follow the directions: clear the shine, wipe off dust with lint free wipes dampened with alcohol or Gelish nail cleanser, apply pH bond, and keep coats thin.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s only about 12 or $13 about the same price that you would pay for the uv light itself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought the same light at Sally Beauty Supply and it ended up doing the same thing.</li>
      <li>I got a good deal on opi brand base, top and colors</li>
      <li>never worked, never got hot enough to cure gel polish</li>
      <li>i was a little skeptic about getting this mini uv light because it does not come with an ac adapter nor batteries.</li>
      <li>but the times are clearly marked on the packaging.</li>
      <li>and she is 89 years young.</li>
      <li>I got the Gelish system a few months ago and purchased the Gelish Mini Uv light By Harmony.</li>
      <li>my husband found my old iHome charger and connected and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Im not sure what happened but even with the batteries charged the uv light did not want to turn on.</li>
      <li>you should definitely go ahead and buy it or at least consider it. &#x3D;]</li>

    <li> I were one day trying to dry my nails with this uv light and never saw the result. Then I decide to use this machine like a lamp and doesn&#x27;t function too. I try to sell this item in a second store and no one like there&#x27;s , Salvation Army doesn&#x27;t wanted too.Did amazon accept more trash?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mini UV light. I expected that it would take longer to cure my nails. So I cured after each coat roughly a minute longer than the suggested time just to be on the safe side. It&#x27;s only been a day since application, but I cooked last night and so far so good! Just make sure you follow the directions: clear the shine, wipe off dust with lint free wipes dampened with alcohol or Gelish nail cleanser, apply pH bond, and keep coats thin. My application was a bit sloppy but with practice and time, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll perfect it. It DOES take a while to apply but it&#x27;s portable, doesn&#x27;t require electricity, and does the job. Get&#x27;s an A in my book.</li>
    <li> This light is very compact and works very well,  I take it with me when I travel so I can fix a broken nail without having to find a salon.  I also started doing my own nails at home and find it very sufficient.  I might buy another light that is quicker when I&#x27;m doing all my nails, but for travel and in the meantime, this one is great.</li>
    <li> Works well wish i could get all five fingers in but other then that....</li>
    <li> Wife said that it took forever to get nails dried. Definitely not as quick as it should.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this to give for a Christmas gift, it arrived on time and packaged nicely, my sister had been saying she wanted the gel nail kit and light, so I found this one here at a great price and she loves it, she opened it the day of Christmas and did her nails the same night.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews saying that because of the size + &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; nature of this light, you need to cure for a bit longer than recommended to get results, I figured it was worth it for the significant savings! So I did....Double....and it STILL wasn&#x27;t enough. I end up with a goopy mess that is unfixable and can&#x27;t get back the 3 hours of time I wasted. I&#x27;ve tried twice with the same results. I wish I would&#x27;ve just saved up for the more expensive one. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The seller was great arrived faster than scheduled. Unfortunately the Bulb conked out after half dozen full set of nails uses. The bulb would start to flicker lower then would go bright. Taking longer and longer each time to kick in full bright then eventually it doesn&#x27;t do it at all. It was not a battery issue. I bought the same light at Sally Beauty Supply and it ended up doing the same thing. So I finally purchased the full hand one from U-Spicy; much brighter, faster, so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can see this mini UV light good for would be portability for taking along on travel and using infrequently. Don&#x27;t count on it for performing long, unless you&#x27;re ok with buying replacement bulbs.</li>
    <li> Did not work to cure gel manicure at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This UV light is a great product! I am able to take this with me anywhere! its small and great to take if your going on vacation!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this and uses it all the time. I don&#x27;t know much more about it - I&#x27;m a dude after all....</li>
    <li> never worked, never got hot enough to cure gel polish</li>
    <li> It makes my nail longer to stay under the light then the lights are already going out it look likes it going to stop work</li>
    <li> I did not like the product</li>
    <li> It curries the nails, I just need practice. It even showed me the water marks in my country&#x27;s currency.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll I have the mini led lamp from gelish and I love it but this one not so much just used it for the first time this past week and it did not cure the hard gels I was working with. I am not sure if it is bc this is only for gel polish.... But we cured the gel for about 15 minutes and it was still wet in areas. And I am not sure if I can return it now since I bought it just after Christmas so disappointed.</li>
    <li> RECIEVED THIS IT DOES NOT HAVE THE PLUG IN ADAPTER, NEEDS 4 AA BATTERIES AND THEN DOES NOT CURE THE NAILS. IT IS A PIECE OF S*** IF I COULD GIVE IT NO STARS I WOULD. IT DOES NOT WORK AND IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY! NO DON&#x27;T BUY IT ... WHY WOULD YOU WAS YOUR MONEY ON  PIECE OF S*** FROM CHINA THAT DOES NOT WORK???</li>
    <li> I bought this to cure my gelish nails. I use it only with batteries because I lost the adapter.&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#x27;s not as powerful as a $50-$200 nail uv/led lamp. It does mention in the directions that darker nail colors take an extra minute or two. Right now I&#x27;m wearing the color &amp;#34;Midnight Caller- Gelish.&amp;#34; It is pretty dark.&lt;br /&gt;The first coat took one minute, the second coat two minutes and the top coat took two minutes. (I don&#x27;t bother wearing a base coat) I do one hand out of time INCLUDING my thumb by carefully wrapping my hand around the base.&lt;br /&gt;It took me 20 minutes to do my nails. I have better than salon quality nails. Usually when I get them done in a salon they are in such a rush, I end up with gloppy hard nails. I even switched to a more expensive nail salon 25 minutes away and still walked away disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I am saving my self between $720 and $960 a year doing my nails myself. Paying $9.00 for this mini uv light is amazing...</li>
    <li> I bought this to take on a month long trip to maintain my manicure. I was surprised to find it was both larger and heavier that the AC light I normally use. It takes longer to cure the polish, as well. While it works in a pinch, if no electric is available, I vastly prefer the AC model.</li>
    <li> Amazing light.  So way less expensive than a salon manicure. Beautiful. Even have my mother in law asking for manicures with it and she is 89 years young. Borage joy n live. Namaate</li>
    <li> I keep this at work along with a bottle of top coat in case I chip a nail. It does not have a timer so you have to watch the clock. It didn&#x27;t come with a cord but it has a hole for one if you don&#x27;t want to use batteries. I do use batteries but I have to change them often because it give off a very weak light and you have to stay under it around 3-5 minutes. However, I just use it at work for touch-ups so it does the job well.</li>
    <li> Does work, you have to leave your nails under the light for more than the indicated time and repeat twice as much.</li>
    <li> this doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> i was a little skeptic about getting this mini uv light because it does not come with an ac adapter nor batteries. (you have to buy and put the batteries yourself) i got it anyway because it was the cheapest i could find. Well lt me tell you as soon as i got it in the mail i went right away and tested it out using batteries. Im not sure what happened but even with the batteries charged the uv light did not want to turn on. i think it was just my batteries. my husband found my old iHome charger and connected and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What i love most about this product is that it is travel size, so i can easily fit it anywhere. When i have to store somewhere it does not take up much space. Despite its size it works just as well as those big ones they have at the nail salon &amp; you save tons of money on it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you decide to buy this mini uv light and you want the charger for it you can always find it right here on amazon. I looked for it when i bought it just in case and it&#x27;s only about 12 or $13 about the same price that you would pay for the uv light itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its worth the price its worth everything. i love it. i do my nails with it, i do my friends nails as well. you should definitely go ahead and buy it or at least consider it. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Works but you just have to sit there for 15-20 minutes.  Takes 5x longer than going to a salon. But for the price I didn&#x27;t expect much else.</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own manicures for over a year now.  I have to lamps, LED and UVA.  I decided to purchase this one to have for trips.  On my vacation I took it out without even trying it at home.  It was a disaster.  It does not work like the lamps.  It takes forever to dry, if it dries at all.  Just don&#x27;t have the time or patience for this tiny lamp.  I will look for something a little bigger for my trips, this didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. It takes forever to dry your nails. Its just not powerful enough. Not worth doing my nails myself with it taking this long. I would have rather paid someone to do my nails quicker.</li>
    <li> Bought this light and it worked great for me. I did not use batteries just the ac adaptor. I kept my coats thin and cured for one minute longer per coat than the recommended time.</li>
    <li> This thing is a joke it&#x27;s the equivalent to holding ur hands up to an almost dead light bulb dot waste your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that although I am a cosmetologist by profession, I have absolutely no professional gel nail training.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this light elsewhere for about the same price. I used it with batteries. I got a good deal on opi brand base, top and colors so I purchased them instead of gelish brand. I decided to test on 1 nail in case this light did not work. I prepped the nail as I do for a normal manicure. Clean cuticles and nail bed are a MUST! I roughed up the nail bed some with a 220/280 file then rinsed the nails under just water and dried.  Next I applied a dab of gelish ph bond.&lt;br /&gt;I applied one coat of base and cured for 2 minutes. My iPhone timer worked great for this. Be sure to paint just the nail bed- not the cuticle or skin or it will not adhere correctly. I then applied 3 coats of color curing each for 3 minutes. The last step is the top coat which I also cured for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: after the last coat cures it will be sticky! You must wipe it clean with a lint free wipe and 99% alcohol solution.&lt;br /&gt;I had no trouble at all with this light. It takes a while but the times are clearly marked on the packaging. (I did add one minute to the base timing)&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I will invest in a uv/led light but for now this little guy works just fine.</li>
    <li> This is a good idea but the polish never set. The color remained tacky enough to pick up texture from anything that applied pressure.</li>
    <li> I bought this light because we travel alot. Even though it doesn&#x27;t state, it&#x27;s ONLY about 5W. The lowest wattage that I have found available. This light ONLY cures Gelish, but does it very well.  It will also cure IBD super shine sealer (3 Min cure time). I really like using IBD, however as I said I use this light for travel due to it&#x27;s compact size. It fits well in a suit case and is light weight. You will need to do your nails a bit more often with the gelish as it does not hold up as well as the IBD.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GERAT ON THE GO TOOL JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOME BATTRY IF YOU DONT HAVE ELETRICITY LOL GREAT THOUGH.</li>
    <li> I got the Gelish system a few months ago and purchased the Gelish Mini Uv light By Harmony. I loved the system but found that it took the Gelish polishes longer to cure then the recomended time. I recently purchased a LED light...what a difference, it takes a lot less time, my manicure lasts a lot longer and looks better. I would recoment a LED light instead of this UV light</li>
