<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> lash lines are to stiff and not enough full lashes included</li>
    <li> Love them!! Great shipping!!</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re not like the eyelashes you buy from Ardelle or any other brand at Walmart, they&#x27;re plastic and are horrible to put on and don&#x27;t look that good once you finally get them on.</li>
    <li> The base has a thick plastic piece. This makes the lashes inflexible.</li>
    <li> Mine did not come with a stainless steel applicator like it said. T</li>
    <li> Received my shipment quickly, this was not an issue.  However, the lashes themselves I will not be purchasing again.  First off, the base of the lashes is extremely thick and does not conform to the shape of the eye well at all.  I&#x27;ve had to cut them down significantly in order for the ends not to stick out, even when I use double the adhesive and hold them on until dry.  They straighten right out again.  Because if this, of each pack of 10 pair, I have found MAYBE a little less then half of them are usable.  The rest are entirely too stiff to even bother trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the lashes are not gradient short on inside, to long on outside.  They run short, long then short again.  I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but my lashes do not get short again towards the outside edge of my eye.  It does not look natural at all.  Short on both sides, long in the middle?  No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the extra thick lashes, the base of the lash towards the eye looks flat, like paper, not individual lashes.  So it looks like you&#x27;re wearing you&#x27;re little girls play lashes and very fake.  Or maybe your kids cut some lashes out of a pieve of paper for you, and glued it on your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s actually what&#x27;s happened to these, they were given to my daughters to use for dress up.  I won&#x27;t be using them.</li>
    <li> Well, you pay for what you get. I liked the idea of being able to have different styles for different moods. But these are extremely stiff and plastic and uncomfortable. Poke the inside of your eyes. I can usually find the good in everything- but, these I can&#x27;t say I liked anything about them. I bought Red Cherry brand as well as these. MUCH higher quality- obviously more expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Go to Sallys and buy hair extension glue. Ask the lady about it. Its almost like rubber cement. It sticks immediately and is so easy to pull off at the end of the night. You can even sleep with them on and in the morning nobody will notice they are fake lashes. Its that good and reliable.  Its not the lashes. Its the type of glue you chose to use. Compliments of a Diva!!!</li>
    <li> So fun, wish glue was included</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. this item is cheap but the eyelashes are hard to get off the plastic they come in, the glue that&#x27;s already on them is hard to take off. it leaves a big gunk of glue that&#x27;s noticible when you wear them if you don&#x27;t fully get it off</li>
    <li> What a great price for how many lashes you receive. Are these the best quality eyelashes available? No. BUT, they work. I use them often for photo shoots. Remember to curl (wrap them around a pencil) the lashes before you apply them to a clients lid as these lashes are very straight. I LOVE the doll-like look of some of the lashes. So popular in my salon!</li>
    <li> Did not come with eyelash glue</li>
    <li> love this product, so many great lashes to choose from! very happy</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Love these lashes &amp; love the price! Also super fast shipping! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> They were ok and I gave them to a make up artist friend of mine.  The lashes don&#x27;t feel very natural and are somewhat thick and hard.  Not for me but someone else may love them.</li>
    <li> Good assortment but they are synthetic and not completely even.</li>
    <li> Came in on time and the quality of lashes was great! I think I may have received a duplicate set and not the complete variety as promised. However they were such great products at a great price...Im a happy camper!</li>
    <li> These are totally worth it for the price. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> My niece loves them. She&#x27;s a make up artist and says the variety was perfect.</li>
    <li> This is beyond a good deal. The bands are a little stiff , I&#x27;ve taken to cutting off the ends and bending them around a brush .</li>
    <li> Great buy, I thought they were a little stiff at first but I guess I got use to it. The ones I use to buy which are 100% human hair, in my opinion do not match up.  These last longer (reusable) and so many different looks, im ordering my 2nd box. Now!</li>
    <li> Love the styles but the adhesive was hard to get out of the original plastic packaging , and some of the lashes look really plastic , good deal but, I mean you get what you pay for  .</li>
    <li> These are poorly made not very natural.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes feel very fake compared to others.. but I can&#x27;t complain. Price was great and I still have a bunch left</li>
    <li> They were far too fake looking for me. Spend a few more dollars and buy some that have a chance at looking half way natural.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 17 year old daughter along with a mask to do makeup cause she wants to get into cosmology. This is just fun stuff for her to play around with but I think it will do awesome for her birthday party as well for her friends to play dress up!</li>
    <li> This is such a deal! I bought it even though I thought it might be too good to be true but I have had it for almost a year now and still have so many pairs left! I wear lashes everyday and though I usually buy real ones, I don&#x27;t mind these because they&#x27;re lighter and look just as great. I get lots of compliments on them. So many great styles. The only thing I would suggest is just make sure you trim them to your eyelid length. Easy to re-use and if you do have to throw a pair away, you don&#x27;t feel like you wasted money because they&#x27;re so cheap! Love them! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never buying expensive lashes from the store theses are awesome!</li>
    <li> AWFUL. You get what you pay for I suppose.  These are plastic like and way too fake looking. Guess I can use em for Halloween?</li>
    <li> Such a great price and a good bundle</li>
    <li> My daughter was extremely pleased with these! Amazing price, good quality, look natural and dramatic! She loves long lashes and these were great! Great price &amp; would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> They are not all usable by me.  some of the cards have fun lashes that I would only wear when going to a costume party.  2-3 of them are usable for everyday wear</li>
    <li> Bought these more than once! Amazing for the price!!!</li>
    <li> Worst thing I&#x27;ve EVER bought and I&#x27;ve had my fair share of horrible products.&lt;br /&gt;1 - The lash band is nearly existent which makes it hard to even try to secure the lash onto your eye.&lt;br /&gt;2 - On some of the eyelashes, the glue that is used to adhere the eyelashes to the packaging is on the actual lashes. So when I try to adjust my lashes around to secure them, that extra adhering gets stuck onto my tweezers or on my real lashes causing the lash to move resulting in me getting glue all over my make-up, ruining everything.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Lashes feel so fake. Not soft or flexible. Just brittle &amp; stiff. Again, making it hard to wear the lashes comfortably or even manage to get them on at all.&lt;br /&gt;I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to get top branch lashes like Velour or Lena Lashes but from reading the reviews I was expecting a better quality than what I got. Beautiful type of lashes &amp; great assortment, but the company really needs to rethink about selling these. Definitely a disappointment &amp; waste or money.</li>
    <li> Came fast, very nice and easy to put on</li>
    <li> I loved the price for the lashes. I know you get what you pay for but these lashes were a little too hard to apply at first, but after you get the hang of it they really weren&#x27;t too bad. Only reason that I give it 4 stars is because you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I think the eye lashes are great! They came in a closed package, very neatly organized. The quality seems to be really good.</li>
    <li> love these eyelashes! I have worked with many different brands, and I still can not believe that I found these at such a low price. The quality and variety is great! Will definitely be buying more and more and more!</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 boxes of these so far. There are a ton of styles and I&#x27;m always getting compliments.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the packaging and secure nature in which these lashes came in.  I purchased these for make up clients and I think they will be of great use.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my new Daughter in law gave them to her for Christmas She Loved Them she was very happy to see the different sizes and lengths.</li>
    <li> Obviously these aren&#x27;t the &amp;#34;natural human hair&amp;#34; lashes, BUT CLOSE ENOUGH! So much variety for a natural day to a dinner party or even to the club! Ladies!! These lashes will not look good if you do not have experience applying falsies properly, I reccomend looking up a YouTube video, which is how I learned. I like that I do not have to use a curler with these lashes because they are sturdy and curl up on their own. I reccomend using a dark eyelash glue so it covers up the lash band and especially if you wear a dramatic cat eye like me. Definitely buying again when I run out but with so many at a good price that won&#x27;t be soon obvi.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of lashes!! So many but most of them are the same natural looking ones so if that&#x27;s what your going for order them, but they&#x27;re pretty stiff, I rubbed them between my fingers twirled them around a pencil and really broke them in before use, also cut the edges off because they hang off but they&#x27;re definitely a one day use lash, but there&#x27;s 70 of them so that&#x27;s not that bad at all for the price</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them and she said she will re-order.</li>
    <li> They look plastic when they are on/ very fake looking.</li>
    <li> These were HORRIBLE. I use false lashes everyday for work and these are so so stiff and the adhesive band is super thick and on some there is even adhesive on the lashes themselves. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> very stick, not good quality.</li>
    <li> Great for professional use. Good quality with styles for any occasion.</li>
    <li> The best deal on fake eyelashes! These aren&#x27;t for amateurs though. It takes some practice and you may need to bend or cut some of the eyelashes so that they fit your specific eye shape. However, if you hate spending ridiculous amounts of money at the store - BUY THEM. Where else can you get 70 reusable pairs for this cheap?</li>
    <li> there were only a couple kinds that i actually used, some of them were really thick and flimsy and hard to apply</li>
    <li> They are very artificial and not all styles would work for wearing in daily life. If you aren&#x27;t a pro eyelash applicator, these wont make your life any easier. Some are better for stage makeup or photo shoots.</li>
    <li> Great price, great variety, cleanly packaged and will last me forever!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girl, so her eyelashes could  be on every level of &amp;#34;fleek&amp;#34; imaginable!</li>
    <li> so I am amazed at how much I saved doing this !&lt;br /&gt;I am a avid falsie user and I usually get my pairs for 2-4$ and I saved almost 200$ this year buying this !&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and I love the styles , ranging from natural to more dramatic. Also if you find some of the lashes too thin you can also double them for a thicker look, which is what usually do.&lt;br /&gt;Came in black box as pictured. Would of been a super plus if it came with adhesive glue but either way NO COMPLAINTS here !</li>
    <li> low quality and hard to apply</li>
    <li> Plastic and very fake. I want a refund. I will be sending these back. I&#x27;m a makeup and i wouldnt even feel comfortable putting these on clients.</li>
    <li> These lashes were OK for the price. I guess it depends on what you&#x27;re looking for. They&#x27;re all very big (on me anyway, I guess it depends on your eye size/shape,  I have almond shaped eyes) so I&#x27;ve had to trim every pair. Two of the varieties in this pack are really really dramatic and suitable only for a very dramatic costume-y look. When I received the box it had a big rip in it and some of the lashes were a little messed up. I do freelance makeup artistry so all in all, this was a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re about what you&#x27;d expect for something cheap.</li>
    <li> I like that they have diff options, also great price! I&#x27;m not into the thick bands though and it seems to have a thick clear strip on the bands that are visible so it doesn&#x27;t look as natural as I want them to be close up. Looks nice in pictures and if you&#x27;re professional at applying false lashes like I am. Maybe good for beginner usage and someone not as picky as I am? Will include pictures when I can.</li>
    <li> Love em thank you so much</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are so easy to use and so affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may never buy lashes from the drugstore again.</li>
    <li> Love love love this box.. it allowed me to learn how to use eyelahes in all different types.. the costume eyelashes are good to learn how to wear lashes. . Ordering another box! !</li>
    <li> These Are Awesome,I Plan On Buying More.</li>
    <li> Same quality as lashes in beauty supply stores. Product is definitely worth it if your a MUA or someone who wears lashes everyday.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s going to take a lot of practice to get them to look great but the price and value is absolutely awesome. Perfect for practicing.</li>
    <li> They look too fake for me.</li>
    <li> I am a young makeup artist i started out at the age of 14 I am super passionate about what I do! I have very few clients but I love using great products on them and I wouldn&#x27;t put anything on them that I don&#x27;t like. The lashes aren&#x27;t real hair but they are perfect to use once. I love the different styles they come in and I love that this comes in a bundle and it&#x27;s all organized.&lt;br /&gt;Please check out my makeup instagram and follow me @makeupbychuchii&lt;br /&gt;Help make my dreams a reality I&#x27;m even willing to shout out other artist</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, i am little disapointed, don&#x27;t looks very natural to me</li>
    <li> The base of the lash is very thick and inflexible. It does not move with the lid so there is gaps where the eye curves. It is possible to cut them to use them as individual lashes but that takes a lot of time. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> Looks a bit flimsy so I just use it for my outer corners and looks great!</li>
    <li> smallest lashes are hard to apply. Otherwise, great for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the look they give on, but I am very disappointed with the quality of the lashes.  When taking them off they fall completely apart.  I cannot reuse them as I do my other lashes and I would have liked to use them more then once.</li>
    <li> The eye lashes are not workable at all. I was not able to attached to the eye lade. The material that they are made of is not good. I would like a refund. Please!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRICE AND OFFERED ALL TYPES.  AWESOME</li>
    <li> I love wearing eyelashes for going out/parties/weddings etc&lt;br /&gt;Only one set is actually wearable/natural looking for normal wear (similar to Ardell 110 lashes) the others are more dramatic/costume use&lt;br /&gt;That being said they are very stiff/you need to bend them a bunch before applying&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that unlike ardell/elf/mac etc lashes&lt;br /&gt;I can physically feel their presence the entire night on my eyelids and they&#x27;re a bit irritating&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably because they&#x27;re made from a sharper plastic type material and not soft like other fake eyelashes I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;I will still wear them but I will not re-buy</li>
    <li> Great quality  lashes for the price I bought these for my makeup kit I am a pro mua and I will be using these on my clients. There gorgeous and don&#x27;t feel rough at all</li>
    <li> Great lashes, more than I expected, but now have lashes for every occasion.</li>
    <li> Ive been buying these since 2011 i got a pack with only 10 for my wedding and ive been the 70 pack every since. some lashes i dont use, i give away but for a new look try cutting a pair in half and add a little glitter (make up glitter) and eye liner for a fun club look. the price is unbeatable</li>
    <li> Love most of the styles. But they have a bit too much glue on the lash line. Easy to remove or just use black glue to apply. Great deal for all these. Will buy again. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Perfect and work great</li>
    <li> these lashes are realy easy to use. they are not very stiff like other lashes. the weft is kind ot thick so you have to be careful to lay them close to the lashline every time, and they hold on to eyeshadows so it&#x27;s hard to reuse them with different shades. I like to reuse my lashes, at least 3x&#x27;s a week..so the color absorbancy of these lashes annoy me. I really do like them otherwise. They need to recommend a cleaner that is not oil based to clean them with because they hold EVERYTHING you put on them.</li>
    <li> Comes in a bix which is nice.</li>
    <li> Very stiff, hard to conform to you eyelid.</li>
    <li> If anyone was going to have an issue using these, it would have been me. I&#x27;m a makeup novice, I never read directions, I can barely put contacts in without freaking out, and my hands shake like I&#x27;ve got a pretty good case of the DTs. Lo and behold, in spite of all of that, these fake eyelashes are now one of my favorite things in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety is awesome - there are so many types to choose from, and each looks substantially different when applied.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use - I trimmed them to size, put on some Duo clear lash adhesive, and popped them on no problem.&lt;br /&gt;They look fantastic - honestly, why haven&#x27;t I been using false lashes for years?&lt;br /&gt;They stay on forever (though I am sure Duo is to thank for that)&lt;br /&gt;The price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a recent convert to the world of false lashes, I can&#x27;t recommend these enough.</li>
    <li> The band is too stiff,very difficult trying to get the lash to bend to the shape of the eyelid.</li>
    <li> They look natural when you have your eyes open but there to shinny and it a thick line they look fake n plastic. But u get what u pay I love making Fancy look and just dramatic look this lashes go good</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these lashes omg I am so happy I purchased these definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> lashes are hard, I cant wear them at all.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Eh its a great price-IF you could choose the selection. I was aware of this when I bought it so I took the risk. However after receiving them I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again. If you want to explore with different styles some for work, some for going out, some for play-this is for you. However if you want them for everyday work wear just to enhance natural lashes there are only a few styles in this box to wear.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m being anal... but the product description says 70 Pairs False Eye lashes... but when i actually got the box it said 70 pieces. From school days i&#x27;ve learned that a pair is actually 2... which means that going by the product description this should really be 140 pieces on the BOX and not 70 pieces.</li>
    <li> Now I can wear fake eyelashes every time I do my make-up! Way more affordable. Great quality, style, lengths, products.</li>
    <li> They look like drag queen lashes for the most part and are too long for normal eyes so they need cut and shortened. Some are so ridiculous you could only wear them on Halloween</li>
    <li> I have to be honest by saying I couldn&#x27;t rate this product a 5 only because I&#x27;m a newbie with using fake eyelashes.  I found the thinnest ones went on easier and looked most natural.  The other ones had a thicker band and for me, they looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, If I had more experience, I would certainly rate this better.  Shipping and delivery were great.</li>
    <li> I love the variety. I love that i can reuse them a few times and that there different styles for day and night</li>
    <li> wow... I guess I get what I deserve for buying lashes in bulk. I have rather large eyes and these lashes are HUGE. They cant be trimmed either because guess what? They fall apart. Did I mention that the lashes are incredibly sticky but are not self adhesive and the sticky goo on the lash was to keep the lash on the plastic display. AND it doesnt come off. OH and the ones that I was able to get to stick on were so shiny it looked like I was wearing pieces of a Glad Garbage bag. What a waste</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheap for the amount of lashes I get... but the shape of the lashes are nothing too spectacular, I actually don&#x27;t like 4 out of the 7 shapes...&lt;br /&gt;and there&#x27;s a lot of glue on the lashes that stickes them to the paper, really hard to take off</li>
    <li> I love the thick eyelashes the most.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the money!</li>
    <li> Great quality very natural looking! Fast delivery as well</li>
    <li> I love this kit.  Out of all the eyelashes there was only 1 set I didn&#x27;t like the way they looked.  Other than that I LOVE all these different style lashes!</li>
    <li> some of the styles are too bold and the strip is extra thick</li>
    <li> There there is a wide selection of lash types, from a little enhancement to full blown glamour. Really good selection. The lashes are good for a a 1 time use, and are really stiff. Be sure to flex and bend them many times before applying glue. The</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Overall a great deal for all the lashes and they have different styles. Lashes are difficult to put on though especially if you have no experience du to being thick banded but other than that really like them</li>
    <li> this is a great value product, would recommend for nightclub wear not day/office wear. I work in a nightclub so it works perfect</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know how to put on lashes... don&#x27;t buy these. It&#x27;s that simple. I do, and for how many you&#x27;re getting, this is a STEAL. Lashes at the store go from $1-$10 and this is 70 for around $10! Good range of styles. They aren&#x27;t made or real human hair or anything, but they are the same quality of lashes as the single packs you get from target or something. If you&#x27;re on the fence, buy it and leave it in your makeup box. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Just a fair warning, these eyelashes are NOT made for beginners. They are stiff and the band is way thicker then most eyelashes. I wear eyelashes everyday, but these  I have difficulty applying. They have no flexibility to them at all that I have difficulty getting them to make a natural curve when applying them. For me, when I have gotten them to stick, usually the ends stick out straight. I have tried cutting them long and having them short. I&#x27;m glad they have worked for other people, but I can say they just aren&#x27;t for me. They are for sure  a great deal. I can&#x27;t argue about that. To get so many at such a low price since most pairs cost me about $6.99 each. I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again but just because they don&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t work for someone else.</li>
    <li> I am using these lashes for glam photo sessions so the people who are wearing them only have them on for about an hour to two hours. In this application they work great. I use a good adhesive and they work perfect for this. The plastic stips are quite heavy and do lift if not using a good glue. I haven&#x27;t tried them for extended wear as that&#x27;s not what I needed them for.</li>
    <li> too plastic-y and shiny, and just looks fake.</li>
    <li> Good deal on lashes....alot of them seem too dramatic for my taste but i havent applied all of them on so not sure if that will make a difference.  There are at least two sheets of lashes in there that I will def use though so this is still a great deal!</li>
    <li> My Daughter was so excited and this was a great deal. Only thing to make better would be to add a bottle of glue!</li>
    <li> The band is too thick so they don&#x27;t bend well.</li>
    <li> There ok . Kinda hard not very flexible around the base. but ok for the price</li>
    <li> I have tried 8/10 of the different lashes. All of them are pretty great, maybe 2 that are just WAY too costumey. The natural ones look good, and some of the more thick ones look pretty professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the band on these lashes is kind of thick, so if you wanted to just wear the lashes and eye-shadow (no liner) it will look a bit off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a big lash fanatic, I would still but these just to try out and keep around. For the price of about 3 pairs of Ardell lashes, you can get all of these. I am sold!&lt;br /&gt;-Kayla xx</li>
    <li> Horrible quality .. I&#x27;m a pro at putting on lashes but the bands don&#x27;t bend to fit your eye at all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deal for the price but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;And I would never wear the thicker ones not even for a Carnaval. They are huge!&lt;br /&gt;The glue that holds them in the plastic sheet does not come off from the lashes making them difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I get lucky and they look wonderful but most of the times I would just give up trying.</li>
    <li> These lashes were hard to manage during the installation process. I only liked the first two styles (which were problematic) and didn&#x27;t see a realistic occassion to where the other styles.</li>
    <li> These are not specialty high dollar lashes BUT they are like to the ones I typically purchase for $5-$7 at various stores. I found them easy to use and apply. There are several styles and some that I am not sure I can pull off but I am going to give them an honest try. Even if I just like one set, it would be well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Just as the pic!&lt;br /&gt;Love them and wears them all the time now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good advise: Buy the &amp;#34;Duo Lash Adhesive&amp;#34; as glue.</li>
    <li> I had never been a confident falsies wearer as I would always get either conscious or was too scared to apply them to my eyes. This set changed my take on the whole issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with these false lashes and now have been wearing them 2-3 times a week. They are so easy to wear and remove. You will have to buy lash application glue. This is a pack of 70 lashes. For dirt cheap price. And the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes have some thing for every one. I started out with the thinnest most lashes to get comfortable with the whole idea and now have been daring some heavy ones as well. I have gradually learnt and become more confident in wearing them and am so happy to have tried it. Its worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE GREAT.  I LOVE THE PRICE, THE QUALITY, AND THE AMOUNT I REC.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BE ORDERING SOME MORE WHEN I RUN OUT.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE HEAVY LASHES THE BEST.&lt;br /&gt;THEY LOOK GREAT FOR EVENING WEAR.&lt;br /&gt;DONT JUDGE THE HEAVY ONES TILL YOU TRY THEM OUT.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BUY</li>
    <li> I normally use Ardell&#x27;s demi wispies or the Walmart brand. I know the price makes this look great but they look horrible. They just scream plastic and cheap. They are extremely stiff and have ghetto lengths. You WILL look like an underpaid exotic dancer wearing these.</li>
    <li> These are great!  There are 10 sets of 7 different styles!  They range from a couple that look very natural to very dramatic! I highly recommend these if you love wearing different lashes.</li>
    <li> Good lashes for my clients comes in different  sizes and shapes depending on what my client wants</li>
    <li> These are a little thicker at the base than i like just because i feel like they wont stay more than 1 or 2 days. but they are easy to reuses and honestly for the price i can just buy more. Great variation in styles for any occasion work to weddings...</li>
    <li> Great variety.  Can double up on some of the pairs.</li>
    <li> great lashes..love the different designs easy to apply and lasts long</li>
    <li> They were very small in lenght. I had to use two per eye.</li>
    <li> For the low price, honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much... But I was blown away. The quality is pretty great, they all look nice and are easily worked with, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m displeased in the least. Of course, you do have to buy your own adhesive, but that can be picked up at any drugstore (or, hey, you&#x27;re already here. Try Amazon!). As for trimming them... it wasn&#x27;t an issue for me as I have big eyes, but for some prom looks I did for friends, a few had to be trimmed just a smidge. But that&#x27;s due to eye type and not really the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, very happy with the product and will be buying again in the future... if I ever run out of these 70 pairs in the first place!</li>
    <li> There is great variety and an amazing value! You have simple and natural looking to extra dramatic lashes. Great to put in your kit if you&#x27;re a makeup artist. They are a little stiff and you do have to trim the very edges, but if you just roll them and play with them they are very easy to work with. I will for sure be buying more of these!</li>
    <li> They make your eyes sparkle at least people told me, easy and fast to put on and hold it shape when remove.</li>
    <li> The price for these are unbelievable. Love them...i only wish that there were more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking ones. They get thicker and thicker as you look through the swatches. Either way its a great buy!</li>
    <li> absolutely love the lashes! they came shipped securely and all of the lashes looked great! They were super easy to put on with glue</li>
    <li> I like in jersey . Not a thing to dislike about this product . Very affordable . Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future ! 😍💳</li>
    <li> As I said, the first 4 sets are pretty natural. The other 3 not so much. But for the money this was a killer deal. I will probably save my last 3 sets for when I do makeup for the musical. Those will be perfect for onstage! Great value.</li>
    <li> Loved them! I didnt actually use them for my eyes, I make eye themed jewelry and these were perfect for what I was going for. For crafts they are great!! For actually use, I have no clue.</li>
    <li> Not worth it they don&#x27;t stay on no matter what glue</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have gotten my hopes up for these. They look too fake. The thin ones are fine but the thick styles are horrible. Just double up the thin ones</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;ll just start off by saying that I&#x27;ve used false eyelashes for years on a daily basis. Revlon has never failed me, although their lashes are seriously overpriced. I&#x27;ve been looking for some good quality yet cheap falsies for quite some time now, and I found them in this purchase. If you frequently wear false lashes, these are for you. Each pair can be worn for a few days if they&#x27;re cleaned and applied properly, &amp;#60;also, you need the right glue- I either use revlon or duo&amp;#62;. Bottom line is, you won&#x27;t regret buying these as long as you&#x27;re experienced in wearing false lashes.</li>
    <li> There are seven styles and all of them were perfectly sized for my eyes. I didn&#x27;t have to do more than glue and shadow to go. The pair I first wore were long but light weight and my sister-in-law couldn&#x27;t tell they weren&#x27;t real, but kept commenting on how pretty my eye makeup was before I told her and she realized that it was the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice set, for such a low cost. Easy application if you&#x27;ve used falsies before. NOT hard to learn to put them on,especially with so many tutorials online. Shipping was fast. I got them a day early. Simple black box with plastic \\&quot;trays\\&quot; inside holding ten pairs each. No glue, so don&#x27;t forget to buy some. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> The lashes look really good I have only tried out one pair so far but I love them I definitely will use all of them , subscribe to my YouTube channel ( Bria Legree )for updates on these lashes and also to see my unboxing video :) thanks</li>
    <li> I bought these lashes because of the product  review from others.  I haven&#x27;t actually worn them yet, but I must say it literally took me 15 minutes ti figure out how to get the lashes off if the plastic.  They were so secure I did not realize the weren&#x27;t covered in plastic.  They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
    <li> These are a little stiffer than more expensive eyelashes, so they don&#x27;t curve to your eye as well. It just means they are slightly harder to put on. But once they&#x27;re on, they look awesome!</li>
    <li> so far so good they look hard thin and kind of hard to peel off at first without ripping but besides that they look great on</li>
    <li> I love to wear lashes every day but some days I don&#x27;t have to wear thick l ashes. This set I found lashes allows me to change up and this box is a decent amount of money in a beauty supply store  would cost me 1x more this this cost.  I will be doing more business with this seller.  Love the quality of these laser also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27; s a great bundle price - but these are definitely not like the ones you would get at the store. They are plastic looking and the glue to use to keep them on the plastic is a little thick and does not come off well.  If you don&#x27;t care about that, just add your lash glue and stick em on, otherwise, you&#x27;ll be spending a few more minutes (or longer) trying to take that glue off.  But with enough black eye liner, it&#x27;s fine.  It works for me as I use them for practicing new looks or for a quick jet around town grocery shopping type thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who owns a salon.. she&#x27;s happy with the quality and now using on her new customers</li>
    <li> These are great!. I love having so many styles from which to choose. Would&#x27;ve given it 5* if it including as much variety with lower lashes.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying these because they are so cheap, but they work perfectly. I don&#x27;t notice the difference between these and the ardell and elf brands and you really can&#x27;t beat the price. I did not have to cut mine at all. Apply with a dark eyelash glue and let it sit 30-45 seconds before applying. Start in the center and work your way out. I&#x27;ve been able to reuse these multiple times as long as I put them away once I take them off to avoid damage.</li>
    <li> The best bundle of eyelashes on the internet EVER. so many beautiful varieties and different looks. Dramatic, and natural. Fantastic quality on par with Ardel. Love this such a good deal last forever!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible investment! They look so fake.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I&#x27;m in the process of learning about fake eyelashes, and honestly, I don&#x27;t have a whole bunch of money to throw on eyelashes. I saw the ratings, and they were very good. I tried on a pair and honestly, I&#x27;m disappointed. They are a pain to keep on- I kept having to readjust them every 20 min, and they still almost fell off at the end of the day. The band is way too thick and rigid, and I even wiggled them back and forth for a while to loosen them up. I&#x27;m sure part of the reason why they didn&#x27;t stay is because of my adhesive (Revlon- I shall be switching to Duo), but still. I&#x27;ve worn falsies before and gotten others to work just fine with cheaper glue, so I&#x27;m sure the big issue is the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Okay, it was the adhesive. I bought the duo adhesive, and once I started using those instead of revlon, the lashes stayed on all day (even when I FELL ASLEEP in them). Now, I love them.</li>
    <li> Lashes are beautiful and simple, it is a great buy when starting out your make up kit.</li>
    <li> As a person who wears falsies every single day I was very disappointed but also not surprised by the quality of the product. If you&#x27;re looking for cheap lashes that tear when peeling them off their strip, then these are the ones for you. They look very fake and not to mention they are a PAIN to put on and KEEP on. Needless to say I have 70 pairs of lashes taking up room on my vanity now.</li>
    <li> We are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;The lashes came in a black box (like the one in the picture) that was slightly thin, but in the end i tore it open like it was Christmas. There are seven styles of lashes and I think 3 or 4 of the styles are the same but increase in thickness. The lashes are really good quality and I&#x27;ve been using one pair for a week and a half now. Just don&#x27;t tug on them so hard when you remove the glue from them! :] I cosplay, so this set of eyelashes is perfect for me; there are 70 pairs! :D</li>
    <li> If you fake lashes frequently then this pack is a wonderful investment.  They look amazing, are easy to put on, and most importantly they aren&#x27;t $3-$5 a pair like drugstore lashes (of the dame quality). I actually like these better than some of the higher end lashes I&#x27;ve worn. The only thing I must say which I&#x27;ve read in many other reviews on these is that they are a little stiff and don&#x27;t shape to tour eye really well. If you wiggle them around and gently bend them you can feel the stiffness bend away and they become %100 more fitted to the eye.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these lashes! You get a lot for your money so worth it</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist, I go through false lashes very quickly. Needless to say the price of these lashes appealed to me. I took a chance based on the reviews and was pleasantly suprised when the box arrived. They are great quality and more than worth the price.</li>
    <li> They are nice lashes; I just wish the packaging would&#x27;ve been thought out a little better, the packaging could expose the rest of the lashes unused to damage.</li>
    <li> These lashes are fantastic. Box come with pairs you can&#x27;t normally get by themselves.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! PErfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Know all diva&#x27;s love 70 pairs of eye lash&#x27;s a box at best price vrs $5. a pair all my orders are always on time.</li>
    <li> These were shipped exactly on time and the only issue I have with the shipping is that the boxes containing the lashes were stuffed into an envelope and arrived a little smushed (hence the subtraction of one star). The lashes themselves were in their proper places except for a few that had gotten loose and despite them probably being shipped that way, were not flattened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lashes~ I tried the natural looking lashes the other day, and they were perfect! I had to cut away the excess on the ends (which keep them in place in the box) and to hide the part that attaches to my eyelid, I just brushed some eyeshadow over it like it was a liner, and ta-dah! They were very easy to clean, and I figure I can get at least two or three more uses out the the pair I used. My husband loves &#x27;em, but isn&#x27;t sure about the thick set I have. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to try them but I&#x27;m waiting for a special occasion. I also wish that they came with adhesive glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say it was SUCH A GOOD IDEA to buy these together instead of separate. I totally saved money on this purchase and I&#x27;ll probably buy from these guys again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> i recommend this to anyone who uses fake lashes on a daily! it brings many different styles so youre able to switch it up and they are made of really good material and are wide enough to fit big eyes! love love love i will order my second box soon!</li>
    <li> I just received my lashes about an hour ago and I already have a set on! I do Youtube tutorials and was in the market for some new lashes but I didn&#x27;t want to buy the individual sets for $6-15 each! I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes for almost 4 years (not every day though) and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with these. The band is sturdy and has a medium thickness. They come in 7 different styles as described and they also arrived on time!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> THE EYELASHES ARE LIGHT AND THE APPLICATION AREA IS THIN SO THEY WORK FOR ALL EYE SHAPES WITHOUT IRRITATION. NICE SELECTION OF EYELASH STYLES</li>
    <li> Way better than I expected. Lots to choose from and looks wonderful on.&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with glue but that okay since I rarely use glue that actually comes with the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again when need be.</li>
    <li> They have a very cheap plasticky feel and don&#x27;t stick as smoothly as other cheap lashes, but these are cheaper, so quality is cheaper too. They are ok though for parties and other functions.</li>
    <li> SO cheap looking! No way anyone will mistake these as natural. Very fake and not worth it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Buyer beware. These are not flexible at all and are SO DIFFICULT to put on. Even with the best glue and even special tools just for placing eyelashes, these won&#x27;t stay on for long!</li>
    <li> Not bad at all for the price!  But they are synthetic so the thick ones look a little fake</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for natural looks then go with these if you want a dramatic look you can still get this just have to double or triple the lashes. But I recommend. Love them</li>
    <li> Items are as described, great eyelashes.  They last for days before i have to change for a new pair they are not like the ones in walmart that ball up very easy, these are very affordable and last a very long time, you can /will get multiple wears out of one pair of eyelashes.  They are very easy to clean without ripping and tearing the lashes off when preparing to wear them over and over.  **THIS ITEM WAS DISCOUNTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW**</li>
    <li> Great quality, better than the last lashes I bought from a different seller. I am a makeup artist so buying lashes in bulk is necessary for me, and there are definitely on par with what I needed from this product. They arrived just on time too!</li>
    <li> I received the lashes pretty quick!&amp; packaging was great none of the lashes came messed up or anything! They are really pretty all of them they do feel kinda heavy because of the glue on the lashes and you have to be very careful when removing them from the plastic I ripped about two lashes .. but otherr than that I love them.! They have a good mixture of styles i like the more natural looking ones and the pointy ones that seem like they&#x27;ll be dramatic they actually look really natural and turn out to be my FAVORITE! DEFINITELY will re purchase (when I run out)</li>
    <li> My second time ordering great team</li>
    <li> These are the best lashes! If you are a makeup artist or someone who wears lashes a lot, I highly recommend these! Love the variety of different styles; thicker ones for a dramatic look and finer ones for a more natural look!</li>
    <li> Sorry but these lashes are awful.  They don&#x27;t curve to your lid,  they are hard and plastic like.  I hate them. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought these when some of my eyelashes were falling out due to a Maybeline mascara! Anyway they worked great! They stay on well as long as you have a good glue, I just bought a $4 one from the drug store. I recommend using tweezers to take off the adhesive that keeps them stuck to the plastic before you apply the glue. 3 or 4 of the styles are great for everyday wear and the others fun, but much more drastic and don&#x27;t look as realistic. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Terrible product, I open the box and just left it there . I wish I had never order this. -1 start if you ask me</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my shipment. However the packaging was poor and there were little bugs all over the lashes so I didn&#x27;t want to use them :(</li>
    <li> there are lots of them but it wont stay right. i have not decided if I will buy this again. will try it more and update this post</li>
    <li> it was okay. some were too dramtic for me</li>
    <li> I was expecting more natural lashes.  For the price, these are fine.  They are made with plastic, and if they&#x27;re not, they look plastic.  As such, they don&#x27;t behave like real lashes, so putting mascara on them is a mistake-- the mascara will simply clump and make them look even more fake.  I won&#x27;t be using them for daily use, but probably for Halloween.</li>
    <li> i only like one pack in the whole box.</li>
    <li> they were hard, very plastic to the touch heavy on the lids and hard to apply I did not like them at all. I would not repurchase ever again and would not recommend to anyone ever.</li>
    <li> I Bought these expecting good things from what I read from the reviews I decided to give it a chance. Here is what I will say.  If you are looking for Halloween costume lashes these are it. Bands are thick so it might be hard for you if you aren&#x27;t using the right glue. If you are looking for something natural, not shiny, and actually look real, this isn&#x27;t for you. at the price I paid I should&#x27;ve gotten the ones I bought before. :(</li>
    <li> they are fine. but not great.</li>
    <li> One word: AMAZING! Wide variety from naturals to dramatics. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The light lashes are good but bigger ones looks like the shades on your eyes. I could see them when I put them one. Can, t use them on my clients. So more then half from the box I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> These lashes are inexpensive because they are of poor quality. I purchased this product and was excited to use them. When I opened the package though, for every style of lashes, the lashes are longest in the middle. False lashes should be longest at the outer corners of the eye. They look abnormal when applied and worse - it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get all the factory glue off the lashes which causes even the best lash adhesive to refuse to stick. I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed wirh a purchase. I would never buy these again and do not recommend them. I will be tossing these in the trash.</li>
    <li> I see so many bad reviews but unless you know how to wear and put on eye lashes, don&#x27;t buy this. It&#x27;s not for beginners. They are very thick, long, full lashes that will make your eyes absolutely gorgeous. I recommend this product. Make sure you buy revlon black/clear glue adhesive. You&#x27;ll need that specific glue to keep them on without the ends starting to lift. The stickier the glue, the better. They&#x27;re not hard to take off either. I don&#x27;t know why some girls are saying that. Like, seriously, what glue are you using?? Nail glue? -_- anyway, I also recommend that before putting them on, play with the eyelashes. Bend them by just.. Idk.. Like a back and forth curve by holding the ends? I have no idea how to explain that. If you don&#x27;t know how to make then fit your eye, watch a YouTube video or something...</li>
    <li> I just love my eyelashes it seems like they  are not as good as getting them from a salon but who cares i love a variety of eyelashes right infront of me!</li>
    <li> The packaging was pretty standard as to be expected.  These are the cutest sets of ashes and for a great price at that.  I will order again for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought these for the price, and you really cant beat that. the more expensive eyelashes in store (3.99 or 4.99 each) are easier to put on . Those eyelashes are thinner and easier to bend. The ones here are a bit waxy and plastic. However, I got them on fine and they look just the same. You get a lot of different eyelashes in the box. I will have fake eyelashes for years with this.</li>
    <li> Plus, there are a nice variety of sizes and styles to choose from....for the price, it is an amazing deal. I&#x27;ve ordered these twice and I plan on ordering them again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I ordered these eyelashes about a week ago &amp; received them yesterday. Shipping was fast! I haven&#x27;t tried them on yet, but so far I like the different styles. I was a little hesitant at first because i thought they were going to have a plastic feel &amp; look, but they feel like actual hair. The only con is the packaging. Its very cheap &amp; the eyelashes are just smashed in the box. Over all it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> for those of you who like to play around with eyes&lt;br /&gt;i love that the strap is thick so it looks like i have eyeliner on too!&lt;br /&gt;beyond my expectation &amp;#34;for the price&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;they are light and thin, look really natural and sexy</li>
    <li> It looks really real.&lt;br /&gt;I cut half and used on the corner.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I got a date!! I just love this!!!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the packaging but I like the product very much</li>
    <li> Great deal! The lashes vary in style, so it is fun!</li>
    <li> These lashes are such an amazing value and they go on easy and look great!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. Really are a steal for the price and they last forever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for about a year now, and yes, I wear them every day.&lt;br /&gt; They are hard to get use to if you haven&#x27;t used them before but practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I can wear the same pair for about three days without them falling off or the edges coming up. ( I use revlon lash glue )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are awesome. I&#x27;ve been using for over a year and would recommend them to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this helped</li>
    <li> Show details&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend is pretty obsessed with fake eyelashes; I don&#x27;t know what the gimmick is all about, but I must admit they do make her eyes pop up when she puts them on. She&#x27;s constantly complaining about the ones she buys; either they fall off too easily, don&#x27;t go on in the first place, or they get so messed up while she&#x27;s taking them off she has to throw them away. Her birthday was coming up, so I wanted to buy her a good set of eyelashes as one of her gifts. Came across Eye Splashes, and purchased them immediately (not being 100% sure of how they even work, lol). She was ecstatic when she opened them and saw the different styles included. I don&#x27;t know much about them but I do know that when she puts them on, she looks even more beautiful. According to her, there are no issues when she removes them either (she doesn&#x27;t have to throw these away), so that&#x27;s a plus. Overall, this product has been a hit and scored me some major points as well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is very good for beginners! Once you master these you&#x27;d be able to apply any lashes! It&#x27;s been a year and I still have some left.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m sort of a beginner at first but I got a lot of practice with putting falsies on. I tried Ardell, Natural lashes from Walmart, revlon, Koko and red cherries and these I can say are nothing like those. These are stiffer and feels and look fake compared to the higher brands that are actually known. Since I purchased these and opened them already, I think I would use the thinner and less dramatic ones more since they are less stiff. I would say they are workable but wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth my money if I want my lashes to look really natural and real.</li>
    <li> Although the lashes are decent for the price, there is a line of adhesive/silicone that stays stuck to them (that they use to attach to the sheet they come on). It is noticeable when on the eyes</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how soft these lashes are. The 7 styles allow for a natural/ day time look or a more seductive / night out style. There is one style in the box that&#x27;s not quite my look, but I can use them for practice anyway, so no loss there. Overall, I love this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I kept coming back to this product and I decided to give them a try -  so pleased that I did! I tend to wear lashes everyday (I have long lashes, but I just like the extra pop falsies give). I have tried many brands, both expensive and inexpensive, and here is what I have found with the Eye Splash brand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- So many!&lt;br /&gt;- Great variety ranging from natural, everyday lashes to glamorous, voluminous ones&lt;br /&gt;- The lash band is terrific. It&#x27;s just the right width to hold glue and apply easily. I don&#x27;t know how to describe that in a better way, so I hope that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS (which shouldn&#x27;t stop you from buying):&lt;br /&gt;- Like others stated, the lashes are longer than normal so you will have to cut them to fit your eye shape, but I honestly have to cut every pair I get, no matter the brand&lt;br /&gt;- The adhesive that is used to keep the lashes adhered to the packaging is a bit menacing to take off compared to other brands, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get it off - just have patience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if I ever run out of lashes, I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> So thrilled to get this many decent eyelashes for this price. The cheapest I usually find are $3 a pair. What a bargain</li>
    <li> i know nothing about how much women love make up fake eyelashes etc etc lol but by the expression my mom got getting these from me im sure she loved them ^^ u get a small little black box like in the picture :) and inside are the eyelashes nicely placed and not broken or anything :) and they really do look natural :0 no plastic shining or anything they look very natural and u get 70! natural .eyelashes for a very cheap and affordable price :) so if u wanna go out and party .dance or just look beautiful with some new eyelashes then get these and be guaranteed satisfaction ^^</li>
    <li> I thought there would be more styles varying from natural look to glamorous. In the end all lashes seem to be too dramatic, and not fit for daily use.</li>
    <li> I like how there are multiple styles but I didn&#x27;t like the type of lashes. The lashes were a little fake and stiff to the ones I wear now.</li>
    <li> The lashes are long, so you&#x27;ll have to cut them to fit your lid. The packaging could be WAY better, but they all came intact. I&#x27;d buy again. Beats Walgreens.</li>
    <li> bought this for a friend as a suprise. Way cheaper to buy these than 2$ a pair! one time use only unless you want skanky looking eyelashes! But we take them off after one night anyway! WIll buy again</li>
    <li> Way too hard in texture</li>
    <li> I enjoy wearing lashes almost daily, and buying one set can cost 3.48+ anywhere. I went on amazon. I had previously ordered bulk lash sets like this but shipped from China and they were horrible so I was weary about this purchase. But they are great! You can definitely tell that the lashes are artificial by feel, but regardless they look great. As far as staying on I&#x27;ve had no issues with them coming off, and they certainly don&#x27;t hurt peeling off. It&#x27;s nice to have the several different styles to change up your look. The box they come in is nice and small. And the sheets they come on help you keep the lashes nice. I would definitely buy more of these.</li>
    <li> Great selection, great price! They are a little stiff, but the look good on,</li>
    <li> These are an incredible deal once you get past the learning curve. After some hit and miss practice, I have these perfected. First of all most people will need to trim them, trim off any long strips on the ends and trim off some length if you need to. Flex them back and forth several times, especially the ends, this will make them less stiff. I have the best luck applying them over a coat of liquid liner rather than pencil liner, probably because of oils in the pencils making them not staying adhered. I use either Duo lash adhesive or Darkness adhesive, I find the Darkness easier to use. Most importantly I use a metal false eyelash applicator tool, I bought it off Amazon for just over a dollar, it came from China. Let the adhesive get a little tacky. Grip the lashes with the tool about 2/3 of the way up, point the lashes almost straight up towards your eyebrows so you can place the band close to your lashes and not get glue on your real eyelashes. Set them down in the middle, rotate them down if you need to, then use the ends of the tool to place each end right at your lash line. Once you have it placed, use the tool to gently squeeze the false lashes into your own, as if you are clamping them, careful not to pinch your eyelid. This sets them right at the lash line &amp; helps them stay adhered. Press the ends down again if you need to. Once dry, use mascara to blend your eyelashes into the falsies. I usually just coat the underside of my real lashes and don&#x27;t really paint all the way up to the false lashes. Using this method I am able to apply these easily every day, and if you are very careful when you take off the lashes and peel off the adhesive, you will get about a dozen uses out of each one. This pack will last you FOREVER.</li>
    <li> Was ok, I paid 20$ with shipping so I kinda felt like it was too Much, but there r 70 pair.  I&#x27;m sure I can work with them. Will I buy again.. Maybe not.</li>
    <li> There the best my wife is very happy with them and I will be ordering from u guys more thank you</li>
    <li> This product is great I brought these for my girl and she love them.. I will deffently but her more</li>
    <li> these are great buy. unlike real hair...these wont get clumpy from the eye lash masscara, and they keep their shape and stay full. I like the varity in the pack...i was doubt ful because of the cost..but the reviews that everyone left made me feel comfident to buy. I am glad that did... buy these, you wont regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this has negative reviews maybe if you don&#x27;t know how to apply false eyelashes. I am in love with these. If you are looking for expensive quality these aren&#x27;t it. These are perfect for one time use possibly twice depending how well you take care of them. I always spends round 5 dollars in drug stores on one pair. But I get 70 of an amazing price. I honestly love them and will be purchasing another box when I run out.</li>
    <li> Nothing like your Red Cherry or Ardel. You are looking at Halloween store quality with these lashes. I gave them to my daughter to play dress up.</li>
    <li> These are really horrible quality.  If you are extremely skilled at putting on false eyelashes, you will eventually succeed at putting these on.  I did, but the amount of glue, time, and effort did not make these worth the while - even though they are insanely affordable.  It just takes way too long to get them to stay put, and then they come off halfway through the night.  The band that holds the lashes is way too thick and not pliable. This is too bad because I was really hoping that for the price they would be decent.</li>
    <li> These are rather amazing. I bought the Duo Lash Adhesive with it and absolutely no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;The edges only come up IF you don&#x27;t use enough eyelash glue. It doesn&#x27;t have to be globby and overdone either, just a little extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came in a box with cardboard separaters between each plastic set that the eyelashes were attached to, I like that. If you clean them carefully you can use them many, many times. The strip is very durable, which is what made other people say that the edges don&#x27;t stay glued down but it&#x27;s really a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I love &#x27;em. If I ever run out I&#x27;ll definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> good for the price but definitely only one time use lashes. They are plastic and some of the thicker styles are hard on the eyes</li>
    <li> its so cheap and works real well, pretty good one</li>
    <li> awful awful&lt;br /&gt;shiny plastic&lt;br /&gt;dont stay no matter what</li>
    <li> multiple options, long wearing, durable.  Can be used multiple times if taken care of properly.  I will never buy anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Ever.</li>
    <li> the lashes are stiff initially and have this clear adhesive that hold it on to the plastic display holder. the adhesive comes off after several uses. i guess you get what you pay for. The lashes do irritate my eyes at the end of the day. most lashes that I&#x27;ve bought are flexible and light.... these are not.</li>
    <li> Too thick to stay on your eyes, they fall off easily no matter what glow you use.</li>
    <li> great quality for the price</li>
    <li> The lashes look and feel good but I have a hard time getting the adhesive they use to keep the lashes in place off so I&#x27;ve ruined quite a few. There is also incorrect word usage in the directions so it&#x27;s obviously not an American company. &#x27;Two&#x27; is used when it should be &#x27;too&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Good selection of lashes, nice variety, flexible lashes, really nice shape. Will reorder when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price and quantity! I go through fake lashes like no tomorrow and I was sick of paying $3-4/pair for the cheap ones. I have to say that although these lashes are on the lower quality end, they are definitely better quality than some of the lower end lashes. I have also used the $10/pair lashes which are in a league of their own but a pain in the butt to lose. I use a pair of lashes about 3 times before they don&#x27;t cut it and I have been really impressed with the flexibility of these lashes as well as the ability to clean them for re-use. You get 10 pairs of 7 different kinds of lashes starting from more basic and ending up with very dramatic. I did notice that these lashes were quite a bit longer than the ones you might usually buy, but they were extremely easy to trim to better fit my eyes. I also like that there is an abundance of lashes for an amazing price. I have been wearing fake lashes more and am not so worried when I misplace one. These lashes look great! Watch a tutorial on YouTube if you are not sure how to use fake lashes. These are worth it as long as you know that the quality is in the lower to mid end range and that they might not look as natural as the higher end ones.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite lash kit. so many lashes and they are very quality! i reorder this every time i run out!</li>
    <li> I love how many you get, but it would be nice to have more of the natural looking ones. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever wear the criss-cross ones. Still, you can&#x27;t beat the price for that many lashes.</li>
    <li> absolutely love the lashed! they came shipped securely and all of the lashed looked great! they were super easy to put on with glue</li>
    <li> These are not the best but they are good for any makeover. Not human hair</li>
    <li> I had never tried false eyelashes until I got this product.  I was always very intimidated by trying them, and was petrified they would &#x27;droop&#x27; off in the middle of a presentation or date.  When I was offered the opportunity to purchase these at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I thought this would be the perfect time to give it a try.  I set aside some time to play with a pair and went to &#x27;work&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my relief they are way easier to put on (and take off) than I had feared.  I did find that (for me) it is easiest to do while sitting down in front of a magnifying mirror.  It helped me to be able to put my elbows on the table while putting them on.  I dare say though that with practice this may not be necessary at all.  As a complete novice I can&#x27;t help but recommend these false eyelashes.  Not all of them will be appropriate for daily wear (at least not for me), but I intent to use some for when I dress up for concerts, Halloween and other special events.  The more natural looking ones I plan on using for evening wear or special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really fun eye lashes that I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I needed to get some makeup for a wedding. And ordered this to go with. I had it available for the bridesmaids when they were getting ready and it was great! The lashes are a bit harder to apply, they are a little stuff. But all in all looked great and served their purpose.</li>
    <li> LOVE these lashes. A couple of them are a little short for my taste but I like them long. Very pleased with this great deal and great product.</li>
    <li> I loved these lashes!</li>
    <li> These got returned ASAP! They are cheap, stiff and un wearable!</li>
    <li> 70 pairs of eyelashes!! I bought this a long time ago and haven&#x27;t even gone through maybe half of it. They look really good.</li>
    <li> This is truly a bang for your buck, set, very nice lash assortments and they were all in good shape and usable, great shipping and fast service</li>
    <li> Some of the eyelashes are thick, but overall it is worth buying. I like the more natural looking eyelashes rather than the thick ones. They all look good, just be careful taking them out because I accidentally ripped some.</li>
    <li> Very diversity shapes and 70 pair!! Really cheap!! So good. Quality is Not bad. Quite good:)</li>
    <li> affordable and reusable .</li>
    <li> awesome Eyelash deal... Totally worth your money.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even believe that I only paid $18,95 for them!&lt;br /&gt;Use Duo glue and the little false lashes applicator and you should be good. They look very natural!&lt;br /&gt;I will order another box just incase they become unavailable for any reason.</li>
    <li> thought they might be to plastic, but they work fine, I love em.</li>
    <li> Two words, Love Them!</li>
    <li> Eyelashes looked better than expected and will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LASHES THAT COME WITH IT BUT THEY ARE STIFF AND I FOUND ALOT THAT WERE THE SAME PAIR WERE DIFFERNT LENTHS</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping and a really great price!  Good experience!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great selection and good quality lashes</li>
    <li> i have bought these for me and I loved them! My mother in law saw me with them on and loved the look, I showed her the box ,and she wanted one, so I just bought her a box for Christmas. If you know how to apply lashes, you will love these, If you are a beginner watch some youtube videos! and get this!! You will have plenty of lashes to learn with. Best Of luck!</li>
    <li> These eye lashes are great! They last much more than the others (provided that they are properly glued and applied), up to 10 days! Styles are varied and fashionable so many family members have tried them. I&#x27;ll keep buying more of these at the best price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky mostly when it comes to my fake eyelashes and so i decided to try these out and it was quite fair. It&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s not the worse. I didn&#x27;t know about this until it came but please be aware that the lashes are VERY long.</li>
    <li> This is one of those cases where &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  Not quite sure how to explain this but the lashes &amp;#34;stick out&amp;#34; too much for my liking.  It&#x27;s like they stick out straight ahead, and at the very tips, there is a curl.  Looking from a profile perspective, it looks very unnatural.  The lashes fit the length of my eyes without a problem, but since there is no &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; in the shape of the lashes, the ends tend to pop up.  Maybe if I use a ton of lash glue (hopefully they&#x27;ll stay attached) and use a lash curler after, it &amp;#34;might&amp;#34; work.  I have a few more lashes in the package to play around with.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE LASHES, A LITTLE STIFF BUT IF YOU BEND THEM, THEY&#x27;LL WORK JUST GREAT. AFTER FOUR MONTH I&#x27;M ORDERING A NEW BUNDLE</li>
    <li> I have to admit, the ones that you buy at your local drug store or Wal-mart are better. I thought they were stiff and not as users friendly as the otc ones. I look at it like this, I bought them for my daughter&#x27;s xmas and if she finds herself in a last minute jam, she&#x27;ll use them.</li>
    <li> These are great but do appear a bit plastic-y in comparison to other lashes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> These are terrible! They don&#x27;t bend at all and they come off almost immediately! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this is a very good product for us make up fanatics who love the lashes... you won&#x27;t be disapointed!</li>
    <li> Very artificial looking! Obviously looks plastic and very cheap!</li>
    <li> The lashes come right off of the strip.  I didn&#x27;t like them at all.  I didn&#x27;t use them at all.</li>
    <li> Needed some trimming but lashes are of high quality and look natural. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Bunch of lashes, now I just need to figure out how to glue them on right.</li>
    <li> I buy lashes all the time. These are beautiful but are need to be worked with a lot,as they tend to not staying on the tips.  Good deal but requires more working with. My glue might need to be upgraded. But looking at most the reviews. I&#x27;m seeing the same thoughts on them. If they was made a bit less hard I think that would help. I&#x27;m use to better fitting lashes. Good for the amount of money  you spend on them.</li>
    <li> Buy this pack instead of spending your money on individual pairs at time. The styles are all great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Do not work. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my GF on her birthday. She loves them! She likes the variety of style lashes. Now if I can just make her stop leaving them on the darn bathroom sink!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These certainly won&#x27;t be confused with natural lashes. Lashes set too close together, and the shape isn&#x27;t natural.</li>
    <li> the price was right. the quality was good. many types to choose from for different occasions or for sharing with friends.</li>
    <li> Great price for so many lashes, but they look cheap and fake.</li>
    <li> great deal for the money</li>
    <li> Awesome! Not Oprah quality but still eyelashes and cheap. Cool styles and work.</li>
    <li> Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> not so much quality, but still usable. It is a deal for the amount of lashes you get. If you are not used to fake lashes, you may find them a little harder to put on.</li>
    <li> You sure get your money&#x27;s worth! But... they have a very cheap plasticky feel and don&#x27;t stick as smoothly as others of the same price. They are ok for practice and play time.</li>
    <li> For someone with next to no lashes, this was a steal and amazing find.  Compared to buying them at the store, I save upwards of $30 for the amount of pairs that come with it, was kind of scared about the quality but was thoroughly surprised and pleased with the purchase!</li>
    <li> For the price these are good lashes. They definitely need trimming, there is glue that has to be picked off before applying and the band is so thick I find it hard to cover with liner, gel or liquid. But unless you&#x27;re taking close up pictures of your makeup the thick band isn&#x27;t too noticable. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the amount you get for the price. These lashes are okay but would perfer ardell for sure.</li>
    <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, it is worth it if you run through lashes every week.  It&#x27;s not that bad, despite it being cheap quality.  The bands are irritating if you don&#x27;t put them on fittingly or loosen the bands.</li>
    <li> These are plastic.  Not a good quality plastic.  They don&#x27;t form properly either.  If you do need something quick and cheap to play with.  Then purchase these.  You do get a lot of them with different styles and they could be a cheap practice tool.  If you plan on wearing them or putting them on other people.  I would not suggest it.  They will look cheap and like a costume.  For costume purposes these will be ok.  They will not be ok for beauty purposes.</li>
    <li> it is like plastic and hurt us</li>
    <li> Wow, there are literally 70 pairs and great quality! Very saTisfied, thank you</li>
    <li> Im in love!  These are a great addition to my makeup kit! Definitely better than paying $3 per pair. #Quality I&#x27;d give them a 4</li>
    <li> Waw I&#x27;m amazed at how many for the price. I usually buy one pair for 4 dollar but this is amazing. Seven sets, all different styles. You can&#x27;t go wrong. You&#x27;ll probably get a few wears our of each individual lashes. I recommend this :)</li>
    <li> These lashes are great for beginners! I have been using them and I get nothing but compliments every time.</li>
    <li> An eyelash set with exactly what I was looking for.  Very attractive styles with lots of variety and a very deep black.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Endless supplies of lashes! They look stiff in the container, but when you put them on it blends really well with your real lashes (just like my more expensive lashes). You just have to play with them more before putting it on because the band that holds the lashes is stiffer than other natural false lashes I&#x27;ve used. When you pull them out to use for the first time, be really gentle because it is really sticky to its packaging. Other than that, you will have a lot of fun with the different looks you can pull with these.</li>
    <li> Great present!, She Loved!</li>
    <li> arrived at time, the box is a little soft so can be easily damaged, they did not come exactly like the photo, I had 4 sheets? of the fuller ones and did not get the criss-cross like ones (i was hopping them &#x3D;( ) but still is a goog purchase</li>
    <li> These are great false lashes!!  There are so many different types in this set and you get 20 of each style.  I have a problem with the dyes used in mascara, so these are a great alternative.  I highly recommend these for anyone!</li>
    <li> i loved how I got so many for the amount but the glue they use to hold the lashes bothers my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lash fanatic these come with a lot for a great price however they are stiff, if your not used to wearing lashes do not buy these they will probably bother you untill your used to the feeling of light thin lashes.</li>
    <li> Plastic.Hurt my eyelids when put on. Doesn&#x27;t look natural. Used one pair and thrown the rest away.I would rather pay more money to get real hair lashes.</li>
    <li> I love them. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not worth it they very cheap</li>
    <li> OMG I AM SO IN.LOVE LOL THEY CAME PRETTY FAST AND LOOK BEAUTIFUL,CAN NOT WAIT TO WEAR THEM,FINALLY GOT SOME WISPY LASHES LOVE LOVE LOVE ❤💛💚💜💙</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are great and where super affordable. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> The the fact that I can change up my style whenever I want &amp; they look &amp; feel natural.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t say anywhere that I read they came with adhesive already on them. The adhesive doesn&#x27;t stay stuck down and you cant but new adhesive over them. Oh well they were cheap enough I will manage.</li>
    <li> I dislike the pre attached glue which makes it difficult to apply my own. I am in looooovvvvveeeee with this product. I will continue to purchase this amazing bundle.</li>
    <li> These lashes feel like the ones I get at the drugstore. U can do a dramatic look or more natural with the choices u get in the box. And they last all day with no iritation</li>
    <li> looks amazing! so many different options I love it</li>
    <li> The lashes are soft and pretty dramatic but the problem is each lashes comes with heavy glue, it was not possible to remove it, after put on my duo glue it doesn&#x27;t blend in well, it looks totally fake. THEY ARE NOT GOOD FOR DAILY WEAR.  I will keep it just for dress up or Halloween stuff. Better spend a bit more money on the product which look more natural and blend in better with your eyes.  I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> These lashes are a terrific deal, and so much fun!  I will be purchasing them again.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes break as you pull them off the plastic. Also, they are really long so they have to be cut down to size. Terrible quality and not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. The box that they came in was bent up so I had to put tape on it. There was one lash that was missing a Little bit of hair on it, so it left a gap in the lash hairs. But other than those two issues I love these lashes.</li>
    <li> The band on these is very wide and dark, but will blend in with heavy black eye liner. Some of the eye lashes are a bit on the extreme end, but I just cut those in half and use for corner lashes. Most of the strips have to be trimmed off, and extra glue pulled off before they can be applied even the first time. All in all a good buy.</li>
    <li> The number of lashes when compared to the price is great! The quality of lashes are okay. ehere the lashes attach to your eyelids is made of a very stiff plastic and tends to not adhere as well to the corner of your eyes, making the effort of keeping them on a pain.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes :D So much variety, I wish the eyelash band was thinner or clear but other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> The price is great and I really wanted to work; however these lashes are very thick and hard making the ends of the lashes constantly pop out. The lashes also where much more dramatic than what I tough. I’m not going to be using these lashes at all!!&lt;br /&gt;I think this are best for people that like very dramatic lashes with a thick band and are used to false lashes</li>
    <li> I know what you are thinking. \\&quot;How bad can they be?\\&quot; \\&quot;The price is just so amazing!\\&quot; \\&quot;Those other girls just don&#x27;t know what that are doing!\\&quot; Well, that&#x27;s what I thought anyway, and I am sorry to say, I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I wear lashes every day as part of my regular makeup. I typically buy drug store or brands and I&#x27;m not really picky. I have tried many styles and brands and I have only come across a couple styles that I don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;So on to these lashes...The band is thick but that&#x27;s not really the  problem here. The problem is that they are coated with a thick layer of that stretchy glue. It took me 10 minutes to remove it from one pair. I was able to take off just enough so the band wouldn&#x27;t be bumpy and would sit flush against my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Next issue, these are so inflexible! I flexed them in a horseshoe shape like I do with all lashes while waiting for the glue to become tacky. They basically just stayed in a stiff U shape that was impossible to place on my eye. Sigh. Once I got them into place, they felt heavy and irritating. I was constantly aware of them on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Even if I had better luck applying these, none of them are really very flattering. There isn&#x27;t one pair that&#x27;s just right, they all have something about them that&#x27;s just odd. Too long, too thick, to sparsely placed, not evenly spaced.&lt;br /&gt;I so wanted these to work but it&#x27;s just not meant to be. Try them for yourself if you must but prepare to be disappointed. I&#x27;m giving 2 stars only because I see some value in these for Halloween.</li>
    <li> got to my house on time they were gorgeous, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get to play with them before my dogs did so I&#x27;ll have to purchase new ones later on. They felt fantastic and looked gorgeous</li>
    <li> Pros:  This package contains 70 PAIRS of eyelashes.  That is a phenomenal quantity for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The band which adheres to the skin is a bit thick and heavy feeling.  Most of the eyelashes in the package are very dramatic and ones that I would not typically use.  I tend to prefer false eyelashes that &#x27;enhance&#x27; my natural eyes without being too over the top.  I want people to notice that my eyes look good without really checking to see if my eyelashes are false, you know?!  Unfortunately, this package only has two different types (20 pairs) that I would actually use.  But, even for this price it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I got this for a costume I was doing and ended up giving the rest to my girlfriend. There were a lot of styles so I experimented and found the one I liked best. They were pretty easy to apply and I got the look I needed for my costume. Of course they look a lot better on my girlfriend, probably because she uses them more often and knows how to apply them, but they&#x27;re good for costumes or for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Most were not realistic. Too thick or to wide.</li>
    <li> Really great price. I thought I was okay at putting on eyelashes, but I had always used the single packs, which are much easier to apply. I have practiced putting these on with probably 15 pairs, only to end up throwing each one away. Good thing there&#x27;s 55 more pairs! The strip isn&#x27;t really curved, and even using 3 types of different glues and watching YouTube instructional videos didn&#x27;t change its ability to stay on without lifting on one side. Still a good value, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get it down eventually.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was skeptical when ordering these lashes. A great price for a large number of good-quality lashes seemed unlikely. But I am very pleased with my purchase. I had to buy an applicator, and I did destroy a few pair on my first attempt, but the lashes are various thicknesses and lengths and make my eyes look amazing.</li>
    <li> The bundle came really fast after I had placed my order, so that&#x27;s a plus on shipping. Okay, I am a eyelash maniac and it is the feature on myself that I obsess over so I thought I hit the jackpot when I found this listing. It is an overall great product, a variety of styles for a low price. The quality was okay considering the price and amount. The only thing I would warn others about is that the eyelashes are pretty stiff. They don&#x27;t always bend quite enough to shape your eyes. And the thing that bothers me the most is that the glue that is already placed on the eyelashes (since we all know eyelashes have that pre-adhesive to stick to the box thing) is pretty thick. And was kind of carelessly applied. So on some spots, the glue runs further on the eyelash than other. I would just do my best to pull the glue off before applying mine. This bothered me because before these, I only ever bought the authentic human hair lashes that were like $4 a pair, so it was high quality. But other than those things, it&#x27;s a good buy for the price and would recommend it to anyone who wants a few different looks, likes lots of eyelashes, and doesn&#x27;t mind a little bit of a low quality. I love the fact that there are soooo many EYELASHES &#x3D;O</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These are not soft like regular lashes. Plastic feel and not comfortable for long time wear.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The lashes are really stiff and hard to get to stay on , and unless you are a performer you can&#x27;t even use half of these because most of them are way to dramatic..</li>
    <li> Really liked the eye lashes...</li>
    <li> lashes are a bit heavy and easy to tell they are fake. Most styles I can&#x27;t zip my real lashes into them so I still have 2 rows of lashes on my eyes.</li>
    <li> These are great. You do have to trim them a bit or else they could look ridiculous and feel uncomfortable since they are plastic. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Best deal out here .... For someone who does lashes every single day this is great. The styles are fun great for day and night. Short, thick, long, thin....... Love</li>
    <li> Love me some lashes. These are not bad for the bulk of them. Some are better than others. However, I like the big and bold so I am totally into them.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! Several styles to choose from within the package. Love the different looks I can create!</li>
    <li> Great eyelashes!! Arrived in perfect condition. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them.</li>
    <li> Some of the lashes were uneven, but I think it was pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> i order these eyelashes for my wife for a present for Christmas the only bad thing about these eyelashes are that they are plastic  not real hair</li>
    <li> Great value. There&#x27;s some styles I can&#x27;t see myself wearing but overall there are so many lashes and so many options. The material looks sort of plasticky but the lashes look great.</li>
    <li> There are several layers of lashes in this box but unfortunately most are so thick that they could only be used for Halloween.  I had bought this product before and three layers were thin enough for daily wear. The last shipment was disappointing.  I am looking for another eyelash vendor.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loved it.  Best bang for your buck.  Comes in a nice box and with this many lashes, you won&#x27;t have to buy so many singles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and my husband bought these for me thinking that buying a bundle is better than buying the individual ARDELL brands. He read the reviews and thought these would work for me. I gave them a try and there are pros and cons to these.. THE PROS:  can&#x27;t beat the price for the quantity. easy to apply. looks great once applied. and they come however thick you want them. THE CONS: these lashes are all plastic, no real feel about them. Except for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lashes the rest are hard to blend/seal in with mascara. The thicker lashes are hard plastic and heavy on the eyes. There is nothing &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking about them. If you are one of the unlucky ones who has super straight lashes and if you&#x27;d want to blend your lashes in with the falsies you will fail because after you apply mascara your lashes will still stick out and separate because the false lashes have no grip to the mascara. Overall the quality of the lashes is not that great. Most of my clients hated how they felt once they were applied so I use these for myself only  and I went back to using Ardell Brand for my clients.</li>
    <li> i like and recommend this item because i liked the way they feel and look not plastic looking at all.</li>
    <li> this is my 2nd purchase and i love them because i can change my look every week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> There were really only about two trays that I&#x27;d consider using (the rest not very natural looking). The band that must be attached is quite thick and inflexible, and very difficult to apply with standard adhesive. The ends keep popping up. I do Ok with store bought ones, but several of these I&#x27;ve ended up not being able to use as a result (as they are so rigid and naturally want to pop up on the ends). I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but perhaps are more suited to the very experienced user.</li>
    <li> Not sure if the lashes are human hair or not or if I can re-use them but I love them. I love the selection</li>
    <li> These lashes are great. I appreciate being able to use just what I ned where i need it.</li>
    <li> Got here fast! They eyelashes are very pretty and made nicely. The price was also very nice! I was really surprised</li>
    <li> These are very pretty but I wouldn&#x27;t say they are necessarily for everyday use. Beautiful but some sets are really long and some very full and dark. I wear them every time I go out but not to work :)</li>
    <li> Love them &#x27; and they last very long ✌😌</li>
    <li> Great for practice but thats it. Unrealistic look to them but hey you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these lashes. There are several pairs that I may not use except on special occasions. But for the most part I&#x27;m having fun using most of these. Use these are kind of plastic like, but I don&#x27;t mind for the price. I&#x27;m able to clean them and reuse more than a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the project my daughter was working for her portfolio. The quality was pretty good, for brief wear. Not a huge falsie wearer, but they worked fine for check out the photos of use on [...]</li>
    <li> i like having thick bands because its easier to manage with fingers, (i don&#x27;t use appliances to put them on)&lt;br /&gt;i like the variety of it, some are natural and some are bold and dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;this can last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**USE DUO&lt;br /&gt;quality glues make these last longer as in they won&#x27;t fall off easily</li>
    <li> These lashes are perfect. All different lengths and thickness. They hold up very well. You may need to trim them though because they are a bit long for the eyelids.</li>
    <li> Cheap, but not terrible. They are a good value for what you are paying for them &amp; the fact that there are many different styles included is nice. I tried taking one out a little too fast and ended up ripping the lash so I had to throw it away. These are by no means mink lashes, but are fun to wear out.</li>
    <li> These lashes are so / so. The reason I give it a 3 is because many of the lashes are obnoxious. There are probably 2 types in the entire set I would wear. On the plus side, they weren&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
    <li> I wear falsies maybe 4 or 5 days a week. I change it up from natural for work to dramatic for play. This set has the best of both worlds. I don&#x27;t use the 2 most dramatic sets often but even if I threw those away the day the box arrived I&#x27;d be saving a BOATLOAD of money. At the drugstore or Sally&#x27;s you may get 1-2 pair for 4.99-7$. 70 pair for around $15 is insane. I bought these about a month ago and I still have plenty left. I had a girl just 2 days ago tell me she&#x27;d been staring at my lashes all day and wanted to know if they were natural. I told her no and she said she just could not tell they were fake and they were gorgeous. The only people that seem to know I&#x27;m wearing falsies at work are the people who also wear falsies. I use DUO white adhesive and I use the process of applying the glue directly to my lash line (not to the falsies) AFTER applying my liner. This gives me a foolproof application each and every time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It shipped on time. All of the lashes came just as pictured. I would have given this five stars, but the thinner more delicate lashes are a rather difficult to get off the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this product does not come with eyelash glue, you need to purchase it separately.</li>
    <li> Ive never used False lashes before and these were very easy to apply. I ordered DUO lash adhesive  along with this.</li>
    <li> These are good price for a lot of eyelashes they&#x27;re definitely not very natural and you can tell their little cheap but they work if you just want to get a lot of eyelashes.</li>
    <li> You get a lot for the money. But these are more meant to be used once and then thrown away.</li>
    <li> All pairs are different, but with so much choice you can always find them look better in the eyes, can be used many times, are of very good quality and long lasting</li>
    <li> $70 pairs of eyelashes for $15. You can&#x27;t beat that with a stick. And it has different sizes for different occasions. And super fat shipping!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived quick, lashes work well. I would order these If you do a lot of lashes for dance competition or if you wear different kinds of lashes on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> These lashes are NOT natural at all.  They are almost plastic looking and the sticky stuff stays on the lashes.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much i really loved them.</li>
    <li> Good quality fake eye lashes for the price, and for soooo many its steal! But they are not the easiest false lashes to put on, but you will have enough for a whole year with this set!</li>
    <li> I bought these because it was a bulk package for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I Like them, you have to cut the ends so it doesn&#x27;t feel super stiff and stab you.&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t like target or walmart brands though.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they are more feather and plastic like.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t include all of the lashes in the pictures, but for the price, I love these! Good flexibility in the band and good quality lashes! Take care of them and you can re-use.</li>
    <li> I really love these lashes their great just to have as back ups in my kit! of course the more thinner ones look more realistic but I love doing fantasy looks too so the thicker ones are perfect for it!!!!</li>
    <li> These lashes are very useful. I find it hard to find lashes that fit my eye without having to cut them but these fit perfectly. At first I didn&#x27;t think they were going to work well based on the material they&#x27;re made with but I found the more plastic/firm material made the process of applying them and removing glue from them much easier. I personally would have liked the option to select which styles I wanted because I have no real use for the first two thin lashes. I used them to double the thicker lashes for effect. Overall GREAT BUY. VERY HANDY AND DURABLE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be having a lot of fun! Perfect for an aspiring makeup artist to experiment with.</li>
    <li> These are really cute lashes and I love how it comes in all different styles! However, I like to reuse my lashes and as i was taking off the eyelash glue, the fibers of the falsies started to fall off. So i would say that they aren&#x27;t made extremely well like the single pairs you can get at beauty stores. I&#x27;m still giving these lashes 5 stars because it is such a good deal, especially with all the different styles!! It&#x27;s fun and flirty and ranges from natural looking to extremely dolly lashes!</li>
    <li> first of all, i use lashes on a daily basis. i prefer to use lashes instead of mascara - since, for me, it&#x27;s taking waaay less time rather than mascara,&lt;br /&gt;the hairs on these lashes are synthetic and the band is really thick, so the lashes didn&#x27;t look real at all. because of the thick band - putting on the lashes did NOT go on smoothly. they also felt really heavy on my eyes, and i just couldn&#x27;t wait to take them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re used to higher end lashes (example; ardell) - then these lashes won&#x27;t do you any justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the good thing about these lashes are the fact that they&#x27;re really inexpensive, you get a majority of different styles and the shipping was super fast. other than that, i would not buy these lashes again.</li>
    <li> bought these for my daughter who uses them regularly.  She re-uses them more than once...good set for a lash wearer!</li>
    <li> The lashes arrived in new condition in the box and were well-packaged. There is a lot of variety for all sorts of looks to try out. I feel the amount of lashes is great for how much it cost. I&#x27;m just happy they arrived perfectly in shape. I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with ordering beauty supplies but they made it on time and all of them are nice and new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some natural looking ones, dramatic ones, and everything in between. I held them and can assert that they are durable and can handle application and storage. They do not feel cheap and flimsy. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great quality lashes for the price!!  I do makeup and have already used several pairs and they did not disappoint.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I loved the various styles! There was not one type, I didn&#x27;t like... And I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have to order again for a few months.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that you get to change up your style everyday!!! great buy and I told many friends :)</li>
    <li> These lashes are a great quality!&lt;br /&gt;I love 6 out of the 7 different styles.&lt;br /&gt;And they are reusable. I can use the same pair 2-3 times!&lt;br /&gt;I love them!</li>
    <li> it was so much i sheared with a second mua friend and we have both bin looving them for every occation will reorder</li>
    <li> They feel like plastic and went straight in the garbage! Nasty looking things, too, except one layer in the box (top one) that seemed better made than the rest.</li>
    <li> The only thing I do not  like about these is that they do not last. They come apart very easily.</li>
    <li> it does not come with the glue :-(</li>
    <li> I choose these because the box had a 7 different styles to choose from and the fact that&lt;br /&gt;this box has 70 pairs which is good for me since I have  worn eye lashes in years so I new&lt;br /&gt;that I would have to practice until I get it right didn&#x27;t take me long got back into the swing&lt;br /&gt;of put them on, I can&#x27;t do without them now.</li>
    <li> These are amazing. Can&#x27;t nelieve the price. These came boxed and in perfect shape. Very natural looking and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed. I&#x27;ve seen much cheaper material lashes &amp; these are not it. They aren&#x27;t human hair or fur. But definitely good quality material lashes.  For the price, the quantity &amp; how fast I received my order. I WILL MOST DEFINITELY order again.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with the Eye Splashes 70 Pairs False Eye Lashes Bundle - 7 Styles. These will be a staple in my make-up kit and I believe my clients are going to love them as much as I do. I’ve only worn 2 styles as of this past Thursday (1/29/15), but I’m having a ball just to see what different looks I can achieve. I love how durable they are and I’ve worn the natural pair at least 3 times since I got them. I’m definitely gonna try other styles by this brand. #wortheverydime #deslashescompletethebeathunty</li>
    <li> For beginner it&#x27;s great product.. I m having fun with this kit.</li>
    <li> I am wearing fake lashes for everyday use as I have gotten older and I do not have big thick lashes anymore. I have purchased Ardell from the drug store and really like them a lot, but they are expensive for using everyday. I order these for the price, knowing if they were not usuable, I would not be too upset given the cost, and I could always give them to some one to use for something. So I watched reviews on YouTube...which were about 50/50 as well as reading the reviews on Amazon which also had a 50/50 approval. I will state these are not as soft and good as Ardell or other well known brands, they are plasic and have a heavier band than I prefer, but they are wearable and I do receive complements on my make-up when wearing these and most people do not know what I have done different, so many of the different styles are natural looking. For my preference I cut each lash in half and wear only the half at the outer part of my lash to give me a little more volume and length on the top outer part of my eyelashes. I use Duo glue and it holds verywell. I am able to clean the lash and re use it the next day. These are not the $5.00 per pair lashes you buy elsewhere, but if you have a tight budget and love false lashes...then these are for you. You can trim and modify to suit your needs. You will need to wear dark eyeliner to camoflouge the heavy black band. I think my next order will be the lashes with a clear band.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using fake lashes for 6 years now.. And these the price is right for the quantity but not the quality. I read some said you just got to know how to put them on... Wrong. These if you are used to ale lashes you know how easy they are to apply and the top doesn&#x27;t have a thick line like liner.. But these do and that&#x27;s what makes it difficult to put on. These aren&#x27;t your average lashes you get at a cvs store. But if your patient you will be able to get them on it&#x27;s a pain but like I said for the price 70 beautiful lashes why not</li>
    <li> The part you glue to your eye is hard and thick making it harder to disguise and remove. Takes more glue as well to apply.</li>
    <li> This is a true pack. The lash lines are thin on some of them. The material is like a plastic fiber of some sort. In order to make them work, you must bend them to keep them from being so stiff. Also, clear mascara is useful.</li>
    <li> Great for any look you&#x27;re after! Gonna buy some more for my daughter and some more for me too! Great for the price!</li>
    <li> they were not appealing at all, never used them.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moKYBDXU43L0D2]]</li>
    <li> Good quality and variety!</li>
    <li> They are Perfect quality and delivered on time!</li>
    <li> Great variety of black lashes for the price</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but after reading several of the negative comments about this product I just wanted to offer my experience. Being an almost daily false eyelash wearer, who lives in a small town with limited (and expensive) falsie options, this was a chance I was willing to take. and I am so pleased with my purchase, with my prime I spent fifteen dollars, that would have gotten me three pairs of lashes where I live. the quality is great, certainly no worse than what I am used to. now if you are inexperienced in wearing false lashes I expect ANY lashes you get to be difficult, practice makes perfect, and with lash wearing a lot of practice. but a good lash is made long, so that it can be cut to fit individual eyes, and somewhat stiff because again, they can be played with to form a match best for you. the variety offered is wonderful, and while I saw complaints about the thicker lashes being ridiculous, as far as I&#x27;m concerned I&#x27;ve worn far more &amp;#34;ridiculous&amp;#34; and with the right make up, at the right event, I believe most lashes can work. this is a great buy, and when I run out, months and months from now I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> a little stiff and a lot of them I actually wouldn&#x27;t even wear.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Last me months.</li>
    <li> Although I purchased the eye wear months ago I just used them today and I must say they are so easy to put on especially for my first time ever doing them myself!!!!!</li>
    <li> These were an even higher quality than expected. I am someone who has tried quite a few brands of false eyelashes, these definitely being the best. Posted pictures below of one of the more dramatic sets (one was a selfie for halloween haha) Love them!!</li>
    <li> The whole set is very plastic and fake. Very uncomfortable on my eyes.</li>
    <li> The best eyelashes that I ever bought! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great variety of lashes!</li>
    <li> Amazing!! A lot of diferent eye lashes!! Really good product!</li>
    <li> I love these the most.  They are easy to use and I have multiple choices.</li>
    <li> I started using younique&#x27;s 3D fiber mascara and it looks way better and more natural than falsies. Plus its super easy to put on, its just like mascara. And its natural so no fillers or chemicals. I get mine from lashalert.com</li>
    <li> I like the variety of eyelashes and the durability of most of them. However , some of the eyelashes I would never use and look cheap .</li>
    <li> I am in a different mood every day so having ten different styles of lashes is perfect for me! They are a great fit and even though they are false lashes, they don&#x27;t look plastic.</li>
    <li> really fun for those &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; really great for those not playing. wide variety - I&#x27;d say half serious lashes and half unreal looking definitely false looking lashes in this kit.</li>
    <li> I lovee them!!!!! They are perfect i bought them twice now they are perfect i recomend them!! They look fully natural and all my friends ask me where i buy them and people ask me if they are mine!!</li>
    <li> When I saw seventy pairs of lashes for this price, I decided Amazon was the actual Holy Land. As a makeup artist who isn&#x27;t Youtube (or otherwise) famous, I have to pay for all my own products, no freebies, and quality lashes rack up a terrifying expense. All the lashes in this kit are gorgeous and versatile, and easy to apply. Absolutely love the fact that it includes a selection of natural, everyday, and dramatic lashes. Most of the styles could easily be cut in half to use as demi lashes, or cut into thirds to apply each piece individually, which is often easier for beginners. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> So, first of all, I was pretty skeptical that these were going to be legit. This is SO CHEAP for 70 pairs. I&#x27;m a lash fanatic for all occasions and I have learned how to properly put them on. If you hate these lashes, that probably means that you just don&#x27;t know how to put them on. Sorry, but true. But, I&#x27;m going to give you a few extra tips for these lashes in a minute. I do want to say that this set truly has a great variety of lashes... and one pair of lashes that I have on right now, I&#x27;ve had on for THREE days... which is insane to me. Typically they are too uncomfortable, or they poke my eyelid skin at some point, begin going different directions and look ridiculous etc, etc, etc. I&#x27;ve used MAC lashes which honestly aren&#x27;t any better than Ardell at quadruple the price. So I quit that crazy habit. I use Duo to apply them. These lashes are a bit thicker at the base and not as bendable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing is first, put the duo/glue or whatever on the base of the lashes and PLAY with them bending them in different directions for about 20-30 seconds. THEN begin actually applying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, after you have them on- they may look like there is a gap between your real lashes and the fake ones. Give it one minute to set, and then pinch your lashes with the fake ones together all the way across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, after a minute or two, curl the lashes. These curl really well and it again helps combine your lashes with the fake ones making them look very real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seriously look amazing. Will definitely be buying this set again!!! Good luck!</li>
    <li> I was so excited until I realized the bands are too thick and that the lashes literally stick straight out of my face. The thinner styles look barely there. and the thicker more glamours lashes look gorgeous they just don&#x27;t bend to fit my eyes. I really wanted to love this product.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. All my clients love them.</li>
    <li> These have no give, they&#x27;re rigid and very hard to put on.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good quality for price.</li>
    <li> Although they look really shiny and some of them look really fake. While wearing the natural looking long ones I was approached by 6 guys in one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lashes themselves don&#x27;t poke at the corners which is an issue for me with most of the lashes I buy. The lashes don&#x27;t move a bunch like ardells but are still great. 10/10 would buy again but I&#x27;m glad I have 70, guess I won&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Bands are very hard and not very flexible. Giving 3 stars now.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Great item! Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Came very fast all the eyelashes look great and do not look cheap</li>
    <li> Wow what a steal!!! These eyelashes aren&#x27;t the best quality, but they are still fun to use. Although the quality isn&#x27;t so great, you get them at a steal. I&#x27;ve worn these and always get tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> happy different sizes</li>
    <li> I love these yes you might have to trim them but they last a long time I most definitely will purchase again</li>
    <li> These are GREAT quality! I love that I have a variety to choose from. I cut them a little shorter to fit my eyes better.</li>
    <li> These are the worst lashes I&#x27;ve ever used.  They have no curve and a sticky layer that effects the adhesive (the sticky layer doesn&#x27;t keep the lashes on so you have to use adhesive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent 5.95 at Walmart and got 6 pairs of lashes.  I can apply the adhesive and have both lashes on in less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that means &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Very good and lasts long with a good eyelash glue would recommend to people who wear lashes on a daily basis</li>
    <li> First things first, I am by no means an expert at false eyelashes. It took me 20 minutes to get these on. I will not try them again unless my someone else puts them on for me!  Besides that, I have a few pros and cons about these eye lashes by Salona. First of all, the box they came in was just terrible. It wouldn&#x27;t even stay together. Second, they didn&#x27;t even come with adhesive to attach them. I had to go to the store and pick some up. Big disappointment if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, there are 70 pairs. Gives you room for mistakes and enough to last you a while especially for the price. These are not high quality lashes but they work fine especially for a beginner. Overall, if you have experience with lashes, they are not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great deal lasted me a while, for my personal use and on clients, still have some left will be making another purchase real soon.</li>
    <li> Great!! The lashes are fun for dramatic and every day looks as a makeup artist this came in handy the delivery was fast and on time will buy again</li>
    <li> They are a little bulky and come off easily. They take quite a while to apply, but if you have time they can look nice.</li>
    <li> Got it for the ms&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;doesnt even touch it, best buy ever</li>
    <li> The lashes are hard and do not mold to my eye line nicely. Because they are so stiff, it isn&#x27;t easy to apply. I wouldn&#x27;t order these again.</li>
    <li> I love these because I get 7 different pairs of styles that I can use. They last a couple uses which is great!</li>
    <li> I have never worn fake lashes before (besides on Halloween) and wanted to try something new! Their gorgeous! I just don&#x27;t like the style of two of them. But other than that. Their PERF</li>
    <li> Okay i got these today anf:)d i absolutly fell in love!!!!! I been wearing eyelashes for 12 years and im a cosmotologist work at Sephora... i must say i am impressed of the quality i usualy dont buy on amazon but i had to see and try them because i usually spend 100 dollars worth on lashes but now i have 70 pairs will keep an update this week and show pictures</li>
    <li> The base is really thick but they are all fantastic. But because the base is so thick that I have to wear a lot of makeup to look realistic. But they are great I wear ever size but the last two thick ones</li>
    <li> love how it makes my eyes appear</li>
    <li> I purchased these thinkin it was an awsome deal... but if ur lookin for everyday natural lashes these are not it. They are extremely full &amp; dramatic.</li>
    <li> 5 Star Plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a MUA (make-up artist) you are either working for a top or well stocked brand with an abundance of false lashes. There may be little need for these, it makes sense. You may also be a freelance artist sans supplies and this is where these are the 5 star plus at the quantity you are getting here is amazing for the price. If you have applied a lot of lashes - these are not difficult as discussed below - but can see how they would be for a beginner. You will need to clip and trim ends, and give a few twists to soften the band - a little duo, and thats all that&#x27;s needed. Easy to recommend.</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t like the picture diffident even come with the glue like the pic and all of the lashes are the really made the same and are very fake looking like for costumes. I didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
    <li> Is Kim . I actually  buy these  about once a month. Like the long ones ,but not crazy about the thin ones.  I do my make up  for work as well as put it on others. Not for beginners,  but fabulous  on the big ones  if you know what you&#x27;re  doing :)</li>
    <li> Really great lashes for the price.</li>
    <li> They hurt when u put them on. Not flexible at all... would not get them again</li>
    <li> With mostly good reviews I decided to see these for myself. These are nothing like what I expected. I knew they weren&#x27;t human hair. I&#x27;ve used others that are synthetic. I just didn&#x27;t expect these to one look so fake and two look like they were packed in someone&#x27;s home. The assortment is nice and the price is great. However the quality for me just doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more for better quality. Especially when it comes to putting something on my eye lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further what was most disturbing for me was finding a long red hair stuck to one of the lases. I&#x27;m just completely grossed out.</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews on these and even went on you tube to search. They got pretty good reviews. I don&#x27;t think I agree. Their spine is very large and not comfortable. They also don&#x27;t mold very well. There is an excessive about of adhesive on them so it&#x27;s hard to get them off of the backing and then they get stretched out. I&#x27;m sorry I spent so much. You can buy nicer lashes at other wholesales sites.</li>
    <li> These were a hit.  2nd best Christmas present, said my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> It is not good for Asian eyes.</li>
    <li> The bands are too thick and no matter what brand glue, how much or little you use they won&#x27;t stick to your eye. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am a theatre teacher and I buy a huge pack of these 2x a year.  The are awesome!  They are the cheapest I have found and are a good quality.  We only wear them one day at a time/ you could probably clean them and where them 2x, but I worry about germs and contamination.  The teenage girls can put them on by them selves.  There are several different types/styles in the pack.  Most of them are pretty full, not really a natural type look if that is what you are going for.</li>
    <li> these eyelashes are terrible! they are stuck on the plastic with glue that ruins the lashes... do not buy these.</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes, the different kinds that come in the pack are a great variety, and the apply well!</li>
    <li> Nice bulk&lt;br /&gt;Decent price&lt;br /&gt;Quality Okay. Not best.</li>
    <li> I love how many there are. You have to work the lashes, kind of stiff, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. The eyelashes are alrighhhhhht I guess? Not completely intolerable. I&#x27;ll be spending the extra next time for higher quality.</li>
    <li> Great amount of eyelashes.  Many to choose from, not all the same. fits perfectly. No glue but I bought mine separate.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Ok if you don&#x27;t mind a super fake looking lash or won&#x27;t be close-up to anyone. (stage actors, maybe??)  But these are not made of individual fibers/hairs, they are literally strips of plasticky material cut into lash shapes. Maybe for some people, not for me. I&#x27;ll save these for Halloween.</li>
    <li> These are cheaper looking eye lashes, but for the price it&#x27;s not bad. The are pretty on, good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Didnt realize they were actually just plastic. They have no actual eyelash shape. Usable but they dont make your eyes pop as much.</li>
