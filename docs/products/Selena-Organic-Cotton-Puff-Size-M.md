      <li>Aside from the slow delivery, the package came in and I was impressed.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the quick delivery time love the product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Japanese kind but not like this</li>
      <li>super fast delivery</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty well for wicking an RDA.</li>
      <li>Exactly what we wanted 😁</li>
      <li>It should last even the most avid user for months or even years.</li>
      <li>Works well for all kinds of wicking ;)</li>
      <li>/&gt;You get a ton of it, first off.  </li>
      <li>Top quality Japanese Organic cotton just as described.</li>
      <li>Flavor us stellar</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and will certainly be purchasing from Samurai Japan again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super soft and very absorbent.</li>
      <li>and I have so much of this stuff.</li>
      <li>Absolutely what I wanted for my rda.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t throw an unusual taste or smell when vaped with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Product arrived opened but got here fast.</li>
      <li>It cuts and wicks very well for this purpose.</li>
      <li>I liked this size (medium) better than the large because I have much less waste when rewicking.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple and clean.</li>
      <li>Good for wicking, and inexpensive enough to use to wipe down juice leaks, too.</li>
      <li>High quality fast shipping highly recommended for vaping applications</li>
      <li>&#x27;s got a natural cream color to it, meaning it hasn&#x27;t been bleached.  </li>
      <li>So, when I saw this package I had to jump on it, and so far, I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Performance/flavor is pretty much the same although the puffs are a little easier to work with (pulls through coils a bit easier when I need a tighter wick) due to them not having the compressed outside layer that the Shiseido pads do.</li>
      <li>Yes its slightly tan in color with traditional dark specs often found in true organic unbleached cotton.</li>
      <li>Japanese Organic Cotton can be very hard to find for a cheap price, unless you want to wait a month for it to arrive.  </li>

<li> It was alright, but over priced for the fact that you can basically get the same product from Wal-Mart for much cheaper and the sheets were to thin</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little loose, doesn&#x27;t roll too well but gets the job done.</li>
<li> The cotton does not change the taste of the vapor juice and lasts me anywhere between 5 days to a week and a half before I have to re wick my coil.</li>
<li> well and doesn&#x27;t mess with my flavour.</li>
<li> They do not leave small bits of cotton on your face when they catch on hair.</li>
<li> You can tell it&#x27;s organic because it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty smells or tastes to it</li>

    <li> Exactly as shown came in nice packing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cotton to use in my atomizer. It cuts and wicks very well for this purpose. It should last even the most avid user for months or even years. As a bonus, my wife can use them for makeup, etc. if she runs out of regular bleached cotton.</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as Ko Gen Do.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME cotton for use in a rebuildable such as my Kayfun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a ton of it, first off.  Japanese Organic Cotton can be very hard to find for a cheap price, unless you want to wait a month for it to arrive.  So, when I saw this package I had to jump on it, and so far, I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a natural cream color to it, meaning it hasn&#x27;t been bleached.  You can tell it&#x27;s organic because it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty smells or tastes to it (yes, I did in fact chew on a piece of this cotton).  It doesn&#x27;t throw an unusual taste or smell when vaped with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Great amount for the price, feels soft and fluffy, and cuts easily into near perfect strips every time you need to change cotton. Love it</li>
    <li> purchased for vaping. easy to wick. compared to KJD i can&#x27;t tell a difference in flavor, although texture is slightly different. Will purchase again and recommend.</li>
    <li> I plan on sticking with this for my RDA wicking, best all around flavor and super wicking abilities!  I used to favor cotton balls then cloud chasers organic cotton string.  This cotton is the best hands down, great for tanks and even better in an RDA! Yes its slightly tan in color with traditional dark specs often found in true organic unbleached cotton. If u try it and like it review it here please more people should know about this stuff.</li>
    <li> super fast delivery the product is amazing I&#x27;ve never used anything like it I&#x27;ve used Japanese kind but not like this</li>
    <li> Works amazing on my vape</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick delivery time love the product</li>
    <li> High quality fast shipping highly recommended for vaping applications</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little loose, doesn&#x27;t roll too well but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great quality product. They do not leave small bits of cotton on your face when they catch on hair. Works great to use in mouth with peroxide to disinfect a wound or mouth sore.</li>
    <li> Great product for rebuilding coils...the best quality I have used and priced great....superior wicking...shipping was prompt and I would definitely order again but this package will probably last me 20 years.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly. Top quality Japanese Organic cotton just as described. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and will certainly be purchasing from Samurai Japan again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, bang for the buck still have more than half of it left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t wick too well, but is good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to get good flavor burn off juice 2 times and you should be set</li>
    <li> Bought this stuff for my RDA and after a puff or two there is no nasty aftertaste. Don&#x27;t pay retail for Japanese cotton in vape stores! This stuff works just as well.</li>
    <li> [Using as vaping supplies] Shipping was seriously fast (arrived before a couple of other things I order before this) and in perfect condition. Picked these up for wicking after using Shiseido pads for close to a year. Performance/flavor is pretty much the same although the puffs are a little easier to work with (pulls through coils a bit easier when I need a tighter wick) due to them not having the compressed outside layer that the Shiseido pads do. I&#x27;ve been sticking with these since I got &#x27;em so all in all - couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;(These being less expensive than most is definitely a plus too)</li>
    <li> I use this for my RDAs and rebuildable deck section on my Zephyrus sub ohm tank. It&#x27;s very nice cotton. The best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s super soft and very absorbent. Very clean with no weird smells or break in taste.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, perfect for rebuildable rda&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Good for wicking, and inexpensive enough to use to wipe down juice leaks, too. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Really good wicking material. Flavor us stellar</li>
    <li> Love the cotton for wicking my coils</li>
    <li> I use these to cut my own wicks for vaping, they work perfectly!</li>
    <li> This cotton is amazing for building coils will have enough for a while to come, thinking of purchasing a couple of more so i will be set for years. Thanks for not over charging for awesome products.</li>
    <li> We use this to build wicks for our vaporizers. Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Just got it and am in love already. This should last me for months!</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted 😁</li>
    <li> Aside from the slow delivery, the package came in and I was impressed. It certainly is much bigger than it looks and it has a ton of cotton in it. I will have enough cotton for a while and the price was great.</li>
    <li> It was alright, but over priced for the fact that you can basically get the same product from Wal-Mart for much cheaper and the sheets were to thin</li>
    <li> Works great as wicking material for a Subtank mini vaporizer. Doesn&#x27;t color the flavor of your e-liquid.</li>
    <li> Great for your RDA builds. Probably a lifetime supply.</li>
    <li> Great Quality cotton, Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> Wicks great, nice size, decent price. I received it 3 days ahead of schedule. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for wick material.</li>
    <li> Great for the vape, super absorbent and easy to work with</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well for wicking an RDA. I would say it is a good alternative to KohGenDo.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about it was the fact it took 2 months to ship, but I guess its because it ships from Japan.</li>
    <li> Product arrived opened but got here fast. Sending it back for contamination issues.</li>
    <li> Absolutely what I wanted for my rda. It&#x27;s simple and clean. Wicks well and doesn&#x27;t mess with my flavour. Also burning it just makes it taste burnt not actually darkening it. Most definitely worth the investment. I will have wicking material until 2016 for damn sure. Also side note had a tooth pulled and was still bleeding and I ran out of gauze. I used this instead cuz f*** it I didn&#x27;t want to go anywhere and I have so much of this stuff. Works well for all kinds of wicking ;)</li>
    <li> This product was just what I was looking for, I use these cotton pads to wick coils inside of vaporizers, the cotton works great for my Subox Mini kit&#x27;s included RBA deck. For the price you pay and the amount of pads you get, this is a no-brainier for anyone just getting into rebuilding coils. The cotton does not change the taste of the vapor juice and lasts me anywhere between 5 days to a week and a half before I have to re wick my coil. I also use these cotton sheets to clean my face which is what their advertised for, they work great that way too. I&#x27;d recommend this product to any vaping enthusiast and someone just wanting to clean their face or remove makeup!</li>
    <li> This is awesome cotton at an awesome price! I love how &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; the product is!</li>
    <li> I liked this size (medium) better than the large because I have much less waste when rewicking. Great stuff.</li>
