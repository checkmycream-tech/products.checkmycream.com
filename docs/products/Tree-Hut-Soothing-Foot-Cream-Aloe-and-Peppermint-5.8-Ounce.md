      <li>oh my so good for the feet.</li>
      <li>Really good products all your products a really good</li>
      <li>oI was surprised and impressed at the very nice quality.</li>
      <li>I really love this foot lotion !  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this foot cream!</li>
      <li>I love this foot cream!</li>
      <li>Real smooth.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>and I liked those too, so</li>
      <li>The tingle from the peppermint feels nice on your feet</li>
      <li>Works super well and it a great value.</li>
      <li>I found that using the foot scraper is much more effective.</li>
      <li>I think this is fabulous, not to strong smelling but very nice peppermint</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, but not quite as good as the diabetic lotion I normally use.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent and how it feels on your feet.</li>
      <li>but then I tried Tree Hut to see if it would do any better and the results were much better.</li>
      <li>But if someone cares about this, most of the ingredients are not organic, except the shea butter.</li>
      <li>It smells nice &amp; makes my feet feel smooth &amp; leaves a refreshing feeling.</li>
      <li>but my feet love it.</li>
      <li>Now my favorite foot cream.</li>
      <li>I love the Tree Hut brand.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>plus I love the peppermint feel and smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is a very strong peppermint, which is fine for me, though some might not like it.</li>
      <li>Even when my feet or very dry &amp; cracked it works great!</li>
      <li>You folks at Tree Hut really know how to make some seriously good and quality skin care products.</li>
      <li>Spread easily, non-greasy, absorbs easily&lt;</li>
      <li>My friend told me this was great stuff, and I liked that it does have the peppermint in it, but while the Gold Bond Diabetic cream is a little better at softening.  </li>
      <li>Smells really good but takes a kind of long time to get soothing.</li>
      <li>Great smell, absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft.</li>
      <li>but my feet just never got smooth using this product.  </li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t think this one is cruelty free (i.e. no animal testing) unless the manufacturer just doesn&#x27;t advertise on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The peppermint is strong but not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>However, for the price, I am pretty pleased.</li>
      <li>In case you&#x27;re womdering I did the right thing and gave it to my Mom!</li>
      <li>Has a pleasant smell (not very strong), kinda like mint chocolate chip ice cream, which is my bf&#x27;s favorite</li>
      <li>Others in the same price range are not as good.</li>
      <li>Awesome for my tired, pregnant feet!</li>
      <li>Using this along with Tree Hut Exfoliating Foot Scrub, Peppermint and Sugar has made a tremendous difference in how my feet look and feel.</li>
      <li>Not only do I love the scent of this, but I love the way it makes my feet feel.</li>
      <li>Wow, refreshing, cool moisturizing cream.  </li>
      <li>Not only is this thicker consistency moisturizing, but its properties are very soothing indeed and leave me a nice treat!</li>
      <li>For the first time in two years...NO PAIN!</li>
      <li>and it really does smell good enough to taste (though I don&#x27;t recommend it).</li>
      <li>Custmer for life right here.</li>
      <li>but if you just have regular old dry skin that needs moisturizing and a nice cooling soothe, this is a good product.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more of this foot cream for myself</li>
      <li>but it just takes more time and product to get the same effect.</li>
      <li>I would say it&#x27;s better than a lot of the similar products out there.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands of peppermint foot lotion over the years.</li>
      <li>do soak my feet for 10 minutes first.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I personally like a stronger peppermint presence and one that leaves my feet tingling more than this one.</li>
      <li>The lotion also makes your feet feel so soft and cool.  </li>
      <li>The peppermint is nice and combined with the aloe feels good on tired feet especially after scrubbing off calluses with a pumice stone or file.</li>
      <li>The pain and burning don&#x27;t completely go away, but it helps a lot, and works quickly.</li>
      <li>Makes my tired feet feel refreshed and cool and really moisturizes my feet, smells good too.</li>
      <li>A pretty decent deal for foot cream.</li>
      <li>This foot cream is great,I recommend it highly !</li>
      <li>This really is soothing.  </li>
      <li>This has been working really well.</li>
      <li>I think I expected more</li>
      <li>I buy this stuff every other month and love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found two new favorites!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this/these 2 products.</li>
      <li>I have such dry feet and have tried so many foot lotions that just don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>My feet were much softer and I did like the clear ingredients label.</li>
      <li>I really like that there are lots of natural ingredients in it and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
      <li>The thing is that this stuff works really well, and it is cheaper than most of the other foot creams out there that smell worse and cost more.</li>
      <li>I have tried many creams for my rough feet, but this is the stuff I keep coming back to.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this lotion to anyone who wants soft feet.  </li>
      <li>my feet are so soft.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your skin soft without toxins/chemicals.</li>
      <li>And because I go through so much peppermint foot lotion, I would definitely repurchase this one.</li>
      <li>have to admit that I haven&#x27;t found any so far.</li>
      <li>This lotion is thick &amp; creamy and has a light peppermint scent.</li>
      <li>Usually I buy lower end for body care, but after I started with Tree Hut, I find I&#x27;m getting very very decent skin care creams and body wash without paying excessively high prices.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and rich but does not leave my feet greasy.  </li>
      <li>It penetrates well, and even though the smell is very heavy, it&#x27;s not a big deal since I use it right before bed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> i use in the evenings every other night and it works, my feet have never been so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I do soak my feet for 10 minutes first.</li>
    <li> Now my favorite foot cream.</li>
    <li> Not the best product I&#x27;ve had so I guess it just depends on how bad off your feet are.  If they are at a therapeutic level of dryness this may not do the trick but if you just have regular old dry skin that needs moisturizing and a nice cooling soothe, this is a good product.  It does work on tough skin too but it just takes more time and product to get the same effect.</li>
    <li> I think this is fabulous, not to strong smelling but very nice peppermint and you feel a coolig affect on your feet.</li>
    <li> Makes my tired feet feel refreshed and cool and really moisturizes my feet, smells good too.</li>
    <li> Real smooth.  No tingle</li>
    <li> Feels amazing and smells great. Awesome for my tired, pregnant feet!</li>
    <li> This really is soothing.  The peppermint is nice and combined with the aloe feels good on tired feet especially after scrubbing off calluses with a pumice stone or file.</li>

    <li> Works super well and it a great value. I replaced a $28 Aveda product with this stuff</li>
    <li> I bought this foot cream for my Mom- I tried a little on my hand and when I smelled it and felt the consistency oI was surprised and impressed at the very nice quality. The thought crossed my mind to keep it for myself! In case you&#x27;re womdering I did the right thing and gave it to my Mom! I will definitely be ordering more of this foot cream for myself (I stand and walk around quite a bit at work) and am planning on purchasing for my sister who is diabetic with the accompanying foot nerve pain. Tree Hut&#x27;s Peppermint Foot Cream contains Aloe Vera and Peppermint which will soothe and comfort your feet. You folks at Tree Hut really know how to make some seriously good and quality skin care products. Usually I buy lower end for body care, but after I started with Tree Hut, I find I&#x27;m getting very very decent skin care creams and body wash without paying excessively high prices. Thank you for your wonderful and affordable products! Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> I really love this foot lotion !  It has a great smell !  It smells like Vanilla Mint.  The lotion also makes your feet feel so soft and cool.  I would definitely recommend this lotion to anyone who wants soft feet.  Rebecca Michigan</li>
    <li> I use this daily and I also use the Tree Hut Exfoliating Foot Scrub weekly.  I can honestly say this is the best foot cream I have ever used!  It&#x27;s thick and rich but does not leave my feet greasy.  I have very sensitive skin and I can use this product every day.  It smells wonderful and my feet look like I have had a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I love this foot cream! It smells nice &amp; makes my feet feel smooth &amp; leaves a refreshing feeling. Even when my feet or very dry &amp; cracked it works great!</li>
    <li> Smells really good but takes a kind of long time to get soothing. My feet were much softer and I did like the clear ingredients label. The peppermint is strong but not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found two new favorites! Using this along with Tree Hut Exfoliating Foot Scrub, Peppermint and Sugar has made a tremendous difference in how my feet look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a peppermint foot cream for my heels which dry out and become cracked. This has been working really well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Not only do I love the scent of this, but I love the way it makes my feet feel. Before I started using this, my feet were always dry and regular lotion didn&#x27;t just cut it. Not only is this thicker consistency moisturizing, but its properties are very soothing indeed and leave me a nice treat!</li>
    <li> Wow, refreshing, cool moisturizing cream.  Immediate relief and I will purchase again</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I found a bottle at Wal-Mart, then could never find it again. So glad Amazon carries it!! Works great. I don&#x27;t use it just for feet either.</li>
    <li> or any where else you like peppermint but my feet love it. It absorbs and it pepperminty without being greasy. love it.</li>
    <li> My feet feel like they are being hit with a flamethrower 24/7. I tried everything. Until I went to a clinic and the foot specialist gave me a rub down with this stuff after a soaking. For the first time in two years...NO PAIN! Custmer for life right here.</li>
    <li> I have such dry feet and have tried so many foot lotions that just don&#x27;t work very well.  This has become my #1 choice.  It keeps my feet moisturized all day plus I love the peppermint feel and smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. I&#x27;m going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Would recommend! My feet feels wonderful and the scent is unique!</li>
    <li> I love the Tree Hut brand. Costco had it last Christmas, but no this year so I found it on Amazon. It&#x27;s great. Leaves your skin soft without toxins/chemicals.</li>
    <li> oh my so good for the feet.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dry heels. I found that using the foot scraper is much more effective. However, this seems to help a bit and it really does smell good enough to taste (though I don&#x27;t recommend it).</li>
    <li> My foot likes it .. XD</li>
    <li> The tingle from the peppermint feels nice on your feet but, this didn&#x27;t keep my feet as moisturized as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Great smell, absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft.</li>
    <li> Applying peppermint foot lotion to my feet is practically a daily thing for me. Between seasonally dry feet &amp; being on my feet a lot during the day, this has become a part of my bedtime routine. I have tried many different brands of peppermint foot lotion over the years. This lotion is thick &amp; creamy and has a light peppermint scent. I really like that there are lots of natural ingredients in it and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. The lotion does do a decent job of soothing tired feet. I would say it&#x27;s better than a lot of the similar products out there. I personally like a stronger peppermint presence and one that leaves my feet tingling more than this one. However, for the price, I am pretty pleased. And because I go through so much peppermint foot lotion, I would definitely repurchase this one. Others in the same price range are not as good.</li>
    <li> Really good products all your products a really good</li>
    <li> I was using Gold Bond foot cream on some very dry cracked skin on both feet. It worked well and got things about 75% healed up but then I tried Tree Hut to see if it would do any better and the results were much better. Within a week I saw a noticeable improvement and am now almost 100% healed up with very little sign of any cracked, dry skin and only a small area of callous. My wife thought my feet were beyond repair and can&#x27;t believe the difference now. It has a cooling feel after application and has no greasy oily residue .</li>
    <li> I think I expected more but my feet just never got smooth using this product.  I prefer Curel Foot Therapy which I&#x27;ll be going back to using.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and how it feels on your feet.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this foot cream. I willmorder till it&#x27;s all gone. Lol great product.</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff every other month and love it.  The smell, the feel, the way it works - everything is great. I buy it along with the Tree Hut Exfoliating Foot Scrub, Peppermint and Sugar, 8-Ounce and the two make a great pair! I offer to let my friends try both out and they agree. I highly recommend this/these 2 products.</li>
    <li> A pretty decent deal for foot cream. I used body butter from tree hut before and I liked those too, so I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Spread easily, non-greasy, absorbs easily&lt;br /&gt;2. Has a pleasant smell (not very strong), kinda like mint chocolate chip ice cream, which is my bf&#x27;s favorite so I don&#x27;t mind;)&lt;br /&gt;3. Does not leave any traces and seems to moisturize my feet well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I haven&#x27;t found any so far. But if someone cares about this, most of the ingredients are not organic, except the shea butter. I also don&#x27;t think this one is cruelty free (i.e. no animal testing) unless the manufacturer just doesn&#x27;t advertise on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to my friends and will consider buying again.</li>
    <li> for years I suffered with cracked feet now after repeated use my feet are so soft.  I use it daily</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foot cream! It works great!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  The fragrance is wonderful, not overbearing at all as it pertains to the peppermint.  Do not forget to purchase the coordinating exfoliating foot scrub.  You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This foot cream is great,I recommend it highly !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but not quite as good as the diabetic lotion I normally use.  My friend told me this was great stuff, and I liked that it does have the peppermint in it, but while the Gold Bond Diabetic cream is a little better at softening.  I have peripheral neuropathy in my feet, and when I lie down at night, my feet hurt and burn.  The Gold Bond soothes them.  The pain and burning don&#x27;t completely go away, but it helps a lot, and works quickly.</li>
