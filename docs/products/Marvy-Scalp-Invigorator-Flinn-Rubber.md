      <li>Great shower brush.</li>
      <li>This feels great on my scalp, works up lots of lather, and saves my fingernails.  </li>
      <li>Great for getting the shampoo into the scalp.</li>
      <li>These feel great on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled and relieved that this quality product still exists!</li>
      <li>I would also think this would be great for anyone with arthritic fingers since you can palm this tool and still get a good massage.  </li>
      <li>The Marvy product is good.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have the finger nails to give your scalp and good</li>
      <li>and I loved to use it.</li>
      <li>Good scalp scratcher while shampooing hair.</li>
      <li>It has sniped off ends so the scalp does not get any kind of good scrub.</li>
      <li>This is like the kind my parents had 50 years ago</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re flexible and rubber and does not hurt the scalp at all like the plastic kind.</li>
      <li>The nubs on this are nice.  </li>
      <li>Especially right now when I have a headache.  </li>
      <li>This by far has been the greatest purchase I&#x27;ve made!</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and invigorating to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found one like it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>So much better than those plastic ones.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
      <li>I love this scalp invigorator.  </li>
      <li>It surely stimulates the scalp--and I&#x27;m bald.</li>
      <li>OMG I still love it, I refuse to go on vacation with out it.</li>
      <li>My barber recommended I use this to keep my scalp/ hair healthy, it&#x27;s done just that.</li>
      <li>I have one of these that I bought twenty years ago, and I love it.</li>
      <li>feel great because it gently massages your scalp.</li>
      <li>This hair scrubber is so much better than any</li>
      <li>I have been dandruff free for 2 years, even when I change my shampoos and conditioners, love, love, love</li>
      <li>I had one of these years ago, and the new one is still great.</li>
      <li>You can flex the brush outward for easy cleaning.  </li>
      <li>My Dad was a Barber and they used to make the best soft rubber ones that really gave a fantastic scalp massage.  </li>
      <li>This gets the job done quickly and thoroughly, which is more that can be said of my hands.</li>
      <li>Not as pliable and comfortable to use the ones from 50 years ago.</li>
      <li>Seems effective, though, and the classic design makes it easy to use.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t it be wonderful to once again have high quality merchandise that you could order year after year and always get the same quality?</li>
      <li>I use it to clean my hair after applying shampoo.  </li>
      <li>but it turns out I wasn&#x27;t getting it completely clean.</li>
      <li>I rub it now more gently</li>
      <li>Granted, this is still far better than the cheap plastic versions that are readily available, but</li>
      <li>A treat for the neglected scalp...fits easily into the hand and invigorates the nerve endings (not sure if that&#x27;s medically true, however it feels good.)</li>
      <li>This was not exactly as my old Fitch brand was but it is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not painful to really scrub</li>
      <li>The jury is out on the results of scalp massage, but if you&#x27;re the least bit interested, this is a good approach!</li>
      <li>Soft rubber molding that easily fits into the hand and use.  </li>
      <li>After it breaks in a little, I expect it to be good.</li>
      <li>After a lifetime of using the hard plastic ones, this is a great improvement.</li>
      <li>I actually get a better message from scrubbing with my fingers.</li>
      <li>My son who has short hair benefits from it the most.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted for a scalp invigorator.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a male shampoo brush with a male top, most of what I saw have a loop which I do not like, this was the main reason I ordered the one I did.</li>
      <li>Pretty straight forward.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice solid feeling thing but doesn&#x27;t work really well as far as my needs for a scalp scrubbing.</li>
      <li>Enjoyed using one while very young and eventually found this one on line that provides the same level of satisfaction.</li>
      <li>It certainly works way better than a comb and using it directly in the shower so what it loosens is then washed away, is key.</li>
      <li>thanks.  </li>
      <li>he really likes it and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
      <li>But I immediately noticed that it made my hair really frizzy.</li>
      <li>Best I could find that was all rubber instead of sharp hard plastic.  </li>
      <li>This is great but it does hurt a little because it was harder than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>if you have an older model and think you&#x27;ve found a carbon copy, ahmmm, no.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.  </li>
      <li>Great for scalp massage in the shower, not to hard, feels just right when adding a little shampoo or conditioner to your hair.</li>
      <li>purchased after a new stylist used it and said never to wash or allow others to wash my hair without using one.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what Flinn Rubber is, but it&#x27;s a little rougher on the scalp than the softer rubber ones that were available at one time.  </li>
      <li>Going back to hard plastic kind with lushious pointy ends to make my scalp tingle with blood flow.</li>
      <li>My Dad had one of these when I was young</li>
      <li>The rubber is flexible and the tips are rounded off enough to be gentle on the scalp, BUT...</li>
      <li>but if you have a sensitive scalp then it might hurt so</li>
      <li>I use this to help shampoo my hair with my all natural non lathering Morocco method shampoos.  </li>
      <li>So far, that hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
      <li>Giving your scalp a few passes with this brush leaves you feeling invigorated and possibly cleaner than those other unwashed heathens who don&#x27;t own this product.  </li>
      <li>The original rubber is firm enough to massage the scalp and the tips are rounded so you never feel like you &#x27;could&#x27;  damage your skin.</li>
      <li>I lost one similar and it was tough to find a suitable replacement.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair, and one of the problems with fine, curly hair is oil buildup on the scalp (since it&#x27;s harder for the oil to travel down curly strands).</li>
      <li>Its nubs are much squatter and softer than usual, so you can massage your scalp really vigorously while shampooing without doing any damage.</li>
      <li>Rubber bristles are to fat to do any deep or complete shampooing.  </li>
      <li>apparently our nails scratch our scalps making an opening for bacteria from under our nails and on our hands to invade our scalp and cause numerous irritations.</li>
      <li>I also got a plastic one (blue) that has thin &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; and I love them both for different reasons.</li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone with mobility issues, because it takes less time to get your hair really clean, and thus less time with your arms above your head.  </li>

    <li> I was expecting for this thing to work!! But all it does. Is scratch and irritate my scalp. So it s pointless and i cant use it for what it&#x27;s meant to.</li>
    <li> I looked for a long time for a shampoo brush that wasn&#x27;t plastic, and wasn&#x27;t designed for washing dogs.

    <li> The Marvy product is good.  I lost one similar and it was tough to find a suitable replacement. Soft rubber molding that easily fits into the hand and use.  Cleans well.  I use it to clean my hair after applying shampoo.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> my husband uses this for his brush.  he really likes it and that&#x27;s all that matters. thanks.  we&#x27;ve been trying to find a brush he likes</li>
    <li> I have one of these that I bought twenty years ago, and I love it. The original rubber is firm enough to massage the scalp and the tips are rounded so you never feel like you &#x27;could&#x27;  damage your skin. This one is &#x27;close&#x27;.... the name and model are identical, ditto for the color. The difference is the bristles are slightly firmer, not quite as soft and the tips are sharper. It makes a difference. Granted, this is still far better than the cheap plastic versions that are readily available, but if you have an older model and think you&#x27;ve found a carbon copy, ahmmm, no. How could this have happened you might ask? Well, it HAS been 20 years, and unfortunately the product is no longer produced in St. Paul, MN, but instead in......surprise.......China.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and invigorating to use. After a lifetime of using the hard plastic ones, this is a great improvement. It is rubber, medium-soft, it does not scratch your scalp at all. The jury is out on the results of scalp massage, but if you&#x27;re the least bit interested, this is a good approach!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.  When shampooing hair with this shampoo brush, the addition of water/shampoo makes this product hard to hold onto.  Rubber bristles are to fat to do any deep or complete shampooing.  Will be ordering a replacement from a different vendor.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted for a scalp invigorator.  I also got a plastic one (blue) that has thin &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; and I love them both for different reasons. Feels great!</li>
    <li> A treat for the neglected scalp...fits easily into the hand and invigorates the nerve endings (not sure if that&#x27;s medically true, however it feels good.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush, made of rubber, that you use in the shower to scrub your scalp.  Pretty straight forward.  It&#x27;s flexible and conforms to the contours of my slightly misshapen skull.  The &#x27;nubbies&#x27; are firm but not sharp.  It&#x27;s not painful to really scrub and there&#x27;s no real danger of scrubbing so hard you draw blood.  I suppose you could draw blood, but that would take some extreme effort.  You can flex the brush outward for easy cleaning.  Giving your scalp a few passes with this brush leaves you feeling invigorated and possibly cleaner than those other unwashed heathens who don&#x27;t own this product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great shower brush. Helps get the shampoo down into the scalp. My son who has short hair benefits from it the most. Helped him get rid of his dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Not as pliable and comfortable to use the ones from 50 years ago.</li>
    <li> I thought I was washing my hair before but it turns out I wasn&#x27;t getting it completely clean. I have curly hair, and one of the problems with fine, curly hair is oil buildup on the scalp (since it&#x27;s harder for the oil to travel down curly strands). This brush is like a scalp massage, detangler, and shampoo distributor rolled into one. It&#x27;s perfect. I will never be without one again.</li>
    <li> So much better than those plastic ones. This is like the kind my parents had 50 years ago</li>
    <li> The prongs are just to thick for my preference.</li>
    <li> My Dad had one of these when I was young and I loved to use it. I&#x27;m glad I found one like it.</li>
    <li> I love this scalp invigorator.  I use this to help shampoo my hair with my all natural non lathering Morocco method shampoos.  It feels like a little head massage every time I shower.</li>
    <li> Another thing to not cure my dandruff, but with some vigorous scrubbing I can usually remove enough flaking so that it&#x27;s less noticeable on a daily basis. It certainly works way better than a comb and using it directly in the shower so what it loosens is then washed away, is key.</li>
    <li> Moving the invigorator over the scalp masseges the skin. Enjoyed using one while very young and eventually found this one on line that provides the same level of satisfaction.</li>
    <li> its to hard and hurts your head</li>
    <li> Item arrived in 3 days. Mother was a Beautician for 0ver 50 years and had one just like this. It is a little pointy but that will change in time. It surely stimulates the scalp--and I&#x27;m bald.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a little softer, plus not have sharp edges where the tips are all flat.  If they would have made those rounded, they wouldn&#x27;t need to make it softer.</li>
    <li> Great for getting the shampoo into the scalp.</li>
    <li> This is great but it does hurt a little because it was harder than I thought it would be. I rub it now more gently but if you have a sensitive scalp then it might hurt so be careful. Otherwise great way to get some circulation going!</li>
    <li> purchased after a new stylist used it and said never to wash or allow others to wash my hair without using one. apparently our nails scratch our scalps making an opening for bacteria from under our nails and on our hands to invade our scalp and cause numerous irritations. makes sense when you think about it because i have never cleaned under my nails before washing my hair unless there was something visible underneath. a little awkward to hold because of the handle but i use at every wash. feel great because it gently massages your scalp. would purchase again.</li>
    <li> My barber recommended I use this to keep my scalp/ hair healthy, it&#x27;s done just that.</li>
    <li> I was struggling with dry scalp, my Aunt is a dermatologist and I tried a ton of different crazy things to stop it. This by far has been the greatest purchase I&#x27;ve made! It actually prevents flaking for me! I love it!!!  Follow up 11/21/16- OMG I still love it, I refuse to go on vacation with out it. I have been dandruff free for 2 years, even when I change my shampoos and conditioners, love, love, love</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago, and the new one is still great. If you don&#x27;t have the finger nails to give your scalp and good going over, then this will help.</li>
    <li> The last one of these I had, (another brand) had rounded tips on all the little knobs. These are flat on the bottom of each one, which makes them sharp on the edge of each one, and it feels like I am scraping my scalp off. I have used it several times, thinking I will eventually get use to it. So far, that hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
    <li> Good scalp scratcher while shampooing hair. Solid rubber.</li>
    <li> I use this on a daily basis. It helps with my dandruff and itchy scalp. It also seems like it has made my hair softer as well. The rubber bristles are quite stiff, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to start being painful.</li>
    <li> Rubber is very hard, hurts my head to use it when I wash my hair.  I wanted a male shampoo brush with a male top, most of what I saw have a loop which I do not like, this was the main reason I ordered the one I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a dry scalp fighting with dandruff for years.  Hands down, this was the only thing that helped!  Amazing!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be the solution to my dry hair problems. But I immediately noticed that it made my hair really frizzy. I don&#x27;t know how, but it seemed to be damaging my hair. Back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> This hair scrubber is so much better than any I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Its nubs are much squatter and softer than usual, so you can massage your scalp really vigorously while shampooing without doing any damage.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these (the same one) for over 40 years!  Left it overseas so I was thrilled and relieved that this quality product still exists!</li>
    <li> I  am currently have a flair up of seborriic dermatitis (Cradle Cap for grown ups) and was doing damage to my scalp with my fingernails.  This Marvy Scalp invigorator is wonderful.  Very good even with my shoulder length hair!  I would also think this would be great for anyone with arthritic fingers since you can palm this tool and still get a good massage.  Hoping this will help do the trick!</li>
    <li> Great for scalp massage in the shower, not to hard, feels just right when adding a little shampoo or conditioner to your hair.</li>
    <li> The nubs on this are nice.  The rubber is flexible and the tips are rounded off enough to be gentle on the scalp, BUT... my hair is so thick it only penetrates to my scalp on the edges of my hairline.  At the crown of my head, where the hair is longest and thickest, it just doesn&#x27;t get through.  The nubs are too short.  Bummer.  Maybe if I were to get a buzz cut it would work, but as it is,... nope.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a scalp scrubber before but felt like I needed something stronger than my fingers to work shampoo into my thick curly hair and to remove dead skin. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. It works just like I thought it would, my hair is cleaner, and I have less dandruff after one use. Even my boyfriend uses it and enjoys the massaging feeling.</li>
    <li> The Marvy scalp invigorator made of flinn rubber - The rubber is harder than the one I now have and not quite as flexible.</li>
    <li> Best I could find that was all rubber instead of sharp hard plastic.  My Dad was a Barber and they used to make the best soft rubber ones that really gave a fantastic scalp massage.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be wonderful to once again have high quality merchandise that you could order year after year and always get the same quality?</li>
    <li> It was a little harder and sharper than I expected. After it breaks in a little, I expect it to be good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what Flinn Rubber is, but it&#x27;s a little rougher on the scalp than the softer rubber ones that were available at one time.  Seems effective, though, and the classic design makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> Much too hard. Could not use it. It hurts.</li>
    <li> Cleans without tearing up your scalp.</li>
    <li> It has sniped off ends so the scalp does not get any kind of good scrub. The rubber sticks to my hair. Can&#x27;t comb through scalp. Going back to hard plastic kind with lushious pointy ends to make my scalp tingle with blood flow. This is a nice solid feeling thing but doesn&#x27;t work really well as far as my needs for a scalp scrubbing.</li>
    <li> These feel great on my scalp.  Just thinking about them makes me want to go grab them and rub them all over.  Especially right now when I have a headache.  I highly recommend these.  They&#x27;re flexible and rubber and does not hurt the scalp at all like the plastic kind.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  I thought the prongs would be longer.  I actually get a better message from scrubbing with my fingers.</li>
    <li> This was not exactly as my old Fitch brand was but it is pretty good.  The rubber bristles are shorter.</li>
