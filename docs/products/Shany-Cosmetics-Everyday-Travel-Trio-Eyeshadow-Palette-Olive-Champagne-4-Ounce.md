    <li> Yes, they are beautiful colors. Yes, they are huge pans and a bargain price. But nowhere on the packaging does it say where these shadows are made. On the Shany website it only says they are made in their own factory. I e-mailed them 10 days ago and have yet to receive a reply. Because of the price and lack of origination info either on package or website I can only assume they are manufactured in China.</li>
    <li> This palette is so handy for many different looks, Smokey-eyes, and bright makeup. Great for multi-purpose use and any look you desire!</li>
