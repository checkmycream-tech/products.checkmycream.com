<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i only used this a couple times. bad quality. does not stay put. colors end up all over my eye lid :-(</li>
    <li> I had the Naked 2 palette but wanted something with more options and brighter colors - this is perfect. Colors are well pigmented and gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous about buying this palette at first because I have been trying to find a good affordable eye shadow set and I have to say I am very pleased so far with this product. The colors are very pigmented and show very well on my medium brown skin. I am still playing with the different colors but colors I have tried with other products are showing up on my eyes so much better. I like the fact this product prevents breakouts and does not irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> This just arrived. The packaging was nice, No broken shadows, the delivery time was great but the product when I saw it was a little MEH.&lt;br /&gt;The natural colors are no where near as varietal as shown in the picture. So for that in particular I had to give 2 stars because I don&#x27;t like it. I will update the review once I get over the disappointment if the eyeshadow is anything to write home about.</li>
    <li> I am sure I would have LOVED this but it was damaged.  BOTH palettes had pulverized shadows and there was residue everywhere.  I was so looking forward to receiving this as the colors are fabulous, pigmented and truly gorgeous but I am very disappointed by the damage.  I feel I should be shipped another palette, free of charge and overnight so I can enjoy this as I had planned.  I would be happy to return the original, if a return label is included in the new shipment.  Otherwise, it probably isn&#x27;t worth waiting for.  I have never had an issue with anything I have purchased from Amazon until now.   I wish I could have given this 5 stars...but, it is what it is.  Very disappointed.....  :(  :(</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors! This palette is incredible, will last you a long time! I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It came super fast! Cute packing &amp; the colors are true to picture. In love !</li>
    <li> So many colors not a whole lot of blue options but you really shouldn&#x27;t wear blue anyhow because it does not reflect off light very well, but there are so many fun and natural colors. It&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> I love this pallet of eye shadow! I use it every day! There is a color for every outfit and every look. There are some colors on the top pallet that are so light they need to a couple of coats to let them be seen, but other than that  this is the best eye shadow I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! I have caramel skin and these colors show up beautifully on my eyes. I haven&#x27;t had to do ANY touch-ups throughout the day. I put it on, it&#x27;s there until I wipe it off. And since there are so many colors I threw away all my old single eyeshadows. Everything I need as far as eyeshadows is in this palette. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product Only thing I did like was that some are the colors aren&#x27;t as bold as I would like</li>
    <li> These colors are pretty pigmented, they can definitely be built up for maximum density and brightness.&lt;br /&gt;For the price and the amount of eyeshadows this is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the quality of the eyeshadows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS - They leave a little fall out be sure to tap your brush to remove excess&lt;br /&gt;  - The neon colors are a bit chalky and not as opaque as i wanted but nonetheless good colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS - the neutral colors are very pigmented&lt;br /&gt;  - all colors blend very well and are easy to use&lt;br /&gt;  - SUCH a variety of color I LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;  - great for beginners or more advanced in the make-up fields&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the end this is a  great product, the only downfall is that its just a tiny bit chalky but its really not that much of a big deal, i would definitely recommend. Just expect some chalkiness and not much pigmentation when it comes to the brighter colors.</li>
    <li> I love using this product, especially for those natural or dramatic looks. I am using this product for my Senior Portraits at high school and I have tried several looks and colors and they all look amazing! I expected it to be a little bigger, but it was still worth it. The pigments work great on the eyelids, just remember to use eye shadow primer! I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks and I feel like I already over use it. They really met my expectations, I even started using it on close friends and family members to test things out on different eye shapes. The shipping was very quick, about 2 days at the most. I recommend!</li>
    <li> The delivery was very prompt; I ordered this item just a few days ago, and I&#x27;ve already received it. One of the quickest delivery times I think I&#x27;ve ever experienced (which is ironic, because the seller description stated that the item usually ships in 3 to 5 weeks).  The colors are amazing. Vibrant, but not outrageous. Highly pigmented. I would describe these colors as &#x27;bright,&#x27; compared to &#x27;neon.&#x27; The texture of the shadows are wonderful; a satiny finish to them. Some have little specks of glitter (mainly a couple of really dark colors), and the varying shades of a given hue are amazing. I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but I have a feeling this is going to end up being my new favorite palette (and I own MAC, bh, Coastal Scents, etc.).  The shadows themselves are quite small, which a few other reviewers mentioned, I believe, but because the shadows are highly pigmented, I can&#x27;t imagine that you&#x27;d need to use all that much shadow, unless you&#x27;re trying to go for a really bold, outrageous look.  This palette was a bit more expensive than some of the other ones you can buy for the same type of product (minus MAC), but it could have just been the particular palette I found. Either way, if you&#x27;re a gal that loves the earthy/natural tones, this is the palette for you! I try to play up brunette undertones, and this palette gives me enough colors to chose from to stay in my color scheme, but still offers me some brighter, playful colors on days when I&#x27;m feeling adventurous. I have a lot of &#x27;warm&#x27; palettes, but most warm/neutral palettes don&#x27;t give you mauves, burgandy&#x27;s, warm colors from the red/pink/purple scale. This one does; great addition to any warm/neutral palette! (And those colors are supposed to play up brown eyes! Perfect!)  One con though: a few of the shadows were chipped upon arrival. I&#x27;m not sure if this was a packaging issue, or US Postal Service issue, but a few other palettes I&#x27;ve received were marked as &#x27;fragile&#x27; which I think helped to keep the shadows from breaking apart (lack of being tossed). I think it would have helped if the box had a &#x27;fragile&#x27; sign on it, but I&#x27;m sure most makeup sellers don&#x27;t consider that, and like I said, I&#x27;m not sure where the damage happened, so I can&#x27;t definitely put the blame on one place.  Anyway, don&#x27;t hesitate any longer - buy this product! I waited almost a month and half just debating, and I wish I&#x27;d caved sooner!</li>
    <li> EL productos llegó en excelente condiciones, colores hermosos, de muy buena calidad. Super satisfecha por mi compra. Lo recomiendo :-)</li>
    <li> The blacks on the bottom were broken but the rest are perfect</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow is exactly what I expected. I really like it, blending it is a bit hard but other than that I really like it. BUT! When I received my eyeshadow 3 of the eyeshadows were busted and smeared into all of the other colors. I am not happy about this at all! If I order something I expect it to get here looking like it did when it left. That was not the case.</li>
    <li> This is a really good quality eyeshadow pallett I love the wise variety of colors that is gives. Also the color stays on and last all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;ve never been one to wear much makeup, but recently I&#x27;ve decided I want to start learning more. Rather than go out and buy lots of colors in separate little palettes I don&#x27;t know will work for me, I decided to buy a large palette with a wide assortment of colors so I can experiment and learn what colors look good on me. So far I&#x27;ve been very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m a novice, I won&#x27;t comment on the quality of the makeup. I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s great or not, but I really like it. Some colors seem quite pigmented while some seem to go on lighter than expected. I&#x27;m cool with that, personally. I just swipe my finger across the top of the color to test it out first. I really like that this package contains some really brilliant colors and a neutral palette as well. The neutrals scare me less. Haha! I&#x27;m branching out though and trying colors I wouldn&#x27;t have bought in a smaller palette and finding I really like them. For that reason, I really recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about eye shadow colors without a huge cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and 120 colors for $15 is a bargain! I went to the drugstore and bought a 3 color palette of Wet and Wild eye shadow for about $3. That&#x27;s $1 per color for the Wet and Wild. This pack works out to $0.125 per color. Yes, I got more product per color of the cheap-o Wet and Wild, but it&#x27;s still plenty when you look at the fact that you&#x27;re getting so many colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint (and the reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5) is that when the package arrived one of my colors was shattered. I considered sending it back for a replacement, but didn&#x27;t think it was worth the effort for one color. Not to mention I was too eager to try out the colors to want to wait for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this palette, especially if you&#x27;re just learning about makeup. It&#x27;s a lot of fun to play with the bright flashy colors, but you still have the neutral palette to learn with too.</li>
    <li> The colors have great pigment, not really any fall out..and they blend great.. Would recommend Shany products, a great price for great quality product..</li>
    <li> None of the colors broke during shipping which was a definite plus for me! And the colors are really vibrant! I love it</li>
    <li> Received today!&lt;br /&gt;Wrapped up well, until I saw black everywhere ):&lt;br /&gt;Was a little bummed when I found that the matte black was broken ): and that it was all over the case.&lt;br /&gt;Love the look of this compact can&#x27;t wait to start using it.  But this girl just cleaned it up, and thankful for her way around alcohol (: Will definitely buy again. Unfortunately had to give 4 stars because 1 was broken...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this palette and the colors. I would buy another palette again very soon.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow shipped quickly the colors are so pretty and they are well pigmented good product for a good price</li>
    <li> This is an amazing palette , love all the colors (:</li>
    <li> My item came in perfectly. Wrapped in double bubble wrap and wrapped again inside the box. Nothing was broken and everything in place. The eyeshadows were wonderful and stood in place wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Great selection of colors and color pigmentation, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy with the colors, not as bright as the pictures displayed.</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail yesterday. It&#x27;s a small item. Sits about an inch lower than the Sephora collection if you were to stand the two side by side. It is longer width wise though. Lovely. Highly pigmented colors. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;ve swatched it. Small enough to carry in a medium sized purse. Came bubble wrapped inside the box and outside the box!! Reached me in perfect condition! I&#x27;m so excited to use it. It has a lot of colors you don&#x27;t find regularly in your seasonal collections, altogether in one case! I&#x27;ll review again after I use it.</li>
    <li> Amazing eyeshadow pallets but there is less than 1 gram of each shadow</li>
    <li> The yellows and pigmented colors are not as sharp as I would have liked.  I had to pack on the yellow just to see it on my lid.  The less pigmented colors like the palette with the beige, browns, and black in it seems true to color.  The brighter palette is hit and miss.  I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times now, and I&#x27;m still experimenting, but my initial reaction was a little disappointing.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of that reason, however I&#x27;m still excited about the possibilities.</li>
    <li> I really love my Shany Eyeshadow Palette. It has like every color you&#x27;d ever need and the opacity is good as well :) I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it ;)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing palette, with such variety. If you have neutral days, there is a half for all those colors, if you need a pop of color, it has that too. So soft, and rich. The price is fantastic, and shipping is quick. :)    Check out my video review!    [...]</li>
    <li> THIS PALETTE IS OUTSTANDING!! ITS GREAT FOR LADIES WHO LOVE TO ROCK THEIR COLORED EYESHADOWS AND ITS ALSO GREAT FOR THOSE NATURAL BEAUTIES!! YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF BOTH!! THIS PALETTE IS SO PIGMENTED AND RICH IN COLOR ITS CRAZY!! SHANY COSMETICS NEVER DISAPPOINTS!! TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> I just got this eyeshadow pallet today and I must admit, I&#x27;m happier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are highly pigmented and come in a great variety. I&#x27;m addicted to eyeshadows so this is a perfect collection. I can&#x27;t wait to see all the color combinations.&lt;br /&gt;Not one was broken in shipping.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet so thats why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars BUT I just now got it in the mail and there were no broken pieces at all :) and I&#x27;m very excited to try it.  I will probably update this review later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: When used with primer that colors are absolutely fantastic!</li>
    <li> So, I love this palette.  Its very pigmented. Lots of beautiful colors that POP!!! Im never disappointed by Shany eyeshadow products. I hope they come out with a new palette soon. Excited!!!!</li>
    <li> I received my Shany eyeshadow palette this morning. It was wrapped real tight, but I was a little hurt that one of my pink eyeshadow was cracked, and spilled all over the place, but with a little tissue I was able to cleaned it right up, and one of my brown shadow came loose. Over all the colors are popping I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> You have to pack on alot of color for it to really show up and that&#x27;s even with me using an eyeshadow primer. Also, once applied the colors fade easy too.</li>
    <li> The shadows are so pretty and the variations give you so many options. I searched through a lot of palettes and watched numerous YouTube videos before deciding to go with SHANY. The quality of the colors + the price couldn&#x27;t be beat. A  few videos I watched mentioned that some of the colors may be broken when they arrive and to send them back if that happens. When mine arrived, 3 of the shadows were broken. I took pictures, but decided it wasn&#x27;t a big enough deal to send the entire case back. The colors are still useable, I just have to be careful when closing the case after I finish using it. Great buy though!</li>
    <li> I love the amazing colors. It easily blends and it doesn&#x27;t fade away. I am not use to waering or using bright colors, but this palette helps me along the way. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love make up, especially eye make up- I&#x27;ve worked in beauty salons, cosmetic stores and even been told by make up professionals that I should consider doing it professionally. So I am by no means a make-up rookie, I was super concerned when I purchased this palette- I was worried the colors wouldn&#x27;t be vibrant, that it would come off after a few hours, that the colors were too small- I had never heard of this brand and have been programmed to believe for it to be good high quality make up, generally you have to pay a pretty penny for it. Well I can say I was pleasantly surprised when I first used this palette. The colors are as vibrant in the picture- not only on the palette, but on my eyes as well and if there&#x27;s a color you want to be even more vibrant then just use the colors wet. It lasts all day and stays bright all day as well! I do smokey eyes everyday, I just switch up the colors- so far I&#x27;ve done purple, yellow, gold/brown with this palette and I&#x27;ve loved all of them and gotten so many compliments! I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I decided to try this and I&#x27;m glad I did. Colors are very vibrant and looks aren&#x27;t deceiving. A few of them could stand to be a little softer in formula, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. When it came in the mail though, the black was all crumbled and that is still a pain to clean and try to not get on your hands. Can&#x27;t help but think there are still better ways to package but I don&#x27;t know XD That&#x27;s nothing against the actual product itself though.</li>
    <li> They are a very good product I gave them to my daughter and she love them and like them very much</li>
    <li> Great colors, however you need premier underneath color shadows. But if you the premier I would give it four stars</li>
    <li> First time owning an eye shadow palette and the colors were very beautiful.  The packaging was really really great. You can tell they really want you to receive it in good shape. It almost did. There was only 1 eyeshadow that came loose but still in its place. I must say if you are looking for colors that shows really well without putting on so much this palette or brand does its stuff. I didn&#x27;t realize how high the pigments are. I would only use it to go out and use the natural color for every day wear. It is a good buy.</li>
    <li> great pigmentation of eyeshadows, nice range of colours, certainly good value for money, highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is my go to makeup pallet for eyeshadow. There are so many colors to choose from I never run out of new looks. The shadows go on smoothly and evenly without creasing. Finishes to a creamy, soft powder. The glimmer shadows have just the right amount of reflection without looking over the top.The matte and neons colors have a great amount of pigmentation and look exactly the same on the face as they do on the pallet. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It arrived in the mail today, I was very excited to gey it today because of the pretty colors. However most of the eyeshadows was broken and dented in  . It really sucks since the colors are very beautiful ans looks like the picture. Oh well I might reorder from Amazon or from the orginal website.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters Christmas gift and she loves it, shipped fast no issues wonderful product, colors are great and last long.. I even dipped into it myself &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> just what I wanted! Arrived in pristine condition.  TONS of colors, both  matte and shimmer! I love having everything right there in the same palette.  I look at all the colors and just play around.</li>
    <li> While looking at this pallet the colors looked so nice! I was so excited when my package came in the mail. However.....It was horrible, the colors were mostly matte I thought shimmer would be more prominent, the colors were cracked, and I am not talking about one or two I&#x27;m talking between six and seven. I was so disappointed. But I still remained hopeful since the colors that came cracked I personally didn&#x27;t use that much, I decided to try it. Even with a primer these colors lack in the pigment department. I ordered a set from BH cosmetics, and even Coastal Scents. Those are waaaaaayyyy more reliable, longer lasting, and HIGHLY pigmented than these.</li>
    <li> This is insane, love love love this!! I would soooo buy this again in a heartbeat !! Beautiful colors! I will be buying shany makeup again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She said she loves the colors.</li>
    <li> i have quite sensitive skin but this caused no rash! This was my first purchase for eye shadow online and i was not disappointed, and due too compliments on my eye shadow i highly recommend this product too people, friends and family! It&#x27;s a must buy!!</li>
    <li> I decided to try it for the first time, youtube gave me some great reviews and tips plus great ideas.  I dyed my hair from blonde to brunette and it was nice to not have to go out and buy all new makeup!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for its wide variety of colors, and I must say, for about $28 (that includes shipping) it was very very worth it! It came in a cute little box, and the ribbons on the side are very useful. Some colors are shimmery, some are matte. Definitely recommend this to any person who is getting into makeup!!</li>
    <li> This is my second shany cosmetics eyeshadow palette purchase. After the first one I was hooked! I combine shany eyeshadow with a white eyeshadow primer and I swear to god...you get the same effect as using MAC eyeshadow as a fraction of the cost. These eyeshadows are extremely high quality and cruelty free.  I&#x27;ve stopped using other eyeshadows and I only use shany eyeshadow now:)</li>
    <li> It would be nice if it had a few more matte colors, but otherwise it&#x27;s a great collection. I love the colors and the quality. I use it on Urban Decay eye shadow primer and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Two colors were slightly damaged, probably from shipping. It was only wrapped in one layer really small/thin bubble wrap and other things were in the box so Amazon should protect it better.</li>
    <li> For me, a beginner, the pigmentation is just right in this wide array of colors.  I should use primer to make the colors last throughout the day.  But on initial application and for hours thereafter, the degree of pigmentation is marvelous.  Love that I get such an array in such a compact case.  Very slim and secure packaging, which I love.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a year and a half ago, and when used with a eyeshadow primer, the results were amazing! The top palette has 60 bright colors in shades of both light and dark reds, oranges, golden (I would have called them yellow, but they have move golden hues then yellow), greens, blues and violets. The hidden bottom palette contains 60 different neutral colors, ranging from whites, greys, black, creams, mauves, and browns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this item that first time, I used mainly the bright colors with minimal shading from the neutrals. They came in very handy with smoky eye looks. However, when we moved a number of my cosmetics were ruined, this being among them. When I finally found another one on here, I was so enthused that I ordered another one that same day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A point that I should advise you of in spite of my enjoyment of the product: CHECK YOUR SHIPPING DATES! In my own foolish haste, I ordered this item from a different seller than the previous purchase and was shocked when I realized that the one thing holding all my other purchases up was this! Upon contacting Amazon, I found that I had ordered one that had a shipping date between then (September), and the beginning of December! However, they were very kind and had all the other items that I ordered shipped to me. Thank you, Amazon support techs! I also received the shadow set before I even knew it had shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in closing, if you are looking for a eyeshadow that can be used for both casual and glamorous, this could be the one for you. Also, it might interest some potential purchasers out there to know that this product is not tested upon animals. For those of you who purchase this, enjoy!</li>
    <li> Tons of colors but it doesn&#x27;t last long without primer or foundation underneath it</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeshadow. The colors are radiant and stay on well, there&#x27;s a huge selection but with and without shimmer though the pieces are small they&#x27;re big enough that it will last you a while.</li>
    <li> I must say that Shany Cosmetics has set the bar for themselves. This makeup is very bright and vibrant. I do not regret buying it! (:</li>
    <li> I love love the colors in the pallets. It is a good product. so I will recommend it to otthers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say i didn&#x27;t like this shany eye shadow palette. The colors are not pigmented, they&#x27;re chalky insted :( . I gave this palette a chance three times , but for me was only a waste of money! very disappointed with this purchase :( . I will not recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great colours, great pigment, great coverage.  I do wish it had some better packaging/casing because if you&#x27;re in a hurry you can accidentally drop the palette and break all your colours.  If it had a way to secure the palette plates a little more tightly it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> When I decided to order this eyeshadow pallette I was very excited. I had ordered from shany before and was very satisfied. After receiving this in the mail I was very happy because it was early! The eyeshadows are amazing and pigmented too! Love it :)</li>
    <li> I have no regrets buying the eye shadow palette! The pigments are beautiful the color won&#x27;t wear out when you apply and its great quality!! This is worth spending money on. LOVE IT!! Overall great purchase!</li>
    <li> All of the colors are just so vibrant and beautiful! Packaged very well,  the box was wrapped in stirafoam as well as INSIDE the box to keep from any ruff handling. no crumbling, nothing! No complaints, no worries, no concerns. Very pleased customer :)</li>
    <li> The colors are absolutely beautiful and bright! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, I tried some colors already and loved the outcome. The only issue is that primer is definitely needed. I&#x27;ve bought cheaper products and had no problem applying it onto my eyelid without the primer but with this product the color just doesn&#x27;t stay on or it&#x27;s not as nice as it should be without primer. Bottom line, colors are beautiful, you have many choices and a wide variety of colors. Definitely worth the 20 bucks spent!</li>
    <li> Lots of really great colors in this set. You must use a base of some sort or the color will not work well. Downsides: some colors are quite different from what they look like to when they are worn. You definitely should practice with them before committing to a color for a special event.</li>
    <li> product is great love the colors</li>
    <li> love love love this eyeshadow the colors are super bright and beautiful, easy to apply and it doesnt run it stays in place all night long. this was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> There are plenty of colors to choose from! Sometimes it gets overwhelming, but it&#x27;s great quality, also. Very well priced. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I really love this palette. I read some reviews that said the colors weren&#x27;t very pigmented, but after using it I would have to disagree. I really love the color selection. Perfect for blending eyeshadows out for a color gradient effect. The black color is amazing, I have yet to find a black color this pigmented. I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a large box with tons of bubble wrap to prevent the colors from shattering. That was one of my biggest worries, is that some of the colors would be broken, but they were all perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying Shany products again, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love the color selection! Must have for make up lovers! And for the price you cant beat that! Quality at an affordable price</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing. They are bold and blendable, just everything I&#x27;d hoped they would be. And, if you consider how many colors you get, it&#x27;s really a hell of a deal. It&#x27;s $6 just for four colors from Cover Girl and they aren&#x27;t anywhere near as bold. The only thing that kept me from giving a five star rating is that one of the eyeshadows was broken.. The black broke during shipping(I&#x27;m assuming) and it was just everywhere; it was on the case, causing me to get black all over everything before I noticed, and in a lot of the other colors. It kind of sucks that the black was messed up, because it&#x27;s one of my favorite colors. Otherwise, this is a great product. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Super theyre super pigmented without a base!! And even more pigmented with a nyx jumbo pencil in milk!! I am in love as a makeup artist I am trying to expand my kit and of course use multiple brands. My favorite thing about this palette is that it has neutrals and an array of colors And they aren&#x27;t chalky at all they go on very smooth. I also love that it comes with ribbons on the sides so that it isn&#x27;t too complicated to take each tray out. This brand does have an instagram @shanycosmetics which I love I&#x27;ll definitely be doing a review for them soon on my makeup page follow me&lt;br /&gt;Instagram @makeupbychuchii</li>
    <li> Good makeup kit. My girlfriend loves this product. She says it&#x27;s a quality eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Only 4 stars since the only color that was damaged was black which got all over the place :(</li>
    <li> I really loved! It&#x27;s like what I expected! Amei todas as cores!</li>
    <li> This is simply not the same formula as the natural fusion version.. although the colors are vast and pretty and have blues and pinks (the natural fusion does not) they are slightly bigger rounded offerings and the texture is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still use them later, after I run out of the first palette I owned. That one is the bomb!I have never seen so many colors that I simply thought were a waste and turned out to be excellent highlights and lowlights. Very thoughtful person who put together the natural palette. I wonder who did?</li>
    <li> I must be honest. I saw this product while watching Coloured Beautiful on YouTube. The colors are awesome. The colors are long lasting and they really look great on darker complexions. I give this collection 5 stars based on the quality and quantity. I registered on the Shany website and look forward to experimenting with colors that I would not have used prior. Great buy.... I recommend that you get this product and pair it with some great heels and bags from Just Fab. Superstar Status!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! the colors blend soo easily and that&#x27;s coming from me and im not that good of a blender! but i swear with how matt it is anybody can use it and look beautiful!</li>
    <li> These colors are so great! All colors are very pigmented and go on light or dark according to how heavy a hand you use when applying. I&#x27;ve used many as liners and that works well. For me, this kit had all the colors I need and want in eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I choose four stars because two of the shadows came a little bit shattered, i was&lt;br /&gt;dissapointed but not worried because it was only two, maybe next time theyll be a little&lt;br /&gt;careful. Over all i was happy this was a good selection for the price. I would recomend it!</li>
    <li> Great range of colors and pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I am so very impressed with this palette. It came packaged with utmost care (two thick layers of bubble wrap) and intact. Each layer had it&#x27;s own protective film over it, and a pink ribbon to make it easy to take the palettes out. The shadows have a fine, almost silky texture and are richly pigmented. I can apply it in the morning and it sticks around until late in the evening. I occasionally have problems with creasing after about 8 hours or so, but I typically use no primer, so it&#x27;s to be expected. I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist by any means, but I like playing around with colors to suit different occasions/ events, and I&#x27;m confident THIS palette is all I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> i like the shades of the colors, but the shadows dont stay too long, besides that the price was affordable and nice to my pocket</li>
    <li> I usually use Mac, but Mac can get expensive and I wanted to buy an eyeshadow palette for a good price. I came across this, however I was hesitant about buying this at first, especially with me being black because I was worried that it would not show up on me. After doing plenty of research I ended up buying this along with the bright and bold eyeshadow palette and I absolutely love it! The palette is very pigmented so it definitely shows up on darker skin tones. I have had no irritations or anything like that and the colors last throughout the day. The price is unbeatable and I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best thing ever but it&#x27;s worth a prize ... they&#x27;re really pigmented  and if you use a really good concealer theyll come out exactly how they look on the palate.</li>
    <li> I love this palette - such a great investment!! The amount of looks which can be created with this palette is endless!! From the everyday look to the dramatic look (and all the looks in between); the shadows are not chalky and the quality is pretty good. I use a eyeshadow primer or concealer before applying and the &amp;#34;staying-power&amp;#34; is pretty descent. I really can&#x27;t say anything negative about this palette - I&#x27;ve had this for some months now, but I recall that the shipping is good and the shadows all came in tact!!! Great buy makeup lovers.....</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS! Its such a good product, I read some reviews that made me not want to buy this palette but i don&#x27;t regret it at all. The colors are exactly as shown and mine weren&#x27;t broken. In fact it was so protected with bubble wrap, great service. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a lot of colors. each one is about the size of a penny though, so i don&#x27;t know if that will be a downside for anyone.</li>
    <li> And, I read in previous reviews that some of the colors cracked/shattered during shipment. My palette arrived double wrapped in bubble pack. Lots of fun to do new color combos!</li>
    <li> i love it. it is wonderfull. it is my favorite. i use it every day. it is excelllent. i recommend it</li>
    <li> Well worth the wait! This is the best makeup. Gorgeous colors, great texture and quality. There are colors for every skin tone.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful palette! I love the colors and it&#x27;s easy to use. A great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> The pigment in this shadow is amazing! Definitely would recommend this product. Can make any look with it and has a wide variety of colors. This is a must buy!</li>
    <li> Item as described ,down fall four of the eyeshadows came broken beyond repair. Very pigmented and you can use them wet or dry and they&#x27;re very good with blending.</li>
    <li> Overall this is nice for someone like me who wants to experiment with makeup and is getting into learning how to do different looks. Some colors are more pigmented than others as with any palette whether high-end or drugstore. But I truly enjoy the neutral palette mostly for everyday looks and a sort of naked palette dupe. And some lighter colors turn out better with an eyeshadow base.</li>
    <li> The colors are really nice and pigmented and the fact that they have such a wide assortment of colors to choose from is a major plus. I&#x27;m slowly falling in love with this brand :)</li>
    <li> I WAS SCEPTICAL THAT THE COLOURS MIGHT BE TOO SUBDUED. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE AND JUSTIFIES THE DIME SIZE AMOUNTS PROVIDED. ALSO, THE SELECTION OF COLOURS IS FABULOUS. A WIDE ARRAY TO MATCH ANY EYE COLOUR OR MOOD. WHEN PURCHASING OTHER PALLETTES, I WOULD USE ABOUT 40% OF THE COLOURS AND THE REST GO TO WASTE. I PURCHASED ONE FOR EACH OF MY 3 DAUGHTERS WHO HAVE HAZEL, BLUE AND GREEN EYES RESPECTIVELY. THEY REALLY CHUFFED!!</li>
    <li> These are ok they could of been a bit more pigmented but they are pretty ok. There is really nothing negative to say.</li>
    <li> It is a great versatile palette but the colors are not as pigmented for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this because a girl I work with spoke highly of it so I wanted it. I got it in the mail with one color broke all over the palatte. I cleaned that up no big deal but when I went to use it it didn&#x27;t go on my eyes at all. Nothing like what it should do. I put layer after layer on and didn&#x27;t even look like it should. I wet my brush and used it that way and the same thing happened. I will be throwing this palette away and buying a bh palette for cheaper price on their website.</li>
    <li> Love the colors but one of the colors were broke :( so be prepared to have at least one brole</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all the colors of course but the as far as I can tell they are very pigmented. No allergic reaction to anything it is a fun eyeshadow palette.</li>
    <li> The Colors in this palette are really beautiful and the price is not bad either! I really recommend this set, especially if you like neutral colors... If not, the other palette maybe better....</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEEEEE ITTTT!!!! I woulf recommend this product to everyone! Great colors that last all night and for a great price. Mine was shipped with care nothing was broken</li>
    <li> This palette is nice, the colors go on smooth and blend easy, they are not as vibrant and dark as the picture shows, but i have used it everyday since i got it and deff recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH THIS.  The colors are highly pigmented and there are choices of matte and shimmery colors. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> great pigmentation love it</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and makeup artist and this eyeshadow is awesome! It goes on beautifully and stay! Very happy with this buy!</li>
    <li> The shadows have a lot of fall out. I wish they had more matte shades. It was packaged really safely..no broken shadows</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, I love them!!!! and they last a lot, even if you dance all night long</li>
    <li> Nice smooth application, amazing colors...I just like scents an this one doesnt have any!</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Can mix match them all and I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying eye shadows anymore. Must get</li>
    <li> decently priced, wonderful colors! my issue is that some of the colors don&#x27;t look the same until you swatch it. this often can kill a makeup look if you aren&#x27;t careful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the colors didn&#x27;t feel chalky but felt smooth and satiny. long lasting, brilliant colors too! totally better than hitting up a drugstore any day!</li>
    <li> These are very nice pigmented colors. For the price I am very satisfied. With primer these colors last all day.</li>
    <li> I really love this eye shadow palette. Of course I did tons of research on it before making the purchase, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because my black eye shadow was completely shattered. I believe you can return/exchange it, but because I already have tons of black, I wasn&#x27;t too worried. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> really lovely palette .. bright colors.. loved them ! only one color was broken otherwise super like! &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;loved it</li>
    <li> I am a professinal makeup artist. I&#x27;ve tried lots of affordable makeup palettes. I would recommend a couple of other companies for the same price. This eyeshadow palette has nice warm pastel tone colors but it is hard to blend on your eyelid even though I use MAC primer and MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, these eyeshadows are awesome. They&#x27;re highly pigemented and with a decent primer they stay on all day long. They arrived with two shadows cracked, but they quality of the product was so good that I didn&#x27;t even care to complain or ask for a replacement. I&#x27;ve used just about every color in the palate so far and I haven&#x27;t experienced any dried out or hard to apply shadows, nor did these shadows cause irritation or make my eyes burn. For all those who chose to complain, this is a 150 palate for 25.00. You can&#x27;t beat that anywhere and you get what you pay for.. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about how good this product would be because of the low price but after receiving the product it has become my favorite eyeshadow. I like it more than my MAC products.I have light brown skin and it shows up on me beautifully great product!</li>
    <li> the shadows from this palette are awesome super pigmented and with different finishes which is cool the colourful side of it i WOULDN&#x27;T describe as NEON i think it is more like intense and bold colours and it&#x27;s pretty it&#x27;s also a good palette because of the variety of shades it has and the warm colours are also very good for either a smokey eye look or a natural look very recommendable</li>
    <li> Shany eyeshadows are the best eyeshadows I have ever used. They are so pigmented and blend easily. The color choices are amazing. And once it goes on its on. It takes a really good makeup remover to get it off. I will totally be buying the bright and bold 120 palett next. I would totally recommend this to anyone who wants high quality eyeshadow for an unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> Awesome color selection for a great price :) Non of the pots were broken. Some colors take a lot of layers to see vividly but a white eye shadow primer helps!</li>
    <li> Iffy about this. The swatches on my fingers are PERFECT. So pigmented. But on my eyelid they&#x27;re dedinitely not vibrant. They&#x27;re decent with a primer.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome palate. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because you have to put a lot of it on in order for the color to appear on your skin (fair toned).</li>
    <li> so it looks like the lady loves this alot and is very thankful for her xmas gift! thank you very mucgh!</li>
    <li> I bought this palette as a present so I did not use it myself. It arrived on time, the packaging was great and none of the cells were broken or smeared. The colors look nice and bright and very cute. Made an excellent gift!</li>
    <li> Nice color, very complete, neutral colors are beatiful, lasts long, A litlle more lose than Mac for example, but it is not a problem.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice.  It&#x27;s a small amount of each so not sure how long it&#x27;ll last, but the darkest black cracked and got on some of the colors.  The purple also arrived cracked with is my daughter&#x27;s favorite color.  I&#x27;m still happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It had many colors to pick from and there is a generous amount of each color as well. In order to make the colors brighter I use a damp brush while applying. With a eye primer this eyeshadow lasts me all day.</li>
    <li> I got this for a christmas present from my mom and at first i had a bit of a hard time getting the lighter shades to be noticible. in order for the lighter colors to be even noticible you have to use a lot or just use some eyeshadow base first it also does not stay on very long without eyeshadow base this is why i did not give it 5 stars but i do like it and would buy it again. for some reason as far as shipping goes my mom ordered this and two other items and this was on regular shipping and the other two were on two day shipping and all the items were by the same person but yet this one the regular shipping one arrived before the rest that were on two day shipping but arrived before it said it would by two days does not make sense but okay ha. i would recomend this product to people who are patient or people who don&#x27;t mind buying eyeshadow base.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. She just loves this! I was impressed with the quality of the eye shadows and the fact that there are 120 colors is great! For the price, it is hard to beat. This is a fun palette for any one to use. It&#x27;s great  to be able to play with so many colors.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased when I received my product today. The delivery was quick and the product arrived undamaged. I will place another review when I have tested the product.</li>
    <li> I bought my daughter this palette for Christmas and the requests keep on coming !! Very versatile - ordered one for my daughter (just turned 20), one for my sister (in her 30&#x27;s), and one for my co-worker (50+).  The colors are very pretty and are awesome when blended!</li>
    <li> love the makeup with these eye shadows. it was on time and it seems just like in photos.&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PALETTE! I&#x60;m a dark-skinned African American (think Bria Myles) and all of the colors show up on my complexion so lovely. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even need to use a base. There&#x27;s a mixture of warm/cool colors, night/day looks, and shimmer/matte. If I have some time I will show some make up looks that I&#x60;ve done with this. Also the packaging was very secure and NONE of the colors were cracked or loose. I RECOMMEND this for beginners and MUA&#x60;s alike. Especially for my deeper complected African American sisters.</li>
    <li> The colors are great, however you have to put a lot of product on for it to show. Other than that for the price it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, bold pigments</li>
    <li> I like that variety of colors available but expected them to be much more pigmented.  I have to apply a lot in order to get the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I needed a color plaette for my new makeup collection and this did just the job! I will be ordering more shany products in the future and plan on doing a Make up tutorial on youtube :)</li>
    <li> When I revived this four of the shadows were broken and so was the casing. But the colors are lovely and very pigmented so I will give it 3 stars for that.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the pigment- color payoff in this palette. The colors are gorgeous...just wish there were larger &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow palette is very awesome for trying new looks, everyday eye make-up, and parties, but the little eyeshadows are a little small. :P</li>
    <li> These eye shadows blend like a dream. They are so natural looking and with a primer they don&#x27;t go anywhere. There is no to minimal creasing when in use and all brush types (synthetic, real, blend) pick the color up. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 Stars is because two of the colors came completely broken. Thankfully they were colors that I probably wouldn&#x27;t use anyway but had they been highly usable colors it may have been a different story.</li>
    <li> this has all the colors you would need from netruals to neon colors and the size is convenent for travel</li>
    <li> Shipping was really fast, the colors are beautiful, the box it comes in is so amazing, very good price, everything Is just perfect ! I Lo Lo Love it</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and they go on smoothly and they stay on.  Excellent shimmer colors very satisfied with the selection of colors.</li>
    <li> My palettes came in a box, nicely packaged, and arrived without any damage to the beautiful color. Not even a crack! I was so excited I tried out my colors right away! I put it on around 12pm (noon) today and washed my face before bed just now (about 11:30pm) and my eye make up was still completely perfect! I personally do not use primer and had no issues, my shadow stayed out with zero smudges or lines from oils in the skin and I had it on almost 12 hours. My eyes are also mega sensitive and i wear contacts. some brands of shadows i cant wear without tearing eyes and burning but this shadow didn&#x27;t bother me all day today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of each color is about a nickel and I found a little goes a very long way. I&#x27;m pretty sure this palette will last a real long time. Totally worth the money. It&#x27;s hard to find such a good product for such a good price. Vivid and fun colors! Applies so smooth. My eyes look like I had a pro come do them. ADD TO CART! :)</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had me order this for her as a part of her Christmas makeup package. She says she liked how many colors came with the set, but that the individual colors are a little small.</li>
    <li> I just started getting into make up and tried Shany for the first time ever. I love this palette, it has fun to casual colors good for any time of the day. It stays on for a long amount of time and is great quality over all. I work at a hospital and do 12 hour shifts, after wearing the make up for about 14 hours, it was still on and look pretty good after a long day! I am buying more of their products!</li>
    <li> when i looked at this item online i loved all the colors but when i got the item the case was dirty, some of the shadows were cracked and some of the colors looked nothing like it was displayed in the picture prior to ordering. i will say that after using it for the first time i was really happy with how the eye shadow  blend very well and how long they last all day.</li>
    <li> Great colors and I got it in great condition</li>
    <li> I look forward to making up my face playing with the different colors.  When paired with a primer, the colors really pop and last long without creasing.  I&#x27;m not a big make-up girl and  just really getting into what I like and I fell asleep wearing this product and it was still visible the next say with no smearing.  I think this is excellent for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had this set for at least six months and I still use it every day.  The colors look the same way once applied and last for the entire day with no primer.  Love this set, I haven&#x27;t had to buy eyeshadow in a long time.</li>
    <li> I like this palette I really recommend it if you are looking for like every color but red :(. The colors stay on as I like but it doesn&#x27;t really stay on as much as I&#x27;d like but the colors are sooooo beautiful :D. I&#x27;m not giving this palette a 5 star because my black came shattered as I saw some one also had that issue. I&#x27;m not a huge makeup fan but I like this palette! Thanks for reading my review :) God bless and Jesus loves you!</li>
    <li> I consider myself a makeup rookie, and this pallet is great for someone like me who is just experimenting with colors and application. It arrived timely and has 2 pallets of colors inside.</li>
    <li> Nice range of colors that apply true to color and last through the day. I use this daily and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> this makeup is very true to color and goes on and blends nicely. It has matte and shimmer, a lot of beautiful vibrant colors for the dramatic looks, and more neutral tones for everyday looks. All my friends keep asking my where I got my pallet!</li>
    <li> I love this pallete!! So many colors. I&#x27;m ready for winter, spring, and fall with this palette. The bright are def bright. If you&#x27;re not getting the pigment saturation you&#x27;re looking for, try wetting your brush first and then applying eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, especially if you use eyeshadow primer with it! The colors really pop and they look just as good in pictures as they do in person ♡ Definitely will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I love make up and recently i get this palette to use it with my costumers and its realy amazing all the colors are perfect they blend perfectly and once you try it....... you gonna love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great pigmentation and great prices highly recommend for beginners who want to experiment  with color eyeshadows big variety of colors.</li>
    <li> so many colors to chose from!&lt;br /&gt;the only thing was when i got it the black was broken but it doesnt really matter i dont use black</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEEE THIS PALETTE THE COLORS ARE ALL AMAZING !!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS. ITS WORTH SPENDING MONEY ON !!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!  She is a fashionista!!!! She loves all of the colors in the palette.  She recommends it to anyone!</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was worried I would receive this with one ore more eyeshadow pallets broken, but when I received it, nothing was broken. I really like the variations of colors, and they are all easy to apply. The only things I don&#x27;t like about it are that it smells weird, and at the end of the day it doesn&#x27;t look so great- so I would re-apply it throughout the day if I were you.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I think this product is good.</li>
    <li> This makeup set is great for how much you pay for it, the colors are surprisingly pigmented and i got it completely intact.</li>
    <li> ITS A MUST BUY!!!!!!  pErIOd!! very much worth it . dont listen to the haters this pallette is whatsup!!!!! :):)</li>
    <li> The palette is reasonably priced.  Arrived much sooner than expected.  Packaging was quite good, no residue or chipped/broken pots. Quite pleased with the array of colors - highly pigmented.  The only con is that some of the colors are quite &amp;#34;colorful&amp;#34; and not to my taste as a woman who is 40+ years. The good thing is that I can mix them or tone them down if I wish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews saying that a lot of the reviews are fake. Fact is, it&#x27;s a good product and with the variety of color and how pigmented the colors are, I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I would consider this to anyone for everyday makeup. With this many choices it&#x27;s hard to decide what to wear</li>
    <li> Nice leather carrier Some of the brushes look/are duplicates...im new to the whole make-up thing so maybe thats how theyre supposed to be..not a big deal to me. HOWEVER, I WAS DISSAPOINTED that my first few useses my foundation brush was shedding a little. Other than that theyre good.</li>
    <li> Would be better if the top pallet was attach to the top so u don&#x27;t have to lift it up.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow palette!!! i use it everyday!! i love how it has bright colors for special occasions but also colors that you can use everyday. Once i get more familiar with using and mixing my colors i will definitely buy the other one that has all the bright colors!!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> The packaging was great. Only one color out of the entire palette was broken on arrival. The colors are beautiful and apply well with a primer. They are not super saturated so some really bold looks may be out, but I&#x27;ve been able to create some really nice blends. Very pleased and would purchase from SHANY again.</li>
    <li> is amazing the colors are perfect. im very satisfied with this product , i recomended too much- im very excited about that, thank you.</li>
    <li> Mac! and other highend eyeshadows only w/o the steep price ! I use this palette at least 3x a week worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product! I really like the colors and it stays good on the skin. The shipping was great because the eyeshadow came perfect.</li>
    <li> Great beginner&#x27;s kit! I&#x27;m getting into eye shadows again and wanted a palette with a lot of color options. This has a great variety of options from neon to neutral to bright and fun! Additionally, the pigment is great. A little goes a long way. Again, I&#x27;m a beginner, but I&#x27;m very happy with this and wish I&#x27;d bought it BEFORE I bought the highly coveted Naked 1 palette, which I honestly feel was kind of a waste of money as all the colors look the same on my skin to me (I&#x27;m an NW 48 in StudioFix Fluid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I like it. I would have LOVED it if my product wasn&#x27;t damaged. I received this palette and not 1...2...3, but FIVE of my shadows were completely shattered. I had to press them back together with my fingers and I was extremely disappointed. The box that holds both of the palettes was also damaged. At first I thought maybe it had occurred during shipping, however once I looked into the packaging, the other piece was not in there, which further disappointed me because that means I was intentionally shipped an already damaged product. If it had occurred during shipping, the other piece would have been in there. It didn&#x27;t magically disappear, right? The eye shadows are beautiful, they have stayed on all day without any primer, and the colors are very vibrant. I love Amazon &amp; all of my products in the past have arrived in A-1 condition but THIS ONE...I feel cheated. I have seen several people on Youtube state that they have received damaged palettes, not just from Amazon, so this has to be a serious company error/issue.</li>
    <li> When I received it, it was all broken. I had eye shadow every where. Couldn&#x27;t even use it. I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> Well packed, arrived on time. Item as described. It was a gift for my sister in law and she is crazy with it. I recommended! The colors are accurate!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mixed bag, some colors blend well some don&#x27;t I like the bright colors but even with a decent primer such as urban decays and nyx and smash box I find that it&#x27;s staying power is bland and it tends to fade. Perhaps it&#x27;s my technique.But If I had an option I would stick to Urban Decays shadows. I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t like this pallete but there were alot of things that made me disapointed in the purchase. I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to think of it. I like it and dislike it . It also smelled like cheap water color dollar store paint. upon opening up the pallete. I&#x27;m not sensitive to smells by any means I more found that amusing, I guess for 25 dollars though you can&#x27;t really complain. I&#x27;ll keep using it perhaps my opinion would change once I perfected my technique some more.</li>
    <li> i loved it it came with the colors that were on the picture. thanks :) and its very happy to play with these</li>
    <li> I love shany cosmetics! This palette comes with TONS of bright and neutral colors in a convenient little palette!The colors are VERY pigmented,but some are a bit chalky! Great price with twice as many colors as the coatal scents 88 palette for the SAME price! LOVE...LOVE...LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking some would be matte and some glitter- there&#x27;s just sparkly and less sparkly. Otherwise good array and looks nice on dark skin.</li>
    <li> It was packaged very well! The colors in the pic seem a bit brighter than the actual shadows in person (I guess that&#x27;s to be expected). They are a bit shimmery but that&#x27;s ok. The price Is good though; I would buy this as a gift for someone!!!</li>
    <li> The colors are good and bold. The palette has a mix of powder and shiny shades to suit the need. But does not offer particularly ALL colors. One downside, it does not have a mirror nor an application brush with it, disappointing for me.</li>
    <li> These shadows are beautiful and fun especially for this price! Talk about value for your money.  They are pretty pigmented which is great, but add water to make them more intense.  Blend pretty well as well!</li>
    <li> I will never buy another eyeshadow palate. The colors were all still intact after shipping and the individual colors are small, but they have a lot of pigment and blended beautifully. And it didn&#x27;t smear or smudge at all after I applied it. Even after hours of working around coffee in the summer and humidity. You won&#x27;t find a better deal than this</li>
    <li> Beautiful eyeshadows came quick just one of them was damaged when I opened it not a big deal</li>
    <li> absolutely excited when it arrived. It was in prefect condition, none of my colors fell out/broke or mixed with&lt;br /&gt;any other color.</li>
    <li> I came across these and loved the colors. Like anything I thought it was too good to be true...but there honestly just as good as my naked Urban decay eye shadows. There bright and fun I love all the colors. Well worth the 20 bucks would recommend them to anyone and will be definitely buying another when the time comes</li>
    <li> Love it. . So vibrant</li>
    <li> These are amazing colors! They work great! You get alot of colors. Very vibrant colors. Great nutrals. I wish there was a bright red though... and when I got it my black had been broken!</li>
    <li> AHH I love this palette so much! I own so many brand name palettes such as Mac, Urban Decay, Too faced, Smashbox, the list goes on and on and this palette proves that you don&#x27;t need to sacrifice quality by paying less. I did a pink smokey eye with this palette and the application was amazing, the colors were extremely pigmented and lasted ALL day! I&#x27;m amazed!</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing! I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t be very pigmented, but that wasn&#x27;t the problem. (ehh a FEW of the purple ones weren&#x27;t super pigmented but the rest....AWESOME!!) I&#x27;m very happy I got this and I might end up buying the other sets as well!</li>
    <li> This set did everything I wanted it to. The color selection is great! The colors are vibrant on my eyelids, and they last a long time. The colors don&#x27;t look cheap while wearing them either. I&#x27;m completely happy with this eye shadow palette.</li>
    <li> The colors are so beautiful</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette are very vivid both in pictures and on the website, however they do NOT go on this way. They lack pigment and are very dull and unattractive when they go on. I even used Urban Decay eye lid primer which can make even the cheapest of make up brands look decent... It didn&#x27;t help. This makeup, in my opinion, has worse quality than Claire&#x27;s. You get more color from running a crayola crayon over your eyelid. Very disappointed. I have passed this down to my little sister who uses it for dress up now.</li>
    <li> Me and my roommate loooove this palette i have nothing bad to say about.. it was packaged tight all the colors were in tact.. i will be purchasing again... love the diversity of the palette, i would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> So, I bought this shadow palette because I need to make my makeup pop, like my clothes. The palette was well packaged and arrived on time. I am a bit disappointed that the lighter colors don&#x27;t show that much after applying them. So I came up with what I like to call the \\&quot;sticky technique\\&quot;. Before applying the shadow, I apply a hint of lip gloss to my eye lids. Successful result every time. My shadow lasts long and the colors are bright. And I love how it comes off easily too.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this palette when I saw the price. I had recently bought a profusion palette for about the same amount, and the colors, though nice, wore off in only a few hours. Just got my palette in a few days ago, and I am in love. Not only are the colors intensely bright after me wearing it from 8 am to 11:00 pm!, but there is such a great range. If your the same type of girl like me who loves to play with color but doesn&#x27;t like to wear anything too flashy this palette is a must! It has great earth tones, coupled with some nice neon brights, so that I can kick it up a notch without going to far outside my comfort zone. As a note I have been wearing it with eye primer, so I don&#x27;t know how it would look without.Still, this is a great buy for only twenty dollars!!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! It looks great on my skin color and last all day long. It&#x27;s really great for me.</li>
    <li> I just received this eye pallet and I love it. The colors stay on all day and I&#x27;ve even had compliments on my makeup since using it. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because a few of my colors were shattered. Otherwise great product. This brand should come out with a more shimmery glittery pallet as well. I would totally buy it :)</li>
    <li> Love this palette!  the colors are pigmented and bright.  There is some fallout, but it&#x27;s easily cleaned off with a Q-tip.</li>
    <li> Love the product and color selection for the price. Nothing else like it! No need for other eye shadow kits!</li>
    <li> The natural palette is great for everyday looks, and the neon, and bright colored is great for when I had to go to weddings, or just wanted to dress up a little. Very pigmented, long-lasting, goes on and comes off easily when you go to clean your makeup off. It won&#x27;t cake on.</li>
    <li> finally bright eyeshadows that works for me. i do not even need to apply it so many times to have the desired color. its bright and so many colors to choose from depending on what u wearing. i am loving this</li>
    <li> It works really well. Affordable. Came to me quick! Iam greatly pleased with this product and considering buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter as a gift.  She just loves the many choices of colors. I love the value of this product as well as the great quality of the product.  One of my best valued purchases.</li>
    <li> I think the colors themselves would have been pretty if they showed up. They were very light, almost non-existant. I love make up and color, but this was just not for me.</li>
    <li> These colors are awesome! Such a great deal also. I was very happy with this purchase and will definitely be buying more of the Shany products.</li>
    <li> The colours are beautiful and the make up itself it great. I thought while i was ordering it i would get some cheapy plastic colours but they have good variety, lots of colours and the make up itself wears long and barely smudges or flakes even after a few hard nights of work. I must say i am impressed and will continue to purchase items from this particular line of cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I was kind of back and fourth if I should order from BH  or Coastal Scents but I liked that this SHANY palette because it includes two in one the nude palette and neon colors. The packaging was perfect and nothing was broken or falling out. I really can see how these colors will work on dark skin. Sometimes its difficult to find eyeshadow that looks good on dark skin.I hope to use this palette for my tutorials. I think that its nice that upscale cosmetices create palettes affordable for the working woman. Ladies save some money and order this one.</li>
    <li> I recived my peoduct on time bubble warapped and boxed. The colors are exactly what i wanted.i&#x27;d rather get this then go to m.a.c. just to get one eyeshadow for a higher price. Thank you shany company awesome product.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was kind of worried about this product after I bought it... but today I received it and I am so HAPPY with it.... I love it. It came perfectly wrapped...&lt;br /&gt;I will always recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this palette! The colors are nice and solid (it looks bright/dark/solid on your skin, not just a thin, pale version of what&#x27;s on the pallette), and they stay for a good while (definitely not all day, though). The colors haven&#x27;t blended together at all, there isn&#x27;t a bunch of powder all over the inside - very clean! The case is well-made, it doesn&#x27;t fall open, the hinges haven&#x27;t broken (like 99% of these things), and I don&#x27;t break a nail opening it. The only thing that it needs is a mirror in the lid, and maybe a brush. Then it would be absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> the eyeshadow i love it you can mix them you can put it on any way and the colors are great the way you can make them as dark or add some light color to make dark a little lighter! and this isn&#x27;t the only one i have more of them same compnay! than you!</li>
    <li> It was ok; I would have like more shimmery or iridescent colors and definately more blues. It&#x27;s a good addition to makeup package.</li>
    <li> its just amazing..I used the grey yesterday morning and it stayed on until that night when i was getting ready for bed.I have everything from Shany her stuff is great quality just love her.</li>
    <li> One of the colors were broken but other than that I love the pallets and colors where very pigmented. Will order more products in the future</li>
    <li> I Really love the colors but mine came broken one side of the hinges were broken also a couple of the eyeshadow pots were broken. It was probably because it came in a box with other items; but I had to return it and I&#x27;m waiting on my new palette to come later on today. I love amazon primes 2 day free shipping option :)))) this is the best palette I&#x27;ve had so far...  I just received my new palette it&#x27;s perfect it&#x27;s not broken everything is intact I love it!!!  I can wait to use it!!!!</li>
    <li> Pigmentation is not very saturated and it wears off very easily. I do not rub my eyes at all when I wear my makeup, but by the time I get home from work, the shadow is near gone.</li>
    <li> My palette was wrapped in two or three layers of bubble wrap and wasn&#x27;t not broken nor were there any loose powders. I quickly tested out the colors on my hand and i find that the neons and shimmers shown up the best. The mattes needed a couple layers to show up.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the darker palette it goes on very smooth and blends well. The lighter palette, even with eyelid primer, not so much. Very chalky on my skin. Next time just buying the darker set alone.</li>
    <li> I am a VERY big fan of neon/vibrant colors, but I also like to tone it down a bit and look a little bit more natural... this product was PERFECT for me! Loving all of the colors and the multiple choices, love that some of them have glitter and some of them don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m just in love with it all together!</li>
    <li> So many colors! very beautiful shades! the picture doesn&#x27;t do justice to the palette... If you want variety in eyeshadow, buy this palette... you won&#x27;t regret it...</li>
    <li> Some of these colors are much lighter than you would expect with application, but ultimately I absolutely love this pallet. This is my first color pallet, and my opinion may be inaccurate because I am really just getting into makeup for the first time, so I may not know as much as what to expect as far as pigmentation goes, but I still LOVE this pallet. The colors are easy to apply, they blend wonderfully, and there are corresponding so creating a lovely look is easy.&lt;br /&gt;All in all great product, would like for the yellows to be a bit more pigmented though.</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;m using my boyfriend&#x27;s account)&lt;br /&gt;I Just relieved my package in the mail and I&#x27;m so excited!&lt;br /&gt;LOTS of bubble wrap! NON of the eye shadows were broken! :D&lt;br /&gt;Some of the colors don&#x27;t show up on my skin but I&#x27;m still happy. Good for a Beginner! Not professional makeup but still good quality for a beginner like me. Always remember you get what you pay for. So I can&#x27;t compare this makeup to MAC which would have been way over a $100 for a palette of this size. So keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;But I am Still Very happy with what I got! Now i get to practice and get better at my makeup and then I&#x27;ll be able to move on to a \\&quot;higher lever\\&quot; of products.&lt;br /&gt;My FAVORITE thing about this palette is the Black is AMAZING! All the black shadows i&#x27;ve owned in my life were very crappy and i would have to layer and layer and it still wouldn&#x27;t be black enough...&lt;br /&gt;this black is just what I wanted! It awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY thing that  concerned me was that the \\&quot;Fragile\\&quot; sticker was ON the product inside of the box and NOT on the box...I&#x27;m sure glad that there was soo much bubble wrap because I&#x27;m sure it would have been broken if there wasn&#x27;t since the sticker wasn&#x27;t on the box.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and I was very excited to open it and see so many colors in the palette. I love the color choices. There are enough options for just about any look, whether it&#x27;s natural, dramatic, or anywhere in between. I normally wear MAC eyeshadows, so it&#x27;s hard not to compare the two. The powder in this palette is a little looser and you need to apply more of it. I normally tap off excess powder from my makeup brush, but it&#x27;s not necessary with these eyeshadows. In fact, I personally don&#x27;t recommend it because half of the powder falls off. I also notice that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long. Perhaps I need to use an eyeshadow primer to make it last longer?&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I still like the palette because it allows me to play with so many colors. I would recommend this to someone who loves makeup, but doesn&#x27;t have the budget for more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my first Shany palette so I knew that I was going to love this palette. The colors are so pigmented and vibrant!! The eyeshadow lasts all day too. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the only color it&#x27;s missing is red but other than that this palette is perfect!!! It is so worth every penny!!!!</li>
    <li> O.K warm colors but the bright colors are HORRIBLE. I ordered this palette for the nice different colors that are on it and it came really soon (I believed it came 1 day before it was supposed to arrived) I got the palette for Halloween since I&#x27;m really good with stage make-up so I thought that this was going to be great for my 5 costumes this year 2012, But the bright colors DO NOT SHOW ON SKIN no matter how much you put on (I&#x27;m Hispanic male Tan 4 X&#x27;s a week) so I have great complexion for the colors to pop but did not, not even on my little siblings when I was doing their Halloween make-up. I threw the bottom palette but kept the top with the warm colors [ex: brown,black,nude,white. etc] I kept the top palette because I use the soft browns for shading in my eyebrows and works wonderfully and lasts all day. I only use for eyebrows because it does not work for me as eye-shadows AT ALL. Came wrapped perfectly and without any crushed colors  (I&#x27;ll stick to buying my eye-shadows at Sephora&amp;Mac)</li>
    <li> I got this palette because I wanted a started kit. Something with almost every color. It has the brights along with the neutrals. The color goes on great and it was bubble wrapped well in the package. I love the case it comes in. Love this product and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Arrived in less than 48 hours and is exactly what I expected. I love it!</li>
    <li> It came quick, nothing broke or crack which is fantastic. I have light skin and it is very vibrant and easy to apply. Very pleased....</li>
    <li> I like all the colors, but I wish they were more pigmented.</li>
    <li> All the colors needed...Just Fab!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this and its a very good starter kit. The colors are true and they go on pretty smooth. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> It has so many colors[[ASIN:B0061KQEVW SHANY Cosmetics Professional Cream Foundation and Camouflage Concealer 15 Color Palette, 13 Ounce]] and they all are true to its color. I will be getting another one soon, I would suggest this ONE to anyone.[[ASIN:B0061JQY40 SHANY Cosmetics NY Collection Pro Brush Kit, 13 Ounce (22 Piece Mix Natural or Synthetic with Purple Faux Crocodile Case)]]</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this set of eye shadows because of the wide variety of colours and shades. I received it in the mail and I&#x27;m in love with it. The options that are there for you to mix are endless. I would recommend using a really good primer to make sure you get a vibrant look. They came in a beautiful case and was carefully wrapped to avoid any breakage during shipment. I would definitely recommend this to get the value of your money.</li>
    <li> I want to commend the company \\&quot;Shanty Cosmetics\\&quot; for the great service. My package came earlier then expected and thanks for the emails on my order status. The packaging was great and my palettes was secure &amp; protected from any damage. I haven&#x27;t used the palettes yet but I will soon &amp; I will return with a review of the product. Thanku</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, it wasn&#x27;t damaged, packaged nicely (very nice slim design). Great colors that last all day! Highly impressed, will be great for my makeup tutorial videos on Youtube. I will definitely recommend this to everyone I know and will buy more makeup from this company!</li>
    <li> I love it! I use them everyday &amp; there are so awesome to wear. easy &amp; last longer if you use a primer first.  Best quality for a great price!!!</li>
    <li> This product actually came in 3 days after placing the order so that was really exciting! I love how there&#x27;s neutral colors as well as neon and bright colors, over all it&#x27;s just a great investment for a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use many of the colors yet, but am  thus far extremely satisfied with the quality of the shadows.  The colors are vibrant and both build and blend nicely.  They are certainly worth the meager investment.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom at Christmas. She loves the variety of colors. Some are really light, but most of them are vibrant and easy to apply. The color lasts most of the day with reapplication required occasionally. One or two of the shades were broken when I received it, but they were the darker black ones so I didn&#x27;t mind. Still, this company needs to upgrade their packaging method or inspect the eye-shadows before they ship them because I read many other reviews complaining about the broken shadows.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow palette. The colors go on perfectly and last all day. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for high quality eye shadows.  I am a woman of color and all the colors I have used so far work just perfectly for my skin tone. Purchase this eyeshadow palette and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter.  She went absolutely balistic.  She said it was &amp;#34;better that sliced bread&amp;#34;  what ever that means.  I guess it was a hit.  She used it in her photography on her female models and says she has been able to create some amazing looks.</li>
    <li> The colors are very vivid and everything arrived unbroken and wrapped well.  Great deal for the price, lots of beautiful shades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a MAC girl but want a colorful palette to choose from for summer without spending too much money. This product gives you more than enough in color choice and the pigments are very strong which means you only need a little to go a long way. I highly recommend this product and am very happy with this cost-effective, high quality product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 120 piece eye shadow set and received it right away and in perfect condition. The colors are vibrant and long lasting. This product is great!</li>
    <li> Love love it. Its a must buy!!</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow set it perfect and it has all the colors i need ! I totally recommend getting this !</li>
    <li> This palette offers so many color varieties and the makeup stays put in their individual compartments.  It&#x27;s not an HD makeup or high pigment so you will need a primer, but when they are coupled the colors will pop.</li>
    <li> I like that it has pretty much any color and most of them have good pigmentation. Expect at least one shadow to be cracked when you receive it. It really is a fun palette to have if you want something cheap with decent pigmentation.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the picture no shadows were broken and comes in a very fancy shadow holder. They are so beautiful and for the price even better. So many options to choose from !</li>
    <li> I have found the colours are perfect although the main colour which most women use isn&#x27;t in this palette which is black. It is also not silky enough, a little to powdery doesn&#x27;t go on without having it all over your face due to the texture</li>
    <li> When I received the eye shadows today upon opening I discovered that several of the eye shadows were cracked and crumbling. The container is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I received this palette so QUICK!!! It was amazing. I&#x27;ve never received anything I&#x27;ve ordered offline that fast. After it shipped it was here the next morning. I was so shocked. This is a great palette to purchase because it has ALL the colors you need in it. From the naturals to the neons. I tried the palette out this past Sunday and the colors came off onto the brush so smoothly. The colors are really pretty when you apply them to your eyes. I did a natural look and the brown I used was perfect and lasted all day. I really love this palette! I love SHANY! I ordered other items from Shany as well along with this palette and I love them all. I will definitely be purchasing more from this comapny. As of right now they are at the top of my list. I love the colors! I love everything. I cannot WAIT to do my Valentines Day look with this palette.</li>
    <li> As described and more.  These shadows are amazing, colors go on smooth, easy to blend and stay true to color.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend Shany</li>
    <li> love the colors! the color you see its the color you get, unlike other brands where you see an awesome color you like and then find out after you&#x27;ve purchased it that the application is lighter than the color you see on the palate. I couldnt afford MAX and even if I could I would still get this. the case is kinda takes an effort to open but I would rather it shut tight than come open in my makup bag and the product get ruined. Highly recommend this product to the diva on a budget! :)</li>
    <li> I really love this product. The shadows are pigmented and not baby powder fine or flaky. With a good primer these go a long way. I also love the compact size I travel constantly and this is so easy to slip in my tote bag! Only negative is there is no mirror on the inside. It packs so many great colors that you wont feel without any options. Cute buy and I will definitely order a few of these for some girlfriends as party favors.</li>
    <li> All of the colors I wear!!!! This comes in a cute compact case that folds in half, it&#x27;s small enough that it fits in my cosmetic bag!!! The colors go on smooth and stay the same color and darkness all day!!!</li>
