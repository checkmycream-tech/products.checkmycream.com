      <li>It seems to work ok, nothing I would call &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;a must have&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I use this product along with most of the othr items dermasilk makes.</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;ve been using it as more of a makeup primer, rather than a lotion...</li>
      <li>There are others that work way better.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>

      <li>very quick service A+++</li>
      <li>If you like the trial, then you can order more for full price.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate enough to try a sample of this and loved it!</li>
      <li>This smooths out fine lines and helps to keep make-up in place.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is for a photo-shoot, a job interview, a class reunion, an event - when you need to look GREAT and a bit younger</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price..used my CVS coupon and $5.00 extra bucks, but did a great job covering wrinkles..</li>
      <li>Quick, easy product that works</li>
      <li>I was a skeptic at first because I have tried many creams that claim anti-wrinkles/aging.  </li>
      <li>i had a warm sensation and tightness and my lines are completely gone!</li>
      <li>Right!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to see much of a difference in my skin, but have had more friends commenting on my &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; appearance than ever before--something that didn&#x27;t happen even when I was using high-priced salon products.</li>
      <li>I felt a mild tingling sensation and my face felt</li>
      <li>It is a quick fix and not a permanent one</li>
      <li>This cream really does get rid of fine lines around eyes.</li>
      <li>well worth the money for the wanted results</li>
      <li>I also bought the instant eye lift, well I read all instructions carefully to be sure I did it correctly.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, the difference was so noticeable</li>
      <li>have applied it exactly as instructed...</li>
      <li>I should have read the reviews first and saved my money....</li>
      <li>All I can say is that it must really work for some skin types because I know it works for me!  </li>
      <li>When I first bought it, I tested the product one hand and saw a noticeable difference/improvement in smoothness of my skin.</li>
      <li>Not a permanent fix or a treatment but a great cover up especially when you use minimal makeup</li>
      <li>To me, it does not seem like it does a whole lot, and</li>
      <li>and I real do like the product.</li>
      <li>i really like the way this works.</li>
      <li>They refused to offer any retribution for a product that absolutely does nothing for wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I only put the product on one side of my face , I&#x27;m 32 years old with just fine lines around eyes, mouth and forehead.</li>
      <li>And what&#x27;s more, no improvement in wrinkles, I just looked like a dead wrinkled woman.  </li>
      <li>It fills in pores and erases small wrinkles giving one a more youthful look.</li>
      <li>Nice product, if used properly- a LITTLE  bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>yet, I have had several positive comments on my skin since I started wearing it.  </li>
      <li>It made my skin feel tight and actually you can see my wrinkles even more with it on</li>
      <li>similar to some very high-end brands out there, as well as products used for professional TV and Movie shoots.</li>
      <li>This evens my skin tone and gives a soft, matte finish that does, indeed, reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>its gone, so NO crying ladies, and watch the eye drops too.</li>
      <li>I really think people should definitely give these products a try.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel smooth, but so do other facial products for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
      <li>i have small fine lines under my eye area</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve barely used the product!  </li>
      <li>Do keep in mind the results are pretty instant, they are temporary - there are other products out there that offer long-term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Those who gave it positive reviews must have very minimal concerns or very different skin types to claim it worked for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>would highly recommend you look at the number of negative reviews vs. the positive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> the next time I used it a little more, the next time a little less, but no matter what I did, I saw the same results...</li>
<li> To add I&#x27;m not sure it would do much for deep wrinkles but fines lines</li>
<li> It is strange to see people who don&#x27;t like it</li>
<li> Since I have found this product the only other thing I use is under eye moisturizer at night and the rest</li>
<li> No, really, the strange matte finish literally delivers a finish that looks like make-up used in the morgue.</li>

<li> Partly due to this product.</li>
<li> Tip If you have dry skin put on a small does of moisterizer let that seep into your skin then put this product on.</li>
<li> I noticed that it also seems to camoflauge my dark spots and uneven skin tone.</li>
<li> As other reviewers agree, take it from those of us who have already wasted our money and don&#x27;t waste yours!</li>
<li> I use it everyday</li>
<li> Once you order the trial, cancel your order immediately when you get the product or see a 89.99 charge on your card in a few days.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> This product is a waste of money.  </li>
<li> This product is a waste of $95.00.</li>
<li> This is a waste of money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m just afraid that it will be difficult to buy in the future.</li>
<li> I am disappointed that both Walgreens and Wal-Mart do not carry it anymore.</li>
<li> Awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This cream really does get rid of fine lines around eyes. I was a skeptic at first because I have tried many creams that claim anti-wrinkles/aging.  I use it everyday and I use it all over my face.  It fills in pores and erases small wrinkles giving one a more youthful look.</li>
    <li> This is the only one that worked and I real do like the product.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of $95.00. They refused to offer any retribution for a product that absolutely does nothing for wrinkles. It makes your skin feel smooth, but so do other facial products for a fraction of the cost.  Once you order the trial, cancel your order immediately when you get the product or see a 89.99 charge on your card in a few days. If you like the trial, then you can order more for full price. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of or lessen wrinkles, but it sure makes your wallet a lot lighter. I won&#x27;t deal with this company again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Definitely blurs those wrinkles. The first time I used it, the difference was so noticeable I thought my husband might not recognize me!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I use it specifically on my forehead and neck. Even on my hands at times. I am 41 and look like I am10-15 years younger. Partly due to this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! It makes me look like I have no pores! I wanted to give it a 4.5 but the stars wouldn&#x27;t let me.</li>
    <li> For a product that advertises to erase wrinkles in seconds, Erase did not do anything even after waiting hours!!! Although I felt a tightening in my face, my wrinkles were identical to what they were prior to application. Why do I keep hoping a product will actually do what it claims??</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money. I should have never bought it.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY this product, it is a ripoff</li>
    <li> It seems to work ok, nothing I would call &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;a must have&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other comment. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It does absolutely nothing. They claim that it gives you an airbrushed look and that you don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation. Ha ha!! Right!</li>
    <li> Derma silk flawless erase really does what it says! My friends say they don&#x27;t see my wrinkles even if they &amp;#34;zoom&amp;#34; my photo. Or even in person, my friends don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m a senior citizen.</li>
    <li> Put on after concealer (or foundation If you wear it) and then put on powder, bronzer, blush, etc. This smooths out fine lines and helps to keep make-up in place. Not a permanent fix or a treatment but a great cover up especially when you use minimal makeup</li>
    <li> Awful. This stuff made me look like a corpse. No, really, the strange matte finish literally delivers a finish that looks like make-up used in the morgue. And what&#x27;s more, no improvement in wrinkles, I just looked like a dead wrinkled woman.  In my opinion aging skin needs a bit of a dewy finish. A matte finish magnifies the look of wrinkles. As other reviewers agree, take it from those of us who have already wasted our money and don&#x27;t waste yours!</li>
    <li> It is strange to see people who don&#x27;t like it and then people who do. I LOVE IT!!  The Erase is the one I like the best and it does erase!!  I am disappointed that both Walgreens and Wal-Mart do not carry it anymore. I don&#x27;t have a CVS Pharmacy close to me so I will be ordering it from Amazon. All I can say is that it must really work for some skin types because I know it works for me!  I&#x27;m just afraid that it will be difficult to buy in the future. This is a product I am thrilled to have found and hope it will be around forever!!</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday.. Waited until kids were in bed and entired my bathroom to start my testing. I also bought the instant eye lift, well I read all instructions carefully to be sure I did it correctly. I only put the product on one side of my face , I&#x27;m 32 years old with just fine lines around eyes, mouth and forehead. I saw a difference almost immediately especially my forehead which is a Tyra Banks kinda forehead. I will return to Cvs today to purchase the rest instock while its on sale for only $7.!!! To add I&#x27;m not sure it would do much for deep wrinkles but fines lines definitely seen some improvement.</li>
    <li> i really like the way this works. It helps w/ wrinkles and helps pores appear smaller. I can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore though</li>
    <li> I have not received my order as yet but I have used the product before and it works well.  I am trying this in place of the hydroxatone because of price.  Perhaps will use both.  One in the morning and the other in the night.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles, but it&#x27;s definitely a great temporary fix!  When I first bought it, I tested the product one hand and saw a noticeable difference/improvement in smoothness of my skin. Really impressed and have no idea how it works, but i really like it!! So, now I use it on the back of my hands daily. Also, I&#x27;ve been using it as more of a makeup primer, rather than a lotion...i mix it with my foundation or tinted moisturizer and my skin looks great all day!!&lt;br /&gt;Will def keep buying this product!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I just bought it and i couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on. i have small fine lines under my eye area and i put this product on (Dermasilk flawless)and i had a warm sensation and tightness and my lines are completely gone! So i put some on my nose area cause i have big pores, and it worked there too.. This stuff is awesome I would tell anyone to buy this product! Tip If you have dry skin put on a small does of moisterizer let that seep into your skin then put this product on.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews first and saved my money....I can honestly tell you that this product made no difference at all for me.  I felt a mild tingling sensation and my face felt like I had a mask on it, but I could not see ANY improvement, not even on the finest lines/pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have applied it exactly as instructed...the next time I used it a little more, the next time a little less, but no matter what I did, I saw the same results...-0-...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who gave it positive reviews must have very minimal concerns or very different skin types to claim it worked for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend you look at the number of negative reviews vs. the positive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have money to risk wasting, I would not recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money.  There are others that work way better.  Plus, the pump stopped pumping and I&#x27;ve barely used the product!  Go for Garnier 5 second Blur...now that works!</li>
    <li> This evens my skin tone and gives a soft, matte finish that does, indeed, reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  It is especially effective over moisturizer or foundation.</li>
    <li> Just like the other reviews say. It does not work. I seen no differance at all. It made my skin feel tight and actually you can see my wrinkles even more with it on</li>
    <li> This product does minimize pores. Also, keep oily skin at bay so mineral makeup stays in place all day.  To me, it does not seem like it does a whole lot, and yet, I have had several positive comments on my skin since I started wearing it.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to try a sample of this and loved it! I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price..used my CVS coupon and $5.00 extra bucks, but did a great job covering wrinkles..i put it on after my powder.</li>
    <li> Since I have found this product the only other thing I use is under eye moisturizer at night and the rest twice a day a. I really think people should definitely give these products a try. thank you</li>
    <li> Quick, easy product that works</li>
    <li> I use this product along with most of the othr items dermasilk makes. I use as the directions state to (over my liquid foundation). This product reduces the glare and shine on my skin. I noticed that it also seems to camoflauge my dark spots and uneven skin tone. I dont have a lot of wrinkles (probably because I use the 5 Minute Face Lift) so I love the Flawless for the reasons above!</li>
    <li> thank you! very quick service A+++</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to see much of a difference in my skin, but have had more friends commenting on my &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; appearance than ever before--something that didn&#x27;t happen even when I was using high-priced salon products.</li>
    <li> It makes my eyes look so much younger.  It is a quick fix and not a permanent one but I&#x27;ll take that.  Once you wash your face or get it wet its gone, so NO crying ladies, and watch the eye drops too.</li>
    <li> good product.only problem it can only be used a few times before runs out.</li>
    <li> Nice product, if used properly- a LITTLE  bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very similar to some very high-end brands out there, as well as products used for professional TV and Movie shoots. Do keep in mind the results are pretty instant, they are temporary - there are other products out there that offer long-term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for a photo-shoot, a job interview, a class reunion, an event - when you need to look GREAT and a bit younger this is the one to go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for the guys as well, use it full strength, or mix it with a moisturizer, and you will be good to go. Think of this as a &amp;#34;studio-secret&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Does as it says.  Out performs the others as I have been told.  well worth the money for the wanted results</li>
</ol>
