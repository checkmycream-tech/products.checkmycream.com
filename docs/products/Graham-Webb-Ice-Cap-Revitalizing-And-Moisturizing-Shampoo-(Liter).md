      <li>It is a nice way to start the day.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping and great product</li>
      <li>The shampoo is fine, but what I think made the biggest difference was the Ice Cap Conditioner which I had to purchase via a seller on ebay because all of the Amazon vendors were committing highway robbery on the inflated pricing!</li>
      <li>most of my friends are losing their hair or thiers is thinning and looking brittle.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and the way it feels on my scalp when I shower.</li>

      <li>, so i was so pleased to find online</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it was luck.  </li>
      <li>needs more menthol .</li>
      <li>It might be good genetics or it might be good care, but my hair is still full and soft, and my wife still enjoys running her hands through my hair.</li>
      <li>Felt fortunate to find my favorite shampoo</li>
      <li>My hair looks good and is very controllable.</li>
      <li>not an easy find at all</li>
      <li>Discovered Graham Webb Ice Cap after a friend recommended the line to treat my daughter&#x27;s fine, flyaway hair.</li>
      <li>I was in the process of trying to find another shampoo and got lucky just for looking for Ice Cap one more time.  </li>
      <li>I liked the results so much I use it now myself.</li>
      <li>keep it available....</li>

      <li>I was so excited to find it again.  </li>
      <li>Over the course of my life, I&#x27;ve used a lot of stuff to clean my hair, including lava soap.</li>
      <li>Many Thanks to the Seller</li>
      <li>The price for this liter of shampoo was right in line though at about $17.50 with free prime shipping.</li>
      <li>I just wish I could get refills on the bottle to make it more eco friendly instead of buying a new plastic bottle each time I run out.</li>
      <li>High quality cooling, refreshing, and moisturizing shampoo.</li>
      <li>Grey hair yellows from the sun, but this shampoo seems to keep my silver shiny and bright.  </li>
      <li>clean, refreshing shampoo that leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>Previously reported, great shampoo.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve all enjoyed the scent, refreshing feel, and the way their hair feels after it&#x27;s dried.</li>
      <li>so glad to finally have this again.  </li>
      <li>Years ago my hair stylist recommended this shampoo, I was hooked after the first washing.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair and head feel while shampooing and dry.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
      <li>Oh and by the way, I&#x27;ve had multiple sinus surgeries and my nose doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to, but I can still enjoy Ice Cap&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also a vibrant smell and scalp tingle along with every shampoo.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and then I will try a new shampoo and or conditioner as a change or on the recommendation of my hair stylist, at the end of each bottle</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo in the early 20&amp;#34;s .</li>
      <li>As a shampoo, it does give you a bit of that fresh feeling due to the menthol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough to keep from weighing it down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently decided to stop coloring and go natural salt and pepper.  </li>

    <li> clean, refreshing shampoo that leaves my hair soft. I&#x27;ve recently decided to stop coloring and go natural salt and pepper.

    <li> I love this shampoo.  The smell is so refreshing in the morning and it lathers up beautifully.  It is a nice way to start the day.</li>
    <li> My former local sources for Graham Webb Ice Cap Revitalizing and Moisturizing Shampoo no longer carry this product so I was elated to find it online!!!  This shampoo works well on my white hair because, as the name states, it does moisturize.  I have used this product for probably 15 years and with the availability through Amazon will be able to continue!!!  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> This guy knows how to ship his product! Delivery was quick and shampoo bottles were wrapped incredibly well!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, my wife LOVES this shampoo but I think it is being discontinued :(</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and it&#x27;s wonderful. My hair looks good and is very controllable. Great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the hubby reviewing this shampoo. Over the course of my life, I&#x27;ve used a lot of stuff to clean my hair, including lava soap. I&#x27;m former military and I still keep my hair medium to short length. Years ago my hair stylist recommended this shampoo, I was hooked after the first washing. I love the scent and the way it feels on my scalp when I shower. Every now and then I will try a new shampoo and or conditioner as a change or on the recommendation of my hair stylist, at the end of each bottle I always come back to Ice Cap. I&#x27;m at the age most of my friends are losing their hair or thiers is thinning and looking brittle. It might be good genetics or it might be good care, but my hair is still full and soft, and my wife still enjoys running her hands through my hair. I&#x27;ve also let friends and family use the shampoo when they stay overnight at my house. They&#x27;ve all enjoyed the scent, refreshing feel, and the way their hair feels after it&#x27;s dried. I just wish I could get refills on the bottle to make it more eco friendly instead of buying a new plastic bottle each time I run out. Oh and by the way, I&#x27;ve had multiple sinus surgeries and my nose doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to, but I can still enjoy Ice Cap&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> It was not as remember. I used this shampoo in the early 20&amp;#34;s . needs more menthol . Not as tingly as it was. Fix it, Mr. Webb!!</li>
    <li> Discovered Graham Webb Ice Cap after a friend recommended the line to treat my daughter&#x27;s fine, flyaway hair. I liked the results so much I use it now myself.

    <li> so glad to finally have this again.  not an easy find at all, so i was so pleased to find online</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and great product</li>
    <li> It has been a while since I used the Ice Cap.  I was so excited to find it again.  I love the way it makes my hair and head feel while shampooing and dry.</li>
    <li> High quality cooling, refreshing, and moisturizing shampoo. A little pricey, but consider it a selfish pleasure. You&#x27;ve earned it. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> See conditioner review - same product.  My husband follows up with Ice Cap conditioner to moisturize his scalp which is key to scalp health thus controlling dry scalp</li>
    <li> Works well.  I was hoping the menthol effect would help nerve pain in my scalp, but it is not potent enough to do that.  However, that is not the intention of the product either.  As a shampoo, it does give you a bit of that fresh feeling due to the menthol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos trying to get my scalp to tingle and this is the only one that even comes close.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a long lasting scent in my hair.  I would recommend they add a peppermint scent and then it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Felt fortunate to find my favorite shampoo I&#x27;m sure it was luck.  I was in the process of trying to find another shampoo and got lucky just for looking for Ice Cap one more time.  Many Thanks to the Seller</li>
