    <li> Beautiful fragrance and great shipping.  Large size bottle.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Delicious, has actual depth. I was surprised because I was a little prejudiced against the name of the brand.... thought it would be too flowery. But it&#x27;s wonderful, long lasting and has many layers.</li>

    <li> Love the smell not to sweet not too floral perfect mix. Sophistication and classy feminine is how I describe this</li>
    <li> I used to use this perfume about two years ago and I missed it, so I decided to buy it again. But didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money at Macys where I usually buy my fragrances so I went with amazon. The fact that I only payed $21 for it was the best part but also, this perfume is the real version and it stays on all day long. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This perfume is a fresh clean scent that stays on for 24 hrs. I could still smell it after I woke up in the morning</li>
    <li> The perfume is watered down. It smells for only 5 seconds.  How sad.  What a waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  You can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere.</li>

    <li> I have been wearing this for years. It&#x27;s literally &amp;#34;my scent&amp;#34; from everyone I know. Thank Goodness I can order this through Amazon b/c they don&#x27;t sell it anywhere around me! It&#x27;s a great everyday scent not heavy very clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Love love love!! I&#x27;ve been wearing this for over a yr &amp; I still get compliments. Definitely would recommend this product</li>
    <li> This was NOT the real thing.</li>
