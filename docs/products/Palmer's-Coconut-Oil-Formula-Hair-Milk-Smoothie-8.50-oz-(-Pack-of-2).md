      <li>and the reason I love love love love love love</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>This works better than any detangler.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff, it&#x27;s a staple in my hair care.</li>
      <li>I think it would be even better if they could come up with a spray on version of this.  </li>
      <li>Perfect daily moisturizer for my hair type.</li>
      <li>After witnessing that even the best of salon products don&#x27;t fully moisturize my hair, my stylist suggested that I try some of the products intended for women with a very different texture hair than I have.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs very quickly &amp; smells great (very coconutty).</li>
      <li>Smells pretty good too and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>This product is wonderful if you have dry or frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Great for natural hair.  </li>
      <li>The hair can then be styled as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many FABULOUS attributes of this hair</li>
      <li>This is GREAT for my daughters natural hair.  </li>
      <li>I will apply some kind do oil to my hair first then apply the hair milk to see if it curbs the hardness and dryness.</li>
      <li>However, this does a fantastic job and is paraben-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a fantastic leave in conditioner/</li>
      <li>but it is a light lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep it and use it occasionally, but it&#x27;s not all that great.</li>
      <li>I tried many times just to be fair, but the results were just the same.</li>
      <li>i bout it at target for the same price, and it works amazing!</li>
      <li>The scent is light and not bad either.  </li>
      <li>shipping was fine came on time and packaged well, just not the right product for us.</li>
      <li>This smells like sweet coconut and something I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.</li>
      <li>I would recommend using the real coconut oil, it&#x27;ll do a much better job.</li>
      <li>Even when they promised to protect while using hot instruments, my hair never felt soft or looked good.  </li>
      <li>I have finally learned that my hair needs moisture, tons of it!&lt;br /&gt;Almost magically, when I use the Palmer&#x27;s Coconut Oil Formula (or their Olive Oil Formula), my hair straightens beautifully, shines and moves fluidly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other natural hair products but Palmer&#x27;s Coconut Oil Hair Milk works the best for me.</li>
      <li>have tried just about every product there is, ranging from very expensive salon products to cheap drugstore products, and am still on the search for what will work best for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I tried this hair milk formula on clean, damp hair and upon contact my hair was very soft and felt moisturized.</li>
      <li>&amp; I probably wouldn&#x27;t have to use as much hair milk if I used the shampoo &amp; conditioner first.</li>
      <li>I love this product, I put it on after I shampoo my hair, then blow dry, and since I have been using this product, My hair feels much fuller.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>He can never have too much moisture</li>
      <li>and it really helps.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very curly, wavy, frizzy &amp; color damaged.</li>
      <li>I am very much satisfied with the product and will continue to use it as my go-to daily moisturizer for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>she gets a nice wave that stays for a few days.  </li>
      <li>My hair tangles easily and the ends of my hair tend to be dry and the humidity will frizz my hair.  </li>
      <li>If it is applied evenly, it does a decent job of smoothing &amp;#34;friizies.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>The main ingredients in this is water, shea butter and silicones (which help to stretch and straighten the hair allowing detangling).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I was not aware of the added stabilizers in the product.&lt;br /&gt;VO5 or jojoba oil works far better to moisturize hair.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
      <li>So far this works really well.</li>
      <li>It offers decent definition and hold, and lots of moisture.</li>
      <li>I like to wear my hair natural with all of it&#x27;s curls, twists, and kinks from full volume to low key body but</li>
      <li>The coconut smell definitely smells real, not like an</li>
      <li>If I leave it curly, it feels soft and doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy</li>
      <li>But I never felt my hair or marley hair (the weave I use) feel this soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product on my relaxed hair and now that I&#x27;ve gone natural</li>
      <li>The manageability increased 100 fold and so soft.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like the natural oils that your hair produces.  </li>
      <li>it makes my waist length hair much easier to brush when I get out of the shower, and also makes my hair less prone to tangling in the first place.</li>
      <li>also love the fact that Palmer&#x27;s Does Not Support Animal Testing (!) and doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune.</li>
      <li>In my family we have all different hair types from thick &amp; curly, to fine &amp; straight.</li>
      <li>Their looks pretty rough in the morning but this and a lil water livens them up.</li>
      <li>Coconut Oil Hair Milk is made with pure coconut milk and vitamin E, and can be used on either dry hair or damp hair (I&#x27;ve tried it on both!).  </li>
      <li>To make matters worse, it is naturally wavy and very fine, so FRIZZ is a battle I fight on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found is that this product can weigh down fine hair, making it look very flat.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and touchable, and no build up the next day!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 4b natural and I am such a fan of protective styling.</li>
      <li>My extraordinarily damaged hair-- which has received a quintuple whammy of poor nutrition, genetics, coloring, overexposure to hot water daily, and overuse of the ponytail-- is very dry and very brittle.  </li>
      <li>I use a lot for my son&#x27;s thick &amp; curly hair, slightly less for my other son&#x27;s finer, curly hair and just a little bit for my fine, straight hair (mostly to control my frizz).</li>
      <li>I normally use it after i towel dry my hair.</li>
      <li>We use this on my little girls very, very curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It is very inexpensive when compared to other such products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am Caucasian and my hair is naturally curly and long.  </li>
      <li>never flat!  </li>
      <li>This hair milk puts back the moisture and softness into your hair without weighing it down too much.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This did not do well in my hair or my daughters. shipping was fine came on time and packaged well, just not the right product for us.</li>
    <li> The main ingredients in this is water, shea butter and silicones (which help to stretch and straighten the hair allowing detangling). The smell is great and it doesn&#x27;t break my hair off which is great. The only problem is that my hair looks dull and slimy after it dries in my hair... It also makes my head ache. I&#x27;ll keep it and use it occasionally, but it&#x27;s not all that great.</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair.  My daughter has long unrelaxed hair.  If I put this in and cornrow it she gets a nice wave that stays for a few days.  Nice smelling too!</li>
    <li> This is a really great moisturizing product. In my family we have all different hair types from thick &amp; curly, to fine &amp; straight. I use a lot for my son&#x27;s thick &amp; curly hair, slightly less for my other son&#x27;s finer, curly hair and just a little bit for my fine, straight hair (mostly to control my frizz). My husband also uses. His hair would be thick &amp; curly, but he keeps it very short, so he only uses a little to moisturize his hair &amp; scalp. It absorbs very quickly &amp; smells great (very coconutty). I want to try the shampoo &amp; conditioner next, especially for my son w/the thick,curly hair. He can never have too much moisture &amp; I probably wouldn&#x27;t have to use as much hair milk if I used the shampoo &amp; conditioner first.</li>
    <li> I was not sure how the coconut oil formula was going to work but my hair got stronger, thicker, and longer.  The manageability increased 100 fold and so soft.  I like to wear my hair natural with all of it&#x27;s curls, twists, and kinks from full volume to low key body but never flat!  Since I do not color my hair and I do not use chemicals it is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t dry out my hair, I live in a desert next to the ocean, or make my hair look like I have dandruff.  Incredible feel and great smell.  I can hardly wait until my next order comes in.  A must have for curly haired, mixed chick, or tight curled coiffs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of leave in conditioning products.  Either they are too oily or not moisturizing enough for me.  I am Caucasian and my hair is naturally curly and long.  My hair tangles easily and the ends of my hair tend to be dry and the humidity will frizz my hair.  This product helps my hair look normal without being overly greasy and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it builds up like other products.  The scent is light and not bad either.  This hair milk puts back the moisture and softness into your hair without weighing it down too much.  It&#x27;s just like the natural oils that your hair produces.  I think it would be even better if they could come up with a spray on version of this.  I thought it was a spray when I ordered, it but it is a light lotion.</li>
    <li> With age, comes wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;I used to battle my dry, wavy hair with all sorts of products that promised control and manageability, but instead left my hair a dry, course mess.  Even when they promised to protect while using hot instruments, my hair never felt soft or looked good.  I have finally learned that my hair needs moisture, tons of it!&lt;br /&gt;Almost magically, when I use the Palmer&#x27;s Coconut Oil Formula (or their Olive Oil Formula), my hair straightens beautifully, shines and moves fluidly.  If I leave it curly, it feels soft and doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that Palmer&#x27;s Does Not Support Animal Testing (!) and doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for hair.  Left a film.  Nice to use on legs and even moisturizer for legs.  I was not aware of the added stabilizers in the product.&lt;br /&gt;VO5 or jojoba oil works far better to moisturize hair.&lt;br /&gt;Let buyer beware...</li>
    <li> Love love love works great on all types of hair !!!</li>
    <li> Is a great leave in conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and touchable, and no build up the next day!</li>
    <li> This smells like sweet coconut and something I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on. It&#x27;s a delicious, tropical smell, perfect for summer. It&#x27;s also a fantastic leave in conditioner/detangler- it makes my waist length hair much easier to brush when I get out of the shower, and also makes my hair less prone to tangling in the first place. Love this stuff, it&#x27;s a staple in my hair care.</li>
    <li> I tried this product but wasn&#x27;t impressed at all...it has a weird smell and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel any improvement after using it. I tried many times just to be fair, but the results were just the same. I would recommend using the real coconut oil, it&#x27;ll do a much better job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of Black, American Indian &amp; Cuban descent. My hair texture is 3b &amp; 3c. It&#x27;s very curly, wavy, frizzy &amp; color damaged. I&#x27;ve tried other natural hair products but Palmer&#x27;s Coconut Oil Hair Milk works the best for me. It leaves my hair moisturized &amp; shiny. I use it on wet or dry hair. It works well with all of my styles...twist &amp; braid outs, blow outs, roller sets, air dried curls etc. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year &amp; I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Perfect daily moisturizer for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my relaxed hair and now that I&#x27;ve gone natural I&#x27;ve continued using it. It keeps my hair hydrated and moisturized.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried every type of conditioner and detangler for my daughter&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s thick and straight but tangles terribly everyday.  This works better than any detangler.  I put it in before I use her hair genie brush (another amazing product) and it really helps.  I have tried other shea butter creams and they left her hair greasy. This one leaves her hair smooth and it smells great, but no greasy appearance.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hair was very dry from the summer sun and this restored the moisture.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with shea butter i make into hair oil. And find that this coconut Oil works great on frizzy hair  and smells great. Not alot is needed either.</li>
    <li> this was great! i bout it at target for the same price, and it works amazing! it makes your hair smell great like coconuts! and it smooths it out</li>
    <li> My extraordinarily damaged hair-- which has received a quintuple whammy of poor nutrition, genetics, coloring, overexposure to hot water daily, and overuse of the ponytail-- is very dry and very brittle.  To make matters worse, it is naturally wavy and very fine, so FRIZZ is a battle I fight on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just about every product there is, ranging from very expensive salon products to cheap drugstore products, and am still on the search for what will work best for my hair.  After witnessing that even the best of salon products don&#x27;t fully moisturize my hair, my stylist suggested that I try some of the products intended for women with a very different texture hair than I have.  Her salon doesn&#x27;t sell such products, so I wound up in the haircare aisle at a local bigbox store, where I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palmer&#x27;s Coconut Oil Hair Milk is made with pure coconut milk and vitamin E, and can be used on either dry hair or damp hair (I&#x27;ve tried it on both!).  Just rub a small amount (I use a dollup the size of a nickel on my shoulder-blade-length hair) between the palms and then rub into the hair.  The hair can then be styled as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many FABULOUS attributes of this hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It smells DELICIOUS!  The coconut smell definitely smells real, not like an artificial, overly-sweet, lab-created scent.&lt;br /&gt;2) It does smooth the hair fairly well.  If it is applied evenly, it does a decent job of smoothing &amp;#34;friizies.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling in the hands after rubbing it into hair.&lt;br /&gt;4) It does soften hair.&lt;br /&gt;5) It is very inexpensive when compared to other such products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found is that this product can weigh down fine hair, making it look very flat.</li>
    <li> Smells like wd-40. Which isn&#x27;t a terrible smell but some may not want to smell like that. My three sons use it 1,7,8 y/o.  Their looks pretty rough in the morning but this and a lil water livens them up.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this stuff. I usually use Carol&#x27;s Daughter Hair Milk on my 3b curls. However, this does a fantastic job and is paraben- and sulfate-free! Score! Not to mention its a quarter of the price of Carol&#x27;s Daughter products It offers decent definition and hold, and lots of moisture. I use this and then seal my hair with a serum and gel and it looks great. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the worse think I have ever put in my hair. never again. wish I would have never heard about it.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT for my daughters natural hair.  It defined her right curls and smells WONDERFUL!  I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> great item bought for my daughters hair and was amazed with the results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten soo many people hooked to this it&#x27;s the best leave-in /mouse /gel /conditioner anyone could ever want any hair-type any ethnicity!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 4b natural and I am such a fan of protective styling. For the last two months I had my hair in twists and I used hair milk daily sometimes twice a day sometimes every other day my routine isn&#x27;t rigid lol. But I never felt my hair or marley hair (the weave I use) feel this soft and hydrated. My hair has amazing shine and when I took out my twist my curls had snap to them. and the reason I love love love love love love there was absolutely NO BREAKAGE!!!!!!! the ultimate compliment. I love palmers skin products but now their hair products have a permanent spot in my bathroom closet as well...recommending it to strangers on the street its definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I use it in my hair daily instead of styling gel or other product and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> We use this on my little girls very, very curly hair.  We use it as a leave in conditioner and it works great.  It has the added bonus of smelling great as well.</li>
    <li> I have used Palmer&#x27;s Coconut Oil Formula Replenishing Hair Milk now for over a year.  I am very much satisfied with the product and will continue to use it as my go-to daily moisturizer for my natural hair. I use it to refresh my curly fro when I don&#x27;t want to do my daily co-wash routine.  Please note: My hair type is 3C/4A; it has a definite curly pattern.</li>
    <li> I tried this hair milk formula on clean, damp hair and upon contact my hair was very soft and felt moisturized. But, as my hair air-dried it became very dry and crunchy which I didn&#x27;t like. I will apply some kind do oil to my hair first then apply the hair milk to see if it curbs the hardness and dryness.</li>
    <li> So far this works really well. Smells pretty good too and not greasy.  I normally use it after i towel dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Gives a smoothe feel to my hair. Use it all the time. Would definitely recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful if you have dry or frizzy hair. Great for curly hair--strengthens it also and gives it shine.</li>
    <li> Shinning the hair after wash, then it is not frizzier during winter time.  It is smell good too.  Great product</li>
    <li> My family is from the tropics and with our thick hair, we need a little extra something to condition it, keep it healthy - especially if we use curling or straightening irons regularly.  This formula is just like the homemade stuff sans all the hard work.  ^._^</li>
    <li> Great stuff...smells great and keeps hair groomed and looking good!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I put it on after I shampoo my hair, then blow dry, and since I have been using this product, My hair feels much fuller.</li>
    <li> I will definitely purchase again.</li>
