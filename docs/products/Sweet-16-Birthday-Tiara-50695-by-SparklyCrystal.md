      <li>but the fit was not all that t.</li>
      <li>She isn&#x27;t the girliest of girls, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how she&#x27;d like it, but she really did love it and still has it.  </li>
      <li>Very sparkly!!!</li>
      <li>The 16 is hanging prettily :)</li>
      <li>I purchased this item for my daughters sweet 16 birthday.</li>
      <li>My daughter was a princess on her Sweet 16.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughters sweet 16 party, she felt like a princess wearing it.</li>
      <li>I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t sparkle very much and that it wouldn&#x27;t fit the person I was buying for.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, just as pictured</li>
      <li>It was food quality and very pretty.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughters sweet 16 birthday, and we both love it because the crystals are clear and sparkly.</li>
      <li>Nice Sweet 16 gift for my teenage niece.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to keep on, even for straight silky hair.</li>
      <li>So pretty and sweet</li>
      <li>&quot; She put it on right away, &amp; didn&#x27;t take it off the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>First I like to thank all the other&#x27;s for leaving feed back as it truly decides whether I buy or not an item, This princess crown is BEAUTIFUL!</li>
      <li>whole concept was Princess that day!</li>
      <li>For the reasonable price - no complaints!</li>
      <li>It was so pretty</li>
      <li>Great quality, expensive looking piece, and light weight.</li>
      <li>My Daughter wore this on at least 3 different occasions during the week of her Sweet Sixteen birthday - she absolutely loved it!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look cheap; just the right size for teen head (not baby sized)</li>
      <li>I was afraid that the tiara would be cheaply made, but it was gorgeous!</li>
      <li>My daughter looked gorgeous wearing this small crown for her 16th birthday.</li>
      <li>My daughter felt like a real princess with this crown on at her 16th birthday party.</li>
      <li>This item is very bling and defiantly a keepsake of the celebration.</li>
      <li>The tiara was specifically meant  to the &amp;#34;cr owning event&#x27; of our granddaughter&#x27;s 16th birthday celebration, and it really served its purpose.  </li>
      <li>and it is a &amp;#34;dangle&amp;#34; and it keep turning or getting stuck in her hair so the 16 really wasn&#x27;t all that visible much of the time while she was wearing it.</li>
      <li>It was at the bottom of the monogrammed gift sack I gave her (filled with monogrammed notecards, foil envelope seals, trinket box, note pad, &amp; a magnet, all with her gold foil initial!)</li>
      <li>I purchased this Tiara and received more than I had expected.</li>
      <li>Our Party is that day,  so we super glued it back on.  </li>
      <li>Would highly suggest to purchase if you are considering it.</li>
      <li>I looked high quality and sparkled each time she moved.  </li>
      <li>The pink &amp; clear crystals just reflected every bit of light in the room.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SHE THOUGHT THE 16 IN THE CENTER WAS COOL AND SHE</li>
      <li>I think it made her feel extra special on her big day.</li>
      <li>Other than that it is very pretty</li>
      <li>There is a 16 in the middle of the crown on the picture, which is why I bought the crown for my daughter&#x27;s sweet sixteen party, but the actual crown has nothing but a BIG HOLE where the 16 should be.  </li>
      <li>She looked at my sister, and whispered, \\&quot;Nana, it&#x27;s got a little 16 right in front.\\</li>

It was wonderful!</li>

Other than that it is very pretty and my daughter can&#x27;t wait to wear it on her bday!</li>
