    <li> This is a must have if you have natural hair. It makes your hair so smooth and soft and manageable. Without this I couldn&#x27;t get a comb even halfway through my hair before it broke the comb, got too tangled or just plain ripped hair out of my head. My hair feels like hair and not hay. I don&#x27;t know how I even managed without this product for so long.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for in a daily hair care product.</li>
    <li> I have decided to stop relaxing my hair and go natural and this product works great for my natural hair, which I believe to be 4c maybe with some 4b in there.  I use this product about 4 times a week and then I seal in the moisture with an oil like castor oil or avocado oil.  Even after using this once for the week my hair still remains really soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fine-haired curly, low to medium density, type 4a/4b/3c.  I use this moisturizer as the cream part of my nighttime LOC (liquid, oil, cream) regimen.  It has a wonderful scent, is neither too heavy nor too thin, and a little bit goes a long way.  I wash my hair roughly every three to four days, and this lotion keeps it moisturized from wash day to wash day.  An added bonus is that it also detangles.  Good bargain for the price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does!!! There are no harsh chemicals in this product as stated right on the bottle! I am AA It moisturizes my hair and makes it extremely soft and it smells tropical! My hair loves it! I will now add this to my hair care regimen!</li>
    <li> I love this hair lotion. It leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized without leaving a film like some other hair lotions did. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s being sold for so much on here. I purchased mine from Walgreens for 7.99, then I saw it in Target for 5.99. You can definitely find it cheaper elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly 3b/c. My hair is naturally soft, thin. I do color. This stuff feel great going on but after it dries my hair was stiff and slight coated. It re-activate well with water but once dry same thing. So in order to keep it from drying my hair out I put Black Castor OIl (mixed with jojoba) over it. I use just a little because your hair will be a oily mess.  This helps. Now I just used this on my edges and the tips of my hair because I have dry ends.  Once I use this up I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Cantu Shea butter hair lotion keeps my hair soft, shine, and moisturized. I love this product. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> it smells very good, leaves your hair soft and moisturized for days on end.  I will always use this.  Must check out some of their other products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you need extra moisture for your hair. It is a little too heavy for me but a great product. It smells good, the consistency is good with great moisting effects.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel, and the smell! Only thing is that it takes a while for it to soak in but otherwise, its great :)</li>
    <li> This product leaves my 3c/4a hair very soft and with a beautiful sheen! No crunch, no matter how much product I use although a little goes a long way! I have used this product several ways and each time has delivered great results. I initially bought it as a styler for my two strand twists. My twists stayed soft with a nice sheen all week. When I took my twist out I had a beautiful Twistout. Every time I use this product I get compliments on my hair. I&#x27;ve also used this product to moisturize my hair and it works excellent to control frizz. For the first time I&#x27;ve discovered a product that helped bring out the true beauty of my hair. I see curls I didn&#x27;t know I had! Recently I used it to finger detangle my hair and it broke down those tangles with so much ease. This has definitely become a staple for me. I love it!! Love, love, love this product! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff ! Very moisturizing. It also works really well on my daugter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Product was not good for my loc.</li>

    <li> I have extremely dry thick hair. I&#x27;ve been searching for a moisturizer that will keep my hair truly moisturized for the entire day. This hair lotion works so great!! I love it. And it smells so good.</li>
    <li> OM to the G I was looking for a hair product that I can use that will not make my hair feel or look heavy, and I have found it. the Cantu product smell and makes my hair so soft. excellent product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell that much. Left my hair a little white for a bit and then the normal color came back</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling silky and moist.</li>
    <li> I did not buy mine from amazon but from a local hair store and wanted to review anyways.. I had seen a lot of reviews on youtube and have been natural on and off for 10 years and not really knowing why my hair grows so slow and what products to use. I was good on shampoos and conditioners and oils as well.. but I was still using hair grease.. I finally decided to find a moisturizer that would work like hair grease but better.. THIS IS IT !! The first night I did a twist out and the next morning before untwisting I could feel how soft and moist my hair was.. I fell in love and so did my husband son and daughter LOL. I recommend this product because I have short fine thin hair and it has been doin wonder keeping my hair moisturized all day. It doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals, oils, or silicones and has al the right ingredients for natural hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps my hair looking moisturized and smelling great all day. Would highly recomend.</li>
