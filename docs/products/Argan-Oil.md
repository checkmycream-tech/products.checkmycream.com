<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for dry winter time skin!</li>
    <li> My hands are so soft after using this!</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil!  This brand does not have that musty smell that some brands have.  I like the fact that you can use it on your face, your cuticles, your split ends, dry heels -everything!</li>
    <li> I posted this review on March 2nd and somehow it&#x27;s disappeared so I&#x27;m writing it again -- I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Argan Oil for awhile now. This product arrived in a timely manner, undamaged and in professional packaging. I have thick, curly hair that gets frizzy very fast. I typically have to use a few different products on my hair while it&#x27;s wet in order for my hair to stay manageable throughout the day. Instead of using any product on my hair, I let it dry naturally then I applied the oil only on my hair. I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy. I was also surprised that a little really went a long way. My hair was soft and didn&#x27;t frizz all day long. My brother came over and saw it and tried a couple of drops on his beard and he really liked it. I added a couple of drops extra for my hands and face over my moisturizer and realized that I have found my new favorite beauty product. This oil works wonders and I&#x27;m excited to use something so natural, with so many vitamins. I&#x27;m done with all the chemical hair products, this is what I&#x27;m using from now on.  I received this product at a discount for review.  I don&#x27;t always purchase products at a discount.  Only ones I&#x27;m really interested in.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is one of my favorite oils I have come across. This one works great and is a Moroccan Argan Oil. I have used it in my after a shower to give it a little extra condition and help smooth those fly away hairs. I also tried this on my nails; as I have to admit I am a nail bitter and trying to grow out my nails to help strengthen them. I am happy to report that they appear to be growing out a little thicker than before. You can also use it to moisturize your skin which is a favorite usage of mine. I put it on my dry patches and usually within a day a two those dreadful patches begin to decrease in roughness and size; but remember to keep using it to get the full effects. The first time I tried it I was expecting a miracle in minutes, but like everything good things come to those who are patient; so make sure to follow the directions of usage. I have told friends and family of this wonderful oil, I just love it! Another great thing about this oil is it have a light scent which dissipates quickly, not greasy to touch or use, and a little goes a long way. Also, it leaves your skin shiny and smooth to the touch!&lt;br /&gt;I received this oil in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> There are quite a number of brands of Argan Oil on the market today, but there are some better than others. I believe that this Odara Virgin Argon Oil is one of the best. This Moroccan Argan Oil is 100% organic and I love using this Argan oil for my hair. It effectively detangles my hair after I shampoo and I even use it in between shampoos to keep the frizzies away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Virgin Argan Oil is also great to use on the skin (especially face) and nails. I rub some on my cuticles a couple times a week and it really helps keep them soft. This oil is like a natural moisturizer and conditioner. I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I highly recommend this Odara Virgin Argan Oil for anyone that need a great moisturizer for their skin and also wants to bring shine to their hair. Fantastic Product!</li>
    <li> This Odara Virgin Argan Oil is truly amazing and doing wonders for my cracked skin hands. I have never tried Argan oil before but then I was given the opportunity to try this product so that I can provide my feedback and honest opinion. I really like that it comes with a doppler so I get just the right amount that I need and the oil doesn&#x27;t get all over. My hands were so cracked and after using the Moroccon oil a couple of times a day for a couple of days my hands are so soft and it&#x27;s like I never had a problem with my skin. Just a couple drops is all I need so the oil will last me a long time. I love that it is not greasy but still gives a shine to my hands.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using this oil on my lower legs as this cold winter has dried them out tremendously.  I know that when I go and get a pedicure, the workers first put oil, then lotion on my legs, and they always feel so smooth and soft afterwards.  So, I started to do the same at home.  I was worried about feeling and looking extra greasy, but this oil rubs in really well.  I was also afraid of my clothes and bed sheets becoming greasy (as I apply in the morning and at night), but so far, they aren’t.  I will continue to use this product for a few more weeks, and hopefully, come time for shorts weather, my legs will be thoroughly hydrated!  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
    <li> I love the Argan Oil.  It is amazing at taking the frizz away from my hair.  It takes very little to achieve this also.  The first time I used it I put on a little too much.  The next time I used a smaller amount and it was perfect.  I also have been using it on my daughters dry scalp and has done wonders for her scalp.  No more dryness.  I also rub it on my hands and it has helped to keep them moisturized in this dry December Texas air.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Great product, quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Odara Pure Naturals is a wonderful company that makes a quality product. When I was selected to win a complementary sample of Odara Pure Naturals Argan Oil during a promotion they were having I was absolutely thrilled. All I need to do is test their product and report my results here in this review. This Argan oil is amazing! There are so many ways to use it! I use it on my face, hair and nails and it works beautifully. My hair is soft again, not brittle because I color it. It has a lovely shine and feels hydrated again. And it isn&#x27;t greasy at all and has a lovely shine. It also gives my face wonderful hydration during these dry winter months and my hands and nails have never looked better! I am definitely hooked on this Argan oil, it is really a wonderful, versatile product that everyone can use. All statements made in this review are solely my own personal experience while using Odara Pure Naturals Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> I have recently discovered Argan Oil and don&#x27;t know how I went so many years without it.  There are so many uses and when I was given this Odara brand to test for quality, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  It is winter here in Indiana and here are the two ways I use this oil every day.  First of all, I put it around my cuticles and on my hands at night.  I am a manager at a hospital and wash my hands about 30 times a day.  My skin pay the price.  I find that if I apply this oil liberally at night and put on cotton gloves, my skin is soft and the cracks begin to heal.  Remember, this is an oil and could stain your bed linens, hence the wearing of the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, my hair is a frizzy mess after blow drying it.  I put a few drops of this oil on and hands and run them through my hair to tame it down.  I have also used it directly on my scalp when it gets dry as well.  If you have not experienced the pleasures of Argan oil, now is the time.</li>
    <li> Not sure, did help some acne and scarring on my teen daughters back but didn&#x27;t help it all go away.  Good product for hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Argan Oil. It does wonders for my hair, skin and nails. It detangles my hair while leaving silky soft. I have not been able to find another product to have the same results.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister to use in her hair and she absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> This is my go to Argan oil. I will reach for this one before bed and wake up fresh faced every time. It is 100% Argan so of course there is the nutty smell. I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil as it soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy on my skin. The bottle is in dropper form, so its very easy to use. I bought this at a discounted price to give my complete and honest review. *UPDATE* if you DO notice a strange smell in your bottle, please ask to have it replaced as this actually DOES have a tiny bit of an off odor, it isn&#x27;t anything serious tho, I don&#x27;t mind it one bit. Still love the effect it leaves on my skin tho .</li>
    <li> Yes, the product was received and quite quickly as well.  I have used argan oil before and this seems to work very well.  I have used it on my face and hands and have been quite happy.  I have not yet used it on my hair, which is what I have typically used this type of oil for.  I look forward to using it more to see how well it does over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it on my hair and it was great - softest ever!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonderful. It keeps my skin moisturized and feeling great</li>
    <li> Love this product!! My curls look amazing...perfect ringlets and no frizz!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great I use it on my split ends, dry cuticals and face.  Definatly works</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My hair is already smoother</li>
    <li> I love using this oil for my hair and scalp. It does not feel greasy and does not clog my pores. My hair feels silky and strong. I put some on before I blow dry my hair as a protectant as well. I am probably going to run out fast since I am using it so much. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have had a chance to use the Virgin Argan Oil. I have been using it on a dry rash on my neck. I can see great improvement. I also use it on my fingernails and love how it makes my nails feel and look. I am looking forward in using it next on my color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am very please with your product!!</li>
    <li> 100% all natural; pure. Perfect. No smell whatsoever. I have curly, coarse , thick hair. My hairdresser recommended Argan Oil for me. I had been using a spray she was using that I bought at a bog box store - I tossed it. ODARA ARGAN OIL has one ingredient - Argan Oil. The spray? At least 10 ingredients;  Argan Oil was 5th on the list. When my hair is wet I take several drops, place them on my scalp and  near my brow line. I comb it through evenly. I also put a bit in my hands to saturate the ends of my hair. My curls are more defined and my hair is softer. There is a visible difference if I forget to use argan oil in the mornings. Argan oil reduces frizz and keeps my curls at bay. I have not used this on my skin, so I cannot attest to its effectiveness as far as skin care. I know it works on my hair. I have tried several brands of argan oil, as this is what really works for my hair. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product and it does not disappoint. All natural, fresh, and it works. A win win for curly girls.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a hair remedy, this is what you need!! This is one of my favorite oils &amp; definitely a go too! My stylist says she can&#x27;t believe how great of shape my hair is in after all the bleaching and heat I put it through in such a short amount of time, &amp; its definitely due to all my oil treatments! Sometimes I heat the oil up, other times I&#x27;m too lazy &amp; just apply it as is, or other times I will make my own hair mask &amp; mix it with other oils, then put a shower cap on &amp; leave it be for a few hours, or overnight if I feel like it &amp; let the heat of my scalp do its magic! You can also use a drop or two of this wonderful argan oil on your mid-shaft to ends after you get out of the shower as a leave in. As long as you don&#x27;t use too much of it, it will soak into your hair &amp; wont leave you greasy!It is a pleasure to review this Argan Oil and share my honest opinions a nice hair mask butter recipe: 1/2 cup solid coconut oil,1/2 cup of shea butter, 2 to 5 tbsp argan oil. Then use a hand mixer to combine &amp; whip, store in airtight container.</li>
    <li> Virgin Argan Oil! I have heard a lot of buzz for a few years about the benifits of this oil…. With the cold weather approaching and the fact that my skin tends to dry out. I decided it was time to give it a try.. Now I can see the benefits in multitude. It can be used for so many different things. My hair providing a wonderful lustier and fullness of body. Dry hands, no longer a problem… I also massage it into my skin after showering and use on my feet its an overall wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Got this after smelling another brand at the local health store that had an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell. This Argan oil does not! It has a very light, pleasant smell, that is almost not there. I have bad rosacea and was hoping to find something that would help combat a side-effect of the medicine I use - a very tight and scaly face. This has worked wonders. I use it in the morning and at night - in the morning after putting on the medication, and my skin INSTANTLY feels smooth and so much less tight. At night I use it after taking off my makeup - it is not oily at all! I love the fact it has a dropper, so there is no waste, I just use 3 or 4 drops. Very, very happy with this product, can&#x27;t say enough!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product, love my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, I am very happy with the quality!</li>
    <li> It comes in a 2Fl Oz bottle. Which is quite a bit of product. I love this virgin oil for many reasons. It works great if you have a dry scalp, its light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave that oily residue like other oils do. I also use it as a face moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t break me out like other products. To me it also doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Which I have tried alot of other argan oils and they all seem to have a bad smell to me. I was relieved when I found out it really doesn&#x27;t smell. It also helps me with my fly away hairs. It has so many uses. This has been the best argan virgin oil thus far!! I have received this Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil at a discount in return for my honest opinion on this product. My review is my opinion.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law uses all organic and natural products...she was excited to receive this product...she loves the way her skin and hair feel</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use in my hair &amp; oil mixes for facial oil &amp; body oil.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Argan Oil and I like it! My hair has been really dry lately but I have noticed that it is becoming much healthier and silkier feeling since using. I&#x27;ve even noticed my scalp hasn&#x27;t been as dry and itchy lately. After washing my hair I rub a few drops in my palms then throughout my hair and on my scalp. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my hands and nails and they are much softer and smoother. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of it but after reading up on this I found out none of them really smell that great. It&#x27;s not horrible but would be so much better in maybe a citrus or flowery scent... but that&#x27;s just my preference. I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I am glad I did because my dry scalp, hair, and hands are all feeling so much silkier!! I really like that they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee!! I look forward to trying it for some of the many other uses it is recommended for such as: bags under the eyes, wrinkles, smile lines and many more.</li>
    <li> i love using this in my hair when it starts to feel a bit dry. a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I found this was of great quality and it smells really pleasant. It&#x27;s been working great at keeping my hands from drying out-- which is always a big problem for me in the winter. I would absolutely buy again.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair and skin feeling amazing!</li>
