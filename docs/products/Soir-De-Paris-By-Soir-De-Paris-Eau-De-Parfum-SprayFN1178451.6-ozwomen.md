      <li>Gave it to someone who liked it so it all worked out in the end.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled when I saw that Amazon had a perfume that was on the market in the 1930 Depression Era.  </li>
      <li>The perfume stopped being made in the U.S. in 1969, so I am thrilled that I can get it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Used it as a teenager and liked it then, but not now.</li>
      <li>It is a nice smell at any rate.</li>
      <li>I understand why this was so popular in the 40&#x27;s &amp; 50&#x27;s.  </li>

      <li>It does not however smell like &amp;#34;Evening in Paris.&amp;#34; I love it though.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and I am using it all my life</li>
      <li>I feel Soir de Paris is already more obsolete than Evening in Paris.</li>

      <li>I used to buy it 30 years ago or more</li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Although this formula differs in scent from when my mother wore it in the 1950s, it is still lovely</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not what I remembered it being many years ago.  </li>

      <li>It was available in many stores at that time.  </li>
      <li>She had used it many years ago and didn&#x27;t know it was still available.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was more available.</li>
      <li>My husband said he likes the original version much better.</li>
      <li>Overheard her talking about the original one at a party and how she would love to find it again.</li>
      <li>scent is very light and a touch of sweet.  </li>
      <li>and I consider myself very lucky.</li>
      <li>This is one of those fragrances that is easy to &amp;#34;over</li>
      <li>I am happy I did because it brings back lovely memories.  </li>
      <li>The lady I purchased this for said it was not as strongly scented as Evening</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The fragrance was ok But by no means anywhere close to the true Evening in Paris scent.</li>
      <li>so I did not open the package, but it was attractive and looked the way I thought it should have.  </li>
      <li>and I enjoy wearing it.</li>
      <li>If you can find a real bottle, it smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is soft and has good staying on power.</li>
      <li>Even when my 6 year old daughter doused her teddy bear, we all loved the scent.  </li>
      <li>and she was so excited to have it.</li>
      <li>Never knew it was from France originally.  </li>
      <li>This perfume is an adaption of original Evening in Paris from 40 years ago.</li>
      <li>agreed this was not even close to the original .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice light fragrance and it&#x27;s such a thrill to be able to have it shipped to Canada.  </li>

      <li>While it does not smell like the original, it is close.</li>
      <li>I bought an original bottle with the tassel on ebay and transferred the perfume into it.</li>
      <li>the original is no longer made so after researching</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was a joy receiving my Soir De Paris (Evening in Paris) perfume so quickly. This lovely bottle and scent brought back my early memories of the elegant times it represented. Do yourself a favor and step into the misty blue past, well fortified with this Bourjois favorite - as you waltz by, leaving a whiff of romance.</li>
    <li> I use Soir De Paris as my daily scent and it works for me. My brother first sent me a bottle of Evening in Paris when I was about 13 and today&#x27;s fragrance is just as I remember.</li>
    <li> This is one of those fragrances that is easy to &amp;#34;over do&amp;#34;.  Just a little or it will be overpowering.  The problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t really last all day either.  It is a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> originally I was so excited to find this because it had been my mothers favorite from years back.  I don&#x27;t know what this fragrence is but it is definitely NOT evening in Paris! Thank goodness I opened it to smell it before I gave it to my mom; however my mistake because now I cannot return it! Aweful!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I saw that Amazon had a perfume that was on the market in the 1930 Depression Era.  It was available in many stores at that time.  My mother wore it on special occasions and the scent lingers in my memory.  \\&quot;Evening In Paris\\&quot; or \\&quot;Soir De Paris\\&quot; made the last seventy years disappear.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The perfume is quite satisfatory.  However my wife thought this would be closer in aroma to the \\&quot;Evening in Paris\\&quot; that she remembered her mother using about 50 years ago.</li>
    <li> The lady I purchased this for said it was not as strongly scented as Evening In Paris so beware</li>
    <li> I ordered this procuct for my mother-in-law for Christmas. She had used it many years ago and didn&#x27;t know it was still available. She likes it but thinks that it used to smell different than this one she got. It is a nice smell at any rate.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife at Christmas. It arrived Jan.18 and my wife says it&#x27;s nothing like Evening In Paris. The looks of the bottle is very miss leading, making you think that your are getting the original aroma. But no way</li>
    <li> It met all our expectations, and revived memories of his first exposure. He remembers that I  wore it on 5 years of courtship during WW II. We had searched far &amp; wide.</li>
    <li> I understand why this was so popular in the 40&#x27;s &amp; 50&#x27;s.  It is such a heavenly scent.  My wife loved it!</li>
    <li> When I was a little girl my favorite aunt wore this fragrance I loved to hug her she smelled so lovely. It brings back loving memories of her now.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom who is 91.  My dad had got her some when they were young and she said it brings back good memories.</li>
    <li> I like Evening In Paris however for me the fragrance does not seem to last long.</li>
    <li> Remember this from my grand mother, Evening in Paris!</li>
    <li> Although this formula differs in scent from when my mother wore it in the 1950s, it is still lovely and I wear it every day.  I got what I ordered, when it was promised, for the price promised.</li>
    <li> The color of the bottle was cobalt, the same as years ago. But the bottle was very \\&quot;now.\\&quot;  The fragrance was VERY strong - not what I remembered.   All in all, okay.  Amazon is very good however. Came in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> This was to be a gift for a lady in her 80s--one of us who remembers \\&quot;Evening in Paris\\&quot; from the 50s or earlier--so I did not open the package, but it was attractive and looked the way I thought it should have.  I also wasn&#x27;t there when she opened the bottle, but was told later that this was the stuff.  I bought it from Perfume Station (through Amazon), and shipping was quick and excellent.  I would buy this again, and I would buy it from Perfume Station.</li>
    <li> Awful smell and no option to return&lt;br /&gt;Feel like I threw money out the window&lt;br /&gt;Never again no return no purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas as soon as she opened it she knew it was the smell of her favorite perfume back in the 50&#x27;s it  was a good buy with good memories for her it is not a over powering smell its a soft nostalgic sweet smell.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is soft and has good staying on power. It does not however smell like &amp;#34;Evening in Paris.&amp;#34; I love it though.</li>
    <li> Got this and is NOT the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this scent--it reminds me of my mother.</li>
    <li> I have used their products (including hair cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is exhilarating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone interested in evoking old memories.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this for the time I had it.  This parfum was a a birthday gift for someone else.  We had lots of Evening in Paris when we were kids so I brought this PARFUM for her.  When it arrived in two days after ordering it, I just had to have a little spritz.  I went to the meeting and wow everybody was friendly. However my friend took a big spray when I gave it to her and it was overpowering.  I may buy myself a bottle of this parfum.</li>
    <li> A blast from my past........I love this</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend because she used to buy it for her mother when she was young. The moment she smelled it, it brought tears to her eyes because it reminded her so much of her mother. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My mother is almost 90 and used to love Evening in Paris....  I priced this and a bottle is over $100.00.  Soir de Paris is a fraction of that price and she thinks it smells just like Evening in Paris.  The bottle is beautiful. Thank you so much. You made my Mum very very happy . I love it too.</li>
    <li> For years my sister regretted that they stopped making Evening in Paris - then I found it on Amazon at a great price.  It was a fantastic surprise for her Christmas!</li>
    <li> Most websites describe this fragrance as a soft, powdery floral.  Amazon&#x27;s website mentions only the scent of roses.  Here is the description EXACTLY as it appears on the back of the box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The top note is the subtle freshness of Bergamot with a refined and sweet middle note: a floral blend (Jasmin, Ylang-Ylang from the Comores islands, Turkish Rose and Violet-Iris notes) with a hint of Peach and a woody note of Cedar gives way to a sensual and powdery base of vanilla notes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of roses is completely undetectable and the only floral note that is truly discernible is Ylang-Ylang.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s ALL vanilla, heavy and nauseatingly sweet.  Nothing fresh about it.</li>
    <li> I think  like so  many  of us who grew up  with  EIP  we looked upon  this as  something  to  rekindle  those cherished memories  from  so  long ago.  For  me  it was a disappointment. Was  it because  my memory  is not what I thought  it was, or  because  my sense  of smell  is not as sensitive as  it once was or  has the formula  changed?  Given  that we can  walk  into  many antique malls and find EIP with enough residual scent to  confirm  our suspicion that the formula  has changed  I gave  it 3 stars.  The scent  is not bad  and like any  perfume/cologne  it appeals  to some and not others.  It  just  isn&#x27;t  the same  formulation  as  the EIP  of 1955.</li>
    <li> While it does not smell like the original, it is close. I was getting it for my 83 year old mom. I bought an original bottle with the tassel on ebay and transferred the perfume into it. It was quite a hit!!  The perfume came very promptly also which I always appreciate.</li>
    <li> I have loved this since my mother wore this,</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift for my sister.  She loved it in highschool!</li>
    <li> Tried to be a star with my mother-in-law by purchasing this perfume. Overheard her talking about the original one at a party and how she would love to find it again. Seems like the original is no longer made so after researching I thought I&#x27;d try this. She really appreciated the effort but didn&#x27;t like the perfume at all. Too sweet, not really close to the original. Gave it to someone who liked it so it all worked out in the end.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing fragrance.  My mother said it is very different from expected, not the old sweet Evening In Paris fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandmother. She had described the bottle and wanted it because she wore it when she and my grandfather were first married.  She was thrilled with this perfume!  Smells wonderful and was just what she was looking for!</li>
    <li> I described my rating in the other purchase box, but will repeat here. Fragrance smelled old, like perfume gone to alcohol. No real fragrance; not a bit like my memory of it. Will not be wearing it or buying it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for christmas for my grandmother. It&#x27;s hard to get a gift for someone who has everything, but I did remember her saying how she used to order this perfume in the sears catalogue back in the 50&#x27;s. I had looked everywhere in all the perfume shops, department stores, etc, and could never find it. Finally stumbled upon it on this website, and was so excited when they said they would ship to Canada. It made it here on time for christmas! When my grandmother opened her gift, she had tears in her eyes. Having thought she would never see this again, it brought back alot of great memories for her, and she says that even the scent is the same.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PERFUME, WILL NOT WEAR ANYTHING ELSE &amp; GOT IT AT A FANTASTIC PRICE!!! MY MOTHER USED TO WEAR IT BACK IN THE 50&#x27;s &amp; 60&#x27;s.THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for father&#x27;s day, since she had worn this when she was a young lady. It came in a timely fashion, but smells like stale toilet water. Not even close to the original.</li>
    <li> This reformulated parfum smells good to me, but my husband does not like it at all. It is heady but not overpowering. I will be receiving two partial bottles of the original Evening in Paris in a few days and I will find out the difference between the two. I would wear this new parfum for sure, but I don&#x27;t think it will be appealing to younger women, say, maybe under 50 or 60. But that&#x27;s just my opinion. I have to give the seller 5 stars because the delivery was so quick and the packaging was secure and everything turned out well as it should be. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 27, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I received two partial bottles of the ORIGINAL Evening In Paris today, circa 1950s(?), judging by the bottle and the cap shape. I bought them from an auction for little money and I consider myself very lucky. It&#x27;s shocking to find how fresh the original scent still is after all these years! The difference between the original and the reformulated scent is that they are absolutely nothing alike!! The original scent is powdery, sweet, light, and absolutely yummy like cotton candy. I can understand now why it was the most memorable, popular, and loved scent among women of all age groups for 4 decades. I now own both and will wear and enjoy both. The mystery is finally solved. My husband said he likes the original version much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my mother used to wear it.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve tinkered with the scent and it did not bring back the immediate memories I had hoped for.  However, it is still a very nice scent and I enjoy wearing it.</li>
    <li> just like when i was young</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother.  She was really thrilled at the sight of the bottle, it brought back old memories.  She was even more pleased later as she claimed the fragrance lasted for days.  I later bought 4 more bottles for her to give to her friends.</li>
    <li> I got this item for my mom because Evening In Paris was one of her favorite perfumes. She loves the smell and says this perfume is great too. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I rated this purchase only one star because when my mother received this order, the bottle of perfume was not full.  In fact, it was more than 1/2 empty.</li>
    <li> Just had very little fragrance</li>
    <li> This perfume was just sort of ok I think.  It&#x27;s not what I remembered it being many years ago.  I wish companies would sell samples to try out rather then buying a whole bottle and not caring for it.</li>
    <li> An old favorite that I had forgotten about, but when I opened it-the smell was still on my mind.</li>
    <li> My wife mentioned she wore this when she was a kid and loved it. So when I found it one line, I grabbed it. As turns out she still loves the scent and the retro look of the bottle. I appreciate how it is not overbearing when she first puts it on like some others.</li>
    <li> A lovely perfume, vaguely ressembling the old time Evening in Paris, but updated.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I still have the unaltered old one, so I can compare, both are nice, but event with my very &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; taste&amp;#34; the older is maybe a little bold and sweet for 2014&#x27;s everyday life. This one just perfect.</li>
    <li> This is nothing like the \\&quot;Evening in Paris\\&quot; I used to buy in the little blue bottle. I read the reviews here and understood it wasn&#x27;t quite the same. I was only hoping to have a hint of the past. That didn&#x27;t happen. The MAIN ACCORDS are all wrong.</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite perfume. The aroma stays with you all day and sometimes even after you shower there is still a faint smell there. I just love it.</li>
    <li> SOIR DE PARIS (EVENING IN PARIS) IS A WOULDERFUL PARFUM.  I HAVE ENJOYED IT FOR YEARS AND RECOMMEND IT TO ALL WOMEN.</li>
    <li> This perfume is an adaption of original Evening in Paris from 40 years ago. I love it it smells the same, bring back wonderful memories, am so glad they packaged in colbault blue bottle like years ago.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this a long time.  I used to buy it 30 years ago or more and I loved the scent.  I still have the old bottles.  In other reviews it was said that it does not smell like they remembered.  Well I do agree it seems just a little different, but I like it alot and it is pretty close.  Its a beautiful soft scent.  I read somewhere that this is a limited production, I hope not I would definately get it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It is still a good parfum but perhaps I had hoped for too much.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem so good as it used to be in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Pehaps my remembrance was not enough accurate.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Wife and she was delighted with it!!!  She is 80 years old and remembers this perfume fondly!!!</li>
    <li> it is good fragrance for all women lasts for couple of hours very small quantity is sufficient. I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of childhood memories of Evening in Paris that all the women in my family wore (except my mother who wore White Shoulders, which I also purchased). This new Soir De Paris does not smell like the Evening in Paris of my childhood, BUT none the less it is a fabulous perfume in it&#x27;s own right... and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the fragrance my grandmother wore during the 40s and 50s. I was quite disappointed when I opened the box and tried it.  Is the old fragrance still manufactured because I would still enjoy using it ?</li>
    <li> We all know and fondly remember the essences of our moms!  This is the memory of my mom while growing up! She loves to wear it still at 95! Perfect gift giving for her for your favorite lady of any age!</li>
    <li> I saw so so reviews of this but as a child I remember &amp;#34;Evening in Paris&amp;#34; in the pretty blue bottle. This is a remake and although I honestly can&#x27;t remember the original scent this is delicious.  I get complemented all the time and fragrances just don&#x27;t stay on me and this one does!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for Evening in Paris perfume for sometime.  Never knew it was from France originally.  Go figure!  I&#x27;m also looking for any Evening in Paris Vanity Collections. Great service!</li>
    <li> A beautiful classic scent. Many compliments. I just wish it was more available. Haven&#x27;t seen in stores.</li>
    <li> It is definitely like the original Evening in Paris though it does have a bit of a powdery smell. That said, it is a lovely fragrance which can be worn by many different women.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mother for birthdays or holidays. She loves the stuff. I takes her back to her childhood and swears it&#x27;s the same stuff.</li>
    <li> Not the same as Evening in Paris. Not as classy, clean and doesn&#x27;t feel as expensive. I feel Soir de Paris is already more obsolete than Evening in Paris. Comparisons aside, the scent is lovely and fresh and worth owning for itself. However, it disappoints as I expected it to remind the original that I have more.</li>
    <li> Got this for my Mum and Aunty who were remembering yester year.&lt;br /&gt;Both agreed this was not even close to the original .</li>
    <li> nothing like the original :-(</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my Mom for Christmas. She liked it, although it wasn&#x27;t exactly like she remembered from the 1950&#x27;s, when &amp;#34;Evening in Paris&amp;#34; was in English instead of French.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice light fragrance and it&#x27;s such a thrill to be able to have it shipped to Canada.  Many thanks</li>
    <li> I remember this perfume from my youth. I am up in years, but some things never leave you. This is a watered version that does not even have any scent. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Most popular scent in 1968 is back. Thoroughly enjoy it! Get lots of compliments. Not overly sweet or musky. Fresh, clean scent.</li>
    <li> When I was growing up in the 1940&#x27;s and &#x27;50&#x27;s, my mother, older sister and cousin wore this light floral scent.  For Mother&#x27;s Day I was given an Amazon Gift Card.  Since the Perfume was on Sale, I decided to use my gift card.  I am happy I did because it brings back lovely memories.  If one enjoys a airy light scent this is a wonderful scent to wear.  I only wish they had this in a bath oil since bath oils stay with me longer than most scents, even expensive perfumes.</li>
    <li> Glad I finally found it. As a child my grandma sprayed it on me and I never forgot that fragrance. It was once called &amp;#34;Evening in Paris&amp;#34; . When I saw the bottle I recognized it.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and I am using it all my life</li>
    <li> The expression I saw on my 78 year old mother when I gave her this birthday gift is beyond any word. It is wonderful that this product is still available after so many years and for that I am thankful. I will continue to purchase this product for my mother as long as she lives.</li>
    <li> I used to love Evening in Paris, but when I was young it came in an eau de toilette, which had a different fragrance than the eau de parfum.  Should there be that much difference? Such a disappointment!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this at all. Will not be reordering it. Used it as a teenager and liked it then, but not now.</li>
    <li> This scent was included in a tiny bottle in a gift box that I gave my mom for Christmas.  We loved it!  Even when my 6 year old daughter doused her teddy bear, we all loved the scent.  My mom remembers her Grandmother wearing this in the 1950s.  So, I ordered two large bottles, one for her and one for me.  It smells NOTHING like the little bottle from Christmas which my mom remembers so well.  It smells like old ladies. Yuck.  If you can find a real bottle, it smells amazing.  This is no where close.</li>
    <li> The bottle was blue. The fragrance was ok But by no means anywhere close to the true Evening in Paris scent. Since I still have some to compare it to. So I couldn&#x27;t return and no sense gifting to who I bought it for. It went,  in a secret Santa box.</li>
    <li> My Mom loves this perfume. I have been looking for it a while. This will be a great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my mother, who I loved watching getting dressed up to go out for an evening of dancing.  I got to zip her up and dab Evening in Paris on her wrists and behind her ears.  This package does not read Evening in Paris, but I&#x27;m hoping she&#x27;ll remember.  I know she will.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother in law and she loved it brought tears to her eyes literally she said she hadn&#x27;t seen this perfume since she was a child! Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Back in the sixty&#x27;s my dad always gave me a bottle of Soir De Paris for Christmas....or Evening in Paris.  I have missed him and the perfume for a very long time.  The perfume stopped being made in the U.S. in 1969, so I am thrilled that I can get it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light and a touch of sweet.  It can be used day or for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly mother for Christmas and she was THRILLED!!! It was off the market for several decades and she missed it terribly from her &amp;#34;younger days&amp;#34;. I have to admit, the scent is absolutely DIVINE! Not heavy and cloying like so many perfumes are. I hope the manufacturer does not read this, but honestly? It smells as if it should cost three times what it does!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mother.  She is 89 years old and remembered that was her favorite perfume.  It is as it was back in her early years and she was so excited to have it.</li>
