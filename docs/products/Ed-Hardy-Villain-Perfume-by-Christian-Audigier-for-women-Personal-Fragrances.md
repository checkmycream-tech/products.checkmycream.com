<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love it, it was delivered in perfect condition!  This was such a great deal on perfume I never want to buy it in the store ever again!!</li>
    <li> I love love love itt. it has a sweet yet clean scent, and how it lingers in your clothing and skin don&#x27;t forget your hair it is wonderful. I&#x27;ve gotten many complements about this fragrance, totally recommend it, Heck I got a compliment from my job&#x27;s boss.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this perfume</li>
    <li> beautiful bottle! love the aroma! while its for women I love it for myself lol</li>
    <li> Smells delicious! Was not disappointed!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever!  I cant find it in any store!  LOVE It!</li>
    <li> Love this!! Smells so nice and it&#x27;s not a strong smell! Just right</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes of all time! You seriously cannot go wrong with this. I know women in their 40&#x27;s that love this as well as teenage girls. I get so many compliments whenever I wear this!</li>
    <li> This perfume is absolutely my favorite. The citrus notes are really prominent on me, along with a subtle floral note. I never thought I would find a perfume I loved more than Samsara, but this really is it, by far the best of any of the Ed Hardy perfumes.</li>
    <li> Arrived as stated at purchase. Perfume bootle was packaged appropriately in box from store.</li>
    <li> Arrived in the mail much faster than I had expected and was an excellent price for 4.2oz! I did not even spend $30 on this. I love the scent, it has always been one of my favorites and I am happy I now have a large bottle!</li>
    <li> This is one of my top three favorite perfumes! It has a candied kind of smell, not floral. The scent lasts all day, which is hard to find in a perfume. Plus the price is great for a beautifully designed glass bottle that will last a long time. Great deal. Amazing smell. Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old woman and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this fresh and somewhat fruity delicious smell! My husband, and anyone else who smells it, love it as well! I receive compliments quite often. The metal tin is awesome too! Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume. The bottle is so pretty and I get many compliments on the scent. My fav:)</li>
    <li> I have been stalking this perfume in the malls for months. The smell is beautiful. A favorite smell of mine. But of course who wants to pay $55 just got 2.5 oz bottle of villain at the mall and 75$ for 4.2 oz.?! So I searched it on here..amazing price. Its a sweet powdered sugar smell with wooden undertones,very mature smelling nothing cheap in the smell at all. Guys could get away with wearing it as well.and ive smelled men&#x27;s villain and girls could get away with it.smells similar to the women&#x27;s but not sweet more woodsy. Overall I am addicted to this smell!!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing!! It&#x27;s fruity, sweet but not overwhelming. It&#x27;s not candy sweet. For me personally, the longer I wear it the better it smells. For the price and the amount you get it an amazing deal. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and I use it constantly. I have about a 1/4 of it left. Get it!!</li>
    <li> This is a /fantastic/ deal. I had bought a tiny 2 (or so) ounce bottle originally from a mall store when I first smelled it, and this bottle is the same price but, like, 10 times the size. It&#x27;s a fruity smell without actually smelling like food, and it has a bit of floral hints (very little, I don&#x27;t like smelling like flowers). My favorite scent to wear!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents!!!! Authentic and great price! Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for an everyday, casual scent.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Yes, it smells great. But the scent lasts about as long as it takes to walk from your bedroom to your car. Unless you plan on carrying it with you and applying it every 5min, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Disappointed bcuz it does smell really good.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Great buy for good perfume</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume on a friend and immediately had to try it on and then purchase a bottle of my own.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for over a year now and love, love, love it!  It&#x27;s one of my favorites.  A perfume I can wear daily; any time of year.  The scent is hard to describe... floral and fruity, with a bit of something else I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.  I get compliments almost everytime I wear this perfume.  My sister smelled it on me and now she has a bottle of her own.  It&#x27;s such a great perfume.  Not what you would expect from Ed Hardy.  It smells much more expensive than it is.  Do not underestimate this perfume.  It&#x27;s quality, it&#x27;s lovely, and the scent lasts.  I&#x27;ll wear Villain for years to come, no doubt!</li>
    <li> The smell last all day</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly, well wrapped in bubble paper, great price for what you get. I was a little worried I would get a smaller size than described but everything was just as described.</li>
    <li> Love the scent .... The bottle is so cute .... Great price for the size</li>
    <li> My baby likes it, and a fraction of the retail price, I like it too ; ))</li>
    <li> I love all of the Ed Hardy Perfumes.....my Daughter got me hooked.  Price is so much better than Dept. Stores!</li>
    <li> The price is absolutely amazing for being an Ed Hardy product! The perfume is very pleasing and stays on for a pretty long time. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend more than two sprays at a time because then it becomes a bit overwhelming. Also, I received my package 2 days after it was said to have shipped... And to me that is very quick. Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase and would purchase from here again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this many times before and always receive complements when I wear it.  I will continue to have this as a staple perfume.</li>
    <li> Great product great smell number one with wife she loves ed hardy.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this, I think it was her favorite x-mas gift</li>
    <li> My co-worker was wearing this scent one day and as soon as I smelled it, I just had to have it for myself!  I placed my order just a few days later.  This arrived promptly and was packaged well.  The only thing is (and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to do this?) but as I push down for each spray, the top seems a little wiggly and it leaks out the top.  It&#x27;s a must have fragrance!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this perfume which was great since she loves other Ed Hardy designs. This was her first perfume from Ed Hardy. I also bought some if the roller perfume bottles. The price was so reasonable compared to retail.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume since viva la juicy! It has such a soft sultry smell to it, and it almost smells like viva la juicy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t this product is legit. It smells like a faint watery version of the original. I cannot smell it on myself like ten minutes after applying. Maybe that&#x27;s not a bad thing considering my husband says it makes him think of tacky strippers. And not in a good way.</li>
    <li> The fragance isn&#x27;t like the original:(</li>
    <li> I just love this scent!!! Ed Hardy does it again with this amazing scent &amp;#34;Villain&amp;#34; by far it&#x27;s the best in my opinion. It last long and I get so many compliments. Ordering more when I&#x27;m out for sure.</li>
    <li> The smell if very lovely, my boyfriend loves it as well, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. It&#x27;s a pretty decent size bottle, so you can reapply often. I received the shipment before my estimated time of arrival, so that is a huge plus!</li>
    <li> Wife loves the smell of it</li>
    <li> I love this particular scent form Ed Hardy! smells so good!  It can be worn as acasual or evening. Great lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents!  Much cheaper than what I could buy in a store.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this smell! To me it smells like the retired Victoria by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
    <li> This perfume is exactly what I was described. It smells great, I knew how it smelt before buying it because this was available to buy at Kohl&#x27;s but they didn&#x27;t have to 4.2 ounce bottle. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best perfume by Ed Hardy. It&#x27;s a great value and my favorite one.</li>
    <li> I was kinda ify about getting this perfume but I have it on today and it smells wonderful.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling fragrance.  Beautiful bottle and protective tin.  Excellent value for the money!  I would recommend purchasing this product to others.</li>
    <li> a gift for my daughter.  she loves tis perfume. i was disappointed that the gift container that it arrived in was dented very badly.  amazed that the bottle wasn&#x27;t broken!  my daughter isn&#x27;t picky so she was happy-but i didn&#x27;t like the dented packaging---oh well......i just like when tuff arrives in decent shape :(</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this perfume in another perfume order. I ordered this 4.2 ounce bottle of Villian Eau De Parfum through Amazon the next day! It has a very distinct scent so different from so many other quality perfumes. My first impression is floral with a hint of citrus, then a hint of sandalwood...This perfume is delectable! As the perfume airs a few minutes, it forms a very sensual aura that last many hours. It seems to be a perfume appropriate for day or evening wear and makes you feel beautiful while wearing it!  Being a very, very discriminating shopper, I highly recommend this scent....Of course, we all have different taste in our perfumes, but  this one you might consider giving a try!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume based on the raving reviews.. I must say I don&#x27;t care for the scent.. This is my last time trusting the opinions of others for fragrances.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite!  Have a hard time finding it.  Glad I was able to find on here.  Great buy and hope I can continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I sampled this scent at a store for a joke, since I am very much not the Ed Hardy sort of person. I was with my boyfriend, and we made it about 50 feet outside of the store before we both agreed that this was one of the best smelling perfumes I&#x27;ve ever encountered. It is very light and a good floral without those harsher undertones that are common in so many perfumes. Since purchasing it I have received many compliments. If you are like me and often find that most perfumes smell too harsh on you, this could be a good one to try!</li>
    <li> It does a great job of making my wife smell good.  It should also work well on making your wife or significant other smell good too.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Smells so good! And everyone else seems to think so as well.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;m not buying another fragrance without smelling it first.  This scent smells like sugar, fruit, and a lingering note of powder. My husband says it smells like candy, my son says it smells like bug spray, and my co-worker (a male) says it reminds him of his grandmother - so I have a feeling men don&#x27;t like it either.  I&#x27;m so disappointed, and of course, I can&#x27;t return it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to smell fresh and clean - not sweet.  From now on, I&#x27;m sticking with my tried-and-true Light Blue by Dolce and Gabbana, or I&#x27;ll experiment with scents \\&quot;in person\\&quot; at the department.  No more wasting money online.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites and I purchased for my wife - she loves it! Shes happy, therefore, I am happy!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted: the right product, a low price, fast shipping...my favorite perfume. I am a happy customer, thank you.</li>
    <li> This parfume smells sooo good to me it actually boosts my confidence. I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments from both men and women. I can&#x27;t seem to find the bodywash on it&#x27;s own though and mine ran out :( This kit only had a tiny sample size tube in it. But overall, you get much more than you expect for the price. If you really want to get her attention, buy this for her. Trust me LOL</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this scent!  I have always preferred floral scents, I dislike &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; perfumes, but I always detested the musky perfumes, to me, they smelled like &amp;#34;dirty gypsy.&amp;#34;  Too much musk just brings to mind burning incense and smoky, stale outdoor kiosks.  This perfume was a delightful surprise!  It&#x27;s very intriguing, just enough &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34; to make it mysterious, sensual, and sophisticated.  Gorgeous floral notes, really nice layering.  It wears well, one application lasts all day, another light spritz on the pulse points for evening and you&#x27;re good for the night.  I actually received the set, lotion, parfum, purse spray, and body spray, and if I &amp;#34;layer&amp;#34; the lotion, body spray, and parfum, It smells a little different than when I just use the perfume.  More &amp;#34;exotic.&amp;#34;  It mixes very well with my own body chemistry.  Some scents smell great on some people, and horrible on others.  This definitely suits me!  I found my new favorite scent!</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect!</li>
    <li> this perfume is the real deal! this scent is one of my favorite scents out there. i get so many compliments and it&#x27;s just very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I blindly followed consistent ratings given to the perfume, and bought it, And yes, that worked for me. Loved the perfume!</li>
    <li> Huge bottle at great price, thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it great price as well</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it came on time!</li>
    <li> I was intoxicated by the perfume of my banker one day and I had the courage to ask her if she minded telling me what perfume she was wearing. I told her I loved the scent and I was a little shy about asking her what perfume she wore on several previous monthly visits to the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She smiled, wrote Ed Hardy Villain on the back of my deposit slip and her phone number.  Nice, but I&#x27;m already taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it the very same day and gave it to my wife as a Christmas gift and she loved the packaging and the perfume.  For men, this is a really light yet memorable perfume that will fill your head with images of love and romance.  Highly recommended if you ever find yourselves in the &#x27;dog house,&#x27; as women will fall in love with the packaging and the scent and forget she was ever mad at you in the first place.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to receive the 4.2 oz bottle like the description says. Little did I know that I would receive an entire set. It came with the body spray, lotion, 4.2 oz perfume, and a mini .5 oz perfume. For $28! Definitely impressed and will be ordering again the in the future. I highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
    <li> love the perfume for my wife, but the service is horrible, they told me this date and totally wrong a different date plus different carriers. wont buy from them anymore.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Makes a wonderful gift.</li>
    <li> Best smelling thing ever!</li>
    <li> This scent is a wonderful balance of playful and seductive! It works really well on me, and I get loads of compliments all the time. The tin is a great bonus that can be used to store other things, and I love how detailed the bottle is (the raised design allows for a more secure grip).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been totally scammed!! I&#x27;ve written a ton of reviews on Amazon...&amp; this is the first time I&#x27;ve rated any product with 1 star. This was an absolute waste of money &amp; total rip-off!!!! Never had any issues with Ed Hardy till now. The scent literally lasts for about a minute....I believe this a bottle of tap water with a few drops of perfume in it. I truly do!!! Do not buy here!!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the price for a 4oz bottle;  at other stores it cost the same for 1oz bottle</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this purfume. I get lots of compliments on it. This price is great considering this is cheaper than the small bottle at department stores.</li>
    <li> Great product. Made  for a great valentines gift for my wife. She was very pleased. We love the scent.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought the male and female versions of this brand because they both smell awesome. I actually combine them together for a unisex fragrance I call &amp;#34;Super Villain.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon after trying it at a local retail store. I loved it at the store but just couldn&#x27;t justify the price. When I saw the price on Amazon (less than half the store price) I knew I had to purchase it. I love the actual fragrance, it smells great. My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin as long as some of my other regular fragrances I use. I should purchase a mini for my purse or something because it just doesn&#x27;t have the staying power. The shipping time was average and the packing was above average. It came as described in a brand new sealed container. (Doesn&#x27;t hurt that the container is super cute and good for holding bobbie pins or something else, so it is a two for one deal I guess!  Great price, great fragrance. I am very happy with it overall.</li>
    <li> This is the second Ed Hardy perfume purchase that I have made without knowing how it smelled. As with my other order for Ed Hardy Skulls and Roses, this was a birthday gift for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;She was just as thrilled with this scent as with the previous bottle. Another 5 stars for Ed Hardy</li>
    <li> While wearing this perfume a gentleman only charged me half-price for nachos, and he specifically informed me it was because of how good I smelled. Half-price nachos: if that isn&#x27;t incentive to buy perfume, I don&#x27;t know what is.</li>
    <li> I was sooooo excited when I got my box finally (took 7 days) the smell is very close to the same as it smells in the store but very faint and it wears off pretty quick. the bottle is pretty big so an extra few squirts wont even put a dent in the amount they sent you.  I wear it out a lot though and get complements for it. was a great buy even though it isn&#x27;t the real thing next time im gonna get the real stuff though. would definitely recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> So I bought this giant bottle of Villain for the lady for her birthday, and I was hoping that this wouldn&#x27;t be fake at all.  Thankfully enough, it is not fake at all.  Matched up with another bottle of Ed Hardy that she already has in terms of distribution, and smells awesome.  Haven&#x27;t had her wear it yet, but everything was sealed properly, with plenty of bubbles to ensure the safety of the item.  I choose expedited shipping, which only cost 5 bucks, and it got here in two days.  The seller, Perfume4us, did a fantastic job.  I highly recommend this.  Guys, buy this for the lady, and ladies, wear this stuff.  It smells fantastic, and at this price for this size bottle, you can&#x27;t pass it up.  Fantastic job.</li>
    <li> This is one of Ed Hardy&#x27;s best perfumes.  I smelled it in the store and just knew I had to get it.  I wear it often and was not disappointed with the purchase!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. It is a little bit sweet, a little bit citrusy, and a lot of sassy. It is not too heavy for daytime use but it is also not too fruity or light for a night out on the town. If you also like Viva La Juicy (La Fleur, Noir, etc), this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Every was good the delivery perfect the only think it was a little damage was the case</li>
    <li> Bought this based on reviews.  I think it smells like a little girl&#x27;s cheap perfume.</li>
    <li> Awesome bottle, very nice perfume. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product.</li>
    <li> Just received Ed Hardy Villain perfume spray and its the worst thing I have ever encountered. Absolutely no smell whatsoever and after spraying it, when it drys it feels icky and heavy. Either something is wrong with this bottle or is it a \\&quot;knockoff\\&quot;. Now I will think twice about buying perfume from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite parfum, so it is always a hit.</li>
    <li> My second Ed Hardy bottle perfume. This is a very nice scent. It lasts all day and I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for the woman or women in your lives. . . smells amazing on a woman with the clothes on or off. . and she will love that you got if for her as well . . so guys give this to her for Valentines, XXXmas, Birthday, Anniversary, Special Day. . . screw it give it to her on any day she will love it guaranteed. . . .</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter. She loves this perfume and you can find it in the stores anymore. The price was amazing too.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend because she loves Ed Hardy perfumes. She has a favorite but thinks this is just as good. I recommend it</li>
    <li> My first time to wear an Ed Hardy scent and I was not disappointed. This will be one of the scents I will buy next time. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells good! It&#x27;s my second favorite perfume spray. I&#x27;d never imagine Ed Hardy actually had a nice woman&#x27;s spray. This is a really good deal.</li>
    <li> This bottle is huge! my wife was very happy she got the bigger bottle and loves the smell of it. as for me, im a guy and dont really care lol.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume so much. I&#x27;ve been looking for a scent that was unique and trendy, but also sophisticated. I didn&#x27;t want to smell like flowers or fruit and this scent smells nothing like that. It&#x27;s perfect. It smells amazing and it really lasts a long time. I get compliments on the scent on a daily basis too, which is always nice!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas last year and I love it! I get compliments on it all the time. The price is great and free shipping.. You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this fragrance! I use to buy it retail for $80. To get it for $30 is a great steal. I love the way it smells on me and I get so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Even if you apply a couple good squirts it wont clear a room or leave a scent-wake like other perfumes will. Very mild, very nice smell - sweet and soft but not too flowery or harsh.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the perfume! I&#x27;ve purchased the perfume before at the Kohl&#x27;s department store for $40 and it was only a 1oz bottle. This is definitely a deal! It was also delivered before the expected arrival date. I will definitely be ordering this item again in the near future!</li>
    <li> I received it just in time for Christmas! I&#x27;m in love with this parfum. It&#x27;s sweet fragrance makes me feel sensual and alive. Buy it today! It&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I just love it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume!! It smells so good I can&#x27;t help but spray it like 10 times. I get compliments all the time and know of at least three people that went out and bought this after I did because they loved it. Buying perfume online is always questionable, but I promise you cannot go wrong with this one! I never write reviews but figured I would for this purchase.</li>
    <li> i had 2 sets of ed hardy born wild before this one and i loved it and got tons of compliments on it but i wanted something different. i purchased this going strictly of the reviews and i usually do not do that because i like to smell what i am buying. i love it and have already started getting compliments on it. u can&#x27;t go wrong with ed hardy parfum!</li>
    <li> The Villain fragrance is rather different than the others in the Ed Hardy line, which I didn&#x27;t care for.  Villain however really smells nice, more of a fruity/sweet scent, possibly with some vanilla in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you found the Love &amp; Luck or other Ed Hardy ladies fragrances to be not quite your style, find a tester of Villain because it might suit you better.</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m feeling Naughty this brightens my day.  Several complements on  how good I smell.  It makes me giggle, and at my age I don&#x27;t giggle anymore.</li>
    <li> One Of My New Favs! I&#x27;m a HUGE Ed Hardy Perfume Fan, I Have About 6 Different Scents Of It! I Must Say I Love This One As Well As All My Others!</li>
    <li> Love the 4.2 ounce bottle!  It&#x27;s a great price especially since you pay $35.00 for a one ounce bottle in the stores!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been searching for it in stores for months, but, in the Midwest, it is hard to find. I ordered this product online, thinking I was receiving only the 4.2 oz bottle and to my surprise, I received a large tin container with lotion, body wash, a travel size perfume, a key chain, and the 4.2 oz bottle!</li>
    <li> Fragrance was fine.  Can was damaged -- not from shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the scent!  Its my go to scent I use everyday. I have a few others that I occasionally wear but always come back to Villain.</li>
    <li> I brought this perfume for my mother for her birthday and she just loves it. It has a light citrus/floral smell on her</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time. The box was packaged well and the item is better than expected. I have used many Ed Hardy colognes and parfumes and they never disappoint. They are great products at a great price.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever! Shipping was not on time at all however and my perfume container had already been opened but not used.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I was going to want this perfume.  I was walking through the perfume testers section at the department store, and I always stop and grab a bottle and spray myself with a tester, just as a treat.  I usually never buy it.  I&#x27;ll just wait until I get them as gifts at Christmas, etc.  But when I was walking through the aisle this bottle caught my eye, so I sampled it.  I couldn&#x27;t get it off my mind after that and just had to buy a bottle for myself.  That&#x27;s how much I love it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful scent and I love the bottle.  It&#x27;s beautiful on the bedroom dresser.  My only complaint and the reason I could not give it 5 stars is that the smell just does not last that long.  Just a couple of hours after application, and it&#x27;s disappeared.  If they could find a way to formulate this to last a bit longer through the day, I would happily give it 5 stars.  I&#x27;m sure I will purchase this again when this bottle runs out, regardless.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife and she loved it!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend so I also get to share in the use of it. It smells good and came in a nice package/tin. No complaints of any kind.</li>
    <li> Just like other Ed Hardy perfumes, Smells Awesome!  The smell last a while to, and dont have to use much.</li>
    <li> This perfume is awesome!I took a free sample at a department store and was hooked.Every since I started wearing it I have had at least 30 people ask me what kind of perfume I have on and where to buy it.I used to wear Lilu from Pacsun and devastated that they dc it.I am very picky and didnt think I would find one I liked..Well this one is even better</li>
    <li> A great price price for such a large bottle. Cheaper then anywhere I have looked. Loved it and will order more! Smells so good!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, she loves the scent. She also loves the mermaid design, bottle and tin. Not my type , but very popular with the teen , young adult crowd.</li>
    <li> love the perfume and great value</li>
    <li> This perfume is now my favorite to wear. It smells amazing and lasts all day. I get many compliments when I wear it. I am a huge fan of ed hardy perfume and I will continue to be :)</li>
    <li> Love it and the tin can it comes lol it&#x27;s a huge bottle at a really good price thanks have a good day</li>
    <li> My go to scent. Very clean and I get compliments. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> this is a gift for my daughter, she loves this perfume, we bought this before same size bottle and great price, The department stores are selling this for twice the price. will buy again. thanks</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than the stores and the scent is wonderful. I bought this for my wife as a surprise and she really loves it too. I would say that it it smells somewhat like the cotton candy perfume I got her but not exactly like it. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  Excellent fruity smell that I love as well.  Fast shipping and high quality.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this fragrance! It is sweet (but not too sweet) and it the dry down is slightly spicy with a hint of vanilla and musk!! This is one of my favorite scents of all time! I love love love this. Btw.. men really like this fragrance on me as well. ;)</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It smells playful and fresh. And the scent lasts more than 5 hours! Money well spent!</li>
    <li> Arrived timely! My favorite perfume</li>
    <li> I smelled Villain in a store when I was first getting into the more expensive perfumes, and more than any other perfume I tried during that visit, I couldn&#x27;t get it out of my mind. I bought it for myself as a birthday gift. The citrus-melon top notes are really delicious. I do find that on me, the cr&amp;egrave;me brûl&amp;eacute;e base note can become a little overpowering after a bit. This really disappointed me the first time I used the perfume, but it wasn&#x27;t as noticeable other times I&#x27;ve worn it. The bottle is also very cool, like a mermaid tattoo.</li>
    <li> i love this parfum also and it is so expensive here locally (if i can find it) thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> This fragrance will always be apart of my perfume entourage! One of Ed Hardy&#x27;s best scents! The price here was excellent as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal, LOVE the perfume, fast shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely do business with again!&lt;br /&gt;Oh &amp; did I mention that I LOVE the perfume!! OMG!!&lt;br /&gt;Have had multiple compliments from men, as well as, women! ♥</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Ed Hardy &amp; his great perfumes last Christmas from a close friend of mine. Recently I read another review of this particular scent and decided to try it. I had been getting Love Kills Slowly, it&#x27;s a more floral kind of scent of not too much and I always get comments on it, always. Villain is even BETTER! Its this spicy/sweet scent that I didn&#x27;t realize was even possible and I can&#x27;t get enough of it. I get even more compliments on this perfume than I did the other :)</li>
    <li> Will last a while.  Price better than local retailer which was same for 1oz.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! This is the 2nd time I have bought this one. The smell is so nice and stays for a long time. Will def continue buying!</li>
    <li> Great product. Came sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend who usually is not a fan of perfumes but she loved this.</li>
    <li> This is indeed my favorite smell . Its not to heavy but definetly a cross between sweet and woodsy , it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Have had a lot of compliments on the smell.  Not over bearing but a nice subtle smell. Highly recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS PERFUME BECAUSE I LOVED THE KIND THAT COMES IN THE RED BOTTLE THAT THEY DISCONTINUED AND THIS WAS THE CLOSEST THING TO THAT AND NOW I HAVE MY NEW PERFUME! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love villain glad it&#x27;s still available. ..keep it coming..not sure why it&#x27;s not in store anymore...Love it will purchase more</li>
    <li> Smells gooooooood.not too strong</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her new fregrance. She says it is the perfect sent for an exciting night on the town.</li>
    <li> My favorite new scent. I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day since I received it. I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes and they often give me a instant headache but I have found the EH perfumes to be perfect for me. That&#x27;s the only perfumes I own.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, it really went above and beyond my expectations!  I Will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells really good and it lasts all day! It is a very good size for the price! I loved it!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume by far. Such a fruity smell</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail today! I love this scent, it&#x27;s very fruity and fresh. It lasts all day and you don&#x27;t need a lot, just a couple of sprays. This is my first Ed Hardy perfume and I&#x27;m in love with it!!! Definitely recommend to everyone:)</li>
    <li> Smells so amazing like I remember and got here quicker than I thought it would!</li>
    <li> Bigger than I thought it was, which is a plus! I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I could have bought this for a little more than double what I would pay for it at the store, including shipping. It arrived 5 days after I placed the order and in perfect condition. The tracking also showed it would arrive June 6. It actually arrived May 30, a week earlier than I was expecting. This is the large glass bottle I&#x27;ve been wanting and when I use it all up, I&#x27;m definitely buying from here again. Love it! So glad I found it for sale here. Everyone who smells it loves it. It&#x27;s not that soapy smell, but a beautiful attention getter smell. If I wanted to smell like soap, I could just go take a shower :)</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, and a lot bigger than I would have gotten at a store around me. No regrets!</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> this smells fantastic and I&#x27;ve never had so many complements on any other perfume!</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this scent. It is affordable, just not a &#x27;classy&#x27; brand, which makes it cheaper!</li>
    <li> ...WOW...I LOVE THIS ED HARDY VILLAIN...I GET SOOOOOOOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS...</li>
    <li> My daughter is a big fan -- we purchased it for her for Christmas. She loves the fragrance, and the price was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Not the real stuff :(</li>
    <li> This is another great scent from one of my favorite artists! Love this perfume! I don&#x27;t hardly ever wear any other but Ed Hardy, and I get so many compliments on all of them!</li>
    <li> I love it. My Valentines Day gift...</li>
    <li> I love perfume Ed Hardy, but this surprised me, is super big and very cheap, crazy, because for the price one would not think how good it smells this perfume is like a summer afternoon on the dock, surrounded by fruit, sweet but not both, I can not explain just know I love to ...</li>
    <li> Excellent scent ! Bought two bottles, one for my daughter and the other for myself. Can&#x27;t beat the price for the large size. Product was shipped and delivered quickly. Thanks Amazon !!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent price for a huge bottle of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a beautiful, creamy, fruity-floral.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it alone, or layered with Villain Blue.</li>
</ol>
