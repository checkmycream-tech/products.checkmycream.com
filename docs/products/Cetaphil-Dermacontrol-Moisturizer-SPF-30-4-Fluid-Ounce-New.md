<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s really OK just OK. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again. It gets my skiing super oily. I like the smell, but other than that it does not do anything for my skin. I was looking for a moisturizer, but this one just gives me TOO much moisture for my already oily skin</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a good lotion for acne prone skin that wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores. I also tend to have oily, yet dry skin all at the same time. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this lotion. It feels a little greasy when you first apply it, but after a few minutes it absorbs nicely. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker as far as oil control, but I would definitely say it has helped reduce some of the oiliness. Best of all, my skin has definitely been looking much clearer since I started using this lotion for my face!</li>
    <li> Love Cetaphil but this burns my eyes if I sweat.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen, but be careful. If you tend to touch your face at all, this is not the moisturizer for you. Even the faintest trace on your hands will burn the heck out of your eyes if you rub them. This happened to me at some point every single day I wore this sunscreen. My eyes were constantly red. I do have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes, which has never been a problem before i used this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second order...love it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It provides excellent SPF protection, moisturized and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> Overall, this stuff is good. It didn&#x27;t make me break out. It doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious smell (most Cetaphil products are unscented). And its got SPF 30. However, I thought it was a little on the thick side. Sure, it goes on nicely, and absorbs well. Its just a little more like sunblock and less like a moisturizer. I will probably love this product come winter-time though when my skin turns into a dry flaky mess. I will also use this on days I plan on spending a lot of time outside. Its thick, but it has great SPF coverage without making me break out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. Before switching, I had used Neutrogena&#x27;s Clear Skin sunscreen on top of moisturizer (too much for my skin, I broke out) and then alone (without the moisturizer my skin was dry and flaky and I broke out more). I&#x27;d been looking for a gentle moisturizer with sunscreen and this one had good reviews so I figured I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no matte finish for me--putting it on makes my skin shinier, especially in my t-zone. I use a powder foundation, so this wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker. I give it four stars because I get SPF with all-day moisturizer and my skin has improved. Less breakouts and no flaking. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it, but don&#x27;t buy based on the matte promise.</li>
    <li> I finally found a suncreen and moisturizer I can use on my beard/stubble! I&#x27;ve been frustrated with all the other moisturizer sunscreen combo products because they always left white residue on my stubble. I tend to just trim by facial hair and not shave it off, so the stubble always was a problem. Last time I was at the dermatologist I asked the doctor (who has stubble like me) what he used for sunscreen. He specifically mentioned the Cetaphil with the purple cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it, tried it, and ... amazing! It disappears into my stubble and face with no issues at all. Now I don&#x27;t have to look like I have facial dandruff and I can still prevent skin cancer. Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t decided how I feel about this oil free moisturizer with SPF. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I do feel like it has caused some acne breakouts on my face, especially forehead and chin. I would not repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever! I used to think moisturizers were stupid and pointless untill I bought this one. Keeps my face looking great all day especially for someone like me who has oily skin</li>
    <li> Since starting to use the Cetaphil product about six months ago, I have noticed a substantial change in my complexion and my skin&#x27;s moisture retention. Instead of feeling dry and flaking across my face, I&#x27;ve minimized my problems by using Cetaphil. Beyond that, it&#x27;s a sunscreen so it works awesome during the summer when you&#x27;re going to be outside as well. It&#x27;s almost like a 2 for 1 deal. The product actually works which a lot of times in this day and age is a big feat in and of itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately moisture doesn&#x27;t get rid of signs of aging, just helps stop them from becoming more profound. I can&#x27;t put the Cetaphil around my eyes or too close to the corners of my mouth because it doesn&#x27;t react well in those spots. Instead I use [[ASIN:B009WK0M6G Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 oz. + FREE St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Advanced Body Moisturizer Gift Set]]- the retinol cream actually reduces existing age spots and lines and does not irritate my eyes. Obviously you still have to be careful and not glob it on, but it works wonderfully when applied properly. It&#x27;s not greasy so it doesn&#x27;t undo the cleaning effects of the Cetaphil, either.</li>
    <li> makes my eyes pain and itchy, tearing, then more pain and itchy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light face lotion for anyone whose face is oily or acne prone because it is not overly greasy. I dispense two pumps at night and apply to my face and neck and it does the job for overnight moisture. I would recommend this lotion to anyone with dry or mixed type skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got combination skin. Dry spots, and oily areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff kept my forehead and my nose looking great. Very matte, but not dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have blemishes, so I&#x27;m unclear if it works on those. But it is a fine product from a company I&#x27;ve used and trust.</li>
    <li> I had been excited to try this new Cetaphil Moisturizer, especially after such wonderful reviews on the Cetaphil products from family and friends.  Multiple family members had been prescribed Cetaphil products due to problem skin and had seen wonderful results.  I do not have horrible skin, but do struggle with getting rid of blackheads zits and I am in my late 20&#x27;s.  I did not have the same results as my family and friends.  Three days after using this on my face, I suddenly had the worst acne I have had since maybe I was 13!  I had produced white-heads all over my forehead, chin, and around my nose and upper-lip.  To be honest it was embarrassing to even go out.  I was shocked that a product that is made for acne-prone skin (therefore should be wonderful for sensitive skin) would only worsen my skins appearance.  Sadly, I will not be continuing the use of this product...with which I had had such high hopes.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen for anyone who has acne problems or has sensitive skin.  I haven&#x27;t had any acne breakouts while using it.  I like that it does not feel greasy and goes on easily.  I suggest this for anyone who needs a sunscreen moisturizer and is worried about their acne.</li>
    <li> I love Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisture with SPF 30. This leaves your face fully moisturized the entire day. Thes works well withe Cetaphil Demacontrol Oil Control Foam Wash. This moisturizer hydrates, protects and controls shine. this moisturizer is is a gentil formular absorbs quickly and provides a long-lasting smooth finish. This formular is very effective for oily skin ans skin that is prone to acne.</li>
    <li> I originally became acquainted with Cetaphil products through a recommendation from my dermatologist. I do have acne prone skin in the form of white heads. This means I have to be very careful not to use products that have oil or may make my skin oily. I also use Epiduo which means I have to be extremely careful to always put sunscreen on when in the sunlight. Since I live where it is sunny eleven months of the year, I need to have something that is filters a lot of the ultraviolet rays out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer is very mildly scented and is lotion-like. It&#x27;s not thick, but otherwise it is not runny. I pump a very small amount on my tip of my finger and smooth it all over my face, but I do avoid my eyes because this is a problem area with whiteheads. It is quickly absorbed. I&#x27;ve had no problem with greasiness and would recommend it to someone that is in a situation like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This combination sunscreen and moisturizer gets a good rating (2) on the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database. It has a nice consistency, and though it does leave my face a little shiny, it sinks in after a few minutes, and I often wear it without makeup. My skin does not react to it, except to feel less dry/more moisturized. The lotion has a very light sunscreeny scent that quickly fades. It&#x27;s hard to find a gentle, moisturizing sunblock for faces; along with Mineral Fusion SPF 40, this is one of my favs. for everyday wear. If I&#x27;m spending the day outdoors in the sun, I put on something stronger.</li>
    <li> Since receiving this product, upon applying and using it the few sunny times I&#x27;ve found in this great state of Oregon, it has helped. I&#x27;ve yet to be burned (and I burn fairly easily - not the \\&quot;easy\\&quot; in that if I am out in the sun for 15 minutes I&#x27;ll be red as a radish, but I AM more fair-skinned than most). I was on a weekend retreat at one point (on the coast) for which it was sunny most of the time and I used this, applied it every few hours, and I left that retreat without a burn or other signs of over-exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a few other chances to use it in other incidences as well, and it has helped. What I like is that the feel of it is not grainy - like some sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried - and it isn&#x27;t super runny or oily - like others I&#x27;ve tried. The texture feels just right and it leaves my skin feeling normal, not caked on with sunscreen or oily or grimy, or any other kind of negative/off/icky feeling. What is even cooler is that though this is a pump bottle, you can \\&quot;lock\\&quot; it by twisting the head so that you cannot press down, or, if you need to transport it in a handbag, backpack, or even in the car, if it tips or hits against other things, it won&#x27;t leak, squeeze, or \\&quot;pump\\&quot; any lotion out and onto everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer aspect is why I think it feels, well, so nice to the touch and is so easy to rub on and can be applied (pretty much) anywhere and everywhere. It is small, compact, doesn&#x27;t reek of that \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; scent. It is more of a gentle scent, if that. I&#x27;d recommend it, not only because it has a good, safe (and recommended for most) SPF, but also just because of the overall effectiveness and feel of the moisturizer itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer for a couple of months now, and am quite satisfied with the results.  One of the biggest problems I have with most facial products (even those formulated for oily skin) is that they tend to clog my pores; although it&#x27;s not specifically advertised as being non-comedogenic, I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts at all while using the Cetaphil product.  In addition, this moisturizer is non-greasy, lightweight, absorbs quickly, and does not make my face look shiny.  It also isn&#x27;t heavily perfumed; I can smell it faintly, but the fragrance seems natural and it dissipates quickly.  And I think the SPF 30 works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a middle-aged man who is constantly being told that I don&#x27;t look my age, I just want a simple product that applies easily, doesn&#x27;t draw attention to itself, and does its job efficiently.  Cetaphil Dermacontrol for Oily Skin with SPF 30 is perfect for my needs, and I&#x27;m pleased to be able to recommend it without reservations to you.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil products are usually mild on sensitive skin, but this one not so. My face had a slight burning sensation once the Moisturizer/sunblock was applied. If I applied Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion to block this sunblock from contacting my skin directly it felt much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t feel any burning on her face using it. But if she sweats this sunblock/Moisturizer easily runs into and irritates her eyes, therefore she has to clean off her eyes regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that this Moisturizer/sunblock is not milder as the texture is lightweight and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I dislike the smell.  The feel of the lotion is fine.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy.</li>
    <li> I needed a sunscreen to go under a BB cream which did not have SPF. I am on a desperate voyage to ban future freckles and rid myself of present freckles and sun spots.  This product came up on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of safest sunscreens, it&#x27;s highly affordable, and I wasn&#x27;t looking to add moisture to my face.  For this reason, I chose the product.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it does not contain oil I feel like there&#x27;s something moisturizing about it, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s what I wanted.  I am still going to complete the bottle but I DO NOT believe this to be my holy grail of sun screen/moisturizers.  I have milk acne and I can not say whether this product is helping or hindering it. I haven&#x27;t had great luck with Cetephil products to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if you get any hint of this in your eye, it STINGS like nothing else!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist prescribed me Epiduo for my mild adult acne, and they only rev omen using Cetaphil products with Epiduo. I know most of my problems are from using Epiduo (burning skin, sensitive skin, several new blemishes, etc) this product really BURNS when I use it. Epiduo also really dried out my skin and I do not feel this product help replenish moisture at all. I also feel like it makes me skin really greasy. The regular cetaphil face lotion for all skin types doesn&#x27;t do that to my skin, so I really wouldn&#x27;t expect one for oily skin to do that either. I feel that the spf properties worked well as I did not burn at all and I have fair skin and Epiduo makes you more prone to burns as well. I still like the brand, just not this product.</li>
    <li> I love the Cetaphil brand, this fell short for me however. It probably works well for most people but I have cystic acne and this didn&#x27;t seem to control my oily T-zone enough and clogged my pores. I didn&#x27;t break out terribly but it&#x27;s just not the right one for me.</li>
    <li> I have more of a dry skin type with redress from sensitivities, but thought this might work for me as it is fragrance  free, etc...  the first day I got it I put it on and within hours had about 6 pimples erupt. 3 together in a small area. It was enough to make me wash it off and I will not use it again. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product that also works great. Its helps w/the oil build up on the face while keeping the skin moisturized AND also keeps the skin from feeling sticky (the UVA/UVB protection is a plus). It says it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance but it does have  a faint chemical smell to it (which really isn&#x27;t much different from other moisturizers).</li>
    <li> When I heard that the recommendation from the American Cancer Society had been raised from SPF 15 to SPF 30 I started searching for a facial moisturizer that had that. I also have an oily T-Zone to contend with. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands (I can think of Neutrogena, Aveeno, Olay, and Eucerin off the top of my head).  All of them have left my face oily.  I would use 3 -5 blotting sheets and Laura Geller Matte Maker in the morning trying to bring the shine down (on my entire face - not just the T-Zone).  I would have to do this again mid afternoon on my forehead.  I wasn&#x27;t really happy with it but living in Florida I wanted to be careful so I kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I was curious if anything better had come out.  I looked around online and discovered Cetaphil® DERMACONTROL(tm) Oil Control Moisturizer SPF 30.  Despite the fact that I was in the middle of a bottle of Neutrogena I had to give it a shot.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I am pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It works pretty well at controlling oil.  While my face isn&#x27;t completely matte after applying, one blotting sheet in the morning can make it so.  I don&#x27;t have serious oil issues the rest of the day either.&lt;br /&gt;- It hasn&#x27;t made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;- Isn&#x27;t too harsh on my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t get this stuff near your eyes.  It stings.&lt;br /&gt;- Takes a while for it to completely soak in (30 - 60 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is has helped control my oily T-Zone and hasn&#x27;t made the rest of my face oily.  I wouldn&#x27;t say my face is completely matte but it doesn&#x27;t look like I just rubbed baby oil on it anymore either.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite moisturizers. Lightweight with an SPF and it keeps my face from getting dry during the winter</li>
    <li> Great for my oily skin. I love the SPF protection. However, when I wear my makeup over it (especially around my nose), the finish is all wrong and doesn&#x27;t act as a good base for my concealer.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer says it&#x27;s for oil prone skin, but I strongly disagree. It leaves my skin feeling MORE oily and greasy. It feels like you&#x27;re putting regular sunscreen onto your face (that same greasy feeling (it even smells like it)) instead of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this one, and if you have oily skin I highly recommend it: http://smile.amazon.com/Biore-preservation-fusion-moisturizer-SPF30/dp/B003MGI89Y/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418844724&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Biore+skin+moisturizer+spf &amp;lt;- This is what I will be buying from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too big of a fan of the moisturizer as I am of the foam wash. I did not have any reaction to it. I just think it leaves a little bit of a greasy feel on my face.</li>
    <li> Effective and good for sensitive skin (there&#x27;s no fragrance). My only issue is that it leaves my skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This was no better than a &#x27;run of the mill&#x27; oil free moisturizer. The only difference is that it burned my eyes way more than other moisturizers when I washed my face or accidentally rubbed around my eyes during the day.  It seems like a trivial complaint, but it really stings and happens pretty often.</li>
    <li> Two in one, doesn&#x27;t get any better...No white tint. And provides moisture for the skin as well. Perfect combination.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used this as her face moisturizer for 2 years now and it works great. She has really sensitive skin and it&#x27;s oily and prone to breakouts. This product causes no breakouts and it leaves her skin with a nice semi matte finish for most of the day. i used to purchase it from our pharmacy, but they stopped selling it. Gotta love Amazon for always coming through on carrying just about everything.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, but at some point during the day it tends to get in my eyes...i&#x27;m not sure how, but this is a big turnoff for this lotion. Especially in the summer...if I wear this, once I&#x27;m outside and sweating a little, my eyes will be burning.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts and this product is perfect and does not cause any problems</li>
    <li> I started using this Sunday and I also used it on my 11year old son and today we both had a rash all over our faces!! I have extremely sensitive skin but this is made for sensitive skin, or so I thought. Be careful if you have sensitive skin. My son does not have sensitive skin that I know of but his face has all the little bumps as does mine.</li>
    <li> Great product with out leaving my face oily.  SPF of 30 is great too...protection from the sun.  recommend it!  great.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin.  It controls the oil better than most.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> When you sweat or tear up it runs into your eyes and it BURNS like the dickens. Better off with oil free sunscreen! It would work better than this. 😞</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a good facial moisturizer with a high SPF that didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like there was a heavy layer on it.  This moisturizer is perfect!  It goes on light and almost feels powdery as I rub it in.  It is not a bit greasy.  I wear it all day and never get the heavy feeling I sometimes get from other moisturizers, especially in the summer when it is more humid outside.  At the same time, my skin isn&#x27;t dry or irritated at all.  It is the perfect amount of moisture for me and I plan to continue using it when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I love the sun protection and how non-greasy a feel this leaves on your skin. To me, that&#x27;s the perfect combination. I&#x27;m rating this four instead of five stars strictly based on how relatively pricey this is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very familiar with Cetaphil cleanser and moisturizer so I was very happy to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m well beyond the acne age but still use a lot of sunscreen on my face and don&#x27;t like the oily feel.  Prior to this I was using [[ASIN:B003QOZ2C8 Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with Helioplex, SPF 50, 1.4 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that this is as good Neutrogena in moisturizing without a greasy or oily feel.  It is only SPF30 where the Neutrogena is SPF50, though I&#x27;d suspect I really don&#x27;t need the higher rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump works well, something I&#x27;ve had an issue with on the Cetaphil cleanser and lotion bottles.  It&#x27;s also a better value than the Nuetrogena so so if you want to use some on your hands you won&#x27;t feel guilty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of moisturizing sunscreens. I can&#x27;t leave the house without it on my face. It&#x27;s ALWAYS on me if the sun is out. I also suffer from bad acne for the past 17 years and my skin is very oily. So you can imagine me putting sunscreen on, which usually adds alot of shine to one&#x27;s skin, and then my oils kicking in three hours later. It&#x27;s not pretty. I look like I was just working out, and not in a good way. My face becomes shine-central.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used so many products, it&#x27;s ridiculous. From all the cheap ones, to many expensive ones. Some were good, some were great but super expensive. Some were just bad, terrible, or uncomfortable to wear on my skin. This product is different. There is no stickiness, especially an hour or two later. There is no oiliness; especially an hour or two later. It goes on matte. It has no smell. It has almost zero shine (kind of impossible not to have shine if you are a product designed to block/reflect sun). If anything, this product kept my face from getting oily. It somehow absorbs or tells my glands to STFU. My face always oils up through a product. But not with this one. My skin was pristine all day. And the best part! It&#x27;s noncomodogenic and oil free. So my acne has to find other reasons to flare up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a miracle. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. Too bad it took me 15 years to find something this great.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Good price. Arrived a day early. Good product for sensitive acne prone. One small thing, bottle was leaking lotion in box when arrived. Overall good delivery &amp; product. Will order again when time.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin of normal everywhere except the T-zone (brow bone + nose area) that gets oily, and this product really surprised me by matte-fying my skin and controlling oil. It&#x27;s very light, absorbs easily, and gives an almost primer-like finish (read: silicone-like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, recently I&#x27;ve found that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized much anymore. This may be because my skin is used to this product from using it daily for 5 months now, or because the weather is cooler and my skin is more dry. I still use it for the SPF30, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel good using this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is good for warmer weather and for oily skin. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and moisturizing property of this lotion.  It&#x27;s hard to find a nice, sheer lotion with an SPF over 15, so this is great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the positive reviews this product has received.  Either the company has a really terrible quality control process and I happened to get a bad batch, or this product is very, very dependent on your skin type.  Based on my experience with this product, I absolutely would NOT recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that is both oil and acne prone.  The first time I used this moisturizer, I immediately noticed an uncomfortable burning sensation all over my face, that was actually painful around my eyes, and persisted for several minutes after application.  The next thing I noticed was that when it gets into your eyes (which it will if you use it on the skin around your eyes) it BURNS - EXTREMELY painfully.  Despite this, I tried using it a few more times over the next few days, to see if there was just an adjustment period for my skin.  Nope - it continued to burn painfully upon application, and after 2 days I had developed a red rashlike area under one of my eyes that looked and felt much like a chemical burn.  Needless to say I stopped using this immediately and switched back to my previous moisturizer.  It took 4 days of constant application of my normal moisturizer to soothe the skin under my eyes and remove the red burn patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the pain and chemical burn, this product smells like sunscreen and didn&#x27;t visibly reduce the oiliness of my face anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for an oil-control moisturizer, but this is clearly not it.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law was raving about this product so I am glad to have a chance to try it. Along with the foaming cleanser, I must say that I love the feel and texture and consistency of Cetaphil as a face moisturizer. The SPF is 30 so that&#x27;s minimum for what I like to wear on my face. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no reaction whatsoever and it feels really nice when I apply my bare essentials makeup over it. I love it. I think I will be switching to this for good .... thank you!</li>
    <li> it makes me laugh each time i read &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34;. i gave this moisturizer way too much time than i should have . after over two months of using this stuff, i finally found a different moisturizer (not this one) that fits me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i suffered from oily skin for many years like most people and finding a day moisturizer and cleanser for us oily folk can be difficult. i won&#x27;t ramble on my trials and errors but skip to what i&#x27;ve learned: basically i now stay away from products that read &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; or any other claims for oily skin. why? because their claims may actually hold truth. you see when a product take for instance &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; begins its process in controlling your oil levels it will actually throw your skin off balance, hence it will send the signal to begin producing more sebum (oil) through your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i&#x27;m no scientist or chemist nor go step by step on the process or progress of this product, but what i do know, based on my experience, is the result - my skin is still oily if not oilier. hope this helps</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for those with oily/acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> this is my second order of the moisturizer.  I have been using this for a few months after finding it on the sunscreen rating website.  So far, it works great for my skin type (sensitive, oily, acne prone, clog prone)</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars because I was surprised by the scent.  It was somewhat unpleasant at first but, I think I&#x27;ve become used to it.  Also, I was expecting the moisturizer to absorb oil when applied but, it didn&#x27;t.  It did, however, control the oil throughout the day - just like it says.</li>
    <li> I love this too!  I have adult acne and sensitive skin and this and the dermacontrol cleanser are the only products that cleanse without making me feel dry and moisturize w/o making me feel oily.  Good price !</li>
    <li> Makes my skin more oily</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil brand products for my face since I have sensitive skin and eyes.  Any given day my skin can range from dry (in the morning if I forget to put on moisturizer overnight) to very oily (throughout the work day).  I would blame the excessive &amp;#34;oiliness&amp;#34; throughout the day on the weather being that I live in Hawaii, however I work indoors with AC.  I guess I just have finicky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer has no scent and has a suntan lotion consistency.  It appears to be a bit more runny than my nighttime &amp;#34;YESto&amp;#34; moisturizer which I love.  My problem with the product is that it seems to eventually get into my eyes throughout the day making them bloodshot and irritable (the same thing happens when I use sunscreen on my face at the beach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t look forward to using this moisturizer daily, but have yet to find another daytime alternative for my difficult skin type.  For the price ($13.49) and properties of the product, I feel that it deserves at least 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Not easy to find moisturiser for combination/oily skin with a high spf</li>
    <li> Made my eyes burn (on multiple occasions) when you sweat and the sunscreen runs into your eyes. My eyes are ok, but I&#x27;m wary of using this product again.</li>
    <li> Greatest product ever!</li>
    <li> My skin hates me... most days.  I am a 30-something year old woman who has a constant battle with my skin.  I have tried multiple products out there to make sure that a) my skin is moisturized, b) has sunscreen, c) non greasy, and d) doesn&#x27;t cause more breakouts.  In my 20s, my skin was in it&#x27;s worst shape and now I have some pocking from the acne scars (curse you stupid cystic acne) and years ago, my doctor had me use Cetaphil wash for my face, which was GREAT!  The most gentle skin cleanser out there, but it did nothing for my acne.  Well, now I use Clinique&#x27;s Acne Solutions for my acne but even with the entire set:  wash, toner, acne moisturizer and the dramatically different moisturizer- I have a dry face.  Once I received the Cetaphil Dermacontrol moisturizer- I finally have a solution! I use the clinique solution kit at night and Cetaphil facewash and Dermacontrol moisturizer in the morning. PERFECT!  The moisturizer is VERY light and once it dries- your face still feels VERY clean and you can SEE that your skin is moisturized.  I also put it on the back of my hands to protect them.  I live in Phoenix, which is very dry and having a nice moisturizer WITH a SPF of 30 is PERFECT!  I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and I have had NO NEW BREAKOUTS!  Cetaphil&#x27;s Dermacontrol Moisturizer is a WINNER in my skin care line up!</li>
    <li> Get it for the SPF, not for the oil control. I have truly oily skin and it does Not control oil one bit. If you have oily skin like me and have tried many lotion type products to &amp;#34;control oil&amp;#34;, just skip them and go straight for an eye primer. Eye primers are much more geared towards oil control, they are extremely matte to allow for eyeshadow to stay in place. Personally, I use Urban Decay, but I imagine any good eye primer will do. I mainly use it on my nose and some parts of the forehead. Works so much better.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice light moisturizer.  It&#x27;s supposed to be oil-control, and it is for a while.  But by the end of the day my face is very oily.</li>
    <li> I have some other cetaphil facial sunscreen, but it has always caused break outs for me. This product doesn&#x27;t, and it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than what I was buying. I&#x27;m very pale so I wear sunscreen on my face every day. Since I started wearing this (about a month ago), I&#x27;ve had many, many fewer break outs. I highly recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great for my acne prone skin. As with all mosturizers, gotta find the right one for your skin,</li>
    <li> Still leaves my skin greasy and stings your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days now.  It goes on nicely and makes my skin feels moisturized with no strange scent.  I put it on before I apply my makeup each day.  As far as I can tell, it is doing the job it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer with SPF 30.  I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I have no idea what these negative reviews are about- but thank goodness I went against them, and purchased this spf lotion!!&lt;br /&gt;Scent: barely any scent! I hate the scent of sunscreen- this moisturizer has a subtle scfent only if you smell your fingers haha&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have to wash my hands after applications!&lt;br /&gt;White Tint: NO white tint....and I a good amount of this on my face!&lt;br /&gt;I use the cetaphil facewash, cetaphil moisturizer, and this sunscreen. NO BREAK OUTS- and my skin is very very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me- just purchase it. I have found my lifetime daily sunscreen for my face. Also- the bottle is a medium size, will for sure last me a long time! DO IT!</li>
    <li> This stuff will BURN your eyes. I didn&#x27;t believe the other reviewers thinking it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me. I use it everyday and honestly it happened every time. even if i don&#x27;t apply it around my eyes it somehow spreads into my eyes. And lastly, its not an oil control moisturizer. This is completely the opposite. Just after 1 hour of use my face is super OILY. This stuff is garbage, don&#x27;t waste your money, seriously.</li>
    <li> The only thing I have against this moisturizer is that when I put on makeup and it smears into my eyes... IT STINGS! and it lasts for the rest of the day. If I&#x27;m not wearing makeup then its perfect. It absorbs pretty quickly. but residue if it gets into you eyes it will sting.</li>
    <li> The product says it helps oil control, I feel like my skin was still oily with the moisturizer and it also claims to help with acne, but I got more acne after I started using this! So no, I will not be buying it again nor will I recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer because it comes with SPF 30 and it doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky white film on my face. I&#x27;m not sure if it really helps with oil control as I still use oil blotting papers religiously but it doesn&#x27;t break me out and it&#x27;s not super expensive so it&#x27;s a win in my book. At some point I will probably look for something to replace this as I think the ingredients aren&#x27;t necessarily the best (pareben free, organic, chemical free) but for now it works and it&#x27;s at a great price point.</li>
    <li> Love the product and have been a loyal customer for over a year. My dermotologist  highly recommended this product as part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly without that awful ashy looking cast that some sunscreens can leave behind ( am a medium toned, black women of Caribbean decent). Does NOT cause breakouts in my VERY acne prone skin and is not oily! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME. it has a score of 2 in the skin deep database. it&#x27;s not greasy and really controls the oil on my face - but my face isn&#x27;t really that  oily. it&#x27;s awesome, as long as you keep it away from your eyes! I was too exhuberant one time and got it under my eyes. my eyes watered for about 2 hours, like I was crying.</li>
    <li> I have such oily skin. This, matched with the face wash has actually made my face less oily. I don&#x27;t have to blot during the day anymore. Just wash twice and day and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have oily skin really but this stuff definitely doesn&#x27;t leave a matte finish like it says.  It&#x27;s ok because I can put powder over it but I was hoping for a facial lotion with SPF that I could wear alone and not look greasy or shiny.  I bought this because it says it leaves a matte finish.  It doesn&#x27;t but it still protects my skin from the sun and it&#x27;s not super greasy.</li>
    <li> My partner is the one with the sensitive skin. Any amount of perfume in a product will make him break out. I thought he might like to try this...but he swiftly said he didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think why. I love it. It softens my skin and is completely lacking in greasiness. I use it on my face and head (I am bald) and it has in the past few weeks, made a noticeably difference in my skin. ALSO, I like the SPF 30. I can go out in the sun with my bald pate and not have to immediately put on a hat. (And if I do, the hat is not stained by the lotion I have used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a little more expensive than the lotion I usually use, but I am going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Great daily face moisturizer.  Not greasy, absorbs fast so I can easily put make-up on shortly after.  I love the sunscreen protection too.</li>
    <li> Since the weather has gotten warmer, I&#x27;ve been putting this moisturizer on. The sunsceen part of it works really well. There&#x27;s nothing worse than putting on sunscreen and have it be either oily/greasy (like some of the spray sunblocks) or too sticky. There&#x27;s no strong smell to it, which is a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really great for those who are prone to oily skin on your face. My forehead tends to get oily and this moisturizer has helped control it. And I haven&#x27;t had any bad breakouts while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this moisturizer for the upcoming summer season.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2.5 months now and it is awesome. I absolute love the SPF 30 which is something that many moisturizers lack. The price as well is a great selling point. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin shiny and greasy as the other cetaphil moisturizer I had been using prior.</li>
    <li> I experienced the burning eyes too and I was careful not to apply it around my eyes.  The first time I wore it, I was on my way to the gym.  I had to stop for eye drops because my eyes were burning like crazy.  I used the drops all throughout my workout and then on my way home, my eyes started burning and tearing up awfully.  I could barely see, and I had to race home to wash my face in total agony.  I started crying which helped a bit, but not enough.  Will never use again!    p.s. It wasn&#x27;t the eye drops because I have used them before and they are rated well by EWG and similar to your own natural tears.  Also, I wasn&#x27;t sweating at the gym since I was only lifting weights and skipped cardio.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen and moisturizer. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and non-shiny. In the past, I&#x27;ve use Neutrogena moisturizer/sunscreen, but it left my skin feeling like there was a caked layer of crud on my face. This moisturizer does not give me that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Do not apply it within a half inch of the bottom of your eyelids; it may irritate your eyes.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the smell... TERRIBLE SMELL. I have never used this brand before tho so I don&#x27;t know how their products usually smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 5 because it certainly is not a 4. It&#x27;s very low -- a 2-- on EWG scale (that&#x27;s a good thing). I wouldn&#x27;t say I have oily skin but I decided to try this one. It certainly doesn&#x27;t make me break out and is nice and light for under a BB cream. Non-greasy yet also doesn&#x27;t feel like a coating.  I get compliments that I glow frequently and feel like I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in reduction of freckles being preventative.</li>
    <li> Not too oily. Works well.</li>
    <li> I found that while this moisturizer did control oil and wasn&#x27;t greasy, it made me break out horribly. I would wake up every morning with new whiteheads all over my face as well as some deep cystic bumps (and yes, I wash my face every night before bed). I had to stop using this on my face for this reason. I still use it on my chest, hands, and arms because it is nice and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I use a prescription acne medication at night which usually causes me to wake up with dry and flaky skin, but my skin also gets oily throughout the day. I was looking for a moisturizer, with SPF, that would help with both of these problems. I used to use Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, but it made my skin very greasy. I don&#x27;t get oily at all with this moisturizer, and it works well at getting rid of dryness and flakiness in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;If you see a dermatologist, I recommend asking for some free samples of this before buying to make sure it will work well with your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the first time screen for my face which is very oily you have no idea how much I have suffer from that, but I finally see. They are products there especially for oily face and this is one of the best ones that I have found and come across with from 1 to 10 my face oil is 10 that can give you an idea how much I have struggle to find products that are perfect for my face and this is a perfect product for everyone who has spoiled the face.</li>
    <li> I looked for many SPF moisturizer creams and I think this is my new favorite (meaning I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this since I finally found something I like).  I can use it with my other acne products and they don&#x27;t interfere with one another.  I also really like the fact that this is truly a scent free.  Many lotions claim the scent free, but this one has no lingering smell.  Further, it doesn&#x27;t leave any traces like some SPF ones do (you know, you look like you are trying to become a vampire due to the white particles not disappearing!).</li>
    <li> Having tried numerous moisturizers in the past 15 years, I keep coming back to Cetaphi&#x27;s Dermacontrol Moisturizer.  It is a fraction of the price of many department store name brands and just as well, if not better!  It moisturizes and provides SPF coverage without leaving my skin greasy or causing breakouts.  I use this not just as a moisturizer, but as my primary face sunscreen.  It also has a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep  - meaning that it has a low hazard rating for product safety.  I feel better about using something on my skin daily that is not also hazardous to my health.</li>
    <li> I know from my dermatologist Cetaphil makes great products so I was excite to try this product.  I use 0.025 generic Retin A (tretinoin) nightly and my dermatologist suggested I put a moisturizer on 30 minutes or more after the tretinoin to reduce the peeling I have the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this moisturizer wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough so I&#x27;m back to using Moisturel cream over the tretinoin.</li>
    <li> With Cetaphil on the label this had to be a winner and it is. It&#x27;s definitely a niche product. I&#x27;m not exactly acne prone but I&#x27;ve found this to be a very refreshing lightweight moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it more like a body lotion than a facial moisturizer and it feels clean and light.</li>
    <li> Pros: Provided a good amount of hydration without making me immediately greasy, smells ok, great amount of spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not prevent greasiness for more than a few hours, caused me to breakout (not sure if it&#x27;s interacting negatively with the Alpha Hydroxy AHA lotion I apply before).  The breakouts were definitely noticeable; from a clear face to 4-5 blemishes by nighttime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It seems to be coincidence that the breakouts started right when I started using this, but they disappeared when I stopped using the AHA.  The AHA appears to be the culprit.  Still can&#x27;t give 5 stars since it doesn&#x27;t quite control oil all day for me and it stings like crazy if it gets near your eyes (say while sweating/working out).</li>
    <li> The face wash is a foam and it takes 3 pumps to cover my entire face.  Unlike with the Cetaphil liquid, the foam feels like it is actually cleaning my skin and I get the satisfaction of having the suds wash away the grime.  I wash with this every morning and then follow up with the Oil Control moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read complaints about the smell being medicinal or overwhelming for both products, so I was unsure about trying it since I am sensitive to smells.  Fortunately I had no issue with the smell at all and find it rather nice.  It smells subtly clean.  It does linger and probably more so in my case since I follow up with the moisturizer.  I like that the foam does not leave my skin feeling tight yet it feels completely clean at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my face I put on the moisturizer.  The moisturizer smells a little like sunscreen, but I find it nice since it reminds me of the beach.  It absorbs quickly and is light and non-greasy.  If I wear any makeup that day, I put the moisturizer on first then my primer.  I have had no issues wearing it under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it contains an SPF so I don&#x27;t have to worry about adding an additional step to my routine. I have fair skin and burn easily, yet when I have been outside in the sun for several hours my face did not even get pink even though my arms did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used these products for several weeks now and there is a subtle change in the oiliness and shininess of my skin.  I have extremely oily skin so the true test will be when it is the middle of summer and it is 90+ degrees outside.  But after living with seriously oily and acne prone skin my entire life any improvement is awesome, especially at what I consider a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the two products do seem to control oil.  Keep in mind that control does not mean eliminate, which the product does not claim to do.  Actually I don&#x27;t want to completely eliminate the oil since that will help keep wrinkles at bay just a little longer than it would with someone that has dry skin.  I also like how simple they are to use and they are what I consider products with no-frills.  As a mother of four I do not like a high-maintenance routine since I do not have the time or desire to keep it up.  So this fits rather nicely into my morning schedule and still manages to work pretty well.es at bay just a little longer than it would with someone that has dry skin.

    <li> I regularly use cetaphil daily moisturizer for my face, and it is the only product I&#x27;ve found that a. doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies. b. doesn&#x27;t give me pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, is quite a bit like the regular cetaphil daily moisturizer,  even though, unfotunately it isn&#x27;t perfect. Like most moisturizers I get a few blocked pores in my forehead which tends to create cysts. This product is very mild, and easy to apply, if a trifle pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had trouble finding it in the store, but the other types of cetaphil are regularly available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, because it it the only product I can use, even though, it still does clog my pores.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son to use for his back and upper arms. It&#x27;s very light and fragrance free. He wore it to the pool and it stayed on even after swimming. His skin didn&#x27;t dry out like with some acne lotions. The lotion also didn&#x27;t come off on his tshirt!</li>
    <li> First off, this product most definitely smells like sunscreen - it&#x27;s a light scent, but it still has that scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying a small amount daily for several weeks and don&#x27;t really notice anything special about this product as an moisturizer - especially with regards to its claims of being clinically proven to help manage oily skin. (My face still feels oily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that it takes a long time for it to absorb into my face, even after a shower with my pores wide open. This means having to wait to apply foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the idea of a moisturizer having an SPF of 30 but since I only apply my makeup in the morning I wonder how effective it really is throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I really liked this moisturizer. I have oily skin as an adult and I do believe that this helped control the oil on my face. I got less pimples with this product than with my normal moisturizer. I have since switched to this one.</li>
    <li> light - great for my combination skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s convenient, as it has a nice spf rating to it. Keep in mind that because of this, it does kind of smell a little like sunscreen. Overall, I like it. Definitely has helped with my complexion, as UV radiation can cause breakouts, and keeps my skin from drying out throughout the day.My nose, on the other hand, is quite oily. If I add the same amount on as the rest of my face (Which isn&#x27;t that much, mind you), my nose gets very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect, but I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, and typically Cetaphil is great for me. I&#x27;ve used both Cetaphil&#x27;s SPF 15 and SPF 50 moisturizer in the past before this one. I&#x27;d say this Dermacontrol SPF 30 doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite enough for me, but it does keep me from getting sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that the SPF 50 product here is the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used in terms of the moisture and sun protection [[ASIN:B001GIOW3G B001GIOW3G]] -- BUT that SPF 50 product also leaves behind a subtle white film on the skin. That might not be noticeable on some skin tones, but it&#x27;s could be weird looking for others!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dermatologist and she is very happy with the results.  We will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> This product was fine for about a week, it even cleared up some dry patches. Then I started to notice that I was breaking out more than usual. The longer I used it the worse and more spread out the break outs got. My skin began getting irritated and red all over, I&#x27;ll be switching brands ASAP!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather disappointed given, after using the same brand of oil control wash, I assumed this would also provide oil control WHILE ALSO protecting me from the sun&#x27;s rays. So far the sunscreen aspect seems fine - though it&#x27;s just a bunch of chemical blockers instead of physical ones like zinc or titanium oxide. Which you could pay half as much for nearly twice the amount of ounces you get in this. Additionally, the aforementioned physical blockers are \\&quot;better\\&quot; suited for sensitive and acne prone skin - just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specifically got this moisturizer for the oil control/acne aspect. I&#x27;ve battled acne prone, sensitive, photosensitive, oily skin for over 20 years now. I&#x27;m beyond sick and tired of the lip service and promises companies make, using the same ingredients other products use and slap a heavier price tag on it because it&#x27;s meant for acne prone people like me. Which, if it worked, I guess would be tolerable, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything I use is oil free, oil control, etc. I decided to incorporate this in some vain hope it would tackle my oiliness. Nope. Zit (I mean zip). Within an hour of application I&#x27;m just as oily as if I&#x27;d not put anything on at all or put on a regular sunscreen. If you want an overpriced sunscreen made with chemical blockers be my guest. I could have seen passed it had it done something about the oil. It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t market it as an oil control when it doesn&#x27;t even begin to address it. The oil control wash they make seems to work great. The follow up lotion (which is more expensive) leaves much to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, when I purchased this I wasted nearly $16 on greasy sunscreen, which is essentially what this product is.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I like this product a lot. I have a very oily tzone and this moisturizer really helps!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for it&#x27;s intended use. I like that I moisturize and get protection from the sun in one step. Beware, the sunscreen properties of this lotion makes for burning eyes if it gets there.</li>
    <li> excellent, doesn&#x27;t make skin oily or greasy, but effectively compensates for some of the more drying acne washes</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would give me less oil and shine but I was wrong. Supposedly a derma control moisturizer/sunblock for me since I&#x27;ve been breaking out but I don&#x27;t see any improvements... I&#x27;m going to give it a little more time...But my face is still shiney!</li>
    <li> This product is mildly comedogenic and will most likely make you break out if you are suffering from acne.&lt;br /&gt;*** Carbomer is mildly comedogenic. This product also makes your face really oily especially if wearing it through the day. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for people with oily skin. It does not control oil production on the face.</li>
    <li> To be honest it feels good, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;However, I couldn&#x27;t apply it again cuz it HURTS my eyes and they keep tearing even though I alpplied it away from my eyes. I use it on my hands during the day, and it is just okay.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 because it dried out my oily face a little too much. I use it just 3 times a week....  I was looking for a daily moisturizer though.</li>
    <li> Owww. I got this in my eyes and they&#x27;ve burned for a couple hours. I think getting sprayed with pepper spray would&#x27;ve felt better. Be careful around your eyes. Seems like a nice moisturizer otherwise. Always have had nice results using cetaphil products. My dermatologist recommended cetaphil to me me and he is one of the top dermatologists in the DC area.</li>
    <li> Works great for me! I use it in the mornings, after the foaming face wash. I&#x27;ve had no issues with this under make up so far. Will be repurchasing this and the foaming face wash.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the face wash with great results. I am usually very sensitive to the sun block in moisturizers, but this does not bother me at all. Also, in combo with the face wash I am noticing less oil for most of the day. Not complete matte finish, but nothing a little blotting and some powder won&#x27;t fix!</li>
    <li> Looks just like website I am happy with product exactly what I wanted when I ordered, thank you so much! use this sender he is great!</li>
    <li> Truly works on controlling oily skin without drying out your skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help any with oily face. Makes face even more oily. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> This stuff really works for me. My skin is quite oily and not only has it given my skin a nice, matte finish throughout the day some of my acne has cleared up as well. A word of caution: if you have sensitive skin this may not be the product for you. I have a sensitive spot of skin right above my lip. Once I slathered this stuff over the spot it stung quite badly. I learned to avoid that specific area and use regular Cetaphil cream on that spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on extra dry days (read: winter) I&#x27;ll have dry patches on my cheeks by the end of the day. Since my cheeks aren&#x27;t normally oily I can see the true power of this product&#x27;s oil-control. Some days I&#x27;ll put regular Cetaphil cream on my cheeks and other dry areas underneath this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it really does control oil. Be careful if you have sensitive skin. Dry patches may occur, adjust with regular cream as needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent for moisturizer as well as sunscreen protection. Easy to use esp for teenagers looking for shortcuts.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have to give this product a thumbs down, due to breaking out in hives on my neck when using it.  Too bad, because otherwise it seemed to do a good job of controlling the oil on my face.  No choice but to discontinue use.</li>
    <li> My daughter cannot wear most sunscreens but she had no problem with this one.  It did it&#x27;s job in protecting from the sun while also protecting her sensitive skin. I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Love this face lotion. Non greasy, I buy extra face lotions and add it to my body lotion so I get the benefit of the SPF.</li>
    <li> My skin feels and looks oily as soon as it&#x27;s on my face....and i use a small amount.  So where&#x27;s the oil control in that.....</li>
    <li> Oily as oily can be! Shocking for any Cetaphil product, cause I&#x27;m a long time patron. One pump left my face feeling slick and very shiney. Might as well use cooking oil! Was a waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> anything cetaphil is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year because it works well for my skin.  It was slightly cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was going to be too oily, but it&#x27;s not. I really like this moisturizer and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer because lately my face has been increasingly dry due to the weather. I decided to go with cetaphil because it was cheap and also is at an spf level of 30 which is perfect for me as I am out a majority of the day biking from class to class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer isn&#x27;t too greasy and relieved the dry flakiness of my face immediately after use. It&#x27;s a great buy as it is a moisturizer and suncreen!</li>
    <li> I purchased this elsewhere and had high hopes for it. Instead, I had itchy, watery eyes. I noticed it didn&#x27;t have a matte finish as advertised either. The concept is good but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> I got this because I wanted a moisturizer with a higher SPF than what I had previously been using.  I started using this and thought it was great until I was sweaty one day and some got into my eye.  My eye started watering and stinging wildly.  I didn&#x27;t know why my eye was so irritated , but when it happened again, I figured out it was my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizing qualities of this lotion are fine, but I probably won&#x27;t buy this again and will try to find something else because of the eye irritation issue.</li>
    <li> great product.  I have oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.  not heavy like regular sunscreen.  easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a little too moist on the face during hot, humid summer months, in which case I recommend one of those \\&quot;dry feel\\&quot; sunscreens by Neutrogena or Banana Boat. they&#x27;re great for that, and cling to the skin better when it&#x27;s sticky out.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I will use for my oily acne prone skin. I am 50 years old and still battling occasional acne. Have been using for a year now and plan on using for many years to come, Love this product and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t feel too oily and seems to be working very well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t love it, it is too creamy, it clots your pores and you end up sweating a lot. Not the best choice if you have oily skin. I stopped using it and changed to a foundation with SPF.</li>
    <li> Product in good condition and quick delivery...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing great with my skin which is normally oily and acne-prone.. I have used it for one month now, there&#x27;s a great difference</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this has SPF 30 vice the other Cetaphil product. It doesn&#x27;t leave a very white residue that&#x27;s a common problem with some sunblock products.</li>
    <li> I like this because it is a non-oily sunscreen that also moisturizes. It doesn&#x27;t seem to control face oil very well though, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I wear it every day after using the oil control wash of the same brand.</li>
    <li> Not greasy.  Just remember this stuff is not sweat or waterproof..  Great for times when you won&#x27;t be sweating while out and about without having that greasy look.</li>
    <li> STINGS YOUR EYES- this moisturizer is fine, as long as it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes. But if you sweat, rub your eyes, or get teary, you will get the worst stinging sensation of Armageddon (!), and the more you rub your eyes to get it out the worse it gets. It&#x27;s awful. Best way to deal with it is to wash your face to get the moisturizer out. I also didn&#x27;t apply this near my eyes when putting this on, and it still irritates them.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find this torture worth the sun protection, so I replaced this with an equivalent Neutrogena product.</li>
    <li> Last night, someone actually complimented my skin!! I attributed it to the use of this product. I have very oily skin and some hormonal acne. After washing my face, it tends to be tight and dry, so I still like to use moisturizer. I love that this has SPF in it, goes on easily and completely. My face has considerably less breakouts and looks &amp;#34;rosy and glowing&amp;#34; as a friend described last night. It&#x27;s priced at a point where it&#x27;s worth it to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> It stings my eyes after a few hours of application, almost like it slowly drips into your eye. Gonna use it up then go back to my original product... Aveeno</li>
    <li> I suffered from oily skin in my teens and early 20s, but had pretty much grown out of it by my late 20s.  Then, a month ago I had a septoplasty which all of a sudden gave me back the same oily skin from my younger days!  I was not prepared for this and my regular sunscreen moisturizer just wouldn&#x27;t do because it appeared that my skin was literally doused in oil.  This is not the look you&#x27;re going for at the start of a day!  After this surgery it was recommended that I wear 30 SPF sunscreen at all times since my skin was ultra sensitive to the sun.  I looked to you, fellow Amazon reviewer, to find a perfect sunscreen moisturizer for oily skin.  This is it!  It is so gentle and has not irritated my skin at all (I even used it post glycolic peel!).  I put a heavier layer on, go about my morning business with other tasks and let it absorb into my skin to make sure I get good sun coverage.  Even doing this, when it dries, it is not oily at all!  There is a light shine to it after application, but I use a powder finish instead of foundation and it balances out just fine.  Even with my hyper sun sensitive, post-surgery, fair skin, I have not had any issues with sun exposure and no burns!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t irritate it and it works. The second benefit is the sun block. I work outside and the sun caused dry skin on my face. My dry skin was gone in 3 days.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this product has not been an issue. Most sunscreens and moisturizers sting when I apply them to my face, not this one.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I either received or ordered the wrong product. The one I received is for oily skin and I have dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have to wear sunblock every day in the summer because I am of Scottish descent and have zero tanning ability, and I live in a sunny area of the country.  Most of the sunblocks at stores are really greasy and perfumed, which is a non starter for me. (I will never understand the point of heavily scented sunblock.  Are there people who need sunblock and, coincidentally, also need to cover themselves with perfume?). Anyway, this one is even better than even Neutrogena, as it seems to disappear once it&#x27;s applied without any grease. Maybe they put some powder in it or something.  It is not tears free so DO NOT use it near your eyes.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for getting daily SPF protection on your face. Feels more like a light moisturizer than a sunscreen. Not a matte finish by any means, but not greasy or clogging. No annoying scent - not really much of a scent at all. The pump dispenses just the right amount for my face too.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes, but definitely not a product for very oily skin.  It leaves a definite shine, I have to actually blot with my oil absorbing sheets after I have applied and let it dry.  On the plus side, this has not broken me out.</li>
    <li> Bought this at Target actually but just had to write a review somewhere. I paid about $14 for this which considering the amount you get is okay, but still kind of pricey. I have combination oilly skin, extremely dry in the winter and very very oily in the summer. I was looking to try a new summer moisturizer that would help control my oiliness. I like that it has SPF but personally the smell of the sunscreen isn&#x27;t the greatest. Applied smooth and felt moisturizing during application without being too greasy, but I never felt like it actually sank into my skin, it felt kind of like a light greasy film on my face. After it dried sometimes my skin still felt a little dry and I&#x27;d apply a tiny bit more to certain areas.Tried this for about a week before I got tired of the greasy feeling it left both with and without makeup on top and went back to my old moisturizer (Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer 4/5 stars personally). Well after about two days using my old stuff which hasn&#x27;t given me any problems in months, I developed one of those horrible cystic zits next to the corner of my mouth. Next day, two more appeared one under my nose and one on my chin. I very rarely breakout anymore, (AcneFree face wash has kept me clear for a Long time with the occasional period breakout). The only thing that changed in my routine was this moisturizer, especially since neither my diet or schedule or anything else has changed at all. I can only guess that this is the cause. Between painful annoying breakouts, and the ineffectiveness of the product itself in controlling oil and being &amp;#34;mattifying&amp;#34; I will definitely not be trying or repurchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite daily moisturizer. After I wash my face, I apply this sunscreen every morning. I bought this as a replacement for my Elta MD daily sunscreen. It is way cheaper than Elta and does just as good of a job. It&#x27;s not too oily or greasy. Just a dab on my fingers spreads across my face and neck. I&#x27;m 24 now, but I hope that I&#x27;ll see the benefits down the road when I won&#x27;t have sunspots or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Feel comfortable putting it on my 2 and 6 years old. They also like it and do not make a fuss.&lt;br /&gt;totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly oily skin and the lotion with the face wash has been a god send. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like many other &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; lotions do and the smell is barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> This has a nice smell and is good for my oily skin.  It seems to do a good job controlling the oil.  It is light and not greasy.  I also appreciate the SPF.  I use this during the day and a heavier moisturizer at night.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;m 51, I still have oiliness issues with my skin!  I&#x27;ve tried several moisturizers, the last being Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free SPF15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Cetaphil product much better - glides on, smells great given that it has a SPF of 30, skin feels soft without residue.  Plus the packaging is great - ideal size, releases the lotion easily in just the right amount with one pump.</li>
    <li> As others have said, watch out for the eye area.  I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and I went just a little too close under my eyes and it made me break out in hives immediately.  I am more careful to apply it only as high as my cheekbones and only above my eyebrows.  It works super well.  It keeps the shine under control and makes my skin feel smooth and non-greasy.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like that this moisturizer feels light &amp; has spf but i did not feel that it did anything for my oiliness. I still really like since it does not have any pore clogging ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> has been use it for two years, very good, my doctor recommend it to me. I keep use it since then.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have very oily skin and cystic acne, so it has been difficult to find a product that keeps my skin in check.</li>
    <li> My skin is VERY oily, and it&#x27;s difficult to find a moisturizer, much less one with an SPF that won&#x27;t cause my skin to produce even more oil.  This absorbs quickly and definitely doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to become as greasy as all of the other SPF moisturizers out there, and there&#x27;s no white streaking, (which I absolutely hate).  I just wish it contained a stronger SPF.  I live in Colorado, and a 30-strength may be too low.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product, it does what it&#x27;s intended to do which is moisturize and protect you from the sun. It didn&#x27;t really control the oil on my face and as others have stated it will burn your eyes but not until the end of the day. Not super matte, I did still have a bit of a shine. Overall I probably won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin especially in the summer time and I have always had such sensitive skin and break out very easy! I was my face with a clean cetaphil cleanser and then use this and it definitely keeps my face from getting ridiculously oily.&lt;br /&gt;This has replaced my old moisturizer and I love it.</li>
    <li> It was so hard for me to find the right spf 30 .Finally my Daughter turn me on to this and from that day on its like pure Heaven.This is great!.No smell,No white resiude.Just a very good product.</li>
    <li> I really like Cetaphil products.  They are great for sensitive skin.  I use this for my arms, face, and neck when I am going outside on the weekends to garden, walk, etc.  If you sweat and have this on your forehead and this runs into your eyes, it hurts.  It also gets a little greasy which I don&#x27;t like but it does what you are using it for ... moisturizes and sun damage protection.</li>
    <li> Dont have much to say after that, haha pretty self explanatory. Offers spf 30 protection, moisturizes my skin and controls shine in my t -zone (specially around the nose) and has gentle ingredients that DONT BREAK ME OUT! wat more could you ask for! buy it! (: Thanks cetaphil.</li>
    <li> ...by totally caking it on your face. And, if you have oil issues any worse than the average person, it all goes out the window when this treatment is inevitably overwhelmed by your face&#x27;s oil production, making it feel even worse than it would have if you hadn&#x27;t used this moisturizer at all in the first place (although to be fair, it seems to slightly delay the onset of shine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitehead frequency is increased. I guess it&#x27;s because the oil is just dried out and stuck on there, helping to clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Fragrance free\\&quot; means nothing to cover up the sunscreen scent that is, in my opinion, not subtle but also not horrifically strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have any extraordinary oil problems, I could imagine this being a fantastic product. For people with actual issues of pronounced facial oil trying to address those issues, I do not recommend it. (As for me, I&#x27;m trying to treat an issue of oil production so bad that I have to wash 2-3 times/day in order to deal with it getting into my eyes and stinging, despite experimenting with diet and being many years past puberty.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I appreciate the moisturizer+SPF enough to continue to use it and wash it off soon after application if I&#x27;m out on a hot, sunny day.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent to my skin because it isn&#x27;t greasy. Love it! I recommend this product a lot. Try it</li>
    <li> I have a moisturizer that does same thing as Cetaphil ... all except claiming to help oily skin. I minus well stick to what i was using before ( in which i wont ) but im just saying... both products do same thing as the other product i was using, but cost wayyyy less !!! It did not help control my oil if anything it made me feel like i had more oil .. and i used very little moisturizer being as though its a lil thicker then i expected. Overall It did not work for me, maybe it will work for you though.</li>
    <li> I never post reviews but I love this lotion so much I wanted to spread the news! Some background on my skin routine: I use Differin (prescription) on my forehead to control acne and I wash every day (summer) or every other day (winter) with Clean &amp; Clear Sensitive Skin cleanser. This controls my acne but my skin is so uneven--oily forehead, dry eyelids/cheeks/chin/nose folds. It&#x27;s really frustrating! Clinique Dramatically Different Lotion is perfect EXCEPT it has no SPF so I&#x27;m going to damage my skin if I rely on that in the daytime. Every other SPF lotion I&#x27;ve tried is too heavy and they all make me break out...but NOT this one! Cetaphil&#x27;s lotion is *awesome.* I&#x27;ve been using Clinique DD at night and this Cetaphil in the morning and it is fantastic--it makes my skin feel lovely, I haven&#x27;t broken out after about 10 days of regular use (and some hormonal fluctuations), and I feel good about protecting my skin from the sun.</li>
    <li> I put this on at 11:25 am and by now, 1:45 pm, my forehead and nose are getting shiny from the oil. I guess my sebaceous glands are really active and no amount of mattifying oil control product can help that, but this product was not super mattifying in the first place. It is light and smells a bit like sunblock, and it actually stung very slightly when I first applied it. But it went away and my face felt dry enough for a bit... but like I said, it has not really helped with the oil control. Meh, I did not have super high hopes for it anyway. I am still going to use it because, well, I paid for it, and it was not too expensive. Best way of keeping out the UVB rays is to wear hats and other protective clothing, anyway.</li>
    <li> After it is on 1/2 day it begins to run a bit and into my eyes. Burns badly in the eyes and have to wipe it off. Won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> It spreads easily. Only a small amount is needed for the whole face (for the purpose of spreading, but not necessarily sufficient for SPF). My face doesn&#x27;t look very greasy after applying (better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used). After a year of using it, I no longer notice any bad smells.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin even more oily than what it already is and not only that it made my skin breakout so I was totally unhappy with it and ended up gifting it to a friend of mine who has normal-dry skin and at least she liked it.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. I don&#x27;t live in an overly sunny place. This did not cause me to break out as many spf infused lotions usually do.&lt;br /&gt;Use this sparingly when applying, a little goes a long way. I find that it is only the tiniest bit greasy, and depending on the humidity of the day, my face can sometimes be oily and shiny by the end of the day. But as I said if you use a small amount, this product will go on pretty matte and stay matte depending on the weather.</li>
    <li> Feels way too oily on my skin. It&#x27;s supposed to control the oil on my skin, not make my skin look oily. What the hell?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away if you&#x27;re not looking for that greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> BEST FACE LOTION WITH SHINE FREE AND SUN SCREEN</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I just wish they sold it in a bigger package.  It is light weight, gentle, no smell.  It was recommended by my dermatologist and I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! the best for oily skin! Cheaper than any other store, fast shipping,</li>
    <li> After applying on my face, when I sweat it burns my eyes, even after I had tried to wash it out. Unfortunately, I will not use anymore.</li>
    <li> Perfect as a moisturizer before makeup</li>
    <li> I was expecting a matte finish and I didn&#x27;t get one. I&#x27;ll continue to search for a better oil free moisturizer with spf that doesn&#x27;t leave me shiny.</li>
    <li> Good product not oily at all.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product for my acne prone skin. An oil control moisturizer with spf - it does the job!</li>
    <li> doesnt feel greasy. my pimples scars are less red after applying. but I cant give it 5 stars because I am not seeing lesser outbreaks.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Has not worsened acne.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice pump packaging keeps it sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Still makes me look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t get it near eyes - burns a lot.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin but I wanted something to help keep my glasses (made of acetate) from sliding off my face, a problem I experienced with the cetaphil fragrance free SPF 15 moisturizer (which I loved and used for years). This absorbs fast &amp; leaves my skin feeling less &amp;#34;oily.&amp;#34; So far, I&#x27;m seeing the difference I was hoping to experience. It makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two caveats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It has a noticeably strong odor. It&#x27;s fragrance free so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s some other chemical that gives off that smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You&#x27;ll learn to stop touching your eyes with your bare hands because if any of this lotion gets in your eye, it burns like hell. So you can stop touching your eyes or at least use a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works well and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I needed a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t break out my acne prone skin. I use a lot of products with glycolic acid in it and they tend to dry my skin. My skin is no longer dry, but on hot days, I have to use sparingly. My T zone area was oily within a few hours. Now that I have adjusted the amount to use in the summer, I am not as oily.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! Just perfect for my skin type, and it even has sunscreen protection!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have combo dry/oily skin, but the dryness is only a problem right after I shower. After that I have to fight off the oil for the rest of the day. I like this Cetaphil moisturizer mostly because of the SPF. It&#x27;s 30 which I was afraid to buy because I figured it might be thick and gross. On the contrary, it goes on very smooth and there is no scent whatsoever which is a huge plus. On the downside, it states in big letters, right on the front: Oil Control. Sorry, but nope. By noon you can cook an egg on my face. It does nothing to control the oil and I&#x27;ve been using this for close to 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a decent size and should last a while and the pump is always nice. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and again, no nasty smell. But it really isn&#x27;t for people who mostly have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; moisturizer and sun block. My dermatologist told me I should be wearing 30 SPF on a daily basis. Most of the other creams I found were 15, this is 30. It goes one without the oiliness of other creams, light with almost no fragrance. The only complain I have is that when it is warm and you sweat, the cream is not waterproof, so if it gets in your eyes, it stings.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer for acne prone skin</li>
    <li> very light. I usually dislike sunscreen because they feel heavy/greasy. This one is very light.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> great for my dry face</li>
    <li> This seemed more like a sunscreen lotion, rather then a moisturizer. If you want actual moisture, i would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The amount in the bottle lasts a long time as you only need a pump or two to clean your face. I have sensitive yet oily skin and really like the effect I get from this product.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  I live in a hot/humid climate and it&#x27;s not too much. I thought I was just buying one- but I reviewed two!</li>
    <li> Now, I won&#x27;t say this product might not be great for a lot of folks but if you have sensitive skin like me, it might not be the best choice.  I have oily skin but it is also rather sensitive, although usually not overly so.  I tend to not have a problem with the moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, even when perfumed etc.  Usually it is soaps that I&#x27;m sensitive too, but I guess there is always the odd exception.  I bought this the other night after hearing great things about it.  I washed my face as I usually would and put this lotion on after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was moderately pleased.  My skin did feel ok to the touch, admittedly more dewy than I&#x27;d hoped, but I&#x27;ll take dewy over oily any day.  I&#x27;d say it was about an hour later when my skin started to not feel so great.  On top of that, I had put the lotion near-ish to my eyes which is no different than any other lotion I&#x27;ve applied (did not get the product in my eye at all).  So now at the same time that my skin is feeling a bit warm and irritated my eyes were starting to REALLY bother me.  I went to check out the situation in the mirror and my face was slightly pink and my one eye in particular completely bloodshot to hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed the product off immediately and did what I could for my eye.  My skin was still pinkish red the next day and my eyes incredibly sore.  After about 36 hours now my face and eyes are pretty much  back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a reaction like this with other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  I am wondering if it might have something to do with the sunscreen ingredients as certain brands of sunscreen sometimes bother me in a similar way, although not so extreme.  Either way, if you have sensitive skin I&#x27;d recommend putting a test bit on the edge of your face first and make sure you have no reaction before you slather the stuff on.</li>
    <li> I purchased Cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizing lotion but had to return it as it left my face so greasy. I decided to try this one instead and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s very light and absorbs into the skin quickly. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my face isn&#x27;t as oily as usual by the afternoon.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer for it&#x27;s SPF rating and to help reduce/eradicate my mild acne with the Dermacontrol Foam Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the wash, this moisturizer goes a long way. A pea-size is too much!!!! Gives skin an okay glow/sheen - I don&#x27;t wear any make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I see significant positive changes in my skin I&#x27;ll upgrade to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a week for try skin around the mouth and chin area and I get more acnes than before.  I stopped using it and the acnes went away.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product based on another reviewer saying he/she has oily skin and it helps.  Obviously that person&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t as oily as mine. My wife had previously found me a different brand that does a bit better, not sure if its fair to advertise it here.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, keep shopping.  Also, my wife and I tried this product on an aggressive hike.  With sweat, this product will bleed into your eyes and sting like crazy.  We will likely downgrade this to a body sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Do NOT use this product if you have sensitive skin or possible allergies. It contains 3 chemicals known to have a high incidence of allergic reaction and right now I am on day four of burning, bright red hives on my face and neck. Unfortunately, I did not check the ingredients before applying and it has ruined my vacation. Go to Environmental Working Group&#x27;s 2014 sunscreen guidelines: http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/best-sunscreens/best-beach-sport-sunscreens/</li>
    <li> Excellent simple moisturizer with a great SPF. Goes on thinly, and does not give you a pale face. Whiteness disappears in a few seconds. Not thick.  Has oil-absorbing properties, which is great for acneic skin. Recommended by my dermatologist. I use this with other skincare products.</li>
    <li> My skin tends to be oily - this helps control breakouts and keeps my face less oily, too!</li>
    <li> Bought this at CVS a year ago for my oily skin. Works great. Good price on Amazon. Great addition to my Cetaphil routine.</li>
    <li> I have a teenager who uses lots of prescription acne medications, which can dry out his skin.  We were using another facial moisturizer, which only made his face more oily.  This one truly absorbs oil and keeps his skin balanced with the harsh medications.</li>
    <li> I really like that this moisturizer keeps my face from being so dry. I also love that this product includes sunscreen, but the problem is that it smells exactly like sunscreen! I wish that scent wasn&#x27;t so strong--I may as well use real sunscreen if that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to smell like!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product. Just don&#x27;t rub your eyes while its on your face. That s*** feels like acid when it gets in your eye.</li>
    <li> this is the best .  I use it every day rain or shine.  My Dermatologies recommended this and I have been using it now for 5 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the coordinating face wash.  My face was dry beyond belief after using the two together.  Naturally, I thought it was the face wash that was drying my skin, but one day I decided not to use this moisturizer and instead use my Cerave moisturizer, and my skin was perfect.  this moisturizer burns my skin and burns my eye area (I am used to using a moisturizer that I can slap over my entire face including the eye area). In addition, after applying I still felt my skin was dry.  It&#x27;s winter time and my skin is more dry than in the warmer months.  I am on medication for adult acne (Tazorac gel and Aczone gel), and I have combination skin.  I have an oily T-zone but normal to dry cheek and eye area.  I usually use Bare Escentuals moisturizer for normal to dry skin.  I have found that if I apply my Cerave moisturizer first then apply this on top I get the level of moisturization that I need.  I will continue to use this because my dermatologist recommended I use SPF 30 or higher when not wearing Bare Minerals makeup (that has SPF 25) because I am getting hypigmentation on my face.  she specifically recommended this brand because of the oil control properties.  I am guessing I will like it a little better in the summer months.  In short, I love the cleanser, but the moisturizer........I could do without it.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S OILY AND DOESN&#x27;T SERVE ITS PURPOSE. MY SKIN IS SHINY 2 SECONDS AFTER APPLYING IT.&lt;br /&gt;WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really needed a good mositurizer with spf, this ones not too great, the fragrance is not good, Its oily but ironically doesn&#x27;t help reduce the dryness</li>
    <li> This thing irritates my eyes so badly and makes my skin so red. I have used it for 3 months and it was hell</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is decent with oil control. However, it burns my eyes even when I try to keep it away from them while applying. Olay fresh effects (soak up the sun SPF 15) works much better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I chose this because it is not supposed to contain harmful chemicals like most sun protection.  It has a mild but not very pleasant smell.  It seems to work well as a daily sun protective lotion.  Good for men and children.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the sun protection and because it is oil free - I was looking to replace a very expensive oil free +spf lotion from Boscia (oil free daily hydration spf 15). It is great replacement at a fraction of the cost and has a higher spf. It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to breakout nor does it contribute to the oiliness of my skin - which other moisturizers tend to do.</li>
    <li> NICE AND LIGHT BUT DOES IT&#x27;S JOB.  I HAVE AN OILY T-ZONE AND CAN&#x27;T STAND IT WHEN HALF WAY THROUGH THE DAY I HAVE TO BLOT THE AREA BECAUSE IT BECOMES SO SHINY.  NOT WITH THE CETAPHIL, AND THE SPF IS A BONUS STEP ALREADY APPLIED BEFORE I LEAVE THE HOUSE.</li>
    <li> Its a good moisturizer to use and i would probably continue to use it after. It was definitely worth ordering,</li>
    <li> I really like the face wash in the same line as this moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and I will breakout if you look at me the wrong way! I introduced this moisturizer slowly...first forehead, then a part of a cheek, then chin...and so on. I didn&#x27;t breakout at all! My only complaint is that it makes my skin red and shiny. When I wake up in the morning I wash with the Dermacontrol wash and my face looks fantastic minus a few pimples, but my skin isn&#x27;t red and any scarring is not noticeable and no shine. Then as soon as I put even the tiniest amount of this moisturizer on my face is very red and uneven...and very shiny.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has acne prone skin and uses topical medication for acne, she needed an SPF 30 for the daytime and I have been using this everyday too.  It controls oil and keeps makeup looking fresh.  We both really like it.</li>
    <li> I buy Cetaphil brand lotion because it gets the job done without any fuss.  I was however expecting this to not have that sunscreen odor that all sunscreens have.  Unfortunately, it does have that smell which bothers me.  Thinking about returning it, not sure.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me break out and protects my skin. Amazing.</li>
    <li> First time I used this I could tell a difference. No oily feel or look. Keeps my skin looking fresh.</li>
    <li> Good protection and feel for the face.  Works well under makeup and doesn&#x27;t increase the shine factor.  I don&#x27;t use it for preparing for outdoor sports because it doesn&#x27;t have the sweat resistance factor, but it is my go to face sunscreen for every day use.</li>
    <li> After one application, my skin immediately dried out and turned red. I&#x27;m used to Cetaphil brand products being pretty mild, so this was a bit of a shock for me.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer. I believe it is helping my oil problem go down. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the SPF</li>
    <li> Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> easy to use and very effective</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for your face, not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I should have realized that &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; are two phrases that contradict each other.  I&#x27;m a guy with oily skin but I wanted to find a way to get SPF protection during the day.  This product may very well be a better option than straight up sunscreen for those with oily skin, but make no mistake, if you have oily skin and you put this stuff on in the morning,  THE SHINE will be out in full force in a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this if going out to the pool or enjoying the outdoors, but for an everyday option for SPF protection, save yourself the headache and don&#x27;t buy if you have oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the Dermacontrol foaming face wash seems to work pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is a really good moisturizer and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t make me break out to use it. It soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel all greasy afterwards. The added SPF is nice too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it works well for my skin I hear it does for others. My dermatologist requested I try it so I did.</li>
    <li> Feels nice going on, but I still broke out in a few pimples.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty cool moisturizer &amp;#34;package.&amp;#34; It is a sunscreen, moisturizer, and oil controller, all in one. I used it in the morning before going outside for a while but it has a strange tingling/tightening sensation on your face, and the ingredients worry me for some reason (haven&#x27;t looked into them though). I&#x27;m not sure if this product is actually harmful but I just don&#x27;t want to use it any more and will be looking for something natural. However, the product does work, so if you don&#x27;t mind using a chemical-feeling product on your face and need something that will help you to control oily skin or be non-irritating, I recommend that you buy this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. Very greasy.  it is not oil control at all.  My face has been greasy the entire day after I put this on.</li>
    <li> My skin appears more oily than without this product&lt;br /&gt;It causes eye irritation (even though product wasn&#x27;t applied near eye lids)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s saving my skin from sun damage so I continue using it</li>
    <li> Even tho it says for sensitivity skin my face gets a little itchy, but it arrives on time so think cetaphil should review it&#x27;s formula.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, and this moisturizer works really well.  I use it everyday and not only does it help control my oily skin, it keeps my face from drying out, especially in the winter.  I would definitily recommend.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because I have a serious oily skin problem. This didnt help keep the oil at bay at all BUT it has made my skin stay clear. It&#x27;s gentle, scentless, smooth... but doesn&#x27;t help with my oil problem at all. Now I&#x27;m looking for a primer that might help with this.</li>
    <li> just what the Dr. said to get</li>
    <li> I have fought with mild acne since I was a teenager.  I can keep it at bay with Stridex wipes and washing my face twice daily, but I&#x27;m always on the line between dry skin and super oily skin.  I love this moisturizer, in fact it is perfect for summer because even if you sweat a bit it mattifies and prevents your face from appearing so shiny.  Great for guys like myself who would be self conscious using powder makeup for a similar effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it has sunscreen makes it 100x better.  This is the best sunscreen moisturizer I have found for my face, I just hope Cetaphil continues making it.</li>
    <li> not greasy, keeps my skin hydrated. recommended.</li>
    <li> It is not greasy and provides some moisture to you skin while allowing some protection from the sun. It does seem to melt away with sweat so if you sweat you can be sure to lose your protection. Even on my arms it did not seem to stay.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this since it is not greasy I thought it would be good for summer with the matte finish and light weight protection but it just doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very liquid and not creamy as most hand creams and body creams.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin, so I bought this product mainly because it claims to manage that. Well... For me, I haven&#x27;t really seen a change in my skin&#x27;s oiliness after using this moisturizer for nearly a month. I still have to use oil absorbing sheets to blot my face when I&#x27;m out, which is fine, because I&#x27;ve been doing that already. Maybe it works better if you use it in conjunction with the Dermacontrol Cleanser? I don&#x27;t know because I use a different cleanser that has been working really well with my skin in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as some of the other reviewers stated, this moisturizer is more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer. In fact, if you look on the packaging, it lists the key ingredients&#x27; purpose as \\&quot;sunscreen.\\&quot; (Avobenzone, Octisalate, &amp; Octocrylene, for those who want to know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good sunscreen. Not too greasy. Dries fast. But, it is not much of an oil controller.</li>
    <li> I liked this moisturizer well enough, but it took a long time to absorb, and I was breaking out more while I was using it. This may have been a coincidence -- possibly an interaction with another product -- but I eventually decided to put this one away for a while and go back to my Aveeno moisturizer for the time being. This one can be a back-up in case I run out of the Aveeno, when I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in the packaging as shown in the picture. First of all, I&#x27;m surprised that there isn&#x27;t a cap for this bottle or any sort of protection throughout the shipping process. More importantly, this wastes some of the product that I paid money for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself goes, the lotion is very good and works as advertised. This is the only reason I&#x27;m not rating Cetaphil&#x27;s wash one out of five stars.</li>
    <li> I usually use cetaphil lotion that comes in a jar and thought I&#x27;d try this one with sunblock for summer... Nope. Makes me breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you can smell and taste the sunblock in this. Find another.</li>
    <li> very good product! worth it!</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and this lotion did not sting, but I have a breakout whenever I use it. So it sits in the cabinet.....</li>
    <li> Ok face lotion, but it burns like crazy if it gets in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m continually impressed by the quality of many drugstore products and this is no exception.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 30 and it does a really good job of keeping my oily skin under control, which is no small task in the summer.</li>
    <li> Works well! Thanks Bear</li>
    <li> My wife is using this, she is very happy with the product. Unlike other brand of sun-screen, acne has not appear on her forehead since she started using few months back. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best oil free, SPF 30 moisturizer I have found.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product for people who are prone to dry/cracked skin. Especially those with eczema. It made my skin incredibly dry and flakey and caused a flare up with my eczema (which I usually keep under control). I was better off using nothing! I&#x27;m sure it works well for others, just not for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Great product, it does not burn your eyes if you rub it around the corners, might just be me though. no smell and feels just a sun screen but also keeps my face moist.</li>
    <li> Every other UVA/UVB moisturizer/sunscreen has caused awful breakouts and tends to be very white, almost like theatrical make-up, but not this one!  It&#x27;s perfect and my acne has even improved a lot since I started using it.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use this product almost daily and I should use it everyday.  I use it immediately after shaving as a daily moisturizer and it works extremely well. Why only 4 stars? My one downside is that when I have used this in warm climates and then work out I sweat and when it gets in my eyes, they sting more than other products that I have used.  So while I think this is great for everyday use, I would wait to apply until after a workout.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have oily T zone but dry cheeks. I also needed a sunscreen for my face. This stuff is like grease! The kind you fry french fries in. It&#x27;s greasier than cheap sunscreen, it&#x27;s irritating, and in stings your eyes if you sweat. It&#x27;s awful! I wish I could get my money back</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve hit my mid twenties my skin has become an oil slick. My makeup wouldn&#x27;t stay on and I had this awful oily complextion. I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy a prouduct that might help calm my skin down but with so many proudcuts to choose from I had no idea where to start. I bought this on a whim because it was low cost and the label said it was for oily/acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve only used it once at 8 this moring, here it is 5 in the afternoon...my skin has no oil to be found!!! I&#x27;m amazed becuase I figured at best it would help for a few hours but man I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I am extremely budget conscious but decided to cave and purchase this moisturizer because I was interested in better controlling my oily skin.  I get oily all over and break out often.  I also struggle with hyperpigmentation so a high SPF is essential.  I notice that using this in combo with the oil control cleanser has helped control the oil on my skin significantly.  I tried it with another cleanser and I noticed my skin was still oily so having an oil control cleaner makes a huge difference.  It feels like other moisturizers in that it is silky but not watery.  It dries fairly quickly but does not have a matte finish.  I have worn this after cleansing with the oil control cleanser and my skin is still oil free hours later.  When I wear this under my makeup I have noticed less oil throughout the day when I blot and look in the mirror.  It did not irritate my skin and my pores do not seem larger.  I think this will be my go to from now on.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using neutrogena for years and recently it has started to sting a little. After doing a little research I came across this and decided it was time to change my lotion.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and I love it. Doesn&#x27;t sting, doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy, moisturizes really well. Love it.</li>
    <li> I use Cetaphil face wash, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this moisturizer. It was a little too thin for my liking, and I think my skin is too sensitive for this particular formula.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  Used it exclusively on my face while recently in Cancun and The Outer Banks of North Carolina.  Skin did not burn and was kept from drying out.  Works great under makeup as well.  Skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t control shine for me. I&#x27;ve been getting more breakouts, which could be caused by the lotion or by my not using a lotion that markets more towards preventing breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. This product made me break out in whiteheads all over my forehead! I&#x27;m switching back to my old moisturizer. I&#x27;m disappointed because I hoped I&#x27;d found something moisturizing with sunscreen. I also second the other reviews that pointed out it&#x27;s oily and does not have a matte finish-- I&#x27;d put makeup and powder on my face and it would work for a few hours, then I&#x27;d get shiny.</li>
    <li> Great cover without being oily or heavy. Best facial lotion for use during the day that I&#x27;ve ever used. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been on a hunt for a perfect moisturizer for years now after my beloved face lotion was discontinued. My skin gets very oily and every other drug store lotion I&#x27;ve tried gets very heavy and shiny after a couple hours of wear (not to mention makes my makeup feel like a blanket on my face...not cute). Anyway, after reading positive reviews for this product I decided to give it a go and I am so happy I did! I must say it does smell a little funky, but you get used to it after a few wears. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 3 months now and I absolutely love it! I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more as a low priced moisturizer for oily, acne prone skin. And with SPF 30, what more could you ask for?! Two big thumbs up in my *very critical* book!</li>
    <li> I find many Cetaphil products helpful so I was excited to find this one.  I have oily skin and was pleased to find SPF30.  This product did not work for me, though, because though I do not have particularly sensitive skin, it obviously contains something I reacted to.  Like others have experienced my skin and eyes really burned and reacted.  Thanks to others&#x27; helpful comments I see that there are some ingredients to be avoided and I&#x27;ll search for a new daily moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good one for years. It&#x27;s very hard to find one for oily skin especially.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for keeping your face moist.</li>
    <li> I just got this a couple days ago, and so far I like it.  I perhaps haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if my face will break out from it yet, however it seems nice and light and smells half decent.  I really like the pump.  And it isn&#x27;t oily which sometimes happens with sunscreens. It kind of sinks into the skin and makes my face feel kind of soft.  It&#x27;s not a total matte finish, but it still looks pretty good.  I still had oil later in the day, but I have really oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I guess that what got me thinking about a moisturizer was that I went into the dermatologist.  I didn&#x27;t have makeup on and I had just washed my face.  And she said that my skin was actually somewhat dry (in between oil outbreaks) and sensitive. And she said to use a low strength Benzoyl Peroxide wash and to put moisturizer on afterwards, and also gave me an rx for Spironolactone (which she said might take 4 months to work). Just for women&#x27;s hormonal acne.  So I guess that I&#x27;ll see if any of this really works.  I&#x27;d really like not to have to wear foundation (although powder would be ok) and to have clearer, less oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An extra comment-after using this product for a couple days is that I&#x27;ve decided not to use it directly around the eye area.  I had irritated eyes one night and I think that I might have gotten some of this into my eyes. So I&#x27;m going to use special eye area moisturizer. I don&#x27;t mind so much cause I already use a special soap for the eye area and it&#x27;s a different type of skin.</li>
    <li> I am 21 years old and have always battled light to moderate acne and oily skin. I am also constantly in the sun surfing, swimming, doing outdoors types of things. This product has worked really well controlling the oil, dry skin after using acne wash products that tend to dry out the face, and providing SPF 30 all in one lotion. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Burns my eyes even when I avoid my eye area not a fan it just sits in the closet and wasn&#x27;t very matte</li>
    <li> Finally a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or look like an oil slick. I got a sample from my dermatologist and liked it so I bought the full size. Love it to use with my retin-a.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few months now and although it moisturizes well, it seems to irritate my skin (makes it red) and it doesn&#x27;t do enough to control oil.  It may work for someone with less sensitive skin, but be careful around your eyes, as this product stings.  I will be looking for an alternative when I finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin so those of you who do I wouldn&#x27;t advise purchasing this. I wanted to love it because I use Cetaphil Skin Cleanser and it does wonders for my skin but as soon as I put this on my face started BURNING. I had to take it off immediately. It was a huge waste of money and didn&#x27;t feel like messing with returns so I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> I am an end user. I was sold from the good reviews but was extremely unhappy about this product after using it. Since it claim to be oil control and normally that meant for face right? So I bought 3 bottles on sale. After apply it. My eyes started burning when the sweat and the oil get into my eyes. It was a painful and bad experience as I was driving when it happened. I had a near accident because I couldnt open my eye. I stopped my car to look for water to rinse it off. But water rinsing isn&#x27;t good enough I had to buy soap from a nearby store to get rid of this burning sensation. Now I have to discard all 3 bottles. Just be careful. If you need this for your body or arm and legs maybe that&#x27;s ok but not on your face as it may burn your eye.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. it does moisturize the skin and makes it look very good.</li>
    <li> Works well for my oily skin!</li>
    <li> no for sensitive skin,this sunscreen once you put on you face and the Sun is shinning, it will sting your eyes Horrible&lt;br /&gt;stay away&lt;br /&gt;Dioxide Titanium and Zinc Oxide are Best mineral Sunscreen look fir them</li>
    <li> This is a good product, have been using it for a couple of weeks now. It does help with oil-control on my shaved head and forehead for a good 3-4 hrs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect because have sun protection</li>
    <li> Good stuff, but it will dry out your skin. It&#x27;s good for mattifying.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. I wanted something that would sooth, not break out my skin, as well as be a good spf. Instead, this promptly caused a breakout. I did not use it in combination with anything else new, nor had I had any significant break outs in some time, so I feel comfortable saying this was the cause.</li>
    <li> it smells like a regular beach sunscreen and it actually makes my skin look and feel even more oily... but i think deep down it does the right job</li>
    <li> My 13 year old has severe acne. He has to go through 4 acne regimens before he can qualify for Acutane.&lt;br /&gt;He uses 2 antibiotic topical creams and has to take the antibiotic capsule Doxycicline hyclate twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;His dermatologist gave him this moisturizer to help prevent over drying after all of his acne meds. It also helps with the oil control (shiny face) and protects from high risk of sunburn which is caused by the meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 45 yrs old and I use it as a daytime cream/sunscreen protection since I still have the combination \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone areas on my face. I can still get acne breakouts if I use heavy face cream (anti-aging) but my skin stays ballanced with this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I don&#x27;t have blackhead issues anymore. It helps with smooth make-up application, too.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product doesn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> I purchased this last month - along with the[[ASIN:B002MSN3QQ Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.]] and [[ASIN:B002CML1XE La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid for Face, 1.7-Ounce Bottle]] - and I&#x27;d have to say it is definitely my favorite sunscreen. I use it every morning when i wake up before I put on my makeup. I did not have any problems with having it under my makeup - like I did with the Elta MD sunscreen - and it seemed like this helped as a base. I&#x27;m going to have to say that it only helped a little bit with the oiliness of my skin because it did not completely mattify my face and my skin felt a little bit oily by the end of the day. There&#x27;s no weird sunscreen smell and it was great for moisturizing my face! Best of all, it did not break out my sensitive skin. I will definitely be repurchasing this when I run out.</li>
    <li> Light weight moisturizer that doesn’t feel initially greasy on the skin. But it does NOTHING to control or prevent excess oil from building up on my face. I still use it because I don’t want it to go to waste but I would not repurchase. Doesn’t really do what it’s promised.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have oily skin and need a moisturizer that does the job while alleviating the oil. It&#x27;s light and non-greasy even with having SPF which isn&#x27;t always easy to find. However I still use the same amount of oil sheets on my face throughout the day...level of oiliness didn&#x27;t change one bit. Bummer!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended it and gave me samples...this new kind is oil free and as not as heavy...I like it and I wear it daily...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended the acne foaming facial wash by Cetaphil, so I tried this moisturizer--it works well! Easily dispenses and does not cause any rash. It is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen/moisturizer daily and have never had an issue with burning which is really important to me.  Has great moisturizing properties from what you&#x27;d expect from a facial moisturizer but also provides your skin with additional spf protection.  The only downside is if you get this in your eyes it will burn pretty bad.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I will have to give a later update on this product</li>
    <li> I use this every morning on my face and neck before my commute to work, because even while driving in the car you can still get tanned or get more sun exposure than you should. It is easy to spread around, might be a bit greasy but I&#x27;m ok with that (I use coconut oil on my face sometimes).</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light oil free moisterizer.  I have extremely oily skin.  This if very thick and hard to rub in.  Leaves a shine on your skin also.  I tried this because the Murad oil control mattifier is so expensive.  I went back to Murad!  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> So lightweight and goes on smoothly. Love that it has spf protection. As for the oil control, I think it actually works and my skin feels moisturized. Doesn&#x27;t have that chalky film and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast, especially for darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> non-greasy  7 doesn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  Good for acne prone skin. My son  love it except a little more expensive.</li>
    <li> I just got this stuff today, I applied it on my face after washed it, and here is what i think:&lt;br /&gt;- This stuff look oily, i mean after i wash my face it&#x27;s look dry/clean and no oil, but when i put this stuff on it make it look like my oily face before wash.&lt;br /&gt;- I saw a lot of complain about this stuff will burn your eyes, so i try to applied close to my eyes ( not too close, but kinda like a panda circle close) and it DID NOT burn my skin or my EYES. So for those of you who wonder if this stuff will burn your eyes i guess it&#x27;s depend and it&#x27;s not happens to everyone. or people just rub their eyes and got it in their eyes idk because this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem like it would burn like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: It only been few hour since i put it on my face everything seem pretty normal, but i&#x27;ll update if this stuff actually reduce oil and break out and all that stuff in a few day ( maybe a week idk)</li>
    <li> i used to love this but i think after this last bottle i&#x27;m moving on. its good for winter but i find its just too heavy for summer and spring. it leaves that &#x27;filmy&amp;#34; feeling on your skin and if you touch your skin it &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; off. i do like how high the spf is.</li>
    <li> This stings my face when I put it on. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Works great, as described. Keeps my oily skin under control and I have noticed much less break outs.</li>
    <li> great for daily use, but i do use moisturizer before putting this on, as i do have quite dry skin. also go light on forehead as it does shine later..</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer because it supposedly prevents acne (I haven&#x27;t broken out since using it, and have been using it for a few months).  However, it does have a strong sunscreen scent, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to control oil very much.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference in shininess on my face between this product and any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The SPF I&#x27;m sure is a great thing. But I do NOT want my moisturizer smelling like sunscreen. My husband has very sensitive skin, he doesn&#x27;t really like it. If you are looking for a sunscreen that may not dry you out, this may be the product for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my regular face moisturizer. Feels light on my oily skin and moisturizes well under all my makeup. The 30 SPF protects without feeling too pasty. Cetaphyl is gentle on sensitive skin. Love that it&#x27;s fragrance free. Well priced because this bottle lasts a long time for me.</li>
    <li> Impossible to find in stores. My dermatologist recommended this product as the skin on my face gets dry immediately out of the shower, but as the day goes on gets a bit oily. This product moisturizes in the morning and keeps me oil free, just like it says!</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this facial moisturizer.  It keeps my face from becoming oily and also has kept the sun at bay.  I use it daily and have taken it as far as Tibet (and we did not even burn in the high altitude sun).  I will continue to buy this and love that the SPF is 30!</li>
    <li> Calms my skin after using Epiduo for my acne. My skin feels very smooth afterwards</li>
    <li> I am not going to write a whole lot about this product, but I will say that it is a great moisturizer.  I workout a few times a day and have oily skin.  The constant showers and conditions where I live dictate that I have to use moisturizer on my face multiple times per day.  This is by far the best \\&quot;matte\\&quot; moisturizer I have used.  It works leaps and bounds better than the normal cetaphil moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I had pretty low hopes for this stuff, even though I love Cetaphil and have been using their normal lotion for years.  I got this because my skin is definitely towards the oilier side of the spectrum, and the normal lotion was giving me a sheen that I couldn&#x27;t control with just powder.  Long story short, this stuff is AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that promise to do the same thing, some made by much more expensive brands like Chanel and various Sephora products.  This stuff beats them all out by a mile.  I use it on my face after every time I wash.  It feels light and leaves a matte finish all day long.  On top of that, it seems to have improved my complexion, as well - I haven&#x27;t broken out in weeks.  And it has SPF!  What more could you ask for?  I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff highly enough.</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly for my skin. I totally recommend it for people who have skin prone to acne. And also for the SPF 30.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Does not leave a greasy residue. My 15 year old daughter is now using this as well and loves it!</li>
    <li> I did not buy this lotion from Amazon but I thought I would review it anyways. I have quite oily skin and I occasional get acne breakouts. I use generic acne face wash and it makes my face quite dry, therefore I put on lotion afterwards. The lotion I used was not for acne-prone skin so it made my face really shiny and clogged up my pores leading to acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I researched lotion for acne-prone skin and I found this Cetaphil Dermacontrol for acne-prone skin while leaving a matte-look. I did my regular routine of washing my face and applied this lotion. I found that it did leave a non-shiny  look and so far has not caused any breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you that if you have very dry skin or use any topical acne treatments, this lotion may burn when you apply it and it could cause redness. I have not experienced this but I have heard of some people having this issue.&lt;br /&gt;You do not need a lot of lotion for when you apply it on your face. If you use too much it may cause your skin to look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I recommend this moisturizer if you easly breakout and don&#x27;t mind spending 15 bucks on a four ounce bottle...</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use after I did a home peel. I bought it because it was not supposed to have any fragrance and it was supposed to be gentle. It was recommended to use with peels. DON&#x27;T USE THIS WITH SKIN PEELS and DO NOT get this product anywhere near your eyes. Even near your cheekbones is too close. It burns!! The scent is strong and smells just like sunscreen. When you get sunscreen in your eyes it burns so bad- this is the same thing so I am not buying that it is anything more than sunscreen. I used it the first time after my peel and it literally burned my face. I do not have sensitive skin so this must be a strong product.</li>
    <li> Greasy, and over time ran into my eyes and burned:(</li>
    <li> This works really well for about 2-3 hours.  I have really oily skin so after that you need to apply more to keep oil under control.</li>
    <li> Works but leaves my fave a bit greasy. Overall it has the SPF I need in it so I keep using it.</li>
    <li> my wife got this for acne control. This really helped her out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but what was this supposed to do? Control oil? Could&#x27;ve foolded me. My skin has never been so oily. It mattifies for like...the first 5 minutes. After that, back to the grease ball. I hate to say it, peeps. But there isn&#x27;t a cure for oily skin. Let&#x27;s just suck it up and deal with it. No sense in wasting money on one worthless product after another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only pro is the sunscreen. That was enough to give it two stars. However, when it gets in my eyes, it feels like soap! Back to one star.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good face moisturizer for a while, as I have oily skin and it&#x27;s very important that I find an oil-free, effective face lotion. This product had gotten good reviews, and the brand was supposedly very respected. When I ordered the product, I had thought it was a moisturizer that happened to also be SPF 30 as an added bonus, but I was very wrong. This product quite honestly just feels like just pure sunscreen, both color-wise and texture-wise. It made my face greasy and didn&#x27;t rub in as lotion usually does. I would definitely not recommend it, especially for those who are prone to oily skin and don&#x27;t care for that very thin layer of grease on their faces.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is rated well on the Environmental Working Group website (http://www.ewg.org/), but I think due to the ingredients making it SPF 30, it would burn if I accidentally rubbed my eyes and the sting would last a while. The moisturizer isn&#x27;t scented, but it does provide oil control.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I put it on right before my makeup, and I can not even tell that it is on!</li>
    <li> skin type: combination&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a very avid sunscreen user but have acne prone skin. I needed something that will not only help protect my skin but will not break me out which alot of moisturizers with spf do to my skin.This does not clog my pores and does what it says. I use my Lush moisturizer and layer this on top for sun protection.</li>
    <li> I can wear this sunscreen/moisturizer all day without it aggravating my acne or clogging my pores. This is the only product of its kind that I have found that doesn&#x27;t make me break out terribly and it protects me from the harsh Colorado sun.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now along with the Dermacontrol cleanser and I have noticed a significant reduction in oil. I did try to 50 spf Moisturizer but that left my face extremely oily and broke my skin out. Also, the gentle cleanser that had worked so well just was not working any more, probably because my skin just suddenly changed. This has worked wonders.  It is not greasy at all and doesn&#x27;t break the skin out.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It iis specifically indicated for people with oily skin. Those people don&#x27;t need a moisturizer. People like me with dry, sensitive skin spend their money in moisturizers. At least this is what I think. Next time I will research. I use their product to wash my face. It is excellent. I&#x27;ll have to do more research.</li>
    <li> The scent of this is hardly noticeable to me and I am very sensitive to scents, especially when they are on the face.  It goes on with a matte finish and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling sticky or wet forever like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I am using it with the Oil Control Foam Wash and I definitely notice a difference in the oil on my face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a really bad complexion, but I&#x27;ve had several skin cancers, and they certainly don&#x27;t look good being treated and then healing.  I asked my dermatologist if he could recommend anything to use on my face and he said that this won&#x27;t stop skin cancers (that I caused myself when as a teenager I went to the beach at the mention of the word - beach), but that it is a great moisturizer along with good sun protection in it.  He said to put it on every time I was going to spend any time outside, even for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I do, and small skin inconsistencies are becoming less and less noticeable and if I weren&#x27;t so old, I might even be attractive!</li>
    <li> It feels a little thick and leaves whitish tone right after applying it on your face, which disappears quickly. Given the price I think this is a good SPF lotion that you can use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> does the job..smoothe your skin and helps with the UV&lt;br /&gt;protections.  Use when you are going to be out in the sun!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. It keeps my face moisturized but non-greasy the entire day. Which is amazing. I&#x27;ve been constantly greasy since I arrived in Florida. It&#x27;s hot and humid here and could not control the oiliness. I would wash my face and walk outside for 10 mins, and arrive as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my face for a week. Since using this product, I have yet to hear the dreaded \\&quot;you&#x27;re face is shiny\\&quot;. I used to get that comment almost every day.</li>
    <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> so far so good and a little bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I use, day and night. I do really love how well it absorbs in while still giving SPF protection. However it will burn your eyes if you get lotion in them and it tends to make the sides of my mouth inflamed and cracky if I get too close to my mouth as well. Even with that, it&#x27;s still the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Sadly - I will have to only give it two stars as I don&#x27;t like the product. It does not control my face&#x27;s oil production during hte day, but some how dries out my skin... In fact in the morning even after putting it on (to moisturize, right?) and after applying powder on it my face looks so dry and flaky as if i had a peel... but by 2pm my forehead and cheeks are as oily as they could be..It made me break out more and granted many face creams/moisturizers do that, i did not expect it from the Cetaphil brand and especially given the reviews on here. I will keep on looking... :/</li>
    <li> I created a skin regimen based on Amazon reviews and research, and this was my only dubious purchase. I have dark brown skin, and it does NOT in any way create a &#x27;matte&#x27; finish. It makes my face look oddly shiny. Also, I noticed that it contributes to my breaking out. I know for a fact it&#x27;s the lotion because i&#x27;ve kept the toner and the facewash in the regimen and saw my skin clear back up. I use this Thayers toner: http://amzn.to/16tW3n6 and I use this Cerave facewash: http://amzn.to/1aZFfcK</li>
    <li> Hard to find sunscreen that is also a moisturizer.  Also got good ratings as a sunscreen when I googled it.  Have already purchased 2 more&lt;br /&gt;bottles.  Got my husband to use it when he golfs.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and love the face wash of this line, so thought I&#x27;d try the lotion. It helped calm my red skin down and even helped my eczema on my arms I get every winter. You only need a little bit and it will last a long long time!</li>
    <li> Stumbled across this product at Walmart, and having such a great bond with Cetaphil products, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. This product cost $15, a bit pricey, when I can get the Clinique moisturizer that I normally use for the same price. Having such oily skin, I give anything a try (and am still looking!).&lt;br /&gt;This product is very thick (hence, it is sunblock). And it just weighs my face down when I apply it. I live in Hawaii, so it&#x27;s very humid and sunny here all year round. This product just adds more weight to my face. It also does nothing when controlling oil. I feel that I am more oily than before and I have to blot my face more often.&lt;br /&gt;I love Cetaphil products and I have such a great experience with them, so I&#x27;m disappointed to write this review. Maybe this tropical environment decreases its effectiveness or something because it doesn&#x27;t work for me :( Til then, I&#x27;ll be sticking to my Clinique moisturizer as it feels like I don&#x27;t have anything on when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Any comments on any products that reduces oil and shine, will be greatly appreciated!</li>
    <li> This did not help control my shine, I wasted my money on this product now it&#x27;s just sitting there collecting dust.</li>
    <li> I used this last year while on vacation.  Just a small amount because it has sunscreen.  It&#x27;s been in my medicine cabinet since, about 80 percent full.  I went to put some on this morning because its hot today and when I pumped it out it had small chunks of congealed lotion/sunscreen.  The expiration date shows 2015.  Not sure what went wrong (this didnt happen with my first one).  Disappointed and too late to get my money back...</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 years. This is the only moisturiser I could use on my acne prone face. It also is SPF 30. If get into the eyes accidentally or by sweating it irritates. That&#x27;s the only bad thing so far.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist turned me onto this as an &amp;#34;anti-aging secret&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s the only SPF moisturizer in the 30+ category that leaves a flawless, weightless finish. I use this every day without hesitation and helps me feel less guilty about enjoying the sun.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommends this brand to me. Honestly this is the only one brand that works for me so far. I have relatively oily facial skin, all other type of facial lotion I used, always gave me a shiny face at the end of the day. This one never. The only downside for this lotion is that when I apply it I need to be really careful to leave about 0.5cm space away from my eyes, otherwise I will have teary eyes during the day -- which is awkward &#x27;cause a young lady at work with teary eyes (or teary pink eyes) could be quite misleading.</li>
    <li> I like the sun protection coverage ans the silky smoothness when putting the cream on.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling , absorbing well.  I have to work at avoiding getting close to my eyes as it will make them water for the first hour or two.</li>
    <li> This cream works great and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice moisturizer for Acne-prone skin. I bought several others at the same time by different brands but this one is the best overall. It is a fair size for the price and also works really well. I bought another I liked, but it seemed rather expensive.</li>
    <li> I love Cetaphil products, so this product was a no-brainer.  Non-oily everyday SPF moisturizer.  My only issue is that the pump jammed up after my first use.  I now have to unscrew the top to get product out, which isn&#x27;t very practical.  I&#x27;m bummed, but I&#x27;m hoping I just got a bad bottle.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of controlling oily skin, especially in the summer months. In the middle of summer when humidity is extremely high and it&#x27;s quite hot outside I still get pretty shiny, but this is to be expected and my makeup does not come off which is is the important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that spf often irritates my skin and occasionally contributes to my adult acne, but this product has had no such effect. It is very mild and gentle and one pump is ample amount to cover one&#x27;s face completely. Before this I was using a very expensive lotion from the department store at over $45 per jar, but I actually think this one is better! The sun protection allows me use retinol creams and other acne treatments without worrying about doing damage to my skin while it is in a sensitive state. I will definitely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it for everyone? Of course not, but from my experience it is very gentle on sensitive skin, does a good job of controlling oil and shine, and is an excellent choice for anyone looking for SPF moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I work in sales and i often canvass for business in the blistering heat. My skin was getting very dry. I use this before going out now and find vast improvement in my skins condition !</li>
    <li> This product is very disappointing. I bought it because I have a problem with oily skin and this does not help at all, it actually makes me feel more oily than with other products. The sunscreen in it is the only plus+.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer works great on my skin leaves skin feeling great not oily. I would definitely recommend as this is now prt of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I use all Cetaphil products.  I had serious skin cancer on my face and since the surgery my skin is very dry.  These products help me.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product when the store was out of my regular moisturizer, and I am glad that I did. It works great, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal or like something my grandmother would wear. What&#x27;s better is how much you get for the price: this is a 4 oz bottle--other brands charge an exorbitant amount for .5 and 1 oz bottles. And it&#x27;s SPF 30--again, other brands charge an arm and a leg for higher SPFs. I liked this moisturizer so much that I tried other Cetaphil products as well, specifically their lotion and their liquid face cleanser, and I love those products too for the same reasons. They work great: the cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, the lotion keeps my skin moisturized, but it&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s non-fragrant, and you get so much for the price. I have become a devoted customer and advocate of Cetaphil products.</li>
    <li> Gone through tons of moisturizers and toners and ALL of that. Suffered from acne for YEARS. My dermatologist prescribed me an antibiotic and recommended this product along with the cleanser. WOW. This is a great moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It is truly OIL FREE. However, we didn&#x27;t look very hard and bought it online. Then a week later, found it on the shelves in Walmart. Oh well! Overall, this is light, moisturizing, but not oily enough to attract pimples. Love Cetaphil brand products. I definitely recommend this product. (Just bought the cleanser, but I&#x27;ve gotta use up my old one first!)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they call this oil control moisturizer, because it doesn&#x27;t leave a matte finish on the skin nor does it remotely control oil throughout the day. I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but when I apply my moisturizer and makeup at 7 am, I don&#x27;t want to be shiny faced by 9 am! Quite honestly, I am less shiny when I don&#x27;t use this. And for over $15, that&#x27;s not acceptable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about everyone else that&#x27;s reviewed this product who seems to use it only as sunscreen, but I use this primarily as a oil-controlling moisturizer with the added bonus of SPF. I&#x27;ve always had problem skin that gets progressively greasier throughout the day, but if I don&#x27;t moisturize then my skin dries out and starts producing even MORE oil. That being said, this stuff is awesome. I apply it after washing my face in the morning and before applying makeup. It absorbs quite quickly &amp; makes my makeup go on even smoother. It&#x27;s been great at controlling my oil problem &amp; it even protects me from sun damage! I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and it&#x27;s a steal at this price!!</li>
    <li> Horrible! I usually use the regular cetaphil moisturizer but my skin happens to be dry yet very oily so I thought I would give this one a try. What a huge mistake I made. This does the job for the first 3 hours or so but then by the end of the night my whole face is flaking! It controls the oil by not moisturizing your face at all! I&#x27;ll just be sticking to the regular moisturizer from now on..</li>
    <li> Great product.  Meets my needs.  Great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service was great, no delays.  Highly recommend for those who are interested in this product and others they sell.</li>
    <li> GREAT moisturizer no burning or greasy feeling!!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is perfect. Not oily at all. Does a great job of keeping my skin soft and smooth and acne free (in conjunction with my derm perscription).  Watch out for the eyes, though. Stings like crazy!</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps skin so soft. Amazon selling it means you get it for so much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Otherwise great. Smells less than the Clean and Clear advantage which actually has perfume in it. Works just as well and just smells like a sunscreen. But since other cetaphil prouducts are scent free and fragrance free such as the soap I would have thought this product would have been the same.</li>
    <li> Really wanted this to be perfect for me but it is just okay.  I use it daily and it helps when I am not applying powder.  It might be a good base under foundation but I don&#x27;t wear any.  Make sure you apply it quickly but thoroughly to avoid build up</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first at how matte this would actually be. I know cetaphil is reliable so I took the chance.  I have to say it does exactly what it says. It dries nice and dry and has kept me relatively oil free most of the day. I typically have an oily t zone. Very satisfied with it. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other product like it. Worth the money. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I was that surprised with its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 2 years on recommendation by my dermatologist and can&#x27;t complain. I haven&#x27;t really used any others so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but it&#x27;s a light-weight product that seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> super nongreasy easily absorbed sunscreen. I actually dont use it as a moisturizer but a sunscreen over my regular moisturizer</li>
    <li> So far, loving it. The consistency is like sun block- a little thinner. But that is probably on purpose since thicker lotions tend to make skin oily and this is for oily skin.. DO NOT GET IT IN YOUR EYES! Burns like a son of a gun! I have noticed my face is less oily but I am using this with other products so I credit all of the products for the change, not just this one.</li>
    <li> Really good lotion and sun [rotection</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! My face is pretty oily, but this moisturizer makes my look matte.It can sting my eyes a little, even when I don&#x27;t apply around my eyes, doesn&#x27;t bother me a lot tho.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this one. I use drying topical creams on my face to help keep my skin free from acne therefore I need a good moisturizer to help my usually oily skin regain some moisture. I find this burns my skin at times and it honestly doesn&#x27;t moisturize all that well either. Now I will only use this if I go to the beach and want the SPF protection but I purchased a new product to use daily for my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used over half of my bottle, so I&#x27;ve had plenty of time to see results. I also use the Cetaphil face wash (regular), and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face lotion is very thick like a sunscreen, and I am not sure which the manufacturers intended it to be: Sunscreen or an oil control moisturizer. If your face is remotely moist, it will not absorb to your skin (i.e. like sunscreen). If your face is dry, it does absorb fairly well, but I do not get a long-lasting matte finish as promised on the bottle. This does not even seem like a decent sunscreen, because as soon as you sweat even a minimalism amount, it runs off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a decent summer lotion but for indoor use only. Do not buy it for its oil controlling properties. Sadly, I must continue my search, because my skin was not tamed by this product.</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning and before bed. I apply it right after I wash my face to keep my skin moisturized. There is a noticeable difference in how less oily my skin is now after using this product. Though I could live without the metallic sunscreen smell but it&#x27;s only a small thing. I have seen a reduction in acne flare ups also. Greatly recommend this to anyone with oily skin!</li>
    <li> It goes on light, not greasy at all, but actually moisturizes. It&#x27;s a shame it only comes in tiny bottles.</li>
    <li> Not usually a fan of applying sunscreen because it is usually too thick.  This one is actually very easy to apply, and i have finally started using sunscreen every time i got out.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from a derm and the foaming facial wash (which leaves my skin feeling dry) and then broke out within a day or so. It says the moisturizer is oil-free and doesn&#x27;t clog pores but I had multiple little red pimples when I woke up. I likely will not purchase in the future. Buyer beware on this product line. I do like the Cetaphil antibacterial face soap for my body which can breakout a bit after workouts.</li>
    <li> I like it..but use it over a good moisturizer like you&#x27;re suppose to anyway. This is not oily, but does give that look..that&#x27;s the only downside I feel it has..I like the price as well and the pump bottle! Will recommend it for the price for sure!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for people with really oily skin.</li>
    <li> My regular morning routine before using this product was as follows: wash fash with exfoliating scrub for oily skin, clinique toner, then clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel (best stuff ever!), revlon colorstay foundation for oily skin. this process works very well to control my oil throughout the day. only downside was that i was getting enough spf, only spf 6 in the foundation. any other moisturizer i haved tried that has a higher spf makes me oil, this one is no exception. changed nothing in my routine except switched out moisturizer with cetaphil dermacontrol and boom! oil slick! i tried for about a week thinking maybe skin just needed to adjust. still oily, sadly this will be banished to the garbage....try neutrogena clear face! spf 30, no oil, period</li>
    <li> Good smell...  control oil, hydrate, and provide broad-spectrum, with matte effect in the skin. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I love that I finally found an acne moisturizer that wont clog pores and is an SPF! At first the lotion irrirated my skin, so I added grapeseed oil to it. The grapeseed oil made me breakout, so I stopped and just used the moisturizer itself and the irritation stopped as well. Not sure if my skin just needed to get use to it or what. A little goes a ling way. One pump moisturizeres my entire face, but be careful not to get jn your eyes! It will sting!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin pretty greasy but it keeps it from breaking out and flaking from being too dry.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion! I tried many other moisturizers before and they all seemed to clog my pores, it looked terrible, however this one is perfect! my skin was kind of oily with the other lotions i tried before and it looks so good now! i recommend it!</li>
    <li> This has lasted me very long. I use one pump a day, and it seems to work. I still have breakouts so it hasn&#x27;t helped much with that, but I love that it is all in one.</li>
    <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my skin and has sunblock in it. So far it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I credit this product and the matching cleaner for making my skin acne-free. It&#x27;s only taken twenty years to find these products! Over this past winter, I have noticed my skin getting a bit dry, so I tried and tried to find something else....and everything broke me out. I ended up using the Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer at night and this during the day. That seemed to give me a bit more moisture and didn&#x27;t break me out. Thanks, Cetaphil!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m alergic.  Makes me tear like crazy.</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive skin ever - I have been using Olay Sensitive SPF 15 for like ten years. So as I&#x27;m nearing 30, I kind of felt like it was time to up the ante on my SPF. This was the only lotion that I could upgrade to (after trying literally 5 different brands like Olay, Aveeno, etc). This is great coverage and doesn&#x27;t have a bad sunscreen smell.</li>
    <li> Very good for people on acne medications that dry the skin. My skin no longer peels since I started using this product! Thank you Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I received the item very quickly and I really like the product itself. Very light weight and not oily at all.</li>
    <li> The moisturiser does what it says on the tin except i find the finish is still quite greasy and shiny and I bought it for a matte finish so little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars because every facial sunscreen I buy is thick and heavy on my face. This lotion, however, is light and goes on like regular facial lotion. Other sunscreens also make my face breakout because I have super sensitive skin, and this one has caused no adverse reactions. It seems expensive especially if you don&#x27;t get free shipping, but it&#x27;s worth the cost if you have sensitive skin or hate thick/hard-to-rub-in creams.</li>
    <li> I finally found a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny and greasy! I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that I can use after my morning skin routine with SPF. I have dark spots on my face, and the SPF helps prevent them from getting darker while I exercise outside. I received it today, and used it for the first time. It&#x27;s perfect. I will update if needed. Only bad thing I received an expired $2 coupon in the box. :-(  (Moisturizer doesn&#x27;t expire until 9/16)</li>
    <li> Moisture and sun protection with out that heaving feeling...</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this. I like that it&#x27;s not greasy and it goes on smooth. It leaves my skin with just enough moisture yet has a matte finish. No scent which is bonus as I do not like perfumed moisturizers. Great price for the spf protection!</li>
    <li> Living in the high desert I use this product every day to prevent from drying out like a prune.&lt;br /&gt;The added sun protection is a bonus as I need that every day also.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Good lotion. Not to use around eyes, it will burn if it gets in eyes.</li>
    <li> I have probably tried at least 10 different moisturizers + SPF 30(+). I have acne, and use two different topical medications that make my skin sensitive to the sun, and a bit sensitive in general. I look for the following things in a moisturizer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 30+&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t promise silly things, just moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;- Decent price&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use container (that also fits easily in my small travel bag, I do a lot of travel)&lt;br /&gt;- Non-comedogenic&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t sting when I put it on or agitate my skin in any way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first moisturizer I have found that matches all those criteria, I highly recommend it if you are looking for sun protection that moisturizes without stinging.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product here, I bought it in CVS, I have acne problem, it gives the moisture but not greasy, it&#x27;s a really good product, I&#x27;ll definitely recommend. It smells kinda weird, but who cares, it is good for my skin.</li>
    <li> Just like the title states, this moisturizer stings the bejeezus out of my eyes after I apply it on my forehead (where I break out the most). But it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or makes me break out like other sunscreens so for now I&#x27;m gonna take the good with the bad and continue to use this whenever I&#x27;m out in the sun.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, I want to really like this product. I still use it from time to time. But it definitely makes my face greasy as hell. Not initially, but after 15 minutes or so it feels very oily, the opposite of oil control really. Also if you sweat, this will run into your eyes and burn painfully. I&#x27;ve had better luck with the Neutrogena dry touch ultra sheer stuff, so maybe I&#x27;ll go back. I have naturally oily skin so maybe if you have dry skin this might work out better for you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t take it near your eyes or you&#x27;ll cry.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion!  I have combination to oily skin, and since using this, I&#x27;ve felt very even on my face.  I haven&#x27;t had a break out like I did using lotions before this one.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Do not use this if you are acne prone or have sensitive skin! It will make you break out even more.</li>
    <li> It seems to work great, it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily and I love that it has sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer without leaving skin oily.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer and I have had it for months and I have barely made a dent in this bottle.  I have very oily skin, but this goes on without being greasy at all.  In the Spring/ Summer I will switch to a facial sunblock that has a higher SPF, but overall this is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I.m 28 yrs old with combination skin, hoping this would be the product for me, but it dries my skin and has this irritation feeling once I put it on and it&#x27;s not oil free</li>
    <li> There are 2 kind of sunscreen (physical and chemical) and this is the chemical kind. Check out the ingredients before purchasing. I don&#x27;t like the way it smells (has a very traditional sunscreen smell). I prefer moisturizers mixed with physical sun block because they don&#x27;t have as much odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had extremely oily and acne prone skin most of my adult life (been on Accutane three different times). I used to use the regular Cetaphil products and tried this out a few years ago. I was skeptical of its claims to reduce oil/shine, but much to my surprise, it actually made a significantly noticeable difference. However, after a few months of use, I felt like my skin returned to its normal oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed its effectiveness wore off, but I continue to still use this (and the foaming cleanser) years later because it&#x27;s actually a pretty good moisturizer/sunscreen combo for oily skin. The formula is very light and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. As someone in their late-20s and has tried dozens and dozens of &amp;#34;acne-prone&amp;#34; skin products over the past 10-15 years, I&#x27;d recommend skipping the harsh salicylic acid and/or benzoyl peroxide products and stick with Cetaphil; you really don&#x27;t need to stress your skin out any more than it already is.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned and have survived melanoma (twice!) as a younger man. I now put a lot of time into finding high quality, yet affordable, spf lotion that I use on my face and hands every day. Cetaphil Dermacontrol spf 30 is a great choice. The Environmental Working Group (ewg.org) conducts fantastic research on sunscreen products and their annual report is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; rescource for considering sunscreens. If money is no object you can find margianlly better products than Cetaphil, but at 5X the cost. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It&#x27;s non-greasy and invisible while providing the daily spf protection I need.</li>
    <li> Finding a non-greasy moisturizer with a decent amount of SPF is the holy grail of skin care products. Like many others on here, I have experimented with other products, but this is best one I&#x27;ve come across. Unlike other moisturizers with a higher SPF, this one does not leave a &#x27;white cast&#x27; and does not make your face oily after application. The 30 SPF rating alone for this price is a deal maker by itself. Yes, it may burn your eyes a little, but so will any other product that you place near your eyes.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer:  I started using this moisturizer at the same time as I started using Thayer&#x27;s Cucumber Witch Hazel Toner, not sure which is doing the most good, maybe both...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff is great.  I&#x27;d been using Purpose spf 15 moisturizer for years, and have always had problems with midday shine on my forhead, nose and chin.  I didn&#x27;t even know they made oil control moisturizers until recently and I wanted spf so tried this one.  It goes on light and dries fast, there is a smell when you first put it on but it&#x27;s quickly gone.  I wanted a higher spf so the smell sort of goes with the territory there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin freaks out at the least little thing and I&#x27;m 4 days in on this and no reaction whatsoever.  I put it on under my makeup this morning and when I went to the bathroom at noon to do my daily midday oil blot, I found I didn&#x27;t need to.  I was shocked, wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go, for $15 you can have all the anti-aging that comes with spf 30 plus way less shine.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This was my first Cetaphil purchase and I&#x27;m honestly not that impressed. I wasn&#x27;t expecting magical oil control from a moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t feel like this did anything special for my oily nose. My Olay moisturizer for combo/oily skin I feel keeps me less oily than this moisturizer. I can say it has great SPF, but the smell of the product is...not pleasant. I can&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
    <li> I originally got a sample of this from the dermatologist&#x27;s office, and never looked at it twice for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, do I wish I had checked it out sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use this as a sunscreen, I&#x27;m in the middle of a course of Accutane and almost everything I put on my skin burns like crazy, even supposedly gentle products like Aveeno. I had been using an Aveeno sunscreen for awhile, and it always burned and turned my face bright red, not to mention that it was extremely greasy, hard to apply makeup over, just a mess in general. While talking with my dermatologist, I asked her if a moisturizer with SPF, as long as I used the needed amount (at least 1/4 tsp. for just your face to get the advertised SPF protection), could replace my facial sunscreen because every one I had tried so far burned. She said I could, and so I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has made a world of difference! My face no longer burns every morning, and my makeup looks much better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also moisturizing enough that I can apply it to my Accutane-parched skin directly after cleansing my face, and not feel dry and like I need a heavier moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, this is definitely not a perfect product. While not greasy, it does leave a bit of a sheen, so it&#x27;s definitely not matte the way one might be hoping it to be, and because of this I really don&#x27;t imagine it would provide much in the way of mattifying properties if that is what one is looking for in this product (I can&#x27;t attest to this though, my skin currently is dry as a bone thanks to Accutane).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also burns like the dickens if you get it in your eyes, but that&#x27;s no surprise as most sunscreens do. I would suggest using a separate, non-burning moisturizer in your eye area followed by a nice big pair of sunglasses, or trying a stick/solid sunscreen in that area that&#x27;s less likely to transfer and move around, I use Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Swivel Stick in my eye area, and it works well, and doesn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this product and intend to continue using it for as long as they make it. Really great, I only wish I had known about it sooner.nd it works well, and doesn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this product and intend to continue using it for as long as they make it.

    <li> It is very good for keeping my skin feeling moisturised all day without making it oily.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for priming the skin for make-up.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is it can leave areas of my face a little dry if I use too much but if I use a richer moisturiser in dry areas that balances it out.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be for sensitive skin, but it irritates the hell out of my eyes! I saw a few reviews referring to burning eye sensation, but figured the reviewers might have had super sensitive skin. After all, it&#x27;s Cetaphil, how strong could it be? Well, now I know.&lt;br /&gt;I used it last night and today, and both time found my eyes irritated within the hour. I made sure that I did not get any product into my eyes, but just covered the skin of the eye area like I do with other mosterizers. Both time, my eyes got red and irritated. This has not happened with any other moisterizer I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for the sun protection and oil control, as I&#x27;m not going to be using it long enough to find out!</li>
    <li> Really shiny on my skin.. Greasy looking, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, even though it keeps me from getting sunburned..</li>
    <li> This is the first time using the Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer SPF 30.  It is light enough to apply daily and has the added ingredients to control excessive oil on acne prone skin.  Different from other cetaphil products I use, it has a light scent that is caused by the sunscreen ingredients.  And it burns a tiny bit on blemishes but not enough to quit using it.</li>
    <li> I use this with the matching foam wash. I like this moisturizer. It&#x27;s light and dries quickly. It goes well under my makeup and my face seems less oily since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that it burns my eyes if I get it too close, or if I don&#x27;t wash my hands after applying it then rub my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble finding the right product for my face. Finally switched  around from proactiv ( hate it) to neutrogena face wash (Which I love) but I needed a new moisterizer so i decided to try cetaphil since I heard good things! So far it works great. Is light and has SPF!</li>
    <li> I like this product having an SPF as well. 2 birds with 1 stone! It feels very light, tho moisturizes really good. I like it and tend to use it for a long time.</li>
