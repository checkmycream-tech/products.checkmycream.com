      <li>I have been trying so many products in hopes of not losing anymore hair and so far this hair serum ranks at the top!</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>After using it for months my hair feels softer and has filled in from where the shedding took it out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this will benefit the health of my hair, most importantly the new growth.</li>
      <li>My hair shedding is to a minimal and I am so happy that I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>I also notice how fast it grows because I have to color my hair more often.</li>
      <li>Every time I brush my hair, I have to clean my brush out because I am experiencing tremendous hair loss.  </li>
      <li>It does wash out completely when you wash your hair, even with sulfate free shampoo, which is a huge bonus.</li>
      <li>A huge plus is that it&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
      <li>After my first application, I found my hair revitalizing, moisturizing, and easier to comb.</li>
      <li>I have balding spots on my head most visible in the area above my temples.</li>
      <li>After using this for the first week, I started to notice my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out with reckless abandon like it was just days before.  </li>
      <li>This is my first bottle.</li>
      <li>They have used it a few times and are happy that it comes out easily with natural shampoo and like the way it leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>It starts my day on a positive note.</li>
      <li>But if I can only get partial gray changed back to my natural color, I’ll be more than happy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very hopeful about this product.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are very vage on the bottle , argan sw.</li>
      <li>The lavender aroma really makes me feel like I&#x27;m using a spa treatment.</li>
      <li>I would really like to know what ingredients are really in the mixture.</li>
      <li>I am so glad it is made of 100% Natural and Organic Essential Oils.  </li>
      <li>The listing on amazon did give a little more detail that there was lavender and rosemary.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this oil to anyone who wants to take care of their hair and scalp with an organic, all natural treatment.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this oil to anyone who wants to take care of their hair and scalp with an organic, all natural treatment.for that, but since it wasn&#x27;t helping I gave up.</li>
      <li>I have been suffering from thinning hair for a long time and have tried many different oils and hair growth serum.</li>
      <li>To top it off I color my hair every few weeks.  </li>
      <li>, Lavender Absolute has a higher concentration of linalool than lavender essential oil providing a healing environment for the scalp.  </li>
      <li>in it&#x27;s tracks, and this is the only thing I am using right now for hair loss prevention and growth</li>
      <li>I am waiting to see some new growth and also turning my&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think this could be used while you&#x27;re out in public without being very noticeable.</li>
      <li>It only being the first use i have no idea</li>
      <li>The serum itself is light with a little odor.</li>
      <li>Lavender also crosses the blood-brain barrier which is often an obstacle for the neurologists when treating the brain to create calm and soothing feelings deep in the inner brain.  </li>
      <li>When I saw this oil I wanted to try it since it is all natural and organic.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel soft and luxurious.</li>
      <li>I looked up the ingredients to see how this will work, and this is what I found:  Organic Argan oil nourishes and makes the shaft supple, Organic Pumpkin seed oil prevents DHT - the body’s chemical responsible for hair fall out, Rosemary herbal extract deeply cleanses the hair follicle from buildup of shampoo, conditioner residues and any dyes</li>
      <li>I started going gray in my early 20s and have almost 80% gray roots.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too early to comment.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m just going to rate it on what I have noticed so far and will update along the way.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>I rarely use conditioner on my hair as it leaves my hair flat, but using this oil I am doing co washing (conditioner only) and my hair is fluffier and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have seriously noticed lots of new baby hairs growing in which is pretty exciting since I bought this for my hair thinning and also falling out.  </li>
      <li>I could tell that it was made with natural ingredients and it really helped with my dry scalp.</li>
      <li>Wash my hair next day and it leaves my hair so soft and manageable and washes out with natural shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have only been using this for a week so far, but I will update this review after a month or so with any results and findings.</li>
      <li>Once I was it out my hair is left soft and shiney.</li>
      <li>I will use it even after my hair fills back in because the feel of my hair is so soft.</li>
      <li>I rub and massage, very gently, a small amount, into my scalp and do a chore or two while waiting the full 20 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Third when I wake up my hair is not dry and wild.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to see if my hair is really growing back, but what I do know, is it has drastically reduced the amount of hair I am losing every time I shower or brush it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, I just put it on my dry hair, after I brush it, and leave it in for at least 20 minutes before I get in the shower.  </li>
      <li>/&gt; gray back to its natural color, although that is a long shot for me.</li>

<li> After using this oil now every night, my scalp condition has improved a lot and there is hardly any acne like bumps left.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Scent is divine!  Received mine today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  Am in love with the aromatherapy.  Lightening fast shipping, thank you for the awesome launch promo!</li>
    <li> This hair growth serum/oil has such good ingredients that are known to be good for hair growth and conditioning. Argon oil, Almond oil, Avocado oil and essential oils. I have been suffering from thinning hair for a long time and have tried many different oils and hair growth serum. Some oils have helped but they are so difficult to wash without using a shampoo with SLS, which I don’t normally use. When I saw this oil I wanted to try it since it is all natural and organic. I have been using it for almost 15 days. I apply it to my hair and leave overnight. Wash my hair next day and it leaves my hair so soft and manageable and washes out with natural shampoo. My hair shedding is to a minimal and I am so happy that I made this purchase. I bought two more for my daughters who have been complaining about hair falling. They have used it a few times and are happy that it comes out easily with natural shampoo and like the way it leaves hair shiny and soft. For us it is a big plus since we don’t like to use shampoos with SLS. I am waiting to see some new growth and also turning my&lt;br /&gt; gray back to its natural color, although that is a long shot for me. I started going gray in my early 20s and have almost 80% gray roots. But if I can only get partial gray changed back to my natural color, I’ll be more than happy. I’ll update my review with any further improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (6/11/15). I have been using this hair oil for more than a month now and happy to report that I am seeing new growth. I have very fine hair, but now my hair texture looks thicker, fuller and more healthy. I rarely use conditioner on my hair as it leaves my hair flat, but using this oil I am doing co washing (conditioner only) and my hair is fluffier and shiny. I love to brush my hair as I don&#x27;t see a lot of hair falling. The hair fall is minimum, as you can see in the pictures. Also, when I started using this oil, I had these tiny acne like bumps on my scalp. I was under the treatment of a dermatologist for that, but since it wasn&#x27;t helping I gave up. After using this oil now every night, my scalp condition has improved a lot and there is hardly any acne like bumps left. So this LA MAGIE is helping me not only in hair growth but also health of my scalp. I highly recommend this oil to anyone who wants to take care of their hair and scalp with an organic, all natural treatment.for that, but since it wasn&#x27;t helping I gave up. After using this oil now every night, my scalp condition has improved a lot and there is hardly any acne like bumps left. So this LA MAGIE is helping me not only in hair growth but also health of my scalp. I highly recommend this oil to anyone who wants to take care of their hair and scalp with an organic, all natural treatment.</li>
    <li> When I first encountered the hair serum, I loved its smell. After my first application, I found my hair revitalizing, moisturizing, and easier to comb. I have been using it every time I shampoo my hair and the results have been terrific. Words cannot express how good it is in helping my hair to regain the vitality and volume. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I received this product, and boy does it smell wonderful.  And it works!  After a week of using it, my hair is softer and lusher.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what the result is in a month!</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product for very long. I bought because my hair has been breaking horribly  since having my daughter a year ago. And I began to feel like I was going bald it was breaking so bad. Ive used this product 3 times so far ,so I&#x27;m not sure if it works for hair growth yet, but I hope it does. The smell isn&#x27;t bad. I only shampoo my hair twice a week because it dries my hair out if I over shampoo. I put the product on the day/night before I am going to shampoo, because it leaves my hair looking and feeling extremely  greasy. Once I was it out my hair is left soft and shiney. And more importantly  I have noticed a drastic  difference  in the amount of breakage. I still have some shedding/ breakage but it&#x27;s minimal.  It&#x27;s amazing  I will continue to use  and u]date after a longer period.</li>
    <li> Got this for a few friends of mine and it has done wonders for them.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. Easy to apply and I love this product. I recommend it to my friends and the results are amazing. Used for 4 weeks and I think the results are amazing !! After using it for months my hair feels softer and has filled in from where the shedding took it out. It&#x27;s longer and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on it. I will use it even after my hair fills back in because the feel of my hair is so soft.</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle. I must admit that when I saw the size, I thought I will be done using it in three days.&lt;br /&gt;But no! Thankfully. This is my third week and I have still a lot left. You need very little to massage over your scalp and if needed on your hair too.&lt;br /&gt;First I love the fragrance! It starts my day on a positive note. Second the texture is just perfect. I need the oil to be slightly oily for managing and staying all day. Third when I wake up my hair is not dry and wild. It still feels as if I have taken shower just now. I don&#x27;t think that it is a coincidence that my hair grew at least half an inch since I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;I actually told about it to my hair stylist about it. She can&#x27;t wait to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY LOVE IT!  I put it on every night before I go to sleep and wash it out the next day.  I have seriously noticed lots of new baby hairs growing in which is pretty exciting since I bought this for my hair thinning and also falling out.  To top it off I color my hair every few weeks.  I also notice how fast it grows because I have to color my hair more often. I have been trying so many products in hopes of not losing anymore hair and so far this hair serum ranks at the top!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair oils and serums and absolutely LOVE this!  Makes my hair and scalp feel great and it smells divine. A huge plus is that it&#x27;s all natural and organic. Just purchased a bottle for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Like the product but not the smell</li>
    <li> Loved the smell and richness of this hair serum. I could tell that it was made with natural ingredients and it really helped with my dry scalp. I use it at least once a week as a leave-in hair treatment. It washes away easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue. It makes my hair feel soft and luxurious.</li>
    <li> I just received the La Magie hair treatment and have used it about 3 times. It smells great and I&#x27;ve seen an improvement with my dry scalp. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any difference in hair growth, but will revise my review when I have an update.</li>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to see if my hair is really growing back, but what I do know, is it has drastically reduced the amount of hair I am losing every time I shower or brush it.  My mother&#x27;s hair got pretty thin after she turned 40, and I just hit that age 6 months ago.  It seems like over the past 3 to 4 months, my hair has been falling out like crazy.  Every time I brush my hair, I have to clean my brush out because I am experiencing tremendous hair loss.  I am devastated by how thin my hair has become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this a few week ago, in the 30ml size.  I am so glad it is made of 100% Natural and Organic Essential Oils.  I don&#x27;t want to put harsh chemicals on my scalp.  After using this for the first week, I started to notice my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out with reckless abandon like it was just days before.  After another week, I feel like I am losing the same amount of hair as before, which has essentially knocked out the shedding that has been making me self conscious for the past several months.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if regrowth is under way, but I do know the excessive shedding has stopped, dead in it&#x27;s tracks, and this is the only thing I am using right now for hair loss prevention and growth restoration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, I just put it on my dry hair, after I brush it, and leave it in for at least 20 minutes before I get in the shower.  This way, my hair isn&#x27;t oily after using it.  This is the method of application La Magie recommends, so I am sticking to the directions.  I rub and massage, very gently, a small amount, into my scalp and do a chore or two while waiting the full 20 minutes.  It also smells wonderful and I am so happy I was chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  This is my personal experience with this product.  This is also another reason why I secretly want to smack my husband.  He has a perfectly thick head of hair with no hair loss at all, and neither does his father!  Tsk Tsk Tsk!th no hair loss at all, and neither does his father!  Tsk Tsk Tsk!</li>
    <li> I have just started using it for last 2 weeks. It&#x27;s too early to comment. I feel that it is working based on 2 weeks of use. Need to wait for another 2 months and see the result.</li>
    <li> I just received LA Magic hair serum so I&#x27;m just going to rate it on what I have noticed so far and will update along the way.&lt;br /&gt; So it comes in a small bottle. The serum itself is light with a little odor. Not to bad though. Once it is on the hair you can feel the difference. You could no longer see the dry flakes on my scalp. My hair is really dry and broke off. And I have little to no edges do to braids. So I am hoping that this hair serum helps me in my growth journey. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is bc I want to see how it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m recovering from postpartum hair loss after the birth of my last child. I have balding spots on my head most visible in the area above my temples. This organic hair growth oil caught my eye because it seemed like an easy thing to do for the health of my hair while I am home with my kids. This is an oil and the instructions say to use it at least 20 minutes before you shower or overnight. I really don&#x27;t think this could be used while you&#x27;re out in public without being very noticeable. I sprayed it on my balding spots, and used my fingers to massage it into my head. It smells fantastic. The lavender aroma really makes me feel like I&#x27;m using a spa treatment. After having it in my hair for over an hour, it still smells great. I&#x27;m sure this will benefit the health of my hair, most importantly the new growth. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> Received my Hair growth spa treatment yesterday ripped open the package and headed to the shower. There is no instruction on how to use on the bottle or in the packaging so i just guessed. I washed my hair and dried and went to town with the spray. I smells pretty good too. It only being the first use i have no idea if its going to work, but this morning my hair sure felt softer and there was no fight to get my brush thru my super course hair. The ingredients are very vage on the bottle , argan sw. almond, rosehip, herbs, absolutes and essen. oils. I would really like to know what ingredients are really in the mixture. The listing on amazon did give a little more detail that there was lavender and rosemary. but i would like that listed on the bottle or with a handout on how to use it.</li>
    <li> This La Magie Hair growth Spa treatment was delivered protectively packaged and sealed to prevent spillage.  We purchased the hair serum in a promotion for testing and review.  The serum has a &#x27;cream rinse&#x27; texture.  Massage into scalp where treatment is needed.  It does not leave an oily residue, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
