      <li>Great product for the price!</li>
      <li>Great!  </li>
      <li>Great item for the price!</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>The mitts are great to use with the thera barh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These work great.</li>
      <li>Great purchase, good price</li>
      <li>These mitts are as good as the ones used in a salon I&#x27;ve been to.  </li>
      <li>Better use oven gloves!</li>
      <li>After dipping your hands you put your hands in the plastic bags, then you put your hands in these mittens to keep the wax warm.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to keep the warmth for a good 15 minutes with them covering the plastic liners.</li>
      <li>Love these was using the plastic bags with a towel wrapped around but this is really nice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started using an oven mitt and that works better.</li>
      <li>Ordered 2 more sets</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that these aren&#x27;t the greatest at keeping the heat of the wax going for very long.</li>
      <li>Very soft good sized and easy to use ther is just so much you can say about a paraffin bath mitt but for what it is worth they are great.</li>
      <li>My wife and I think they work just fine.</li>
      <li>Great, just what I expected.</li>
      <li>Good enough for the price</li>
      <li>I actually think a pair of cotton socks would work better....</li>
      <li>They are large but can be cinched in with the velcro fasteners.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>

<li> They are very big and hard to keep on, but soft.</li>
<li> Also why weren&#x27;t these lined with a plastic or vinyl material so that I don&#x27;t have to put on other gloves before slipping these on.  </li>
<li> Works well with paraffin hand bath to keep hands warmer and out of trouble while waiting for paraffin to soak in.</li>
<li> it so big and very thin cloth.</li>
<li> I read some negative comments about these mittens but after getting them I don&#x27;t understand why you wouldn&#x27;t like them.</li>
<li> Not as thick as I hoped</li>
<li> Poor quality, extremely thin, returning them.</li>
<li> The gloves are so thin.</li>
<li> They should be gloves for keeping the heat inside, but with this thin fabric that cannot function.</li>

After dipping your hands you put your hands in the plastic bags, then you put your hands in these mittens to keep the wax warm. The velcro then closes the mittens around your arms. My wife and I think they work just fine.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t like these mittens at all.  They are very big  and the velco does not help with tightening them to seal in the heat,  Also why weren&#x27;t these lined with a plastic or vinyl material so that I don&#x27;t have to put on other gloves before slipping these on.  I tried using these once and have set them aside because they provided no benefit.  I actually think a pair of cotton socks would work better....I think I&#x27;ll try them.</li>
    <li> Great, just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great!  Ordered 2 more sets</li>
    <li> way to big for a lady&#x27;s hand</li>
    <li> Good enough for the price</li>
    <li> i dont like this mitten. it so big and very thin cloth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that these aren&#x27;t the greatest at keeping the heat of the wax going for very long. I&#x27;ve started using an oven mitt and that works better.</li>
    <li> These are a lot lighter weight than was expecting. Not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The mitts are great to use with the thera barh.&lt;br /&gt;I used to wrap a towel before I got the mittens so that I see the difference of using the mittens now,</li>
    <li> The gloves are so thin. They should be gloves for keeping the heat inside, but with this thin fabric that cannot function. Better use oven gloves!</li>
    <li> works well with the wax bath.</li>
