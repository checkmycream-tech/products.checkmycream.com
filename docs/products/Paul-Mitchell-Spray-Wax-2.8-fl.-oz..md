      <li>So in love with this product!  </li>
      <li>Paul Michells spray wax is easy to use and does a great job when you want that spike look.</li>
      <li>No odor, good product.liked it better than hair spray</li>
      <li>Holds your flippy do in place nicely.</li>
      <li>It did give the hold &amp; flexibility of style I liked..</li>
      <li>So easy to use!</li>
      <li>I wonder if there is some way I can suggest all the people that reek of Aquanet that there is an alternative (okay, that is a joke</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s just me :-)  )</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>To top it off, it took THREE washes to get it out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Adds more texture than a sea salt spray.</li>
      <li>This item works magic.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff - just go light really light on the application to keep your hair from looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is such a great product if used right!!  </li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell products are always high quality and pretty good smelling, and this is no exception.</li>
      <li>By far my favorite hair product!</li>
      <li>My hairdresser turned me on to the fact that spray wax existed and now I have a can at home and at work for those quick morning styling moments.</li>
      <li>Great hold, but doesn&#x27;t gunk up my hair or weigh it down.</li>
      <li>and it looks totally fresh again.</li>
      <li>This is a product that I highly recommend, I found it easy to find and purchase from Amazon and will continue to do so.</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a direct spray but more of a &amp;#34;walk into the spray&amp;#34; spray!  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it to spray right on my hair.</li>
      <li>however it made my hair dull looking and pretty much necessary to not skip even  a day of washing to get the best results.</li>
      <li>I find it best to use lightly when hair is slighly damp, mess your hair up with your fingers, then about 20 minutes later (when your hair IS dry) run your fingers through your hair to get the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; off and have your hair styled just the way you like it.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something lighter and wanted to spray it on the palm of my hand &amp; then work it into certain places that needed it.</li>
      <li>It is good to style hair but is is really hard to wash out of hair.</li>
      <li>makes my hair really sticky though.</li>
      <li>I really like this spray wax.</li>
      <li>It gets very sticky and then flattens your hair.  </li>
      <li>I really do not like this product because it is not user friendly.  </li>
      <li>Wish I would have found this when I first cut my hair short.</li>
      <li>Holds my hair all day and stays soft.</li>
      <li>The closest so far to John Friedas discontinued Toussled Tresses</li>
      <li>The feel of it in my hair was nearly unbearable.  </li>
      <li>it was VERY sticky, and it never seemed to dry.  </li>
      <li>Be careful about how much you apply.  </li>

<li> Be careful about how much you apply.  </li>
<li> I have long hair and like to use this around the roots so it won&#x27;t look flat.</li>
<li> One can of spray  lasts a long time.</li>
<li> Only need a little to last all day.</li>
<li> When your hair starts to fall flat, just give it a little fluff</li>
<li> Just spray a little, run your hands through, and you&#x27;re done - with nearly no residue on the hands to worry about (a tissue takes care of it).</li>
<li> The stuff I use, and the things other people use</li>
<li> I can scrunch my hair for body, or slick it back to look</li>
<li> Miracle spray for my thick, short hair.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I am a little alergic to the Paul MItchel fragrance</li>
<li> It adds texture but is not sticky or stiff like hairspray.</li>
<li> And if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday-it may be difficult to style you hair the second day. .</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Eufora Details spray wax, but wanted to find something less expensive.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m having some issues where the smell of hairspray makes me ill.</li>
<li> I even tried using a tiny bit, but it made my hair look terrible.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this product isn&#x27;t it!  </li>
<li> When you spray it into your hands, it turns into whisps of sticky, stringy stuff that is impossible to work into the hair.</li>
<li> - I can smell hairspray 20-30 feet away (talk about annoying!)  </li>
<li> but this is awful stuff!  </li>

    <li> Be careful about how much you apply.  It gets very sticky and then flattens your hair.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> So in love with this product!  Super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Only need a little to last all day. When your hair starts to fall flat, just give it a little fluff and it looks totally fresh again. I&#x27;ve been hooked for years. If they ever do away with it, I will CRY!</li>
    <li> Works alright, makes my hair really sticky though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! My stylist used it on me and I had to get it. I had been using a hairspray with wax to add texture, but I get the results I want with this spray. It adds texture but is not sticky or stiff like hairspray. I have long hair and like to use this around the roots so it won&#x27;t look flat. By far my favorite hair product! Adds more texture than a sea salt spray.</li>
    <li> When I changed my hair style to short, short, I needed a product that I could use to spike my hair.  Paul Michells spray wax is easy to use and does a great job when you want that spike look. Your hair doesn&#x27;t have that built up product look. This is a product that I highly recommend, I found it easy to find and purchase from Amazon and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - just go light really light on the application to keep your hair from looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells great. I&#x27;m having some issues where the smell of hairspray makes me ill. The stuff I use, and the things other people use - I can smell hairspray 20-30 feet away (talk about annoying!)  This has no alcohol odor, and gives my hair enough texture to hold throughout the day. I can scrunch my hair for body, or slick it back to look sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they don&#x27;t keep making it. I wonder if there is some way I can suggest all the people that reek of Aquanet that there is an alternative (okay, that is a joke....I know it&#x27;s just me :-)  )</li>
    <li> Oh my but this is awful stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using Eufora Details spray wax, but wanted to find something less expensive.  Unfortunately this product isn&#x27;t it!  From the moment I sprayed it into my hair it was VERY sticky, and it never seemed to dry.  The feel of it in my hair was nearly unbearable.  To top it off, it took THREE washes to get it out of my hair.  I returned it, and will go back to the Eufora if this is my only alternative.</li>
    <li> I really like this spray wax. Holds your flippy do in place nicely. Warning though, do not expect to comb through your hair after applying it! To remove it, you have to wash your hair with warm-hot water. I do not see this as a downfall of the product, however I think people need to know this before you start experimenting with it. And if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday-it may be difficult to style you hair the second day. . Love it! I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I am a little alergic to the Paul MItchel fragrance and I can&#x27;t use it every day...But this is a very good product</li>
    <li> The best hair wax I have ever used.  Holds my hair all day and stays soft.</li>
    <li> This item works magic. I find it best to use lightly when hair is slighly damp, mess your hair up with your fingers, then about 20 minutes later (when your hair IS dry) run your fingers through your hair to get the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; off and have your hair styled just the way you like it.</li>
    <li> My stylist introduced me to spray wax. I love it! Great hold, but doesn&#x27;t gunk up my hair or weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Good hold, cleans off hands. One can of spray  lasts a long time. No odor, good product.liked it better than hair spray</li>
    <li> The price was great.  The packaging was fine and arrived on time!!  This product works well for short hair. Spray sparingly.</li>
    <li> It did give the hold &amp; flexibility of style I liked..however it made my hair dull looking and pretty much necessary to not skip even  a day of washing to get the best results. The closest so far to John Friedas discontinued Toussled Tresses</li>
    <li> I really do not like this product because it is not user friendly.  The sprayer constantly clogs up with wax.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product if used right!!  It&#x27;s not a direct spray but more of a &amp;#34;walk into the spray&amp;#34; spray!  Is great hold without being sticky!</li>
    <li> Too pricey but does a good job.</li>
    <li> Miracle spray for my thick, short hair.  All I do is style, spray, and finger comb hair and I and done. Wish I would have found this when I first cut my hair short. So easy to use!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My hairdresser turned me on to the fact that spray wax existed and now I have a can at home and at work for those quick morning styling moments. Just spray a little, run your hands through, and you&#x27;re done - with nearly no residue on the hands to worry about (a tissue takes care of it). Brilliant. Paul Mitchell products are always high quality and pretty good smelling, and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> Great holding wax! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to spray right on my hair. I was looking for something lighter and wanted to spray it on the palm of my hand &amp; then work it into certain places that needed it.</li>
    <li> Way too sticky. I gave it away. When you spray it into your hands, it turns into whisps of sticky, stringy stuff that is impossible to work into the hair. I even tried using a tiny bit, but it made my hair look terrible.</li>
    <li> It is good to style hair but is is really hard to wash out of hair. I washed it three times and it still felt like there was residue left.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and love it !!</li>
