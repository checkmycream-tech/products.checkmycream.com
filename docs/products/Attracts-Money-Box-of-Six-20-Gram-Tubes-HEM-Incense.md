      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>Great product and value</li>
      <li>Just not as good as &amp;#34;Good Fortune&amp;#34; in that it irritates my eyes.</li>
      <li>I prefer HEM incense to some of the others, burns well, good scent.</li>
      <li>This smells wonderful- rich and mystical.</li>
      <li>I love this scent!</li>
      <li>If it does{even if it DOES&#x27;NT}, I&#x27;ll be buying MUCH more!)</li>
      <li>The scent is nice.  </li>
      <li>but it sure smells good.</li>
      <li>(We liked cedar and forest)</li>
      <li>money-drawing incense almost always has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>smellls nice ...would buy again</li>
      <li>This is a fragrant, nice incense, but somewhat strong.</li>
      <li>I gotta say I love it.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it will help bring more money, but it hurts my eyes to use it.</li>
      <li>HEM has always been a favorite brand when it came to incense</li>
      <li>I just love these.</li>
      <li>Smells a bit too soapy for me most of the time.</li>
      <li>I love Hem incense</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer mentioned \\&quot;I do&#x27;nt know if it attracts money, but it sure smells good\\&quot; That reviewer couldn&#x27;t be more right if they tried!</li>
      <li>Smells great but as far as attracting money part dosen&#x27;t</li>
      <li>It was the first time I ever bought any, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>If you can handle strong scents this one is for you</li>
      <li>Sticks light easily and burn all the way to stick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy a lot more. :)</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure HEM&#x27;s &amp;#34;Protection&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>If it makes me rich</li>
      <li>For any guy wanting to look for something that he can burn before a \\&quot;special friend\\&quot; comes over, these are what your looking for.</li>
      <li>Smells ok until lit, very perfumy.</li>
      <li>I really like the fragrance of this incense and the title was interesting.</li>
      <li>Because I love the aroma so much I have given some to friends.</li>
      <li>and I strongly believe that gratitude is a necessary part of an abundant life.</li>
      <li>This could work it&#x27;s way into my top ten of favorite scents by HEM.</li>
      <li>I like \\&quot;Dragon&#x27;s Blood Blue\\&quot; and also \\&quot;Bergamot\\&quot; from HEM, and from what I&#x27;ve experienced, this smells like a little of a mix of the two of them.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t light this unless I absolutely have to.</li>
      <li>when I was 8, a kind woman I had befriended at a campground left a vial of this scented oil in my shoe as a parting gift.</li>
      <li>but it really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>They smell fresh.</li>
      <li>but this was my first purchase of this scent.</li>
      <li>I remember this exact smell-</li>
      <li>Smells good and seems to be working when used along with a green candle.</li>
      <li>Some brands burn quick, some are dry and crumble, but I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the varieties I&#x27;ve tried from HEM so far.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Thanks for asking.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Very seductive smell to them.   </li>
      <li>It is a rich, heady scent that lingers long after it finishes burning.</li>
      <li>I actually did have an unexpected monetary gift arrive the day after I burnt these, we still laugh about the uncanny coincidence!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been gone for years, but this incense brought it right back and flooded my with feelings of prosperity.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are other less powerful fragrances available.</li>
      <li>Not only do I like the scent, but it actually seemed to live up to it&#x27;s name!</li>

    <li> I love Hem incense but this was my first purchase of this scent. I really like it. It is a rich, heady scent that lingers long after it finishes burning. I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I just love these. They came on time. They smell fresh. I will buy these again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I prefer HEM incense to some of the others, burns well, good scent. I actually did have an unexpected monetary gift arrive the day after I burnt these, we still laugh about the uncanny coincidence! Some brands burn quick, some are dry and crumble, but I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the varieties I&#x27;ve tried from HEM so far.</li>
    <li> HEM has always been a favorite brand when it came to incense but until I stumbled upon these, I didn&#x27;t know what an incense was. Very seductive smell to them.   For any guy wanting to look for something that he can burn before a \\&quot;special friend\\&quot; comes over, these are what your looking for. They last for about a half hour and the smell lingers in a room for hours. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Not only do I like the scent, but it actually seemed to live up to it&#x27;s name! I will be ordering more of this one!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant scent but no money yet. ..LOL</li>
    <li> Creates a relaxed aura in the house. Elevates the vibe. Still waiting for the money$. Great for meditation indoors or out</li>
    <li> Smells a bit too soapy for me most of the time. Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure HEM&#x27;s &amp;#34;Protection&amp;#34; incense and this one are the same product in different packaging. My nose is seldom wrong about things like that.</li>
    <li> This could work it&#x27;s way into my top ten of favorite scents by HEM. Not floral, not musky, and yet not head shopey either. I gotta say I love it. If it makes me rich I&#x27;ll certainly buy a lot more. :)</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful- rich and mystical. I remember this exact smell- when I was 8, a kind woman I had befriended at a campground left a vial of this scented oil in my shoe as a parting gift. It&#x27;s been gone for years, but this incense brought it right back and flooded my with feelings of prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thankful to have this to remind me of all the kindness I&#x27;ve received in my life- and I strongly believe that gratitude is a necessary part of an abundant life.</li>
    <li> smellls nice ...would buy again</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It was the first time I ever bought any, and I&#x27;m glad I did! As another reviewer mentioned \\&quot;I do&#x27;nt know if it attracts money, but it sure smells good\\&quot; That reviewer couldn&#x27;t be more right if they tried! I like \\&quot;Dragon&#x27;s Blood Blue\\&quot; and also \\&quot;Bergamot\\&quot; from HEM, and from what I&#x27;ve experienced, this smells like a little of a mix of the two of them. That&#x27;s the best I can describe it for those of you who have&#x27;nt tried it yet. If you have smelled those scents from HEM, and like them, you may wish to try this one out. (BTW, I&#x27;ll let you know if it works. If it does{even if it DOES&#x27;NT}, I&#x27;ll be buying MUCH more!)</li>
    <li> Smells great but as far as attracting money part dosen&#x27;t work atleast with me.</li>
    <li> Just not as good as &amp;#34;Good Fortune&amp;#34; in that it irritates my eyes. A bit disappointed is all. I wish I could return it but it really isn&#x27;t worth it. Perhaps it will help bring more money, but it hurts my eyes to use it. Too bad there!!! I won&#x27;t order it again. Thanks for asking.</li>
    <li> Because I love the aroma so much I have given some to friends. Even without me asking, they go out of their way to tell me the same thing and ask where I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is a fragrant, nice incense, but somewhat strong. If you&#x27;re in a small space (we&#x27;re at about 1300 sq ft), it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming. There are other less powerful fragrances available. (We liked cedar and forest)</li>
    <li> The scent is nice.  I like the ideal of this scent attracting money.  If you believe it enough, then it will happen for you.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> If you can handle strong scents this one is for you</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfully calming sent.  Sticks light easily and burn all the way to stick.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about it attracting money, but I ordered it because it smells wonderful and it lasts forever.I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> ... but it sure smells good. I bought this because I like to burn incense in my home, and money-drawing incense almost always has a nice scent. I&#x27;ll let you know if it starts drawing money.</li>
    <li> Smells good and seems to be working when used along with a green candle.</li>
    <li> Great product and value</li>
    <li> I really like the fragrance of this incense and the title was interesting. I might buy it again. I wish the fragrance lingered  longer after burning it. So I will look for a longer lasting or stronger incense.</li>
    <li> Smells ok until lit, very perfumy. I won&#x27;t light this unless I absolutely have to.</li>
    <li> A great scent and a great price!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Will buy again!</li>
