<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only bad is the tools rusted the first time I sanitized them.</li>
    <li> These work great! They are actually sharp enough to push your cuticles back.</li>
    <li> at cuticle carter really bad</li>
    <li> Work great, good quality too.</li>
    <li> Just what we asked for!</li>
    <li> The nipper alone can cost up to $15+ at the store so this paid for itself instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Be preparef for the wait, as these take a long time to ship. But I can wait for a savings this big!!</li>
    <li> 2 words: GREAT SELLER! I was really impressed with price point and quality of the product. Product arrived with a sheen of dust so I had to wash it and disinfect with alcohol. Overall great shopping experience.</li>
    <li> The pusher tools are perfect; good quality workmanship &amp; no snaggy metal edges to damage your nails (either set).  The cuticle nipper itself is a high-quality, German made item with warranty information on the package.  Great deal for the price, and the shipping (free).  I like this nipper just as much as my TweezerMan one, and the 2 pusher tools are better than the ones I got at Sally Beauty Supply (which I&#x27;ve now since tossed out).  A highly recommended purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the items is perfect for my fingers. They hug my finger nails so i don&#x27;t have to go over the same place because it won&#x27;t reach, etc.&lt;br /&gt;And i have a cuticle nipper now and i like this one so much better!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great thing for a great price.</li>
    <li> As a professional nail technician who has a diabetic clients, I was looking for an economical way to ensure they had their own supplies.  Very, very pleased with the packaging and presentation of the pack.  High quality and know my clients who will be receiving them will be pleased.</li>
    <li> The nippers are very sturdy and sharp and tiny to cut every cuticle and skin tag; excellent.  Good spring handle easy to hold steady.  Then the tools are very good quality, and work very well, cleaning under the nail, pushing back cuticles, cleaning the nail bed, and they all come in protective packaging, individually to keep their sharp edge and to protect yourself when opening the package.  I really lucked out finding this set on Amazon, my favorite website for everything in my life, litterally!</li>
    <li> shipping was fairly quick and product arrived damage free and in a plastic pouch. the pouch has started to fall apart, but the tools are still good!</li>
    <li> Great value for money.  As good as they look.  Quality.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these instruments, considering the price was very low ! These are professional grade durable nail grooming tools. I anticipate they will last me for a long time !</li>
    <li> I would rather use kitchen scissors than this.&lt;br /&gt;This is dumb. Other things, those are also dumb!!&lt;br /&gt;I should buy new one.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy! It is nice to work with!</li>
    <li> Perfect! I love these untensils!</li>
    <li> can beat the price plus getting great quality? sold!</li>
    <li> These implements are great for the price. I am glad I bought them</li>
    <li> Great quality, an really great price!</li>
    <li> ordering again this is awsome</li>
    <li> Started rusting just after a couple uses</li>
    <li> It was nice, but dull.</li>
    <li> The cuticle nippers aren&#x27;t very sharp I threw them out cause they would just pull but the cuticle pushers were great!</li>
    <li> I looked up how to cut and trim off my cuticles and immediately decided to get these tools asap! The minute I got them I knew they were worth it! The shipping came in fast and they were of course new. What I advise is to look up how to do you nails and hopefully these tools will be worth the money!! They are confusing to use at first but completely worth it! Even when I get my nails done i bring them to my salon and they&#x27;re willing to use them! I guess it&#x27;s better than their tools!</li>
    <li> took forever to receive this merchandise. Great product very well made great price.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY what i was looking for !!!</li>
    <li> love love love it, price is great, product is great...  by the way, they sell at CVS $10 a piece!!!!!!  GREAT VALUE!!!!  Bought them twice!!!!</li>
    <li> High quality product.</li>
    <li> Small size and accessories are just what I wanted.  Just fits in a woman&#x27;s hand. Top quality product thinking of ordering another but this time I need a little case for it so I can carry in my purse</li>
    <li> The cuticle trimmer didn&#x27;t work. It can&#x27;t even trim my thin skin. So disappointed ! So Waste my money .</li>
    <li> Great tools for doing my nails. I do acrylics and these tools are strong enough to cut through them, clean under and around them and help remove them. Better that what I would have found at the drug store-and I couldn&#x27;t find them at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Everything what I expected</li>
    <li> Shipping took couple weeks, they where well packaged, nothing missing nor broken.  These are pretty nice for he price. They came in separate individual packages. The cuticle cutter is made by solingen Germany if you want to do further research. The cutters meet together nicely and cut the cuticle like its suppose to with ease. Then the other two tools are very handy as pictured, you will not need anything else. Very good quality</li>
    <li> Incredibly high quality!</li>
    <li> I recommend it to everyone .. are of very good quality and very beautiful .. besides that they are not very expensive</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time first waiting on this. I ordered it, it took over 2 months to arrive, and the customer service barely spoke English. When I finally did get it, they are so cheap and terrible! The tools are very rough with lots of sharp edges, making the cuticle tools practically unusable. The cuticle trimmers are so dull it hurts to use them because you have to squeeze and pull so hard to make them work. I know it&#x27;s really really cheap, but it was honestly more a waste of time and effort than it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The cuticle nippers I bought some years ago broke, the arm that made it spring back into place snapped due to the friction of opening and closing.  So I searched on amazon.com and found this pair.  The price was unbelievably reasonable.  It was amazing that they came with two other manicure tools, which I&#x27;ve used and like much better than the tools I already had..  I have had them for a few days and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The snippers are VERY well made.  Much better than the last one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had in the past which cost me more.  They are very sharp and efficient.  The cuticle nipper is made differently than the one&#x27;s I used to have and actually, they are made much better.  The enclosed information said to lubricate the nippers, which had never been advised with my old one&#x27;s.  The quality of these nippers far exceeds my expectations.  I love these nippers and I&lt;br /&gt;am sure they will outlast me!</li>
    <li> I like it, not a bad set at all, faster shipping than I thought and it is exactly as described, not disappointed :-)</li>
    <li> The long wait was worth it the products are just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I could not believe that I was able to find such a super deal on this product. Might have to wait a few days but worth the savings.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought</li>
    <li> The items are very poor quality, do NOT buy it, even just few dollar, it just waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love them they come in handy my go to tools.I don&#x27;t leave home without it. I would recommend this product to others &amp; I have.</li>
    <li> Others have complained their nippers broke. Mine haven&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve found these, in fact, to be preferrable to others I&#x27;ve spent much more on in the store because the thing between the blades doesn&#x27;t slide off to the side. For the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> The nipper is dull, and the big tool took part of my toe nail off, you have little control, maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use these tools, but they just don&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and not at all brittle as others are making it out to be. Works fine to me.</li>
    <li> I got this today and the tools are very sturdy and already extremely helpful.</li>
    <li> Considering I paid like $2.50 or so... this is great! If I had bought this at the local beauty supply shop I would have paid well over $30. The smaller cuticle nipper works great. Its very sturdy and I swear its as good a quality as the ones that the nail techs use at the nail salon. Love this!</li>
    <li> They were fine when they first arrived but they were incredibly cheap. Isabel had them for maybe two weeks and they ate already broken.  I mean I guess it should be expected for the price.</li>
    <li> This product did actually show up in the mail, unlike the cuticle oil, they work just like they should. Pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Great quality and inexpensive. I use these all the time and they work great. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying a more expensive product.</li>
    <li> Doing my own nail tips makes this packet of three essential. I love the cuticle nipper. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty. Good quality. Good value.</li>
    <li> Not sure why it says pocket size when they&#x27;re Regular size tools. Great quality. Sharp edges. Highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Bought this a s a back up set to take to the nail salon, works ok.</li>
    <li> great deal. nice quality. thank you!</li>
    <li> Best $3 I&#x27;ve ever spent! Same quality as what I would find at the drugstore for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as specified and I received all three items as ordered, but the cuticle clipper is horrible. It is extremely dull and pulls the cuticle instead of clipping it. I had to purchase an additional cuticle clipper from a beauty store. Disappointed in the product. I would not recommend the purchase.</li>
    <li> What a deal!! Pretty decent quality too!</li>
    <li> Helps my Granddaughter to to nails.  I figured if she does nails she needs the proper equipment for them to look nice before she polishes and designs.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy Implements good for the price since I replace every 3 months worth the cost. Very satisfied with them</li>
    <li> Love this and though it was a really great deal and I liked the nippers and the cuticular around the nail bed</li>
    <li> Took a while to ship, but when they arrived they were great! The clippers are my favorite tool. The two cuticle pushers are incredibly sharp--too sharp even, I&#x27;ve slipped and sliced my cuticle more than once. They&#x27;re two different sizes, one is too big for me so it might work on men&#x27;s nails or toe nails.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my boyfriend &amp; he loves them. I dont like to share so now ge has his own set, hehehe</li>
    <li> Every time I go and get my pedicure, I take it with me. I really don&#x27;t like using the salons tools, I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s fungus feet they have worked on. So I love having my own tools!</li>
    <li> These are great for giving myself pedicures. And the (insanely cheap) price can&#x27;t be beat! Solid, heavy-duty, sharp edges...what more could I want?</li>
    <li> I love this set it actually came with more then I thought it did and they are a really nice quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Got my stuff! I love everything but the cuticle cutter. My cuticle cutter kept getting stuck! Not easy to open. But other than that sucking I like my other tools.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, the cuticle cutter could be sharper in my opinion, sometimes I have to pull to separate the cuticle and retry 2 or 3 times.</li>
    <li> Both items were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> A little sharper than I expected but great product</li>
    <li> It was worth it so inexpensive came sooner then expected date. Work good nothing was broken i was a lil scared it would be cheap made but nope! Totally worth it. Thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t complain too much, but the cuticle pushers are excellent while the clippers are really bad. They are exceedingly dull.</li>
    <li> For the price, these tools are great. Solid, stable action on all 3 tools. They work well. I will buy more when the need arises. Make sure you order them well in advance because from the when the order was placed to being received is 30 days...</li>
    <li> This is great love it, its so nice. The price was great I like it for my nails I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting to get such a nice set, they are sharp and do a fine job around cuticles. At this price I will order a few more sets for my friends!</li>
    <li> Fell apart the day after they arrived</li>
    <li> The clippers broke the first time I used them , the other 2 are ok, and I am not unhappy because heck they were cheap what do expect!</li>
    <li> Product is made from a hefty metal, not sure if it is steel, aluminum, or a mixed alloy but it does have some weight which helps when working on a sensitive area such as the cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get is what you see in the picture, and all the edges on all the instruments that were shipped to me were sharp enough to function as they were intended.  The 2 cuticle pushers (1 with blade and 1 with hook) were sharp enough to scrape and position the cuticles with the appropriate amount of effort.  The cuticle cutter was sharp enough to cut the cuticles with the intended precision without having to pull and tear (which is not the way it was designed to function).  Both pushers have a tread-like pattern that helps with grip which is definitely appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used them the day I got them and am pleased with the results and am even more pleased that this set cost me under $3 for everything (including shipping).  I&#x27;ll have to confess that I was actually looking for a more shovel-like device that would be able to cut the cuticle line (once pushed up) from one end to the other, but knowing how my clumsy big hands could easily apply to much pressure in the wrong direction, I think the cuticle nipper might be a safer way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am pleasantly pleased with my mistake in purchase, got what was pictured, durable enough to last a lifetime with proper care, worked as intended, and hard to believe that this is being offered at the price it selling for.  Am very pleased and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> When I received this item I was happily surprised by the quality of both the nippers as well as the cuticle pushers.  Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> The cuticle pushers are phenomenal!!!!!!! Very much worth it-----the cuticle nippers on the other hand were complete garbage. They won&#x27;t even clip anything. Luckily the pushers made this purchase worthwhile for me!!</li>
    <li> This is professional quality and costs almost nothing.  I was really impressed with the weight of the tools and how sharp the nippers are.</li>
    <li> arrived before due date. very nice set for the money. very sturdy.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the fact that the cuticle pushers were sharp and work well, however, I had purchased this product for the cuticle nippers which were not up to my expectations.  They are not sharp, and they don&#x27;t cut the dead skin, they just flatten it.  Additionally, these were advertised as stainless steel, which they may be, but there is no engraving on them that states that they are stainless steel, nor is there anything on the packaging that says so.</li>
    <li> Great sizes and I love the price. It a great bargain when you get year three professional tools for so cheap.</li>
    <li> Its worth what you paid &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;The nail trimmer is pretty sharp to, something I didn&#x27;t expect.&lt;br /&gt;Wham, Bam, Applesauce.</li>
    <li> I was kinda effie when I ordered these but to my surprise they were really good.. heavy weight and they work very well.</li>
    <li> The cuticle pushers are great, the nippers, not so much.  Kind of dull.</li>
    <li> It is very small. I can not remove the cuticles properly because not cut well. Now I bought another brand</li>
    <li> These are not precision instruments.  They&#x27;re somewhat bulky and difficult to wield.  That being said, for the price, I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  They&#x27;ll do just fine as an &amp;#34;emergency/in a pinch&amp;#34; solution for a hangnail.  I plan to leave this little kit in my desk at work, not to replace the higher quality set I have at home.</li>
    <li> German product, I think they are very well made. I get clean cuts everytime and havnt nicked myself once with the clippers, and Ive used the cuticle cutter to break acrylic off (soaking wasnt doing the job). The \\&quot;pushers\\&quot; are nice because of the two sizes. I was told not to use metal pushers, but I have to say, these are wonderful. Will buy productt again, if needed.</li>
    <li> I waited for a long time for these to arrive and when they did the Nippers are so dull they won&#x27;t even trim my cuticles.  Darn, I was really hoping for a quality product.  I don&#x27;t recommend at all.  Back to my favorite nail salon for me!</li>
    <li> The cuticle pushers are too sharp and scrapes off my nails....and the cuticle trimmer just broke as soon as I tried to use it for the first time....I guess that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so cheap</li>
    <li> It wouldn&#x27;t cut through ANYTHING. Dull and worthless. It doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star.. Went straight to the trash can</li>
    <li> These tools are professional grade,  I would recommend these to anyone needing them.  They are also really affordable.  This is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and great tools. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not liking it.</li>
    <li> The set seems sturdy and big enough to handle for larger hands, however, the nail clippers did not hold up. The mechanism that joins together to enable the clippers&#x27; spring action was bent and unable to fix. I would suggest changing those to the kind that you can spin and attached to one side.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with it. It&#x27;s amazing&lt;br /&gt;I recommended to every one need a good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot :)</li>
    <li> THIS WAS WHAT I EXPECTED.  GOOD QUALITY, GREAT PRICE, DELIVERED ON TIME.</li>
    <li> just what you need in this little kit. just like the ones they use in the salons where they do your nails at.</li>
    <li> These are great for the price, very good material, they do not feel cheap at all. I use these with every manicure.</li>
    <li> All 3 products were packaged separately and worked great. I specifically bought these for ingrown toenail care &amp; they work great. Love both sizes of cuticle pushers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some reviews about the cuticle nippers, I found the pair I received to be solid &amp; sturdy, sharp blades and easy to use. These are probably my 7 or 8th pair I&#x27;ve purchased over the years and excellent quality, I&#x27;d expect them to be priced around $12-15 range honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside was the length of time to receive the product, the did come in faster than originally quoted but took a tad over 2 weeks to be received (S&amp;H was free FYI)</li>
    <li> Cuticle pushers are solid and work great.&lt;br /&gt;Nipper is a piece of crap. It&#x27;s a shame because the edges of the nipper are sharp enough, but there is an issue with the mechanism and it doesn&#x27;t cut properly. I&#x27;ve ordered two sets of these and both nippers from each set were defective.</li>
    <li> I didnt use the other tools it came with yet though they seem professional and sturdy. I used the nippers. The nippers are bit dull, but still functional. I loved the pricing, and these are going to be my back up ones anyway. If you purchase these, you might have to get them sharpened or try and sharpen them yourself, but you really cant beat the pricing.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product.  The metal is heavy duty and it has a weighty feel to it.</li>
    <li> This products are for my personal use, I like doing my nails myself. They compare very good with products costing $10 or 15 dollars at the pharmacy. They are very sturdy and have a great edge. The quality is  above my expectations.</li>
    <li> These are heavyweight and effective. The nippers are sharp and the cuticle pushers are also of nice quality. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Love these tools. Great quality and sturdy. Very pleased with these and what a great price. Would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Received items very quickly.  Extremely well priced and clippers are quality of much more expensive ones. The pushers re not very good and I wasn&#x27;t really interested in them.  The price for just the clippers is well worth it,</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described and arrived quickly! The items were nice and heavy and work very well. I was very pleased with this purchase and it was a great value.</li>
    <li> Great Quality tools works great thus far, however I honestly thought the nipper to be bigger (to be able to nip acrylic) however I would recommend the nipper for use in the Manicure Service. It&#x27;s too small for acrylic, however I&#x27;m loving the Curettes and I recommend them for my students and others. Sanctuary Nail Care (Mel Trinidad)</li>
    <li> With the items being put at such a low cost, I thought for sure the quality would not be that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT the case here! I suggest these products to anyone who is contemplating buying them.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping &amp; handling process is a bit long BUT Definitely worth the extra week or so.&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND !</li>
    <li> Set is new and is sharp. it is made of stainless and is of fairly good quality. item is just as described.</li>
    <li> These are professional quality items and I was so surprised at how great they are. They are the same ones that are used in the salon when i go for a manicure or pedicure. What a deal!</li>
    <li> Came in sooner than expected delivery date! love it</li>
    <li> Love the cuticle and nail tools. The clipper started jamming on me early on in use, I had to buy a replacement in a few months.</li>
    <li> The only reason I put a low rating on this item was the length of time it took to get to me. I ordered in early November 2013 and just received this today 1/3/2014. I understand that the holiday mail was part to blame. I guess the frustrating part for me was that we could not just track the item to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I got them and I love them. The smaller utensil is just right for pushing back cuticle and trimming. While the larger one does the same for the toes!&lt;br /&gt;The nippers are good for trimming off dead whatever. They aren&#x27;t as sharp as I would have liked but they work.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your help in searching for and finally resending them to me. That rates very high with me. It also makes me feel comfortable to order from you again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> the work amazingly well for the price! as good as any expensive brand.</li>
    <li> Not thee best, didn&#x27;t stay sharp for long! Hence the price!</li>
    <li> Great price, but never received the items.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and looks exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> It arrived earlier than it was supposed to.  Which was great.  It is a good tool for the price don&#x27;t get carried away with cause you can damage your nail bed, but it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> came on time very well packed good price made well .Nice set for anyone who dose there on nails that look good.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! The cuticle nipper broke on the first use, its nicely sharpened but the medal part in the middle feel off. The 2 piece &#x27;push back/file&#x27;&#x27; are nice and seem more heavy duty then the nipper. I wouldnt purchase again.</li>
    <li> The tools are a good weight, and seam to be good quailty. Shipment was only 11 days after order, even tho the earliest im suppose to recieve them is in two weeks from now. Im so excited to use them tomorrow, just in time to redue my nails. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Each piece is separately wrapped. The cuticle pushers are great one for toes and one for hands and has a blade that isn&#x27;t sharp to the touch but will shave off calluses nicely. The nippers are smaller than expected but sharp and made in Germany. Overall a great purchase!</li>
    <li> JUST LIKE THE TOOLS THAT THE NAIL TECHNICIAN USES IN THE NAIL SALON. VERY GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE DOING HER OWN NAILS</li>
    <li> These are VERY nice quality products! Heavy and sturdy when using. And the clippers are SHARP!</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Impressed with how well these worked. For the low price this was a great buy!</li>
    <li> my nipper was bent... so you couldn&#x27;t cut any cuticle.</li>
    <li> My husband uses on his nails and it works day and my daughter to he is happy to have it</li>
    <li> I expected ok quality. It was a nice surprise that I didn&#x27;t regret the purchase</li>
    <li> I am not happy about this purchase... wasn&#x27;t expensive at all but I did loose some money - not enough to argue with the seller.  I wanted the Cuticle Nipper and the cuticle push tool was just a bonus.  The nippers were embarrassingly dull and actually made my cuticle bleed from &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; the skin and not cutting - DO NOT BUY!!! I almost think these were pre-used, not cleaned up, and just packaged out... but this is just speculation because of the quality of what was received.  I threw away the Nippers but kept the cuticle push tool because these actually worked pretty good.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a way to save on all the mani/pedis per month and this was the perfect way. Not only are the prices cheaper than your local stores but they are the actual products that the nail techs use. I have used them several times since arrival, which was on time. I am happy about this purchase!</li>
    <li> These tools work much better than the ones I bought at the beauty supply store or the ones from the drug store - heavier, sturdier metal, much more effective with less effort. Extremely pleased! With my other tools, I have to work much longer to remove cuticle to prep nails for enhancements - the pusher and scraper removed cuticle material in just one sweep. They feel great in my hand too - a little thicker and heavier than the others, they&#x27;re somewhat easier to control. I am very satisfied with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> It took forever for these to come in, at least a month. I only got two of the pieces included. They&#x27;re nothing special but the price is decent.</li>
    <li> I use these tools in modeling, so my review is not for manicurists and self-users.  The tools are great for modeling, though.  :o)</li>
    <li> I would never buy this product again. The nipper is really bad and not working properly. Doesn&#x27;t cut my cuticles smoothly but instead rips them off.</li>
    <li> The cuticle nippers are the reason I bought this set, and you get what you pay for. I found it does snip very well, so it kind of pulls the skin. The other tools are okay though.</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price I paid however, in the picture it seems that I&#x27;m suppose to get 2 different size cuticle nipper but I received the same one. Anyway, it&#x27;s good quality so still worthwhile and it&#x27;s not made in China.. I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Pretty sturdy material, cuts the cuticles very well, can&#x27;t complain.  My sister even likes to take it away to use it.</li>
    <li> Great set at a great price.  I really needed them and would recommend to others.  Good quality and works well.</li>
    <li> Only 4 stars, because the nail/cuticle clipper was missing a bit of one of the blade tips (btw, it went in the trash), but the cuticle pushers made up or it. For the price paid, I&#x27;m very happy! Great tools.</li>
    <li> Hard to believe that for under three bucks, I got three high-quality manicure tools! The cuticle nipper is nice and sharp and seems well-made. The tool with the flat-ish spoon type thing is awesome! I guess you push your cuticles back with that. I&#x27;ve never used one before, but it works really well. And the third tool with the sharp slanted edge is great for getting in the sides of your fingers and toes to get loose skin, scrape off old polish, etc. And they shipped it fast too!</li>
    <li> I love this product I will order it again in a heart beat, and they are wonder,&lt;br /&gt; and I will tell my friend about them if they are looking for a product like this. Thank You</li>
    <li> well dis is relly gud n i get exactly wat i buy n wat i c on d picture n it is realy gud for personal n profetional use really n a wonderfull customers service</li>
    <li> Love the set, exactly what I needed and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it, extra sharp for those Rough hard to cut nails, it shipped real fast too, definitely going to be ordering more from this company keep up the good work</li>
    <li> The cuticle pushers/ picks were perfect, however, the cuticle nippers were dull.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with it over-all, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars because it is of great quality. For the price I paid I was expecting  something that looked cheaper but it exceeded my expectations and works very well.</li>
    <li> took forever to arrive, but great product.</li>
    <li> I love this set, I always get nails done at the salon and every month I get a pedicure and I know they sterilize their tools but I feel safer taking and using my own. Also this set is great to do your own pedicure at home.</li>
    <li> Great price for the kit.</li>
    <li> I was using the tools from travel kit without any complaint, but it seems to become more tiring to work with such small tools.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these and they are full size which means less strain on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I love the quality too.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by these, especially for how inexpensive they were. I was worried about the cuticle nipper being dull or clumsy but so far it has worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I finally got these tools in &amp; used them to take off my gel polish &amp; then to get my nails ready for my gel manicure, and they rock! I felt like I went to a salon to get my nails done but I didn&#x27;t have to pay $40 for it! I definitely recommend buying these tools if you are an avid at-home manicurist.</li>
    <li> The clippers don&#x27;t appear to be hardened steel, the metal collapsed within seconds of use.  I was also surprised that they came in a package that was a knockoff of a German brand.  The cuticle tools are OK, but just OK.  If you&#x27;re serious about your nails, you need to find a much better product.  Not bad enough to complain about, at the price, but I certainly would NOT buy again or recommend them.  I&#x27;m very surprised by the poor quality.</li>
    <li> got it on time I like it and the nail nipper is a good size not big not small good price</li>
    <li> I bought these for inclusion in my home pedicure set and could not believe the quality of these tools for the price I paid.  They are heavy, solid, and sharp (be careful!).</li>
    <li> This is te perfect set!! The cuticle clippers are te best set I have owned in years and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I really Love this product. Helps me to my nails without spending tons of money at a salon. Def recommend</li>
    <li> This product toooookkkkk forever to get here. I was actually very concerned about it not getting here. After a month and a half it finally got here. I was really happy with the product. They are great and feel very professional . Would recommend this product to some would like to do there own nails and want a professional result</li>
    <li> Take to long to deliver  good quality just take like 1month  everything else is great for the price quality product</li>
    <li> I expected much cheaper quality (considering the price) than what was delivered.  These tools are heavy and of high quality.  You&#x27;ll be impressed, too.</li>
    <li> Very good product, the nail trimmer is made in Germany, very good quality and works great. The other tools are great as well to remove old gel from nails</li>
    <li> Very low quality! I got what I&#x27;ve payed for! They are too rough  and almost unusable for me. Just scissors are normal</li>
    <li> The nippers state Solingen, Germany. Now later I find them definitely not such quality; still very sharp, but the \\&quot;spring\\&quot; does not hold it&#x27;s position and awkward to use. So I would say the Revlon ones which cost more, are a much better buy. The tweezer which I liked much, bend at the slightest, good for super light weight duty - so worth the pennies, no more -</li>
    <li> The cuticle nippers come in a Solingen Germany packaging. The other two tools are fairly solid feeling and seem sturdy. The longer tool with the pick on the end is well made, but the other one with the angled blade to clean under the nail is not properly finished. It has an uneven edge which can be dangerous to use.</li>
    <li> Good quality nail tools. Although, the shipping took around 2 weeks, it was all worth it! The tools are better than grocery store bought, they are sharp and seemed to fit for professional use as well.</li>
    <li> Great value and even though they were shipped from China arrived before the expected deliver date.  I bought several items from the store for my daughters No chip manicure set including these tools.  I ended up giving the entire gift extra early at Thanksgiving and it was such a hit my 2 nieces also wanted the same gift.  So I&#x27;ve actually reordered this set for a total of 3 sets. So I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> How in the world did I go so long without these tools.  Makes taking off the gel products much easier and for pushing the cuticles back.  They are sharp.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I haven&#x27;t had any complaints. The product is like I thought it would be. Thank you.</li>
    <li> i dont know why every else is complaining about a $2.00 and change product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this set and for that price u just cant beat it. at the beauty stores these cost about $10 &amp; up and are also made in china... my cuticle tools are amazingly the best cuticles tools ive ever owned..cant live without. the nail trimmer is also just perfect the size is a little smaller than expected but it gets the job done right. overall i was impressed</li>
    <li> These are solid well made items. Sharp and durable. hard to ask for more. They seem well made and do the job.</li>
    <li> The pushes work well. The trimmer feels a bit cheap though. Just well at first but got dull fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to do my own nails at home. The tools are well made and sturdy, don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;ll fall apart on me. Great price.</li>
    <li> Came in perfect separate little plastic bags which was nice and they work just as good as any good ones from the store</li>
    <li> these are amazing. they dont hurt. theyre gentle. they work wonderful and they arent cheaply made in the least. theyre heavy enough to handle</li>
    <li> It looks like it is made of good quality materials.  It serves the purpose for what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use cuticle nippers, so no opinion there.&lt;br /&gt;The tool pictured on the left is the one I like.&lt;br /&gt;The tool pictured in the middle I think is way to harsh for cuticles.  Don&#x27;t like it. So I use it for carving clay. Not good for nails or cuticles at all.</li>
    <li> Needed a good set to do my manicure and pedicure and this was it.  Professional grade tool to get the job done right.</li>
    <li> I ordered thinking that most likely it would be of very low quality, but since all I needed was a push tool I thought I give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Well I was very pleasantly surprised, they are of good quality and the nippers cut cleanly.</li>
    <li> I thought that the quality was going to be better. But once I used the cuticle clippers it broke. Wont recomend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I really wanted one of these cuticle clippers after seeing the lady use one at the nail salon when I got a manicure. This one seemed decent enough and I loved the price. I purchased it and saw that it was going to take about 2 months to ship! I did order over the holiday season, but 2 months is just ridiculous! Since the price was so nice I was willing to wait. So I waited and waited and waited. 3 months later, I still haven&#x27;t received the clippers and I doubt I ever will. I guess I&#x27;m just out the money. Oh well, at least wasn&#x27;t much. Last time I will ever purchase something from this seller though.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that these utensils can be sterilized before and after use.  Moreover, it assist me in doing pedicures in between going to the nail shop.</li>
    <li> The cuticle pushers/ picks were perfect, however, the cuticle nippers were dull. I was pleased with it over-all, would recommend.</li>
    <li> it is not exactly what I expected, but good for the price. what I like the most is the fast shipping they provided</li>
    <li> Was very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> Not worth the wait that was over a month, not to mention the nippers themselves don&#x27;t align at the bottom so you have to constantly readjust. Don&#x27;t blow your money here!!</li>
    <li> good quality for this price.</li>
    <li> Great price, product just as described and arrived earlier than anticipated. Pretty good.</li>
    <li> The cuticle cutter is sharp and does the job.  These are not high end products but they work just fine for the price.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and that&#x27;s all that matters they did come from China though so they took a few weeks to arrive</li>
    <li> The nippers dont really work that well but the other 2 do!.. Shipping is fast tho</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll have to wait forever for these to come from China.  The good news is they are high quality at a great price.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> The nail cuticle nipper is of OK quality. But the cuticle pusher works. The nipper isn&#x27;t the same quality used at the nail salon. If I had to purchase again I&#x27;d skip this set and spend the money on a better quality instead.</li>
    <li> i like them but the little clippers break very easily</li>
    <li> I wanted the two long implements, as I already had a pair of Revlon clippers, but honestly, these clippers work far better than the Revlon clippers do.  The clippers will leave a small indent in the palm of your hand when using them, but they cut really well, so you don&#x27;t have to use/grip them for long.  Overall, these were a great deal for the low price.  I am happy.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I only received the cuticle nipper and it did not arrive with the other contents as advertised. I made a complaint to them and they said that they would send the other contents and that was over a month ago and they still have not sent it. Don&#x27;t buy from this company. They appear to be scammers.</li>
    <li> Nice and useful. Great for travel and for home. Affordable and easy to use everybody will love it, Thanks for posting this item on amazon.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome, even if I really only got it for the cuticle clipper. They all are heavy and seem goo quality.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT TO PURCHASE EVEN THOUGHT IT TAKE SOME TIME TO GET IT, BUT IT PAYS OFF GREAT PRICE. DEFINITELY A BUY!!</li>
    <li> My wife thought this set would be unusable at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure its not USA stainless,  however, a nice set for people that don&#x27;t want to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;invest $$$  for something they may use a few time a year.</li>
    <li> Nice set for professional use.  I will buy another set in future.  Shipping was a little slow, but good product.</li>
    <li> These nail tools were just was I was looking for at a very reasonable cost.  They are well made for the money.</li>
    <li> The trimmer and nippers are very sharp and does a very good job. You will not regret this purchase. I will be buying another as a gift</li>
    <li> I got these not expecting too much, but they are awesome! they work so well, and they are super easy to clean. each little tool at the end is super handy with whatever kind of nails you are dealing with. I would but this product 100 times over again.</li>
    <li> Knowing that these were coming from abroad I put the delivery anticipation in the back of my head knowing it usually takes months for orders to arrive to me in the US. I received the package exactly 21 days. I wondered what item had arrived the package felt heavy. When I opened it I was surprised first because the order arrived so quickly and second they are heavy quality items. These beauties work amazingly. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Keep this by the sink to keep nails clean</li>
    <li> Everything was what I wanted. Very well made. This is not cheap stuff!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to order this, my advise is do so!</li>
    <li> Exactly what needed for manicures. Nice quality and can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Work well and will last for quite a while. A definite must have for any nail enthusiast.</li>
    <li> tools do work, quality no the best one. I guess you get what you par for. not so excited about...</li>
    <li> these are very good quality, nice construction, sharp edge havent used clipper yet though. good value for what i needed</li>
    <li> These are the best products! I have spend so much money on clippers and tools at high end stores and these are the best ever! Going to go ahead and reorder to have a spare set!</li>
    <li> the nippers didn&#x27;t quite work for me, i think they broke but i love both of the pushers, so two out of three ain&#x27;t bad</li>
    <li> I love this three-piece nail kit. I so needed all three for ever now. It Was a great price I bought it, I&#x27;m very please with it.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get to me but that&#x27;s because it was shipped from Asia so that&#x27;s understandable. Everything is salon quality so good deal for good price.</li>
    <li> I purchased the set of &amp;#34;World Pride Pocket Nail Cuticle Nipper Pack Contains Nail Trimmer&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s been working very well so far. They seems to be sturdy and I don&#x27;t have any problem with them at all.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for CHEAP and they are anything BUT! They work fantastic and are very solid metal. Heavy even! I love!</li>
    <li> i love to clean and polish my own nails these nail trimmer are very useful in cleaning my cuticles the nipper is sharp and works well in cutting away unwanted cuticle glad i bought this set, price and delivery were great too</li>
    <li> I had never really used any kind of tool like this but have recently started getting into doing my nails and figured I should pay more attention to my cuticles and what not. These tools were a really affordable option for all 3 items so I went ahead and ordered them. They got here within 2 weeks, that was 3 weeks before the estimated delivery window! Using them was really easy and actually made quite a bit of difference in how my nails looked so I&#x27;m happy with that as well.</li>
    <li> I loved this Pocket Nail Cuticle Pack. I use them all the time and for the price it was just perfect.</li>
    <li> An amazing product for an incredible price. All three items were very good quality, and surprisingly heavy for their price. The cuticle nippers work like a dream. I only use one of the pushers because I have very small nails, but it works better than anything I have ever used. I&#x27;ve read reviews stating the pushers were too sharp and scraped the nail bed. I doubt this was happening as it removes the parts of cuticle that made it up the nail bed and does no damage to my nails.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter at Christmas time. Because she is always doing her nails and trying different nail colors and tips on the perfect nail. She loveds the set</li>
    <li> Very good quality. They&#x27;re kind of heavy and the little clippers are sharp</li>
    <li> The clippy scissors aren&#x27;t very sharp, so they rip the skin, but all in all for what I paid, a good set. The other two tools are awesome!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these products for well over a year now, and I still use them weekly with exceptional results. They are sturdy, the clippers are sharp, and..well.. they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Clippers do no cut, very dissatisfied w them.  No problems w other tools but clippers was main thing I wanted.</li>
    <li> Ive seen cuticle pusher and nippers before, and Ive wanted a really good one (i had one before from Marshals, it was good for a time then it started to suck because it was too small)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i bought this and when it came, i was really happy! the nippers are the same ones they sell on Born Pretty, but with the two pushers, this is a fantastic deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im pretty sure that Born Pretty nippers are more $$$, so I would buy this to more bang for you buck~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I should have known that this would be garbage based on how cheap they were but I thought maybe it was a clearance sale item or something.  Items came RUSTED and looking USED!  Disgusting!  They are going straight in the garbage.</li>
    <li> The cuticle cutters were not great.  Wish I could use them, but I guess they were cheap. Don&#x27;t recommend. I will continue the hunt</li>
    <li> I brought 3 sets to try the nippers (each set has 1 big head pusher, 1 normal head pusher, &amp; 1 nipper). The nipper by Nghia is very expensive. This is only $1 each. These nippers are ok. I think these tools belong to the odd lot of the manufacture. I brought 3 sets and only 2 of the nippers are usable and all pushers are usable. One of the style of the pusher is too big. The head of the pusher is too big and cause discomfort. I couldn&#x27;t tell where I was pushing on the cuticle when I used the big head pusher. Maybe I need more practice on this design.  The other pusher is normal, has a normal head and easy to push. Overall they are okay for the price. Like I said I think these are odd lot or rejects of the factory. They haven&#x27;t been polished and buffed to a final shine look like the expensive nippers. The nippers are sharp to cut the cuticle without pulling or causing tear of the skin. But one of the nipper is defective and it won&#x27;t close and the other close on the top end and open on the bottom end. Only one out of 3 closes like it should. But I can still use the one that close on the top. So calculation wise: 1 out of 3 are normal and that&#x27;s 33% I got a good set and 67% defective sets; individual calculation total 9 tools and only 2 nippers are defective so 72% are good and 22% are bad. But then I compromise. The size of the nipper was okay for me but small for my brother but he compromise too. Can&#x27;t get everything for $1 each. I might buy more and get use to them. Yasaka and Nghia are too expensive but they are the best. I buy a few of those for executive clients.</li>
    <li> I am someone who always reads customer reviews before I buy anything to see whether or not I should buy it and I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews for this product. Many people say that its a waste of money or that their items came broken or broke as soon as they used them. (I think some people may have been using the cuticle nippers for cutting nails which they are NOT meant to do and will cause them to break. They are meant for cutting cuticles, hangnails, etc.) Those reviews scared me and made me think twice before I bought them and had me scared as I waited for them to arrive. However, after waiting almost a month I finally received them and I am very pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if they cuticle nippers are made from solid steel, but they are sharp and cut my cuticles and and hangnails very easily. The cuticle pushers work excellently with the small one being for fingers and the larger one for toes. The small cuticle pusher has a scraper on one end that is perfect for scraping off dead cuticles or even nail polish that won&#x27;t come off from your nails. The larger pusher has a hook end that I use for cleaning under the nails or helping with checking for ingrown toenails.&lt;br /&gt;With these items being so cheap and coming from China, It probably is a gamble not knowing how they are going to come. But I highly recommend that if you are thinking of purchasing these items, you should try them. Where else can you get a cuticle nipper and two cuticle pushers for such a cheap price? And if they dont work, its not like you spent a fortune to buy them.</li>
    <li> I have not stop using this set since I got them.  They are Firm, Not Cheap and Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> The nippers could be a little nicer, but the tool set is very nice.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price</li>
    <li> The set is nice and does its job very well. The set is of good quality and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the product, works well.  I was able to give my daughter a nice manicure :)</li>
    <li> This set is wonderful.  The snippers are nice and sharp to clean up those pesky hangnails and creeping cuticles. The tools are heavy and high quality.  Quite a good bargain for this meager price!</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality and fantastic product</li>
    <li> I got way more than expected with these! They are great quality for a killer price! Ordered another set for a friend!</li>
    <li> I love them they very good for the price but the cuticle nippers need a bit of shaping in the blades, so the can trim better and to give a better angle for the manicurist to work better.</li>
    <li> I really purchased these tools for the nail clippers. The price is great just for the nail clippers alone. I&#x27;ve used the other tools too and I like them too.</li>
    <li> These are great, just what I needed to help remove my acrylic nails! I won&#x27;t need to order anything else!</li>
    <li> I wanted the nail clippers, they are only fair quality, the other tools look useless to me. They are something that should be used in a workshop, maybe. I wanted to have a good cuticle pusher. Big mistake. The tools from the set are very heavy metal and would damage the nail surface, possibly the nail bed. I found orange sticks on Amazon from Boolavard. The orange sticks are good quality and each person gets to have her own cuticle pusher. I think I will be happy with them.</li>
    <li> I saw these tools along with the price and just had to buy them! Super cheap and shipped faster than I expected. They&#x27;re the real deal nail salon tools and I love using them when I do my nails along with others&#x27;!</li>
    <li> But I didn&#x27;t like the actual nipper.  Its not sharp but for how fast it came and the other tools, absolutely worth the price.  I will inevitably lose and reorder!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this and i love it, great price , great product and graet timing got it just in time as promissed.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was expecting! Got it alot sooner than expected also.... Definitely worth the price and the wait</li>
    <li> This product was as described and you always need a cuticle cutter when you least expect it. Great for travel</li>
    <li> this product is okay, it works really well, except for that the cuticle cutters do not offer much resistance anymore</li>
    <li> Great quality ! I was amazed with how inexpensive this product was, &amp; how sturdy &amp; durable the item is.</li>
    <li> Excellent... Good quality and value for your money. A very good buy! I would recommend this product to another customer.</li>
    <li> works lovely no complaints thanks thats great buisness. very pleased with promt ness and was a discribbed very good. thumbs</li>
    <li> This tools are great I&#x27;ve used already for my manicure and the were wonderful. Very inexpensive but they have great quality. It worth the wait.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included cuticle cutter (\\&quot;cuticle nipper\\&quot; as it&#x27;s called on the cover, which I thought was a cute name :) and two additional pieces arrived as expected, but they are of poor quality. I don&#x27;t know what else I was expecting with a 3-piece set that costs under $3. I&#x27;m still giving these a 3-star rating because they did arrive as described, and look like the items in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived in about 2 weeks from China, which was quicker than the stated delivery time, but 2 weeks is a lot longer than most items you order on Amazon so it felt like it took forever, especially for such a low payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuticle cutter is extremely dull. For me, that makes it unusable, as I find myself tearing to remove the partially cut cuticles. I guess these will get the job done as long as you don&#x27;t mind bleeding fingers. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m throwing these away and buying a real pair. My fingers are worth it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I was able to buy the three items for one price.&lt;br /&gt;It was just what I expected</li>
    <li> I was expecting flimsy tools and didn&#x27;t really care since it is just for home use. I was pleasantly surprised that these tools are very heavy and sturdy. Should last a while. They take forever to arrive but they come from China so I was okay with the wait.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs (nail art and acrylics). Is exactly as described. Arrived before the scheduled time and was in pretty good packaging.</li>
    <li> This product is poorly made.</li>
    <li> a good deal for the price</li>
    <li> I like these items, and the price was excellent. I use these regularly in my profession. An excellent low end product.</li>
    <li> Clipper not sharp at all and pulls rather than trim/cut.  I received the exact same 2 tools with the trimmer, and they look nothing like what&#x27;s in the picture.  This is made from cheap metal and is not worth the money.  Packaging says it&#x27;s made in Germany but the shipment is form China and took a month to get here. The junk is being trashed.</li>
    <li> I say this is a great buy. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much quality for the price, but my expectations were exceeded! I have paid so much more for less quality in the past.</li>
    <li> everything worked great, scissors were very sharp.</li>
    <li> I like the product however it was not packaged properly. It was very loose thrown in the bag, none of the materials inside were packaged. I did sanitize them however it would have been nice to at least have some plastic cover to ensure this product was not being used before and just sent to a customer. I was very upset how this was packaged.</li>
    <li> Works great for an awesome&lt;br /&gt;Price !!</li>
    <li> The nippers became stiff.  I tried to oil them which helped a little but still can&#x27;t use them properly.</li>
    <li> Only received one out of the three pieces to the set therefore rating a one star.</li>
    <li> Everything came exactly as pictured, and the tools work just like the ones you see in nail salons. Very affordable and very useful!</li>
    <li> the quality is good for the price you pay! i haven&#x27;t used the cuticle nipper but can&#x27;t complain about the pushers!</li>
    <li> I really like the cuticle nipper. It is sharp and you can easily nip the cuticles. The other two tools are also helpful.</li>
    <li> These tools are great  Generous size and precision tools for such a reasonable price  These are so easy to use and I will be order another set for my purse thank you for a great product</li>
    <li> This set is great and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;ll admit it took some time to ship but certainly not a month. The nippers are nice. Cuts cuticles effectively without having to pull the skin, it&#x27;s sharpness is a plus. They are nice weight as well. I&#x27;ve used these well over 10 times and they are still going strong. The cuticle pushers of course are great as well, they are basic and get the job done.</li>
    <li> These tools came in their own little plastic sleeves and I was pleased with them. They worked just as I expected them to.</li>
    <li> When I finally received the Nail Kit, it was exactly what I expected and was happy with the set.  The quality seems to be good and works great when doing my Nails.</li>
    <li> Tools are fairly good quality.  They work well to manicure my nails.  (I have natural nails but use gel polish).  The cuticle nippers are better then my previous pair, sharp &amp; accurate.  The other tools I&#x27;ve only used a couple of times, but also seem good quality.</li>
    <li> Very good  product great</li>
    <li> Cuticle nippers don&#x27;t work that good:/</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this item. I previously owned a cuticle nipper and pusher from my local convenience store and the quality of these is FAR SUPERIOR to what I paid much more for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel much more heavy duty than my old ones and the cuticle nippers have a smaller head for more detailed work. I don&#x27;t even care that it took almost a month to get here. For the price, I am not complaining.</li>
    <li> did wonders on my toes</li>
    <li> they are to litle and its hard to work with them</li>
    <li> One of the handles of the cuticle nipper snapped in half within 3 minutes of using the tool.  Not happy with that.  The other tools are great and work as they should.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and great bargain. It&#x27;s the price at Sally&#x27;s, not that I don&#x27;t love Sally&#x27;s. All I have to say is its great quality and very good for getting the job done.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim, for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but the quality is great, professional grade I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I would say that this was a great buy I used and was happy with the outcome that I recieved and I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay these things are nothing fancy its does the job it is suppose to do so I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> The cuticle nippers came in retail packaging that says they are made in germany. They are good quality and sharp but none of the tools are \\&quot;pocket size\\&quot; just normal size which is fine by me. The other two tools came in little plastic pouches, they are not cheaply made and work as they should.</li>
    <li> everything works perfect, i have soaked mines in water, and happy to see that it is not changed in color or become moldy. works llike a charm.</li>
    <li> Second set I ordered because my friends stole my first seat.  It seems to be good enough and they havent broken yet.</li>
    <li> These work great for my at home manicures! I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> I love cuticle pushers it does the job, can&#x27;t say much about the nipper though? It&#x27;s only worth $2 so I am not surprised. Oh well, all I wanted was the pushers anyways I just think of it as the nippers came as a bonus.</li>
    <li> I love these tools. I do my o nails a lot and they come in handy and work great. Excellent price for what you get.</li>
    <li> very nice and heavy duty - these will last a lifetime</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ts amazing, 3 ea fabulosos!!! perfect kit.</li>
    <li> WOW! For the money this set is fantastic. I did not expect them to be this sturdy. The clippers are sharp and the set is very well made.</li>
    <li> The plier cuold be better, the cutting edge is not aligned, therefore it does not cut properly. The other tools are pretty good.</li>
    <li> Great set for a really great price! It made keeping up my manicure a little easier! I have used it these a few times monthly for approx. 6 months and they are still sharp as ever.</li>
    <li> These tools are amazing! Perfect, excellent quality &amp; the price was outstanding. The only flaw was how long it took to get to me. Because they come from Hong Kong. If you aren&#x27;t in any hurry to get them , then I highly recommend you order them, you wont be disappointed. They are well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> super little trio for the money. Work just fine.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, so long as you don&#x27;t mind waiting a while to get it.  It took about two months for this item to ship to me, in the U.S.</li>
    <li> very sharp and it works well, i recommend for anyone who wants to trim their cuticles at home or wherever.</li>
    <li> Love these tools. They are sharp and work great. I use them every time I do my nails. I would recommend. Helps get to places on your nail that you cannot with just nail clippers.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  I cannot believe the quality for such a bargain.  I plan to purchase some more sets for family.</li>
    <li> Nippers r nice n sharp, hope they stay that way for a while, pushers r great sizes r perfect for toes and other for fingers.</li>
    <li> The nail cuticle pack is a wonderful product. I am so glad I bought the package. I highly recommend this packet. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I bought theses thinking\\&quot; oh yeah for what $3.15 theses aren&#x27;t gonna be very good , but what the heck I&#x27;ll try them\\&quot; and WOW am I shocked and in love!!! They are really nice quality. Very well made and heavy duty. There are 2 different size cuticle pushers with the higher on being toes and the smaller one for fingers. The one for toes has a heavy duty curved tip for digging out ingrown toe nails. But I find it works gear for cleaning out the gunk under your fingernails. It also can be used to shape the underneath of the nails....where you can get the natural French tip look. The nippers appear to be from Germany although everything was shipped from China.  I have bought several cuticle pushers and nippers from Sally&#x27;s and Walmart but they were never this nice plus they cost me around $10-$15 for them. The ones I got here are by far the best ones I have ever had and were a STEAL!!!! $3.15 you cannot beat!!!! It&#x27;s like paying close to a $1.00 EACH!!! I still can&#x27;t believe it! Seriously if you are debating get them and you&#x27;ll see exactly what I am talking about. I am actually gonna make an order for _4-8 more. Some for layer jic w I lose them and some for family members. I can&#x27;t remember the seller but it was really fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Great pedicure/manicure tool set. This set works wonders. The cuticle pushers and nipper are easier to clean and they are sturdier than the wooden ones. Great set and great price!</li>
    <li> Tools work well.  Just as described</li>
    <li> These are great for removing those pesky ingrown toenails.</li>
    <li> These tools have helped me get the results that I wanted, so the tools were worth the money spent for sure.</li>
    <li> The price is really good and the products are okay</li>
    <li> Came quickly and is what i wanted. Does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Shipping from China was extremely fast. Product works great..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)</li>
    <li> Since purchasing this set, I swear I use these tools every time I do my nails.  I use the clippers to help with ingrown toe nails, which I have gotten all my life, and I use the other two tools to push down my cuticles and clean underneath my fingernails.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great set at a great price and gets a lot of use from me.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product and the delivery!</li>
    <li> unfortunately the cuticle cutter broke. the handle broke off on my while using it.</li>
    <li> A good quality and easy to use product with a reasonable price tag.&lt;br /&gt;The tools not yet used but appear to be o.k.</li>
    <li> easy to use work good on nails it came on time, Very good quality i love it , thanks for this awesome products</li>
    <li> I love the cuticle cutter. The other tools I never really use too much, but all are sharp and very precise. The cuticle trimmer works&lt;br /&gt;excellent. There is no cover for it so you have to store it carefully.</li>
    <li> The cuticle trimmer was a bit too dull for my taste but great price. Slow shipping though but for that price I can&#x27;t complain about the shipping too much can I?</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the quality of these tools for the price.  I thought that I was going to end up getting some cheap stuff and was quite surprised at the weight of the items.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Cheap cheap cheap.  The clippers are so blunt it doesn&#x27;t even cut.</li>
    <li> The cuticle trimmer started falling apart and wasn&#x27;t sharp</li>
    <li> Good, heavy, and nicely sized.&lt;br /&gt;These are not &#x27;travel sized&#x27; tools.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;cuticle nipper &amp;#34; in none of my 3 packages are sharp , the other 2 tools are amazing</li>
    <li> works good, seems bulky to me compared to my previous set</li>
    <li> they are very sturdy, Love how they came in the mail and they are very good. I was expecting cheap metal and it feel heavy and expensive</li>
    <li> This was a such a great deal and I had been wanting a set of cuticle tools. They took awhile to arrive because it was coming from overseas, but the quality seems pretty good and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> To touch up my cuticles between salon visits or when I do my own it is a decent set for the price.</li>
    <li> I take long time to get this thing. I haven&#x27;t seen it yet. If I get it I gonna tell you about it.</li>
    <li> The nippers are very handy for trimming the excess from nail striping tape.  The other tools I don&#x27;t get much use from, but when I have used them they were handy in prepping the nail bed during manicures and pedicures.</li>
    <li> The pushing tools are ok. The lifting tool is big n bulky as well as the digging tool. The nippers are sharp enough for single use. Opening and closing action is good.</li>
    <li> I buy a TON of stuff on Amazon and reviews are very important in my purchasing decisions.  I bought this pair of cuticle nippers because of the really high reviews, stating things like the clippers are \\&quot;made in Germany\\&quot; and that they are \\&quot;high quality\\&quot;. When I got them I was adequately satisfied because they seemed to do the job. They weren&#x27;t that sharp or precise or a breeze to handle, but hey, you get what you pay for and they did nip.  Well...Last night I was using them to nip an awkward part of my toenail that is normally difficult to reach with regular nail clipper. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have the thinnest toenails, but I can also say that I don&#x27;t have that hard or thick of toenails...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with one regular squeeze of the nippers, without any real perceived force on my end, the nippers break in half and stab my hand with the broken edge.  It did not feel like a solid piece of metal \\&quot;snapping\\&quot;, but more like a bend and crack of flexible plaster in the center or something of the sort.  I investigated the broken edges and I found that it was filled with this black porous material, which obviously is not that strong to have broken in one of my hands clipping a toenail.  Please see the pictures I have attached for clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I was the lucky top reviewer to have received this \\&quot;German made item with warranty information on the package\\&quot; but the pair I got are absolutely not German nor did I see a warranty.  Mine came from China and they are complete rubbish, and I have a blood blister on my hand :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend $10 more dollars and get quality nippers instead of this cheap and now useless set.  I definitely have. Buy these instead:[[ASIN:B001CAZUD4 Cuticle Clipper by Premax. Made in Italy]]</li>
    <li> The nail scrapers are fine. Really heavy duty. The clippers however are really small. I&#x27;ve had several sets of clippers but they were all I guess what you&#x27;d call &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; size. These, however, are more on the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size. Ok for keeping in your purse for emergencies, but not very user friendly for everyday.</li>
    <li> I think these are amazing quality for this price, Good nice metal and i love the tools to get the gunk out from underneath my nails they work really well, i suggest this product over the other ones you can find on amazon.</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to use on the little tags on the sides of my fingers that when ripped to far become a pain in the buttocks. They relieved the pain and with the addition of the cuticle pusher and scraper made my whole nail area look so much nicer. I found to that after receiving this product that other family members had the want to use it as well which must say something.</li>
    <li> Starting to do gel nails I needed these things and to take off the gel polish. Very happy to see all 3 things in a bundle looked for it in town was much more then here. I would buy again great package deal with everything great price would buy again for sure A+++++</li>
    <li> I LOVE these nail tools! Great sturdy material &amp; great price! You can properly clean the nails with these tools!</li>
    <li> i took a chance and wasn&#x27;t amazed or disappointing buying this. The tools (with the exception of the clipper) are very dull and hard to get under/push the cuticles. I would have no problem letting a child play with the cuticle pushers.The clippers, however, are sharp but doesn&#x27;t get close enough to remove everything cleanly. It also took about a month to arrive. this is a good beginner set, maybe you wont need anything better!</li>
    <li> Love it! I take it with me to get a manicure and pedicure.</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 sets of these. One for myself and one as a gift. We both love them!! Had my nails done at a spa and the tools they used were so cheap looking and they kept having to fix them. I have NEVER had a problem with mine and use them all the time.</li>
    <li> Tools a little large, but I will make them work. Thanks</li>
    <li> Wanted to save money by doing my own nails and I love these tools! They help tremendously!</li>
    <li> Amazing price for a high quality product.  I bought a set for my mom, too.  The same tools at a drugstore would be more than $20.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price they work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> They are good for the price. They are heavy and sturdy, however the cuticle nipper is (little scissors) are not the best quality, but they will do the job. They are just a little odd to handle</li>
    <li> This is what I have been looking for. It works just as good as the nail shop. I am happy</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price, just make sure you aren&#x27;t in a hurry, take a while to ship.</li>
    <li> the cuticle clippers were smaller than I imagined but they all work great. All are sharp. They do take about a month to ship but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> Long shopping but over all worth it. Just like the nail salons.</li>
    <li> This came on time. I love this!! I can now do a professional manicure at home i love it!! Works just like the ones at the salons. You cant do a manicure without these!! They do not cost a lot but they work very well. I was so surprised they were this well made . I recommend!</li>
    <li> I was really excited when these arrived because they were exactly what I wanted. They are great quality and perfect for doing your own manis and pedis.</li>
    <li> Less than 3 dollar for something I&#x27;d pay a good 30$ for.&lt;br /&gt;The tools are absolutely amazing. The clipper is sooooo much better than any the old-fashion nail clippers that you see everywhere. It&#x27;s absolutely absurd how much better this design is now that I reflect on it.&lt;br /&gt;Not the mention the usefulness of the other two tools.&lt;br /&gt;The scalpel-like one will not cut your skin (I&#x27;ve tried haha), but feels like an exacto knife on your nails. It&#x27;s an absolute mystery to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far exceeded my wildest expectations.</li>
    <li> i mainly bought this for the cuticle trimmer and it works really well. the pusher tools are a great bonus</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price.  The ends of the tools are kind of dull.  I have drugstore brand tools that work better.  But for the price, they&#x27;re not terrible.</li>
    <li> Find the clippers hard to use</li>
    <li> Took its time being delivered but they are quality.</li>
    <li> Good quality and better yet the price. I was expecting cheap as far a quality and I was amazed at the quality of the items. One of the cuticle pusher the bigger one, the end is very sharp so be carefuk.</li>
    <li> these are awesome definately salon quality built to last and they more than get the job done just be careful not to poke yourself too hard</li>
    <li> So I ordered this item knowing it would take a while to get here, but never did I think it&#x27;d take a MONTH. The Item was sharp at first, now it won&#x27;t take off the slightest hang nail. Not worth the money. Get it from somewhere that has a good return policy.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
    <li> Better than I thought it would be. Arrived quickly and they work great.</li>
    <li> The clipper isn&#x27;t sharp enough, when I clipped my cuticles, it made it look like I bit them instead.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to arrive but I can&#x27;t complain with the quality of the product and the price was unbeatable. Worth the wait!</li>
    <li> clipper tips broke in 2 at first use. Says made in Germany...shipped from China. Suspect it&#x27;s fake!</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for and very good price.</li>
    <li> Great quality product.  I was not expecting much in the terms of quality, but i was pleasantly surprised.  Surgical quality tools and bargain basement price!  Will be able to use for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used all the items. I find them to be of a high quality and easily useable, thereby making these items are good value for money.</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to do. Definitely would purchase again if need be. Arrived in a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> No sharp enough to use</li>
    <li> What a great set at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;How can one go wrong? I dont know why it says mini, the tools are normal sized</li>
    <li> These products are horrible. Broke after first use</li>
    <li> These are great. It was a good price and I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The cuticle trimmer is now my favorite nail tool. I have to keep myself from using it on the nails themselves because it it just so precise.</li>
    <li> Great product, wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect and it is very good quality for the cost.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for personal nail tools, cuticle clipper is not for commercial use at a spa, but great for personal use.</li>
    <li> NOT GOOD  CUTTING PART OF NIPPERS DID NOT COME TOGETHER TO MAKE A CLEAN CUT&lt;br /&gt;ONLY CAME TOGETHER AT THE VERY TIP OF CUTTERS</li>
    <li> They all came with there own containers &amp; they all work really well. I did my friends nails and mine and they looked great!</li>
    <li> Really good price-benefit outcome. It works perfect. You really get the value for your buck. I really like them and use the three pieces.</li>
    <li> Love everything but the cheaply built cuticle trimmer. Otherwise great buy. Cheap and worth the price</li>
    <li> Clippers broke already.</li>
    <li> This was terrible. Granted it was extremely cheap but still. It was not sharp enough to cut my circles and when I really pushed down it got stuck. Tossed in the trash 10 minutes after receipt of product! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> works pretty great :)</li>
    <li> the nippers were a bit rusty but over all  i was happy</li>
    <li> One of them came broke.</li>
    <li> i love them and for the price i cant complain at all. they are exactly what you think they are!</li>
    <li> I was not expecting such a great set.  They are as good, or better, than what is used in most nail salons!</li>
    <li> Came with 1 of the 3 items in original packaging but a quick blech/water rinse is just fine to make sure its santitary. Works great!</li>
    <li> the rest were ok and it looks as it was described i like it but the nipper was not sharp.</li>
    <li> I bought these to do at home manicures.  I have no complaints.  Sturdy products and they get the job done.</li>
    <li> Good quality, works well, reasonable price but took almost 3 weeks to get them</li>
    <li> I bought these for my manicures/pedicures after seeing that this was what they typically use at the salon, and I prefer to bring my own nail supplies.  I brought them for the first time this week, and so far so good.  For the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Great deal heavy duty in quality. I wish the cutical cutters were sharper.</li>
    <li> these things work great</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my product</li>
    <li> This was so cheap I expected it to b so so but it was great quality ! Totally recommend !</li>
    <li> Terrible quality, definitely a waste of money.  They&#x27;re made of some unfinished metal that rusts immediately.</li>
    <li> The quality is excelent and I like that the nippers are smaller and easier too use. Well with the price</li>
    <li> Nice, heavy weight design that won&#x27;t break anytime soon. It makes doing my nails a breeze.  It came all the way from China.</li>
    <li> Great deal and they were excellent quality.  They were delivered within a few weeks, and only a few dollars.  I ordered a few things and got free shipping so it was a win win! Will definitely order this again, and recommend it, if you need some cool nail tools.</li>
    <li> Easy to use tools. Do a great job on my nails.  Can you sharpen the clippers?</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Amazon as a gift for my wife. It took a little while to arrive; but when I received it, it was in good condition and the package  contained the items as described. My wife tried it as soon as I gave it to her. She said it worked good. No complaint. And since then, she has used it regularly. She&#x27;s satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Their cheap but not. In price... They do great! I can use the tools for cleaning, grooming and helping with designing my nails. Their is so much I can do with 3D designs with acrylic. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Pieces are heavy duty but the clippers are very very dull and don&#x27;t really work. It takes some wiggling just right to work.</li>
    <li> Ladies you won&#x27;t find a nicer set then this and set sells for an unbelievable price! This set lets you do more then one thing so why wait when you can make you feet happy!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, I really did. I was especially excited that it was a three pack of tools. The two cuticle pushers (?) were great, which is the only reason this isn&#x27;t a one star review. The cuticle trimmers/nippers are AWFUL. You literally have to pull on the cuticle to get any skin off. They&#x27;re so incredibly dull and essentially just pinch your cuticles really hard until it hopefully breaks the skin. Yuck, I know. Needless to say, they went right in the garbage and I&#x27;ve since picked up a much sharper and precise pair from Trim at Target.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product and love it. The products are a good quality. I used the nippers for the first time and it cuts really great, it&#x27;s very compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> i love this set... i used the nipper and the larger cuticle pusher for my manis... the nipper is light and easy for me to maneuver even with my non-dominant hand. the pusher, i use for when i clean the top of my nails. it&#x27;s also quite affordable.</li>
    <li> The Nipper is not sharp at all. The rest is okay. If you are just getting the Nipper then you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Well made, heavy duty and work great. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great quality and very nice! Doesn&#x27;t rust or anything. Always comes in handy. I love these nail care products ! Definitely recommend them !</li>
    <li> Very slow shipping. It came weeks after other products I ordered on the same day. Good quality though.</li>
    <li> The actual clippers were tiny, there&#x27;s no way you can cut nails with it.</li>
    <li> the  product  is  good  material and  is  as looks as in picture. I will be  buying  more items  and I  recommend this item to any  one  who is looking for good quality  tools</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great set for the price! All the tools in it work so well. I am very impressed. I will never again buy overpriced nippers and pushers!!!</li>
    <li> I dont know how I ever did my nails before, super handy and sharp tools! Love it, a must buy</li>
    <li> I use the cuticle trimmer a lot when I&#x27;m doing my nails, and this set is a really good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> perfect i have had them for about a year and a half now and no complaints and they still look brand new!</li>
    <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
    <li> Works really good and hasn&#x27;t dulled yet.</li>
    <li> Decent products.  Longer wait for delivery than most things I have ordered, but not unreasonable.</li>
    <li> Great cuticle pushers and snipper and the value here is unheard of.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The two pieces to the left were good but the clippers were stiff and really unusable unless I wanted to use for maybe arts and craft. The quality wasn&#x27;t there for the clippers at all but for the price id buy it all over again and maybe even multiple order simply for the 2 pieces to the left. I feel bad giving them four stars because at the end of the day I&#x27;d buy it all over again, but five stars would mean everything was great and the clippers sucked.</li>
    <li> Great Great quality items.. they are sharp and cut true right outta the box..  For the price, I&#x27;d have expected mickey mouse quality, BUT these are actually my new favorite nail trimming and upkeeping products..</li>
    <li> I mostly got this because I needed a new travel cuticle clipper and wanted to try a different style than the one I already have.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well, the packaging was poor.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to own these. The quality is outstanding. Value priced too! I will buy more to give away to family.</li>
    <li> Perfect  product for Jamberry  Nail Wraps !!! Love it!!! Check out the wraps at www.samanthahillmiller.jamberrynails.net</li>
    <li> Responsive customer service.</li>
    <li> Very Cheap products, dull and very bulky., do not recommend.</li>
    <li> The nippers not work well at all. I should have known you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Now I can do my own manicure at home. PERFECT!!!!</li>
    <li> These are great products for the price.  I am very pleased I purchased these and not the more expensive ones at our local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I love my new tools , the  cuticle clipper is not the best but the other two are great. I would reorder. Thanks</li>
    <li> These took a month to come in. The utensils are not as sharp as I need for my nails. They are ok. The price was cheap though, so I&#x27;m not too disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best tools ever and for that price....I mean I can&#x27;t even think of the right words I love them I use them a lot. They are so sturdy and good quality. Love love love</li>
    <li> I have never had these tools before. After receiving them I instantly used them. Makes life with my nails so much better.</li>
    <li> It was worth buying this item which came with 3 parts... unlike the 1 piece i bought for an even higher price...amazon sellers expecially over seas, and out the U.S always have great deals.</li>
    <li> fixed my bad ingrown nails, real relief from pain</li>
    <li> Good quality for a good price.</li>
    <li> i love my supplies that tells the whole story right there</li>
    <li> Very sturdy &amp; good purchase for the price. Better than other sets I&#x27;ve purchased in local stores.</li>
    <li> Great price..just what I needed to do my own pedicures.</li>
    <li> As expected. Took a good minute to ge to me but worth it!</li>
    <li> In the picture the tools look shiner but the color is very dull but it works well</li>
    <li> Strong tools! I will have these for many years.</li>
    <li> Kit was a real good price and worked well. Even though it was cheap in price it wasnt cheap in quality!</li>
    <li> Heavy and durable.  Not at all a cheap set.</li>
    <li> These World Pride Pocket Nail Cuticle Nipper Pack is nice for doing your feet. A must have in your foot care set</li>
    <li> I have been looking for cuticle cutter and I found these. It&#x27;s sturdy and didn&#x27;t expect a good quality for it&#x27;s cheap price but I was impressed.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, and worth waiting for the shipping time from chine, for the cost savings. The cases are cheap and don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> The other reviews I read about  these tools were correct. The quality of these tools are great. I love that its all metal and easy to sanitize and it arrived quickly</li>
    <li> The small size finger scrapper came with a crack and it scratches my nail when I use it. But I still use it just have to be careful. Oh by the way, it came on time like a week after I purchased it. It&#x27;s cheap. No complaint.</li>
    <li> I like these so good that I have ordered 2 more sets~you can&#x27;t beat the Price~I miss-place things, so these are great for me O:)</li>
    <li> I like these products. Good price and the tools seem to work just fine! Just what I needed. Easy and cheap!</li>
    <li> is not sharp and it doesn&#x27;t cut well, I have to buy another because this one doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> All three of these pieces feel solid in your hands; no wondering if you&#x27;re going to break them at all.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the end profile of the rounded portion were a little thinner (I may just break out the metal file and grind them down slightly if it gets to me enough) but other than that I have no complaints at all. I&#x27;ve used them a couple of times over the last two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any rust on any of the pieces.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional aesthetician but I would bet these are strong enough to handle daily abuse with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;They ship directly from Hong Kong and took about three weeks to reach me in the Northeast</li>
    <li> Okay the shipping took like a month. I wasn&#x27;t worried because I had some wooden once at my house. This stuff costs so much at the stores. It works I love this and will never use wooden cuticle pusher ever again. And the trimmer is pretty good too.</li>
    <li> Great quality cuticle pushers and cuticle nippers. They are very durable, too. Would definitely suggest these to other buyers. *former cosmetologist*</li>
    <li> Exceptional tools for the cost. I will buy another set when these start to deteriorate.  I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re made in China, but they&#x27;re better quality than walmart.</li>
    <li> These are a very high quality for such a low price. I ordered it for the clippers, but I have ended up getting a lot of use out of all of the tools. I would highly-recommend this product. Salon quality.</li>
    <li> Great price, for what you get.. Only thing negative about this was how long it took for me to receive. (Over 4 weeks) i had almost forgot i ordered it! lol If you dont mind a wait, its a great deal.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and better quality than any cuticle clippers sold at pharmacys. Ships from overseas so there&#x27;s a little wait for your order but totally worth it. Any issues I&#x27;ve ever had we&#x27;re answered quickly and kindly by this company. I do recommend them!</li>
    <li> This took a long time to come, but I like the quality for the price.  It&#x27;s not professional quality, but I just needed something for personal use.  I would have paid more in town if I would have found something here.</li>
    <li> I am glad i ordered this item! A good pair in the store is at least $10. These are fabulous and are still sharp after a few months. It is a great combination. Get these they are great!</li>
    <li> surprisingly good three piece nail manicure set  i was impressed with the quality and the price was unbelievable.  ill be using you again</li>
    <li> First before you start you&#x27;re gel nail work out start with this nail trimmer this is great to have make my nails look good  ......Love it!</li>
    <li> this is a great product! with a perfect price and totally recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cuticle cutter is sharp which is perfect!</li>
    <li> It wook some time to come but they work and that all i really care about. I use it for self pedicures and they help a lot.</li>
    <li> i only got 2/3 of the tools so can&#x27;t say i&#x27;m thrilled however it was fast shipping and the quality is good</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE. The nipper is the perfect size. The pusher preps the nail so smoothly!!!</li>
    <li> the tools are great, the cuticle nipper is not very sharp.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty. Nice quality. Works amazing. Very happy</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Very good quality for the price</li>
    <li> Easy to use if you know what you&#x27;re doing! Durable and strong</li>
    <li> They look better in the picture I simply got what I pay for at least they work</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the cutical clippers for a long time. They are very sharpe and do the job correctly . The pushers are just the correct size to comfortably be held in the hand. Very Pleased.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the picture came on time</li>
    <li> Amazing set very sharp</li>
    <li> They are very durable, awesome price and I have used them dozens of times.  I recommend using hot water and rubbing alcohol for cleaning,  just to kill the germs after each use!</li>
    <li> I like that 3 tools came in one pack and they each came in their owl little case to keep them clean when stored.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut - you would have to pull to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought as a gift and I am extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets and me and my friend tried it out and we lived it. How ever you need to be careful seeing as they are all very sharp. I do suggest doing a lot of research into how to use them to prevent damage to the cuticle.</li>
    <li> I really looked forward to receiving these. They looked to be good quality and just what I needed. The price was very good but. .  I just wish I&#x27;d gotten them. :(</li>
    <li> Not stainless steel, but a great steal. FOR &amp;#60;$5 YOU CANT GO WRONG amazing quality.&lt;br /&gt;Only cons&lt;br /&gt;took like 3 weeks to ship and receive the item</li>
    <li> I use it every time I do my nails! Not cheaply made as I thought it&#x27;d be.  Worth the buy</li>
    <li> The clippers aren&#x27;t the best..but they do the job. the tools work well, such a good deal for the 3 items! Good Purchase.</li>
    <li> Got these today and tried the nippers out. They are sharp and work great. The other two pieces are exactly the same thing so don&#x27;t understand why they would send two cuticle pushers. One star for fast delivery and one star for Muppets working great.</li>
    <li> The clipper is not very good, I look for very neat and sharp clippers tho. The other two tools are awesome, very useful for pushing cuticles, and overall cleaning after painting them. Its worth to buy!</li>
    <li> These are terrible, they don&#x27;t cut, they pull. Stay away and get Mehaz cuticle nippers for $26, you&#x27;ll be happy@</li>
    <li> The nail trimmer is too sharp and was very painful.&lt;br /&gt;It broke 20 min in using it... looks very stable and strong in the image but it is not really good.&lt;br /&gt;It got another star for the other parts of it - were pretty good</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need - does the job. However, be careful, the pushers and the clipper can do damage to your nails. Be gentle and careful!</li>
    <li> The cuticle nipper was the main reason I purchased this set, and I&#x27;ve honestly never touched the other two tools. For the nipper, I like that the blades align nicely and make a good, clean cut. However, the two piece bow spring system rarely stay aligned. As you can barely make out in the item picture, the two tips of the bowed metal meet in the middle, and rest upon each other in a small groove. They aren&#x27;t bowed enough to actually separate the handles enough to open the blades more than just a tiny bit, so you have to awkwardly reposition your hands to manual open the blade, which causes the bows to separate, which is frustrating. I know this is alot of analysis for a small, simple tool, but it&#x27;s annoying. I much prefer the more expensive Revlon branded nipper that uses a single spring bow that pushes against the opposing arm of the tool.</li>
    <li> Cuticle nipper is very sharp and you have to be careful not to over do it. Other tools seem bit heavy but they are made of steel.</li>
    <li> Looks so cheap just buy at the shop&lt;br /&gt;Not working well&lt;br /&gt;Waste money to buy this stuff&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy here</li>
    <li> Pocket Nail Cuticle Nipper Pack Contains Nail Trimmer, Pack of 3&lt;br /&gt;Better than I expected, good quality items...yes, thumbs up!</li>
    <li> For the money you shelled out, you get a nail clipping set of good quality in material and workmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best, but far better than many cheap sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very decent set at an excellent value</li>
    <li> A little confused by some reviewers. Do they use these cuticle clippers as nail clippers, I think so.&lt;br /&gt;They are well made and are perfect for cuticles. I do not nip my cuticles often, but will if I have acragged edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are smooth, with easy cutting action. The tips are well aligned and cut from the base. There is a 2 piece nail fike with these cuticle clippers. Yes, they take awhile to ship. I think they must come from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-31-14</li>
    <li> This is a very professional nail set...love it!</li>
    <li> I just received this set the other day and I really like it! It is perfect for getting perfect nails!!! The pieces all works excellent!! I would suggest to anyone to buy this set!!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried reading some reviews about the sharpness of the trimmer but everything came perfectly. The trimmer is nice and sharp and gets the job done</li>
    <li> Perfectly normal, professional grade products! Bought a set for myself and for a friend and she loves hers too! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> shipping takes a while, but for the price it is well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Love these tools, they were shipped faster than I expected and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. They are very high quality and I cant wait to see how they will hold up !</li>
    <li> This set is great and works really well! Best price too! All the tools are sharp and clean up your nails well.</li>
    <li> These tools have some weight to them...I think they&#x27;d last anyone a lifetime. The nippers are the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever owned...they&#x27;re not only excellent for nipping hangnails, but also split nails next to your cuticles. I tried them on my fingernails as a clipper and they worked very well for that job, too. I&#x27;d recommend this set to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great set. Easy to use. Very good quality! I would highly recommend to buy. I will definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> work great.. takes awhile to ship but worth the wait. Highly recommend this product. works exactly as described in the ad.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good set for the price. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;pocket&amp;#34;, since all the items are all normal size. The &amp;#34;nail&amp;#34; trimmer is quite good for trimming cuticles, the tip is rather narrow, and sharp enough for the task. Clearly, these are NOT German tools (duh, being shipped all the way from China), but for 4 dollars it is an excellent purchase. The cuticle pushers are rather good and sharp too.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Shipping took about 2 weeks, but so worth it if you&#x27;re not in a rush.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. I am able to clean up my cuticles on my fingers and toes really easily. Great for maintaining a manicure!</li>
    <li> Good, I really liked how the cuticle clippers bounced back out, I guess that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d say, idk lol!</li>
    <li> Really good for the price it works great.  I use all the pieces and I like them. Cheap but good</li>
    <li> These are totally worth the money! The nips alone are worth it. The nips are sharp on the first snip. The other tools are just bonus. Buy multiples so you can keep a set at home, work, in the car...where ever you might need to nip those darn hangnails.</li>
    <li> The clippers broke but the other two items are well made.</li>
    <li> Great utensils,  good price &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Ummm. Ordered this over a month ago,  shipping was horrible. I completely forgot the order was pending and purchased another set. The quality is what saved this review. For price and quality, I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> SUPER GOOD QUALITY! Would suggest this to anyone without any hesitations! I do my nails by myself all the time so super super handy.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal with nice heavy pieces. The different tools are nice. I wish I had this set when I was working as a manicurist!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to all my friends. These are the best tools I have purchased so far. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality at an amazing price! I was leary to try them but they are very good quality. And work amazingly.</li>
    <li> Great tools!!! Solid metal!!! Great buy!!! They are professional grade tools. Very much worth the money!!! Arrived quickly! Better Than i expected</li>
    <li> For the price, I was suprised at the thickness and quality. I am very happy with this and will buy another when I need to replace these.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this. I brought this because it was so cheap. The pusher is to bold, nipper is not sharp, but it seemed to be good as a nail clipper. lol</li>
    <li> this product is so worth the price! for 3 dollars you get a pretty good quality product. if u cant afford to spend 30$ on a really good brand, this is the thing to buy!</li>
    <li> The 2 tools in the set are amazing I love them. They work very well pushing cuticles and prepping nails. Unfortunatley I cannot say the same about the clippers, they broke the first time I used them. The little screw just popped right out! I tried fixing but it keeps popping out. Maybe they were defected or something. I will try glue!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  One star for quality and shipping took 28 days.  Additional star for only being $3.  That&#x27;s the only good thing.  The cuticle trimmers do not even work, pull skin constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip these</li>
    <li> Only received the nippers, which are complete junk.</li>
    <li> Good product, just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Ordered a few of these sets and all were okay, but some of the nippers arrived with better cutting blade surfaces than others.  Some did not mesh properly and when closed you could see some gaps where the two half blades did not meet evenly.  Okay for the price paid, but you do get what you pay for with tools like this.</li>
    <li> the cuticle cutter was the only thing in the package.  the other 2 items were not included.</li>
    <li> I use these alllllll the time! they are great I would buy them again and recommend to any whos thinking of buying. I even bout a set for my mom cause she saw using this and she wanted a set! she loves it too! great price.</li>
    <li> I expected these tools to be cheap and junky for the price but I was very wrong! These tools are heavy duty and professional quality.  There is nothing &amp;#34;pocket size&amp;#34; about these either, they are full size tools.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a good product, especially for the money. It is well made.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Super inexpensive and better quality then I expected.</li>
    <li> These were crap! I ended up throwing them out.</li>
    <li> Although these were inexpensive, they get the job DONE!!! I mean my husband toenails are THICK&lt;br /&gt;and he broke some toenail clippers trying to cut those thangs [lol]!! I was able to use my cuticle cutter&lt;br /&gt;and they did the job perfecto!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> excellent prices and great packaging. It works well for lifting off dead skin from my cuticles. It also is great for my toenails.</li>
    <li> The cuticle cutter is nice and shart . easy to keep Clean a must have for you&#x27;re manicures and pedicure</li>
    <li> I received them today.  They are very crudely made, heavy, and have ruff edges.</li>
    <li> Once I got this in the mail it was great at first and I loved it. It came just as described and as shown but after about a week of having it all three products rusted up and I had to throw them away. Its great for a short term use product but not for the long run</li>
    <li> The cuticle cutter does NOT cut and there&#x27;s not spring to it so you have to force it open every time you try to cut, and the cuticle cleaners are way to big for the nail especially for under the nail. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Use them on my acrylic nails and they&#x27;ve held up.</li>
    <li> These are definitely salon quality. The metal is strong and the tips are as sharp as they should be in the right places. I love this set.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The cuticle pusher scrapes and scratches my nail. The cuticle nippers are cheaply built.</li>
    <li> The pusher tools are perfect; good quality workmanship &amp; no jagged edges to damage your nails. The cuticle nipper itself is a high-quality. Great deal for the price. I highly recommended the purchase.</li>
    <li> The item arrived a little late but it did arrived in well package and received a  nail clipper that said made in Germany!!! As for the rest didn&#x27;t say where they were made at, but I tired to bend them to see if the metal was cheap and the metal was good did not bend and worked well on my nails, love these!!!</li>
    <li> Took a while to get this product. But it was well worth the wait. Well worth the price. Does the job. Seem to be great utensils.</li>
    <li> Broke with second use</li>
    <li> Nice clipper set. Works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and price.. rrived so quick..</li>
    <li> I did my feet with these tools and loved it 👏</li>
    <li> Love these things. Have had them for a few years now. Really sharp and easy to use. No issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is,  no complaints here.</li>
    <li> meh... you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Implements seem made on the cheap and the cutters are dull</li>
    <li> For less than $3.... I think cuticle nippers are great. Out here in California (San Diego) they are at least $7 depending on the brand, they can go for up to $12 just the nippers alone. I found the other tools to be great for the in growing nails as well.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp tools &amp; fast shipping. Totally worth every single cent!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with item.</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced and everything works really well!</li>
    <li> Surprised at the quality of these tools.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t really screw these up. good quality.</li>
    <li> Awful nippers, but worth it for the cuticle pushing tools.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the quality since the price was so low but I am very impressed. The tools are sharp and appear to be well constructed. The different sizes can accommodate all size fingers.</li>
    <li> Nice products i like them</li>
    <li> Took a while to receive but these tools are awesome.</li>
    <li> Nippers are too dull to cut cuticle without pulling, pushers are decent. They are still a good value for back ups but I wouldn&#x27;t use them for much more.</li>
    <li> I had to wait a long time for these items to arrive, which always makes me a little nervous.  I was very pleased with the quality.  When I received the item I tried them right away.  I was super happy with the quality of the edges of cuticle pusher and clippers.  The clipper head is small making it easier to get fine cuticle skins and easier to get the curves without poking or causing injury.  I definitely recommend, just make sure you have time to wait for them as they are coming from China.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t trim cuticles not good</li>
    <li> The scissors are extremely dull and cheap. You get what you pay for - sometimes</li>
    <li> Even though it took a couple of weeks it was totally worth the wait for the quality of these tools and what I would have paid locally at the store for such a good product. They are stainless steel and work wonderfully! I use them every time I do my nails! I can&#x27;t believe I only paid a few bucks for this set!</li>
    <li> I did not care for the cuticle nipper. The other tools were great for manicures but the nipper was dull and did NOT cut away with ease. I will never purchased this item again.</li>
    <li> Cheap and thickly styled.  Can hardly use these tools and the angle on the snippers won&#x27;t clip my cuticles.  They are not precise instruments.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, just like in the nail salon. I was very disappointed on how long it took to get here.&lt;br /&gt;I was almost getting ready to just ask for a refund.</li>
    <li> For the price and the quality, these are good. The pieces are all made from metal, even the handle. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Who would expect a great piece of clipper like this. It works great on thick nails and is easy to clean. The clipper is high quality and the price is unbeatable. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The quality was far less than hoped for. 😀u get what u pay for ..</li>
    <li> I love this item, it did take a little while to get to me but that was to be expected because it did after all come from some place in China. It does the job that I need it too but be very careful, I was used to dull cutters and these are not in anyway dull. I may have gotten a few nicks in my cuticle but that&#x27;s totally my fault. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Clippers broke after 5 min</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Great Seller!!  Works great, durable, and so glad I ordered these!</li>
    <li> Even though it took too long the product was just as advertised so far so good&lt;br /&gt;Quality is good.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> Even better product. Amazing customer service. Works great and cleans easily. Used on pedicures and acrylic false nails. Would oder again and recommend</li>
    <li> The cuticle tool is dull and useless, but the other tools are great to use.</li>
    <li> My nipper broke after a few years, so I went shopping for one in stores.  I was shocked at the prices.  I went to a few different stores only to find just the nipper for anywhere between 10 to 16 dollars each in California??  For one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this pack of three set, and the nipper is strong and sturdy and sharp.  I have just bought three more.  The cuticle pusher is large and very effective.  I&#x27;m not even sure what the curved apparatus is for, but it is also well constructed and very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the storefront named \\&quot;mytopchoice\\&quot;, thanks for your product!</li>
    <li> I would recomended it to any other person.&lt;br /&gt;It was higher than my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It is made of good materials and works as it should be.</li>
    <li> they work very well and have several uses for each i like the big tool it works for using glitter and mixing acrylic powders and the other works with pushing back cuticles and removing old nail art and ofcourse the cuticle cutter for cuticles just maintain with some oil to keep from rusting or stifening</li>
    <li> I like them alot they were eorth the wait to get them</li>
    <li> They are OK but I didn&#x27;t buy them for cuticle care</li>
    <li> Got the product way before indicated to arrive (which of course is a super plus). Happy with the products, good quality</li>
    <li> Very good package, glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> At first I was really worried because it didn&#x27;t have a tracking number and because a girl said that she just kept waiting for months and it still never came it arrived in my mail box about 3 weeks before it was supposed to I loved the tools in it they work really we&#x27;ll</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! About 2 weeks before it was supposed to be here. Couldn&#x27;t be happier nice set, professional like salon. Im disinfected before use just in case. Love it! Can&#x27;t beat price good quality! Cuticle trimmers cut clean and don&#x27;t pull skin like the one I got from sallys beauty.</li>
    <li> Just what I expexcted</li>
    <li> Much better quality than I expected for the price.  I wanted the nipper, but the other tool are surprisingly more useful than I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> Product was just what I was looking for I am very happy with it. Thanks for your help, may order another one in future.</li>
    <li> This order was a very great sedition I made , I have no regrets, helps me do my nails without a salon !</li>
    <li> the cuticle nippers aren&#x27;t sharp enough. The cuticle pusher is too sharp and scrapes layers off your nail bed. Horrible!!!!!</li>
    <li> Haha that rhymed :) I thought these were great quality for the price I paid for them! The nippers aren&#x27;t the sharpest ones I ever owned, but they did the job fine.</li>
    <li> Cheap not sharp enough to cut</li>
    <li> Poor quality...waste of $</li>
    <li> I am not a professional.  Just started doing my own shellac nails 3 months ago and needed better tools for my prep.  Just got these today much earlier than expected and I am very pleased.  They are perfect for scrapping off shellac, cleaning your nails on top and underneath as well as pushing back cuticles and nipping cuticles.  Great buy!!  I will order from them again!</li>
    <li> The cuticle pushers are okay but the cuticle nipper is too blunt. For the price, whatever, since I&#x27;m only interested in the pushers. But if you are going for the nipper, forget it.</li>
    <li> I ordered these from a merchant that ships from china the items arrived before the estimated delivery date. The items exceeded my expectations they are very solid and heavy metal tools, they also claim to be made in Germany. Bottom line, they are worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Shipping takes a while but overall great</li>
    <li> I would recommend these nail tools to anyone that gets manicures and Pedicures. They work really well and seem to be made out of quality metal.</li>
    <li> It arrived missing one of the pieces... It looks like it perforated the package and fell out of it. Not sharp enough either.</li>
    <li> Was great for the price and came faster than expected!</li>
    <li> Wife likes it she is happy with it so I am happy with it</li>
    <li> love this set and does the job very nicely</li>
    <li> The cuticle pushers are acceptable, but the trimmer is too weak to cut any cuticles.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably inexpensive. High quality</li>
    <li> I love them. Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> gotta&#x27; keep the hands and feet ready for the real ladies</li>
    <li> Love the quality of the products! They are not shiny like in the picture but that is not a problem to me. Great for the price. I will be ordering again to have a set in my on-the-go manicure kit. Took a while to be delivered but that is to be expected.</li>
    <li> I reveived the product it was well pack ! It&#x27;s a great merchandise for the price I&#x27;m super please!  The shipping was fast Thanks Gina 👍</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied very good quality. and I received it sooner then they had said. thanks</li>
    <li> Not only is the set helpful when doing nails, but it also gets the job done just as if u went to the nail salon. The price was an added bonus though.</li>
    <li> the product is as what you&#x27;ll see in the picture.. and it arrived on the time frame they said.. nipper&#x27;s ok :)</li>
    <li> Excellent value, perfect condition , solid...good quality...love that I can get what I want when I want it. Delivered right to my door</li>
