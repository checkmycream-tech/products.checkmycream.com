      <li>I see a lot of complaints that it&#x27;s more of a serum consistency, well do your research</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>So glad I was able to order it through Amazon.</li>

      <li>I really love this leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>love this stuff...</li>
      <li>and I love Pureology products.</li>
      <li>In fact, it feels drier and more tangly than before I used this product.  </li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s \\&quot;mileage may vary\\&quot; since no two hair types are alike, but probably like most women, I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market at one time or another.</li>
      <li>Not quite frizzy but more like some hairs refuse to bow before me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an awesome product but buyer aware this is very old packaging.</li>
      <li>It has a more \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; scent, but I enjoy this</li>
      <li>This product is great for hair that is messed up and needs some repair it leaves your hair soft and silky</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling smooth and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Simply the best and totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair shiny and strong and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>I like the product for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Do not recommend for fine hair that has been highlighted.</li>
      <li>I became a huge Pureology fan about 10 years ago when on a trip out</li>
      <li>This is such a great product.</li>
      <li>Pureology Instant Repair surprisingly helps with most of them.  </li>
      <li>So after about fifteen to twenty minutes to allow this product to dry I apply my absolute favorite conditioner in the known universe, Shea Moisture Leave-in Conditioner!!!!</li>
      <li>Will gladly do business with this seller again - was very speedy in delivery!</li>
      <li>definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>Anyway, by using these together my color treatment lasts much longer and my hair and scalp love me in return.</li>
      <li>It really is my favorite leave in conditioner, but I can&#x27;t justify spending that much on it.  </li>
      <li>Check department store sites and do your research before you buy super expired to ducts.</li>
      <li>I even noticed that after applying it, if I don&#x27;t quickly wash my hands, the palms of my hands become sticky within 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t fight with tangles any more and my hair feels smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said all of that to say when the product dries each hair has a transparent shield around it that works exceptionally well at protecting the individual hairs.</li>
      <li>I sometimes clasp my hands together just to note how quickly the product is drying and coating the palms of my hands.</li>
      <li>Although my hair is not color treated, and rarely exposed to heated styling tools-it is still exposed to the weather elements which can hurt it and break it.</li>
      <li>The product is clear and feels more like a hair gel as opposed to a creamy leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>Realy revitilizes a tired permanent and very good for my hair.  </li>
      <li>This did not happen over night, I have to use Pureology consistently</li>
      <li>It does not take much to do the job!</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this product and used it for the first time yesterday.  </li>
      <li>sure I will buy again- only because of the steep price.</li>
      <li>However, I haven&#x27;t seen great improvement with my dry hair either using it just the same.</li>
      <li>It goes on cleanly, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance and leaves my hair softer, smoother and generally healthier looking than without.</li>
      <li>And while I love Pureology&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners, I find personally that Redken&#x27;s leave-in conditioners and curl-enhancing products work better, at half the cost.</li>
      <li>It feels light but seals in moisture at the same time.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>think the product cost too much.</li>
      <li>I color my hair and because it grows fast</li>
      <li>I hesitated to spend this much for leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>It does not leave a greasy residue, is lightweight, and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
      <li>This product has really helped prevent a lot of damage.</li>
      <li>This is not what you want to see when you pay this much for a product.</li>
      <li>I love this product ,but had to order it twice because the first one I got was left open in shipping and leaked all over the box</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love it.</li>
      <li>I have long hair and each hair is fine but there are a lot of them.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin blonde highlighted hair and it made made my hair look so good.  </li>
      <li>Normally I would not spend that much money on a leave-in product, but I received a gift card as a gift and decided to splurge.  </li>
      <li>Price was ok when the product worked - now it&#x27;s not worth one penny.</li>
      <li>I think spraying bottles for this type of leave-in products are much more efficient and less wasteful than using pumps.</li>
      <li>I have my hair colored on a regular basis and it gets lots of blow-drying, curling iron and flat iron torture, but this conditioner does wonders at helping keep it in top condition.</li>
      <li>Split ends are really non-existant &amp; it makes my hair really soft.</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair and this really helps with the frizzy&#x27;s.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used this product for years and panicked when it was discontinued. It was a little pricey but this bottle will last for years. So glad I was able to order it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> love the smell and love the way it makes my hair so shiny....had to remove one star as the $ is way out of line,,,,,not sure I will buy again- only because of the steep price. Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a 5 star rating because it has a lot to offer people with hair needs.  It&#x27;s my pick for beautiful hair because it works to repair damaged hair.  It was also advertised in a magazine as a really good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair product for some time.  I didn&#x27;t realize I could get it from Amazon so nice to know I can have it delivered to my door now.</li>
    <li> I have tried many leave in conditioners with varying levels of satisfaction. Some promise heat protection, splint end repair, color preservation, or softness-it is difficult to find a product that helps with all of them. Pureology Instant Repair surprisingly helps with most of them.  Although my hair is not color treated, and rarely exposed to heated styling tools-it is still exposed to the weather elements which can hurt it and break it. After using Pureology along side a laundry list of other products-my hair is shedding less, easier to detangle, less frizzy and shiny. This did not happen over night, I have to use Pureology consistently or my hair starts shedding again. I believe this is one of the biggest contributing products because it offers UV protection and seems to spread very evenly over hair.   The product is clear and feels more like a hair gel as opposed to a creamy leave in conditioner. It has a more \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; scent, but I enjoy this and it doesn&#x27;t stay in hair for long. I apply when my hair is wet and have no trouble spreading it through to every strand.   Hair Type: Wavy to curly, fine stranded, damaged dry ends with split ends, frizzy, greasy roots (occasionally), lightened (blonde)</li>
    <li> I really love this leave in conditioner. I use one every day. I bought this because I always use leave in conditioner and I love Pureology products. Normally I would not spend that much money on a leave-in product, but I received a gift card as a gift and decided to splurge.  It really is my favorite leave in conditioner, but I can&#x27;t justify spending that much on it.  It lasts for a really long time, too!</li>
    <li> Love it. Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use pureology shampoo and conditioner and love all their merchandise.  The leave-in conditioner is a very nice added plus.</li>
    <li> I have blond highlighted hair that I blow dry &amp; curl all the time. This product has really helped prevent a lot of damage. Split ends are really non-existant &amp; it makes my hair really soft. It&#x27;s not sticky &amp; you wont feel like there&#x27;s anything in your hair. If you&#x27;re going to blow dry, color, or use hot tools on your hair, you really need to use this product!</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in conditioner. I have my hair colored on a regular basis and it gets lots of blow-drying, curling iron and flat iron torture, but this conditioner does wonders at helping keep it in top condition. I love it and use it everyday!  Will gladly do business with this seller again - was very speedy in delivery!</li>
    <li> This product is great! i have the other essential repair spray so thought i would try this. Its liteweight and effective. you will get softened, stregnthened, UV protected hair with this product without build up. It comes with a good amount too! 8oz! Just buy it cuz it retails for around $30.</li>
    <li> love, love, love this stuff!! It is hard to find, I can only find it on Amazon.  I have natural curly hair and this really helps with the frizzy&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t seem to find another product that compares. I am a products Junky and I am hooked on this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This product works great.  Helps strengthen my hair and minimize the frizz.  I buy this all the time.  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I had psoriasis for 8 months, during which time I tried at least 15 different products, some prescription, others over the counter.  When I finally found the medication that cured my scalp, my hair was a DISASTER.  Even friends at work couldn&#x27;t help but gawk at how damaged and frayed my hair became.  I have since spent LOTS of money on various products searching for something that would bring my hair back, and nothing worked...until I tried the Pureology Instant Leave-In Conditioner.  I&#x27;m done shopping for products, because THIS CURED my hair. It shines and has body;  that damaged frizzy old-lady hair-look completely disappeared.  I used it after using the pureology essential repair shampoo and conditioner, which by themselves didn&#x27;t do much.  But topped off with the Instant Leave-In Conditioner, my hair is back!  I&#x27;m sold.  And for the record, I don&#x27;t color my hair.  Pureology&#x27;s only marketing mistake is focusing this product on color-damaged hair.</li>
    <li> This did not have the consistency that I expected a conditioner to have.  It is more like a serum with a clear, thin consistency.  The smel is good, but it did nothing to improve the texture of my hair. In fact, it feels drier and more tangly than before I used this product.  Do not recommend for fine hair that has been highlighted.</li>
    <li> I have tried several leave in conditioners over the years snd I have dry hair and this is by far the best yet.[[ASIN:B000ULJN9S Pureology Instant Repair Leave-In Hair Condition 8.5 oz (250 ml)]]I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It makes my hair feel very soft and is helping to get it back in shape. The only problem was that when it arrived, the top was stuck down and a bunch of the product had oozed out of the container. This is not what you want to see when you pay this much for a product.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to spend this much for leave in conditioner. I have long hair and each hair is fine but there are a lot of them. I dreaded combing out tangles. I used to use lots of conditioner and detangling product and still fought with tangles. I also had flyaway hair in winter. Only one pump od this product after shampooing takes care of both issues!  I don&#x27;t fight with tangles any more and my hair feels smooth and soft. It does not take much to do the job!</li>
    <li> I became a huge Pureology fan about 10 years ago when on a trip out west I&#x27;d forgotten to pack my shampoo &amp; conditioner. I used my friend&#x27;s products, which were Pureology. I haven&#x27;t looked back since (at least in their shampoo and conditioner line of products). I have extremely thick, tends-to-frizz, wavy to curly heavy hair, coarse without the right products. I don&#x27;t blow-dry my hair. I let it dry natural (or flat-iron it if I want to wear it straight), put in curl products, scrunch it with my hands and go about my business. I though I&#x27;d give this leave-in conditioner a try and was surprised that, at nearly twice the cost, it didn&#x27;t do as much for my hair as Redken&#x27;s much-cheaper leave-in conditioner did. Everyone&#x27;s \\&quot;mileage may vary\\&quot; since no two hair types are alike, but probably like most women, I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market at one time or another. And while I love Pureology&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners, I find personally that Redken&#x27;s leave-in conditioners and curl-enhancing products work better, at half the cost.</li>
    <li> love this stuff...my hair dresser uses it and I am so happy that I can have it at home between appointments.</li>
    <li> I use Just For Men, Real Black hair color treatment. I noticed that the color would begin to fade in a week. This product protects the color for weeks when used properly. It actually coats your hair with a protective substance. I even noticed that after applying it, if I don&#x27;t quickly wash my hands, the palms of my hands become sticky within 30 seconds. I sometimes clasp my hands together just to note how quickly the product is drying and coating the palms of my hands. When i wash my hands I can see the additional suds build up from removing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said all of that to say when the product dries each hair has a transparent shield around it that works exceptionally well at protecting the individual hairs. I am impressed. This coating apparently seals in stuff AND shields out toxins, pollution, and sun damage. Thus my hair retains its color three times longer than before which is what I have been looking for. Although my hair isn&#x27;t damaged, I theorize that the coating not only protects each hair but it may also act as a transparent splint that prevents ends from splitting and weak hairs from breaking off (except at the root). As a guy the worse thing I do that may damage my hair is use Just For Men hair color every few weeks. I don&#x27;t use hair dryers or perms and such. Most ladies (and some men) have a lot more to deal with than me. This product may be of some benefit to you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Fly-aways galore. Once this product dries each hair appears to be in its own universe. Not quite frizzy but more like some hairs refuse to bow before me (lol). So after about fifteen to twenty minutes to allow this product to dry I apply my absolute favorite conditioner in the known universe, Shea Moisture Leave-in Conditioner!!!! This is the best product life has to offer for my hair and scalp. I LOVE Shea Moisture Leave-in Conditioner. I put it in twice a day. It does a great job at grabbing the fly-aways and making them obey my commands. It alsomoisterizes my scalp. Oh what a product! Anyway, by using these together my color treatment lasts much longer and my hair and scalp love me in return.</li>
    <li> I love this product ,but had to order it twice because the first one I got was left open in shipping and leaked all over the box</li>
    <li> First time using Pureology Instant Repair Leave-In. It is AWESOME! I highly recommend this product!  LOVE IT! Need I say more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so saddened that I was so dissapointed with this leave-in from Pureology mainly due to its packaging. However, I haven&#x27;t seen great improvement with my dry hair either using it just the same. I wished it would have come in a spraying bottle to dispense the product more evenly through out my hair, but with a pump it&#x27;s difficult to apply it evenly on my hair and it bugs me having it all over my hands when applying it. I think spraying bottles for this type of leave-in products are much more efficient and less wasteful than using pumps.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make my hair feel greasy. Leaves my hair shiny and strong and not frizzy. Simply the best and totally worth the price. This is one hair product I can&#x27;t live without. Oh by the way I have longish highlighted hair. I never blow dry or straighten anymore.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this leave in.</li>
    <li> I have dry, brittle hair - sort of like a Brillo pad permanently attached to my head - and I&#x27;m always trying new products that can give my hair a boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying literally dozens of products, Pureology is one of the few I&#x27;d recommend unconditionally. It goes on cleanly, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance and leaves my hair softer, smoother and generally healthier looking than without. Whether I let my hair air dry or use the blow dryer, it definitely gives me better feeling and looking hair...definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and used it for the first time yesterday.  WOW!  It gave me a good hair day!  I have fine, thin blonde highlighted hair and it made made my hair look so good.  Everyone at worked even noticed that something was different about my hair and that it looked great!  I will be purchasing a bottle so I can use this prodecut everyday.  I did shampoo and condition my hair in the shower as normal and then added this to my wet hair before blow drying.</li>
    <li> WHY WAS THIS PRODUCT CANCELED? ?&lt;br /&gt;MAKES NO SENSE</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. It&#x27;s an excellent conditioner, detangles and gives my hair some slip for styling. I love the smell of it, too. It lingers in the hair for a couple days. Loreal, please do not change the formula of this product, like you&#x27;ve done with so many others!!!</li>
    <li> This product works very well with my flat iron to keep my hair protected from the heat... It feels light but seals in moisture at the same time.</li>
    <li> The product is very good. I found out that is NOT instant repair for your hair split ends. I like the product for my fine hair. It is not greasy and the shines nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product cost too much. Due to the price, I would consider other less expensive product in the market.</li>
    <li> i RATED IT 5 SO THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH.  I DON&#x27;T REVIEVE BECAUSE I DO NOT FEEL LIKE WRITING A NOVEL EVERY TIME THAT I BUY SIOMETHING.  IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, THEN i WILL EXPLAIN</li>
    <li> This product is great for hair that is messed up and needs some repair it leaves your hair soft and silky</li>
    <li> To maintain my hair color I try to only wash my hair every other day so when I do wash I use this after my shower and it helps to keep my hair soft for the two days. It does not leave a greasy residue, is lightweight, and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
    <li> I color my hair and because it grows fast I have to color it every 4 to 5 weeks. My hair is shoulder length and blonde. I use this product as directed. I can&#x27;t believe how soft and managable my hair is before and after styling. A note of caution avoid purchasing from SUPERDDEALS, because the packaging is substandard and product arrives damaged.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product but buyer aware this is very old packaging. Check department store sites and do your research before you buy super expired to ducts. The new packaging is blue round and tall.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Leaves my hair feeling smooth and healthy.  Depending upon the type/length of your hair; you only need one pump (my hair is almost at the middle of my back and somewhat fine).  Highly recommend it and when my supply ends, I will definitely be replenishing!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and frizzy hair in humid Florida.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it helps or not.  Very expensive and I don&#x27;t see any difference.  So maybe just use the regular conditioner.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. The formula has been completely changed yet they still charge the same high price. Price was ok when the product worked - now it&#x27;s not worth one penny.</li>
    <li> Works well with the shampoo and conditioner...  I use it everyday and my hair is never weighed down by to much conditioning..</li>
    <li> My husband has thick, naturally curly hair and this product allows him to have a very professional, natural, non-crispy look.</li>
    <li> Realy revitilizes a tired permanent and very good for my hair.  Like it because it is a leave in. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is such a great product!  It is something I do not want to do without now!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product, and I LOVE it. I see a lot of complaints that it&#x27;s more of a serum consistency, well do your research and you can clearly see that. I have VERY fine hair, that I highlight very often and this product makes my hair so soft and much healthier without weighing it down or making it look greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller I recieved from sucked however. They were very late. They offered me a refund to take my negative feedback off, and they never gave me one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product itself is great.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but a great product.  I use one pump and I have long hair so this lasts longer than you would expect.  I pay the price because it works so well.</li>
