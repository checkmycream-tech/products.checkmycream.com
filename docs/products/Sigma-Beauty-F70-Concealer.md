    <li> great to add cream concealers precisely to the face where needed. great to help get on product where your finger is not small enough especially. and great to conceal and sculpt around the brows and lips perfectly. durable synthetic brush bit not hard or stiff.</li>
    <li> perfect for small areas of the face. Maybe suggest the next size up, unless you know you will use this for small areas</li>
    <li> Another love it Sigma brush.</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable, and I am happy with the brush. It&#x27;s very easy to control the amount of concealer with this great brush. It cleans easily also.</li>
    <li> First purchase of a concealer brush and I am very happy with it.  Use it under my eyes and for minor imperfections.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great brush. I&#x27;ve never used a concealer brush before but got this because before I used my fingers to apply it and felt that more product stayed on my fingers than my face, and I do think this successfully helps me to use less product.</li>
    <li> Great brush I used this to clean up my wing liner, my eye brows and my concealer under my eyes</li>
    <li> amazing brush ! conceals perfect .</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  It is great for those utter areas around nose or under eyes.</li>
    <li> This brush is AWESOME!!! It helps the concealer go on easier. If you have someone that uses make-up, I recommend you pick up this little brush. They will get their monies worth for sure.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase- the brush was of the highest quality and arrived on the expected date.  The bristles are firm and slightly tapered, making it an excellent concealer brush.</li>
    <li> I love the way this brush blends concealer so easily!  Highly recommend for acne sufferers.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always find the time to write reviews, but I had to with this brush. I was ready to toss my concealer thinking it wasn&#x27;t doing a great job, drying and cakey, but then I tried this brush and wow. This brush was soft so I didn&#x27;t think it could blend a thick creamy base. It did it so well that I was able to use very little which made a huge difference in appearance. My concealer looked flawless and unnoticeable! There is no need to buy expensive brushes. I&#x27;ve been using a very expensive one that never did the job right. This is a must in anyones makeup brush collection.</li>
    <li> I love the Sigma line of brushes, they are ideal for applying make-up and are very long lasting. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I Love this concealar brush,  the quality of the product is amazing! I love Sigma products. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the bristles but feel that the size of the head is too small for applying concealer.</li>
    <li> Blends like a dream. Great for covering dark spots and under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love Sigma brushes. This one did not disappoint. Very sturdy. I received this brush (and the other one I ordered) within just a few days. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Fast and good! What else do you need?:)</li>
    <li> I have been doing research on what brushes to use and buy. I was considering buying a MAC concealer brush, however after reading some online reviews I decided to purchase this Sigma Brush and I am very glad I did. Works perfectly. Does not shed at all. Would buy Sigma brushes again.</li>
    <li> Well made, soft brush.  Arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific concealer brush. I use it every day. It is just the right weight and stiffness. Great.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush. Some of the hairs have fallen out during cleaning but no more than any other brand i&#x27;ve used. The brush is very soft while still being firm.</li>
    <li> I have used many brushes and this by far is the best concealer brush I have ever used.  I plan on future purchases and regret I didn&#x27;t buy the whole set.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good for the small areas like when u wanna hide one acne . Definitly not for the area under the eye</li>
    <li> At first I wasnt sold on it but you have to get use to using it. Now I find I use less product and its not cakey looking. I use it with my Bobi Brown corrector and concealer/powder due</li>
    <li> Its perfect to put concealer with it, I think I have pretty eye when I use it than using my hand</li>
    <li> This concealer brush is really awesome, it makes concealing blemishes really easy. Its a little too small to use for the eye area though I ended up buying the sigma large concealer brush for that purpose.</li>
    <li> This brush made the concealer flawless. I like that the brush is very soft and manageable. I love love love the brush highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This brush came quickly. It works well and is easy to clean.Glad I ordered it. That says it all as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I use it to apply concealer under my eyes and primer on my eyelids.  It blends a lot better than the makeup sponge that I used to use.</li>
    <li> very high quality brush, as is all of Sigma&#x27;s brushes. I won&#x27;t own any other brush. Received fast and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; very soft, great size, not too small not too big. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!! It&#x27;s perfect for applying concealer around your nose and mouth! The best concealer brush, I totally recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> well, i like the brush of course but we always face the shredding problem so what I did was pulling as hard as possible from the bristles and nottttthing came out. Very nice to blend underneath the eyes by the way.</li>
    <li> Really like sigma brushes.  This one is a little bit bigger than I like for applying eyeshadow otherwise it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Perfect for concealer</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with my Sigma brushes, and this is no exception.  Soft, durable, and gets the job done.  I have four Sigma brushes, all but this one given to me as a gift.  I don&#x27;t know how I got along without the F80, my shadow brush (E55), blending brush (E40) and now this one.  These are all great brushes, for a fraction of what you&#x27;d pay for MAC.  SOLD!&lt;br /&gt;This is a completely unsolicited, independent review.  I was not compensated and do not work for Sigma or any cosmetics company.</li>
    <li> I think is a good price for the good performace you can get.&lt;br /&gt;But I don´t use very frecuently, so I hope performance keeps great as so far.</li>
    <li> I love this detailer concealer brush, I use it especially to conceal under my eyebrows and in those are to get areas.</li>
    <li> I got the Bobbi Brown creamy concealer about 6 months ago and I just really didn&#x27;t way to spend a lot of money on yet another concealer brush.  I struggled with the application a lot, switching between a few different brushes and my fingers until I almost gave up.  Decided to give Sigma a try because of the awesome price point and the great things I&#x27;ve heard.  AMAZING.  Concealer goes on so smoothly and it looks perfect now!  I use it every single day, whereas before I got the brush I basically never used it out of frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use under eye concealer, this brush is a MUST HAVE!  You&#x27;re wasting your money if you apply it any other way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge Bobbi Brown brush snob, but I think that Sigma may just have converted me...</li>
    <li> After reading great reviews about Sigma brushes and seeing the Youtube gurus praising the brushes I decided to go ahead and purchase Sigma brushes for my new make-up collection (literally new, because although I&#x27;ve been using make-up all my adult life I only used basic make-up and just used the sponges the eyeshadows came with.) I now have five Sigma brushes and am looking to get a few more, because I now see how every single brush has its on purpose. This concealer brush is very useful in applying concealer to exactly where I need it. I use it with Laura Mercier&#x27;s under eye concealer to cover the green veins on my under eye area. I love this brush. Since my newfound interest in make-up I&#x27;m always checking out brushes at stores, such as Sephora and Ulta, and I have yet to find brushes other than Sigma that has piqued my interest.</li>
    <li> love, love this brush!...i would buy more of the these brushes, sigma are the way to go, very much worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love sigma! This brush is great. Smaller than a normal concealer brush, but it&#x27;s still great!</li>
