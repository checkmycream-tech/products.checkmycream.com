    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about dozen different structuring pastes - all of them were mediocre  at the best.   This product is not shiny, not sticky (after application),virtually has no scent.   I am 40 and my hair are getting thinner every year - using this product makes my hair look as they were 10 years ago.  The container is great - easy to apply on a palm.   I got it 5 starts as I can not seebwhat else can be improved.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these Brocato products!  If I mix this one with a few drops of shine gel and the &#x27;clay&#x27; product, I get a really awesome effect!</li>
    <li> Gives you the ability to style your hair all the way from a soft do to something ironclad..... love it</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have very short hair and find this product easy to use.  Not to sticky or gooey.  A little goes along way. Great for lifting and separating.</li>
    <li> Used the product for years makes me like I walk out of a salon every time! Hope you can enjoy it too!</li>
    <li> Working well.  Used to get from my hair cutter, but not anymore.  This will be a good source for continued Rock &#x27;n Roll hair!</li>
    <li> I really  love this product.  Great for all kinds of hair, I would recommend  this to anyone, especially fine hair.</li>
    <li> My sister had given what was left of her bottle after trying it. I reordered it because I liked it so much.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The shatter was pictured as a pump dispenser which is what I&#x27;m use to using but it came as a squeeze bottle instead.  Would like to have received what was pictured when I ordered.  Ordered 4.  Like the product have used it for several years but have always had it in a pump dispenser. Unhappy that I did not receive what was pictured!!!</li>
    <li> Wife loves the product.</li>
    <li> Love the product but HATE the new packaging.  Have purchased three returned one.  The pump works for about three uses, then quits pumping. I had to disassemble it and pump without the outer pumper.  I decided not to return this one, and is a pain to use.  I have another one and hate to think that it, too, will not work properly.</li>
    <li> This product bears the identical label and product number, but it does not smell or perform like authentic Shatter.  My hairdresser explained to me the concept of &#x27;divergence products&#x27;.  I believe this is a &#x27;diverged&#x27; product.  I am also a biology professor.  This product evolved, and not in a good way.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It  gives my hair body and shine.  It is used by beauticians.  That was the cause of my looking it up online.. It is easier to obtain that way.</li>
    <li> This is the second container and both have quit dispensing the cream.  You have to literally saw the top off and use like a jar.  You have to store it in a Baggie si it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  The product is good but not the packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased my second container.  The product allows me to mold and sculpt my short totally straight hair, and it stays where I put the hair unless I get caught in a strong wind.  And even after being in a strong wind, I can \\&quot;finger comb\\&quot; my hair back into place easily and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also allows me to give my hair dimension and motion.  Just don&#x27;t use too much at a time - although you can somewhat brush it away if you do use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be able to manage my hair as easily without this product - and I&#x27;ve tried many waxes.  There is only one other that I will now use, but I prefer that other product in the hot summer months.  To sum it up - I (ugh!) might have had to resort to a perm - and the blue rinse (smile) without the product.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t buy this in the store I always got it from. They&#x27;re not carrying it anymore. Hope I can continue to get it from Amazon. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with seller.The product came days before expected.Will be ordering more.</li>
