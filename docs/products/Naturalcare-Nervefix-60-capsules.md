      <li>But defiantly helps with most of his symptoms!</li>
      <li>Instaflex works SOO much better!  </li>
      <li>I used to take it much more often!</li>
      <li>Wish the bottle had more in it though!</li>
      <li>/&gt;She stopped taking the NerveFix after she started taking the prescription and found the NerveFix product had been almost as effective as the prescription drug.</li>
      <li>good product, arrived quickly</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it works fine for me!</li>
      <li>Trying one more and will see what happens.....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to find it on Amazon for cheaper.</li>
      <li>I have tingling in my toes and feet most of the time...don&#x27;t have diabetes and the Dr&#x27;s don&#x27;t have any idea</li>
      <li>To me, this just makes more sense, all the way around.</li>
      <li>I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>Sure helped me.  </li>
      <li>Can get a much better deal on-line than in health food stores.</li>
      <li>It might help some, but isn&#x27;t very effective and it sure isn&#x27;t fast working.  </li>
      <li>Worked pretty good but too pricey.</li>
      <li>Maybe I needed to take more and for a longer time, but this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
      <li>so it may be too soon to give an accurate review.  </li>
      <li>and i have confirmed nerve damage(had</li>
      <li>Discontinued for two days, and all pain disappeared, except original peripheral neuropathy in my feet.</li>
      <li>This product has a unique ingredient list that I have not seen in anything else.</li>
      <li>and I was able to sleep for the first time in 2 months since the injury.</li>
      <li>I can not say enough good things about NerveFix.</li>
      <li>I can finally sleep better and walk better.</li>
      <li>I had some issues with 3 discs in my back and have endured many epidural injections and PRP therapy to help and I must say this product alleviated a lot of the nerve aggravation while going through the processes.  </li>
      <li>Love that its a natural product!</li>
      <li>everything is fine thanks a lot</li>
      <li>When I very first took NerveFix, it worked right away.</li>
      <li>She now takes both and rarely has a problem with neuropathic pain in her feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans being as variable as we are, the product likely will not be effective or everyone.</li>
      <li>We use this to take the nerve pain away and its more natural than what the doc prescribes which can be detrimental to one&#x27;s health.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off just buying a good B complex and</li>
      <li>i have nerve problems in my right hand from surgery.  </li>
      <li>Then I took NerveFix and right away</li>
      <li>It really works and the price is not bad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with my pain too long and am thrilled about this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rarely do I find a product that I come back to more than once or twice, and rarely do I ever write a review, but this product is one I don&#x27;t want to be without.</li>
      <li>Took two capsules in AM and two in EVE as directed first day.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>fyi&lt;br /&gt;i had read reviews on another web site, for exact item before buying.</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle&#x27;s worth and there was no change/</li>
      <li>More like it is several things are working</li>
      <li>After the first dose, the tingling in my hands, feet and head were gone.</li>
      <li>This stuff really helps neuropathy!</li>
      <li>Really helps with the burning numbness!</li>
      <li>there are no words for this stuff...when i first get pain which i have every day almost..</li>
      <li>Great fix for sharp pain caused by  Morton&#x27;s Neuroma in my left foot.</li>
      <li>I bought this after the strong anti-inflammatories the neurosurgeon gave me did nothing for the pain or healing, only caused constipation.</li>
      <li>Very highly recommended...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to rate this product according to your scale, because I don&#x27;t feel that enough time has passed for me to give an accurate review.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even have to take in much anymore.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would help with the pins and needles in my arm from the pinched nerves in my neck.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really help with symptoms of numbness, tingling, burning, nerve pain and pins and needles.  </li>
      <li>paid too much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really helped her with, as described by her, the &#x27;nervy, jumpy&#x27; feeling in her legs etc.</li>
      <li>Husband continues to take this along with prescriptions and is finally pain free.  </li>
      <li>your money; go to a doctor and get real medication.</li>
      <li>Overall not a bad product and does provide some relief.</li>
      <li>I take two capsules a day, and it did take about a month or so for them to fully integrate into my system, but now my pain is less and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Alpha Lipoic (main ingredients of the product ) and save yourself  $$$.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since last October 2013 when I got the Shingles and continue today to make sure they are gone and don&#x27;t come back any time soon. .</li>
      <li>my goodness I find these pills easy to swallow not large at all</li>
      <li>I had high hopes but nada.&lt;br /&gt;PBT.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from pain from a nerve/muscle injury.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend NerveFix to anyone with Fibro or who has unspecified nerve pain.</li>
      <li>I can clean for a long time now.</li>
      <li>These are also far less (cost wise) than the Lyrica are as well, so I can order several bottles at a time without having to go see my doctor every month.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use the product for a few more weeks to futher evaluate if the condition improves.  </li>
      <li>Tried it again, second day, continuing pain in calves and additional pain in right leg hamstring muscle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everyone is different, and I can understand why it doesn&#x27;t work for some people, but when it does work, it&#x27;s really a God sent!</li>
      <li>i posted exact same info that i typed here on amazon with one star....</li>
      <li>If I have really overdone it and can barely move, I take 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so, its clear they are only allowing positive reviews of the products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper and works just as well if not better than the original product.</li>
      <li>I realize everyone is different, but time after time it has really helped.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this really helps, I have inched nerves in my neck and see a chiropractor regularly.</li>
      <li>I took Lyrica for a couple years, but it was really tedious because my doctor couldn&#x27;t prescribe more than a month&#x27;s worth at a time, which meant I had to see him 12 times a year just to keep from hurting.</li>
      <li>have subsided to a large extent but are still present to a lesser extent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used NerveFix for several years and really believe it helps with nerve pain caused by pinched nerves in the lower back (sciatica).</li>
      <li>My feet still tingle but its so minimum that I barely even realize it.</li>
      <li>Apparently there is an ingredient in it that will elevate your heart rate and blood pressure.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product would buy from again</li>
    <li> after a bout with sciatica wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good but too pricey. You&#x27;re better off just buying a good B complex and Alpha Lipoic (main ingredients of the product ) and save yourself  $$$. It&#x27;s much cheaper and works just as well if not better than the original product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really help with symptoms of numbness, tingling, burning, nerve pain and pins and needles.  What I did feel after a few days was the feeling of being drugged.  Couldn&#x27;t even sit down for a few seconds without starting to fall asleep.  Always tired.  After closer examination of ingredients, was found to have numerous relaxant herbs in it.  Was a great sleep aid if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.  slept well at night while taking it.</li>
    <li> I had just bought this and had only taken it for six days(i didnt feel it working at all, so made an appt with dr again)....I had surgery several weeks ago and i have confirmed nerve damage(had emg done). I took this to the pain managment dr...and he told me discontinue immediately. Apparently there is an ingredient in it that will elevate your heart rate and blood pressure. $20 wasted....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated: fyi&lt;br /&gt;i had read reviews on another web site, for exact item before buying. it was 20+ reviews.....all of them, good to great ratings(4-5 stars)...i posted exact same info that i typed here on amazon with one star....i waited a week and my review was never posted on that other web site.....so, its clear they are only allowing positive reviews of the products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product going on the reviews and shouldn&#x27;t have this product hasn&#x27;t worked at all for me paid too much</li>
    <li> I have neuropathy in my feet and sometimes my feet and legs feel all creepily Crawly so when I take some of these it all goes away. I&#x27;m not a Dr. But I know thus works for me.</li>
    <li> I have fibromyalgia, herniated disc, swollen discs, bursitus, sciatica -- you name it. I am a label-reader.  I read everything before it goes in my cart. This product has a unique ingredient list that I have not seen in anything else. Don&#x27;t think there is any one ingredient that is making it work. More like it is several things are working together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NerveFix is the only thing that relieves the hyper-sensitivity and alleviates the pain to a manageable level. It doesn&#x27;t make it all go away for me, just keeps me from losing my mind.  I take two in the morning every day.  If I have really overdone it and can barely move, I take 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say its a pain killer per se, and it&#x27;s not a muscle relaxer - so it doesn&#x27;t make you woozy or wired like some prescription stuff does. No stomach upset, with or without food. I don&#x27;t experience any interactions with anything else I usually take, such as Vit C, biotin, vinpocetine, collagen, sea buckthorn, and saffron. I don&#x27;t experience side effects of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rarely do I find a product that I come back to more than once or twice, and rarely do I ever write a review, but this product is one I don&#x27;t want to be without.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing, so fa, that relieves the pain in my feet.</li>
    <li> Has not worked for me or my wife. Still, it may work for you.</li>
    <li> I have bad neuropathy due to my sugar and a back injury where my spine got pushed up into my neck and I have bulging discs, arthritis, and pinched nerves both in my neck and lower back, along with bursitis, broken tailbone, vertebrae and hip. The dr said I was losing the feeling in my head and feet. I couldnt sleep or walk. I was in constant pain and tingling especially at night. My head, nose and cheeks were constantly tingling. I looked up items for nerve problems and found Nerve Fix. After the first dose, the tingling in my hands, feet and head were gone. My feet still tingle but its so minimum that I barely even realize it. This Nerve Fix has been such a blessing. I can finally sleep better and walk better. So grateful this was made.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would help with the pins and needles in my arm from the pinched nerves in my neck.  I took 2 morning and night for 2 weeks and no change.  Maybe I needed to take more and for a longer time, but this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
    <li> Did not help with the problem that I thought it would. I guess I would visit the Doctor.&lt;br /&gt;There must something else going on.</li>
    <li> Caused scatic nerve to be even more painful.  Like cures like except in my case the &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; further exacerbated the pain.  I had high hopes but nada.&lt;br /&gt;PBT.</li>
    <li> Bought for partner who has neuropathy from chemo treatments but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help. Maybe it works for different nerve pain but would not recommend for severe neuropathy.</li>
    <li> Nervefix was recommended by a friend whose mother experienced pain and neuropathy.  I was given a supply of this product in conjunction with Alpha Lipoic Acid.  When taken together, the pain and bubble-like feeling in my feet were reduced.  I ordered this product based on the improvement in my condition.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps neuropathy! Love that its a natural product!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It was cheaper to order this way</li>
    <li> It did help some for my pain from pinched nerves---and it did help make me sleep better--------but after taking it a few days it gave me a &amp;#34;drugged&amp;#34; feeling! Plus I&#x27;m not happy with the fact that the ingredient belladonna in it is considered a  poison!</li>
    <li> Recommend this homeopathic item it to anyone with nerve damage to try it.  Sure helped me.  Can get a much better deal on-line than in health food stores.</li>
    <li> I take two capsules a day, and it did take about a month or so for them to fully integrate into my system, but now my pain is less and more manageable.  It&#x27;s not completely gone, but I&#x27;m not waking up out of a deep sleep because the nerves in my feet are attacking me.</li>
    <li> I switched to this brand to see if I could save a little money. I was not impressed. At least for me, my neuropathy flared up again after using for a week. I switched back to my old brand and have gotten some relief again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to rate this product according to your scale, because I don&#x27;t feel that enough time has passed for me to give an accurate review.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, does wonders to address my nerve pain.</li>
    <li> Took it for a month and nothing made me constipated….I hope it works for somebody else, I say our pain is all in our mind.</li>
    <li> my goodness I find these pills easy to swallow not large at all however they are not the cure all i was hoping for they do diminish my irritating leg tingling for a few hours after i take it but then the tingling returns to some degree but at least i find relief for a few hours when these symptoms show up and it is enough relief for nighttime as i have been taking them twice daily. Overall not a bad product and does provide some relief.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used NerveFix for several years and really believe it helps with nerve pain caused by pinched nerves in the lower back (sciatica).</li>
    <li> Have only used this product a couple of weeks so it may be too soon to give an accurate review.  I was having a lot of problems with diabetic neuropathy in my feet and the symptoms (numbness, feelings of pins and needles, burning sensations) have subsided to a large extent but are still present to a lesser extent.  I will continue to use the product for a few more weeks to futher evaluate if the condition improves.  If the condition continues to improve, I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> received the package everything is fine thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I had terrible nerve pain on my law, neck and shoulder, sometimes my feet. I went to a specialist and he said nothing at all is wrong with me and must be stress. I do have stress in my life and am trying to control that. When I very first took NerveFix, it worked right away. I&#x27;ve suffered with my pain too long and am thrilled about this product. I don&#x27;t even have to take in much anymore. Lately one bottle last me six months! I used to take it much more often! I&#x27;m glad to find it on Amazon for cheaper. I&#x27;m going on a big trip to Budapest and will take some with me in case I need it. I don&#x27;t want to take it in a big bottle and will put a few in a small baggie. I just hope I can get it through the boarder! lol!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, and I can understand why it doesn&#x27;t work for some people, but when it does work, it&#x27;s really a God sent!</li>
    <li> I am an insulin dependent diabetic, and have been for 39 years. About 6 years ago, I started having problems because of nerve damage. I sit in an office at a computer all day, and after a couple of hours sitting there with my arms of the edge of the desk, they would ache and bother me badly. I went to my endocrinologist, who suggested I be put on Lyrica. I took Lyrica for a couple years, but it was really tedious because my doctor couldn&#x27;t prescribe more than a month&#x27;s worth at a time, which meant I had to see him 12 times a year just to keep from hurting. I happened to run across this while looking for something else on Amazon, and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I am glad I did. I have been using these for the past 3 months, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have been off of the Lyrica now for about 2 1/2 months, and honestly, do not need them. These are also far less (cost wise) than the Lyrica are as well, so I can order several bottles at a time without having to go see my doctor every month. To me, this just makes more sense, all the way around. Very highly recommended...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a total rip off.</li>
    <li> My husband has used NerveFix for about 6 weeks and notices a very slight improvement of diabetic neuropathy in his feet.&lt;br /&gt;He is also exercising his toes, so it is hard to tell if the improvement can be ascribed to NerveFix.</li>
    <li> Really helps with the burning numbness!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money......I tried this product for 10 days; I have nerve issues on my left side ranging from my foot to my face. I thought this product would work for me, but it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money; go to a doctor and get real medication.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Appears to be a placebo to me. Doesn&#x27;t work for my nerve pain at all. I&#x27;ve used sunburn lotion with lidocaine and also 1 with benzocain in a spray. Both OTC. They both give temporary relief. The benzocain starts faster, but the lidocaine ointment lasts longer.</li>
    <li> One bottle and nothing.  Trying one more and will see what happens.....</li>
    <li> When I use it as directed, over several weeks, it has been helping reduce my nerve pain in feet and hands</li>
    <li> I can not say enough good things about NerveFix. I was getting more and more depressed every year because my feet burned and had horrible pain in them. I do have diabetes and thought this would be my life, worse every year. Then I took NerveFix and right away the pain went away and my feet no longer burned. I can now sleep, wear shoes and socks. Added bonus my hip pain went away. I can clean for a long time now. Usually I could only stand for a short period of time but all that changed. You can not believe how happy I am now. I wish it could work for every one the way it did for me. I noticed relief in 2 days. Been taking it for 3 weeks today. I never really believed it would work but thought I&#x27;d give it a try, boy am I glad I was wrong.</li>
    <li> I completed the entire bottle with NO noticeable improvements.  Everyone is different so this may work for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this really helps, I have inched nerves in my neck and see a chiropractor regularly. I wanted something that would help me see him less frequently but this is not it.</li>
    <li> Reorder all the time. Great product that seems to help.</li>
    <li> I do not feel any difference. I still have numbness in feet/hands and pain</li>
    <li> there are no words for this stuff...when i first get pain which i have every day almost..i take a pill and in 30 min the sting goes away..excellent</li>
    <li> i have nerve problems in my right hand from surgery.  NerveFix didn&#x27;t help at all; in fact the symptoms--pins and needles, tingling, numbness feelings in hand were worse and yesi followed directions</li>
    <li> This is a great product, now i can get it at a great price through Amazon!</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE side effects. I read on a review here that someone used this for there bad back. So I tried it. It was great the 1st day. Took it for 2 wks . Got severe headaches, every nerve in my body seemed like it was FRIED. Have yet to recover &amp; I stopped taking it  about 2 wks ago. The pharmacist said it was for diabetic pain, so maybe it helps those with that problem. If your looking to find pain relief for your back or other problems,  I recommend you DO NOT TAKE THIS !!</li>
    <li> Helps with Neuropathy</li>
    <li> My husband has MS and this works so great for him! Wish the bottle had more in it though! But defiantly helps with most of his symptoms!</li>
    <li> Garbage.  My left hand is numb and tingly constantly.  I used the whole bottle&#x27;s worth and there was no change/no improvement whatsoever.  What a waste of money - the product is just hype.</li>
    <li> Great fix for sharp pain caused by  Morton&#x27;s Neuroma in my left foot.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since last October 2013 when I got the Shingles and continue today to make sure they are gone and don&#x27;t come back any time soon. .</li>
    <li> I had some issues with 3 discs in my back and have endured many epidural injections and PRP therapy to help and I must say this product alleviated a lot of the nerve aggravation while going through the processes.  It really helped with the pin and needles and random tingling feelings. I would recommend this product at least as an alternative to those dangerous prescription meds. It does work!</li>
    <li> product works well, repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Nerve Fix was indeed a God send for my Mother whose chemo left her with SEVERE neuropathy in her feet and nerve problems in her arms and  hands. She was practically bed ridden, unable to wear any socks or shoes, get to the bathroom.  Pain management was a joke.  Drs prescriptions did not help and caused other side effects just as bad.  Additionally, I am a fan of &amp;#34;Your Health with  Dr Richard and Cindy Becker, channel 376 on direct tv and on one of his programs he said alpha lipoic acid is necessary to get substantial relief from neuropathy.  So, I  give her two nerve fix, two alpha lipoic acid (600 mg) in the am, and two nerve fix, 2 alpha lipoic acid at night and look out, up and out we go.  I cant get her our of wal mart or the mall!!!!  Those items work together and her relief happens when they are taken TOGETHER.  I&#x27;ve told others and they have gotten the same speedy relief.  The relief is quick and swift, usually the same day or within a couple of days.  If for some reason her pain increases, she will take that same dosage 3 times a day instead of two times a day.  Get ready for a miracle!!!!!!!.  L.B. Madison</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work at all for me</li>
    <li> good product, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I bought this after the strong anti-inflammatories the neurosurgeon gave me did nothing for the pain or healing, only caused constipation. I recieved these late in the afternoon around 4pm, took 8 capsules because the pain in my arm was excruciating and by 9pm, the pain was 80% gone and I was able to sleep for the first time in 2 months since the injury. I take 3 capsules 3 times a day and my nerves are relaxed and I am progressing faster now with my physical therapy stretches and nerve gliding. I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from pain from a nerve/muscle injury.</li>
    <li> Third, maybe even fourth bottle my mom has used. It&#x27;s really helped her with, as described by her, the &#x27;nervy, jumpy&#x27; feeling in her legs etc.</li>
    <li> I like it and it seems to work but only in conjunction with my nerve medication,</li>
    <li> Seems to help at times.</li>
    <li> We use this to take the nerve pain away and its more natural than what the doc prescribes which can be detrimental to one&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be without these again...ever if possible. They work and Amazon has the best price...thanks!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who had post herpetic shingle pain.  No prescription meds were working.  He tried this and obtained some minimal relief.  Doctor changed up his prescriptions, which seemed to help.  Husband continues to take this along with prescriptions and is finally pain free.  Can&#x27;t say this &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; him, but will say it didn&#x27;t hurt the process.</li>
    <li> I buy these capsules for my sister who suffers from nerve pain in her feet caused by diabetic neuropathy. She began taking these a couple of years ago before she had access to a prescription drug designed to alleviate the problem. She found them to be a great relief, although they didn&#x27;t eliminate the pain entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She stopped taking the NerveFix after she started taking the prescription and found the NerveFix product had been almost as effective as the prescription drug. She now takes both and rarely has a problem with neuropathic pain in her feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans being as variable as we are, the product likely will not be effective or everyone. But if you have neuropathic nerve pain and don&#x27;t have access or don&#x27;t want to take the prescription drugs, you should consider giving this homeopathic herbal remedy a try.</li>
    <li> Bought this product upon advice from a trusted and knowledgeable friend.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s homeopathic, does not harm, and, I believe, does help.&lt;br /&gt;Better than taking potentially damaging pharmaceuticals.</li>
    <li> excellent product for hands. relieves pain at night so I can sleep. i used all the time when nerve pain from over work acts up</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it works fine for me!</li>
    <li> I tried Nervefix as an alternative to Lyrica and Cymbalta. (Which I was prescribed for nerve pain in the jaw and neck) Both of the prescription drugs left me feeling out of sorts and cloudy feeling. I have no side effects from the nervefix it is working great and an added bonus, no restless leg syndrome!!!</li>
    <li> Tried this from a recommendation read elsewhere. Took two capsules in AM and two in EVE as directed first day. Woke up next morning with pain in my calves, never had before. Tried it again, second day, continuing pain in calves and additional pain in right leg hamstring muscle. Discontinued for two days, and all pain disappeared, except original peripheral neuropathy in my feet. Returning for refund.</li>
    <li> It might help some, but isn&#x27;t very effective and it sure isn&#x27;t fast working.  It might help if you use it over a long period of time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to help my ulnar nerve symptoms.</li>
    <li> No difference.. placebo affect.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  Whenever my sciatic nerve flairs up this is the only product that I&#x27;ve found to help.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for my husband.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well for me. I realize everyone is different, but time after time it has really helped.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! It stopped me from having neck surgery.</li>
    <li> Instaflex works SOO much better!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well for nighttime nerve firing from herniated discs that were poorly and belatedly repaired.  Not foolproof, but often restores the ability to sleep when it would otherwise be difficult or impossible.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried other supplements like this that are a little less expensive but we had to go back to these. They work the best for relieving nerve pain on an ongoing basis.</li>
    <li> I have tingling in my toes and feet most of the time...don&#x27;t have diabetes and the Dr&#x27;s don&#x27;t have any idea why.  On occasion, I also get electrical \\&quot;shock\\&quot; type impulses that run down both sides of my face, down my arms, and into my fingers.  When I take two of these daily I don&#x27;t have either problem, when I stop...they come back.  I don&#x27;t have any idea why this helps I just know it does, and I&#x27;m never without them.  I also have Fibro Myalgia and these seem to help immensely with the Fibro attacks.  I highly recommend NerveFix to anyone with Fibro or who has unspecified nerve pain.</li>
    <li> A very good product to have at home. It really works and the price is not bad.</li>
    <li> I buy these items for a friend living in a nursing facility.  She swears by them.  Her fingers tingle and she loses feeling in her toes without them.  I do not know how they work but she is not able to use her hads without them.  If you are experiencing problems with touch you might try this item.  She swears by it.</li>
