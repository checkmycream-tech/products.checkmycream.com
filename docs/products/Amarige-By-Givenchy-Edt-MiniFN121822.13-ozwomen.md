    <li> One of my favorite all time fragrances.  I like to keep am mini of all my favorites on display on my dresser.  This fragrance is different from any other fragrance I know of and I love it.  It almost smells like a mild bit of cedar--I had a cedar closet growing up and it reminds of that wonderful time :-0</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t worn this perfume in a while, but it still smells great, and you don&#x27;t need much. It lasts all day, and you can still smell it the next and longer on your clothes. The seller also provided perfect packaging, there was no spillage.</li>
    <li> smells great for my girfriend</li>
    <li> I was looking for the fragrance of the mimosa blossom.  Even though it was advertised as this, it wasn&#x27;t at all the same aroma.  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but I didn&#x27;t find the fragrance pleasing at all.</li>

    <li> Very disappointed, it is marked on the box that it is a sample and not for sale, yet I paid 10.00 for each bottle. The scent is so weak I find it hard to believe it&#x27;s actually any brand of perfume.</li>
    <li> I swear to god this is a knock off bottle.. just does not have the lasting power of the perfume I would buy in Macy&#x27;s etc.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my favorite smelling fragrances to this date. For anyone ready to make a splash on the town.This is the one that grabs all noses around!
