      <li>I was able to shave my balls with ease.</li>
      <li>I had ordered three and am glad I did.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how it would get any better than this</li>
      <li>We love the clippers that we have</li>
      <li>I then proceeded to shave my pub3s and 4rmp1t hair to satisfying results.      </li>
      <li>This is a great product and saves me so much money clipping him myself instead of taking him to the groomers.  </li>
      <li>I was able to just &amp;#34;plug and play&amp;#34; onto my existing Wahl clippers.</li>
      <li>Think this is the third time to buy these for myself and have been very happy every time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been pretty good about cleaning the hair off the blades after each cut and cleaning with Clippercide spray and/or oiling with Wahl clipper oil.  </li>
      <li>but I was happy that I didn&#x27;t need to buy a new kit altogether.  </li>
      <li>Overall, very good.</li>
      <li>I ordered and installed these blades and found them to be much more sturdy and robust than the original gear.  </li>
      <li>First haircut with new blades was extremely pleasant!  </li>
      <li>set is easy to install</li>
      <li>The blade set was easy to order and received it on time.</li>
      <li>easy installation.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have to pay much for this product and I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Very sharp and works 100% perfectly,</li>
      <li>Product appears fine.  </li>
      <li>and they work fine now.  </li>
      <li>Fit Wahl hair clippers, replacing worn out blades.</li>
      <li>First off they came a day early were exactly as described and fit my clippers perfect.</li>
      <li>He was so happy because was the same thing as shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>Fantastically smooth, even cut, no hair pulls.</li>
      <li>I was happy when I discovered that amazon carried the item at the same price it would have cost me to go find it in the brick-and-mortar stores.  </li>
      <li>I guess that Wahl is a great brand to use because they retain their function even after several years.</li>
      <li>They fit my Wahl clippers.  </li>
      <li>I had a set of Wahl clippers from Walmart and these fit the clippers.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fit well and had to be modified to do so.</li>
      <li>We werent sure if this was the exact ones</li>
      <li>, there are no screws included with this kit, so you&#x27;ll need the original screws.</li>
      <li>Original Wahl OEM part.</li>
      <li>After the first cut I noticed a huge difference and gave a smooth cut which was easy to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These replacement blades arrived quickly and were super easy to install.</li>
      <li>Last ones were good for about 8 years.</li>
      <li>My clippers have the adjustable taper lever, and I think it&#x27;s just a fact of having the adjustability, it allows for tiny movement and flexibility of the dynamic blade, and therefore will never line up perfectly along the full edge.  </li>
      <li>This was an exact fit for a replacement.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately not everything is made to be fixable anymore, fortunately these are.  </li>
      <li>This blade set had given them new life and they now cut smoothly and easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have sharp blades again for a clean easy cut.  </li>
      <li>and so many new models have come out.  </li>
      <li>I was also amazed by how much better the clippers cut with these new, sharper blades.  </li>
      <li>Easy and fast to replace.</li>
      <li>They fit good and are very sharp.</li>
      <li>They are  easy to install, very nice and sharp, I replace them every year, it saves our family lot of money instead of buying new clippers or going to haircut places.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.  </li>
      <li>However, if you have a large dog with medium to long hair, you&#x27;re better off taking him to a pet groomer or buy a better blade.  </li>
      <li>Took me a a couple minutes of trying because the blade moves when you tighten the screw but got it right</li>
      <li>but I shouldn&#x27;t have to debur or hone them right out of the package.</li>
      <li>Zipped right through.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These replacement blades work great.  I have four small dogs that I shave during the hot, humid summer months.  These blades last me about two years.</li>
    <li> Last ones were good for about 8 years. I expect the same from these. Good Product. Think I&#x27;ll go cordless next time.</li>
    <li> I dropped my clippers and took a chunk out of the big blade and got this to replace it. I switched up the blades and WOW! I didn&#x27;t realize how dull they&#x27;d become after 6 years of use. If the base of the unit still works fine, just replace the blade! Save some money!!</li>
    <li> These replacements are dull. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Just buy a new set clippers. It&#x27;s not easy being bald.</li>
    <li> This replacement blade set fit perfectly on my very old Wahl clippers. Saved me from buying a new unit and kept more waste out of the landfill.</li>
    <li> We have four sons (plus the dad!), so there are a lot of haircuts at our house.  Our Wahl trimmer has always been a blessing, but it became more and more painful at haircut time as it slid through the boys&#x27; hair.  We found this replacement blade set on Amazon. Problem solved! The razor is once again gliding through hair.  I threw my last Wahl away, not knowing that the blades could be replaced.  This was the perfect answer to our problem. :)</li>
    <li> I have a Wahl Taper 2000 and the blades were becoming dull, making it harder to get a clean cut. These replacement blades arrived quickly and were super easy to install. I purchased these along with the Wahl oil to make sure they stay well lubricated. After the first cut I noticed a huge difference and gave a smooth cut which was easy to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product rather than buying brand new clippers!</li>
    <li> Worked well on my dog clipper. Great value.</li>
    <li> Service was very prompt.  Ordered on a Saturday night and was on my doorstep Wednesday.  First haircut with new blades was extremely pleasant!  Zipped right through.  And to think I did not have to go through store to store looking for the item.  Good Job!</li>
    <li> Very sharp.  perfect fit.  ordering new ones on line is cheaper than taking clippers to a local sharping shop.  Ha ha the world we live in.</li>
    <li> The blades came when they said they would and looked just like they were supposed to.  Haven&#x27;t replaced them yet so don&#x27;t know how sharp they are or if they will make a difference.  Rated it a 5 but could change upon use.</li>
    <li> WOW!!!  These new blades cut like BUTTER!  I can&#x27;t believe that I waited 10 years before changing out my blades to a brand new set!  What a difference!  I&#x27;ve always been pretty good about cleaning the hair off the blades after each cut and cleaning with Clippercide spray and/or oiling with Wahl clipper oil.  After ~10 years of home use with no sharpening, and since I had to disassemble for a cord replacement anyway, I decided it was time for new blades.  They were a perfect fit for my Wahl Chrome Pro home clippers and I&#x27;m very pleased.  No more razor burn when I put the teeth as close as they&#x27;ll go, and no more individual hairs being pulled periodically during the cutting process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can come up with isn&#x27;t even the fault of the blades... I just wish that it were easier to get the blades lined up and tightened down on the clippers so that there is exactly the same length of teeth showing along the full edge.  My clippers have the adjustable taper lever, and I think it&#x27;s just a fact of having the adjustability, it allows for tiny movement and flexibility of the dynamic blade, and therefore will never line up perfectly along the full edge.  Not the fault of the blades, but just a minor gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fesco Distributors got these things out QUICK (no more than 2 days and they were in my mail) and had the best price around!  Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have sharp blades again for a clean easy cut.  I have really thick hair that dulls blades in a year or so.</li>
    <li> I have an Eskimo Spitz and live in the south - poor dog!  He was a rescue.  Anyway, the blades are good.  The only negative is one set last one clipping on him, but he looks great when I am done.  I just wish I could get two clippings before the blade goes dull.  So I make sure to buy enough blades to cover the summer clippings.  This is a great product and saves me so much money clipping him myself instead of taking him to the groomers.  He just simply gets a close shave every few months in the summer to cool him down as he basks in the AC of the indoors.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement blade because I decided to drop my hair clippers into my sink and break some teeth of a blade.  Excellent quality and is much less expensive than purchasing a new set of hair clippers.</li>
    <li> In the years since I first bought my clippers I had obviously forgotten how well they can cut. This blade set had given them new life and they now cut smoothly and easily. I will replace these more often in the future.</li>
    <li> All as advertised. Don&#x27;t know how it would get any better than this</li>
    <li> The clipper blades arrived quickly and have been a great asset in filling my home-haircut needs!  So nice to have sharp clipper blades again, at a reasonable cost!</li>
    <li> I have a set of Wahl Pet Clippers, Model PCMC-2, that I use on our small poodle.  These blades fit perfectly and cut great.</li>
    <li> These are great clipping blades for keeping dogs well-groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought I would be able to sharpen these blades myself with a recognized flat, glass-plate disk sharpener, and although it takes an act of Congress to get Wahl to part with why I cannot achieve more than about two or three such sharpenings before the blades won&#x27;t cut anymore, at all, suffice it to say that there really IS a special way THEY have of sharpening the blades back to pristine condition - well worth the small cost they charge to achieve this end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these blades with the confidence that they will work well until they need sharpening - but, only done by Wahl!</li>
    <li> I dropped my clippers and chipped the corner of the blade.  I needed a replacement.  I ordered these, they arrived, and I installed them and used them the same day.  Comes with lubricating oil so it was basically plug and play.    They are sharp and steady.  I used it on my head (with guard) and later used it to shave my beard (no guard).  Fantastically smooth, even cut, no hair pulls.</li>
    <li> My husbands clippers was well worn and over 7 years old. Got the nice replacement blade and it works perfectly and cuts his hair so much nicer.</li>
    <li> Great product/Good Seller will buy again from seller. Product came fast and as expected. Nice!</li>
    <li> The blades work really well. The last pair we had on our clippers lasted about 3 years but we probably should have changed them after about 2 years. They stay sharp longer if you use the oil on them occasionally and keep them clean when you put them away.</li>
    <li> I have the Wahl color pro kit and purchase this blade set every year. My wife has been cutting my hair for about 8 years now and Wahl shavers are built great. For about 10 bucks a year replacing this blade, I&#x27;ve saved about $20 every 3-4 weeks I would have spent going for a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is a little tricky to align at first. If you place the cutting blade too forward, it will come above the guide and can nick you. If you set it too far back, you can&#x27;t get a close cut (only important when you&#x27;re trimming etc.). Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s not too bad. The blade should be about 1/16&amp;#34;&amp;#34; back from the guide.</li>
    <li> I bought this blades because one of mine broke in half. This blades fits perfectly on any WHAL groomer machine. It really works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Been using wahl clipper and these exact blades for yrs.  these did not work ..... Blades were dull right out of the box.  The company denied selling used blades and said they&#x27;d ship me new ones but I had to pay to ship the dull ones back first.  Replacement blades weren&#x27;t the sharpest either.  Threw the clippers and blades away and bought diff brand.</li>
    <li> Product appears fine.  I haven&#x27;t needed to use it yet to verify sharpness.  Shipping to AK. was OUTRAGEOUS!!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t fit well and had to be modified to do so.</li>
    <li> Works Great!! Just What I Needed, Great Doing Business With....</li>
    <li> I buy these blades for my Wahl hair cut machine. They are  easy to install, very nice and sharp, I replace them every year, it saves our family lot of money instead of buying new clippers or going to haircut places.</li>
    <li> If you have a small dog with very short hair, these might be ok. However, if you have a large dog with medium to long hair, you&#x27;re better off taking him to a pet groomer or buy a better blade.  I bought these to replace the original wahl blade that came with my dog clippers, however, they are not as sharp as one would hope to shave your pet.  Spending the extra money for a better set is worth it.</li>
    <li> Keep garbage out of landfills and give new life to your old clippers.&lt;br /&gt;This set is easy to install and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying new hair clippers.</li>
    <li> We have an old clipper set and when my husband dropped it accidentally, the one corner of the blade broke off.  I didn&#x27;t think that I would find a replacement because ours was older and so many new models have come out.  However, I found it.  It&#x27;s just a blade set but I was happy that I didn&#x27;t need to buy a new kit altogether.  We love the clippers that we have so we didn&#x27;t want to replace it.  One thing to say though, be careful when changing it because it is sharp.  What&#x27;s amazing is that even after years of use, our old blade is still very sharp.  I guess that Wahl is a great brand to use because they retain their function even after several years.</li>
    <li> I ordered these and the were not very sharp.Being a barber I was not happy,they did last a little while,no problem.</li>
    <li> I dropped mine and broke a couple of teeth. This replacement set is easy to install and works great with no issues</li>
    <li> The new 1 seems to be identical to the replacement therefore how could it get any worse?</li>
    <li> I have 2 Wahl MC2 hair clippers that were being used while they were dull for some time now.So, i decided to purchase some replacement blades because i was tired of my hair being ripped off instead of sliced off.  I first tried them on the newer mc2, but there was no difference.About to punch a hole through someone&#x27;s head, i tried them on the older mc2 and they actually worked, so i shaved my 17 pound dog for my first test.I then proceeded to shave my pub3s and 4rmp1t hair to satisfying results.      I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t work on the newer clippers since my old clippers are about 7 or 8 years old, maybe they recently started using recycled toilet paper to make their newer steel clipper or maybe they outsourced their manufacturing to China&#x27;s chinatown slums, who knows.</li>
    <li> Fits the Wahl clip n trim purchased about 2006. Looks like also lots of other Wahl. Well packaged, no blade oil included. No complaints.</li>
    <li> factory replacement  parts , only reason why the originals were replaced was the cutter was dropped and it crushed the teeth together .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head since probably 1998. I had a Wahl hair clipper from the mid 90&#x27;s that was the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned but once the blade chipped I retired it under the cabinet and didn&#x27;t use it very often. I bought and went through many other clippers after that and none of them were ever as sharp or efficient as my old trusty Wahl clipper. So I took it out again and started using it even with a chipped blade, it got the job done but I had to be extra careful. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think to look before but I decided to see if you can replace the blades and low and behold you can! I found this replacement blade set and it&#x27;s now back in it&#x27;s prime working condition again! So happy I found this replacement set!</li>
    <li> This was really needed since the clipper fell and the blade guard was chip. Love the fact that a new blade came with it making hair cutting a breeze.</li>
    <li> I finally replaced the dull blades on my hair clippers that I&#x27;ve had for over 10 years. These work fine and are very sharp. The points on them are a little too sharp, use caution when you first start using them. When you first put them on, make sure you get the blades parallel or you will get an uneven cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find someone local to sharpen my blades instead of replace them, but for the money this is a better option than replacing the whole clipper.</li>
    <li> I cut my husbands hair and our razor got dropped and the blade chipped. We ordered this replacement head and it was a perfect match for what we needed.</li>
    <li> is not as sharp as I would like it to be to cut the dogs fur.</li>
    <li> Blades came quickly and fit perfectly.  I was also amazed by how much better the clippers cut with these new, sharper blades.  At this price, I&#x27;d recommend replacing the blades annually, especially if you cut hair often.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Although I am glad to get replacement blade, it was hard to align in unit.  It also was so sharp the first few times I used it cutting neck line hairs short that it would cut into the skin.</li>
    <li> These blades are what they say they are.  They fit my Wahl clippers.  They came in very sharp and made my 10 year old Wahl clippers cut like they are new.  Should have changed the blades a few years ago.  The clippers were very aggressive for quite a while until the blades broken (dulled down) some.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for 10 year old clippers. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Easy to replace in your old wall clipper set. An inexpensive way to keep clippers a long time.  Much cheaper than going to a beauty store.</li>
    <li> Blades were dull and weighed taking the clippers to the shop to be sharpened or changing the blade myself. Found this online, changed the blades myself, using the simple enclosed instructions. Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Fit Wahl hair clippers, replacing worn out blades. Original package, arrived when expected.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my Wahl set.  I should have bought it long ago.  I used the old set too long.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, and brings the \\&quot;cutting edge\\&quot; back to your wahl clippers. Product as described and arrived earlier than estimated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for the past 20 years, normally when the blades get dull and start grabbing and yanking hair instead of cutting it, I trash the clippers, go to Sears and buy a new set. This time I decided to just replace the blades, it worked very well with this set of blades, replacement was a snap and they work just like a new set. I&#x27;d definitely recommend  this as it saved me probably $25 bucks or so versus buying a whole new set of clippers.</li>
    <li> We werent sure if this was the exact ones but when it arrived, it was the same exact set that the factory installed originally. Very sharp and works 100% perfectly,</li>
    <li> This was an exact fit for a replacement.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking to replace dull or broken blades.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the blades on my two clippers. They are still holding strong and cutting well. I shave my dog with these regularly</li>
    <li> The blade set works well. I had a set of Wahl clippers from Walmart and these fit the clippers. The only problem I had was getting the clippers to line up correctly and not move when tightening the screws.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]]. Easy and fast to replace. Original Wahl OEM part.</li>
    <li> Good replacement blades for my trimmer</li>
    <li> fast and works perfect</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as described. Switched out old blades. The clippers are like new again. Simple and easy. I would order again, in the future.</li>
    <li> Buy these all the time. I use them to groom yorkies and it beats having to buy new clippers. Think this is the third time to buy these for myself and have been very happy every time. Thank You</li>
    <li> Bought these after the blades on my clipper broke (fell off the sink while cleaning). I actually think these are sharper then the ones that came on the clippers.</li>
    <li> Easy to swap out with the old blades and even arrived with a tube of oil (though I use a professional grade oil).</li>
    <li> I could&#x27;t have gotten the package in any sooner when my son-in-law put it in use.  He recommends the blade set highly.</li>
    <li> I was able to just &amp;#34;plug and play&amp;#34; onto my existing Wahl clippers. I was able to shave my balls with ease.</li>
    <li> Like all Wahl replacement parts, these work perfectly......</li>
    <li> I recently bought a Wahl clipper.  The first few days I had it, I banged the blades into a doorjamb. The original blades are very delicate and broke easily.  I ordered and installed these blades and found them to be much more sturdy and robust than the original gear.  The cutting quality is slightly diminished.  I prefer the sturdier blades, though.  I live in a rough and tumble household and expect these new blades to fare much better than the originals.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement blade</li>
    <li> I bought these blades to replace the two year old blades in my Wahl clippers.  I installed the blades using the instructions provided but the new blades were loud and grabbed/pulled hair when I tried to use them.  I was tempted to return them, but inspected them first and realized the machined surfaces on the inside of the blades (where the two slide against each other) were a little rough near the teeth cuts.  I ran the blades across a sharpening stone a few times and knocked down the roughness, wiped down the blades, oiled them and put them back on and they work fine now.  These are nice, sharp replacement blades but I shouldn&#x27;t have to debur or hone them right out of the package.</li>
    <li> The outer blade was fine, but the inner blade arrived damaged. Since I needed it immediately, I was able to use the new outer blade with my older inner blade to get the job done. Of course now I cant return it since I used half of it. But only half arrived defective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since the day I decided it was ridiculous to wait 45 minutes at the hair cutters for a 15 minute hair cut. I&#x27;ve used many clippers and for me, the Wahl is the best made. It is heavy, made of metal and feels good in my hand. I decided I needed a new blade after my last hair cut when the Wahl started having a hard time cutting. The Wahl Blade Set - 1045 was what I needed to make my clipper new again. The new blade cut my hair like it was butter. The blade I replaced had been used for 10 years. The Wahl blades last a long time with proper care and a little blade oil. Try a new blade before you trash your clipper.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found these online.  I was searching for new clippers and was excited to see I could just purchase the blade.  This saved some money.  They worked great!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a new blade set and got just what I requested.  I didn&#x27;t have to pay much for this product and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Fit my Wahl clipper perfectly and worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> me gusto mucho las  cuchillas llego de forma rapida y segura ademas es muy lindo confortable y de buenos materiales gracia</li>
    <li> My son was expecting it very anxious and he received  it so fast!!! He was so happy because was the same thing as shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> Works Awesome! I never been so happy to cut hair before. I can hardly sleep without thinking about cutting hair.</li>
    <li> It was an exact replacement blade set that was very reasonably priced and was in fact a brand new blade! I had ordered three and am glad I did.</li>
    <li> I have used these blades for some time on my Wahl Clipper.  They are good and haven&#x27;t lost the cutting ability yet.  Inedibly you will have to change blades.  The cost wasn&#x27;t bad, and the company shipped them quickly.  Overall, very good.</li>
    <li> I broke my WAHL blade about 8 months ago. Thought I would have to buy a new set of clippers (Huge waste of money!). Saw this on Amazon and immediately bought 2 pair. The blade was a perfect fit and cheap. Cutting hair isn&#x27;t so painful anymore. Thank God!</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Works great! Will definitely  repurchase when these go dull!</li>
    <li> My husband ordered these when our original blades went dull and it works like a charm!!!  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> These restored my 10 year old clippers into better-than-new condition! Installation was straight forward, just had to play around with the alignment a little bit until it looked right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping these would come with a little bit of oil, but it&#x27;s just the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are no screws included with this kit, so you&#x27;ll need the original screws.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would improve my cuts now is a more powerful clipper because these blades cut fast and smooth. Changing the blades renewed my clippers.</li>
    <li> Totally worth it.  I have a set of clippers that have been around awhile.  They&#x27;ve been banged up over the years, hurt/scratched when rubbed wrong on the skin, and didn&#x27;t cut very well anymore.  I figured it was time to get a new clipper but decided to get just the replacement blades because I&#x27;m cheap, and I like to try to fix things instead of just replacing them.  Unfortunately not everything is made to be fixable anymore, fortunately these are.  It was really easy to put the new clippers on.  Make sure when you tighten the new ones on you align the two blades with each other.  Took me a a couple minutes of trying because the blade moves when you tighten the screw but got it right and wow what a difference.  Cuts just like a new set of clippers for less than half the price and doesn&#x27;t put more junk in our landfill that doesn&#x27;t need to be there.</li>
    <li> First off they came a day early were exactly as described and fit my clippers perfect. Simply a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Until I actually had to search for the product, I thought it was going to be very difficult to find a replacement blade for the clipper.  In fact, I was partially resigned to idea that it was going to be necessary to purchase an entirely new unit.  I was happy when I discovered that amazon carried the item at the same price it would have cost me to go find it in the brick-and-mortar stores.  Three days later, the item was delivered via mail.  It&#x27;s great when things are that easy.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement and this was the exact match.  The blade set was easy to order and received it on time.</li>
    <li> fits well. easy installation.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly on a set of clippers I bought for my dog at wal mart. The blades got dull and I couldn&#x27;t find anymore at the store so when I found them on amazon I bought rather than buy a whole new set of clippers. They fit good and are very sharp.</li>
    <li> good quality. works perfectly and was exactly what i needed.  d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d  a.</li>
    <li> Glad i bought these, they really restored my 4 yr old wahl unit. You don&#x27;t know how dull the old blades are until you replace them!</li>
