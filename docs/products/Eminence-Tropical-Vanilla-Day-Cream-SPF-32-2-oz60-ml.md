      <li>I am a huge E O advocate</li>
      <li>Eminence is still a great product and I will definitely use this while tanning in the warmer months.</li>
      <li>product is light and it blends well, no sticky cream feeling.  </li>
      <li>It does the job it says..absorbs well into the the skin without making it greasy...makes my skin look smooth and supple...</li>
      <li>Provides great protection from the sun as we are outside quite a bit these days.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ll stick with my chemical free Clarins and use with  a moisturizer in the winter...</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful moisturizer, however, you need to add a few drops of water so you can spread it evenly</li>
      <li>It is not oily or greasy feeling, plus the smell is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that&#x27;s light and fast absorbing.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on to do the job.</li>
      <li>This cream re-hydrated my aging skin and smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>The jar isn&#x27;t the original container, instead it has a printed label.</li>
      <li>Love this light but effective daily lotion!</li>
      <li>I first tried it at a spa day and fell in love with how it made my face feel.</li>

      <li>It dries quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy to the touch at all.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-it looks opaque, like mildly ghastly, on the skin</li>
      <li>I used a lot of different moisturizers and this is the one that works best on my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It is great for everyday and those fun summer activities without worrying about re-applying.</li>
      <li>It fills in any wrinkles and I rarely break out when I have it</li>
      <li>I rub it around evenly and after like 5 minutes its absorbed.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my skin, soft, and safe from the sun.</li>
      <li>you sweat, it will sweat right off</li>
      <li>but then is sinks in and is very light - not greasy at all!</li>
      <li>The smell is great and I a container will last me about 2 months (using it only in the morning on my face and neck).  </li>
      <li>I also love the extra protection of being SPF3</li>
      <li>Would recommend the Arctic Berry for hydration over this but cost is higher.</li>
      <li>I first learned about them through Burke Williams Spa.</li>
      <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve started to notice fine lines and wrinkles, my pores started to enlarge and fill up with dirt (black heads) and sunspots have been coming up more and more (even though I&#x27;ve been avoiding the sun).  </li>
      <li>Love eminence and have a lot of their products I use morning and night on a daily basis.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just like all eminence products love this</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product many times at a spa, but this product on Amazon is not genuine. The jars were not sealed, and the texture, color and scent were very different. Both jars were returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Eminence Vanilla Sun Cream since late June 2011.  I moisten my face with a touch of water, then add a pea-sized dot of cream to smooth over my face, neck, and upper chest area.  It dries quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy to the touch at all.  That&#x27;s why I love it.  I can apply my make-up immediately. I&#x27;m going to continue using this product as my sun screen and daily moisturizer all in one.  It&#x27;s wonderful for this high-altitude dry climate of Reno, NV.</li>
    <li> My skin is combination...sometimes oily, sometimes dry.  Recently, I&#x27;ve started to notice fine lines and wrinkles, my pores started to enlarge and fill up with dirt (black heads) and sunspots have been coming up more and more (even though I&#x27;ve been avoiding the sun).  So I started a Tretinoin (Retin-A) regimen.  This can sometimes leave your skin dry, flaky, and almost chapped.  I use the Eminence Red Currant Moisturizer on my whole face, but on the areas that are the most sensitive and dry (around my mouth and nose) I apply this moisturizer on top.  It works wonders without making my skin overly oily at all.  Thank goodness for this or I&#x27;d be looking like a big flake-ball at work....embarrassing!</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I Love Tropical Vanilla Day Cream SPF 32!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only sunscreen over a SPF 15 that I have found that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes!  It goes on smooth and light and really does the job!  I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I can wear every day.  I had read enough articles to know I should wear sunscreen every day but I couldn&#x27;t do it until I tried this product.  Most sunscreens smelled too strong, were too thick, burned my eyes, made my face break out - it was always something.  I started using this about four years ago and now wear it every day.  In the summer when the air is moist I use this as my lone moisturizer in the morning, in the winter I usually apply moisturizer first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is light and it blends well, no sticky cream feeling.  The smell is very light but nice.  It is a bit expensive but it only takes a little bit to get full coverage, I purchase this about every six months and that is with daily use.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Seal was broken on lid but cream apparently not used. Didn&#x27;t want to hasstle with returning. Cream pretty thick, doesn&#x27;t seems to hydrate all that well. Would recommend the Arctic Berry for hydration over this but cost is higher. For the price could find another product that works better.</li>
    <li> eminence has done it again .. this is a great spf cream ...... I use on top of my other eminence day cream .. mix this with a little sparking water, emulsify in hand .... a little goes a long way .. and pat all over .... face neck décolleté  !  no white not if you do it correctly : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;clean and non clogging</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and my husband has dry skin. We both use this daily for our lotion and SPF. We can both go out on the boat all day and never re apply and not get a single bit of burn on our face. It is not oily or greasy feeling, plus the smell is fantastic. It is great for everyday and those fun summer activities without worrying about re-applying.</li>
    <li> luv this product for my Neck and Chest. Not greasy!</li>
    <li> I am 27 with tan, combination type skin. I liked using this but it made my face sweat a lot. I found myself blotting sweat constantly from my face throughout the day. When I use non SPF products from this line, I do not sweat at all. I am speculating that this product may contain some ingredient that is comedogenic. I don&#x27;t know if I will be repurchasing based on my individual experience.</li>
    <li> Not only a great skin cream but has SPF, safe ingredients also!!</li>
    <li> Smells  AMAZING, works even better..I use every day, under makeup or alone..I am a huge E O advocate I can not say anything bad about any of their products!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have used for nearly a year.  I use to suffer from very dry skin but since using this product I do not get the dry spots on my face.  I also love the extra protection of being SPF3&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
    <li> It does the job it says..absorbs well into the the skin without making it greasy...makes my skin look smooth and supple...I would recommend this product to everyone who can afford it..</li>
    <li> This sunscreen smells so good and works great.  I love it! :)</li>
    <li> I love this facial cream. I live in south florida and I use this on my face and neck every morning. It keeps my skin, soft, and safe from the sun. I highly recommend this Eminence Tropical Vanilla Day Cream spf 32.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eminence for almost a year - the skin firming cleanser, serum and moisturizer but I wanted something for summer with SPF. I love this day cream! It&#x27;s seems like a very thick, heavy cream but then is sinks in and is very light - not greasy at all! It smells like cake frosting (kinda feels like it, too!).</li>
    <li> Smells great and all natural ingredients with 32 SPF. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I used a lot of different moisturizers and this is the one that works best on my dry skin.  My skin is no a lot softer and less oily that in the past. It is a bit expensive but you only need to use a little bit so lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth and you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on to do the job. It&#x27;s also very hydrating. I would recommend this cream to anyone who is carefull about what they put on their skin.</li>
    <li> I love this.  The smell, the way it goes on, the consistency, how my skin absorbs it EVERYTHING.  If you are prone to breakouts (I am too) I wouldn&#x27;t run away from this product, I&#x27;d give it a try!  Love eminence and have a lot of their products I use morning and night on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen and smells like you could eat it. These are the best organic products, made of fruits, veggies and herbs, all natural.</li>
    <li> Have been using for approx 6 weeks. Provides great protection from the sun as we are outside quite a bit these days. I&#x27;ve had no issue with skin irritation or breakouts as I do have fairly sensitive skin. Was initially concerned about the quantity given the price, however, a little does go a long way so I have no complaints. Overall very pleased!</li>
    <li> I live in Las Vegas and it is soooooo sunny.  I am 36 and although I stay out of the sun like a Vampire most of the time I still longed for a good face cream with SPF.  I tried everything over the counter.  I even tried one from a dermatologist.  They all broke me out in an unpleasant under the skin kind of way.  I researched it and realized they all have harsh chemicals in them including demethicone.  When I saw this product I read the ingredients and it seemed like it would work but I was still afraid, ha!  I tried it and I am so glad I did because I am protected when I do venture outside and I haven&#x27;t had 1 break out from it.  It has a nice vanilla-ish smell.  Like other reviewers said it goes on white but don&#x27;t used to much.  I use maybe like a flat 1/2 of the spoon they give you sized amount after other skin care products like vitamin c and a little glycerin.  I rub it around evenly and after like 5 minutes its absorbed.  once I put to much and had some dried white patches, so careful on the application but its really trial and error.  The only qualm I had was when I received it it was not sealed and had a tiny little discoloration where the seal was not sealed.  I don&#x27;t think It was because someone used it, I think more likely it popped open during transport because of pressure changes.  I  have had no ill effects because if it but I hope the next one I buy is sealed.</li>
    <li> It pills and doesn&#x27;t absorb all the way. I wanted to like it bc it is all natural but I&#x27;m not a big fan.</li>
    <li> I like almost every product I purchased from Eminence but their sunscreens! This one is too thick and waxy and just pills off my face no matter! Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My skin looks softer and younger. I highly recommend all these products. I first learned about them through Burke Williams Spa.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning, rain or shine. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that&#x27;s light and fast absorbing. And it smells great! But lest you think it&#x27;s just a moisturizer, the sunscreen also works really well. I&#x27;ve gone out hiking or at the beach for a daylong adventure and have never had to reapply and have not burned. This stuff is great and I love that it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eminence for 4 years and am finally taking the time to write this review. Love, love, love the tropical vanilla day crème in particular. It is so light and hydrates beautifully! I&#x27;ve even gotten my husband to start using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several years and absolutely cannot live without it!  I have a family history of skin cancer and wanted to find a moisturizer that had at least an SPF 30 and was good for very dry skin, but didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  This moisturizer has exceeded my expectations. The Tropical Vanilla Day Cream keeps me hydrated throughout the day.  Unlike other moisturizers with sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on a humid day or after I go to the gym. The smell is great and I a container will last me about 2 months (using it only in the morning on my face and neck).  While it might seem a little pricey, my skin has never looked better since I started using Eminence products, so it is worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Item was as listed. Quick delivery</li>
    <li> I use this cream all the time; it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Yummy scent, but not overly tropical. Love how it melts into my face. I&#x27;m a 2 time Melanoma victor so SPF is a must - every single day.</li>
    <li> At first glance, all looked well. It arrived in a factory box.  However, when I opended the jar the seal was already broken. The jar isn&#x27;t the original container, instead it has a printed label. The cream inside the container is not Eminence Tropical Vanilla Day Cream.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is really nice.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet, buthopefully per the other reviews, it will be a great face cream. Also, delivery really fast.</li>
    <li> I honestly thought this was a moisturizer with SPF when I ordered it, but realized when I received it to be a sunscreen. Eminence is still a great product and I will definitely use this while tanning in the warmer months.</li>
    <li> This sun protection will moisturize AND protect your skin against the sun&#x27;s rays without chemicals!  I use it year-round.  It&#x27;s the last thing I put on before applying any makeup.</li>
    <li> The consistency was very waxy.  Did not feel good on my skin at all.  Had to wash it off about 30 minutes later.  I have rosecea and need something more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I got turned on to this cream from my day spa and purchased it here for much less. It is a good SPF and leaves my skin very soft. It fills in any wrinkles and I rarely break out when I have it (it&#x27;s when I&#x27;m between purchases that are the problem). I would say it&#x27;s about medium on the heaviness/thickness and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Only buy this from an authorized retailer, the one I bought on here was already opened and had a yellow ring around the top</li>
    <li> Beware!  Contains a chemical sunscreen associated with reproductive disorders. It IS listed as an ingredient in the product description.  Waaaaay overpriced for a cream with a chemical sunscreen in it.  Thick enough for winter skin.  Smells great.  However, I&#x27;ll stick with my chemical free Clarins and use with  a moisturizer in the winter...the search continues.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer, however, you need to add a few drops of water so you can spread it evenly</li>
    <li> I had been using Philosophy products for some time until the woman who does my facials gave me some Emminence samples.  I&#x27;m hooked!  Being fair skinned, I have to wear sunscreen all the time.  Most of them have a horrible smell or aren&#x27;t moisturizing.  This one is fantastic!  Great smell and really does the job as my morning moisturizer.  It goes on a little thick a first but soaks in in a few minutes.  And it has a very light scent that is not medicinal like other sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I wear this under makeup and, so far, have not had any problem with shine.</li>
    <li> I first tried this at a spa in Kauai and I loved it...not oily and a very good sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Product wasn&#x27;t sealed and seemed like some was missing. I worked in a medical spa so I&#x27;m aware of what it looks like when you first receive it.  I was in desperate need for it for Christmas gift</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! This has the spf in it for your face. I use it all year round and never have any major issues. I love the way it smells, it&#x27;s nice and light yet moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This product  has a wonderful aroma like all Eminence products. This is a delightful moisturizer during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I refrigerate all my organic products and love the feel on my skin!</li>
    <li> Love this product. No paba sunscreen  and leaves my skin soft and protected from ultra violet rays.</li>
    <li> Love this light but effective daily lotion!</li>
    <li> This has been an incredibly reliable product for my sensitive and acne prone skin. The scent and texture are wonderful. Most importantly, I never break out from it. I get sun protection and clear skin. Win.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy this product because I ran out of it. I love how it does not make my face oily at all which I do have combination skin and I wear it before I put my makeup on. I usually would wear moisturizer with SPF in it but I quit using it and just wear the  Vanilla Sun Cream.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t tolerate the sun well and this day cream works really well without causing any irritation or redness. Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin and am 28 years old. This is great! Not too heavy but still moisturizes with spf! AND it smells like heaven, yet not perfume-ish. I&#x27;ve honestly never liked any other spf face lotion and I&#x27;ve tried tons! My mom has older normal to dry skin and loves it as well.</li>
    <li> This is a good sunscreen cream. Smells luscious. A little pricey though.</li>
    <li> form eastern Europe and on their website saying jessica biel is also a fan of this specific product. but i found it becomes debris after putting too much on the face, maybe it dries out naturally? and why spf 32? not 30 or 15 or 50? and it&#x27;s funny to read comments on paula choice website</li>
    <li> I love the smell and lightness and protection provided, but minus two stars because with my particular skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s hard to rub in/absorbs poorly: sometimes little flaky white pieces never dissolve&lt;br /&gt;-if you sweat, it will sweat right off&lt;br /&gt;-it looks opaque, like mildly ghastly, on the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus side: It smells lovely and when I did wear it, I never got burnt wearing it even in intense Australian sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end, I ended up using it on my chest and arms instead of on my face as intended, because constant facial reapplication of a poor facial product is no fun. If you wear it in a tropical or humid place, be prepared to put it on multiple times as it quickly sweats off. Regardless of your location (as with other sun products) try to apply it 20-30 minutes before you go out in the sun, for better chances of absorption.</li>
    <li> excellent  for sunny days</li>
    <li> use it everyday--light yet hydrating. Smells like a vanilla creme sicle. Have used it for a year now and was thrilled to find it online.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and a great sunblock . Nice smell too .</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect amount of moisture. Never looks or feels oily.&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen works great.&lt;br /&gt;Buying my second tub today</li>
    <li> I would recommend this cream to anyone that is looking for a nice face cream.  I have been using it for over a year now and love it.  I first tried it at a spa day and fell in love with how it made my face feel.</li>
    <li> This is a great daytime moisturizer and the SPF 32 makes it a fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve only been using Eminence products for six months and can already see the difference in my skin.  My pores are tighter and my skin just glows!</li>
    <li> I have used Eminence products for about 4 years now.  My skin looks great and I love everything I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> This was recomended by the stylist mywife used for our wedding.  She tried it and loved it.  So now I buy it when ever she runs out. A little more than once a year.</li>
    <li> This lotion rubs in nicely and smells amazing. I just love Eminence.</li>
    <li> My skin was drying out from the freezing cold Colorado weather (the state has been setting records for cold temps this winter). This cream re-hydrated my aging skin and smells fantastic. I love, love, love it!</li>
