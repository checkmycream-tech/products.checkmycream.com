      <li>I didn&#x27;t like how many steps it took to get all you want or need on.</li>
      <li>I had used the Arbonne RE9 series and fell in love with the product.</li>

      <li>A fabulous way to wake or go to bed!</li>
      <li>I have since lost contact with the Arbonne rep and am so glad that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The product was exactly as advertised, the price was good, and arrived on schedule.</li>
      <li>and this does not irritate and it makes my skin feel very smooth and clean..</li>
      <li>It leaves your face silky smooth and has reduced my spots as well</li>
      <li>Product keeps my skin oil free all day.</li>
      <li>I used it, and the first few days i had a few pimples (WHICH IS GOOD, because it means that it&#x27;s cleaning all the dirt under the surface) and After 3 days, my skin was as bright and beautiful as a doll!!!  </li>
      <li>My face feels so clean &amp; toned.</li>
      <li>my skins feels clean and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>I love this product so much I buy 2 at a time.</li>
      <li>and you only need a drop to get a good lather</li>
      <li>You just really cannot find a better face wash out there.</li>
      <li>At $25 the Cleanser/Toner is actually a pretty good deal, and if you&#x27;re a Preferred Client you get 20% off, so it&#x27;s only $20.</li>
      <li>I use the Cleanser/Toner in conjunction with the 20 spf Day Cream and the Mattifying Powder and love them all so far!</li>
      <li>This is the BEST toner and cleanser on the market, hands down!!!!</li>
      <li>but it is really worth it and</li>
      <li>I have never received so many compliments on how clear my skin looks.</li>
      <li>its worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price</li>
      <li>and i LOVE that it&#x27;s all natural and no animal testing etc.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin with huge pores and this cleanser has helped me so much!  </li>
      <li>I had previously used this product and loved it.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was a gimic to make money</li>
      <li>The smallest drop, get a great lather going in your hands, gently rub on &amp; slowly splash face.</li>
      <li>I also use a popular brand dark spot corrector after washing.  </li>
      <li>I know that you&#x27;re not supposed to touch your face, but I&#x27;m having a hard time keep my hands away because the skin feel so good.</li>
      <li>This was much easier that getting it from my Arbonne rep.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear make up and don&#x27;t really care for beauty products.</li>
      <li>I have very picky skin</li>
      <li>This has really improved my skin.</li>
      <li>And, if you REALLY want to treat yourself, add the clay mask that is part of this line.</li>
      <li>This helps to keep my skin clear and smooth with daily use.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products and wasted so much money on facials and products.  </li>
      <li>These are not cheap products, so I really hope the company invests in a better container.</li>
      <li>By far, it is better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>The product is ok (except the lid doesn&#x27;t close) but it was not worth the wait/cost!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and leaves my skin smooth with less oil overall after using it for a little more than a month.  </li>
      <li>Arbonne products are botanically based and are a free of animal byproducts, glycerin and all of the other yucky stuff that comes in off the shelf products which contaminate your skin and clog your pores causing breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I cannot live without this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I have easily lost over half of each bottle this way, and forget about transporting them.</li>
      <li>But, after a few weeks of fantastic performance from it, including clearing up the pregnancy-inducted acne that was plaguing me, I&#x27;ve purchased the eye creme and oil absorbing lotion that goes in this set.</li>
      <li>My face has never been this clear!  </li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s cheaper than buying from the Arbonne rep direct.</li>
      <li>My friends have been chatting about arbonne products I decided to give it a try, wow</li>
      <li>All natural, not oily...</li>
      <li>I  tried this because I know Arbonne makes all natural products</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how it only takes a very small amount to rid my face of all of the foundation and mascara</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s a russian woman&#x27;s beauty secret for amazing skin).</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re face will feel clean, refreshed and completely purged without that tight, dry feeling that often comes with purifying type products.</li>
      <li>I received the Purifying Cleanser/Toner yesterday and have only used it twice so far, but I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>It does not dry my skin or create excess oil.</li>
      <li>This is by far the most expensive cleansing product I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>I am surprised how long this product is lasting me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything that kept my skin clearer than this! Worth the price and you only need a drop to get a good lather so it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night to remove my make up. It&#x27;s amazing how it only takes a very small amount to rid my face of all of the foundation and mascara I use. By far, it is better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. From store brands to department store brands (I used to use the Clinique set for Oily skin which didn&#x27;t work at all for me) I am surprised how long this product is lasting me. I bought it back in May and I&#x27;m still using the same one now! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I am by no means a girlie girl. I don&#x27;t wear make up and don&#x27;t really care for beauty products. A co-worker was hosting an Arbonne party and I attended and made a \\&quot;mercy\\&quot; buy. This is what I selected since it seemed to be an all in one type of product. This has really improved my skin. I have never received so many compliments on how clear my skin looks. It does not dry my skin or create excess oil. I&#x27;m giving some to my sister so she can try it out. I have since lost contact with the Arbonne rep and am so glad that I was able to find it on Amazon. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper than buying from the Arbonne rep direct.</li>
    <li> You just really cannot find a better face wash out there. I have combination oily/dry acne prone skin with melasma. I have tried so many products and wasted so much money on facials and products.  However, when I started using this with a regular Buf-Puf it started working wonders. I also use a popular brand dark spot corrector after washing.  My skin has NEVER looked better! Also, my acne break outs have tremendously decreased as well.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this face cleanser!</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for a face wash that isn&#x27;t too harsh on skin but still cleans my face. This is perfect. It is also a toner which is something I need since I have a few dark spots. It leaves your face silky smooth and has reduced my spots as well</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. So why only 3 stars? Well, it&#x27;s the packaging. I&#x27;ve purchased 4 tubes over the past year or so, and no matter which way I store them (even with the opening up in the air, it defies gravity), each and every one of them leaks like a sieve. I have easily lost over half of each bottle this way, and forget about transporting them. I had to transfer the contents into other bottles, which was not a big deal, but neither should be a leak proof design. These are not cheap products, so I really hope the company invests in a better container.</li>
    <li> Arbonne truly has some great products and this is one of them!  This product is especially nice as you get not only a cleanser but a toner too.  All in one product.  It&#x27;s like getting two products, for the price of one.</li>
    <li> The best cleanser I have used.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This cleanser makes my skin less shiny and I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts. On top of that it saves a step since it&#x27;s a cleanser and toner in one. It smells awesome too!</li>
    <li> The Arbonne FC5 purifying cleanser and toner is amazing! Initially, I purchased just this product. But, after a few weeks of fantastic performance from it, including clearing up the pregnancy-inducted acne that was plaguing me, I&#x27;ve purchased the eye creme and oil absorbing lotion that goes in this set. And, if you REALLY want to treat yourself, add the clay mask that is part of this line. So, if you&#x27;re a little unsure of whether or not to buy this product, I would hit the \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot; button now! You&#x27;re face will feel clean, refreshed and completely purged without that tight, dry feeling that often comes with purifying type products. Not to mention, it smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this cleanser.  I have oily skin and after using FC5 purifying cleanser and toner my skins feels clean and refreshed.  The best part is how soft my skin is after washing my face.  Arbonne products are botanically based and are a free of animal byproducts, glycerin and all of the other yucky stuff that comes in off the shelf products which contaminate your skin and clog your pores causing breakouts.  With that being said, arbonne has natural ingredients and because of this your eyes will never burn and it has a wonderful smell.  At first I thought it was a gimic to make money but it is really worth it and the best part is it last 6 to 9 months.  Do you research on the ingredients in off the shelf soaps and lotions and you too will switch to arbonne and love it!</li>
    <li> This was my most disappointing purchase ever on Amazon. You see, you can&#x27;t use a product that never arrives. I ordered the Arbonne FC5 Purifying Cleanser + Toner on May 9th with a very slow guaranteed delivery of June 1st. It never arrived. When I contacted the seller through Amazon, they ignored me and never responded. Here it is June 9th and still no product. Buyer Beware!!! This seller is terrible. The product itself is excellent though. Do yourself a big favor and order from someone who will actually ship to you!</li>
    <li> It took over a month to receive this package. When I finally got it, the box was all beaten up and torn. The product is ok (except the lid doesn&#x27;t close) but it was not worth the wait/cost!</li>
    <li> Is my favorite clearing soap</li>
    <li> This is by far the most expensive cleansing product I have ever purchased. It&#x27;s nice becuase it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some peroxide based cleaners do. It smells like a fruit salad. A small amount goes a long way, so the tube lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> The BEST Face Wash period. It last myself (even when the husband steals it to use) for MONTHS. The smallest drop, get a great lather going in your hands, gently rub on &amp; slowly splash face. It&#x27;s been my favorite (and easiest) got to wash for over 4 years now!</li>
    <li> Wife and girls love the product.</li>
    <li> I was &#x27;accidentally&#x27; turned on to Arbonne products - attending a party and assuming I would not really purchase anything.  Since (for about 4 months) I have not used anything else and do not plan to- by FAR the best product line I have ever used on my skin (and I have used a TON like many of women!) I do like this cleanser and moisturizer (night), as well as the RE9 line.  You will not be disappointed in any Arbonne purchases; for once I feel like my skin is balanced and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service</li>
    <li> I love this product.. I have been using it for two years and I wouldn&#x27;t want to use anything else...</li>
    <li> I received the Purifying Cleanser/Toner yesterday and have only used it twice so far, but I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. My skin is softer and smoother to the touch. This product doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or tight, which is a typical issue that I have with other cleansers, and I&#x27;m hoping that this trend continues! The other plus? Toner is mixed with the cleanser so it eliminates a step in the process. I use the Cleanser/Toner in conjunction with the 20 spf Day Cream and the Mattifying Powder and love them all so far! I know that you&#x27;re not supposed to touch your face, but I&#x27;m having a hard time keep my hands away because the skin feel so good. At $25 the Cleanser/Toner is actually a pretty good deal, and if you&#x27;re a Preferred Client you get 20% off, so it&#x27;s only $20.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve tried almost every cleanser and toner imaginable. My sister was selling arbonne so she suggested this product to me. I was very doubtful at using it, since i had acne and blackheads (eww). I used it, and the first few days i had a few pimples (WHICH IS GOOD, because it means that it&#x27;s cleaning all the dirt under the surface) and After 3 days, my skin was as bright and beautiful as a doll!!!  My skin has never looked this good or this beautiful, and i STRONGLY STRONGLY recommend that you buy it. you wont be disappointed. It&#x27;s PERFECT.  It also has strawberry extracts, which is AMAZING for the skin. (it&#x27;s a russian woman&#x27;s beauty secret for amazing skin). and i LOVE that it&#x27;s all natural and no animal testing etc.  This is the BEST toner and cleanser on the market, hands down!!!!</li>
    <li> Product keeps my skin oil free all day.</li>
    <li> All natural, not oily... I have very picky skin and this does not irritate and it makes my skin feel very smooth and clean..</li>
    <li> I  tried this because I know Arbonne makes all natural products and I wanted a cleanser that also toned. Cuts down on bottles,also!  FC5 smells citrusy.  A fabulous way to wake or go to bed! I  recommend tis product to everyone what&#x27;s their skin to fell outstanding!</li>
    <li> This cleanser/toner is amazing. You get what you pay for, its worth every penny.  Good lather and scent.  My skin looked more even and radiant.</li>
    <li> I had used the Arbonne RE9 series and fell in love with the product. I didn&#x27;t like how many steps it took to get all you want or need on. I decided to try the FC5 cleanser + toner and fell in love.</li>
    <li> Love the product, will buy again from seller!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin with huge pores and this cleanser has helped me so much!  I was dubious due to the price tag and I did have a mini breakout after 1 week, but having pushed through the breakout, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my skin.  It&#x27;s worth the money and leaves my skin smooth with less oil overall after using it for a little more than a month.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had bad acne for most of my life, I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and still break out.  My friends have been chatting about arbonne products I decided to give it a try, wow I love it!  My face has never been this clear!  I&#x27;ve now ordered the primer and cc cream to try!  Def recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much I buy 2 at a time. My face feels so clean &amp; toned. I get a lot of complements from my customers about my skin</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as advertised, the price was good, and arrived on schedule. I had previously used this product and loved it. This was much easier that getting it from my Arbonne rep. I&#x27;m a 38 year old woman with combination skin and a very active outdoor lifestyle in Florida. This helps to keep my skin clear and smooth with daily use. My skin went crazy when I ran out for 2 weeks.</li>
