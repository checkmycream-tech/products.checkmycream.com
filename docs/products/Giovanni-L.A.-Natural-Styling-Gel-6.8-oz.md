      <li>first then the other Love this stuff and its chemical Free!!!</li>
      <li>It would be nice, if you call yourself natural and brag about your &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>full review is at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Crunched out a small amount of crunch and had beautiful frizz free and full of body hair.</li>
      <li>Also you don&#x27;t need much product to get the effect, its not sticky and has a very fresh light scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The ingredients are mostly organic, have no icky &#x27;parabens or chemicals, and is all vegetarian.</li>
      <li>It adds a lot of body and keeps it looking nice for the next non-washing day.  </li>
      <li>i have genetic hair loss problem&lt;br /&gt;it feels natural and healthy</li>
      <li>But am pleased so far.</li>
      <li>While the Paul Mitchell Gel doesn&#x27;t claim to be natural it does do a better job of not creating build-up and residue.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it never fails to keep my hair scrunched, curled and gets me out the door with the wash and wear look that I like.</li>
      <li>A friend suggested this line of products and upon my first use, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I have white hair that I&#x27;m growing out, and I need some oomph to make it look cute and curly.  </li>
      <li>so much</li>
      <li>My son uses this for a very styled look.  </li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair, but I help it keep a more ringlet look with Hair Rules Curly Whip, which is applied on soaking wet hair right out of the shower.[[ASIN:B001V6SN5</li>
      <li>Put a fair amount in my wet hair and let air dry.</li>
      <li>When  I tried it the first time I knew it was something I&#x27;d  always use because it&#x27;s natural...</li>
      <li>am allergic to everything and usually have to compromise by using products that are less than ideal.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>This gel might costs a few dollars more than you typical bottle, but it&#x27;s so much better than just about anything else I tried.</li>
      <li>The curls reform and with a bit of a skrunch after applying the gel, the top has a little lift.  </li>
      <li>I like that it is supposed to be all natural (whatever that really means).</li>
      <li>Strong enough without making your hair feel like wood, only mildly shiny and leave no flakes whatsoever, no matter how long you keep it on.</li>
      <li>It not only has an ingredient list that doesn&#x27;t make a person cringe, it also works better than any other hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Anyways, Giovanni is about as natural as Pamela Anderson&#x27;s chest, let&#x27;s not kid anybody.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been seaching for products to maintain my natural hair.  </li>
      <li>They market it as natural but it isn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Not heavy, if used sparingly.</li>
      <li>Natural huh?  </li>
      <li>Do these ingredients look natural... VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to call yourself natural shouldn&#x27;t you be...</li>
      <li>I also appreciate that this product washes out completely and doesn&#x27;t flake when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A small amount is all I need and I can curl my hair the second day without adding more or wetting it.  </li>
      <li>I have been trying so many lately and finally decided to try this one.</li>
      <li>It is way too thick and doesn&#x27;t wash out easily.</li>
      <li>This is the only gel I ever use on my curly hair, since I started going with all natural products.  </li>
      <li>, as opposed to other gels I&#x27;ve tried, is that this one leaves your hair feeling soft, silky and natural, but still holds the shape I want.</li>
      <li>all I have to do is dab a little on and it&#x27;ll hold really well.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been seaching for products to maintain my natural hair.  A friend suggested this line of products and upon my first use, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will have to evaluate the cost effectiveness; as I have long, thick hair and product usually depletes quickly.  But am pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I love this gel. all I have to do is dab a little on and it&#x27;ll hold really well. The following day, I re-moisten my hair with a spritz of water/Apple Cider vinegar/glycerin, and the gel that I&#x27;ve already put in my hair essentially re-activates, and I can go over that process for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are mostly organic, have no icky &#x27;parabens or chemicals, and is all vegetarian.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gel that was a healthier for my husband and this is it. He has thick wavy hair and it holds all day without the flaking.</li>
    <li> This gel might costs a few dollars more than you typical bottle, but it&#x27;s so much better than just about anything else I tried. Strong enough without making your hair feel like wood, only mildly shiny and leave no flakes whatsoever, no matter how long you keep it on.</li>
    <li> One thing I do not like about it, is that It has an odd smell.  It works like any other gel. I use it in combination with other Giovanni products.</li>
    <li> Gives thickness to your hair.</li>
    <li> i have genetic hair loss problem&lt;br /&gt;it feels natural and healthy&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t like the smell. it&#x27;s kinda herbal smell&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s ok&lt;br /&gt;by the way i used better gel types</li>
    <li> I love this gel. I have been trying so many lately and finally decided to try this one. I think this is my favorite. Held my curls and no frizz. Put a fair amount in my wet hair and let air dry. Crunched out a small amount of crunch and had beautiful frizz free and full of body hair. I think I found another holy grail in this one.</li>
    <li> Did not hold my hair as I have expected . Makes my thin hair limp</li>
    <li> Manly smell.  If you are a woman, you may not like this.  I didn&#x27;t.  Gave it to my sons.</li>
    <li> Really great gel for giving a polished, finished look to any type of style. A little goes a long way and its not gooey or sticky.</li>
    <li> I use this gel with B5 design Gel by Aubrey it creates a balance add the Giovanni first then the other Love this stuff and its chemical Free!!!</li>
    <li> My son uses this for a very styled look.  It stays all day, even through sports and washes out clean.</li>
    <li> Best gel I have ever used. Makes hair shiny, too. Not heavy, if used sparingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good alternative to the chemical hair gel nightmares out there for a long time. This is a GREAT product. It not only has an ingredient list that doesn&#x27;t make a person cringe, it also works better than any other hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands over the years. I also appreciate that this product washes out completely and doesn&#x27;t flake when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my full review is at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;myreallifereviews dot com</li>
    <li> Aside from perms, this has to be the worst product I have ever put on my hair!!  Left my hair rock hard and incredibly dry...so much so I was afraid my strands would literally snap like dry pasta!</li>

    <li> I use quite a lot of this on my wet hair, then blow it out.  It adds a lot of body and keeps it looking nice for the next non-washing day.  I like that it is supposed to be all natural (whatever that really means).</li>
    <li> Is very good for curly girls</li>
    <li> Natural huh?  Do these ingredients look natural... VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol.  I don&#x27;t think so.  If you&#x27;re going to call yourself natural shouldn&#x27;t you be...can&#x27;t there be truth in advertising?&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I used this and I got a lot of build-up and residue, unlike the Paul Mitchell Clean Gel I used.  While the Paul Mitchell Gel doesn&#x27;t claim to be natural it does do a better job of not creating build-up and residue.  Anyways, Giovanni is about as natural as Pamela Anderson&#x27;s chest, let&#x27;s not kid anybody.  It would be nice, if you call yourself natural and brag about your &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; technology, if you actually lived up to it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Always liked this product. When  I tried it the first time I knew it was something I&#x27;d  always use because it&#x27;s natural...</li>
    <li> Perfect!  This is the best gel I have ever used.  NO FLAKING AT ALL!!  Even after using it daily for the last 3 days.</li>
    <li> Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to everything and usually have to compromise by using products that are less than ideal.  Not so with this hair gel.  It is terrific.  A small amount is all I need and I can curl my hair the second day without adding more or wetting it.  No flake, no stiffness. Hair holds great and feels soft.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair, but I help it keep a more ringlet look with Hair Rules Curly Whip, which is applied on soaking wet hair right out of the shower.[[ASIN:B001V6SN5G Hair Rules Curly Whip - 16 oz]]. I also wanted a product that would refresh my curls, as well as give me a little &#x27;lift&#x27; to the crown.  My daughter recommended LA Natural Styling Gel and it is perfect.  I can use it either on dry hair or water-spritzed hair.  The curls reform and with a bit of a skrunch after applying the gel, the top has a little lift.  What I like most, as opposed to other gels I&#x27;ve tried, is that this one leaves your hair feeling soft, silky and natural, but still holds the shape I want. Also you don&#x27;t need much product to get the effect, its not sticky and has a very fresh light scent. I was unable to find it in my local stores but once again, Amazon comes to the rescue with having most things I need and which so conveniently arrive at my door.</li>
    <li> I love this hair gel! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it never fails to keep my hair scrunched, curled and gets me out the door with the wash and wear look that I like. Plus it is a safe and responsible product with no harmful, carcinogenic ingredients!</li>
