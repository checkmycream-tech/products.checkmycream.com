      <li>It is my favorite Philosophy perfume.</li>
      <li>Just wish it had more staying power.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>After three, it&#x27;s more of a lingering glimpse of a scent rather than a fullbodied one.</li>
      <li>I buy this every year for my daughter because it is her favorite fragrence.</li>
      <li>It has great staying power (which I can&#x27;t really say about Burberry perfumes, but I love their scents)</li>

      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Just clean, simple, and happy!  </li>
      <li>Love the light scent--sophisticated, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I also wear Philosophy Grace fragrance and enjoy that one as well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really light, clean scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and clean.</li>
      <li>It is my absolute favorite of their line.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this as I can no longer find it elsewhere and is a particular favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>I got lucky and bought this at a discount store.</li>
      <li>The price is right and the shipment arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>So sad to see this fragrance discontinued by Philosophy, but happy to be able to still purchase on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Great for summer when you don&#x27;t want anything too heavy.</li>
      <li>Really fresh floral notes.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>LOVE this smell, especially with my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is described here perfectly: crisp, floral and citrus.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for several years and really enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>It is light and feminine with a romantic edge.....</li>
      <li>I used to be a Vera Wang Princess kind of person, but never really caught on to the super girly, heavy scent.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d give Philosphy&#x27;s new fragrance a shot, but this one just doesn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
      <li>I have almost all of the Philosophy fragrances and am always checking for new ones.  </li>
      <li>I sprayed myself with this stuff and many hours later my stepmom who hates my usual smoe smell under fragrance told me she wanted whatever I was wearing!</li>
      <li>I usually wear original Burberry or Burberry London in the fall</li>
      <li>I have used other high end fragrance</li>

<li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a \\&quot;5\\&quot; is because it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>

<li> Eternal Grace is my FAVORITE summer/daytime perfume, and I am so disappointed that it is discontinued...</li>
<li> This is one of the few scents that does not trigger a negative reaction for my sensitive skin or palate.  </li>
<li> The fragrance dries down and smells almost medicinal, even offensive, or perhaps it just doesn&#x27;t interact with my body chemistry well.</li>
<li> It is so hard to find anymore......</li>
<li> I am the sort of girl who has never liked perfumes and often found them nauseating.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s subtle and mellow.  </li>
<li> So sad it is now discontinued.  </li>
<li> I am so sad that Philosophy has discontinued this fragrance.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;ve always hated perfume, consider giving Philosophy a try.</li>
<li> In any case, I was very disappointed and won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I used to be a Vera Wang Princess kind of person, but never really caught on to the super girly, heavy scent. This one is perfect. It&#x27;s a really light, clean scent. Really fresh floral notes. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, probably around three hours. After three, it&#x27;s more of a lingering glimpse of a scent rather than a fullbodied one. Great for summer when you don&#x27;t want anything too heavy.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It was recieved quickly and in perfect condition.  So sad it is now discontinued.  But thrilled to have ordered 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> I got lucky and bought this at a discount store. I have used other high end fragrance but my stepmom will still complain that I smell like smoke. I sprayed myself with this stuff and many hours later my stepmom who hates my usual smoe smell under fragrance told me she wanted whatever I was wearing! It smells wonderful! Please refer me to a fragrance like this one if there is one out there! This is discontinued!</li>
    <li> I have almost all of the Philosophy fragrances and am always checking for new ones.  Keep them coming.  I love the scents.</li>
    <li> I love this smell. It&#x27;s so light and clean. I wish they never discontinued it. Everytime I wear it, I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent--sophisticated, but not overpowering. It is my favorite Philosophy perfume. Just wish it had more staying power.</li>

I bought Eternal Grace based on reviews, and after the first whiff I immediately recognized the similarity to Versense (on my skin, at least). Oh, well.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give Philosphy&#x27;s new fragrance a shot, but this one just doesn&#x27;t measure up.

    <li> This fragrance smells great..I love it!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a \\&quot;5\\&quot; is because it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This was a quite a surprise . Thank Cosmetics Connection for the price reduction on my Eternal Grace fragrance spray.. I intend to keep you as my vendor in my beauty products ventures .</li>
    <li> This was a christmas gift for my wife. I could not get this in the local stores. Ordered it a week before christmas and it came on time.</li>
    <li> I am going to miss this fragrance.  They don&#x27;t make this anymore.  This is the second time my perfume has been discontinued</li>
    <li> I am so sad that Philosophy has discontinued this fragrance.  It is my absolute favorite of their line.  They are getting harder and harder to find online so I will make this one last.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for someone else.  They really liked it.  They had requested this fragrance because they have used it before.</li>
    <li> I love wearing my Eternal Grace.  Smelling it makes me feel very happy.  I would recommend it to any woman.</li>
    <li> So sad to see this fragrance discontinued by Philosophy, but happy to be able to still purchase on Amazon!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I usually wear original Burberry or Burberry London in the fall and/or as my evening perfumes. Eternal Grace is my FAVORITE summer/daytime perfume, and I am so disappointed that it is discontinued... It&#x27;s fresh, feminine, and still manages to keep some subtle &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; tones. LOVE this smell, especially with my body chemistry. It has great staying power (which I can&#x27;t really say about Burberry perfumes, but I love their scents)</li>
    <li> Eternal grace is my favorite philosophy fragrance. Don&#x27;t know why they took it out of the stores.</li>
    <li> I am the sort of girl who has never liked perfumes and often found them nauseating.  After receiving a sample of this before it was launched, I was immediately hooked.  It&#x27;s subtle and mellow.  I have had kids tell me I smell like \\&quot;the cookies that Grandma bakes me at Christmas,\\&quot; and have had adults tell me I simply smell divine.  This is one of the few scents that does not trigger a negative reaction for my sensitive skin or palate.  Just clean, simple, and happy!  I have noticed that people are nicer to me when I am wearing this than when I am not, seems to have a relaxing effect on those around you.  If you&#x27;ve always hated perfume, consider giving Philosophy a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as I can no longer find it elsewhere and is a particular favorite of mine.</li>
    <li> I buy this every year for my daughter because it is her favorite fragrence. The price is right and the shipment arrived quickly.  Best of all - this product is NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS.</li>
    <li> This fragrace is perfect!  It is light and feminine with a romantic edge.....no harsh or sharp fragrance.  It is my all time fav!  It is so hard to find anymore......thank goodness Amazon has some awesome vendors.  :)  I ordered this in two sizes.....was from two different vendors BUT they were GREAT!!!!  Product came SUPER fast and in awesome condition.  :)  :)  :)</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this fragrance.  I&#x27;m told I smell good.  I will continue to purchase it.</li>
