    <li> Great stuff and your skin feels so smooth and soft after use.</li>
    <li> You will love this body scrub! It is the perfect combination if minerals and delicate oil that leaves your skin soft and moisturized. No oily residue in the bath tub or on your skin. And the fragrance is so perfectly subtle that you will be able to wear your favorite perfume. This is my second jar of Deja Vu and I am making it part of my weekly routine.</li>
    <li> I first tried the body scrub at a mall kiosk. They put a little on my hand, massaged &amp; rinsed it and I was amazed at how smooth my hands were. The price here is cheaper than at the mall. I have dry, sensitive skin so I was a little nervous about using the body scrub but I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions. It moisturizes better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried and the green tea smell is absolutely WONDERFUL! The body scrub is an exfoliating scrub and it&#x27;s great for rough, cracked feet and in the winter it helps prevent chapped hands. When I have a special event and I&#x27;m wearing an outfit that shows my legs and arms, I give myself a special treat and use the scrub over my whole body so I wind up with glowing skin that smells great.</li>
    <li> Was eager to purchase products Containing dead sea minerals, but was very disappointed by the scrub - it is oily to a point where i felt greasy, and no better or effective than comparablr products found in drug stores,which are so much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Home spa here I come this stuff is amazing 👍🏾👍🏾👏🏾</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type of person who will spend endless hours or money on beauty products, especially because half the time I&#x27;m just too lazy to care but this is an exception to the rule. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect any kind of result when this was given to me as a gift but I gave it a go and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. The softness you get from weeks of applying lotion is accomplished in one scrub, I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the buy! My only complaint (and it may not be valid as the one I have is from ages ago--packaging may have changed!) is that it leaked fairly easily but even then, it&#x27;s still totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes your skin silky smooth! Nice scent! Don&#x27;t buy it at the malls because they charge $75!</li>
    <li> looked for remedy for eczema.. found it!!! this salt combined with lotion are amazing... no more itching!! will definitely continue to use..</li>
    <li> By far the best salt scrub I&#x27;ve tried. I first found this stuff in the mall but they were charging 4 times more than this.</li>
    <li> This product is terrific for the entire body. However, I used it on my face and it is a bit greasy. Great if you have dry skin!</li>
    <li> For an imitation product and for the price, it is the best one there.  Good for the body but I would recommend the dry scrub by dead sea spa.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Much cheaper than mall kiosks!  Makes skin feel so soft and clean. Exfoliates dry skin well - perfect for winter.</li>
    <li> First time using this product, really nice, will buy again/ also will recommend this body scrub to friends!  Thank you</li>
    <li> I tried this product at my daughter&#x27;s and loved it. I found it on Amazon for considerably less than she paid at the mall. It smells great. Feels great! and leaves my skin feeling clean, refreshed, and hydrated. It&#x27;s almost a min vacation every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Deja Vu Dead Sea Minerals Green Tea body scrub is simply AMAZING. I searched high and low for reasonably priced, high quality dead sea mineral body scrub and when I found this I fell in love. This scrub has a super subtle, fresh scent and did not irritate my sensitive skin.  This product will leave your skin feeling revitalized, soft and super moisturized. I would recommend this product to anyone. Stay beautiful!</li>
    <li> This stuff is oily but I love the smell and the price was reasonable. Better then buying in stores. love</li>
    <li> My skin feels luxurious after using green tea,it makes my skin sot and radiant</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect, because it exfoliates al the dead skin off your body!</li>
    <li> I like it. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing..and it was shipped fast...:)</li>
    <li> This product feels great. The fragrance is strong, but disappears quickly. My skin felt extremely smooth. I have keratosis and used this in between my coconut oil treatments</li>
    <li> I love the products, and did not know they were sold here. I just paid $120.00 for both the scrub and body butter at a mall kiosk. It was an educated impulse buy and now I am pissed off for not walking away. I have a good mind to return them. What a pain in the you know what what ( and in the wallet, too)&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.....</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Someone gave me this a few years ago and it was so good for my dry, cracked hands I never stopped using it. Absolute best thing I ever found to scrub away dead skin and moisturize completely. It even heals the cuts I get on my hands from paper and cardboard. This stuff is great and I hope everyone will try it and have the same experience.</li>
    <li> provides nice gritty feel as well as simultaneous moisturizer with fresh green tea smell and long lasting, would recommend it</li>
    <li> I will start off by saying I&#x27;d see these at little mall kiosks and, at the price they were selling for, I was beyond skeptical. There was no way any scrub was THAT good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my scrub today and just used it for the first time and I feel as if I just stepped out of a spa. My skin has never felt so soft!&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it on my hands, I thought it was going to be way too oily for me and I was disappointed. But, in fact, once I tried a full-body scrub it worked like a charm. I stepped out of the shower with the softest skin I&#x27;ve had in years. I even used it on the rough spots on my feet with great results! Though I would recommend sitting down to use it, otherwise you&#x27;ll be prone to falling on your face in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this, I say GO FOR IT!!! The reviewers on here have it spot on when they say this is an amazing product! I&#x27;m glad I listened to them, and you will be, too! :D</li>
    <li> Great seller delivered as expected,I will order from them again!***** Great product as expected.</li>
    <li> I LUV this stuff.  I got a chance to try it in a store on my hands and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth is made my hands.  It&#x27;s really wonderful and the price here at Amazon is unbeatable.  You will pay 3 times as much at a store.  Use it as a body wash and it will make your whole body &amp;#34;silky smooth!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love the scrub but the jar is filled to the top so the first dozen uses you will probably spill oil on the counter.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best Body Scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.  I sampled this during a presenation last year at the mall.  I love the moisture that it leaves on my body.  Making my skin so soft...</li>
    <li> My favorite...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product and bought as gifts for 6 years now.  It was great to find it at a more affordable price.</li>
    <li> Love this product and will continue to be using it for my delicate skin condition.  I has continued to meet with the highest expectations.</li>
    <li> exactly what is says it is...my feet and hands are super soft.  Greta in the bath tub too for an all over scrub.</li>
    <li> Bought this some time ago at the mall and loved it, but expensive.  Found on Amazon for 1/2 price and bought lots so I don&#x27;t run out !!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wayyy cheaper than what you pay at the mall kiosk and works just the same.  It has a slight scent but as a guy I did not mind too much.  Best to use before getting in shower and be smooth all over.</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is amazing!!!!  I used it for the first time and my skin was so hydrated and remained that way all day long.  This is now one of my skin care necessities.</li>
    <li> amazing product! smells great and made my skin super soft. i will definitely buy this again! thank you deja vu!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not 2 happy about the price doubling since the last couple of weeks i bought it.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin feeling moist but not greasy.  The scrub is stimulating without being irritating.  A little goes a long way and I really like the Green tea sent. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I originally discovered this product at a shopping mall kiosk. I paid over $45 for it and although I&lt;br /&gt;loved the product felt very guilty paying the price that I did. Then I saw it on Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is incredible! Using it makes my skin feel great!  I now purchase it for my friends and&lt;br /&gt;family- makes a great gift!</li>
