      <li>Not to mention the smell isn&#x27;t even a good one.</li>

      <li>This is an amazing face cleanser.  </li>
      <li>The Yes To Carrots products are amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of an old-lady floral perfume smell.</li>
      <li>Cleans well and great fresh scent, not overpowering!  </li>
      <li>The scent is interesting, kind of vanilla-y, not like carrots to my nose.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that it&#x27;s more effective at removing make up.</li>
      <li>But after using this once, the STRONG fragrance is lingering and giving me sinus congestion, sneezing, and sniffles!</li>
      <li>It does not take much of the product to get a nice lather on the face, so it is a great value.  </li>
      <li>Great for the first 2 days...</li>
      <li>I love the yes to products as a brand</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>but it also helped my face with breakouts (even more than the yes to tomatoes one)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t feel that it really impressed me enough to justify the cost of $8 for just 6 oz of cleanser.</li>
      <li>I love this brand immensely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I decided to say yes to carrots for life :)</li>
      <li>It gets the job done for most days.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s not objectionable.</li>
      <li>Make sure you rinse your face thoroughly though--you don&#x27;t want to leave any traces of it on your skin all day/night.</li>
      <li>I can tell my skin is softer and more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because I love this cleanser now.</li>
      <li>I can tell you for sure that it was this cleanser causing the peeling of skin whenever I put on my make-up.</li>
      <li>To me, it smells overwhelmingly like baby talc.  </li>
      <li>I love the creaminess of this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>well - when I use a cleansing cloth after I wash my face all of the foundation is gone, but most of my eye makeup is still on and smeared under my eyes</li>
      <li>I am going to buy so many more things i want to try from the</li>
      <li>To Carrots :)</li>
      <li>will update again soon :)</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>it needed to be healthy.</li>

      <li>My wife uses &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34; Tomato face wash, which is a bit more potent, and she uses the Yes</li>

      <li>that when they use something gentle (but effective!)</li>
      <li>and I certainly hope you get as good of luck as I am getting with this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Yes to Carrots facial cleanser in the past but have had difficulty finding it again.  Yah, thank you Amazon for having this product. I like it so much I purchased 2. I&#x27;ll be dead lone before I finish 2 containers.</li>
    <li> My face feels soft and I&#x27;ve noticed a bit more of a glow to my skin tone after using Yes To Carrots products. It has a great but not powerful smell and leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a natural foods grocery store and so I assumed it would be pretty simple and natural. But the scent is overpowering, and smells like cheap synthetic perfume. I&#x27;m going to return it tomorrow. Disappointed because I love trying new products and was excited about the look of this one.</li>
    <li> It cleans and softens your skin, but I&#x27;m not fond of the smell.  It slightly resembles that baby powder odor, which I detest.</li>
    <li> Did not like this at all - threw away</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! And it lasts FOREVER! I bought it in the beginning of June and have used it every night since, and it is still not empty! Feels so nice on your skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry or tight. It does have a strong smell, but I really like it.</li>
    <li> I really love the Say Yes to products.The Say Yes To carrots works wonders on my skin! If your looking for a product to restore your skins natural complexion, and to leave your skin feeling soft and fresh, then this products for you. Long lasting, exfoliating, moisturizing, an overall great product that I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone with dry damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this on a whim after reading some other reviews online. I usually use Clearasil, the non-medicated daily face wash, just to maintain my already (mostly) healthy skin. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about Clearasil was that it always left my face feeling dry. I would almost instantly have to put lotion on just to feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bottle of the Yes To Carrots cleanser and put some in my hands, I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t lather. I guess that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s 96% natural and doesn&#x27;t have those harsh chemicals that make the other face washes lather. And yes, it does have a scent, but it&#x27;s not perfume-y...it&#x27;s more like a mix of vegetables or something strange like that. I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s not objectionable. Anyway, I put it on my face, and right away I was pleasantly surprised. It felt good! I rubbed it in for a bit, then rinsed it off, as per the instructions. When I patted my face dry with a towel, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft my skin felt! It didn&#x27;t feel dry or tight at all! I actually had my boyfriend feel my face with his hand because I was so surprised. lol I didn&#x27;t even have to use my usual facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Yes to Carrots shampoo and conditioner, and I can&#x27;t wait to try them. Definitely give this cleanser a try, it&#x27;s worth the money, and I can already see that the bottle is going to last me for over a month, easily.</li>
    <li> This is a creamy milky cleanser that leaves the skin feeling hydrated and smooth. I wanted a non-drying cleanser to use with my Clarisonic brush. It isn&#x27;t a deep clean. It has a lotiony consistency and does not rinse well.  Drier skin may appreciate. I have normal/combo skin.</li>
    <li> I read the ingredient list before I bought it. I have no clue what I reacted to but in one week, my face looked like a strawberry &amp; felt like a dried up kiwi. I&#x27;m on a mission to find a good naturally based skin cleanser. Yes to carrots is scratched off my list.  Also, why is the fragrance so strong?</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve stated in previous posts regarding this line of products, I absolutely LOVE it! It&#x27;s definitely worth a try for anyone who suffers from sensitive/dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face wash for about a year now, and I plan to keep using it for years to come.  I&#x27;m a young male adult with no significant acne issues anymore (thank goodness), and other face washes leave my face feeling to dry and crackly, whereas I feel as if I&#x27;ve used a tiny bit of moisturizer on my skin after washing with this.  One tube of this lasts me several months, so it ends up being very affordable.  My wife uses &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34; Tomato face wash, which is a bit more potent, and she uses the Yes To Carrots nightly face cream.  We use the Yes To Carrots body wash.  Overall, we are pleased with the &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34; brand, and this is the product that got us started on them.</li>
    <li> Great for the first 2 days...</li>
    <li> I love the yes to products as a brand and I especially love the yes to carrots brand specifically.  So I picked this up at the drugstore because I liked that it was a product that leaned more on the natural side with no parabens and no testing on animals.  The Yes to Carrots brand is specifically made for normal to dry skin while I personally have oily skin; maybe that&#x27;s why I felt like this was more of a moisturizer as opposed to a cleanser. The product is very gentle though and I would recommend it for someone with dry skin but not for oily skin.  Because of its moisturizing properties I use this after my cleanser and after I exfoliate to add a refreshing effect right before I put on my actual moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser at Target, not Amazon. This left my face very clean and feeling refreshed. It only takes a small amount, so it is inexpensive to use. I love using natural products without a bunch of nasty unhealthy chemicals that do nothing for skin.</li>
    <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Yes To lines, I was really disappointed that this made my skin break out.  The scent is interesting, kind of vanilla-y, not like carrots to my nose.  The texture was nice and it was easy to rinse, it just wasn&#x27;t the right wash for me.  I was looking for a replacement for the Garnier Fructis Moisture Rescue creme face wash, that was a little more earth-friendly, but I went back to that because it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is wonderfully creamy, very rich and luxurious but without being overkill/too moisturizing. A little goes a long way. It left my face feeling soft, hydrated and very clean. It even took off mascara! (No stinging eyes either). This is a great product. It&#x27;s paraben free, made of natural antioxidant-rich ingredients and the company doesn&#x27;t test on animals. A total win for all!</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser! It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin; which is great considering that I have eczema. It only takes a little to go a long way. I also got this $3 cheaper from Amazon than my local stores. Yay!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam which I didn&#x27;t like but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. I tried it at my friend&#x27;s house and had to buy it. Couldn&#x27;t find it at my local Target so I ordered from Amazon.  The cleanser wipes away makeup easily and is not overly drying.  I no longer have to use an eye makeup remover, I simply use this instead. I love the scent (even though so people complained about it) and a pea-sized amount does the trick.</li>
    <li> Cant get a better face wash than this!</li>
    <li> Seems to calm my acne outbreaks a little but smells too much like a baby product for me.  I&#x27;ll try something else next time but I will keep this in mind.</li>
    <li> Ok, well honestly I have to say after trying it for a couple months I did find (like other reviews mentioned) that there seemed to be a layer of it left on my skin that began to peel off whenever I started to put on my make-up. Be careful to watch for such issues. I did make sure it was nothing else, like my moisturizer first. I changed my moisturizer back to the Mary Kay one I used for years before trying to save some money yet be all natural. I can tell you for sure that it was this cleanser causing the peeling of skin whenever I put on my make-up. Understand that if you take a chance on this that you may lose the cost if it does the same thing or worse to you. I knew I was taking a chance and was accepting the fact that I may lose money. Compared to the cost of a Mary Kay cleanser or some other well known yet quality brand I say try it if you want because you&#x27;ll still save money in the long run when you do find an inexpensive more natural alternative.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! However, the bottle I ordered came with a slit in the top, I received a refund very fast for the issue.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, prone to eczema and acne -- a really tough combination. The acne scars, while the eczema forces me to switch product lines every four months, once my skin can&#x27;t tolerate the ingredients anymore. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Neutrogena to Clinique, ProActiv and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing seems to work as well as Yes for Carrots Daily Facial Cleanser has. It&#x27;s what I like to call \\&quot;The Enforcer\\&quot;. If a pimple begins flaring up, Yes to Carrots (at least for my skin anyway) begins to make it go away, quickly and quietly, so it doesn&#x27;t balloon to Shrek-size proportions. And without scarring! It hasn&#x27;t handled the eczema as well. But, it usually flares up when I stop using Yes for Carrots. But, as far as acne control, this stuff works better than any commercial product I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper for me. In fact, I&#x27;m running out, so next weekend, I&#x27;m getting more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the smell -- which tends to linger long after you use the product...mostly smells like carrots and sweet potatoes. But I still recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water(Aqua), Sodium Coco Sulfate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf*, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Cellulose Gum, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract,  Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Extract, Silt (Dead Sea). Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ipomoma Batatas Tuber (Sweet Potato) Extract, Camelia Sinesis (Green Tea Extract); Spirulina Maxima Extract, Honey Extract*, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*. Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed oil*, Citrus Aurantium Fruit Extract*, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Xanthum Gun, Alcohol (Naturally Derived) Propanediol, Fragrance (Parfum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Certified Organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Paraben and Cruelty Free.</li>
    <li> Feels nice at first, by after a couple of days using it, my face got really dry. Now I use two timse a week at most and then it seems okay.</li>
    <li> This facial product is good for my face (dry) but maybe I expect to much wonders, because i have spots that won&#x27;t disappear (maybe a spot wonde, i&#x27;l be searching). It won&#x27;t dry my face that&#x27;s a plus and also it doesn;t irritate my face. I&#x27;ll still use it because it easy to aplied and to wash your face.</li>
    <li> I was pretty headstrong about using my Clinique facial cleanser. However, I found a Yes to Tomatoes product at Walgreens on sale and decided to try it. I loved it so decided to try this. I am in love with this! It smells amazing and makes my skin SUPER soft. Definitely will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I have problems with breakouts so was nervous about using a new product at first, but I love it! Great texture and only a small amount is needed. Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my skin had been clear with no over drying (another problem I&#x27;ve always had). Will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> Really like the Yes to line of products and have tried a couple different face cleansers. This is my favorite out of them all. Leaves my face smooth and moisturized. Washes makeup off very well. It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product to use daily without worrying about it drying out your face.</li>
    <li> I am so grateful that my sister told me about this cleanser, after discovering it in her bathroom. I use this product right after a scrub. I was very surprised at how refreshing and super soft it left my skin. I do have a very sensitive combination oily on the T-Zone skin type -so initially I was a bit hesitant about acne. I found that it does not dry your skin like some high-end cleansers do. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it&#x27;s more effective at removing make up. And the smell it&#x27;s not harsh i also can feel the antioxidants working right away.  I keep this product in my shower that I can get the most benefit from it. And I don&#x27;t use a whole lot; just use one tiny drop for my face and neck I don&#x27;t use too much. This cleanser is so reasonably priced compared to the other cleansers I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m definitely not changing.</li>
    <li> Love all the &amp;#34;yes To &amp;#34; products i have tried. Cleans well and great fresh scent, not overpowering!  Extra bonus perk: Cruelty Free Company&amp;#34; , which is all i will buy.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser.  It does not take much of the product to get a nice lather on the face, so it is a great value.  My skin did not feel dry after washing my face like it has with so many other facial products I have tried before.  I also like that this product has so many natural ingredients and is free of SLS (which I tend to get an allergic reaction to).</li>
    <li> love the texture! Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I always use to wash my face with cleansing clear products. However, I decided to switch over to all natural products with no animal testing and found this product to be amazing. I use to experience loads of breakouts and had an extremely oily face (naturally have oily skin) and after using this there were a minimum of two breakouts a month on my face (as opposed to several times a month). It keeps my skin feeling smooth and gives it a vibrant look. Love it! I decided to say yes to carrots for life :)</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and just discovered Yes to Carrots brand, they work great at keeping my skin clear and soft</li>
    <li> I love this face cleaner. I had been using the lotion for about a year and really liked that so finally decided to try the cleaner. My sensitive skin is clear and hydrated with the combo of the cleaner and lotion.</li>
    <li> I had to give this one up after I used it for a few weeks.  I kept hoping that maybe I would just get used to it.  I always wash my eye makeup off at the same time I wash my face and this removes eye makeup just fine.  It just always burns my eyes a little and it was too irritating to keep using.  My other half used it a few times and he said it didn&#x27;t bother him.  I do have sensitive eyeballs due to lasik, but I have used several other brands with no issues.</li>
    <li> I had been happily using Burt&#x27;s Bees cleansers, but wanted to try this one based on rave reviews from YouTube and Amazon.  I believe this product might be fine for people who have issues with oil.  I do not, and this cleanser made my skin feel dry both times I used it.  Additionally, I think the fragrance is very off putting.  To me, it smells overwhelmingly like baby talc.  I have since gone back to Burt&#x27;s Bees and have no immediate plans to change that.</li>
    <li> I like how smooth-feeling this cleaner is. I have been using it for the past month and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing face cleanser.  It smells so good and makes your skin feel soft after using it.  I&#x27;ve actually had better success with this on my skin&#x27;s clarity than the products with Salicylic acid or Benzoyl Peroxide.  It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin - pair it with the yes to carrots moisturizer or even Cetaphil moisturizer for soft, clear skin.  Seriously, try this stuff - Everyone who I&#x27;ve ever made use it has immediately bought it and loved it too!</li>
    <li> I think this product is incredible. My daughter uses this product every day/ night and her skin glows. She has very sensitive skin, and Yes to Carrots facial cleanser is really a fantastic thing to have now matter how sensitive your skin is. She is very happy with the way her skin looks and is proud. I really suggest that you buy this product.</li>
    <li> Great face wash, keeps skin hydrated. This one is NOT fragrance free. I would recommend the fragrance free one. This has a very chemical smell, which makes me feel it is not good for skin.&lt;br /&gt;All said, it is great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it after a wash.</li>
    <li> The Yes to Carrots is really soft on  your skin, paraben free, and a little goes a long way. It does have a fresh aloe vera type smell to it, but I like it. I used to use Skin ID and Neutrogena products, but this leaves my skin looking and feeling softer. FYI: I have combination skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Oct 2017: I STILL use this product and its one of my HOLY GRAILS. It&#x27;s one of the longest relationships I&#x27;ve had in my life lol. Great for the winter as it doesn&#x27;t overdry the.</li>
    <li> I bought the Yes To Carrots cleanser a few days ago, I&#x27;ve used it 3 nights in a row and already I&#x27;ve noticed: NO new breakouts! I have combination skin, and its really sensitive ( I got a face sun screen last year that said it was \\&quot;natural\\&quot; that gave me a rash all over my face so I have to be careful) So far I&#x27;ve been alternating the Yes to Tomatoes wipes in the morning just to get rid of the oil I wake up with, and then at night I switch to the Yes to Carrots cleanser. My skin has never felt softer and I&#x27;ve never seen acne (adult) disappear so fast! The black heads as lessening and the rest is just healing right up. My husband even noticed a difference. So now I&#x27;m looking into which moisturizer I want to try from the Yes To line, trying to keep my combination skin to semi normal levels. My mom and sister insisted that this brand was wonderful and now I&#x27;m a believer! I will update after a bit more time has passed but i normally have a reaction by now if its not going to work :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week in: turely this is the best my skin has looked in years! My acne is clearing up, my skin feels soft and smooth and the dry patches are almost gone (just from this cleanser!) I am going to buy so many more things i want to try from the Yes To brand just so i can finally take care of my face the way it should be. will update again soon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Month in: Skin is clear, I&#x27;ve had minor breakouts but we are talking like one at a time vs five-six. I used to have really oily spots on my face along with really dry flaky areas and now I don&#x27;t have either. This face was has saved my face! I really like how smooth it is, its like washing your face with lotion. I follow up this product with the Yes To Tomatoes lotion, but really I would recommend any of their products based on the type of skin you have. Yes To Carrots is Amazing!</li>
    <li> I love the creaminess of this product. It does the job quickly , smells great and lasts an unbelievably long time.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser, have been using it for years.  Doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes and is very soft and gentle to the skin. One tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this brand immensely.&lt;br /&gt;I felt the cream cleanser did a pretty good job in actually ridding my face of dirt &amp; impurities.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it leaves a dryness I can&#x27;t deal with.</li>
    <li> Feels great and I love the smell!  Even when some rinses and you can get that little taste in your mouth it doesn&#x27;t even phase me.  Haven&#x27;t gotten any in my eyes, but I can&#x27;t imagine it would be too bad.  It makes your face feel clean and refreshed and the smell just makes me want to use it again.  My boyfriend even really likes it!  I have also tried the yes to tomatoes and didn&#x27;t care for that one.  I will definitely be sticking to this brand and going to get the lotion as well.  Fantastic product for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I like this product and will buy again, but I&#x27;m not convinced it is really cleaning my face as deeply as I would like</li>
    <li> Love this facial cleanser, I have pretty sensitive skin with both dryness and oiliness. This works to keep my skin clean without irritating it and also moisturizes.</li>
    <li> This Yes to Carrots facial cleanser has a lotion-like consistency and is gentle on the skin. However, I did not like the smell. Its smells like baby powder when one would expect it to smell like carrots. Its also white in color. I decided to return this simply for the fact that it felt like rubbing baby-scented Cortisone cream on my face. Also, I didn&#x27;t feel that it really impressed me enough to justify the cost of $8 for just 6 oz of cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love the yes to carrots line in general because of how it keeps my dry skin moisturized, and this cream cleanser is no exception. It has a luxurious texture and leaves my face feeling smooth and clean but still soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can feel a bit heavy if you&#x27;re not used to it, but once you adjust you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
    <li> Works so well with my Clairsonic!  I have rosacea and this cleanser is incredibly gentle and moisturizing.  I wash my face twice a day and this does a great job of removing makeup, including mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying the cleanser, I picked up the body butter-OMG it&#x27;s the bomb!  I have cracked looking skin on my shins where my skin is dry and other butters/tubs of cream helped keep me comfortably moist, but never changed the appearance of the dessert looking skin despite using them almost daily.  Within 2 weeks of using the body butter, it was completely normal looking.  Because of that I got everything in the skincare line.  I love the body lotion, the night cream, and the mask.  Didn&#x27;t care for daytime moisturizer (with spf) as it feels like sunscreen and is glossy on my skin, the daytime moisturizer (without spf) is just ok, and the eye cream is useless.</li>
    <li> Strong scent, but all in all it does the job without over drying the face. Works with my acne prone sensitive skin as well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful wonderful product.  Not harsh just what oily skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping as promised.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel good, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Very pleasant scent, not overpowering like some facial cleansers. Like the fact that it is an organic product and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the petrolium additives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product has so many positive reviews.  It is VERY drying.  I have dry skin but this stuff makes me feel like my skin is being stretched and it is uncomfortable.  I am serious when I say I can use bar soap and my face will feel better. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Crazy, thick, great coverage. Not watered down. Feels rich.</li>
    <li> You know the constant battle...You need a product that cleans and exfoliates, but isn&#x27;t super harsh on your skin and make you dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far my favorite facial cleanser. I put about a pea size dab on my finger and spread it throughout my face in the shower. I leave it on for about 2 minutes, then rinse it off. Follow it up with a moisturizer and I feel cleaner, smoother, and softer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Also love the bulk online size, much better than the small Walgreens bottle :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is doing a whole lot for my adult acne, but I have pretty sensitive skin and it&#x27;s nice and gentle.  My skin feels clean after I use it and a little dab of the soap goes a long way so a bottle lasts!</li>
    <li> SOME BACKGROUND / THE PROBLEM: Like most people, I have switched facial cleansers on a regular basis over the years looking for that perfect fit for my skin. My skin is sensitive and tends to be on the dry side. I rarely have blemishes or pimples, but blackheads have been a constant issue for my skin. For years, I stopped using facial make-up on a regular basis and used facial cleansing products that boasted exfoliating properties (the kind with small beads, etc. in them) but STILL blackheads and slightly rough skin plagued my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a few months ago I went for a facial at a local spa, and the Esthetician told me I was actually over-exfoliating my skin! It turns out my constant use of harsh, low quality \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; facial cleansers was depriving my skin of the natural oils and top layer of skin it needed to be healthy. The result? My skin was actually retaining everything it could in an effort to stay moisturized. In short: naturally dying skin cells on my face were being retained and turning into blackheads over time... yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SOLUTION: The Esthetician recommended using a natural, cream facial cleanser in my daily routine. She said this would keep my skin clean on a daily basis but would not be harsh enough to strip away the oils and top layer that my face needed to be healthy. Then she recommended a gentle, enzyme facial exfoliant, to be used once a week just to help my skin get rid of any unnecessary oils or dead skin that had accumulated throughout the week. After reading reviews and ingredient lists (I wanted a natural product) I decided to try Yes To Carrots Daily Cream Facial Cleanser and... I am hooked. My skin not only feels soft and looks wonderful, but I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments and double-takes from complete strangers. I am NOT kidding - it&#x27;s become a regular thing for me to hear \\&quot;you&#x27;re skin is just glowing\\&quot; from perfect strangers. You can&#x27;t beat that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE: I now use this product every time I wash my face, followed by a light, oil-free facial moisturizer. Once a week I exfoliate using an enzyme facial exfoliant recommended by the Esthetician. My face has never been more clear, healthy, consistent and glowing. THANK YOU Yes To Carrots :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO THOSE WHO SAY THIS PRODUCTS DOESN&#x27;T CLEANSE: I have read some reviews that people using this product felt like they were just rubbing lotion on their face and not experiencing any real cleansing. Yes, the consistency of this product is creamy (though certainly not as creamy as lotion) but there is no question that it is cleansing your skin. Unfortunately, I think so many people use harsh, poor-quality facial cleansers which dry out skin, that when they use something gentle (but effective!) like Yes To Carrots they think it&#x27;s not working or cleaning properly because they don&#x27;t feel that burning or stripping of skin cells. Stop hurting your skin! Be gentle! Be natural! Trust in this product and all of it&#x27;s creaminess, and it will give you great results, seriously.</li>
    <li> Not my first tube of Carrots cleanser.  Only difference is the first was unscented.  Not crazy about the scent but it still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing cleanser. Really makes my face feel hydrated and clean.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely moody and prone to weird rashes and redness even just from showering.  I have to be very selective about personal care products and love the Yes to Cucumbers line.  Recently my skin has been dry and I love the creamy luxurious free of this new cleanser.  It is gentle and nourishing for my sensitive skin.  My face looks and feels much better!</li>
    <li> My skin had to get used to this. I&#x27;m 20, have mild acne, with combination skin, and live in a very dry climate. When I first started using this cleanser, my face broke out BAD. I had tons of tiny, tiny little red zits all over my forehead, where there actually used to be none. But the cleanser was more expensive than I was used to, and there was a lot of it left, so I stuck with it. I&#x27;m glad I did, because I love this cleanser now. My skin cleared up, and I think it&#x27;s actually healthier than it was before. I can actually use this cleanser and skip the moisturizer, and be completely fine--my skin won&#x27;t feel tight or dry, and it won&#x27;t flake. Make sure you rinse your face thoroughly though--you don&#x27;t want to leave any traces of it on your skin all day/night. The smell was distracting at first. It&#x27;s kind of an old-lady floral perfume smell. But apparently I got used to it after a week or two, because it doesn&#x27;t distract me at all anymore, and nobody else I&#x27;ve asked say they notice any particular smell. You also only need to use a pea-size amount for every wash, so it&#x27;s going to last me a WHILE. I think I&#x27;ll get this again, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This brand is great for my face!!! I recently tried their yes to tomatoes cream, it gave decent results but this one struck me. My face is the type that can&#x27;t make up its mind. If I get a product to help fight acne it gets dry, if I get a product to help with dryness it breaks out.&lt;br /&gt;This product not only helped my face get smoother due to its dryness but it also helped my face with breakouts (even more than the yes to tomatoes one) unlike I was expecting.  I haven&#x27;t even used the whole bottle yet and I&#x27;m already at the point where I&#x27;m ok without wearing makeup in public. I hope this was helpful and I certainly hope you get as good of luck as I am getting with this.</li>
    <li> I expect the product to smell different, more natural... It still smells good though! Creamy, thick consistency, and does the job. The only drawback is that I have to squeeze the tube quite hard to get the product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: SUPER difficult to get the product out! I need two hands to squeeze the tube.</li>
    <li> I want to like Yes to Carrots. This product smells heavenly and is wonderful to apply. But I find that it dries my face very much.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this is perfect. Leaves my skin feeling so soft and natural. No heavy smell and I love that its mostly natural. I also recomend Yes To Carrots over night cream! These two products will always be on my shelf....... Oh, and the Yes To Grapefruits wipes are amazing as well.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this, but I think it actually dries out my face. It&#x27;s great as a cleanser though, haven&#x27;t had any acne since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does a great job of removing all my makeup and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. I can tell my skin is softer and more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is very peculiar. It smells like my grandmother&#x27;s perfume exploded on my face. And it lingers throughout the day. I would buy more of these products but that smell is a bit too much to handle.</li>
    <li> very good cleanser, gentle for sensitive skin, and natural!</li>
    <li> This product is very creamy and luxurious.  I keep one in the shower and one by the sink.  It cleans exceptionally and leaves my skin soft and subtle.  I would not use however if you have oily skin.  Great for all other skin types.</li>
    <li> A nice creamy cleanser, works well on my older sensitive skin. Will probably try this one again and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> My wife and I used to use Neutrogena products and then we found the Yes To line. My wife has oily skin and I have normal skin. This cleanser works well for us both. It cleans deeply without irritating. It removes my wife&#x27;s makeup (including waterproof mascara) without issue. Smells clean - not like carrots. It is a white cleansing lotion - not orange.</li>
    <li> My acne has literally disappeared since using this product (mild, mind you). Does not over dry or leave oily or waxy film at all. Have gone through 2 bottles now. In love with the body and hand lotion too!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It is very rich and creamy. As long as you use enough water it will sud up for you. Leaves no residue and no tight feeling. Perfect combination to wash and hydrate. There is a scent to it, which does smell perfumey which may be too much for some people, didn&#x27;t bother me. I have not had any breakouts while using this product either! This product works wonders for helping with the dryness. I haven&#x27;t had any peeling whatsoever! Also, I had this product in the shower with me, didn&#x27;t have any shaving cream, used this.....MAGICAL! Works awesome for shaving! Super smooth and hydrated skin.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and does not dry the skin!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is up with not getting the same product that is pictured, but the bottle I got is different. I ordered it based off of reviews and the ingredient list, because I liked a lot of ingredients that were listed on the second picture.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I got a bottle that only has a few of those ingredients, and on the front, instead of saying &amp;#34;Yes to organic carrots&amp;#34; it just says &amp;#34;Yes to carrots&amp;#34;. The one I received also says 95% natural rather than the 96% that is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients of the one I got:&lt;br /&gt;Water (aqua), glycerin, disodium cocoamphodipropionate, stearic acid, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, hydrogenated castor oil, phenoxyethanol, daucus carota sativa (carrot) seed oil*, cucurbita pepo (pumpkin) fruit extract, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, fragrance (parfum), ethylhexyl stearate, xanthan gum, potassium sorbate.&lt;br /&gt;*certified organic ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGE difference. Fragrance is no longer the last ingredient, and there&#x27;s way less extracts of food, moisturizing ingredients, and whatnot.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the way it cleans my face and leaves it feeling smooth and not tight.</li>
    <li> Really like this cleaner.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my, 45 year old, face dry.  Just clean and refreshed.  With none of the nasty stuff that I don&#x27;t want on my skin. Much cheaper here than local Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for about a year now and I really like it. It&#x27;s not too drying and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. Very mild scent (not really noticeable at all). I use a lot of the Yes To products and this is another winner!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually mind scents, and I definitely don&#x27;t react to them. But after using this once, the STRONG fragrance is lingering and giving me sinus congestion, sneezing, and sniffles! (I don&#x27;t even have allergies, and I&#x27;ve never had this type of reaction to a product.) Not to mention the smell isn&#x27;t even a good one. In addition, my skin was dry after the first use, definitely not hydrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d reccomend this cleanser.  It is thick and creamy.</li>
    <li> I guess it depends on what you are looking for in a cleanser but I really didn&#x27;t like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;All natural&lt;br /&gt;Probably good for sensitive skin (I don&#x27;t know - my skin in not sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t lather AT ALL - feels like rubbing lotion on your face in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts - I use it once or twice a day and I hardly ever get acne but I haven&#x27;t had completely clear skin since I started using this (was using L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift before)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup well - when I use a cleansing cloth after I wash my face all of the foundation is gone, but most of my eye makeup is still on and smeared under my eyes</li>
    <li> Its a great moisturizer and not watery that it runs off you. I like to use it every time i shower because it&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly. Smells great and the aloe vera is soothing after being battered by the sun or long day on the job lol.  It does better than most products I buy in stores and it cost less than most if them. Overall a great product. Very refreshing on your face and you can feel the difference from traditional soaps and other products and the kids dont mind a squirt or two  after a day at the beach. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I really struggle with dry skin and this facial cleanser has been GREAT!  I use it with the &amp;#34;yes to cucumbers&amp;#34; lotion.  Fantastic combo.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin very soft and smells nice but not overpowering. It&#x27;s not a strong product so if you&#x27;re looking for something that cuts through grease/oil, this is not it. This is what I would consider a moderate cleanser rather than mild. It gets the job done for most days. On days when I&#x27;m particularly gross, I use a scrub</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I much prefer my St. Ives apricot scrub to this. I didn&#x27;t feel like this was amazing. It was good and would work in a pinch but wouldn&#x27;t become a staple of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Great Product! The only thing I can use and my skin don&#x27;t get irritated or dryed out! Finally Have Clear skin again!</li>
    <li> very moisturizing. the natural alternative to neutrogena&#x27;s cream cleanser.</li>
    <li> so far so good!  4 stars so far as I&#x27;m only 1/2 way through the tube; however I&#x27;ve experienced no redness, flair ups since using it to date.  42yr old woman, fair &amp; sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works good... no chemicals.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> The Yes To Carrots products are amazing. I have never had a product work so gently and thoroughly on my sensitive skin before. It keeps my skin soft and smooth as well as helps blemishes to disappear more quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a Shoppers Drug Mart rather than on Amazon to avoid shipping and customs fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the Yes To Tomatoes facial cleanser, the tube is rather small for the price you pay. Unlike the Tomatoes version, this product claims to be scentless when in reality it does indeed smell and the odor is an odd one at that. Sometimes it smells like &#x27;used&#x27; baby powder, when at other times it smells pleasant and almost marshmallow like. This was quite questionable to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The version I got of this product also claimed to exfoliate the skin when it actually seemed to clog it. However, despite this, I still had clear, soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless I would not recommend this product to anyone but I would suggest the Yes To Tomatoes version.</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser every evening. It makes my face feel refreshed, clean, and soft. I like this cleanser not so much as for what it does but for what it doesn&#x27;t do. I have very acne prone skin and this cleanser has never made me break out. It has never made my skin feel overly dry or oily. It seems to be \\&quot;just right\\&quot; for getting the cleansing job done. I like that it is a cream cleanser instead of foam or powder/grainy-like. It is also relatively inexpensive and great quality for the price.</li>
