<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These fit the top of my 32 fl ounce Tresemme&#x27; bottles.  The center tubes of each only needed to be cut off at the bottom by about an inch or so which was easily handled with a pair of scissors.  This is a godsend given that Tresemme&#x27; no longer is putting pump tops on their 32 ounce bottles!  I highly recommend these.  Service was quick.  Would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> These are so convenient to use with the Pureology 33oz. bottles of shampoo. No more handling the large containers with your slippery hands in the shower. Just pump out the correct amount of product for great looking hair.</li>
    <li> Item as described, works in Aveda 1l bottles bought for.</li>
    <li> I needed this to replace the horrid pumps that Philosophy puts in their products. Why they continue to use one that break constantly is beyond me, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy their version of a replacement pump either, so I bought this for a 33.5 oz bottle of lotion and it works great.</li>
    <li> Just perfect! Large container of shampoo and conditioner sit on the shelf in the shower and are easy to use.  Pumps just the right amount.  Shampoo is concentrated so I don&#x27;t like getting too much.</li>
    <li> Love these and work great for my 33.8 oz Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner. Much easier to dispense!</li>
    <li> Received one white pump, fits a 33oz One N  only Aragan aragan oil shampoo and conditioner , bought another for the conditioner</li>
    <li> My hair is a little past my shoulders. At first it seemed like this pump was dispensing too little shampoo and conditioner, but really it&#x27;s a good amount. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m saving money with this versus pouring shampoo into my hand and estimating the amount.</li>
    <li> I used these pumps for my Redken 1 L shampoo + 1 L conditioner bottles. Fits perfectly, pumps out the perfect amount and I have two extra pumps to spare!</li>
    <li> This works great with my bottles so I can limit the amount of product used, no issues, and well worth it</li>
    <li> This pump stem was long enough for the Redken bottle I use.  Works perfectly! Worth the price because you save money using a pump instead of pouring the shampoo/conditioner in your hand.</li>
    <li> Good fit for my shampoo bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of pumps before, but can&#x27;t get these to work.  I&#x27;ve tried twisting, pushing while twisting, squeezing while twisting . . .no instructions included.  Maybe there is some secret.  It fits on the bottle, but I can&#x27;t get the pump part to pop up and work.  So far, useless.</li>
    <li> One pump inoperable. Not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were supposed to fit a 1.0 L Listerine bottle. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t - far from it. They look sturdy enough and I&#x27;d give it more stars, but it just did not fit its purpose.</li>
    <li> Nice pumps. I bought two of them. They work well for my huge bottles of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> The pimp works very well. Not cheap quality.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s only one pump in the package. so I ordered another one, it fits perfect with Nioxin bottle.</li>
    <li> The pumps arrived packaged nice and small... the color did not appear as in photo;( They&#x27;re more of a pearl beige color, not at all white. They still seem to function so I think I can be happy despite the misrepresentation.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the 1 liter shampoo/conditioner bottles.</li>
    <li> Worked GREAT in my ENJOY shampoo/conditioner bottles!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good pump, I rigged it up to put into a mouthwash bottle that it didn&#x27;t fit into. I was so excited when I saw 1 Liter in the name and bought it on impulse! My excitement led me to believe that all 1 Liter bottles had the same mouth sizes... I thought I read reviews saying that it fit Listerine bottles, but those reviews were nowhere to be found! Oh well, I had a good laugh from my mistake! It&#x27;s a great pump, nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Excellent Products.&lt;br /&gt;To fit the 33oz bottle had to be measured and to clip slightly,the product works as tailor made</li>
    <li> These pumps fit perfectly on the classic Paul Mitchell 1 liter bottles.  Wish they were sold in a 2 pack, but I guess I&#x27;ll just save the extras for future use.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  I hated picking up my heavy salon style shampoo and conditioner, now I pump the product out and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace broken pump dispenser on Bed Head shampoo 25.36 oz. size.  It works fine, but fortunately I saved the bottle stem from the broken item because the stem on this one was too short to reach the bottom of the bottle.  I was able to thread it into the pump mechanism without difficulty.</li>
    <li> not much to hype these up...lol..  they are just pumps for bottles.  I did like that they were CHEAP and came in the mail fast.</li>
    <li> I bought these pumps for some phyto organics shampoo I ordered on the same day.  I placed the order on Friday night.  I recieved the pumps on Tuesday.  Arrived as expected but turns out I didn&#x27;t need them after all so I gave them to my sister.  :)</li>
    <li> There was absolutely nothing wrong with the pump for the 33.8 oz bottle except that it didn&#x27;t fit AT ALL.  It just sat on top of the place where it should have gone. I bought it to fit on a 33.8 bottle of mouthwash, but it didn&#x27;t.  It didn&#x27;t cost that much, but it was money wasted.  I don&#x27;t want to take the chance of buying another one because it may not fit either.</li>
    <li> It fits perfectly to my invati one litre bottle BUT it leaks during summer and discoloured! What a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Thought I was ordering a red pump so I could differentiate my shampoo vs. Conditioner.  It arrived white.  The picture did not match the description.</li>
    <li> Works great on Regis liter bottles and shipping was fast. Would recommend to anyone with liter bottles for shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> The pumps did not reach to the bottom so it made it hard to reach the remainder of shampoo and conditioner. The reason I bought the pumps was to be able to reach farther down towards the bottom of the containers for the shampoo and conditioner. No problem with the mechanical part of the pumps.</li>
    <li> Although mine arrived and were black in color vice the white shown in the photo... They worked great in my 1-liter bottles of Redken Blonde Glam shampoo and conditioner.  The pumps themselves are a little stiff and should be put on a sturdy surface (I had mine in a floor-to-ceiling pole-style shower rack, and had to transfer to the floor of the shower because they were bending my rack) but they work great, and pump out just the right amount of product for my longer hair.  Shipping was fast (I live in Virginia), and for the price you really can&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
    <li> Works fine and fits in my Matrix Biology 33.8oz bottle without problems. I&#x27;m pretty sure it gets to the bottom, but I held on to the original cap just in case. This came in all white though, hence a -1 star</li>
    <li> These came really fast and worked great in my bottles.</li>
    <li> Worked great!  Very happy with this pump!</li>
    <li> This product is just great, perfect fit, enough product everytime I pump for shampoo and conditioner.  No wasted product and now I can use it way down to the last drop.</li>
    <li> Great little pumps for shampoo &amp; conditioner. They fit perfectly on my Pureology 33.8oz bottles. The straws aren&#x27;t too short, they reach the bottom of the bottles. Had them for a few weeks and loving them already.</li>
    <li> I started using Nioxin products a while back and just bought it in liter bottles.  The bottles were cumbersome to use, especially the conditioner that is so thick I had to store it upside down - a real nuisance.  I looked at many of the pumps here and was glad to see ones made by (for?) Nioxin liter botles.  But I was hesitant because of the many reviews that said they don&#x27;t fit.  One reviewer mentioned these pumps so I took a chance.  Hey, it was only three bucks for 2 pumps! What did I have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumps arrived two days after ordering, no shipping, no tax.  Gee, the shipping had to cost the vendor more than the product.  At first the pump did not work in the conditioner.  So before putting the second one in, I checked it in a sink full of water.  Worked fine.  Did the same with the first one and it worked fine too.  I put the first pump back in the conditioner bottle and after a few squirts of water, out came the conditioner.  Guess it just needed to be primed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t believe only three dollars.  This was quite the deal.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Bought these for Kerastase 1 Liter bottles and they fit perfectly. I was a bit skeptikal as Kerastase is not explicitly mentioned anywhere but they&#x27;re just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly in the smaller size TreSemme.  You may need to cut the tube, but if you don&#x27;t, it can be forced in and will still be long if you buy larger bottles of shampoo.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for 1 liter Matrix Biolage bottle</li>
    <li> I recently bought two of those giant sized shampoo and conditioner bottles at the salon but did not think about them not having a pump top so I went looking on Amazon and as always, there was just what I needed.  These are perfect.</li>
    <li> Fits my Nixon bottle perfectly!!! But only received one unlike other posted reviews. I&#x27;m debating if I should buy another one.</li>
    <li> I use these for my Redken All Soft liter bottles. One of them did seem to get stuck and my husband had to play with it for it to work the very first time. But, I have not had any problems since. It makes it so much easier to not have to tilt the conditioner over to really get it to come out.</li>
    <li> Great for use with pureology products in hte big containers as well as lanza reconstructor (which is super thick).</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the pump in the 32oz bottle of WEN cleansing conditioner. (I have a WEN gallon bottle and have use that to refill the 32oz bottle.) This replacement pump is great and works better than the original pump. It feels smoother and is easier to push down on to get the conditioner to come out.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my bottle of conditioner. I removed the screw cap and put this pump in. I did not need to cut it and it works perfectly. I prefer to pump what I use in the shower and many items do not have a pump. I don&#x27;t know anywhere else to buy one of these, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon. Of course the price was terrific too.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about a pump. It fits my conditioner bottle but not my shampoo bottle. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> Posting this for others because someone&#x27;s review mentioned that they got two in their shipment. This was not the case for me - I&#x27;ll have to buy another.</li>
    <li> WTF!  I am supposed to write a review for plastic pumps.  I punt.</li>
    <li> Great for my large bottle of shampoo.  I will order from this company again.  Sent quickly, price was great and product is sturdy.</li>
    <li> Did not fit in my Enjoy shampoo and conditioner bottles.  They should provide measurements or a brand listing of bottles these will fit.</li>
    <li> Material and fit were perfect.  Turns out I didn&#x27;t actually need them after I received an order for Shampoo and conditioner which already came with them attached.  Had I known, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered them.</li>
    <li> Glad to find a pump that fits my Priva 33oz size shampoo &amp; conditioner. Very affordable price and works great. Recommended!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my shampoo and conditioner.  Fits and works excellent.</li>
    <li> This is a must for large shampoo and conditioner bottles. I have used this pump on 3 different bottles. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> pretty good except I had to cut it down for it to fit.  I am not sure why that is the case but cutting it worked</li>
    <li> The two part assembly is a bit strange but its all working just as I expected. Good construction and I would make a guess that the disassembly will aid in cleaning!</li>
    <li> I buy these to replace the lame ones that come with some shampoo containers. They pump out a good amount of product. One pump for shampoo and conditioners is all it takes!</li>
    <li> Makes dispensing from the liter bottle much easier and helps control how much I&#x27;m using...no overuse anymore. Worth the few dollars.</li>
    <li> This makes washing my hair so much easier by not having to deal with those large bottles.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t screw  securely to the ISO shampoo liters that I have, but does the job none-the-less.  good price too!</li>
    <li> It works great, but the color was champagne gold, maybe some one would say... it is light brown. I did like the color!! But if you want to have it in white, you might want to contact the seller.</li>
    <li> These are very strong pumps.  They are Salon Quality so they are sturdy.  I can generally get about 1 to 2 years out of a pump before I have to replace it.  Especially this kind.</li>
    <li> A nice, sturdy, heavy-duty pump, but don&#x27;t make my mistake and not pay attention to the exact size of the bottle you need it to work with.  I casually thought, &amp;#34;Meh, it&#x27;s looks right.&amp;#34; Apparently 32 oz. bottles and 33.8 oz. bottles really do take different sized pumps.  Not sure l&#x27;ll ever have anything to use this on.  The straw length is quite long too, so I suspect that depending on the shape of your bottle, you may have to cut the thick plastic shorter.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, and fits my liter-size bottle of shampoo, as I needed.  Works fine--doesn&#x27;t leak, and hasn&#x27;t clogged yet.</li>
    <li> Note to any potential buyer - Although a lot of reviewers are stating they received a 2 pack, I only received 1. :-\  The color of cap is not black, instead gold.  I will not be buying another, and am shopping elsewhere (sorry Amazon) to get my black pumps.  Not worth the return hassle so eating the cost, but not out a lot, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I just started using this, but so far I really like it.  It really makes shower time more efficient for me!</li>
    <li> Did not fit the bottle as it claims but you can cut the bottom to size. Tops get stuck and are made in poor quality.</li>
    <li> Good price. So far it is durable</li>
    <li> Fit 33.8 oz Biolage bottle. Two white pumps were delivered new.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for my Bonacure shampoo and they worked perfectly. It&#x27;s exactly what I was needing and these pumps served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Works great with my Nioxin Conditioner, fits the bottle and pumps great. No complains</li>
    <li> This does not fit. It is to big and not worth your money. Don&#x27;t buy for keratin 34 oz shampoo or conitioner</li>
    <li> Works great.  (after someone else installed it - comes with no directions - and I can break anything)  You have to do something to the top before inserting it into the bottle.</li>
    <li> Bought these to go with my larger bottles of Pureology..they fit perfectly and are easy to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> Head is for small bottles only. Need to check the size of head before purchasing. I haven&#x27;t found any yet.</li>
    <li> The right size for my 1liter shampoo and conditioner bottles</li>
    <li> we have an open walk-in shower with limited space so I really wanted pump bottles - these pumps fit my shampoo and conditioner bottles perfectly - less mess and faster!</li>
    <li> Great and very useful.  Pumps the right amount of product with no waste.  Will certainly purchase again  when I need it</li>
    <li> Should have got the 2nd one as weel. I didnt think it came all by itself since I got the combo in the shompoo and conditioner . My own fault</li>
    <li> I had a little trouble getting the top to release to its full extent but it works just great. I use it for a 1-liter bottle of thick conditioner that is so thick, it&#x27;s hard to dispense through the tilt-cap. It comes trough the  pump very easily when I push down on it just once.</li>
    <li> Love the peachy color and convenience in the shower.  I can also control how much I get by how hard I press.  It came on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Good for large bottles</li>
    <li> The ones I got were A) two of them (not listed anywhere) and B) gold/copper in color rather than white/clear as the image suggests. Didn&#x27;t fit the bottle I&#x27;m using but I was only replacing a broken pump and it&#x27;s for personal use so I have no problem taping it to the neck of the bottle to keep it steady. Pump works like a dream, easy to unlock and hose is easy to trim. If it fits your bottle, you&#x27;re golden.</li>
    <li> This pump is great for the Redkin conditioner.  It gives the perfect amount of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I received two pumps and was very pleased with the cost.</li>
    <li> These are awesome pumps. I did not have any issues using these. I recently bought the Enjoy Luxury Shampoo and Conditioner 33.8oz and these work really well! Pretty easy to install and they pump out just the right amount!</li>
    <li> Good price, but not a cheap pump. Had to trim the tube a bit for it to fit into my shampoo bottles but that was easy.</li>
    <li> This pump DOES NOT fit the Matrix Biolage Shampoo in the 33.8 oz bottle.  The cap is too small and, therefore, you cannot screw the top on.  Will be returning this, as this is the third pump from a third provider that does not fit the bottle I have.</li>
    <li> These work wonderfully. I bought them for a different type of bottle than the Keratin and just cut the tube to fit. Each pump dispenses a perfect amount of product with little effort. I&#x27;m back to buy more for my other products.</li>
    <li> Great product for helping a large bottle of anything go a long way.  Helps give you a sense of how much you were really using before using the pump.</li>
    <li> Never bought a pump before and  don&#x27;t know if they are suppose to fit.  I had to cut it to fit, but it was not a problem.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a pump for our mouthwash that did not leak.  This one is wonderful.  I use it on a 16 oz bottle. I definitely would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> does the job as expected</li>
    <li> Works great but too short and when it stops pumping I still have a significant amount of conditioner left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> This pump is too long for your normal large liter of shampoo or conditioner. I could cut it down but I decided just to throw them away (I bought two of them) because they were so cheap it was not worth returning.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Fits too! So convenient w/large bottles of shampoo &amp; conditioner in shower!</li>
    <li> I need it for 33.8oz bottle of shampoo &amp; conditioner, works great.</li>
    <li> I received a gold colored pump, not the pearl color pictured. But it works great, and the straw is easy to cut to fit smaller bottles.</li>
    <li> The pump I got was a funky gold color.  But I just want some thing that works, and this is doing a great job.  One pump dispenses just the right amount.  Pumps easy.  Fits the bottle.</li>
    <li> Fits my large shampoo and conditioner perfectly...it is white rather than red as pictured, which is fine with me.</li>
    <li> I like the pumps but  (I bought 2) they are not black OR white like the description of them says..... The two I  ordered are copper color. Other than that I like them .....</li>
    <li> This product does work OK.  The only problem I have with it is after a couple of pumps come condition appears to be coming up through the part that goes into the bottle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find pumps for large bottles, and this fits the bill! I was looking for a pump for a Dr. Bronners bottle and I just had to trim this one a little. It&#x27;s much nicer having the full liter bottle right in the shower rather than having to constantly fill up smaller containers in order to have the pump action. This pump seems to be sturdy and good quality too, and I expect it to last a while. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with 1 liter bottles of Sebastian shampoo and conditioner. They fit the bottles perfectly, and I&#x27;ve never had any problem with the pumps.</li>
    <li> They seem to work well. Other people mentioned that there was only 1 pump in their order so I ordered 2....ended up being 2 pumps in each order so now I have an extra set!</li>
    <li> I buy shampoo/conditioner in bulk size bottles and these pumps are great to have. Makes it easy to use the originals bottles and not have to mess with transferring.</li>
    <li> I get the 1 lt. bottles of shampoo and condition when they are on special at my salon, these pumps work great and save money by not wasting product when in the shower..</li>
    <li> Fits a new bottle of Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, perfectly..</li>
    <li> It help me delete, knocking over the mouthwash bottle into the sink or onto the bathroom floor.  The pump work very well and give you good amount of mouthwash into the bathroom cup</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t figured out how to use these!!! If there were directions on how to release the pump - I missed them - so really no fault of Amazon or their supplier-</li>
    <li> States black or white, but it&#x27;s red</li>
    <li> I got a pearly white color pump and it fits perfectly on the 33.6 fl oz bottle of Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel Color Enhancing Treatment for Blonde Hair. When I opened the package, I thought the straw was going to be way too short for my bottle, but it is actually the perfect length. I would order this again if I had another jumbo bottle of shampoo or conditioner to use.</li>
    <li> These pumps are perfect for the large 33 oz bottles.  One pump was very easy to open, but the other one took a long time to finally open up.  That was the only problem we encountered.  Otherwise, I really like the pumps.  They let out just the right amount of shampoo and conditioner.  I plan on ordering another set of pumps very soon.  I just hope that they are easier to open up.</li>
    <li> Great pumps for shampoo or cream rinse or whatever.  Made well and very sturdy.  Glad I purchased them, and a very good buy.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not fit my 33.8 oz ISO shampoo and conditioner bottles or my 33.8 oz Healthy Sexy Hair bottles. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are the good Shampoo pumps on the market.  Unfortunately the image is black and I received a silver looking one.  I was hoping to get the black one as the image dictates.  They advertise white or black however have no way to select which one you are buying.  I also got the 3rd silver color that is not white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Product, just not the color I wanted.</li>
    <li> Pumps work well and were as described. I used them for at least six months and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems.</li>
    <li> Seller shipped quickly and I received my order in two days.  I only needed 2 pumps to fit into my Paul Mitchell 1L bottles, so having 2 extra pumps is a plus.  They work the way pumps should, so I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a pump for my 1L (33oz) Nioxin bottles and these fit perfectly.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought 2 for my Matrix Biolage bottles and they fit perfectly.  Both are white and take a few pumps to get the amount I need, but I&#x27;ll take that over constantly doing a balancing act of turning them upside down on their caps.  However, I would say pay attention to whom you&#x27;re buying from to try and insure you get something that fits.</li>
    <li> Love this pump it fit perfectly on my shampoo and conditioner bottles. Easy access in the shower</li>
    <li> This pump works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love these pums, fits all my bottles of shampoo. I nver buy small ones because its a waste of money so when I buy the bgger ones, my boys and I have a hard time getting the product out in the shower. Pumps really helpwhen your in a hurry or bathing a toddle. Great Buy!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It is a really good quality for the price and it fits perfect on Redken 1 liter bottles.&lt;br /&gt;If I need more, I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> For anyone that uses the Wella shampoo and conditioner I definitely recommend the pump for the conditioner helps control the flow. This does exactly what I needed it to do. Shipping was quick as well. I am thinking about buying another one for the shampoo.</li>
    <li> The bottle of body wash fell off the shower shelf and broke when it hit the tub bottom.  So this pump replaced it so that it is now easy to get the body wsah out while in the shower.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 1 liter Dr. Bonners Soap after seeing another reviewer claiming they were a good fit. I got them today, while the cap fits perfectly on the bottle, the plastic tube is about 1 inch too long for the bottle. A quick snip later and it was ready to go.  The pump is good, strong with smooth action, the first time I used it, I sent a long stream of soap down to the other end of the tub.  I&#x27;ve seen some reviews complaining about difficulties with unscrewing the cap, but I didn&#x27;t. I had more trouble trimming the tube than the cap.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these as each time Ulta runs their free pump with purchase promotions, they run out very quickly and don&#x27;t do rainchecks. These perfectly fit my ABBA liters but not my Brocato products but that&#x27;s ok. The pump can be cut to size so would fit smaller bottles too. Easy to use, complete with instructions. I was sent red which I don&#x27;t mind because now I can easily decipher which bottle is my shampoo and which is my conditioner. My shampoo has a white one.</li>
    <li> Not either advertised color, but that is to be expected from the other reviews. Did fit a 33.8 oz bottle for two different brands of shampoo I have. I ordered two. One works great. One arrived with a broken riser. Both were shipped in a locked position so the broken riser is not from shipping. The quality as stated in other reviews is not \\&quot;professional\\&quot; by any means but adequate for home use assuming you don&#x27;t receive a broken one. I ordered one to replace the broken one. Let&#x27;s face it. Three dollars isn&#x27;t worth the trouble of returning an item. Hopefully the replacement isn&#x27;t broken.    Update:  Third pump arrived in working order so I changed rating from a 2 to a 3.  It&#x27;s not such a bad deal really with the free shipping even with one broken.  I&#x27;d just order an extra next time.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Tresemme shampoo and conditioner bottles. The ones that came with them tend to ooze out the sides which was driving me bonkers! So, I decided to take a chance with these and they&#x27;re great! You just have to trim an inch or two off for the 32oz bottles. But, that&#x27;s not a big deal. Great product!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for what I ordered them for. Don&#x27;t know why shampoo&lt;br /&gt;manufacturers don&#x27;t offer these on their smaller bottles of shampoo and&lt;br /&gt;conditioner.  Too bad. Would charge more I&#x27;m sure. Their loss your gain.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I read reviews saying these were long , only reason I tried them so i ordered 3 for family , NOPE mine that i received were SHORT - theres about 2 inches of shampoo it will not reach</li>
    <li> Couple dollars well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived soon after purchasing, in good condition, and fit my liter size of professional shampoo and condition bottles perfecty! Can&#x27;t speak as to how long they will last, as I&#x27;ve only had a few months. But, guys, it&#x27;s just a few dollars. If/when it finally needs to be replaced, I&#x27;ll happily send for another set.</li>
    <li> good value &amp; received shipment promptly!</li>
    <li> Bought 2, so glad they matched, and aside from the fact that I had to cut the tube a little bit to fit my Tresemme bottles, they both work great!</li>
    <li> That stuff gets stuck in most other pumps. 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 more words. Not much to say on this one.</li>
    <li> These are so handy and worth the extra money. Picking up the liter bottles is a pain. Just remember to remove before discarding the bottles like I did last time!!</li>
    <li> If getting 32oz bottles of anything these pumps are wonderful! Very convenient to have and great price! Order you some!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I was under the impression it would fit a 1 to 1.5 Liter Listerine bottle, which it does not.</li>
    <li> I bought this pump for my kerastase 1000ml hair conditioner. It is good but I had to cut it because it was too long. I&#x27;ll buy another one for my shampoo</li>
    <li> I love having a pump on my large bottles of shampoo and conditioner, but even though this is advertised to fit the ISO shampoo and conditioner, it is hard to get the pump to stay on the bottles. The threads just are not quite right. I managed to get it to stay on the bottle so if I don&#x27;t have to move the bottle and can just use it from where it stands it is so much better than having to lift the whole heavy bottle to put it upside down and squeeze it through the cap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at the point where i have to keep the bottle tips upsidedown.  From feeling it seems like there is a third left in the bottle.  So not super user friendly at this stage.  I am using this with pureology liter bottles so it could be a design issue as well.  It pumps well though.</li>
    <li> pumt works great.  the pump that came with shampoo bottle did not work.  so im glad I bought this pump separate.  works great.  efficient.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought these pumps for a non-Keratin product, and they fit perfectly!!  The pumps work very well.  I highly recommend them if you need a pump for 1 Liter size shampoo or conditioner.  The vendor shipped these out very quickly, and they came packaged well.  Great product, great price, and great vendor!</li>
    <li> They work perfect for the 1 liter shampoo/ conditioner bottles!</li>
    <li> Title pretty much explains it.  I order this, and realized that I didn&#x27;t need it.  When I placed a claim to have the order cancelled, I was told it was too late to do so, but that I could return it when I got it.  When I looked into returning it, I found that it was more expensive than the item itself, so I figure I would keep it and give it to a friend.  When I opened the packaging up, the pump was cracked.  Overall experience a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> I got this to pump body oil out in the bath/shower and it fits great! Much easier than having to tip the bottle over with wet hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased these pumps hoping that they would fit the &amp;#34;Total Results Total Results Curl Shampoo, 33.8 Ounce&amp;#34; as well as the conditioner. They fit great! I haven&#x27;t tested to see if they get to the very bottom, but it looks good now.</li>
    <li> this was a suggested item pairing with the shampoo........but the shampoo bottle came with the pumps so these weren&#x27;t needed.</li>
    <li> Since they were so reasonably priced, I bought these hoping they&#x27;d fit the Matrix sleek look 33.8 ounce bottles.  The ones marketed specifically for the matrix bottles were much more expensive so I figured I&#x27;d risk it.  These were a perfect fit and length for the bottles.</li>
    <li> Great pumps which are a must have for 1 liter shampoo bottles. Can get to the product that gets trapped on the bottom so nothing gets wasted and it pumps just the right amount of product out so nothing gets wasted!</li>
    <li> This seemed like a great idea for the 33.8 ounce bottles of shampoo I purchase.  The straw portion was too long, so I had to cut to fit. Several weeks of use resulted in plenty of adjustments. The pump gave out before I finished the first bottle. Not sure that I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> It works like it is supposed too.</li>
    <li> Fits the ENJOY conditioner and shampoo large bottles perfectly! No cutting necessary.</li>
    <li> Used for my Sebastian Drench Shampoo and Conditioner 33.80z duo.  Fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> i am sure it works for the right bottle, but this was recommended for me because of a shampoo I got earlier - it did not fit the bottle,  just pay attention to the size of the bottle you get to see if this will fit - don&#x27;t know if that is a size they talk about in the shampoo or pump description.</li>
    <li> I tried to use the pumps from my old bottle but those had a wider lip and didn&#x27;t fit my new bottles. This worked fine, even on very thick conditioner. It came in 2 pieces, the bottom half of the straw attaches to the top half.</li>
    <li> I bought these to fit on my Redken 33oz bottles. They fit perfectly! They are beige, not white as pictured, but I&#x27;m not picky. They work great, so glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> These are some great pumps and are the perfect size for the Pureology shampoo/conditioner products. It is a &amp;#34;must buy&amp;#34; if purchasing any pumping product around 33 oz in size.</li>
    <li> Sadly it does not fit Matrix Biolage Neutralizing Shampoo or Cooling Mint Conditioner 33.8oz bottles. The pump wraps around the bottle&#x27;s mouth but does not screw in (it&#x27;s a tiny too wide). Now, I kept the pump because although it doesn&#x27;t screw in it still works... Just don&#x27;t grab it by the pump. It still pumps out the product just fine.</li>
    <li> They work great.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two thinking they were sold individually, but when I received them, it was a 2-pack.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll find a use for the extras, it just would have been nice if this was listed on the site.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for Redken products. You do have to pump twice, but not a deal-breaker for me. Now I can conserve my shampoo/conditioner and they won&#x27;t get waters down while in the shower.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!!!!  Saved the day, as the shampoo and conditioner I bought in the large size didn&#x27;t come with a pump, and try to lift a 33.8 OZ bottle and squeeze to get shampoo out when you have arthritic hands!!!  SO so happy to have these pumps.</li>
    <li> ordered for 33 oz bottles... but the tubing is so short that theres no way they would work by the time I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have use the same two for over a year now and they are still working great!! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> It is a great fit and works well.  Please note though the color pictured (black) is not the color I received. I received a champagne color.</li>
    <li> This item came and performed completely as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Did take me a minute to figure out how to unlock/open the pump.&lt;br /&gt;But figured it out pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> To save $$, I bought large bottles of shampoo and conditioner, then added these pumps. They work very well, with smooth action. Makes using my shampoo and conditioner very quick, and keeps me from having to handle the large bottles.</li>
    <li> I had a liter bottle of shampoo than fell in my shower causing the pump to break and therefor was unusable-- I purchased this and it fit perfectly on the bottle and I am now able to use what is left of the shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t pump quite as smoothly as the original which is why it only got 4 stars-- it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Fits ok on Kérastase big bootle</li>
    <li> This pump fits my wella shampoo and conditioner perfectly.  It makes it so much easier to use. Great price great pump.</li>
    <li> The pumps are nice quality and work well.  They do not fit the bottles that I purchased them for (ISO 33.8 fl. oz.) They are an ideal length, but they do not screw down onto the neck of the bottle.  However, I am still able to pump the shampoo out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> easier than pouring out of large bottle</li>
    <li> These fit the Enjoy bottles, but not perfectly.  They are some what difficult to put on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the pumps for the big shampoos</li>
    <li> 100% professional material and function!</li>
    <li> It makes the application so easy while using in the shower.</li>
    <li> great pump.. fits my biolage shampoo..  great product.  would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> The pump does not fit the bottle properly. it pops off easily and i will not buy this product again</li>
    <li> I originally looked at the pump that said it was for nioxin 33 oz bottles but alot of ppl said on their review that it didnt fit correctly and someone suggested this pump. It fits NO problem. I havent finished my bottle yet so im not sure if it will stop short of pumping the last of it. Im happy so far</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works well. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Bought it for my Pureology shampoo and conditioner.  My daughter is using the other ones I have.  They fit very well and work perfectly.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Came to me in perfect condition.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they&#x27;ll work wonderfully when I do need to use them.</li>
    <li> This Keratin Complex pump was my answer to getting all the shampoo and conditioner out of the bottle, but the only complaint I have is when I have to put it away, you want to close it so no shampoo comes out.  I close it, you lose a lot of shampoo to press it down to close it and then it pops up a lot of times and you have to keep pressing it down again to close it again and keep losing shampoo.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect fit for my big shampoo and conditioner bottles.. Works great. No Issues. Would buy this again</li>
    <li> Fast service, no hassles, and all is well.  Good product as expected.  It is now in use with no problems.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my monster sized bottles of Paul Mitchell products :)</li>
    <li> Love it!  No wasting my conditioner any more!</li>
    <li> I bought these pumps for my 33 oz Aveda shampoo and conditioner bottles.  They fit perfectly and work as advertised.  Price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> I ordered these HOPING that they would fit my large Redken bottles and they DO!  These are exactly what I was looking for but could not find for Redken.  They work perfectly too.  I highly-recommend these pumps.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on my Matrix Bottles. Highly recommend these pumps, they get the job done and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works great for my liter sized shampoo and conditioner. Had them for a while now and they&#x27;re still working great.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Redken 1 litre bottles of shampoo and conditioner. The pumps make shampooing and conditioning much easier while in the shower -- I don&#x27;t have to bother with getting the bottle open, turning it upside down, while hoping the right amount of product will end up in my hand. The pumps give me control over how much product I use for each shampoo/condition. I definitely recommend these pumps for the 1 litre bottles of product.</li>
    <li> While this product fit the large American Crew shampoo bottle fine, the residual shampoo that settled around the top of the pump (inside the mechanism) quickly discolored and got gross.  With no way to clean it out I just had to throw them out.  Not fit for purpose.</li>
    <li> GREAT service.GREAT item.</li>
    <li> I bought this to work with my Biolage Exquisite Oil 1 liters. It fits perfectly and makes it so much easier to dispense!</li>
    <li> Pumps work fine in Biolage liters. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I put this pump on my mouthwash container (1 liter) and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love these. One squirt is all you need, so it&#x27;s measures right everytime. and we both shampoo our hair daily</li>
    <li> If that is what you are looking for, this is surely the product. I will order again and recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Could not find a pump to replace the one that had broken. This item did a great job in filling our needs. Without it I would have had to scrap my present use and try and pick up a different container. It handles the consistency of shampoo in an excellent manner.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Use these for 1 Liter shampoo/conditioners. I also have one inside a 1L bottle of hand/body lotion.</li>
    <li> must have for large shampoo bottles</li>
    <li> Pump works really well with Coppola shampoo and conditioner bottles. I had a bit of trouble when first bought opening the pump. Once open no troubles.</li>
    <li> Fits the shampoo bottles from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply perfectly!</li>
    <li> Does not fit my bottle of conditioner, had to use duct tape to make it work. NOT universal as described.</li>
    <li> Ordered along with Pureology Liter set and works great! One pump is enough for longer hair.  I have had for over a month now and has not clogged.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Use it everyday.  Quality item.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome fit no need to adjust for length. Inexpensive and saves a bundle on waste. Not to mention the two handle struggle with these large sizes!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting that the shampoo and conditioner duo that I ordered had no pump as shown on the photo. That is why I got to order these. But I was surprised, both bottles have pump already. So anyway the pump will be an extra in case I needed them.</li>
    <li> I bought very large bottles of my favorite shampoo and conditioner. These are perfect in size and makes dispensing so easy!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my oversized Tresamme shampoo and conditioner bottles. They worked out great. I did have to cut them down a little since the pump tube was a bit too long but they work perfectly.</li>
