      <li>and it looks nice too.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume just before Christmas because I liked the scent.  </li>
      <li>Okay we laughed after it was all over.  </li>
      <li>We also adore the container, it&#x27;s really handy</li>
      <li>and I just happened to slip that I really liked this scent.</li>
      <li>I have never been a Britney fan, nor a perfume wearer, but this stuff is really nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly a fun burst of many magnificent scents all blended together to form this cute, playful perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s is a very strong smell.</li>
      <li>It has a soft scent,and its just wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sweet and floral, and the bottle is really cute too!</li>
      <li>This of course, had yet to be my first encounter of this scent, for a friend too has told me great things about it.</li>
      <li>It smells so great and the bottle is soooooo pretty.</li>
      <li>The packaging is very detailed, the box itself opens like a flower.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice and clean smelling, light - and</li>
      <li>While I loved The Great Gatsby, classical is not my smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree with her more.</li>
      <li>and I am sure you will love it too</li>
      <li>I have gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is one of the best women&#x27;s perfumes on the market,</li>
      <li>I too got a card in my magazine and thought it was okay until I got this stuff on my hands.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I got this perfume for Christmas last year and everything about it from bottle to scent is awesome!  </li>
      <li>This was truly that and more.  </li>
      <li>This perfume is probably mostly alcohol and sold for a steep price because of Britney Spears named being slapped on it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties, and I collect perfume, based on their bottles mostly, it would seem.  </li>
      <li>THEN MAKE SURE YOU ALSO CHECK THE PRICETAG.  </li>
      <li>And as sexy as Britney Spears herself.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t begin on how sexy this smells.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s Britney&#x27;s Spears latest business effort.  </li>
      <li>and I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>It smelled okay,</li>
      <li>no problems, but I wasn&#x27;t in love with it.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m sure you will not regret buying it.</li>
      <li>I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>Drump Britney and get a better bargain in the end.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>Okay, here goes.  </li>
      <li>I ended up falling in love with the scent and bought the 1.7 oz.</li>
      <li>Somewhere in between is people in their 20&#x27;s to 40&#x27;s that have better taste than to wear something</li>
      <li>Not overpowering, just a hint of sexy.</li>
      <li>This is the most foul-smelling scent I have ever known of that someone has intentionally created.  </li>
      <li>Spend more time developing character</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for a really good quality product.</li>
      <li>Yes girls, even barnyard animals have better taste than to wear this....</li>
      <li>it was britneys idea to include an elegant vintage style atomiser for her love of vintage design.</li>
      <li>Sure I like my perfumes and makeup</li>
      <li>As though a 5-star review of a perfume will make it sell better.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Save your money girls.  This stuff can stink up a room in a Kentwood second!!  Why do females think they can attract men only by putting on perfume you can smell from across a football field??  I&#x27;m a guy and my girlfriend wore this stuff.  It was gag-worth, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> What is it with boyfriends?  I also got this scent as a gift for Christmas.  The only good thing about it was my boyfriend got it from a store that would exchange it for something else.  This is really overpriced because Britney Spears has her name on it!!  The scent is way to STRONG and floral for me.   It&#x27;s just what I expect from Spears:  Expensive but cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Over-the-top florals that are so strong the smell made by eyes water.  Did you ever smell perfume that was so strong you could smell it for days, even if you used just a little??  This is the one.  The one that guys complain about and finally have the nerve to let you know.  Expensive to buy but cheap smelling.  That&#x27;s Britney&#x27;s Spears latest business effort.  It figures!</li>
    <li> It worked great cleaning my car battery.  As a perfume, it&#x27;s awful</li>
    <li> This fragrance is hot! I dont know why people are calling it cheap. its not. its made by elizabeth arden and the ingredients were carefully chosen to stand for britney. she also helped design the bottle. it was britneys idea to include an elegant vintage style atomiser for her love of vintage design. so before you call it cheap, get your facts straight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent my whole life searching for the perfect perfume that I could wear every day and not get bored after a week or two. This is it! Curious smells so classy and pretty, and it&#x27;s subtle, not obnoxious, but just right. Not to mention the glamorous Old Hollywood bottle with the atomizer that it comes in. Makes you feel like a movie star. I have never loved a perfume as much as this one!</li>
    <li> It is Fresh, Sexy and Clean. The result is a skin-scent - real, intimate, exciting. A scent as immaculate and creamy as a lush white rose. And as sexy as Britney Spears herself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;FRESH: &lt;br /&gt;Orange flower. Grapefruit. Tones of bright citrus. Start the scent off on a high note. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SEXY: &lt;br /&gt;Rose. Sandalwood, Soft Amber. Sheer florals unfold provocatively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CLEAN: &lt;br /&gt;Transparent jasmine. Vanilla. Musk. Orris. Beg for you to get closer.</li>
    <li> After trying a sample at the store, I knew I loved the scent. I didn&#x27;t buy then, because my mom, a Britney Spears super-hater, was with me. I was out shopping with my cousin and I just happened to slip that I really liked this scent. She told my parents and they (reluctantly) bought it for me for Christmas. I was so excited and it smells absolutely wonderful! Just because Britney Spears is sleezy doesn&#x27;t mean her perfume is.</li>
    <li> Do you want your boyfriend or your husbund ask you why you smell so good and take you out for a great dinner?? Buy this fragrances and you can get what you want. Britney Spears&#x27;s Curious is the best fragrances ever made!!</li>
    <li> 5 Star rating is not enough for this perfume!!!.  Frankly There isnt enough stars to rate this.  I wear it every chance I get.  I spray it on me at least 4 times a day.  I went out the first day it was released in stores and bought the ENTIRE line (Large Bottle with Atomizer, Small Bottle, Lotion, Shimmer Stick, &amp; Body Wash).  I even had to spend 3 hours looking for the perfect mirred vanity tray to display it on.  This is the BEST smelling perfume I have EVER smelled.  I just can not keep it off of me.  I sprayed it all over my house and on my bed and everywhere I am, even in my car.  Every one (Boy or Girl, Man or Woman) should purchase this perfume as the PERFECT gift for ANY occassion.</li>
    <li> I took a sample of this perfume home one day; now my mom, my two sisters, and even my grandmother have it. The smell is very sophisticated and obviously, it appeals to all ages. The packaging is very detailed, the box itself opens like a flower. The bottle has this antique appearance, and it&#x27;s very feminine. Overall, this is one of the best women&#x27;s perfumes on the market, no wonder it&#x27;s the number one women&#x27;s perfume sold in retail stores.</li>
    <li> Looks like a lot of guys bought this for for their girlfriends assuming we all want to smell like a CHEAP tart!!.  To his defense and mine, we both like Britney when we were kids.  Neither of us are that now.  I love him but hate this crummy perfume.  Leave it to Britney to come up with a cheap smelling perfume in a cheap-looking package.</li>
    <li> Sometime in my distant childhood (I&#x27;m now 23, Spears age), I liked Britney Spears.  Also in my distant childhood, she made good music.  However, I grew up but people in my family still remember those days because I got this as a Christmas present.  I wish I could recommend it but I cannot.  Now that I see how much it COSTS, I can&#x27;t recommend it.  First, the bottle is a bright cheap-looking blue and is just cheap-looking.  But the perfume is really too strong.  Very sweet-smelling and strong.  This is what very young kids or grandmothers would wear.  Somewhere in between is people in their 20&#x27;s to 40&#x27;s that have better taste than to wear something this sticky sweet.  That includes me.  I would never buy this perfume for myself.</li>
    <li> TAKE IT FROM ME I AM A 26 YEAR OLD WIFE, PROFESSIONAL NURSE, MOTHER OF AN 18 MONTH OLD AND AN 8 YEAR OLD.  MY BEST FRIEND AND I WERE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING AND A FRAGRANCE GIRL HANDED US THIS SCENT, THIS ONE WE DID NOT DUMP IN THE NEXT TRASH BIN.WE LOVED IT!BELIEVE ME, WE HAVE VERY DISCRIMINATING TASTE.IT&#x27;S NOT AT ALL OLD LADY.WE WENT OUT OF OUR WAY TO GO BACK AND LOOK FOR THE GIRL TO GET MORE INFO.WE WERE IMMEDIATLEY TURNED OFF WHEN WE FOUND OUT WHO&#x27;S IT WAS, WE WERE NEVER BIG FANS. ANYWAY ON THE RIDE HOME WE COULDN&#x27;T STOP TALKING ABOUT IT, WELL IT WAS OUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO EACH OTHER. I&#x27;LL ADMIT WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT SCENT I&#x27;M WEARING, I GET EMBARASSED BECAUSE OF THE OBVIOUS, BUT PEOPLE NEED TO GET OVER THE FACT THAT IT&#x27;S NOT A BAD SCENT.I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY,BUT IT&#x27;S CLEAN AND FRESH AND REMINDS ME OF THAT OLD REVLON SHAMPOO CALLED OUTRAGEOUS.THOSE OF YOU COMMENTING ON THE STRENGTH, WELL MAYBE YOU HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH FUN WITH THE ATOMIZER, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.AS FAR AS THE BOTTLE LOOKING CHEAP,IT DOESN&#x27;T.HONESTLY, I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BOUGHT IT, JUST TO HAVE THE LARGE BOTTLE WITH THE ATOMIZER ON MY VANITY, MAYBE THE ATOMIZER GIVES IT A LITTLE OOMPH, THE SMALLER ONE DOES NOT HAVE AN ATOMIZER. I&#x27;VE ADDED IT AMONGST MY FAVORITES ESTEE LAUDER&#x27;S BEAUTIFUL, CLINIQUE&#x27;S HAPPY, HERRERA FOR WOMEN (I KNOW THAT&#x27;S A LITTLE OLD LADY BUT IT&#x27;S SO CLASSIC). TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING THIS SCENT OLD LADY,TAKE A WHIFF OF CHANEL #5, OR ESTEE LAUDER&#x27;S YOUTH DEW, NOW THAT&#x27;S OLD LADY!!ANYWAY IF YOU WANT TO SMELL GREAT, THEN TRY IT.DON&#x27;T LISTEN TO ALL THOSE NEGATIVE COMMENTS...BUT DO LISTEN TO ALL YOUR COMPLIMENTS.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this for me.  All I could wonder is how old does she think I am!!  I took one whiff and UGH, this stuff is poisonous!!  I can see from the prices that she paid a lot for it.  Probably thought it would appeal to me because I&#x27;m young.  omg!!!!  This is beyond terrible.</li>
    <li> Personally I do not like this perfume, and I am a huge fan of Britney Spears. To me it smells cheap, even though it clearly isn&#x27;t. As some reviewers have said it reminds me of an old woman type smell. If you like musky fragrances such as Jovan Musk then this may appeal to you, but otherwise you&#x27;d probably hate it. It&#x27;s is a very strong smell. It&#x27;s difficult to describe a perfume but I&#x27;d say this one is a Musk with Vanilla tones.    For the money I feel you can purchase a much nicer smelling perfume, and you&#x27;ll get more of it.</li>
    <li> My sweet boyfriend bought this junk for me at Christmas.  I returned it before New Years.  I won&#x27;t have this trashy stinky stuff in my apartment.  Smells like a cheap hotel.  Smells like Britney Spears</li>
    <li> That would have been a more appropriate name for Britney Spear&#x27;s new \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; (?).  I also got a free card in one of my magazines.  It smelled okay, no problems, but I wasn&#x27;t in love with it.  Fragrances are very personal to me and I hate over-the-top fragrances that you can smell from outer space.  Unfortunately my husband thought I loved the sample card and bought it for me.  Oh lordy this stuff is bad!  Just because I&#x27;m young doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to walk around like some junked out teenager trying to be Britney Spears.  Like one other reviewer, I was fortunate enough to get my money back and get something else that I liked.  It&#x27;s just too sticky sweet and overpowering for me.</li>
    <li> I had the biggest argument with my girlfriend when I gave this to her for Christmas.  First of all, I don&#x27;t like heavy cheap-smelling perfumes.  This is all of that plus a bag of chips!!  Unknowingly, I  kept insisting that she spray this on herself!!  I just smelled it and it was terrible.  Instead she sprayed it on me and told me to wear it!!  I smelled like a cheap $&amp;*x all day.  Okay we laughed after it was all over.  But I learned my lesson.  I don&#x27;t tell women what to wear and they don&#x27;t make ME wear it.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is don&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews.  It seems that most of the people who did not like it, are young and are ashamed about their past enjoyment of Britney Spears because its not cool for your age group anymore.  I did not buy this scent because its Britney Spears&#x27;, I went sprayed it on a card, along with take alongs of other scents, and then decided later after I smelled it at home.  I loved it!!  Almost every scent will give me a headache but not this one.  It is my new everyday scent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Get over the Britney stigma associated with this fragrance, be yourself.  If you like something, like it not matter what someone else will think. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Go to the darned store and try it out before you buy it!!  Then you&#x27;ll be able to determine why you should plunk down big dough for a perfume that doesn&#x27;t have any unique qualities except for Britney Spears name.  Sheesh!!  The people here are unbelievable.  As though a 5-star review of a perfume will make it sell better.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING A PERFUME WITHOUT TESTING IT FIRST!!  It&#x27;s that simple.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Look, I do NOT like Britney as a person or as a \\&quot;singer\\&quot;. But i&#x27;ll give credit where credit is due, and this stuff smells SO GOOD!! People are lying when they say they think it smells disgusting. Really, don&#x27;t let your persona lfeelings about Mrs. Federline damage your opinion of this scent. It&#x27;s very sweet and floral, and the bottle is really cute too!</li>
    <li> Personaly I don&#x27;t normaly wear perfume.But I LOVE Curious.At first I thought Britney Spears has a perfume? I was like,\\&quot;It can&#x27;t smell all that great\\&quot;.Boy was I wrong!Britney you have another hit.And a new fan.</li>
    <li> When I first heard that Britney Spears was coming out with a fragrance I was like figures because it seems like every other celebrity is coming out with a perfume!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went to a department store and saw this on the counter I was really attracted to the bottle it had an antique look to it with the atomizer while also looking very modern with the aqua blue crystal with the pink hearts (very cute) so I sprayed it on my wrist I thought why not. To my surprise it smelt awesome and it lasted all day! The scent is very fresh and clean and it&#x27;s not to flowery! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Curious by Britney Spears is my favorite scent and I wear it all the time. I swear by it. My boyfriend loves it! Gotten so many compliments wearing this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t experienced this scent you should! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this scent but I went to a local department store to buy it and the fragrance saleswoman would not sell it to me because about 90% of the bottles sold are being returned because it&#x27;s so fragile, and the bottles will actually break in the box. She recommended that I wait to buy it when they redesign the bottle. Love the scent, don&#x27;t want to waste $40-$50.</li>
    <li> I had been to the mall with my grandma the day the stuff came out and I walked over and smelled it and I loved it so did my anut. So today when I opened up a present the was all of the Courious stuff I could think of It smells great. By it if you are a Boy Grl Male of Female</li>
    <li> OMG this is terrible!  As soon as I sprayed it I felt like I had been dunked in a barrell of Febreeze.  I&#x27;m happy it didn&#x27;t last long because I needed oxygen after that.</li>
    <li> Well, sure, i don&#x27;t really like Britney Spears. But I wanted to give my girlfriend a gift and i came upon it and i just loved the smell. And she does too. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong or light either, it&#x27;s the perfect blend of scents. We also adore the container, it&#x27;s really handy and it looks nice too. The price may be a little expensive but it&#x27;s worth it for a really good quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m too young to smell like a Funeral Home.  I got this for Christmas and returned it a couple of days later.  Beside the fact that it smells horrible, the bottle looks cheap.  I have two pretty perfume bottles on my table.  This one belongs back in the store, and that&#x27;s where it went</li>
    <li> Not overpowering, just a hint of sexy. Mild, Light, clean floral.</li>
    <li> When I first saw &#x27;Curious&#x27; while on holiday, I bought it without trying any. I just wanted the pretty bottle. When I managed to get it home, without smashing it, what did I think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. At work, everyone always ask what I&#x27;m wearing. Magnolia, lotus flower, white flowers, cyclamen, vanilla-infused musk, creamy sandalwood and blonde woods are all combined into the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best surprise: after I&#x27;ve worn it for a few hours, you are surprised with the mouth-watering aroma of tangy pear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all combines to make &#x27;Curious&#x27; utterly wearable, great for any and every occasion!!</li>
    <li> I love it. I have never been a Britney fan( don&#x27;t think I will ever be) but I have nothing but praise for this perfume. At first I had a good laugh with my friends about a &#x27;Britney scent&#x27;. A couple of weeks later, I wanted to see what the fuss is all about ( and I like the bottle) and I fell in love with it. The best part? It lasts all day.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perceived cheap?? No way. Everyone who actually steps out of the house to take a walk at the malls would know that it is more expensive than others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Have fun, hope this helps.</li>
    <li> With so many singers trying to go under the fragrance microscope, it can be very difficult to tell if people want it for the singer and image, or the actual smell of a fragrance. This is something Britney Spears should really consider the hard way. Her Curious perfume is arguably the singer worst perfume I&#x27;ve ever purchased for my mother. She not only hates the smell, she said it smells worse than a poo poo platter. I couldn&#x27;t agree with her more. Perhaps instead she should try to make it a scent of a banana, or a peach flavor. If you want to try it go ahead, but it is not really worth the money Spears labeled it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: F-</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t begin on how sexy this smells. Theres no better smell in the world. I&#x27;m a guy, and Britney&#x27;s #1 fan, and I bought this and Fantasy along with all of the other items and promos shes released. My girlfriend wears this and it drives me nuts. It doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume, it actually smells appealing and pure. It&#x27;s not strong after sitting for about 10 seconds, then the beautiful aroma comes out. Take it from a guy, ladies: we dig it</li>
    <li> This is the perfect every day scent for me: nice and light, not overpowering at ALL (everyone who says it&#x27;s too strong must be putting waaay too much on), and yet very youthful without being childish. I bought a small bottle just to try it, and now I love it. I will definitely buy the bigger bottle when the small one runs out. I have never been a Britney fan, nor a perfume wearer, but this stuff is really nice.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on it...by my advice to the ladies who want to buy perfume via online...buy the smaller bottles first to see if you really like the scent...moreso than the big bottles.  i bought the $50 one and i do like it, but i think it&#x27;s gonna take me awhile to finish it...so from now on, i&#x27;ll buy the 1.7 oz. first and then buy the bigger bottles if i like the scent.  but overall, very fresh and sweet smelling...</li>
    <li> Maybe because I&#x27;m 20 the woman at the perfume counter took liberties and sprayed this stuff on me.  OMG!!  Cheap, cheesy but overpriced.  Just like Spears herself.  If I wanted to smell like a streetwalker I&#x27;d save my money and buy the cheap stuff from a grocery store.</li>
    <li> This is one heavy-handed scent!!  I too got a card in my magazine and thought it was okay until I got this stuff on my hands.  I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the heavy overpowering smell.  It smells like little old lady stuff!!  Oh yeah, and the PRICE....I work too hard for my money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t trust the magazine sample and ignore the person, just go and try it out for yourself.  As a totally impartial person and a perfume shopoholic I think it is a great scent.  To me it smells like a lovely light white floral scent with a touch of sweetness.  It is not overly sweet and blends quickly.  I wear perfume on my pulse points 45 mins before leaving the house and Curious certainly doesn&#x27;t offend anyone in my office.  By later in the day it can only be smelled lightly where I sprayed it.  I think it is a fun, feminine scent, with a really distinctive bottle, which deserves a chance.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it, I received this as a gift.  It&#x27;s nauseatingly floral and way too powerful a scent for my taste.  Hopefully I won&#x27;t get anymore perfumes as gifts because it&#x27;s a personal thing that must appeal to the individual taste.  For me, I didn&#x27;t care for it.  I don&#x27;t care for the woman it&#x27;s named for either and everything about this perfume is like her.  The bottle looks cheap.</li>
    <li> Since I don&#x27;t want to walk out in public smelling like a cheap tart, I didn&#x27;t waste my money on this stuff.  It&#x27;s bad enough the company put one of those cards in my magazine and it stunk up my apartment for days!</li>
    <li> Let me make it clear from the get go that I am NOT a fan of Mrs. Spears. In fact, there was a time when I down right couldn&#x27;t stand her. I at first scoffed at the idea of her releasing her own perfume line. Just another over paid star trying to get that much richer. Despite my initial feelings, out of curiosity, I decided to try a sample. I ended up falling in love with the scent and bought the 1.7 oz. bottle and the body creme! What I love about this perfume is that it is strong enough to last all day but it is not too heavy. It is a very elegant and mature scent that can be worn casually or to more formal affairs. So if you&#x27;ve been looking for a new scent, ignore the name on the bottle and check this out.</li>
    <li> Expensive product, absolutely appallingly cheap stuff.  Yes, it&#x27;s Britney Spears&#x27; Perfume alright.  I got a bottle as part of my Valentine&#x27;s Day gift from my boyfriend.  I returned it the next day.  He never knew the difference.  Somehow he thought that because I&#x27;m young I want to smell or do anything like Britney Spears.  Actually, I wear Lalique (anyone who would buy Britney Spears perfume would not know what it is).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have too much intregrity and class to have this stuff in my apartment, even at the age of 22.</li>
    <li> My little sister requested this product for her birthday.  I went to a store to buy it, but luckily, I sampled it first!  This is the most foul-smelling scent I have ever known of that someone has intentionally created.  If I were to get this for ANYONE I know, I would hope to not have to see them when they sprayed this repulsive stuff on themselves!</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume in years!!! the essence smell great, the bottle is very cool... Another Britney Hit</li>
    <li> I am by no means a perfume girl, which is why I was shocked when I opened my birthday/chritmas present from my mother&#x27;s friends to find this sitting on my lap. My first instict was too say &#x27;Is this a joke?!&#x27;, but I decided too save it &amp; just smiled sweetly and said thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later when I opened it and decided to sample it, I thought the bottle was just adorable and it reminded me of how perfume was bottle in the old days. When I smelt it, the perfume had this classical taste which reminded me of the bottle which reminded of the good ol&#x27; 30&#x27;s jazz age era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a classy gal and when I was smell this I think of The Great Gatsby or something like that. While I loved The Great Gatsby, classical is not my smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t atrocious, just avoid this perfume if you don&#x27;t like anything strong or classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ciao</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this perfume.  It is very feminine, but without being too overwhelming.  My problem is that the scent does not last long.  I hate having to reapply several times a day.  I know that you get used to a scent and you don&#x27;t smell it after a while, but I have even asked other people later in the day and they couldn&#x27;t smell the perfume on me either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy i bought Curious for my mom she loves it its her favorite perfume, i recently gave it to my girlfriend for her b-day she says its one of the best perfumes out there. I personally love it on my girlfriend. Its way better than J.Lo&#x27;s Glow or Still. I recomend this to all u lady&#x27;s out there its a perfect 10 : )</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what they SHOULD have named this loud and cheap-smelling stuff.  I got a card in the mail with it and it stunk up my house for a week.  Unfortunately I got it on something and couldn&#x27;t get it out.  Eweeee.  The only thing \\&quot;Curious\\&quot; about it is how they expect to sell this expensive trash.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume just before Christmas because I liked the scent.  Within 2 days of wearing it I got sick of it.  It is quite overpowering and my husband hates it on me.  Well, that&#x27;s not why I got rid of it.  The stuff doesn&#x27;t wear well.  It gave me a headache it was so heavily on the florals.  Nothing really new, I&#x27;ve had floral perfumes many, many times.  But this is the first time one gave me a migraine.  Just be aware if you want to buy it that you should try it in the store first and walk around for awhile before you buy.  You may regret you bought it if you don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Oh, I was supposed to review the perfume!?!  Okay, here goes.  I smelled it on a grandma that was sampling it in the store.  She loved it (looked like she was 70&#x27;ish).  The out of curiosity I watched the customers go by.  No one in the teen to 30 crowd even stopped.  Bottom line:  Great for grannies, not so great for anyone else.</li>
    <li> Why my boyfriend thought I wanted to smell like a cheap tart left me not only curious but mad as h.......   I don&#x27;t try to make him smell like a barn, he shouldn&#x27;t try to make me smell anywhere near Britney Spears.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  The bottle is sooo cute and this perfume smells very feminine and girly.  I couldn&#x27;t wear tooo much of it though as it could become sickly.</li>
    <li> I received my Curious perfume not last christmas, but the christmas before.. and i was SO excited, i had already been through the shops at least 15 times just trying it on over and over, using every tester i could find. &lt;br /&gt;when i got it, i was just as happy and used it just *so* carefully, i wanted it to last for years.  &lt;br /&gt;i got the one that comes with the pump, the largest bottle.... anyway,  &lt;br /&gt;i now look over to my dresser and see it sitting there. YELLOW. &lt;br /&gt;my curious perfume &lt;br /&gt;WENT &lt;br /&gt;YELLOW &lt;br /&gt;and apparently mine was not the only one that went bright yellow, my brothers girlfriends is also a lovely urine coloured yellow.  &lt;br /&gt;it also grew a sticky coat of curious smelling...crud.. around the bottle and just today i went over to it, only to find it LEAKING all over my table... i squeeze the pump and it is rock hard... i look over to the nozzle and it is covered in a thick crust, the whole thing has crusted over and is leaking, i squeezed it again and  my curious perfume  splerted out.. &lt;br /&gt;it now smells off &lt;br /&gt;and doesn&#x27;t really look all that fantastic as you may have guessed. &lt;br /&gt;i am DISGUSTED and so  &lt;br /&gt;so angry &lt;br /&gt;that perfume i wanted so bad and was so excited to get now sits on the table surrounded by it&#x27;s own disgusting pool of crust and leaking hardened perfume (i didn&#x27;t even know that was possible)  &lt;br /&gt;i am disgusted &lt;br /&gt;what a cheap nasty NASTY product. &lt;br /&gt;do NOT buy it unless you think you&#x27;re going to use it within a period of 1 year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;good work! &lt;br /&gt;a product as cheap and nasty as the person endorsing it &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Obviouisly, smells different on everyone, but at it&#x27;s  &lt;br /&gt;base, a very warm, sweet smell.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, this perfume struck me as slightly left of ordinary, much like the pop songstress herself. Not a bad trait by any means, it&#x27;s subtle enough to wear to work, but different in it&#x27;s bouquet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Wow, I cannot begin to express how amazing this perfume smells! I wear it everyday on every occasion. I have gotten so many compliments on it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a light touch of a smell, but at the same time it&#x27;s incredibly invigorating. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing \\&quot;Curious\\&quot; again.</li>
    <li> When I first saw all the Britney ads for this perfume I was turned off by it automatically. However after I finally tried it I found that it was truly unique. I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it. It is a mix of exotic floral scents, mixed with sweet-smelling undertones. I would definately buy it again!</li>
    <li> My poor Gran, I love her dearly!  She can hardly see anymore and definitely can&#x27;t smell anything.  She also thinks I&#x27;m still 13 (I&#x27;m 20) and have no taste.  This is awful junk that belongs in dollar stores so people can&#x27;t mistake it for anything else or pay too much.  Buy it because Britney Spears name is on it???  Oh yeah, my live is that sad.</li>
    <li> This junk smells terrible!!  My Mom actually bought this for my birthday and somehow she&#x27;s in denial that I&#x27;m now 17.  Sure I like my perfumes and makeup but this is absolutely awful.  My Mom must think I&#x27;m still a Britney groupie, when I gave that up years ago when I grew up and had taste.  Now I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.  I can&#x27;t return it, so I&#x27;m stuck.</li>
    <li> i bought this fragance for my sister, and it smells great. its different from all of the other fragances. It smells really good!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that the scent is strong, because that means I do not need to reapply the perfume after only a little while. It smells so great and the bottle is soooooo pretty. I was honestly not expecting this perfume to be that good when I heard of it but it was! I recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume!  I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties, and I collect perfume, based on their bottles mostly, it would seem.  Anyway, I got this perfume for Christmas last year and everything about it from bottle to scent is awesome!  It&#x27;s not overly powerful, and it&#x27;s not fruity or flowery.  Those are important key factors when I&#x27;m choosing my perfumes...  I definitely recommend it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, I&#x27;m not a fan of Britney Spears as a musician or an actress...  I just happened to be attracted to this perfume first by the bottle and now by the scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to start off by saying it&#x27;s how it makes you feel and how long that feeling will last - not the person who put his/her name on it. Get over the hype and indulge yourself in this very pretty scent! It&#x27;s truly a fun burst of many magnificent scents all blended together to form this cute, playful perfume. If you&#x27;re looking for a light, flirtatious find - this is the perfume for you and I recommend it highly to the more than picky souls out there. My only concern is how long this lasts, as it tends to fade a little more than Britney&#x27;s recent perfume, Fantasy - Otherwise, this will have your co-workers &#x27;curious&#x27; as to what exactly you&#x27;re sporting - It&#x27;s definitetly worth it.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOD! This perfume totally took my breath away! It&#x27;s totally amazing. I was eager to smell Britney&#x27;s new fragrance when it came out, and ended up buying everything the scent came in. I dared to be different, and I was left smelling GREAT! Britney Spears, Curious, is the best smelling perfume on the market. For those of you who have yet to try it, GO AHEAD, I DARE YOU, it will be the best purchase you make.</li>
    <li> I am not a Britney Spears fan so I certainly did not expect much from the fragrance...  I did love the bottle though and decided to see what she had to offer...  I do love it and can&#x27;t wait to get the whole set!  It&#x27;s very nice and clean smelling, light - and even my husband likes it!  (that is something that is rare)...</li>
    <li> I first smelt this perfume in a magazine and hated it, but then i smelt it again and again and all i gotta say is that it smells amazing, better than any other womans perfume i have smelt, i purchased two of these, one for my mum on her birthday and one for my girlfriend, the smell is so great, i just love the smell of it, it makes the perfect gift because you will be sure the person who recieves the gift will love it.</li>
    <li> Wow, I cannot begin to express how amazing this perfume smells! I wear it everyday on every occasion. I have gotten so many compliments on it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a light touch of a smell, but at the same time it&#x27;s incredibly invigorating.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing \\&quot;Curious\\&quot; again.</li>
    <li> Looks like anything Britney Spears puts her name to stinks.  I agree with the one-star raters, it&#x27;s one expensive but cheap-smelling odor.  Since I don&#x27;t dress like a hooker, I don&#x27;t want to smell like one either.  It was a gift so I wore it.  My boyfriend wanted to hose me off and couldn&#x27;t apologize enough.  We had a good laff later, he got his money back, and I got gold earrings!!  Drump Britney and get a better bargain in the end.</li>
    <li> I got a free card in the mail too.  Put it in the trash (where anything with Spears name belongs).  It actually stunk up my garbabe can for weeks!  Even the garbage men complained---accused me of dumping toxic waste in my garbage can.  It&#x27;s illegal in my state.  This stuff should carry a skull and crossbones.</li>
    <li> Aw come on!  Like, you believe people buy scents online??  Don&#x27;t do it!!  IF you can actually find a store that sells this you should try it ahead so you&#x27;re not disappointed in how awful it is.  It&#x27;s only my opinion, but it&#x27;s darned awful</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I not only bought this, but that I love it as well!  The name almost kept me from getting this, but I tried it based on the many good reviews I had read.  Now, if only it were just called \\&quot;Curious\\&quot;  without the other part..........</li>
    <li> I actually got this as a present for someone special in my life.  First of all, I don&#x27;t buy perfumes because someone in the limelight puts their name to it.  That&#x27;s for very foolish women.  More importantly I&#x27;m very selective as to what perfumes I buy for others.  Unfortunately for me, I was told that This one is very nasty!!  It&#x27;s mind-numbingly strong, way too floral and it&#x27;s cheap smelling.   The fact that Britney Spears name is on it doesn&#x27;t help either.  The recipient was my Mom.  Even the bottle looks cheap, but it isn&#x27;t.  Too bad they didn&#x27;t try to get Spears name on a perfume before she turned into a skank.  My mom didn&#x27;t keep the perfume.  It&#x27;s somewhere in the Goodwill bin along with the other useless items I had.  I&#x27;m not insulted by all this.  I should have known better.  Somehow I thought it would make her feel younger.  Okay, I&#x27;m just one dumb guy who&#x27;s much smarter now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is more suitable for a younger woman. It&#x27;s not too strong. Just one spray will last all day!! I like it.</li>
    <li> Now a days, with so many celebrities coming out with perfumes, I was very sceptical of just how good Britney&#x27;s would be. But having tried it, I was surprisingly amazed! This of course, had yet to be my first encounter of this scent, for a friend too has told me great things about it. Even I had had the chance in taking whiffs of this scent before having tried it on myself. Perhaps it was because it was rather light at the time, in which I hadn&#x27;t gotten a good enough idea of how it smelled... But it&#x27;s truly great! For a person that hates the smell of flowers, I&#x27;m blown by how much I&#x27;m loving this fragrance! It&#x27;s not very strong at all, rather a light scent which is another plus for me, but stays on without disintegrating to the point in which you must re-apply. It&#x27;s quite lovely, with a hint of a fruity essence. It smells sweet, and loveable, leaving me feeling pretty! I find that I&#x27;m a girly girl; and with this dreamy fragrance, and very cutesie, but classic bottle, I feel oh so feminine!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure that I liked this scent at first; it has synthetic oils and therefore turns on the skin after the alcohol evaporates. Spritzed it on in a department store, but later was in love with the scent. I feel like the  scent was reminiscent of another more low key perfume that I&#x27;ve smelled before, but it&#x27;s captivating in it&#x27;s own right.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loved it.  We seldom agree on fragrances (or much of anything else), but we agree this is dynamite.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had this stuff on and it was HORRIBLE.  Thank God she ditched it and got something that doesn&#x27;t make her smell like Mardi Gras.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to smell like a whorehouse.  Beauty has nothing to do with this garbage.  It has to come from within.  Spend more time developing character and you don&#x27;t have to become a shadow of this sleazy broad.  The guys hate cheap-smelling perfume anyway</li>
    <li> Yes girls, even barnyard animals have better taste than to wear this....(place bad word here).  I got it as a gift from someone who obviously doesn&#x27;t know me and might be history soon.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend gave this to me and it was so bad I sprayed in in the mud in the back garde.  Within hours the weeds were dead!  Yippee!!!  It&#x27;s even better than the poisons that I use.  Now that&#x27;s darned Toxic.  LOL</li>
    <li> I have NO idea whatsoever why my sister would buy A Britney Spears perfume for my birthday.  I&#x27;m in college, smart and pretty.  I&#x27;m also very choosy about what I wear and how I look.  While we&#x27;re very close, my sis knows I&#x27;m particular about wearing perfume.  Mainly because people tend to think they should impose their perfumes on others.  It&#x27;s truly a very personal thing, so I don&#x27;t like heavy-handed perfumes.  This was truly that and more.  I sprayed it on me and couldn&#x27;t get the smell off even after a shower.  It was making me wretched.  My boyfriend complained that it smelled like a funky old lady!!  Of course when we wear perfumes we are judged by how much we wear and what.  It just wasn&#x27;t for me.  I exchanged it for a store credit, determined not to wear perfumes again.  I simply don&#x27;t like the outrageous florals.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this perfume in the mail and wore it one day.  My boyfriend took one sniff and begged me to never wear it again.  He said I smelled \\&quot;cheap.\\&quot;  He asked me what the name of the perfume was and when I told him it was Britney Spears....he said \\&quot;It Figures.\\&quot;  Enough said.  I got this for free and I wouldn&#x27;t wear it again.</li>
    <li> NURSES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WEAR PERFUME....SO THE \\&quot;REVIEW\\&quot; BELOW IS A DEAD GIVEAWAY.  WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS GO INTO ANY STORE THAT IS STILL SELLING THIS SWILL AND SMELL IT FOR YOURSELF.  THEN MAKE SURE YOU ALSO CHECK THE PRICETAG.  DON&#x27;T FORGET, YOU&#x27;RE PAYING FOR BRITNEY SPEARS&#x27; ENDORSEMENT. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I was in a department store a few days ago when a store clerk handed me a card and actually sprayed this one me!!  I choked, gagged and ran for the restroom!  It&#x27;s simply dreadful smelling and overpowering.  When I finally was able to breathe, I contacted a manager to complain.  No one should spray perfume on someone without their permission.  Actually I&#x27;m so happy that stores have sampling areas where you can spray it on small cards yourself.  I would never buy this perfume.  It&#x27;s absolutely overpowering with sweet florals.  Oh yeah, the bottle looks cheap too.  But of course with Spears, it&#x27;s all in the packaging, never the content.</li>
    <li> Even the bottle is cheap looking.  Do you REALLY think marketing anything after Britney Spears is classy??  Enough to spend all that money on it.  One thing guys hate is perfume and lots of it.  Unfortunately females now have to soak in this trashy stuff.  This perfume is miserable to be around, somewhat like when I hear a Britney Spears song, but worse if that&#x27;s possible.  It&#x27;s too strong and too stinky.</li>
    <li> When this first came out, I was in Lazarus and sprayed it on a card. I couldn&#x27;t really make out a clear scent because of my previous perfume samplings. So I smelled of the tester bottle of lotion. From that, it smelled pretty nasty. Well today, I was in Claire&#x27;s and I saw that they sold it in there now. I sprayed it once on my arm and thought, wow, this smells great. The one small spritz is incredibly strong, and every time I barely move I get a humongous wiff of it. The perfume itsself has a great smell, but it needs to be more subtle. The smell of it is now sickening and has given me a headache. I had contemplated buying a bottle while I was in the store, but now I know I can&#x27;t buy anything that would give me a vicious headache after one spritz. I usually wear   3-4 different placed spritzs of Cacherel amor-amor. Never makes me sick. That perfume is quality and well worth its price. This perfume is probably mostly alcohol and sold for a steep price because of Britney Spears named being slapped on it. For something more subtle if you really like this smell, try the shower gel instead.</li>
    <li> I loved this fragrance. However, be warned the atomizer bottle LEAKS!!!! I bought the big one because it was like getting two for just an extra 10 dollars....But It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ll definately buy this again.</li>
    <li> I gotta admit when I first heard about this scent I was completely turned off cause of who made it and didnt really give it anther thought... Till I was at Boscovs and it was on the display counter... I thought what the heck lets see what this stuff smells like and I gotta admit I got over it being a Britney Spears product like that!  This stuff smells so amazing... so if you are like I was and juding this by who made it...  Just give it a try and I am sure you will love it too</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of Britney Spears but I have to say, this is an amazing product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottle it comes - some may say that it&#x27;s childish - in a very simple and elegant bottle. The crystal-like structure and the color of the bottle is rather soothing and has an old, nostalgic feeling to it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful. The other scents by celebrities are questionable and somewhat strange but this scent is truly marvelous. I&#x27;ve smelled True Star(Beyonce), Jessica Simpson, and Paris Hilton but none of those smell as delicious as this. It has a soft scent,and its just wonderful. Its sweet and addicting.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have the bottle and I use it everyday :) &lt;br /&gt;It stands next to my Christian Dior.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Its a reasonable price for this bottle and this scent and I highly recommend it to you and i&#x27;m sure you will not regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Just can&#x27;t find the words.  How about cheap, stinky, cheesy, BAD?</li>
    <li> I got this as a present, hated the scent and gave it to my 80 year-old grandmother.  She loves it.  So, girls, if you want to smell like my 80 year old grandma....you&#x27;ve got competition.</li>
    <li> The thing about Britney is, you either love her or hate her.  A (gulp!) middle-aged femme like me is just not interested enough.  She&#x27;s on the way out, and I figured her perfume would be just as foul as she is (seriously, folks, barefoot in a gas-station bathroom??).  But I must stand corrected, as my valued friend&#x27;s teenage daughters have proved that Curious is the real deal.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole bottle for myself (I actually almost never wore perfume in the past, but recently a like-minded older gentleman has made it mandatory -- and guess what?  I don&#x27;t mind at all.  He often tells me what do, and I have no choice but to obey.  I&#x27;m beginning to think this neo-feminism stuff is for the birds!).  As I was saying, rather than buy myself a bottle, I had my friend&#x27;s daughter pour some into a ziplock bag.  The kind that turns green to let you know you&#x27;ve sealed it.</li>
    <li> I was given this perfume as a present and I have to say it smells great. Sadly, this perfume falsely titled &#x27;eau de parfum&#x27; has zero staying power. Britney, next time you could fill a pretty bottle with water and call it &#x27;deception&#x27;,your new fragrance, something which obviously comes natural to you. PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY, BUY A FRAGRANCE WITH STAYING POWER UNLESS YOU WANT TO USE IT AS AIR FRESHNER. RALPH LAUREN&#x27;S ROMANCE + GLAMOUROUS ARE INCREDIBLE.</li>
    <li> I immediately fell in love with the fragrance, and my husband bought me the really big bottle.  I wanted to savor it, and make it last.  Much to my dismay it turned an ugly pee yellow and now smells like pure rubbing alcohol.  It also formed a nasty, crusty substance all over the pump and bottle.  I am soooo disappointed!!!!</li>
