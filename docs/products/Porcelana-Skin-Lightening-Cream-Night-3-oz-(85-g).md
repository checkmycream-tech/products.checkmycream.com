      <li>I am happy with the night cream.</li>
      <li>It is great for my skin.</li>
      <li>Great stuff as it works for the body and scars for the price I bought 2 or 3 bottles because of the price and at that time the add-on feature.</li>
      <li>This is a great buy for a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>I have already noticed a great improvement.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Compared to the cost of going to a doctor or clinic, this skin lightening cream is a great value.  </li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT&lt;</li>
      <li>im sold and quite happy</li>
      <li>I love it!!  </li>
      <li>Very kind to your skin, but does not take out \\&quot;ol&#x27; lady\\&quot; spots.  </li>
      <li>It is amazing!</li>
      <li>love it, this porcelana cream really is a good one at a very good price.</li>
      <li>The one thing good that came out of this experience is that I now know I can&#x27;t buy anything with hydroquinone in it.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>Seems to have a good review.</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with these products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results in the first two weeks of near-nightly use.</li>
      <li>That is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, a lot of the concerns seem uncertain and under- researched.</li>
      <li>why the 2 star review?&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that this product is effective, it  has a number of health concerns that need to be mentioned..</li>
      <li>I will use the night cream with my own sunblock during the day, because I read the ingredients in the day cream, and I know their sunblock ingredient would be a problem for me.  </li>
      <li>It also smells nice.</li>
      <li>This seller gets it to you quickly and the price is great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more apt to buy from them.</li>
      <li>However, I feel as though these are very important facts to consider when deciding whether or not to purchase this product.</li>
      <li>One trick that works, is for those spots that are in places where the cream is rubbed off easily, use band-aids over the cream; this was an effective way to keep the cream on the spot</li>
      <li>I suggest reading the website campaign for safe cosmetics and educating yourself before buying this product.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I was so glad when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I use on my elbows mostly.</li>
      <li>and there is no need to expose yourself to more hyrodoquinone.</li>
      <li>and hopefully most of the spots will be gone by then.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>i tried many priscibed whitning bleaches and products from macy&#x27;s for over a $150  and no results  </li>
      <li>The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.[5]  </li>
      <li>It is slightly more acceptable if you mix it with your favorite moisturizer</li>
      <li>/&gt;Takes many weeks to find out they say.</li>
      <li>Had been looking for this product in the stores, but none of them carried it any more, so I bought two</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I am HAPPY with the product so far.</li>
      <li>one of the most effective inhibitors of melanogenesis (production of melanin-which too much in certain cells is the reason for discoloration)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>it is true that it has a rebound effect!</li>
      <li>I am glad to receive the product quick.</li>
      <li>so I will continue use as I feel comfortable.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve found that it tends to get gunky when you smooth over your face, isn&#x27;t creamy.</li>
      <li>I have semi-dark elbows and knees are light but not as light as I wanted them to be.</li>
      <li>I have only been using this product for 3 nights and have already noticed great changes in my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I need more time to say something right about that, but I am liking.</li>
      <li>This product smells really baaaaaad!!!</li>
      <li>I am blonde with moderately fair skin.  </li>
      <li>A lucky find.</li>
      <li>Despite the numerous health risks, Hydroquinone is the best known topical skin lightener--</li>
      <li>I was really looking for something that would make my scars disappear; however, this product will greatly lighten scars (I can&#x27;t speak for all scars or everyone&#x27;s skin) with regular use.  </li>
      <li>I would stay away from this product - it&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
      <li>and wow i am impressed everyone can see the difference my face was so dark</li>
      <li>It normally takes 3 months to see any signs of improvement, but for me it isn&#x27;t worth breaking out when I&#x27;m using the product to try to get rid of acne scars ... and all it&#x27;s doing is causing more.</li>
      <li>I had heard that hydroquinone was pretty good for fading both scars and red spots from acne.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t think it, or any creme, could erase the existing sun or dark spots on my face, but it&#x27;s very effective in terms of reducing the visibility of them and you can see the result in a week.</li>
      <li>Reduce pigment significantly in the first 5-7 days.</li>
      <li>I am 60 years old, light skinned, and have always sunburned easily.  </li>
      <li>but I would recommend it to someone that would be happy to just reduce the appearance of scars or uneven skin tone.</li>
      <li>It was worth a try.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>Having worked outside a great deal when I was young, I have a lot of age spots.  </li>
      <li>is it a risk worth making?</li>
      <li>Right now I am scouring the internet to find a website or email for them, just to write and tell them how pleased I am, but so far I have been unsuccessful in finding one.</li>
      <li>When I employed this cream results were great and my spots almost disappeared, but some months after, despite applying 100 spf sunblock daily and avoinding sun, the brown spots came back and darker!!!</li>
      <li>I researched these \\&quot;dark spots\\&quot; and found out it mainly came from sun exposure (increased pigment production in my skin from not using sunscreen -who thinks of that in their 20&#x27;s) and when I asked my doctor he states \\&quot;well your on the birth control pill, you have to expect that\\&quot; -great thanks!</li>
      <li>really WORKS!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure each person is different, but it works for me.  </li>
      <li>and it actually gets a lot better as time progresses</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and will continue use over the next 8-10 weeks.  </li>
      <li>I think they&#x27;ve changed the formula over the years, because I got an acceptable fading the first time, but this time I couldn&#x27;t use it at all.  </li>
      <li>The FDA has classified hydroquinone currently as a safe product, as currently used.[4][6]\\&quot;</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not going to pretend to be an expert on the exact health implications ..</li>
      <li>I noticed results after the first week.  </li>
      <li>as such, most dermatologists are unwilling to discontinue it&#x27;s use.  </li>
      <li>but I think my expectations were higher than they should have been.  </li>
      <li>After only a few days my skin looked much more even and bright--</li>
      <li>personally love this product, hence the reason why i wrote such a length and time-consuming review</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s up to each individual to keep themselves informed and safe.</li>
      <li>I am black with sensitive skin and this product is great.</li>
      <li>I have dark spots all over my body and this has worked amazing.</li>
      <li>Personally, I like to know if something is a highly- suspected carcinogen that&#x27;s banned in most nations before I smear it all over my face and praise it&#x27;s creation.</li>
      <li>I gave a positive review to Porcelana cream some months ago, but now I am coming back to rewrite my former opinion because don&#x27;t want to create karma supporting any kind of cream containing</li>
      <li>The spot on the right side is very light now and much less visible.  </li>
      <li>Microdermabrasion didn&#x27;t do much to help the scars, so I applied Porcelana twice a day (once at night and one during the day).  </li>
      <li>I hope it helps you as much as it has me.</li>
      <li>I have so much scarring</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m going to try to simplify it as much as I can</li>
      <li>My skin seems much softer.</li>
      <li>So if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like mine it may be worth a try.</li>
      <li>It does what needs to be done but its not a product you can really wear under</li>
      <li>After a day my skin was back to about normal with maybe some light peeling in the area where I used the cream.  </li>
      <li>and the cream caused dark itchy spots that did not recover till now after more than a month of stopping it .</li>
      <li>After using many creams trying to get rid of a couple of dark spot/discolorations I bought this one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am glad to receive the product quick. I am HAPPY with the product so far. It is great for my skin.</li>
    <li> I am not happy get what order I received  PORCELANA FOR BALANCED SKILL TONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order Porcelana Skin Lightening Cream, Fade Dark Spots, Nighttime Treatment, 3 oz.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Misc.;</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old, light skinned, and have always sunburned easily.  Having worked outside a great deal when I was young, I have a lot of age spots.  This Porcelana Fade Cream, which I purchased through Amazon, has removed my age spots; but it took six weeks of applications to remove them completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING---do not use this product too aggressively; it is just a bit caustic and will burn your skin if you put it on several times a day for several days. I learned this the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that you apply this cream only once a day, or use it aggressively for a day, and than take a day or two off; this worked for me.  One trick that works, is for those spots that are in places where the cream is rubbed off easily, use band-aids over the cream; this was an effective way to keep the cream on the spot intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the cost of going to a doctor or clinic, this skin lightening cream is a great value.  And it definitely does work, but don&#x27;t expect instant results.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I received the product very promptly, and it was just as described, brand new, unopened, etc. Unfortunately I have very sensitive skin and eyes, so the hydroquinone ingredient that is the main thing that lightens the skin is the one thing that irritates mine. So I was forced to discontinue its use shortly after receiving it, therefore I am not qualified to comment on its effectiveness. The one thing good that came out of this experience is that I now know I can&#x27;t buy anything with hydroquinone in it. So if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like mine it may be worth a try.</li>
    <li> I still have high hopes for this product but thus far, after 2 weeks of spreading a film of the cream each night I&#x27;ve not seen any sort of change. I will continue to use for the 3 months and will write further if I see a noticeable change.  Edited - Nov. 2011  I continued to use this and find it to be a big waste of money. It has not evened my skin tone which is what I had been using it for nor has it lightened my age spots. And I&#x27;ve found that it tends to get gunky when you smooth over your face, isn&#x27;t creamy. I would stay away from this product - it&#x27;s pretty cheap so you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Because it is difficult to find this product in the rural area where I live, I appreciate being able to find it through Amazon.  The service was prompt, so I will most likely purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased Porcelana after I had a severe skin infection on my face that led to acne.  Steroid treatment eventually cured the breakouts, but left me with dark red acne scarring.  Microdermabrasion didn&#x27;t do much to help the scars, so I applied Porcelana twice a day (once at night and one during the day).  It&#x27;s been about three months now and the scars are almost completely gone!  With the progress I&#x27;ve made, I think they&#x27;ll be completely gone within another month.  And my complexion looks brighter and fresher than it did before.  I was surprised, because an age-old acne scar on my cheek that had been there for over two years has also disappeared within the three months, so it&#x27;s not just time that&#x27;s doing the trick.  I love Porcelana for its effectiveness, and because this small jar goes a long way...three months of twice daily applications hasn&#x27;t even used up half the jar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES take a while to notice the effects, so don&#x27;t give up after a few weeks, but keep at it regularly for the full three months!  I recommend using it twice a day, instead of just once at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks and the age/liver spots on my face have lightened.  I had two on the left and one lighter spot on the right side.  The spot on the right side is very light now and much less visible.  The spots on the left have lightened.  My skin became irritated after about 1.5 weeks of consistent nightly use of the product followed by stiff terry-cloth scrubbing with Nivea \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; body/hair wash.  My wife said it looked like I had a burn on my face so I eased up on the skin cream and stopped scrubbing so hard with the terry cloth.  After a day my skin was back to about normal with maybe some light peeling in the area where I used the cream.  I stopped use for a few days and my skin feels fine and the spots seem lighter and lighter so I will continue use as I feel comfortable.  If it weren&#x27;t for the skin irritation (which may be my own fault for scrubbing too hard with the terry-cloth/body wash) I&#x27;d give 5-stars.  All in all I&#x27;m satisfied and will continue use over the next 8-10 weeks.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results in the first two weeks of near-nightly use.</li>
    <li> A doctor recommended hydroquinone for my melasma--hormonal darkening usually caused by pregnancy, but mine just never went away after my kids were born.  I know hydroquinone works for me; I used to use a product from Bath and Body works that had hydroquinone as its only active ingredient.  They discontinued it, and for 4 years since I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of brands and have been getting rashes.  I have super sensitive skin and can get rashy just from using soap or from visiting another state where they have a different form of water treatment.  I tell you... if a product can irritate, I will be the one it will irritate.  I have applied Porcelana night cream 3 times, and already my brown spots are ever so slightly lighter, and there is no reddening!!!!  That is amazing.  I will use the night cream with my own sunblock during the day, because I read the ingredients in the day cream, and I know their sunblock ingredient would be a problem for me.  I am happy with the night cream.</li>
    <li> its so hard to work with spreading it out and rubbing into he skin, you have to pull and tug</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have no idea how effective Porcelana is in fading dark spots because I can&#x27;t stand the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my hands and face and the odor was so unpleasant it gave me an instant headache. I thought the smell might fade with time (like my age spots, I hoped) but half an hour later, I gave up and scrubbed the stuff off. Even now, an hour later, soap-scrubbed and my favorite Dr. Hauschka rose cream applied, the scent of Porcelana is seeping through and making me faintly ill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, because the price is right. Tomorrow I&#x27;m trying Esoterica -- not a bad price either -- to see if I can stand the smell of it, or if it&#x27;s simply the Hydroquinone ingredient that is the curse. We shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve recently learned that Hydroquinoe is cancer-causing and toxic to the human body. No wonder it smells. So, that seals it. They all go back to the store.</li>
    <li> All,   Please be careful and test this product on a portion of your face that you don&#x27;t care about. My wife tried this cream and it caused her to break out almost immediately.  Luckily, no additional scarring occured from the zit.  I would not recommend this product to others. It was worth a try.  I am going to try the Papaya Kojic acid soaps next.</li>
    <li> In searching for a product to lighten dark spots caused by sun damage I found this and almost purchased. But, I like to know what I am putting on my face so I search the main ingredient. This product is banned for use in Europe which should tell us something. It&#x27;s up to each individual to keep themselves informed and safe. See below paragraphs taken from wikipedia. I suggest reading the website campaign for safe cosmetics and educating yourself before buying this product.  \\&quot;In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations.[4] The FDA stated that hydroquinone cannot be ruled out as a potential carcinogen. This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell adenomas. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.[5]  Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin, if taken orally; however, skin preparations containing the ingredient are administered topically. The FDA has classified hydroquinone currently as a safe product, as currently used.[4][6]\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product goes on like paste and does not absorb into your skin. It is slightly more acceptable if you mix it with your favorite moisturizer but it absolutely SUCKS.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 3 nights and have already noticed great changes in my skin tone.  I have really bad dark acne spots around my cheeks that chemical peels won&#x27;t even clear up.  I am applying only to the spots at night right before bed time and after 3 nights I have already noticed a great improvement.  I cannot wait to see what my face will look like in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Porcelana DOES lightening acne scars, BUT it made me break out. So what was the point?&lt;br /&gt;I have skin that can tolerate most skin products, no matter how harsh or gentle. It also smells nice.</li>
    <li> Not real happy with this one was ok but did not do what I was hoping for.  Did not fade the age spots.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had been buying an expensive cream for reducing brown splothces on my hands, but the pharmacy closed and I decided to try Porcelana from Rite Aid.  Every bit as good and much less expensive.  A lucky find.</li>
    <li> Reduce pigment significantly in the first 5-7 days. However, with longer use there is still a faint tint that never completely fade away. Saying that, I feel it is working well.</li>
    <li> I probably should have given this 4-stars instead of 3-stars but I think my expectations were higher than they should have been.  I was really looking for something that would make my scars disappear; however, this product will greatly lighten scars (I can&#x27;t speak for all scars or everyone&#x27;s skin) with regular use.  I was looking for a miracle in a jar which doesn&#x27;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I used this product again?  Probably... if my goal was to lighten existing scars.  I have so much scarring I don&#x27;t think anything would work to get rid of the discoloration in entirety but I would recommend it to someone that would be happy to just reduce the appearance of scars or uneven skin tone.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think it, or any creme, could erase the existing sun or dark spots on my face, but it&#x27;s very effective in terms of reducing the visibility of them and you can see the result in a week.</li>
    <li> I had heard that hydroquinone was pretty good for fading both scars and red spots from acne. Porcelana was a suggested product so I bought it. I started using it at night and a few days later I started to break out really bad. Now granted, I break out from a lot of things, but this is only the second moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever broken out from. I stopped for a couple days and it started to clear up (I use Proactiv). I started using Porcelana again ... and started breaking out again. So I&#x27;m finally stopping and pretty much see it as a waste of $13 (after shipping). It&#x27;s very thick and heavy, so I&#x27;m not surprised it was somehow clogging my pores. It normally takes 3 months to see any signs of improvement, but for me it isn&#x27;t worth breaking out when I&#x27;m using the product to try to get rid of acne scars ... and all it&#x27;s doing is causing more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Porcelana at two different times in my life - to remove summer beach freckles as a teen, and twenty years later for dark spots from infertility hormone treatment.  I think they&#x27;ve changed the formula over the years, because I got an acceptable fading the first time, but this time I couldn&#x27;t use it at all.  I wore it for only fifteen minutes before my skin began to itch terribly.  I knew it was from the cream, and tried to ignore it, but broke out in a rash.  I showered immediately, but the itching didn&#x27;t fade until late the next day.  The store wouldn&#x27;t refund my money because the package had been opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Porcelana gives a decent fading effect, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for those with skin allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am using that a short time, I am liking. I bought and I m using because my cousin used a long time and she loves that. I need more time to say something right about that, but I am liking.</li>
    <li> my mother used this product for years for her freckles and I always watched it work.  Very kind to your skin, but does not take out \\&quot;ol&#x27; lady\\&quot; spots.  lol</li>
    <li> I used it once. and the cream caused dark itchy spots that did not recover till now after more than a month of stopping it .</li>
    <li> Eeeew! This product smells really baaaaaad!!! I have refused to use it, I can&#x27;t stand the smell! Gosh! I wish I could have my money back! I total waste of hard earned money!!</li>
    <li> Just bought it. Seems to have a good review. I will start using it tonight since i only bought the night time one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the night cream for a month now on my shoulders to get rid of some sun spots.  I noticed results after the first week.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product, but my only grip is that it has a bad smell to it.  Also, it is thick and takes a little work to get it absorbed into the skin.  I&#x27;ll continue using it for a few more months and hopefully most of the spots will be gone by then.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. I only used for just 3weeks and I noticed it reduces the dark spots on my face.</li>
    <li> I lucked up and brought both the day and night creams for $1 each. I have been using them off and on for about 2 months. I don&#x27;t do them evey day and when I do its not twice a day. But, they have lightened a scar I had in the middle of my nose trimendously. Its was a very dark scar that you can barely see now. I love this product. I would give it 5 stars except I don&#x27;t know if the scar will come back if I completely stop uusing the product.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding this and then  found on Amazon.  What can you not find on Amazon. Love it. Anyway as for the cream I like it as it seems to lighten dark spots.  I use on my elbows mostly. It doesnt turn them from being dark but lighter.  I have also used on areas on face or shoulders etc. doesnt make things disappear but I do believe it helps lighten.</li>
    <li> So I got a lot of scars from acne and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of them or atleast lighten them. I was getting really impatient and fed up and did a little research before buying anything. This product came up and I usually like to know what ingredients are in the product to see if I have already tried another product with similar ingredients that has failed on me previously. When I looked up the ingredients for porcelana it had an ingredient called hydroquinone. So I did further research into it and there is some controversy about this specific ingredient and some type of cancer inducing effects. But a higher risk is correlated to higher percentage, and porcelana has 2% hydroquinone (which isn&#x27;t bad compared to other prescribed products). I think 2% is perfect because I tried something with 4% and it really irritated my skin-the only issue is that you have to be patient because it really does take 2 weeks for you to see dramatic results, although you will see some progress a week later-but really...2 weeks is not that bad and it actually gets a lot better as time progresses and it helps with future dark spots-so if you really do want your dark spots to fade PLEASE get this product and BE PATIENT!!!!!! Another thing I noticed (I&#x27;m not sure if its correlated to me using the product or coincidence) but my acne did stop-it was weird. And if I did get a pimple or something the scars that come from that acne were little or it didn&#x27;t scar at all. But now back to the ingredient hydroquinone, I talked to my dermatologist and she said that it really isn&#x27;t that dangerous to a person&#x27;s health but she recommends to only be exposed to it for 3 months. If you don&#x27;t see anything after a month or two than the product is obviously not working and there is no need to expose yourself to more hyrodoquinone. The only bad thing is that the product is a bit greasy and sticky-but honestly, I don&#x27;t really care. It does what needs to be done but its not a product you can really wear under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism behind hydroquinone:&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very complicated to explain but i&#x27;m going to try to simplify it as much as I can&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The type and amount of melanin synthesized by the melanocyte and its distribution pattern in the epidermis determines the actual color of the skin-different processes will cause de-pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so hydroquinone&lt;br /&gt;1. one of the most effective inhibitors of melanogenesis (production of melanin-which too much in certain cells is the reason for discoloration)&lt;br /&gt;2. cytotoxic to melanocytes (melanin-producing cells). This means it kills these types of cells. It is not limited to killing these cells it can kill normal cells but the amount that is needed (so the threshold) of hydroquinone for normal cells is a lot higher than the threshold of melanocytes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOPE THIS HELPS YOU MAKE A DECISION AND ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS PRODUCT IS DOING TO YOUR BODY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love this product, hence the reason why i wrote such a length and time-consuming review</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is fading my elbows and knees . I don&#x27;t see any improvement. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks so lets see what happens</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this for my daughter, but she returned it due to, she only likes &amp;#34;Palmer&#x27;s Fade Cream&amp;#34;. So I &#x27;m a BIG&lt;br /&gt;Esoterica fan, but decided to try this again(used it prior), it&#x27;s even worse! It left a HORRIBLE film on my face and it&#x27;s so&lt;br /&gt;oily. I gave it to a friend, she LOVES it!</li>
    <li> This cream has helped me alot, sometimes im out working and also i like to walk outside. My skin colors naturally tanned, so sometimes i get sun spots and i look like a chamaleon. Not anymore using this cream, which has tonned my skin color by the natural color it is, since 2012. Thank you, you guys rock!</li>
    <li> So, I decided to try this product to lighten some minor skin discoloration that I had due to past  acne. After only a few days my skin looked much more even and bright-- Having struggled with my skin for years, it was a relief to see the scars fading.&lt;br /&gt;So why the 2 star review?&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that this product is effective, it  has a number of health concerns that need to be mentioned..&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient, hydroquinone (2%) is banned nearly everywhere besides the United States. The FDA proposed a ban it in 2006 but due to effective lobbying by the American Academy of Dermatology, this effort was abandoned. Despite the numerous health risks, Hydroquinone is the best known topical skin lightener-- as such, most dermatologists are unwilling to discontinue it&#x27;s use.  However, the FDA is still uncertain of it&#x27;s safety and has been actively pushing a proposal to conduct specific studies of hydrouinone&#x27;s effects since 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, this cream lists methylparaben and propylparaben among it&#x27;s ingredients.  Parabens are synthetic chemical additives that are used as preservatives in foods and cosmetics. The safety of these chemicals have been questioned since they were linked to breast cancer studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just been researching these topics for the past day so I&#x27;m not going to pretend to be an expert on the exact health implications .. Honestly, a lot of the concerns seem uncertain and under- researched. However, I feel as though these are very important facts to consider when deciding whether or not to purchase this product. Personally, I like to know if something is a highly- suspected carcinogen that&#x27;s banned in most nations before I smear it all over my face and praise it&#x27;s creation. Unfortunately, I had to fall in love with it before I delved into the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short... yes, this product works well.&lt;br /&gt;But is it a risk worth making? That&#x27;s up to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 15 days and so far I&#x27;ve notice two problem areas reduced in size by 60%.  Two other areas have only lightened up about 15%, but remain the same size.  The directions say to discontinue after 3 months, so it&#x27;s early in the treatment plan.  I&#x27;ll give a follow up report in March.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and always got it at my local walmart.  They stopped carrying it and I was so glad when I found it on Amazon.  This seller gets it to you quickly and the price is great.  I live in California and get a lot of sun just driveing home from work so this product not only bleaches the existing age spots but also is a sunscreen. Never let a day go by without using it and at my age a lot of people do not know how old I really am.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this cream because I had some dark spots on my stomach that showed up after some sun damage. They were embarressing, and because I am so pale, they just seemed so dark and obvious. I bought the night cream at a pharmacy because I happened to see it was on sale for $5. So I figured, why not give it a shot? Today is Wednesday, 8/25/10. I purchased the cream Saturday, 8/21/10, and used it every night since. This morning when I woke up, I happened to glance in the mirror and was shocked at what I saw. The marks are barely visible! Again, this was only after 4 nights. While it was recommended to use the day cream also, I did not, I only used the night cream. I did not expect such results so soon, especially since the bottle said \\&quot;if you see no difference in three months, stop using.\\&quot; So I was expecting at least a month before seeing results. I am totally blown away! Right now I am scouring the internet to find a website or email for them, just to write and tell them how pleased I am, but so far I have been unsuccessful in finding one. When I go home tonight, perhaps I will look on the bottle for a phone number I can call.     The only thing I am wondering at this point is if I will have to use this continually even after the spots disappear. We shall see. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the consistency and pilling of product on my face. I was not able to use it long enough with these issues to get a noticeable effect.</li>
    <li> Great stuff as it works for the body and scars for the price I bought 2 or 3 bottles because of the price and at that time the add-on feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at walgreens a couple of weeks ago. I am black with sensitive skin and this product is great. I use the night cream because sunscreen breaks me out. I use it on my legs, arms and neck; my skin is starting to even out. I&#x27;ve tried other products that cost $135 but broke out and really didn&#x27;t see a difference. This is a great buy for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I saw improvements in my skin withing 1 month! The acne scars disappeared and my skin looks lighter and glowing!. I been using Porcelana night cream for over 7 months now. It also helps my dry skin to stay hydrated (before using procelana my face was very dry, specially in the mornings and winter) and I haven&#x27;t had a break out since 6 months! It is amazing! I love it!!  I also tried using porcelana day cream, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the night time.</li>
    <li> I have had dark discoloration on my face for seven years of my cheekbones and under my eyes that coverd my whole face even of both sides i tried many priscibed whitning bleaches and products from macy&#x27;s for over a $150  and no results  at all i decided to try my moms night cream  that she has been using faithfuly for six months and her face is glowing i tried it four nights ago and wow i am impressed everyone can see the difference my face was so dark and im a lightskinned woman it was so awkward im sold and quite happy im go continue to use it even after the dark spots fade faithfaly even after the deminish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got two spots on my hand that I&#x27;ve been attempting to lighten.  I used the entire jar and have seen no difference.</li>
    <li> I am still in the process of using this, and intend to stick it out the 3 months!  You only need a nickel size, and work on your face, it sinks in!  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I gave a positive review to Porcelana cream some months ago, but now I am coming back to rewrite my former opinion because don&#x27;t want to create karma supporting any kind of cream containing hydroquinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Porcelana cream DID work on me and it was marvelous seeing how brown spots faded when applied on, BUT the bad news came a few months after I stopped applying it on face. Years ago, I used to have really dark spots that looked very bad on a very fair skin after a dermatologist burned my skin with a too harsh solution. The spots went fading gradually as I took care of my skin with 100 spfsunblock, peels and avoiding sun. When I employed this cream results were great and my spots almost disappeared, but some months after, despite applying 100 spf sunblock daily and avoinding sun, the brown spots came back and darker!!! I read it is was side efect of hydroquinone and will never ever apply something containing HQ in. After worsening, I went to apply other stuff and results are permanent and my skin uneven coloration is not worsening anymore. So avoid HQ! it is true that it has a rebound effect!</li>
    <li> I was using this product for some time until I decided to give up on it. I purchased it because of the reviews but once I tried it for myself  I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference like I expected to. I have semi-dark elbows and knees are light but not as light as I wanted them to be. I don&#x27;t really understand why I have dark elbows and knees because I use a body scrubber that&#x27;s shaped like a glove and buffs away dead skin cells. I use this every day, and if I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s definitely every other day. I&#x27;ve done this for years too so I don&#x27;t know. I purchased this and while it did make my elbows lighter it didn&#x27;t help with completely ridding the discoloration. I also felt like it didn&#x27;t work for my knees. I did feel that it made a difference in the texture of my skin. There were some parts of my elbows that felt a bit bumpy or dry sometimes and that helped a lot with keeping it hydrated, I suppose, and smooth. That was a perk. So the reason it doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 stars is because it worked but only half way.</li>
    <li> I like the night cream.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is fading my brown spots on my arms and hands, but perhaps a little.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about three months,it did remove about 30  of the liver and brown spots, to my leggs.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement at all on my hyperpigmentation spots, but i did noticed how it clogged my pores.</li>
    <li> Works as it always has.  I&#x27;m sure each person is different, but it works for me.  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> although I don&#x27;t see any improvement and I no it take a while but I did see a differenc when I wore my fack powder..my face seemed smoother and glowing...</li>
    <li> I bought the day and night creams. My spots started fading in a few days. My skin seems much softer.I used them on my face, neck and chest. I am blonde with moderately fair skin.  I am very pleased with these products.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, this porcelana cream really is a good one at a very good price. i think it is one of the best prodUCTS, I had been using for years. Lightens skin withouT tdamage</li>
    <li> I have dark spots all over my body and this has worked amazing. I put this cream on twice a day and I got results sooner than when I put this on only at night. this cream is pretty thick so a dime to a quarter size amount works well (but it all depends where you&#x27;re using this) and fragrance is very faint, not bad at all.</li>
    <li> I think that says it all!!! I will not be buying any products from Porcelana for that reason. Where as when I hear in the reviews how well a company has treated their customers. I&#x27;m more apt to buy from them. It&#x27;s such a turn off to hear a manufacture won&#x27;t stand behind their product. Porcelana just lost my business.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I used it every night for months and my dark spot never faded. After a while my skin got extremely sensitive from this product so I have since stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for this product in the stores, but none of them carried it any more, so I bought two</li>
    <li> Warning , Warning , Don&#x27;t buy unless you want skin cancer !!!!!!!! Contains hydroiquin - Try the pallid skin whitening cream instead.</li>
    <li> EXPERIENCIA MUY AGRADABLE¡¡¡¡&lt;br /&gt;LE DI ESTA CREMA A MI SUEGRA PARA UNAS MANCHITAS QUE TENIA EN LAS MEJILLAS PRODUCTO DE LOS EMBARAZOS...&lt;br /&gt;Y LE HA DEJADO LA PIEL UNIFORME¡¡¡¡&lt;br /&gt;HERMOSA Y SIN MANCHAS¡¡¡¡&lt;br /&gt;EXCELENTE CREMA¡¡¡¡</li>
    <li> Do not know yet if it fades dark spots on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes many weeks to find out they say. Can&#x27;t tell yet if I like it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It takes a while for it to start making differences. But it does the job!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a week and see no difference.  Perhaps I need to use it longer??  Will try and see.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slow, very slow. It&#x27;s more like regular lotion with small amount of hydro in it. Don&#x27;t expect too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 8/5/2013 Used it for couple month but nothing happens. It like regular cream without any effect but moisturizer. Not recommended. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> I am a 38 year old female who has tried almost every \\&quot;dark spot corrector\\&quot; out there.  I was already dealing with low self-esteem and then I get these large dark circles on both cheek bones (when I say large they cover my entire cheek area!), my chin and most embarrassing of all I got a large dark spot over my entire upper lip so it looked like a mustache!  I wish I would have taken pictures but after trying multiple creams I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this product (I have been trying different creams for months on end for years without any fading). I researched these \\&quot;dark spots\\&quot; and found out it mainly came from sun exposure (increased pigment production in my skin from not using sunscreen -who thinks of that in their 20&#x27;s) and when I asked my doctor he states \\&quot;well your on the birth control pill, you have to expect that\\&quot; -great thanks! I cannot speak for everyone&#x27;s situation but if you&#x27;ve been dealing with this problem without success from other products please try this product.  I started using the night cream only 2 weeks ago and have noticed a dramatic fading of my darks spots.  I am going to start using the day cream also for sun protection.  I cannot thank this company enough for making a product that has helped me be able to look people in the eyes again without thinking they are focusing on all of my dark spots (especially my \\&quot;dark spot mustache\\&quot;).  I truly cannot say enough so please give this product a chance.  I hope it helps you as much as it has me.</li>
    <li> After using many creams trying to get rid of a couple of dark spot/discolorations I bought this one.Let me tell you ,this one really WORKS! I&#x27;ve used it for a month and the darkest spot is almost gone ,plus the appearance of my skin is brighter and even.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!!</li>
