    <li> I love this product I have one on my purse and one on my dresser.</li>
    <li> this produce works great, i really wish it would have been in the box when i opened it. another case of being charged for a product i didn&#x27;t get bin the mail.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for new tattoos! Smells great, heals fast.  I never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This product is pure magic.  In the past my cuts have been slow healing and sometime they get infected.  But since I have been using this product I have healed almost overnight.  Also I had a rash about a month ago and I applied this ointment and it took away the itch. I love it. The only problem is the container,  it is hard to open.</li>
    <li> Very good for small cuts on hands or anywhere.  Heals them w/in a day.</li>
    <li> Disappointed as this is a little too greasy.</li>
    <li> This product works and I have used it for years, purchasing it at Whole Foods where they had bins of it.

    <li> Bruises, scraps, and age spots an all purpose solution!</li>
    <li> While this is a little oily, it has a nice lavender scent. It is a great take along item that goes into a purse or a beach bag. The most important thing is I use it on skin irritations, burns, mosquito bites. It is a general purpose remedy that works on pretty much anything......even bee stings. I used this on a big sting I got at the beach the other day and it helped with both the discomfort, swelling and redness. This is both a good product but also a very convenient one.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey given the quantity but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Received the product right on schedule. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works very well on my extreme dry spots.</li>
    <li> Excellent as a topical ointment for minor cuts, scrapes and especially bruises, we&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> When I had a painful crack at the corner of my thumbnail during the winter, I tried this product.  At the end of the day, I realized that I hadn&#x27;t thought about this little aggravation all day.  I used it again that night and the split was almost healed the next day.  I&#x27;m giving it to friends who garden!</li>
    <li> I personally love the smell!  Some don&#x27;t but I do.  I don&#x27;t feel greasy after I put it on either. Definitely awesome that it is all natural.  I will buy this product again and recommend to others</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  Best chapstick ointment ever - doesn&#x27;t need to be applied every day, like normal chapsticks do!  Bought a 3 pack - one for my purse, office, and home!  Haven&#x27;t tried it on my garden worked cuticles, but will after seeing another person&#x27;s review about having great results with it.  Grandkids don&#x27;t mind it either, helps soothe and heal their owie&#x27;s quickly!</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff, works well on scratches and burns, smells fine and is environmental-friendly. Great for kids and grown-ups! Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product, heals burns and scars. Super fast shipping and great packaging  on behalf of seller.</li>
