<li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure, but this lotion kinda feels greasy (or maybe I am just applying too much???).     </li>
<li> I have tried several over the counter skin creams and they just sort of work but not very well.</li>
<li> My child had dry skin since birth and would breakdown with rash all over body including face and ears.</li>
<li> I am 64, my daughter is 29, both with dry skin and some eczema.</li>
<li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look dry, feel dry or itch!&lt;br</li>
<li> What I&#x27;ve learned is, you have to try them all if you have an issue with dry skin, and this is one YOU HAVE TO TRY if your still looking around.</li>
<li> Since we have been using it, my son never had issues with dry skin.</li>
<li> Perhaps those who found it oily do not have really dry skin like ours.</li>
<li> In some cases, when I&#x27;m wearing dark clothing, it actually causes dark streaks on my skin (where the dye from the clothing sticks to the lotion).</li>
<li> It washes off with water, but if you&#x27;re wearing dark clothing (like long pants) and then change into shorts, it can be a bit embarrassing to have dark streaks on your legs.</li>
<li> My son has extremely dry skin behind his knees and with daily use he has stopped itching and ruining the skin.</li>
<li> I have suffered from a persistent low grade infection in my hands(\\&quot;gardener&#x27;s hands\\&quot;) for several years, and my hands also get dry and cracked in cold weather.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin and in the winter is just gets much worse.</li>
<li> The bad is that this lotion leaves a sticky feeling on my skin that absolutely drives me nuts.</li>
<li> It itches and gets red and it drives me crazy.</li>
<li> but it does have this weird smell that will go away in a few minutes.</li>
<li> The smell&#x27;s not too bad, but it&#x27;s not pleasant either.</li>
<li> The worst oiliest body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <li> She has type 1 diabetes, thus her skin need a lot of TLC.  Bought my first container when she was diagnosed 20 years ago and still use it - I also love it!  It&#x27;s especially wonderful in the cooler months when your skin dries out due to the lower humidity.  It would also be great in areas of the country where humidity is already consistently low.  I live in the SE - but still use it every day after my shower and as I said in the winter when it is needed to counter-act the dry air.</li>
    <li> There are lots of lotions on the market and I&#x27;ve tried a lot but none compare to this one.  For my body chemistry / lifestyle (outdoor hobbies in the wind) this lotion works like no other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I bought the lotion. They are good for the whole family, make our hands smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I have great results&lt;br /&gt;Is a nice lotion to take care of your skin&lt;br /&gt;I just love it&lt;br /&gt;Hardly recomended</li>
    <li> A product u have to try&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just like magic!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried something like this!&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderful&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin even in summer and tried sevral brands or types lotion but didn&#x27;t fit me well. Until I met Eucerin that&#x27;s what I want. Now I can wear short sleeve dressing whenever I need to. Handcream, facial cream,  lip balm are also good.</li>
    <li> I like Eucerin products. I use this lotion mostly before bed. After days of using this, I feel my skin has become smoother. The only cons are:    It says it&#x27;s fragrance-free. Yeah, it does not have a fruity scent but it does have this weird smell that will go away in a few minutes. The smell&#x27;s not too bad, but it&#x27;s not pleasant either. Also, I&#x27;m not sure, but this lotion kinda feels greasy (or maybe I am just applying too much???).     Overall, I will continue using this product because I liked it.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and in the winter is just gets much worse. It itches and gets red and it drives me crazy. I have tried several over the counter skin creams and they just sort of work but not very well. I ask my dermatologists what I should get and she told me to get this Eucerin Smoothing Repair Cream. She said that it is the number one skin cream sold in the USA based on the recommendations of doctors. I am amazed at how well this stuff works. This larger size 16.9 ounce bottle is a good buy as you get four times as much cream for only twice the price of the 4.2 ounce bottle. Here is what I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It moistens my skin all day.&lt;br /&gt;* It has no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;* It thoroughly rubs into my skin and disappears.&lt;br /&gt;* My skin doesn&#x27;t look dry, feel dry or itch!&lt;br /&gt;* It allows my skin to begin to heal.&lt;br /&gt;* It is available over the counter.&lt;br /&gt;* My skin doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after using it as it absorbs in so completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best cream I have found for dry skin and it works well for me. I recommend it as a good product.</li>
    <li> Been searching my whole life for the right lotion for my skin. I have pretty dry skin, hereditary. After coming across this lotion, I&#x27;ve never looked back. What I&#x27;ve learned is, you have to try them all if you have an issue with dry skin, and this is one YOU HAVE TO TRY if your still looking around. This is the only lotion that works properly for me, don&#x27;t need to apply constantly or multiple times. Once a day in the morning, and that&#x27;s it! I know it&#x27;s normal for others without this issue, but it not and an awesome feeling for a guy like me! lol</li>
    <li> I have suffered from a persistent low grade infection in my hands(\\&quot;gardener&#x27;s hands\\&quot;) for several years, and my hands also get dry and cracked in cold weather. I have tried numerous remedies for both problems - everything from antibiotics to Burt&#x27;s Bees lotions, and with the exception of Sweet Almond Oil, none have made much long term difference, that is, until I tried Eucerin Advanced Formula Smoothing Repair Lotion, recommended to me by a doctor I met by chance at a greenhouse plant sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it has made all the difference in the world. The low grade infection has disappeared and the cracks in my hands have almost completely gone away. And this has happened even though I&#x27;m using it at most once a day, and sometimes miss a day. I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> It seems to do a good job of moisturizing the skin, but it also has a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; effect... making clothes stick to the body.  In some cases, when I&#x27;m wearing dark clothing, it actually causes dark streaks on my skin (where the dye from the clothing sticks to the lotion). It washes off with water, but if you&#x27;re wearing dark clothing (like long pants) and then change into shorts, it can be a bit embarrassing to have dark streaks on your legs.</li>
    <li> The worst oiliest body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The product&#x27;s formulas been changed, as I&#x27;d used it before, with an entirely different label. I could lube my truck with it better than using it as a body lotion. Thanks but no thanks to using it again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is is on point and it works well for my skin. I used to put oil on after a bath but not any more.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter ordered this for me off my Kindle, how did she do it? IDK. But I have been using it daily and it is wonderful. My son has extremely dry skin behind his knees and with daily use he has stopped itching and ruining the skin.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001ET7EBO Eucerin Advanced Formula Smoothing Repair Lotion, 16.9 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)]]I bought smoothing repair by mistake instead of regular Eucerin. The best mistake I ever made. I am 64, my daughter is 29, both with dry skin and some eczema. Now our skin is smooth and fine to the touch.

    <li> It was just perfect for my skin especially, during the winter period that I usually esperience itchy,flaky and dry skin when I was using  other types of eucerin. I no longer esperience them since I started using this particular brand.</li>
    <li> Good Lotion for everyday useVery effective for dry skin and yet is gentle and mild. The ski feels sof and pliant. No side effect so far.</li>
    <li> My child had dry skin since birth and would breakdown with rash all over body including face and ears. Our pediatrician recommended eucerine. Since we have been using it, my son never had issues with dry skin. We also use it on our skin and we love it.</li>
    <li> Well I have mixed feelings about this product. First and foremost, the product has my skin feeling smooth, soft, and moist. The bad is that this lotion leaves a sticky feeling on my skin that absolutely drives me nuts. With that said, it works and it works quickly. 4 stars!</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on your skin. I actually use it for my children&#x27;s over dried skin and it helps so much.</li>
    <li> This product is great, and to get 2 bottles at once, means I do not have to worry about runningn out.</li>
