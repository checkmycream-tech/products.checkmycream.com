<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I read on my doctor&#x27;s website a compelling description of the benefits of ferulic acid with vitamin C.  I was reluctant to buy the more expensive product because of reports that it had a foul odor.  I opted for this product and have been using it twice a day for over a month.  I am amazed by the improvement in my skin.  It is softer, very evenly textured, and healthy looking. I tested the product on the back of my left hand for one week and the improvement in skin color and texture was so noticeable that I then began using it on both hands.  The consistency is a bit watery for use with a dropper.  A spray might have been a better bet.  Since the ferulic acid enhances the absorption of the antioxidants into deeper layers of skin, a lighter consistency must be required.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical to try this brand because it was a lot less expensive.  I was impressed with the quickness that I received my order.  My skepticism went away immediately with the first time that I used it.  I will definitely reorde.</li>
    <li> Gives your facial skin instance moisiture and soaks in immediately. Does an excellent job on keeping your face soft as a baby all day long. Worth every penny and a little goes a long way so the price evens out over time.</li>
    <li> I have used skinceuticals and would say this product is of equal quality at less than half the price.  I loved it!!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and the price for the product is good.  Skin seems good but I will have to wait to see the long term results in the next several months.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  It is not greasy.  Soaks right into your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Skinceuticals C/E Ferulic for years and have continued to spend the money on it because I had not found a similar formulation. I was also skeptical about trying this product and while it may be the same formulation it is not the same product and for me, does not provide the same result. That said, I think it does provide some benefit and may be an ok alternative but it isn&#x27;t nearly as thick in consistency as Skinceuticals so I find that I&#x27;m using much more of it to cover my face. I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with the product, I just think that some of the promotion of it is a bit misleading.</li>
    <li> Skin Beauty Solutions Ferulic Acid CE with Vit. C+E Serum is the best!! I am 51 years old and have using this product for about 3 years. It has made a huge difference on my skin. I use this every morning after showering. It works wonders and I even put it on my chest as well. My friends always ask me what I do to my skin. I would recommend this to anyone who is 40 or older. If firms my skin and gives it a nice smoothness (as well as works as a antioxidant against sun damage). I have used the more expensive &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands but this solution by Skin Beauty Solutions is the exact same product at a much more reasonable price. You should definitely try it!! I swear by it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased to say my skin feels smoother and tighter after using this product for just a few days.  Ii hope my skin will continue to improve and that my wrinkles will diminish.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product and arrived as expected. I would order this item again.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to the MUCH more expensive stuff!  I use it daily &amp; especially when I&#x27;m going to be in the sun, to prevent sunburn.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I can see a difference, really evens skin tone&lt;br /&gt;and makes your skin really soft after only 2 wks!  I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;on my third bottle!  I look 10 yrs younger.  Haha  Maybe&lt;br /&gt;five. :)</li>
    <li> I have used another similar product from skin ceuticles but paid over twice as much for their product and seem to receive the same results.</li>
    <li> I usually use the more expensive brand Skinceuticals until I found this Beauty Solutions version of CE Ferulic. I thought it would offer me similar results since the ingredients are comparable as advertised.  I wish I never did! I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin whatsoever with use of this product. After 8 weeks of continued day to day use, no difference at all, not even the slightest bit of reduction in my facial pigmentation.  Most Vitamin C products are suppose to help lighten some discoloration, or unevenness given several weeks time. I wish it would have worked for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for about 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet. May take more time.  I don&#x27;y use it during the day because it&#x27;s kinda sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have  worn it for years!!!  Would not leave home without it.  I am so grateful to Skin Beauty Solution for making it more affordable.  Our finances are not the same, but I can still get this at this price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works as well as the expensive brand at 1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> its ok. didn&#x27;t see results as I have with others</li>
    <li> flows more quickly than a thicker product.</li>
