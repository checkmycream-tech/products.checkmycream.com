      <li>I can buff it onto blemished areas, lightly.</li>

      <li>Good for Use daily.</li>
      <li>This was not sealed like normal and I truely believe these are being sold as &amp;#34;bareminerals&amp;#34; but are filled with something else!</li>
      <li>don;t know if it&#x27;s original, but it&#x27;s ok so far</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money on all there product line</li>
      <li>Try their starter kit and you will love all the bare mineral line.</li>
      <li>I love bare minerals.</li>
      <li>does not cover like bare minerals original from the store, perhaps why so cheap</li>
      <li>comes super fast..</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t care about the features the authentic Bare minerals offers!!!!</li>
      <li>I will be buying more in the future!</li>
      <li>so they can compare because it&#x27;s very visible the difference!</li>
      <li>It feels like there is nothing on my skin at all, even when its hot outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really saved myself ALOT of money!!!!YAY!</li>
      <li>would absolutely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 57 and this gives my skin a pretty glow.  </li>
      <li>I guess you really do get what you pay for!  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>so I can make sure I&#x27;m getting the actual color that I need &amp; pay for.</li>
      <li>This specific product I ordered from this seller does not appear to be authentic.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5-Stars is because I can&#x27;t build up enough coverage to cover my dark under eye circles, but the Bisque works great for that anyway :)</li>
      <li>I have had positive experiences with this brand.</li>
      <li>I have used this for a long time and really love it.</li>
      <li>Once I found the right shade, (Medium Beige Original), I have never looked back.  </li>
      <li>Anyone can easily open the bottom and change out the real stuff with some cheap stuff.  </li>
      <li>the color is SO much lighter then what it appears when i purchase it at ULTA.</li>
      <li>Well I was running out &amp; have relocated and do not have an ulta very close.</li>
      <li>very natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have used bareMinerals for years, this is not the real stuff, it doesn&#x27;t provide the coverage that bareMinerals gives, and doesn&#x27;t feel like bareMinerals.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>; not the real make-up, beware of vendor</li>
      <li>She uses BareMinerals faithfully and she pays so much money for all of the products.  </li>
      <li>and it took so much product to get the coverage I needed.</li>
      <li>It is nothing like the true Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>I received exactly what I ordered, brand new packaging, and it saved me from making a trip to the mall to replenish.  </li>
      <li>In seconds, my skin looks younger and more radiant thanks to the slightest (and not obvious at all) bit of shimmer in the powder-</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I ordered this brush, the foundation and the mineral veil, which normally is over $100.00 at the store she is purchasing from.  </li>
      <li>Also when applied, it leaves streaks that the normal product never leaves.</li>
      <li>For more difficult cover up areas she has to use Revlon or something similar to get a good cover, say, over larger and/or darker age spots.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the same shade as I get at I get at ulta. Seemed to be two shades lighter, even the people at the store when I brought it in said the same thing.</li>
    <li> Perfect shade for my skin tone at a great price! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!! I will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> got this from a woman she loves it</li>
    <li> Not the same color as when you buy from BM. Was lighter.</li>
    <li> I received a knock-off product from this seller. I have been using Bare Minerals medium beige foundation for several years so I am very familiar with the product. This specific product I ordered from this seller does not appear to be authentic. It was the incorrect color and comes out cakey when applied. Also when applied, it leaves streaks that the normal product never leaves. I attempted to return the product to the seller but the seller never responded to me and tried to charge me for the return. I will never purchase Bare Minerals on Amazon ever again and will only purchase from an authorized seller in a store.</li>
    <li> I have been using bare minerals for years.  It is one of the few makeups that I am not allergic too.  Well, I am breaking out with this purchase, so something is definitely different.  Also the coverage is horrible, not nearly the high quality I have come to expect of bare minerals.  My recommendation, you get what you pay for.... buy from a reputable dealer.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff was packaged with something else other than the original Bare Minerals powder.  It doesnt not have the same coverage that the stuff does that you buy from the bare minerals site or store.  Was NOT happy with this purchase and do not plan on ordering this again.</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth, stays on all day and makes you forget you&#x27;re wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like stuff I order off bare minerals site</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BareMinerals for a few years now...  The makeup is great, makes my skin BETTER than before and looks very natural.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5-Stars is because I can&#x27;t build up enough coverage to cover my dark under eye circles, but the Bisque works great for that anyway :)</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time and really love it.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this product was bootleg. It did not perform or cover like the product I typically buy from the retailer. The packaging looks the same but the powder def doesn&#x27;t provide the same coverage.</li>
    <li> I always order from here its great so many wonderful things. Love love love..... this make up.I get it all the time .the price is Great comes super fast..I&#x27;m adidicted. .Thank u...</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals. This make up is the greatest. And ordering it thru amazon I save over $15.00.  You cannot beat that!!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I ordered, brand new packaging, and it saved me from making a trip to the mall to replenish.  This makeup is the best I have ever used, and I have tried other brands.</li>
    <li> Mary has used this exact foundation for more than four years now and loves it. It is light and does not cake. For more difficult cover up areas she has to use Revlon or something similar to get a good cover, say, over larger and/or darker age spots. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, do purchase from a US distributor. I made the mistake of buying this from a dealer in Hong Kong and it took weeks to ship and I ended up having many email discussions with the manufacturer to try to determine it the outlet was legitimate and the product &amp;#34;real.&amp;#34; Finally, I was notified that it was shipped and we received it three or four days later...shipped from Germany. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Loved what I received. Have used this product for a long time. The price was great for the size of container.</li>
    <li> This powder foundation has been my &#x27;go to&#x27; make up for years now. It goes on easy:  no worries about blending a liquid.&lt;br /&gt; It covers enough to make you look good but not made up.</li>
    <li> The color was a little off I was still able to use this well with u mske up</li>
    <li> light weight, perfect! I love how it feels on my face, it&#x27;s like not wearing makeup at all. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using bare minerals for several years, and over the course of these years the price has gone up remarkably! :( so i found this &#x27;medium beige&#x27; budget bare minerals and purchased it....the color is SO much lighter then what it appears when i purchase it at ULTA. also, the consistency of the powder is really lumpy, not smooth and light. i am VERY disappointed, i cant wear the product at all, i look like casper.</li>
    <li> I like this make up the best of any I have ever used but was astounded that this company offered it at 1/3 the cost I normally see.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a good buy. It lets you know wthat the mark up is too high with other companies.</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with this purchase and will certainly re-order.  The price was the lowest I&#x27;ve seen.  I will recommend this to my friends for sure.</li>
    <li> don;t know if it&#x27;s original, but it&#x27;s ok so far</li>
    <li> I have been using BareMinerals for a couple of years now and going to stores to buy it, but buying though Amazon I really saved myself ALOT of money!!!!YAY! In todays economy we all have to save what we can! THANKS Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I could never go back to liquid makeup after using this.  Love it!</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT unless you like fake products of don&#x27;t care about the features the authentic Bare minerals offers!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A FAKE!!!  I have been using bareminerals for 10 plus years and this is a fake version that has some sort of shimmery thick powder filler.  This was not sealed like normal and I truely believe these are being sold as &amp;#34;bareminerals&amp;#34; but are filled with something else! Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Good for Use daily. It is lightweight so you don&#x27;t feel like your face is caked with makeup, it is compact to fit in any makeup kit.</li>
    <li> The best foundation I have ever used! If you have never used this product, it may feel a bit weird on your face, since it&#x27;s mineral powder which is different than any compact powder you may have used. Try their starter kit and you will love all the bare mineral line.</li>
    <li> Since I started using the Bare Minerals foundation I have received repeated compliments on my skin.  Used correctly, this powder offers great coverage without looking like you caked on a ton of makeup to hide imperfections.  You actually look like you have naturally flawless skin.</li>
    <li> The color is not the same as the Medium color.  Medium beige is slightly different, but I hope I will be able to use it in the winter months when my skin tan is slightly less.</li>
    <li> Flawless powder!  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t rest in the creases, folds, and wrinkles brought on by the ravages of life. In fact, I look pretty good. ;)</li>
    <li> This IS NOT BARE MINERALS!! I do not know how you counterfeit bare minerals foundation. But I am 27years old an have wore this exact same color bare minerals foundation since I was 16years old which I always purchase from ULTA. Well I was running out &amp; have relocated and do not have an ulta very close. So with my amazon prime. I figured I would just buy off amazon because I would have it in 2 days. When it arrived it was in the bare minerals container &amp; said medium beige... Immediately after applying I knew it was not the same thing I&#x27;ve used for years! I had a very very small amount left in my old bare minerals container I purchased from ulta &amp; it is very visible it is NOT the same!! It&#x27;s wayyyy lighter then what medium beige should look like. Very disappointed I called Amazon &amp; am returning the foundation &amp; also sending the my old container with very little in it so they can compare because it&#x27;s very visible the difference! I am very disappointed please do not waste your money!!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve been a Bare Minerals user for years, I was pretty disappointed when I got this. I ordered it to match the color I already had and even looked at the labels to make sure it was the right product. The color of this is at least 1-2 shades lighter than the same one I already had. The packaging is identical, but the makeup within is definitely off. Guess I have to go back to the retail stores so I can make sure I&#x27;m getting the actual color that I need &amp; pay for.</li>
    <li> Nice, lightweight coverage.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I compelled to warn people. This was not the same formula! I thought I&#x27;d save some money and order through amazon, but when I got it I noticed the coverage wasn&#x27;t the same! I thought it was just me, but the next day same thing coverage was not there and it took so much product to get the coverage I needed. Next day I went to Sephora to test the product again and the littlest amount of powder covered my skin. I immediately bought a new batch and problem solved.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered the this product and two others for my mom.  She uses BareMinerals faithfully and she pays so much money for all of the products.  I asked her if I could see if Amazon carried what she needed and I found everything she needed.  I ordered this brush, the foundation and the mineral veil, which normally is over $100.00 at the store she is purchasing from.  Amazon had all three for $63, which includes the shipping.  I gave it 5 stars for the price and would give the seller 5 stars as well.  Like I said, it was here basically in 24 hours from the time it was shipped.  I have made my mom an Amazon believer!  Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> I have used bareMinerals for years, this is not the real stuff, it doesn&#x27;t provide the coverage that bareMinerals gives, and doesn&#x27;t feel like bareMinerals. Anyone can easily open the bottom and change out the real stuff with some cheap stuff.  Buyers beware, this is not bareMinerals, go to Ulta or sephorea and by this product, don&#x27;t by it from these guys.</li>
    <li> I have been a BareMinerals foundation wearer for about 8 years. Once I made the switch, I decided it was the last makeup I was going to use. I have had positive experiences with this brand. However, for some reason....the powder that I purchased from this seller is lower quality the the rest of the foundations I have purchased. I received the package sealed and unopened, but for some reason the coverage is not the same. I am unsure if the mineral powder expires over time or something....I&#x27;m not really sure why this has happened....but it is different then all of the other previous foundation packs I have purchased int he past-same shade, same size- for the past several years. I tried it with the same brush and process on half of my face with the same brand/shade from a different seller on the other half of my face and it was clear that for some unexplained reason, the coverage was dramatically different. ?</li>
    <li> Very pleased will order again</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;KNOCK-OFF!!!&amp;#34; not the real make-up, beware of vendor</li>
    <li> seems to be a knock off powder. does not cover like bare minerals original from the store, perhaps why so cheap</li>
    <li> Even though it appeared to be the same, the Bare Minerals foundation I received was definitely not what I have been using.  It offered no coverage and was not of any use.  Since I had ordered two, I gave one to my daughter who also uses Bare Minerals.  She called to ask what was wrong with what I had given her since she said it looked like she hadn&#x27;t used any makeup at all.  I guess you really do get what you pay for!  When I called Amazon to complain, I was told to be careful when ordering from advertised sellers.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this powder, evens skin tone, light, doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the money!</li>
    <li> I have been using BareMinerals Original SPS 15 Foundation now for a couple of years, and I cannot imagine using any other foundation.  I had tried various liquid foundations for years, and was never completely satisfied with any product.  Either the color was off, the coverage was inadequate, or they seemed to give that overly-matte, obviously made-up skin look.  When I did find one I liked, my skin would develop a violent allergy to it after a few months.  I was skeptical to try the BareMinerals, because I had never found powder foundations to give very good coverage, plus they had all the problems I mentioned above with the liquid products.  Once I found the right shade, (Medium Beige Original), I have never looked back.  It is so easy to apply.  I can control if I just want a little coverage or a lot.  I have white acne scars on my jaw, and dark spots on my cheeks, and it covers them all very well without looking made up, and without settling in my fine wrinkles.  In seconds, my skin looks younger and more radiant thanks to the slightest (and not obvious at all) bit of shimmer in the powder- it looks totally natural, like I just have good skin!  The product feels like wearing nothing at all.  Best of all, even if I forget to wash my face at night, my skin feels great the next morning, and after more than two years of use, I have had absolutely no adverse skin reactions.  The 8g size lasts me about 2 months.</li>
    <li> I found this to be okay. I have purchased this product at a cosmetic store for a few years now and found this at on Amazon at half the price. It worked okay but didn&#x27;t seem to be the exact color I purchased at the store and it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long after it was applied.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin when it comes to foundations. I break out very easily with anything liquid! This product however is incredible at controlling my outbreaks. It feels like there is nothing on my skin at all, even when its hot outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
    <li> This is NOT authentic Bare Minerals!  The coverage is not the same, nor does it feel the same.  I have used Bare Minerals for many years and knew immediately this product was a fake.  It is nothing like the true Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> I always come back to Bare Minerals, no matter what else I try. Liquids look mask-ish. Cremes look greasy. Other mineral foundations don&#x27;t give me a natural look. I sometimes mix colors a bit. When I&#x27;ve gotten a bit of sun, I add a tiny bit of Warmth. When I&#x27;m more pasty in winter, I add some &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; - only a little bit goes a long way. Even though I&#x27;m Caucasian and fair skinned, I&#x27;m not pink. I would say I have yellow or olive undertones. Medium Beige is close enough to my natural coloring that I don&#x27;t have to cover my entire face. I can buff it onto blemished areas, lightly. It may seem a bit overpriced, but these powders last a very long time as so little is needed for each application. I probably buy it twice a year, and I&#x27;m a daily user. I did try their matte version and didn&#x27;t like the results. Four stars because this stuff is messy and gets all over everything. (They have improved the packaging in recent years to make it easier to travel with.) Hard to keep the bathroom counter clean and my makeup drawer is covered with various mineral dust. Also, when removing it at night, do so thoroughly if you don&#x27;t want your towels stained.</li>
    <li> This is the best. Makeup line in my option . It is light weight non clogging makeup .  Well worth the money on all there product line</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using bareminerals for years. It&#x27;s a great product for the price. This color is perfect for my skin, an olive complexion.</li>
    <li> The original BareMinerals that I love at a great price!  I love this foundation.  Truly covers, blends beautifully, matches my skin perfectly and no one would guess I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  I&#x27;m 57 and this gives my skin a pretty glow.  I love the mineral veil over it.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals makeup that comes from the store is great. However, the product I received was counterfeit.</li>
