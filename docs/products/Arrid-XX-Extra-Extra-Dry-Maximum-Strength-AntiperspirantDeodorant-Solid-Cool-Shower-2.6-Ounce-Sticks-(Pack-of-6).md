      <li>I love the scent and this deodorant</li>
      <li>it works better than most stuff.</li>
      <li>Easier than spray on, better than nothing on, it does the trick to keep moisture and odor under control with confidence and finesse.</li>
      <li>i have not been able to find this product in store in a while</li>
      <li>Summary, good savings,  fast delivery and easy to do.</li>
      <li>I like cool shower and could not find it that is why I ordered it online.</li>

      <li>gets the job done  and keeps you looking civilized and dry.</li>
      <li>only problem with it is, It leaves a white residue on my clothes, but that is the trade off for being sure I will not perspire.  </li>

      <li>I meant to order unscented, my mistake, I will be a lot more careful next time.  </li>
      <li>6 pack of the old reliable that never lets you show sweat or stink.  </li>
      <li>Deodorant says new package that is not the only new thing it has a different smell.</li>
      <li>Every other antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used had made my underarms itch (including the Arrid &amp;#34;clear gel&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>Given how dry it is, this might be an old expired product.</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have about this product is the white residue left behind; outside of that it is a great buy for the money</li>

<ol>
    <li> Great price for this product</li>
    <li> Easier than spray on, better than nothing on, it does the trick to keep moisture and odor under control with confidence and finesse.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for 25 years. It doesn&#x27;t smell fancy or much at all, but it works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> this is a perfect desodorat</li>
    <li> The only deodorant I use.  Works great, smells great.  Much more affordable than clinical deodorants and works just as well.</li>
    <li> I have a bad odor problem which most deodorants do not control, this is the only one I have found that works. I just don&#x27;t like how it burns when I put it on after shaving. I will probably try to find another deodorant to switch back and forth because I don&#x27;t want my body to become immune like it has with others. I&#x27;ve been using Arrid for about 5 months and haven&#x27;t had any problems yet. I also wish they would come out with more scents!</li>
    <li> what can I say about deoderant?  delivered in a timely manner; good financial deal</li>
    <li> This is actually my least-favorite Arrid XX scent. But they seem to never have the others &amp;#34;Prime Eligible&amp;#34;. I much prefer the Ultra Fresh and Regular, but Cool Shower is a solid third-place. Every other antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used had made my underarms itch (including the Arrid &amp;#34;clear gel&amp;#34;). So I stick to this Arrid XX solid almost exclusively. However, because this uses aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly, it will cause yellow stains on your t-shirts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years. I find it to be the only one that effectively keeps me dry. Not being able to find it locally I&#x27;ve been able to get it on Amazon.com. And with prime shipping I&#x27;m never without my deodorant.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this brand from my local store but for whatever the reason this product or the two that I have opened don&#x27;t have the same smell. When I use the deodorant it doesn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have about this product is the white residue left behind; outside of that it is a great buy for the money and I shall use again.</li>
    <li> Deodorant says new package that is not the only new thing it has a different smell. I like cool shower and could not find it that is why I ordered it online. Im not happy about it but I have it now.</li>
    <li> it was ok, but looked dryed up inside compared to ones purchased at local store.....was look for a bulk discount and a certain scent.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described, fast service!</li>
    <li> So happy to have found Cool Shower, I looked at many stores and could not find them, this was a great deal.</li>
    <li> I meant to order unscented, my mistake, I will be a lot more careful next time.  I received order promply.</li>
    <li> I have used other deodorants but Arrid XX antiperspirant is the only one I can count on to do the job.  Applied in the morning and it last all day.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with it is, It leaves a white residue on my clothes, but that is the trade off for being sure I will not perspire.  I have recommended it to others and they like it also, because it works.</li>
    <li> Only deodorant brand I use!</li>
    <li> Great little product - good service as well - great communication. I would highly recommend to anyone. Thanks for everything.</li>
    <li> Leaves white stain on the clothing</li>
    <li> 6 pack of the old reliable that never lets you show sweat or stink.  Good price and fast delivery are Amazon traits that keep me coming back.  These are not &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; and so you get what you ordered, without the nonsensical warnings about some crazy add-on rule that knuckleheads dreamed up to insult their customers and make them go to Walmart. I love the scent and this deodorant gets the job done  and keeps you looking civilized and dry. Summary, good savings,  fast delivery and easy to do.</li>
    <li> This is not the same scent as the one that is currently in stores (its also white instead of the current blue). This version smells overpowering and not nearly the same as the current version. Given how dry it is, this might be an old expired product.</li>
    <li> it works better than most stuff. The sticks themselves are a lot smaller than i thought but that is bc i just looked at the pictures not the ounces.</li>
    <li> Works so well! My family and running buddies thank you!</li>
    <li> My fiance&#x27;s favorite for the fragrence...not sold so widely in stores anymore so I bought him them in bulk.  He is very particular and loves this stuff</li>
    <li> i have not been able to find this product in store in a while and i just ran out. I ordered 3-6 packs to stock up and will again if they are available in the future. very goo service on the sellers part.</li>
    <li> I am glad i bought this pack.&lt;br /&gt;Hated running out and having to rush down the toiletries aisle just to&lt;br /&gt;stare at the &amp;#34;Out of stock&amp;#34; sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh scent and doesn&#x27;t stain the shirts like other brands.</li>
