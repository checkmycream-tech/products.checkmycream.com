<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It went well and product was exactly what I expected at a good price.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I love this product. It doesnt leave your hair greasy but instead  it adds shine and style!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair which tends to be dry, especially when I straighten it. I was given a sample of this product and couldn&#x27;t get enough of it and decided to finally buy some. This is amazing! My hair is very thin, and this product moisturizes without weighing it down or making it greasy. Great product!</li>
    <li> I searched for this product online trying to find a cheaper price than what my salon sold this product for. I actually loved the Mythic Oil, but my salon sells it for over $30. I placed my order with Neon &amp; Noble online and was very disappointed in the product that arrived. Although the product packaging was the same, the product (oil) inside was not. It is much thicker and is hard to get off my hands. And although it is a very thick oil, I can&#x27;t tell that it does anything to my hair. I will never buy this online. I was warned about buying beauty products on line. Now I know to stay away. It may be a much better price, but beware. It&#x27;s most likely a substitute.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year.  My hair has always been coarse and dry.  L&#x27;Oreal Mythic Oil makes my hair soft and manageable.  Works wonders on my granddaughters tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.  Towel dry hair.  Squirt oil in hands....rub hands together.  Apply to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE L&#x27;OREAL Mythic Oil.  It leaves my hair smooth, silky and frizz free. I tried it at a Salon and found it significantly less through Amazon!  My hair smells and feels terrific!  Highly recommend to all!</li>
    <li> return customer always the best.</li>
    <li> Mythic Oil really deserves it&#x27;s name. Frizz is the definite dealbreaker for curly hair, and this product is the answer. One or two drops, warm by rubbing your hands together, distribute through your hair, and you have shiny curls with no greasy feeling. Do not hesitate, BUY THIS. Additionally, my hairdresser sells this for $32 plus tax. What a bargain here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different hair oils from raw aragon oil to coconut oil, as well as Silk and hair serums.  Above all of those I&#x27;ve tried, this oil works wonders for my hair.  It is almost like a dry oil and it makes my hair supple and shiny without weighing it down or making it look greasy.  My hair never looks as good as when I&#x27;ve put this on.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and it seems light on my hair.  It is the perfect hair oil for me.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product!!!!  I got it as a sample in my December Birchbox and immediately fell in love.  It is so great!  I have thick curly hair and this product just makes my hair so soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy at all like some other serums do.  I will use this product for life!</li>
    <li> stayed with my money and never gave me the product!</li>
    <li> Keeps the frizz out of my hair when it is freshly washed. it also has a great smell which  puts a smle on my face.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing.  Great for fine hair.  Keeps your hair moisturized without and oily or heavy feel.  I have experienced less breakage since using this oil.</li>
    <li> I initally used this product as a sample.  It is such a miracle product on both my hair &amp; my daughter&#x27;s, I knew I had to buy a full size.  After seeing it on salon sites for $30+, I was delighted to find it here for less (thanks again, Amazon!!)  This oil is dry &amp; smells wonderful.  Just a couple drops is all you need before any heat-treatment (blow drying, flat-ironing, etc), and your hair is so silky &amp; smooth.  After a few weeks of use, I find that my hair feels overall healthier.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair oil I have found. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy and is a better option than conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product is terrific to smooth your hair and make it smell wonderful!! I would recommend this to anyone who wants silky smooth hair</li>
    <li> Excellent oil, nourishes the hair ends. Hair easy to comb.</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair. This oil is the best product I&#x27;ve found to keep the frizzies away. Hair is so  soft ans smooth but not greasy.Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I do not like to use products on my hair because I have an oily scalp and wavy, fine hair.  My hair person recommended this to help with the frizzys and dry ends and I was reluctant to try it because it was an oil.  Boy was I ever surprised!  This stuff is so, so light and helps with the frizzys and does not weigh down my fine hair or make my scalp oily.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this! Wish I would have purchased this sooner. It really helps keep the frizzies away and makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> The product shipped immediately. It gives my hair the perfect amount of shine without weighing it down. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> A lovely light oil that gives your hair a beautiful shine without weighting it down</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil.  This is perfect weight. No oily feeling. All other types of oil, my hair feels grimy and greasy at the end of the day. This is perfect and makes my hair very shiny, manageable and healthy.</li>
    <li> Very good! I recommend this product</li>
    <li> this got to me so fast!  thank you!  exactly what i needed!</li>
    <li> Great price and great stuff !!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this - I got a sample of it and after 2-3 uses, I was hooked, and had to buy the full bottle. It leaves my hair silky, soft, and shiny (which is no small feat) but unlike the other products, it does not leave it looking greasy or stringy. I bought mine in Europe and paid twice as much, but even at that price it was so worth the money. It is hands down THE BEST hair smoothing product I&#x27;ve tried (and I tried lots of them!).</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have frizzy dry hair, and this makes it more manageable without making it oily and flat. It also smells good. Expensive, but I use it everyday. That makes it better than products that are cheaper and sit inside my closet until expiry cos they dont do what they advertise.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair with variation in waviness around my head.  I think this product works well to smooth and soften my hair.  It smells nice.</li>
    <li> Always love this stuff, when I can find it. It&#x27;s not heavy or gunky and doesn&#x27;t leave residue in my hair or on hands. It has a pleasant but not overpowering smell and it leaves my hair silky soft, without loading it down with product. Really good for use on dyed hair. Can use it on damp or dry hair. Wish they sold it in more stores.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product and knew I had to get more. Leaves my hair shiny and feeling great without being weighed down. I only wash my hair a few times a week and it lasts.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My hair absorbs the oil pretty quick and doesn&#x27;t look greasy so I really like that! I&#x27;ve been struggling with very dried hair (due to side effects to strong meds that I take) and a friend recommended that I started using this. Her sister is a hair stylist and she has used it as well. Enjoyef it so far even though is only been a couple of days :) Got here super fast.</li>
    <li> This product was used on my hair during a trip to Vegas.  It smells great and works wonders.  I totally recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> My hair was completely fried from letting a friend in beauty school have at it. Started using this on dry and wet hair and my hair has never been softer, it&#x27;s a very light oil and will not weigh thin hair down. Worth the price</li>
    <li> This is a great styling product and one bottle lasts a long time. I dry my hair and then apply a small amount and then style my hair as usual and reapply another small amount when finished. It holds may hair all day and most times I can wake up the next morning and all I have to do is run a comb through my hair. The product seems oily on your hands but my hair never feels oily once dry, just very soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Excellent, reliable and kind</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, great product.</li>
    <li> This oil is great. I don&#x27;t really even use conditioner very often any more. It is a Very good product.</li>
    <li> As I have super-curly hair that is less defined now that I&#x27;ve bleached it all platinum blonde, I&#x27;ve been looking for anything that can quell the serious frizzies as well as give me some smooth definition back to my now fraying curls. Other curly girls that I know had been losing their ish over this product on Tumblr, so I thought I&#x27;d check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t locally available, so ordering it in would have been the course of action one way or another. The price on this is a little bit high but considering it was no where near local, I suppose that&#x27;s neither here nor there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good things:&lt;br /&gt;- It smells really nice. Very light and not too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;- It smooths nicely on hair that isn&#x27;t mine- my sister used it and loved it, and she is a hairdresser who hates L&#x27;Oreal more often than not.&lt;br /&gt;- It did help...some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad things:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s pricey, and good luck finding it in a store&lt;br /&gt;- It did help...some. But with the state of affairs of my hair, it sucked up the serum and then necessitated a new round of it in less than five minutes. It took about six rounds to get it to look any different, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m not taking it out on the product- it was good for what it was worth, and in this case I think the canvas was the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary- if you don&#x27;t have damaged or color treated hair, this might be perfect for you. But if you&#x27;re a curly headed girl who bleaches the absolute crap out of your hair, it&#x27;s not gonna cut it. Save your money and get Perfect 10 or something.</li>
    <li> I thought this product really dried out my hair and made it dull.  It looked stringy and had no shine.  Went back to Argan oil.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair oil. I usually used Argan Oil. The Mythic Oil is better than Argan Oil. Lighter but still effective and with a beautiful fragrance. It leaves the hair smooth and soft without frizz.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing. I have REALLY curly hair and they are firzzy sometime as well. So i apply this at night right after shower and it works amazingly!! It tames my hair and by the next morning my hair looks perfect!! :)</li>
    <li> Great price on the oil as I had paid as much as $40/bottle in a hair salon. Will never do that again...thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizing treatment for dry ends, though I need much more than a few drops for my waist length hair. Smells pleasant too. A friend recommended it and I will do the same. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff in the world.  Always a great deal on Amazon.  The only place I buy this as its super expensive otherwise.</li>
    <li> My salon stylist turned me on to this stuff. I have fine coarse hair and this makes my locks more manageable and tames fizz while being super lightweight and grease free. I also use it before I blow dry to smooth my hair and cut down drying time. I never noticed how much my other hair oils sucked until I used this one. Never going back!</li>
    <li> I had ordered 2 bottles by end of Sep, and they arrived about 10 days later,&lt;br /&gt;its from UK and deliver to HKG, not that fast but ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the really problem is I found out the color of the oil is slightly different between the&lt;br /&gt;2 bottles which I received. Not sure it is the color of the plastic bottle or the oil itself.&lt;br /&gt;And I hope they are authentic!</li>
    <li> I  REALLY  RECOMMEND  THIS  PRODUCT !  THE  HAIR  BECOMES  SHINY  AND  BEAUTIFUL  BESIDES  A  GREAT  SMELL !!!  HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED.  MY  HAIR  CAN&#x27;T  LIVE  WITHOUT  IT !!!</li>
    <li> Dry ends? Rub some of this oil o n your ends before bedtime and wake up to beautiful silky hair! I often dab some of this oil on to my west highland terrier&#x27;s coarse coat of hair and the oil softens it and makes the hair easier to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry, coarse, damaged hair!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, this is magic for dry hair. Love the results. Not a styling aide, but a hair treatment.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this to me. I didn&#x27;t want to splurge at the salon and found it cheaper on Amazon (of course). I love it. My hair is light and silky. I have naturally frizzy untamed hair and this allows me to straighten without damaging it as much!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Great for long hair, makes it more manageable.  can use everyday even a liitle on dry hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It makes my hair so oily.</li>
    <li> I take care of my hair alot. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years now. It detangles, make hair look healthy and prevents split ends. Its just perfect! :)</li>
    <li> smoothes my split, dry ends!</li>
    <li> watery, ust like the other review sis, it is ptobably fake or counterfiet, its those times you should really listen,</li>
    <li> Okay.... let me just this product has changed my hair.  I am trying to grow out my hair.  It&#x27;s a bit frizzy and the layers are longer than normal.  I have curly hair, not kinky though.  I like to straighten my hair too and it takes a while cause there is so much of it.  But using this product makes blow drying my hair quicker, not sure why, but also it is smooth, silky and looks great and lots of body.  I do not need a flat iron.  I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair.  Everyday someone says something flattering about my hair.  If this product seems pricey it really isn&#x27;t when this is the only product you will use.  I can stop using all the other products that I own.  I don&#x27;t need them, I don&#x27;t want them, and I will give them away.  Try this product, you won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> it works well enough for the price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good oil .. Make my hair more soft .. The smell is fantastic . I like a lot</li>
    <li> Love it, and use it daily.  I find that it helps a lot with dry and brittle ends.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy either!</li>
    <li> Good product but I have found others that are the same quality for less money.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Takes out all the tangles and nourishes your hair at the same time. And it smells great!</li>
    <li> May be something out there better- so it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I bought some from my salon (wont do that again, thanks Amazon for the WAY better price!) and it&#x27;s a miracle worker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m growing my hair out to donate, and the longer it got, the more crispy the ends got, no matter how often I was getting my hair trimmed. Mythic oil keeps my hair SOFT, shiny, supple, and manageable. It also works great to protect your hair from damaging heat products. I have naturally curly hair that I dry and straighten almost every day. This oil is so light but really treats the ends of my hair that are so prone to breakage. It also seems that my hair has gotten more and more healthy the more I use it. Definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this item. It was almost $40 at the salon. I purchased it for $15 on Amazon.com. I use it with both wet and dry hair. I have vary long, fine hair and one pump is sufficient for it all! I will never switch to anything else.... L&#x27;oreal continues to be a leader in hair products!</li>
    <li> I am using this as a after shampoo, before drying hair serum. Makes my hair more manageable, gives it a softer and smoother touch. Easy to de-tangle hair after putting this product. Overall I am happy with this purchase, and a little goes long way.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my ombre treated hair. It leaves my hair feeling completely untouched! I&#x27;ve previously used Moroccan Oil (which didn&#x27;t seem to do much expect make my hair feel heavy) -- and I definitely prefer this!</li>
    <li> Makes hair so smoothe but not too oily.  I use this product everyday and apply to wet hair that has been towel dried.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, recommended</li>
    <li> Smells good. Feels the same as other serums. I just really don&#x27;t notice a huge difference with this product. Kinda bummed.</li>
    <li> Got my hair cut in Ireland and got this product which was described as &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34;.  Ran low and found it on the internet - like it very much.</li>
    <li> Basically silicone with a drop of oil and a whole lot of fragrance. Awful.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to blow dry my hair and it always makes it look smooth and feel soft.  It&#x27;s worth the price and the effort to track it down.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend. She always raves about this product and how shiny it makes hair without the greasy look. It&#x27;s lightweight and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. My hair is very fine and &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; usually doesn&#x27;t do well for me. Mythic oil is different and when used as directed does just what it claims to - defrizz, smooth, shine, manageability.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells nice and leaves hair light and full of body with only a few drops!</li>
    <li> Her hair dresser used this and my daughter wanted some for her birthday.  It adds shine and softens her hair.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love this stuff</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and my hairdresser said I order the wrong one that I need the Richer oil. My husband uses this one and he liked it because his hair is more manageable( he has normal hair)</li>
    <li> I have dry hair - and I blow dry it every day&lt;br /&gt;I use just a little of this oil on my damp hair and it makes it a lot easier to blow dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I find that if applied too close to the scalp it makes your hair look and feel greasy. It is definitely great on the end half of your hair and not only makes it look like a healthy shine but it improves the quality of your hair</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see miracle after use. maybe it&#x27;s because I have already have healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture of my hair when I use this product.</li>
    <li> Nice, light weight hair oil. I use it wet and dry.</li>
    <li> My cousin is celebrity hair colorist Andy Cruz, of the Sally Hershberger salon in Los Angeles, he recommended this too me. It&#x27;s great for all hair and especially nice for color processed hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product and it costs $30 to buy it from my salon...light and has a great scent</li>
    <li> best product I ever found that leaves my hair soft and shiny. not heavy, absorbs quickly. Still leaves my curls or waves (depending on the day&#x27;s style). Actually makes it easier to comb my hair. I have a lot of hair that is very thick &amp; curly. It used to be a bit frustrating (even a little painful) to comb it out in the mornings. now I just use a little before and combing &amp; styling is much easier. A little goes a long way and it leaves a nice shine without weighing down my hair.</li>
    <li> Mythic Oil is the best product I&#x27;ve come across for styling my hair.  Used sparingly, it always leaves my hair soft and shiny and never greasy.  My hair tends to be a little frizzy at times and this really controls it well.</li>
    <li> My hair is no longer frizzy! I think I&#x27;ve used every product on the market, but this oil is the best. I use it with the Nuance sea salt spray, for perfect beachy waves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll describe myself and hair first&lt;br /&gt;31 years old, half Japanese half Caucasian, I live in an extremely humid environment (Oahu, Hawaii), with very long, fine, slightly wavy hair, split-hair central, dyed dark brown&lt;br /&gt;I use Tresemme Keratin Smooth as my shampoo &amp; conditioner (the conditioner is a miracle worker)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was pretty decent looking before getting Mythic Oil, but because it is so fine it often gets tangled, and I find that it sometimes looks a little dull. I did a lot of research until I finally settled on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;1. My hair looks really shiny (not in that greasy way, it looks *healthy* shiny, like I&#x27;m 15 again) I&#x27;ve actually had several people (two strangers even) ask me about my hair&lt;br /&gt;2. It is so bouncy! I&#x27;m not talking about curl-bounce, just looks a lot healthier and full of life (yes I know hair is dead)&lt;br /&gt;3. My hair is also nice and smooth, my favorite is when I just get out of the shower and run it through my damp hair, it feels like silk and there are ZERO tangles.&lt;br /&gt;4. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t need to use a flat iron or blow dryer after this, though I was never big on using those sorts of things, I tried out the flat iron this morning and my hair looked like I just stepped out of the salon. It stayed that way all day.&lt;br /&gt;5. It is really cheap. That&#x27;s why I do so much research. I want to find the best possible product for the least amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is though it has a pleasant &amp; mild smell, it isn&#x27;t a fragrance I would choose to wear myself. I guess I&#x27;d describe it as...grapeseed oil, orange blossom maybe? slight hint of vanilla...I usually favor lightly sweet-fruity/floral scents and I am generally obsessed with having my hair smell amazing so I&#x27;m a little bummed about that. But, hey, I look better than ever and now my boyfriend can enjoy running his fingers through my hair. Before he&#x27;d always get caught in those nasty tangles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, my only tip would be is don&#x27;t use too much. My hair runs down to my butt, I separate it down the middle and run one pump on both sides (2 pumps total) and make sure hair is freshly towel dried. I&#x27;d imagine it would cause hair to be weighed down or have a greasy appearance if you used too much or used it on dry hair. Stay about an inch from the scalp if you have an oily head...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, my only tip would be is don&#x27;t use too much.

    <li> Tried this at my hair salon and they wanted 2x the amount of money - this was a great deal and arrived quickly - excellent product and will buy from again!</li>
    <li> Love love love it! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Frizz control without the weight.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It leaves your hair every time like you come out of salon. Non greasy which I like very much. Wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I normally have an oily scalp and cannot use many products, but this one seems to be ok. This is the best smoother I have used in a long time..... and I have natural curly hair living in the humid GA. This really works on keeping the friz from going nuts. I really like the smell too. :):)</li>
    <li> This works great for my thick and full hair.  It really prevents frizziness and keeps my hair smooth and much more manageable.</li>
    <li> Love the Mythic Oil for my hair!  A little goes a long way for shine, manageability and the end of frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;This is double the price in the hair salon!  buy it NOW.</li>
    <li> I bought two L´oreal Mythic Oil, one for me and one for a gift. I liked very much and so does my friend.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. I works great it and it smells great. I use it EVERYDAY.  I have very thin, soft, semi-curly hair that is very frizzy if not tamed this product isn&#x27;t oily after it dries and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> I have very long thick dry coarse hair. This mythic oil changes its texture. I apply it before I blow dry. I have to use a lot the product. However, it takes my frizzy hair and makes it soft and silky. I can extend my blowout an extra day by adding a little mythic oil in between. I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Moroccan oil from target. Not the same at all.</li>
    <li> My Stylist introduced me to this product a couple of weeks ago, my hair had some serious damage and with my new cut and this product (what a turn around!!!).  I love it so much when she put it in my hair, loved the way my hair smelled and felt silky and much, much healthier!!! I Love it!! No need to put on a lot, one little drop on your palms, put on your hair, massage through your hair and presto!! It has a better smell than the other big 3 letter brand.  Although it is pretty pricy at the salons, I managed to find me an excellent deal on this site.  Would certainly recommend.  You have a customer for life L&#x27;oreal &amp; Amazon!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it !</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily or heavy, it gives it an amazing shine! Helps a lot if your hair gets fizzy and smells like heaven :)</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in a luxe-box and instantly fell in love.  I&#x27;ve tried various hair oils, and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel super greasy.  It&#x27;s weightless and really feels like I don&#x27;t have any product in my hair at all - it&#x27;s just silky smooth and smells heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for months now and the bottle isn&#x27;t even half empty, and I use 2-3 &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; each day.</li>
    <li> This product is great with my hair.  My hair is naturally curly, so it helps keep it smooth on days I straighten it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it after every hair wash, only on the ends. I haven&#x27;t had split ends or any other hair damage ever. I either flat iron or curl my hair all the time. At first, I bought it at my salon for $38!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Been a long standing consumer. Delivery was before expected date.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before and loved the way it feels on my skin. So, I actually buy it for my skin. The fragance is light and feminine.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s salon has been using this product on her hair for a couple of months and with the great results we decided to purchase it for her to use at the house. A little goes a long way!!! She takes multiple medications and the tends to dry out her hair, but this product brought back a shine I haven&#x27;t seen in a very long time. I highly recommend this product for anyone that has dry burnt hair.&lt;br /&gt;JW</li>
    <li> I use this on my children&#x27;s hair. . .works great on my child&#x27;s thick, wavy, long hair and takes the tangles out without crying.  Leaves their hair soft, smelling great and very manageable.</li>
    <li> My stylist is always trying new products out, which I kind of hate, but this one is a big winner!  This is the product you need if you like the idea of the Argon and Moroccan oils, but find they can be too heavy or weigh your hair down.  I have somewhat dry, wavy hair that is course and hard to work with unless I use products.  This really tames flyaways, and also protects it from heat styling.  It smells amazing, and lasts quite a long time for such a small bottle.  I sometimes put this in a small spray bottle to spray rather than rub through my palms and it&#x27;s light enough to do that.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily expect this product to repair damage I have currently, but it does keep it light, shiny, and smooth once your hair is healthy.  This is one of the few products I will not be caught without anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this oil it makes my hair smooth and shiney every day I basically depend on it and I usually spend $45 on it at the salon. So worth it to get it from amazon</li>
    <li> Wow!  This stuff is fantastic!  I have long (mid-back length) naturally blonde, unprocessed hair that is slightly wavy and neither thick nor thin.  It can be blown straight, but if there is any humidity it waves up a bit.  I live in Florida, so I rarely blow it straight and usually leave it slightly damp because why waste time fighting the humidity?  I would never win that battle.  My waves are uneven -- some are loopier and other parts tend toward kinks, not waves.  I gave up years ago trying to make all the waves perfectly even or pretty (waste of time!); now I am just happy when things are shiny and relatively under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always tangled easily and been oily at the scalp and drier towards the ends.  I was initially afraid of putting oil on my hair, as I figured that it would just make things a big greasy mess.  I was wrong.  Really, really wrong.  This stuff is &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil, which means that once it is on your hair it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave things greasy.  What it does, however, is leave hair shiny, manageable, healthy and easy to get a brush or comb through (finally! No more tangles!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, after shampooing and conditioning I use a small amount of a different product at the roots to give my hair lift and then I use a pump of Mythic Oil on the rest of my wet hair.  I then blow dry and if I need a little bit more Mythic Oil to control fly-aways and leave my hair smooth and shiny.  I always pump it onto my hands, rub them together well and then try to evenly distribute the oil through my hair.  My hair has never looked healthier or better; instead of weighing my hair down this tends to give it shiny, bouncy body -- as long as I don&#x27;t use too much.  I am thrilled with this product and will definitely be purchasing more.  And I have told all my friends about it, too, because a good hair day just plain feels good.  I LOVE that this makes having a good hair day pretty effortless.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! Smells great! My hairdresser used it on my hair one day ( I usually don&#x27;t like the products they put in my hair) and I loved it. I had been using Kiehl&#x27;s silk serum. L&#x27;Oreal is just as nice or better and it&#x27;s cheaper...good find...worth the $$. I liked the shampoo and conditioner, too.</li>
    <li> This product is the best ever!!!!! It makes your hair soft, it smells amazing, it tames the frizz. Everyone should buy it.</li>
    <li> This product works excellent as a smoothing oil. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, you can even apply it to dry hair (not too much of course!)</li>
    <li> I ordered Mythic Oil and the picture showed &amp;#34;nourishing oil&amp;#34; but I received the rich oil, so I had to return the product. Disappointed</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It smells great and not too greasy. I am not sure how much it is stopping my frizz. I do like this product and will continue use it. My hair feels softer.</li>
    <li> made my hair so healthy</li>
    <li> It is very good to use and makes my hair more smooth. It has many uses such as for styling hair or put during damp hair.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this product and I really like it. My hair does not feel heavy due to using several products. This moisturizes my hair and leaves it feeling good.</li>
