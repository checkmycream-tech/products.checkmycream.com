      <li>Arrived quickly, feels good on skin</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps creams to absorb better or not.</li>
      <li>Just received this product yesterday so I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term aspect of this product, but I love this thing.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not so sure</li>
      <li>I love the cooling effect the jade has on the skin-</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s both a pick-me-up and refreshing.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i need to do more research</li>
      <li>/&gt;Package arrived safe and on time.</li>
      <li>light tto apply any effective pressure</li>
      <li>It does feel nice and cool on the face, though.</li>

      <li>This is a beautiful little tool, cannot see how the higher priced rollers would be any better made.  </li>
      <li>It is so cool and calming.</li>
      <li>I keep mine in the refrigerator all the time so that it will always be cool when I want to use it.</li>
      <li>I sit down at the kitchen table and do my massage so that I can enjoy all of the coolness of this massager, you can do this as many days of the week that you want because it does not injure the skin in anyway!  </li>
      <li>This is a great small face massager.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no difficult task at all, I do it before bedtime when I&#x27;m reading a book or watching a movie.</li>
      <li>Amazing little tool.</li>
      <li>would not recommend as the whole thing squeaks</li>
      <li>I also gently use it on my eyes.</li>
      <li>husband uses it as much as I do&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I also use my natural facial oil then roll it over my skin to work it in better and evenly, as well as giving it a cooling effect.</li>
      <li>Originally, the first one came in two pieces, the handle broken in half, but the seller was very kind and sent me another to replace it.</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller (Luos Cultural Goods), they told me it is real jade</li>
      <li>A fun buy, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>They are so cheap and convenient when you need a facial but don&#x27;t have time or enough money.</li>
      <li>:) I don&#x27;t roll it over my eyes, you&#x27;d have to put too much pressure on such delicate skin for that, but I do rest it under the eye area, and it feels so good on tired eyes (resting it against eyelids).</li>
      <li>Not sure if it will do any good but was used by therapist at last facial.</li>
      <li>Anyway, it looks like natural stone instead of man-made material.</li>
      <li>if it helps with any skin lightening, it has made my face soft looking though.</li>
      <li>My face has always been soft but now it has this smoothness to it like a baby&#x27;s face after using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very tan as I have a mixed ethnic background</li>
      <li>This is a nice little roller and it is little.  </li>
      <li>I feel silly doing it, but it feels nice.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a difference in overall toning, but so far I like what it does for me.</li>

<li> very small too small to use professionally.</li>
<li> I use it in the AM/PM and it helps with any tight muscles along my jawline.</li>

<li> and I usually roll it for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li> but I broke the wire and use crazy glue to fix it.  </li>

    <li> The roller is bigger than I expected and is well made. But the material feels like marble instead of jade. I contacted the seller (Luos Cultural Goods), they told me it is real jade but the quality is low. Anyway, it looks like natural stone instead of man-made material. For the price you can&#x27;t complain. Oh, it does feel good when I use it on my face.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but I broke the wire and use crazy glue to fix it.  Its bearly holdng.</li>
    <li> Love these products! I&#x27;m totally in love with jade rollers! They are so cheap and convenient when you need a facial but don&#x27;t have time or enough money. The &amp;#34;jade&amp;#34; cold feeling on my face is just lovely and I usually roll it for about 15 minutes. It&#x27;s no difficult task at all, I do it before bedtime when I&#x27;m reading a book or watching a movie. I wake up feeling as if my pores have been pampered and softened. My face has always been soft but now it has this smoothness to it like a baby&#x27;s face after using it. I&#x27;m very tan as I have a mixed ethnic background so I&#x27;m not so sure if it helps with any skin lightening, it has made my face soft looking though. Kinda like when someone Photoshops your face lol</li>
    <li> Handle fell out during shipping and we had to get a wooden dowel to replace it. Other than that my wife likes it.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to gal pals and they loved it!  Great for applying serums and creams, or just massaging.</li>
    <li> It feels so good against my face and neck.. It also have made my skin softer since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Who knows? Maybe it will work. If nothing else, it&#x27;s well made.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it will do any good but was used by therapist at last facial. She recommended so thought I would try it.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I imagined (no longer than my pinky). However I must say that this does feel really good to roll on your face and neck. I feel silly doing it, but it feels nice. A fun buy, especially for the price. I don&#x27;t think I could have purchased an equivalent amount of raw jade from my local rock shop for the same price as this well carved and put together roller.</li>
    <li> great for relaxation and its pretty&lt;br /&gt;my husband uses it as much as I do&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> Originally, the first one came in two pieces, the handle broken in half, but the seller was very kind and sent me another to replace it. I love the cooling effect the jade has on the skin- it&#x27;s both a pick-me-up and refreshing. :) I don&#x27;t roll it over my eyes, you&#x27;d have to put too much pressure on such delicate skin for that, but I do rest it under the eye area, and it feels so good on tired eyes (resting it against eyelids).

    <li> very small too small to use professionally. would not recommend as the whole thing squeaks</li>
    <li> very smooth and cool to the touch. rolls well on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little roller and it is little.  The roller is about one inch long.  Still does the job.  Wanted to try one out before I bought a bigger one.  I&#x27;ve since bought one with a two inch roller on one end a  one inch roller on the other end.  It does seem to be smoothing out my face plus it feels good when your roll it on your face.</li>
    <li> this tool is really wonderful for skin.</li>
    <li> Just received this product yesterday so I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term aspect of this product, but I love this thing. It just feels like a nice massage and feels cool on your face. It is WAY smaller than I expected but I got over that fact after rolling it all over my face. Even our dog liked it :) I&#x27;m ordering another for my boss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what this is supposed to do, but what it does for me is relax all my facial muscles!! It is so cool and calming. I love it!</li>
    <li> The size I recived was the small one that only works for eyes, but I expected the bigger version according to the selling picture. It was not worth my shipping cost to return it so I kept it but never used it.  Btw the jade looks cheap, look nothing like the selling pictures.</li>
    <li> Excellent for soothing the skin on the face and neck at the end of your day. I keep mine in the refrigerator all the time so that it will always be cool when I want to use it. After using your toner or astringent on your face and neck, use this massager over your face and neck for about 4 to 5 minutes. Wait until you have completed the application of your toner or astringent on your face and neck, only then do you remove your massager from the fridge. I sit down at the kitchen table and do my massage so that I can enjoy all of the coolness of this massager, you can do this as many days of the week that you want because it does not injure the skin in anyway!  CAUTION: Massager should not be placed in the freezer under any circumstances!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful little tool, cannot see how the higher priced rollers would be any better made.  As to results, that needs time to prove.  It does feel nice and cool on the face, though.</li>
    <li> Excellent for forehead wrinkles, eye wrinkles, for face blood circulation. Refreshes the face, eye bags.  Good for headache and for relaxing too.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful but it&#x27;s a tiny little thing. I was expecting it to be a bit larger.</li>
    <li> This roller feels really nice . It&#x27;s cool and pleasant to use. I use on my forehead,it relaxes me.I don&#x27;t know if it helps creams to absorb better or not.I don&#x27;t care about that...</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, feels good on skin</li>
    <li> Price is good, jade is nice but is squeaks when rolled. Stays nice and cold then warms as heat is pulled from the skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing little tool. If feels so great to massage my face with it. It has become part of my daily beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived safe and on time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> A little squeaky when it rolls.</li>
    <li> i find it a bit useless&lt;br /&gt;too light tto apply any effective pressure&lt;br /&gt;i need to do more research</li>
    <li> This is a great small face massager. I use it in the AM/PM and it helps with any tight muscles along my jawline. I also gently use it on my eyes. I love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect fast and good product</li>
