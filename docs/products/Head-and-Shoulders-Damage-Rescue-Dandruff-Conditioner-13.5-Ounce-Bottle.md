      <li>This products smells so good.</li>
      <li>Nice scent too, not all chemically like some brands</li>
      <li>Works good, but leaves my hair a bit oily on top.</li>
      <li>I was ecstatic quite honestly, as it was quite embarrassing every time I would scratch my head or remove my hat.</li>
      <li>Does its job and smells nice.</li>
      <li>This bottle lasts longer since he doesn&#x27;t need to use as much to be effective.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it because the smell was overpowering - a very strong orange-citrus sort of scent.  </li>
      <li>So I am glad they came out with a nice conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Great conditioner that leaves your hair smooth and smelling fresh</li>
      <li>Now I can use my favorite shampoo and use the Head &amp; Shoulders conditioner for my dandruff maintenance.</li>
      <li>Love the product and will order again.</li>
      <li>Donated it to our Kitchen pantry - I&#x27;m sure someone enjoyed getting it.</li>

      <li>-in One shampoo and the Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo is a bit strong.  </li>

      <li>It also smells good and leaves hair soft</li>
      <li>This stuff is just as good as the regular H and S and smells much better.</li>

      <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really care about the &amp;#34;damage rescue&amp;#34; and really couldn&#x27;t refuse the price (thanks to the coupon!)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Packaging wise, when I receives the item, it was individually sealed in it&#x27;s own bag so that in the event that there was leakage (there was not), it would not get the other items in the package wet.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other types of &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoos/conditioners (T-Gel, reg. head &amp; shoulders, clinical) and none really have worked too well.</li>
      <li>but I have damaged, dry, and extremely fine hair.</li>
      <li>Remember, only use the shampoo at most 2-3 times a week, as it will dry your scalp severely.</li>
      <li>After a few days of using both, my hair had finally become silky smooth and the flakes disappeared!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a big relief since I have that type of luck normally.</li>
      <li>Was surprised at how soft this actually made my hair!</li>
      <li>Now, I only use this one everyday and the shampoo twice a week, to help maintain the clean look.</li>
      <li>If you are having the same problems that I have had, I highly recommend picking up this and the extra strength shampoo.</li>

<li> Yes, I can buy a knock off at the dollar store, but it is always poor, thin quality and dries out the hair like.  </li>
<li> I have horrible dandruff at times and i use this for a few days amd</li>

    <li> I have horrible dandruff at times and i use this for a few days amd it takes it away. It also smells good and leaves hair soft</li>
    <li> This products smells so good.</li>
    <li> Happy with the quality and the price</li>
    <li> Very good product. Shipped quickly. Works very well. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I swear by Head &amp; Shoulders shampoos. The way Amazon shipped this, it arrived in a cardboard envelope which was unexpected, and the cap was broken so some of the conditioner was leaking out, Not cool. But it has a hint of a good smell and makes my hair really soft so it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Great head and shoulders product. Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t weigh thin hair down. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Ordered this conditioner as a subscribe and save item with a coupon.  Was a great value at the price!  Since only my husband uses this brand in our house, I tend to never know when he is out, so subscribe and save is great and makes me look like a rock star when he never runs out.  .  This brand never disappoints.  Yes, I can buy a knock off at the dollar store, but it is always poor, thin quality and dries out the hair like.  Head and shoulders does not!  This bottle lasts longer since he doesn&#x27;t need to use as much to be effective.  Smells great and does not leave a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging wise, when I receives the item, it was individually sealed in it&#x27;s own bag so that in the event that there was leakage (there was not), it would not get the other items in the package wet.  That&#x27;s a big relief since I have that type of luck normally.</li>
    <li> Here in the desert of Arizona everything dries up! You can bath in lotion and your body will still be thirsty. This includes your scalp. Thus was the case with me. I had just moved to AZ and I needed something to moisturize my scalp and get the dry skin off. Thats all that dandriff is: dry skin. Never had dandriff before but if you grew up in the USA then you know where to reach if this is your problem. After the 1st. wash, along with a dandriff conditioner,  my hair felt thoroughly clean. When I brushed my hair there were no flakes after the 1st. use. I have made this product a part of my routine. Its a very nice shampoo, lathers well and it WORKS!</li>
    <li> Helps my scalp feel great and my hair feels soft and lovely. Nice scent too, not all chemically like some brands</li>
    <li> Excellent, as always.</li>
    <li> Removes dandruff and the smell is very nice! I wanted a nicer smelling dandruff shampoo since I had been H and S big bottle from Costco for years and was getting tired of the &amp;#34;medicinal/bland&amp;#34; fragrance. I figured I would give this a try. I didn&#x27;t really care about the &amp;#34;damage rescue&amp;#34; and really couldn&#x27;t refuse the price (thanks to the coupon!) This stuff is just as good as the regular H and S and smells much better.</li>
    <li> Works good, but leaves my hair a bit oily on top.</li>
    <li> As of the past few years I have developed I severe dandruff problem. I have tried many other types of &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoos/conditioners (T-Gel, reg. head &amp; shoulders, clinical) and none really have worked too well. I took a chance with this product and the Extra Strength for Men Dandruff Shampoo. After a few days of using both, my hair had finally become silky smooth and the flakes disappeared! I was ecstatic quite honestly, as it was quite embarrassing every time I would scratch my head or remove my hat. Now, I only use this one everyday and the shampoo twice a week, to help maintain the clean look. If you are having the same problems that I have had, I highly recommend picking up this and the extra strength shampoo. Remember, only use the shampoo at most 2-3 times a week, as it will dry your scalp severely.</li>
    <li> Amazing easily de tangles my hair in the shower and leaves super clean and moisterized . I loooove this product!</li>
    <li> For me it has not helped my severe dandruff problem.</li>
    <li> Donated it to our Kitchen pantry - I&#x27;m sure someone enjoyed getting it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  I don&#x27;t like the All-in One shampoo and the Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo is a bit strong.  So I am glad they came out with a nice conditioner.  Now I can use my favorite shampoo and use the Head &amp; Shoulders conditioner for my dandruff maintenance.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders the only shampoo and conditioner I can use and works for my itchy scalp.  Fast Shipping! Good Deal! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This works as a conditioner should, that&#x27;s not the issue.  I couldn&#x27;t use it because the smell was overpowering - a very strong orange-citrus sort of scent.  Once you put this on your hair it won&#x27;t smell like anything else for days.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner that leaves your hair smooth and smelling fresh</li>
    <li> Was surprised at how soft this actually made my hair! I don&#x27;t have dandruff so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but I have damaged, dry, and extremely fine hair. It&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that adds moisture without completely weighing down my hair. This is it! It becomes plush and shiny while remaining weightless.</li>
    <li> Does its job and smells nice.</li>
