      <li>I used to use the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair lotion but find this product is much better for the price and the results thus far!</li>

      <li>Nothing performs miracles, but this stuff is really good if you use it consistently over a long period of time.</li>
      <li>I am a 56 year old woman, fair complexion, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It does make a very positive difference in the wrinkles on my face.</li>
      <li>I put it right up there with the Clarins eye cream I use.</li>
      <li>noticed a bit of a tingle when first started using, but I got used to it.</li>
      <li>If you use it twice daily, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>As long as you don&#x27;t mind smelling like a hippie, you&#x27;ll be OK.</li>
      <li>I give this a 9/10 for lasting so long and being a good value.    </li>
      <li>I strongly suggest using any product from Olay Total Effects or Regenerist lines.</li>
      <li>I actually am looking into other ROC products right now as Ive heard that they are good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m virtually certain</li>
      <li>Goes on very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I am now using the whole Roc line.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am brunette and didn&#x27;t really get any wrinkles until I hit my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I use this around my lips it really diminishes the look of lines.</li>
      <li>and I really like what it does for my skin</li>
      <li>I really do recommend this product and all the others.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I bought the RoC Retinol Correxion, Deep Wrinkle Serum a month ago after reading the good reviews it received from other consumers.  </li>
      <li>Since other products have worked better for my skin than this one, I never repurchased it.</li>
      <li>I found out that Retinol was a key ingredient to look for and I am looking to diminish fine lines and prevent new ones.</li>
      <li>I have an olive complexion and try not to spend too much time in the sun (I do live in Arizona however)</li>
      <li>It is more plump and tight.</li>
      <li>But, since I have been using it a little longer, I am extremely pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>you are of an age when something of this nature might be useful, I can recommend this specific product without qualification.</li>
      <li>Not knowing the age, or skin type of the other fine reviewers</li>
      <li>but there are two deep wrinkles right where my eyebrows meet my nose</li>
      <li>so I do have the fine lines and several deeper lines especially on the forehead and between my eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>I paid $23 for the bottle and expected it to last more than 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>Like the other reviewer said on here &amp;#34;It actually made more wrinkles&amp;#34; It added to my skin problems.</li>
      <li>It does firm skin and smooths out small wrinkles within the first week of use, but it doesn&#x27;t work that great at erasing the deeper wrinkles that inevitably create crows feet.  </li>
      <li>The area directly under the eyes is particularly sensitive and perhaps it is better to only apply the serum every other day.    </li>
      <li>I bought this based on all the positive reviews it had gotten on various websites.  </li>
      <li>such a possibility is mentioned in the product insert or on the box.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully every night for about 3 months after I use ROC Daily Resurfacing Disks and there is a definite, tangible, measurable improvement in the texture of my skin and the appearance (which to me is *presence*) of several areas of fine wrinkles, including under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It smells like something from an herbalist or natural medicinal line.</li>
      <li>Is the coloring the result of expired, old, toxic skin   product?</li>
      <li>This product seems to work well on my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>but this product makes my skin soft.</li>
      <li>Well, my skin is far from &#x27;radiant&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>but if you have naturally oily skin you might want to reconsider...</li>
      <li>It has a natural glow to it too.</li>
      <li>I like the night cream combined with the complete lift serum.</li>
      <li>I will tell you that I am 44 years old.  </li>
      <li>This stuff changed my face completely.</li>
      <li>But my skin absolutely looks 10 years younger than it might.</li>
      <li>It &#x27;does&#x27; burn, so if you are sensitive this product is not for you.</li>
      <li>I use this daily, and I can really tell a difference in my skin -</li>
      <li>I usually put it on every night and sometimes in the morning, but now always, on dry fresh clean skin.</li>
      <li>While I can understand what the other reviewer felt when she said it burned, I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It does slightly burn when you use it, but most every other retinol or vitamin A based product does as well.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, ok though the amount of retinol may be too little</li>
      <li>combination of products is the only thing that has produced visually identifiable, quantifiable improvement.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe I expected to much.</li>
      <li>They are less expensive, gentle, and effective.</li>
      <li>I am careful to use it only once a day in the morning and to use another product that is very nourishing at night.  </li>
      <li>Products that lean toward more natural ingredients always have a weird color or scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a 56 year old woman, fair complexion, sensitive skin. This works for me, it&#x27;s as simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it will feel like it&#x27;s burning from time to time. I&#x27;m virtually certain such a possibility is mentioned in the product insert or on the box.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully every night for about 3 months after I use ROC Daily Resurfacing Disks and there is a definite, tangible, measurable improvement in the texture of my skin and the appearance (which to me is *presence*) of several areas of fine wrinkles, including under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have used every product I could lay my hands on from extreme high end to the clearance bin at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;This combination of products is the only thing that has produced visually identifiable, quantifiable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Do I look 35? No. But my skin absolutely looks 10 years younger than it might. People have commented on my [apparently, not actually] wrinkle-free skin.&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#x27;s not cosmetic surgery. No, it&#x27;s not laser resurfacing. But it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique. That&#x27;s why there are thousands of brands of everything. This brand in this combination works for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you are of an age when something of this nature might be useful, I can recommend this specific product without qualification.</li>
    <li> I like a lot of RoC&#x27;s other products, but not really this one.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months, with no noticeable improvement and it always burned the skin around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just trying RoC or are thinking about trying this, I&#x27;d try out the other products instead of this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this is getting low reviews from anyone. Because of the smell? I admit it was a little off-putting at first, but personally I&#x27;d rather wear something on my face that is LIGHT, natural and actually \\&quot;soaks in\\&quot; than some heavy creamy crap that smells like chemicals or is full of synthetic \\&quot;oils\\&quot; that aren&#x27;t \\&quot;supposed to\\&quot; clog my pores (but do anyway). Products that lean toward more natural ingredients always have a weird color or scent. So do a lot of the less natural products, but they&#x27;ve got fragrance added to mask it.     This stuff changed my face completely. I had no idea there was anything that could do this. It took two weeks, I put it on in the morning (under makeup) and put it on my \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; at night (around the mouth, forehead and eyes). The skin under my eyes did feel a little sensitive for a week or two, but never once did I \\&quot;look worse\\&quot; or have irritated skin.</li>
    <li> No problem with seller at all but extremely drying and irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> I seem to get pimples from this. Other than that, ok though the amount of retinol may be too little</li>
    <li> This stuff works. The wrinkles around my eyes have become less noticeable, and my forehead creases are reducing slightly. Like other reviewers, it seemed like it made the bags under my eyes worse for the first two weeks, but they improved after that. The area directly under the eyes is particularly sensitive and perhaps it is better to only apply the serum every other day.    The serum&#x27;s fragrance is noticeable, but not unpleasant. It smells like something from an herbalist or natural medicinal line. As long as you don&#x27;t mind smelling like a hippie, you&#x27;ll be OK.</li>
    <li> I actually am looking into other ROC products right now as Ive heard that they are good. I bought this on sale. It did not work.Like the other reviewer said on here &amp;#34;It actually made more wrinkles&amp;#34; It added to my skin problems. With all fairness my skin may not taken to it.</li>
    <li> I bought the RoC Retinol Correxion, Deep Wrinkle Serum a month ago after reading the good reviews it received from other consumers.  Not knowing the age, or skin type of the other fine reviewers I was just hopeful that it would work for me...sadly it hasn&#x27;t seemed to make any difference in my wrinkles whatsoever.  I will tell you that I am 44 years old.  I am brunette and didn&#x27;t really get any wrinkles until I hit my 40&#x27;s.  I have an olive complexion and try not to spend too much time in the sun (I do live in Arizona however) so when I do go out into the sun of course I use sun screen. I only have wrinkles on my forehead but there are two deep wrinkles right where my eyebrows meet my nose (on each side, I don&#x27;t have a uni-brow just yet:) that make me look like I&#x27;m always scowling.  Anyhoo, I have been applying the serum to my forehead every day, twice a day for about a month now and nothing has happened.  Nada, zip, zilch, zero, difference.  I still have my DEEP wrinkles on my forehead and the two DEEP wrinkles above the bridge of my nose.  In fact I would say that the added moisture to my skin has kind of made it more oily thus causing breakouts...YUCK.  So I continue to look like an angry brunette (I look angry because of those nasty wrinkles between my eyebrows) and I&#x27;m out $20 bucks (including shipping).  I would say if you have dry skin this couldn&#x27;t hurt because at least it will moisturize but if you have naturally oily skin you might want to reconsider...unless of course your partial to adult acne.</li>
    <li> I like it, although it does not have the same smell or consistency of the previous RoC deep wrinkle serums.</li>
    <li> I would be very careful when using this product. I washed my face, and applied to skin. I actually felt a sensation of burning, I immediately washed it off. Days later I noticed it burned my skin, its like a rough patch of dry skin, actually made my skin worse than it ever was before. So be very careful wth this product. I threw mine out.</li>
    <li> Yes the scent if off-putting. That didn&#x27;t help me fall in love with this product. I did, however, like the lightness of the fluid &amp; ease of application. While I initially thought the bottle is small, I was suprised at how long it lasted. I like that it&#x27;s an opaque glass bottle that protects the contents better than any plastic bottle could.     That said, I found this product didn&#x27;t do much for my skin (late 30&#x27;s, sun damage, some stress lines &amp; wrinkles beginning to form). Since other products have worked better for my skin than this one, I never repurchased it. For those whose skin responds well to this product, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I use it in conjunction  with the Vitamin C serum.  I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It does make the skin smoother, but did not remove the sun damaged skin.  Maybe I expected to much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week. I know it&#x27;ll take weeks to see results but this product makes my skin soft. I love the feel of it. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> While I am not too sure my winkles are better (need more time) I like the smoothness of my skin where applied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of RoC products, and a lot of them have very weird, strong scent to it, like herbal medicine or something sort. This one also has strong smell, so I didn&#x27;t enjoy putting it on my face. In terms of the result, it did not achieve any of the things that are advertised/promised. No improvement in skin tone/firming or reducing wrinkles. Rather, it was too harsh on the skin and it caused my cheek to turn red with irritation and neck skin to peel off...I stopped using after a number of tries. I&#x27;ve stopped using all RoC products, and now I am using Olay products. I strongly suggest using any product from Olay Total Effects or Regenerist lines. They are less expensive, gentle, and effective.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! It gives skin a beautiful, smooth finish!</li>
    <li> While I can understand what the other reviewer felt when she said it burned, I have pretty sensitive skin and I loved the results.  I am careful to use it only once a day in the morning and to use another product that is very nourishing at night.  It does make a very positive difference in the wrinkles on my face.</li>
    <li> I had researched a bit before I bought. I found out that Retinol was a key ingredient to look for and I am looking to diminish fine lines and prevent new ones. I am in my 20&#x27;s and as a nurse, I know that is is easier to prevent than it is to heal or reverse a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a bit of a tingle when first started using, but I got used to it. I usually put it on every night and sometimes in the morning, but now always, on dry fresh clean skin. Along with a healthy diet and lots of water, this product will help fight the effects of aging and leave you looking as young as you feel.</li>
    <li> Great, awesome product for middle aged skin.  Definitely works as it says.  Will never use anything else but Roc products. Beckie Goudy</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years. A lot of stores in my area do not carry this......as a result, I have been ordering it though Amazon. No hassle, shipping and Roc is always available. Thank you very much !</li>
    <li> I have seen a brightening glow and tighter skin. It &#x27;does&#x27; burn, so if you are sensitive this product is not for you. All retinol products burn. It means it is working.   It takes some time to work. I didn&#x27;t see a difference for 3 wks.   I will,  however try other products. Still searching for &#x27;the one&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for almost two weeks now and I am lovig my skin. It is more plump and tight. It has a natural glow to it too. I have noticed a difference with wrinkles yet because I think it needs more time. My skin is peeling a little bit I know that is expected with use of retinol. I am now using the whole Roc line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post an update soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the positive reviews it had gotten on various websites.  I chose the serum rather than a cream so my pores wouldn&#x27;t clog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 weeks now.  I use the product daily 5x a week.  My skin is tender, peeling, and my pores are clogged.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is happening since retinoids are supposed to help CLEAR your pores, not clog them.  Obviously since my skin is peeling, I don&#x27;t see any actual skin improvement.  According to the Roc website at 4 weeks, my skin is supposed to be radiant and it takes up to 12 weeks to see any improvement in wrinkles.  Well, my skin is far from &#x27;radiant&#x27;.  I&#x27;m going to stop using this.</li>
    <li> Absorbs fast and easy for a smoother looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;With regular use, it softens and deminishes wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Easy spray applicator.</li>
    <li> I am a Roc fan and this is one of my favs.&lt;br /&gt;Good price 💕</li>
    <li> I have always considered Amazon the way to go when purchasing a product you want to try but are not sure about and don&#x27;t want to pay the pharmacy/discount store prices without a coupon!  I was not disappointed at all in this product.  I read all the reviews I could over the past few months and finally purchased it at a much lower price here.  I have been using it 2 x day, especially before bed and I have had alot of compliments on how fresh my face looks lately.  I am 55 so I do have the fine lines and several deeper lines especially on the forehead and between my eyebrows.  I am completely satisfied with this product and will purchase it again here on Amazon.  I used to use the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair lotion but find this product is much better for the price and the results thus far!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable results in a week. You will love it.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have talked about this before. But, since I have been using it a little longer, I am extremely pleased with the product. I use it a little differently as I only have deep wrinkles on my forehead and around my mouth. After I have done all the cleansing, and either used my night cream or day cream. I take a very small brush and I place a small portion in my hand. I take the little brush and sort of paint the serum into the frown lines and around my mouth and pat it in.  I am already seeing a difference in the deep lines. I&#x27;m a retired Nurse, so I always read what is in the product I am using. Many of them relate to the working part of the product, and the rest are just preservatives.  No waxes or fillers.  I also use it on the back of my hands and cuticles at night. My hands were beginning to look like our Dalmatian with a lot of liver spots. But, they are slowly getting very pale. Remember your hands can give away your age.&lt;br /&gt;Fonnie</li>
    <li> This serum is retailing for $21 to $23 or even more in most drug stores, so the price on Amazon ($17) is great... in addition, I got free shipping by ordering two bottles.    Not too long ago I read in the NY Times that a lot of folks won&#x27;t use products containing alpha-hydroxy because there is an initial reddening of the skin.  It is apparently one of the few skin care ingredients that gives measurable improvement, and I can vouch for that.  I put it right up there with the Clarins eye cream I use.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. If you use it twice daily, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results. I&#x27;ve tried many higher-priced department store products in the past, but this is the best.</li>
    <li> I bought a 1oz bottle of this in 2006 and I just ran out of it in late 2010.  I used a small dab of this Roc Serum about 4-5 times a week, just under my eyes.  It does firm skin and smooths out small wrinkles within the first week of use, but it doesn&#x27;t work that great at erasing the deeper wrinkles that inevitably create crows feet.  It does slightly burn when you use it, but most every other retinol or vitamin A based product does as well.  I actually need a stronger retinol product now it seems.    I give this a 6.5/10 for making the areas around my eyes look younger.  I give this a 9/10 for lasting so long and being a good value.    If you need firmer looking skin around your eyes and want to diminish small lines, this serum should do the job.    I plan to experiment with some stronger retinol products, but if they don&#x27;t work, I will repurchase this serum again and increase my daily dosage.    Update:  I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Moisture and Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer for only a week and have have almost erased my deeper eye wrinkles in just 5 days...pores around my nose are very small now too, and color on my face is balanced out now too.  My face skin is smoother, firmer and youthful now.  These are much better retinol products than the Roc products.</li>
    <li> Is this product supposed to be an offensive dark yellow color? I&#x27;ve only seen one other skin moisturizer with a dark yellow / brownish hue, and it was just as scary and repulsive. Is the coloring the result of expired, old, toxic skin   product? I would reason so. If the lotion is supposed to be white, then the product was very long past the \\&quot;sell by\\&quot; and a complete and obvious rip off. If it&#x27;s supposed to be the dark yellowish brown color...then the manufacturer&#x27;s blunder, but I doubt it. This purchase was completely useless, gross, and irresponsibly shipped. I have not yet thrown it away, if the vendor is at all concerned about quality, health, and safety, I recommend the seller \\&quot;recall\\&quot; the product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of this product, use it all the time and have noticed a softer, more supple skin tone</li>
    <li> I find ROC Retinol Corrextion Deep Wrinkle Serum lessens the appearance of my deeper wrinkles; between my eyes and the lines to each side of my nose-to-mouth. I also had some pores, that had long closed over debris, open up and let the gunk out. This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist who said this non-prescription retinol product works.  I am a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face daily.  With or without make-up my skin looks healthier.  I use several RoC products.</li>
    <li> I use this daily, and I can really tell a difference in my skin - It&#x27;s clearer, smoother, and softer.</li>
    <li> Although I plan to try this serum, I did not purchase this it. But I did purchase the night time anti-wrinkle cream. I like the night cream combined with the complete lift serum. Seems to do as it claims. thank you and look forward to purchasing again.</li>
    <li> The serum goes on smoothly and I really like what it does for my skin</li>
    <li> Has taken many fine lines away. Goes on very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Very soft and feels good when I apply.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many and this is the BEST!!</li>
    <li> This product seems to work well on my sensitive skin.  Everyone may not be able to use it on the eye area.</li>
    <li> liked it ..it does what it says</li>
    <li> Great product been using it for 5 years love it.</li>
    <li> I use this around my lips it really diminishes the look of lines. Ive tried a lot of other products but this one  works best</li>
    <li> burnt my skin and left redness and dry patches - very uncomfortable and my skin is a mess!</li>
    <li> If you are expecting miracles, you won&#x27;t find it with this serum. I can&#x27;t tell anything.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results just after two weeks of use.  I can see my skin is more smooth and the lines are diminishing.  The only issue that I have is that the bottle only lasted two weeks.  I paid $23 for the bottle and expected it to last more than 2 weeks.  Perhaps more than once ounce would be better for the price...........hint, hint.</li>
    <li> This product works great and was much cheaper on Amazon than at the local stores.  I&#x27;ve used it for several months and can tell a difference.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Roc serum twice a day for years.  I believe it helps to keep my skin firm.  Nothing performs miracles, but this stuff is really good if you use it consistently over a long period of time.</li>
    <li> I am 85 and look at least 10 yrs younger and I am your best publicist.  cant afford it in a practical sense but I call it a necessity.  so 5 stars it ismy daughter uses it and my doctor is starting to use ROC.  I really do recommend this product and all the others.  If you have any coupons I would appreciate it.</li>
