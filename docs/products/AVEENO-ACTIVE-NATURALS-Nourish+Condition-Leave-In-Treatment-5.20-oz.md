      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I would of been better off just stickin with the pricer \\&quot;its a 10\\&quot; nourish treatment than this.</li>
      <li>I have tried several and this works the best</li>
      <li>Not greasy, but light and nourishing.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, detangles my super long tangly hair.</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair soft and silky and so easy to manage.</li>
      <li>It smells great and definitely improves the way my hair looks after using a blow dryer and a flat iron!</li>
      <li>Another thing I like is that the ingredients used in Aveeno are not questionable (parabens anyone?)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this conditioning spray!!</li>
      <li>Makes my hair super soft!!</li>
      <li>very natural on hair can keep shorter hair in its place while felling soft not like most jells</li>
      <li>My youngest daughter also has my very fine, dry hair.  </li>
      <li>Nice, shiney, not weighed down or greasy.</li>
      <li>Makes hair silky and more flexible when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
      <li>This really helps to calm the frizz down and de-tangle, way better than salon stuff.</li>
      <li>it breaks so much because it gets tangled.</li>
      <li>I really hope I never face the day when this stops working for my hair.    </li>
      <li>I have fine hair, and dry hair, and curly hair ..</li>
      <li>and I can easily glide a comb through my wet hair.</li>
      <li>This is fabulous if you have processed or dry hair.</li>
      <li>And the salon suggestions have been for that super skinny solution stuff that is TOTALLY not what I need for her hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been using the Aveeno on my hair for a few months and loved how it made my curls stay in place without frizzing out, and made brushing after the shower simple.  </li>
      <li>It rather makes my hair coarse rather than than clean and soft.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and silky, and is much CHEAPER when purchased on line.</li>
      <li>Love this Aveeno hair product.and have had trouble finding it..</li>
      <li>The price here on Amazon with Subscribe &amp; Save, and free 2nd day shipping with Prime, makes the price per bottle cheaper than my local Wal-Mart (which amusingly is right next door to an Amazon.com facility).</li>
      <li>I have very fine, dry hair that I blow dry almost every day.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is exactly the same</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and have much success with other aveeno products</li>
      <li>I spray it on right before I blow dry my hair.</li>
      <li>but since it is pricey decided that i would try this instead since i loved the other aveeno products i have gotten in the past.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months now and it always leaves my hair manageable while brushing, soft, and moisturized.</li>
      <li>The conditioning aspect leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Found it first at Target when I was looking for other Tigi products.  </li>
      <li>Not oily at all, very smooth smell, doesn&#x27;t leave hair heavy or stiff...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands but this is the only one that really works.</li>
      <li>I wanted this to replace the other expensive hair product that i loved</li>
      <li>It is also light enough that even though I have fine hair it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down unless I get too crazy with it.</li>

    <li> Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s rat&#x27;s nest hair!!!  It actually is a de-tangler that WORKS!  Don&#x27;t even get me started on the ones that I have tried that don&#x27;t work.  We would be here all day.  And the salon suggestions have been for that super skinny solution stuff that is TOTALLY not what I need for her hair.  Just overpriced failures.  USE THIS! IT WORKS! Buy lots of it so they will keep making it.  Otherwise, I will cry.  My child will cry and it will be sad.</li>
    <li> I expected a dry shampoo product. This product does not nourish or condition my hair. It rather makes my hair coarse rather than than clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and love it.  I have very fine, dry hair that I blow dry almost every day.  This product is excellent for detangling when sprayed on damp hair and it&#x27;s fantastic for styling and anti-frizzing after drying and styling.  The conditioning aspect leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, thick and hard to comb after washing/conditioning. This leave in conditioner works SO well! This product works as well as any that I have paid $$$ for from the salon. It doesn&#x27;t even take a whole lot (even for long, thick hair), so the bottle goes a long way. It smells great and definitely improves the way my hair looks after using a blow dryer and a flat iron!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and dry hair, and curly hair .. which means my hair gets tangled and frizzy simply by moving wrong.  My youngest daughter also has my very fine, dry hair.  Brushing her hair usually involves tears, yelling \\&quot;ow\\&quot;, and much frustration.  I&#x27;d been using the Aveeno on my hair for a few months and loved how it made my curls stay in place without frizzing out, and made brushing after the shower simple.

    <li> The Aveeno leave-in conditioner is a great product.  I recommend it for all hair types.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months now and it always leaves my hair manageable while brushing, soft, and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even express how happy I am with this! Just buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it. Just a few sprays and I can easily glide a comb through my wet hair. Nice, shiney, not weighed down or greasy. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Found it first at Target when I was looking for other Tigi products.  It&#x27;s a GREAT conditioner, and easily gets out the tangles.  Leaves hair soft and silky, and is much CHEAPER when purchased on line.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good value. Excellent transaction.</li>
    <li> very natural on hair can keep shorter hair in its place while felling soft not like most jells</li>
    <li> My hair is colored and very hard to comb out after shampooing.  This product makes my hair soft and silky and so easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff! I used to buy it at cvs/rite aid but I can&#x27;t find it there anymore! This stuff is exactly the same and it is awesome. Smells amazing, detangles my super long tangly hair. GREAT!!</li>
    <li> This is fabulous if you have processed or dry hair. I used to get my hair permed and colored, and it would get burned every so often, sometimes from styling it. This really helps to calm the frizz down and de-tangle, way better than salon stuff. It is also light enough that even though I have fine hair it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down unless I get too crazy with it. Makes hair silky and more flexible when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product. I spray it on right before I blow dry my hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and have much success with other aveeno products but i bought this thinking that it would not make my hair feel like straw and condition it. With even the least amount sprayed into my hair it very much felt like straw. I wanted this to replace the other expensive hair product that i loved but since it is pricey decided that i would try this instead since i loved the other aveeno products i have gotten in the past. I would of been better off just stickin with the pricer \\&quot;its a 10\\&quot; nourish treatment than this. This aveeno product did not even define my curls, it just make it look stringy. WIll not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it!! This is the best detangler! Makes my hair super soft!! Smells fantastic!! Highly recommend this conditioning spray!! AAAA ++++</li>
    <li> Started using this over 2 years ago.  It sprays in and stays.  Not greasy, but light and nourishing.</li>
    <li> I have been using these treatment for years! It&#x27;s great for detangling hair. I have long, superthin hair and it breaks so much because it gets tangled. This treatment makes it look shiny and helps basically leave less hair in the comb... I need to use it always! I&#x27;ve tried other brands but this is the only one that really works. Not oily at all, very smooth smell, doesn&#x27;t leave hair heavy or stiff...</li>
    <li> Love this Aveeno hair product.and have had trouble finding it..but this was a great deal and now I have plenty to use for awhile.diana.b</li>
    <li> Love it I have long hair and it get the tangles out! I have tried several and this works the best</li>
    <li> It is what I was looking for my hair, and it smell delicious. Everyone said this, and I have recommended it.</li>
