      <li>I used this product, in my favorite tanning bed, and my legs looked authentically tanned (no &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; appearance) !</li>
      <li>Product is amazing.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell</li>
      <li>I think the smell is nice too and was recommended to try from a friend,so all in all a winner.</li>
      <li>so I thought that for once, I&#x27;d like to have some skin color since I&#x27;ve always been kind of pasty despite my Hispanic heritage.</li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I was able to track my package on line too.</li>
      <li>and I can tan OK from the hips up -</li>
      <li>Be sure to moisturize before application</li>
      <li>I love Matahari</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more like a \\&quot;rosey\\&quot; tan.  </li>
      <li>I really loved this product - it worked really well for me.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is great for quick results!!</li>
      <li>If you want an excellent dark brown tan this is the product to use!</li>
      <li>I am fair complected, so I use it all over not just on my legs, and it gives me that just back from the beach look.</li>
      <li>This is great product and produces a deep rich natural tan, not orange and it tends not to streak.</li>
      <li>I am very light and tried or a natural color, not from this product.</li>
      <li>The product was what I expected and was at a good price.</li>
      <li>Golden brown.  </li>
      <li>Works the best , get dark instantly .</li>
      <li>I alternate Matahari Dark Sexy Legs with Gorgeous Gams (which I bought in store) so that my legs don&#x27;t get used to one lotion.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>Now I in no way condone bed tanning and in 23 years, this is the FIRST time I have ever done it.</li>
      <li>I switch this product up with Solid Black 100x to keep a nice full rich tan.</li>
      <li>currently (P90X, eating healthy, on a quit smoking program, new hairstyle and color, etc.)</li>
      <li>But all of TanForLess customer reviews are above 95% and when the lotion arrived, the girls at my salon verified that it was precisely what I had intended to order.</li>
      <li>In comparison with some other tanning lotions, I find it moisturizes better</li>
      <li>I knew so well in high</li>
      <li>This was a new product that was shipped and packaged well.</li>
      <li>Using this product on my legs and the Dark Sexy Tan on my upper</li>
      <li>This stuff creates an awesome tan, but it really makes you stink bad afterwards, like burned skin!  </li>
      <li>But my legs and upper chest were having a hard time catching</li>
      <li>This product shipped fast and was received in a short time.</li>
      <li>:) Take a shower a few hours later and you won&#x27;t smell anymore.</li>
      <li>When using this I try to evenly apply product, it comes out blotchy with very apparent lines.  </li>
      <li>The color is natural and lasting.</li>

<li> Not happy</li>
<li> so I was a little disappointed when that wasn&#x27;t the case</li>
<li> My legs are very tough to tan and this lotion did the job!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this with the tanning beds before my wedding. I have pale, Swedish skin and I can tan OK from the hips up - but it&#x27;s more like a \\&quot;rosey\\&quot; tan.  Using this product on my legs and the Dark Sexy Tan on my upper I got a beautiful natural-looking tan.  I got a lot of compliments.  This product helped my legs tan and added a little color while polishing them too!  I really loved this product - it worked really well for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried it and like the even color it creates.I think the smell is nice too and was recommended to try from a friend,so all in all a winner.</li>
    <li> If you have hard to tan legs,which i do  this product gets you legs tan without streaking in a short amount of time.Best product for legs out there</li>
    <li> Great price for this product cost a lot more in the salons. I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time. Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> Works the best , get dark instantly . Says use only on your legs, I use over my entire body! I used to work at a tanning salon and this is the only product line I will se</li>
    <li> Product is amazing. Used it both at the pool and in the tanning bed. My leens already have a rough time tanning but not anymore!</li>
    <li> When using this I try to evenly apply product, it comes out blotchy with very apparent lines.  Not happy and it leaves a yellow tint.  I am very light and tried or a natural color, not from this product.</li>
    <li> This product shipped fast and was received in a short time. The product was what I expected and was at a good price. I will order from this company again and I recommend it to everyone. This was a new product that was shipped and packaged well. I was able to track my package on line too.</li>
    <li> This is a very good lotion for legs. My legs are very tough to tan and this lotion did the job! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that The lotion can leave streaks on your ankles or knees if you don&#x27;t apply it evenly and sparingly.</li>
    <li> This product never disappoints.  Great color.  Golden brown.  Be sure to moisturize before application so it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
    <li> Have a tough time tanning your legs? This stuff is really wonderful! I had an upcoming vacation in the British Virgin Islands, and needed to get a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; tan ahead of the trip. I used this product, in my favorite tanning bed, and my legs looked authentically tanned (no &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; appearance) ! Really helped having the base tan, with the help of Matahari!</li>
    <li> This stuff creates an awesome tan, but it really makes you stink bad afterwards, like burned skin!  Would not purchase again, I actually gave away 1/2 the bottle because of the smell!</li>
    <li> Even the hardest legs will be brown :) I was looking for tanbing lotion for my legs as they are impossible to make brown. Then I found this lotion :) Love it!!!</li>
    <li> 1) I use this as an all-over tanning lotion, and don&#x27;t use it exclusively for my legs.  2) It does have a staining effect, so you must rub it in thoroughly to avoid streaking.  Always wipe between the fingers before tanning or you will have dark orange webbed-looking fingers.  3) Someone mentioned you smell burnt afterwards. Yeah.  But after you tan, you are burning your skin. Regardless of the lotion, usually. :) Take a shower a few hours later and you won&#x27;t smell anymore. Or put some deodorant on immediately afterwards.  4) In comparison with some other tanning lotions, I find it moisturizes better so I don&#x27;t \\&quot;flake\\&quot; the next day from dry skin.  Overall, this is great for quick results!! One of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I FREAKIN LOVE THIS LOTION!! Now I in no way condone bed tanning and in 23 years, this is the FIRST time I have ever done it. I&#x27;m going through a self makeover currently (P90X, eating healthy, on a quit smoking program, new hairstyle and color, etc.) so I thought that for once, I&#x27;d like to have some skin color since I&#x27;ve always been kind of pasty despite my Hispanic heritage. So I started tanning and I came up with a very common problem. My torso and arms looked great. But my legs and upper chest were having a hard time catching up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research online and checked out a bunch of leg tanning lotions. I was a little wary about ordering a lotion online because frankly, you never know exactly what you&#x27;re getting. But all of TanForLess customer reviews are above 95% and when the lotion arrived, the girls at my salon verified that it was precisely what I had intended to order. I did think that I was ordering the lilac fragrance so I was a little disappointed when that wasn&#x27;t the case but I then realized I hadn&#x27;t read carefully enough. The fragrance I got smells just like the coconut scented Banana Boat dark tanning oil I knew so well in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs look great now!! They shine is all lights and are finally even with the rest of my body. I alternate Matahari Dark Sexy Legs with Gorgeous Gams (which I bought in store) so that my legs don&#x27;t get used to one lotion. I highly recommend this product!! But please be sure to wash your hands after applying (or if in a salon, request baby wipes) because you&#x27;ll get orange marks in the webs between your fingers if you don&#x27;t! Good luck!!</li>
    <li> This is great product and produces a deep rich natural tan, not orange and it tends not to streak. I am fair complected, so I use it all over not just on my legs, and it gives me that just back from the beach look. It has a nice smell and I don&#x27;t smell so cooked after using the tanning bed. I switch this product up with Solid Black 100x to keep a nice full rich tan.</li>
    <li> I bought this because someone recommended a product to darken just my legs, though they didn&#x27;t say a specific one.  After looking at plenty of reviews, this one seemed the best.  I even saw some people who used it as a regular all-over tanner.  I have to say that I love it!  I am a full-blown ginger and this helped me be darker than I thought possible!  When my other tanning lotions were hardly working, I bought this with less than 2 weeks left before I left on my Bahama vacation.  In that short amount of time it made a world of difference that everyone noticed!</li>
    <li> I love Matahari it works and I always get an awesome tan with it</li>
    <li> Goes on great and even. The color is natural and lasting. My husband loves the way my legs look.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> If you want an excellent dark brown tan this is the product to use! I have used for years never disappointed Love it!</li>
