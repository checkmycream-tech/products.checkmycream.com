      <li>Uh, well, it did absolutely NOTHING for my acne  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see any results really myself.</li>
      <li>My skin is smoother and doesn&#x27;t break out as much.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Anew always was a great name brand. This product does make my skin appear brighter.</li>
    <li> I like this and have ordered it twice.  I feel that it makes my skin a little brighter and I feel a slight tingle after I use it.  However, I don&#x27;t believe it fades brown spots.  I have  a few very light brown spots on my cheeks and they have definitely not faded or vanished as I thought they would.  It does appear to shrink pores and give an overall healthier look to my skin so I&#x27;ll keep using it.  I also get a couple of uses from each pad.</li>
    <li> I love this for acne. I bought it thinking it would help with anti-aging, as well...but, alas, I haven&#x27;t seen help in that regard. However, I do love it for acne. I&#x27;m 49 years old and have begun to break out after eating certain foods. I had a big problem that came up earlier this year - a big boil that kept resurfacing. What? I&#x27;ve never had acne before so by the 3rd month I was ready to call a dermatologist. I saw this product online and read the reviews - what a lifesaver. I used this on the area every night and within two days I could see improvement. Within a week it was completely gone. Since I still break out with certain foods, I&#x27;ve decided to continue buying this and using it a couple of times a week just to stay ahead of any issues. It really works. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It came on time and in perfect condition. I really like the product so far. I am horrible about remembering to do it at night. But I can really tell a difference in my face when I use it. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These make my skin really smooth, they do work and my face feels so clean also.  Very easy to use</li>
    <li> No bad but slow working this is okay,I would buy it again and I do like it a lot</li>
    <li> It broke my neck out &amp; I had to throw it away. Burned my neck. It was terrible</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old, with dry patches, sun damage and some adult acne and I used to this product for two days, before I went to bed. I woke up today and my skin looks amazing, soft... and the pimple I had are gone, and the sun spots diminished. I usually don&#x27;t buy avon products, but I heard from a friend that this product was good, so I tried it and it was well worth the 15 dollars I spent. It did tingle a bit for around 10 minutes but it wasn&#x27;t painful. I have sensitive skin so I was worried about that, and the main reason I haven&#x27;t gotten a professional face peel yet.  I will buy this product again and again, and can&#x27;t wait to see what my face looks like in a month. I&#x27;ll update for sure.</li>
    <li> I have a stockpile of skin products for mature skin.  None live up there claims, but this one is a keeper.  Overall skin tone improved.  The few dark sun spots that have driven me crazy for years are slowly fading.  I&#x27;ve been using almost a month.  Af first, used it everyday, instead of the recommended every other. I use it on face first, then to get the most out of it continue on throat, neck, chest, back of hands, etc. Love it, will buy it again..and next time I&#x27;ll order a few extras for my BFF&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 4 weeks, using approximately 3 times a week. I have seen a little improvement of my dark spots, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it has improved my skin&#x27;s appearance drastically.</li>
    <li> Together with Avon Anew Resuracing Fluid it made a facial scar I had almost disappear!</li>
    <li> I bought this a month or 2 ago when it was on sale and have been using it as directed since. The main reason for buying this was people were saying it helped with acne so of course I jumped on it. Uh, well, it did absolutely NOTHING for my acne  so if you&#x27;re thinking of buying it for that reason DONT and also NOTHING for the fine lines. It did however help a little bit with old acne scars(which werent that bad anyways) and made my skin super smooth but the day you skipped my skin was back to normal(aka not as smooth). Maybe if I continued using it I would see more improvement and I&#x27;m sure it would be worth it in the end but I don&#x27;t have the money right now.</li>
    <li> I love, love these re-texturizing pads. Almost instantaneously, you can see a difference in your skin. My skin looked brighter and had a glow about it. It&#x27;s been helping with occasional breakouts and is great at shrinking pores. I have moderate discoloration on my face and feel that this product is really helping to even out my tone. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants better skin without spending a fortune, wants it quickly and wants it conveniently.</li>
    <li> Been looking for glycolic pads and these are great!  Great price, too!</li>
    <li> This is truly one of Avon&#x27;s best products. Helps to brighten the skin. I am 62 and I can tell a difference when  I miss a week from my routine.</li>
    <li> I use it on alternate days. It works for me, evens the skin tone, pores are smaller, overall happy with the results. It made my skin super dry when used separately. Dryness vanished after i followed it with a nighttime moisture.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great for acne</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have only used for a few weeks but I do notice a little improvement!</li>
    <li> I was surprised the next morning, I was like wow my face is so refresh and glowing.  I didnt know pretreatment how dull my face was until I tried this peel that took the dead skin layer away. I have very sensitive skin and had no irritation with this Avon Peel.</li>
    <li> Good product. Was tired of paying big bucks for other higher priced peel pads. These work just as well as those. Everything arrives on time in good condition. Don&#x27;t waste your money on higher priced pads as Avon is just as good!</li>
    <li> Effective for the price. It helped me stop a break out cycle on my chin when I was too impatient to make and wait for bigger changes to take effect. Follow other users tip and cut in half. Use only 1/2 the pad per use which has plenty of product on it for the entire face.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and i have not seen any drastic changes in my skin. I am a african American female and I&#x27;ve never really have had an acne problem. But I have a lot of dark spots which makes my skin tone uneven. I must say it cleared like 30% of the dark marks but its nothing that other people would notice if they look at me. Good product but not for me.</li>
    <li> The pads are a little drier than I had expected, but they do work well.  It has helped my complexion. I use them every other day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product a little over two weeks and I can see a change already. Each time I get acne bumps they turn black regardless of what I do. After using it for a few days I could see a difference. The chemical stings a bit but not so bad that it&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t endure. I was willing to endure anything to get these spots to go away. Make sure you moisturize afterwards because it does leave your face dry.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have dark spots on my face, but sun damage on my chest area. This product really did lighten the dark areas. Plus, it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
    <li> I love the glow and reduced spots after using these pads!  I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much! It keeps my skin smooth and blemish-free. I definitely notice a (negative) difference if I stop using it for a while. I read about it a lot online, many women are big fans, so if you think it may be up your alley, check it out. Great price, not painful, easy to use, no weird smell... good stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product. My face starts to feel clean n brighter from first use. Stings a little, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I Have been using as directed and have seen no change ....a waste of money........</li>
    <li> They can sting a bit and you feel a little coating on your face, but it does not bother me and I feel the result of smoother skin is well worth it. I will order again and again, as I have in the past. They arrieved well packaged and sealed.</li>
    <li> I have been using anew clinical for sometime, and will for a long time to come.  I get great complements on my skin so others also notice it!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t rave about it, but this is my second jar.  It could be working minimally since my skin feels smoother.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used it twice a week. It really helps to keep my skin clear</li>
    <li> These really work!  I use them twice a week after a good cleansing with a gentle scrub.  Then I wait 5-10 minutes before I splash water on my face, pat dry, then mist with rose or neroli water and follow with a mask.  I am so gorgeous HAHAHAHA.  But seriously, people ask all the time why my face looks so healthy.  Following this regimen, along with daily cleansing and moisturizing, and 8 glasses of water per day, has taken years off my face.</li>
    <li> Great product that works! I got my husband to use this too after seeing the results on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!!! The price was excellent! Will buy again! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Has a nice tingle to it. It makes my pores drain-which is what I wanted. It keeps my pores clean and small.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced I saw a difference the very first time I used these pads. I&#x27;ve now used them every other day for about two weeks and feel my skin looks younger overall. My pores appear smaller and little age spots that were beginning to form have faded. I was, however, frustrated that when this arrived the first time, it wasn&#x27;t sealed inside. The vendor was very nice and sent a replacement immediately! Unfortunately, while the box was sealed on the outside, this one also had a broken seal inside the jar. The pads seem moist enough, so I think it may just be a factory defect, but it&#x27;s a bit frustrating to have two separate jars not sealed inside. But I really do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Gave it a three &#x27;cause it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
    <li> I have always loved my AVON products and this is no exception.  The peel helps to keep my skin clear and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Fakes, unsealed and reek of alcohol. I&#x27;ve used the product before and this is not it</li>
    <li> The smell of alcohol was so strong that I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it, especially on my face.</li>
    <li> What a great deal on an awesome product. I usually buy from avon, but this was so much cheaper. This is a wonderful product to use, I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing!!</li>
    <li> I liked these a lot. I used them about twice a week at night, and when I wake up on the morning my skin always has a nice glow to it.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin and am so happy I&#x27;m not allergic to this. I use it once in a while when my face feels like it needs a little more cleaning and this product does the trick! LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> WILL make you break out.&lt;br /&gt;no results besides break outs</li>
    <li> I love this.  I don&#x27;t really have noticeable wrinkles, but some are starting to form.  I have used this every night for two months now.  I started seeing results after a week.  My skin is smoother and doesn&#x27;t break out as much.  I used to get cyclic acne during &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; but I have noticed I don&#x27;t even get that anymore.  I&#x27;m really happy with this product.  I just need to find a cream that works well with it.  I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the ANEW advanced wrinkle corrector.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its a great addition my very simple skin care regimen. I look about 12-15 yrs younger than what I actually am only because I started exfoliating my skin when I was 14 and I&#x27;m now 45. I don&#x27;t wear foundation and never have due in part to this product. I do wear a sunscreen. Not one wrinkle on my face or neck. It&#x27;s been out for years and has to be one of the best products out there...keep in mind that great skin starts from within...</li>
    <li> Do l need to wash it off after application?.directiom did not specify it.pls let me know. I will change my rating after knowing how to use it.</li>
    <li> I love these!! A friend gave me samples and I promptly bought the jar.  Tingly sensation that almost borderline burn for a few seconds but works great!!</li>
    <li> After two weeks have seen slight improvement.  Perhaps it&#x27;s not designed for 65 year old skin.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Delivery!  Great to cleanse your face and then just wipe over your face before bed; will definitely see a smoother, more radiant complexion!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes, but they make my face feel nice and clean.  I like the rough side of the pads</li>
    <li> This has glycolic acid in it which really helps skin tone. Used every other day it seems to make a difference.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for amazing product</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  My sister in law used to sell Avon, so I first learned of this product when I purchased from her years ago.  It is hard to explain exactly what they do to my skin in scientific terms, but I use them maybe two times a week and the morning after I use them, my skin is soft, clear, and has a dewy glow.  I am glad Amazon carries this product and will keep this in my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results really myself. That&#x27;s not to say it cant for someone else. I am a man using a woman&#x27;s product, perhaps its not optimized to work on men&#x27;s skin idk! Other women seemed to have success so take their word more so than mine!</li>
