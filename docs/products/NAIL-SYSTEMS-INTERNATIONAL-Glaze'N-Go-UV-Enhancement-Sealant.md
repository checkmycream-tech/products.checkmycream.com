    <li> Always love glaze n go!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent and got here in an amazing amount of time!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best UV top coat and sealant!!!!!!!! I should have bought in bulk. If you do gels or acrylics you need to have this!!!</li>
    <li> I use this whenever I do my acrylic nails, and I get a wonderful outcome every time I used it, it gives the nails a wonderful shine, and keeps that shine until you remove the nail!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this top coat! Easy to use, great shine, and great price also Tack Free!  On the bottle it says let it cure/dry for 90 seconds in the UV lamp, it still felt wet so  i cured for 3 minutes and it was fully dry with shine. But overall great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional nail technician for 25 +years. This is great gel top coat to go over pink And white permanent French artificial nails. Can not be used for manicures and pedicures over natural nails.</li>
    <li> Best topcoat ever dries super clear</li>
    <li> Product is a 5 star no doubt but I gave it 2 stars since I was supposed to get it the 18 days before Christmas and ended up receiving it the 27 but besides that I recommend this product !!!!</li>
    <li> This may sound cray cray but I LOVE the smell. It reminds me of actually being in the nail salon. I put a coat on my thumb and to glides real smooth. I ordered the UV lamp to be able to use this polish and cure it but it hasn&#x27;t arrived to me yet. I can&#x27;t wait to do my own acrylic nails and use this. Happy so far!</li>
    <li> This one is a good product, the shipping was very fast, and farter was everything oke, I recomend this product</li>
    <li> Love love love it!! It seals gels &amp; acrylics.</li>
    <li> Came really fast and work perfectly. I had never used this product before so I was a little skeptical of the &amp;#34;tack free&amp;#34; part, but it actually works! I swear it&#x27;s like magic I love them and will certainly order more!</li>
    <li> By far the best gel top coat I have used... I like it better then IBD gel top coat... Great stuff...</li>
    <li> Love how this leaves my nails! Only thing I noticed is that when I applied on top of nail polish (of course once it was completely dry!) I noticed shrinkage which is no bueno for me buuuut other then that it&#x27;s works as it should.</li>
    <li> The Best nail glaze around. And the shine last for weeks!</li>
    <li> Probably the best top coat so far. I tried the IBD and it has nothing on this one. Maybe its just preference but i am very satisfied with this</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is amazing! Shine like diamonds!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this stuff twice now and every time it cracks. has a great shine, really wished it worked.</li>
    <li> The Glaze-N-Go is OUTSTANDING. When this stuff cures on your nails, it is like glass!! BEST!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech and this is all I use. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing and a great price here on amazon it&#x27;s $16.00 at my local beauty store</li>
    <li> Gives a pretty good and lasting shine. I only wish that the product wasn&#x27;t so runny. It&#x27;s very hard to get full and even coverage without it running into the sidewalls (which will cause lifting).</li>
    <li> It leave the nail nice n shiny</li>
