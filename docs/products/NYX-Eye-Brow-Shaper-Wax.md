<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product! Keeps my brows in shape!</li>
    <li> love this when shaping my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> What a great product - no more misplaced eyebrow hairs!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Refund please!!!</li>
    <li> Good product to help keep the brows in place.</li>
    <li> I love this. With an eyebrow pencil, this really makes my eyebrows look and stay perfect throughout the day.</li>
    <li> OK,, but hard to sharpen, need to send a means of sharpening with it.</li>
    <li> I have to deal with over tweezed brows from my teenage years and have used just about everything to try and fill in the sparse areas. I just bought this in place of sigma brow wax and it&#x27;s is SO much better. Lasts all day and is not shiny like I found the sigma to be.  Really happy with this! Plus I try and buy cruelty fee it&#x27;s a win win!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used eye brow wax before but decided I need it. This one works great. Works great alone as well as with eyebrow filler. Doesn&#x27;t blend with the color or smear. Nice product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars but I have not tried it as yet....do you need cloth to pull the wax off the eye brow?</li>
    <li> great product! Will definitively buy again when I ran out.</li>
    <li> After having rotator cuff surgery, I could only sleep on my left side.  My brows were bending from sleeping on them and this wax does the trick to straightening them out and smoothing them down.  It seems to last a long time too, so I am super happy with this little wax pencil.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have much luck with this product.</li>
    <li> I GIVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE ITS OKAY, BUT IF YOU HAVE EYEBROWS BECAREFUL BECAUSE IT TAKE SOME OF YOUR HAIR OFF THE EYEBROW.  AND LADIES I KNOW HOW HARD IT FOR US TO ACHIEVE A NICE EYEBROW AND THE HAIR TAKE LONG TO GROW BACK, SO BE CAREFUL.  I ONLY USE IT AT THE BEGINNING OF MY EYEBROW AND THAT&#x27;S IT. I LOVE MY EYEBROW TO MUCH TO  EVEN CHALLENGE IT WITH THIS PRODUCT, SO WILL I RECOMMEND NO... BUT IF YOU DON&#x27;T CARE GO RIGHT AHEAD!!!</li>
    <li> Refining the brows, its great. Taming my brows is another matter, I still have a few stubborn strays that the wax just can&#x27;t control.</li>
    <li> Could not sharpen this pencil - disappointing! Otherwise liked it.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. It is well made and a good value. I find the NYX Products to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to have to get used to how it makes my brows feel (kinda sticky but not too bad). It does what it says - helps to shape brows. However, I was expecting it to have more holding power than it does.</li>
    <li> This is such a neat tool. Defines your brows instantly, making them look polished and groomed. Works for any brow-thick, thin, or in-between. Your brows stay in place all day. I apply my brow makeup then use this over to seal it in. Does not take hair off at all.</li>
    <li> I did not need to re-apply this product in a colder weather, because my forehead did not sweat..however, when I did go into a heated environment I did need to re-apply to keep my brows in place. Overall though, I love this product and it really does work!</li>
    <li> This is great for getting those flawless eyebrows that everyone is doing. I use it to shape the brown before i pencil it in. It help keep the hairs together so filling them becomes a piece of cake.</li>
    <li> it works great and i use it everyday</li>
    <li> So happy I decided to purchase it.  I am 31 and have very little brow hair from years of waxing them. After reading other reviews I decided to try this product and I am so happy I did.  It keeps your brows in place and makes them seem thicker.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It works great! My only complaints would be that it&#x27;s a chubby pencil so I needed to get a special sharpener for it and that I feel like I sharpen it really often, but maybe that&#x27;s because I use it all the time, heh.</li>
    <li> This definitely helps when shaping and filling in eyebrows.</li>
    <li> A great (and less expensive) version of the Anastacia brow wax.</li>
    <li> This is much cheaper than the cheapest brow wax pencil at Sephora. It works well to keep brow powder on all day.</li>
    <li> I use this to hold my brows in place for shaping them and to just keep them in place during the day. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because she needed a wax and it was cheaper on amazon. There hasn&#x27;t been a day where she hasn&#x27;t used it since. If you need eye brow wax this is the one to go for!</li>
    <li> is too creamy, a litle dificult to aply&lt;br /&gt;my advice is aply this with a brush&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s ok for the pice</li>
    <li> This is perfect for shaping the brows and make everything smoothed. I use a tiny bit of eyebrow pencil then I run this over the brow. Happy with the results I acheived</li>
    <li> makes it difficult to apply eye brow liner.</li>
    <li> Lovee it! It feels a bit heavy but other than that, it does its job!!</li>
    <li> Literally a perfect base coat, left my eyebrows on fleek</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I love that this wax leaves no film behind and adds a little extra protection to my brows. Perfect size and finish.</li>
    <li> Wax is the best solution to keep my eyebrows in place, and NYX is as good as Givenchy or Anastasia for a fraction of their price.</li>
    <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
    <li> Keeps the eyebrows in shape!</li>
    <li> AMAZING! works great for my curly-ish eyebrows!</li>
    <li> This comes in handy when drawing on your brows.  It helps give shape, and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.  I need plenty of help since my brows are light.</li>
    <li> This product was really great. It helps tame my bushy eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;I just love it!</li>
    <li> This eyebrow shaper wax is easy to use and works perfectly. You&#x27;ll need a large pencil sharpener to sharpen it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my brows tame! Doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller, and superb shipping (came in much earlier than expected; which is always nice). Only thing I would recommend is using a more mascara-like brush to sort your brows before applying the wax; if you have thick eyebrows such as I do. Recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> Helps in taming unruly eyebrows.  Need more time to practice with this.</li>
    <li> Works great but does make my skin oily around my eyebrows</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff. Keeps my unruly brows in place.</li>
    <li> I am blessed with thick brows that can sometimes be unruly. The biggest issue I have is with the hairs at the arch curling in/down  instead of out. If they went out, they would help define the arch. But when they curl in, they just look sloppy. When I saw this product, I was so excited that I wouldn&#x27;t need to keep brushing the hairs into place all day. The concept is great! First, the pencil form makes it easy to apply the wax exactly where you need it. Second, the wax is clear and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue or strange flakes. HOWEVER, this wax does not keep those hairs from curling in at all. I&#x27;ve tried it several times and still find when I look in the mirror that my arches need to be fixed up. I can see how it would be helpful for people who need to draw on their brows, but this pencil did not work for my problem.</li>
    <li> This is the item I have been purchasing from Nordstrom for $22. I was so happy to see it at a much more affordable price!</li>
    <li> I am so surprised by the negative comments.  I absolutely love this product.  I am a makeup junkie and I have both high and low end products more high than low.  It kept my brows in place and I have some bald and thinning brows and it helped make them appear full again.  I believe it is all in the technique you use to get your brows looking amazing. I use Anastasia products but I always try and look for a dupe in certain things. This product really worked well for me and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t flake or leave an obvious waxy residue on your brows.  I use it to keep brow hair sitting in one direction. Think of it like you would gel for your hair.  I then follow up with a brow brush with some color to fill it some areas I over plucked.  Easy to use as the pencil is thicker than a eye pencil.</li>
    <li> I love this eye brow wax!  It tames my brows without all the fussiness of having to think of a colored pencil and all that entails.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have pretty full, naturally arched eyebrows but this makes them look absolutely perfect. The wax doesn&#x27;t have a greasy, sticky feeling like other brow waxes I have used do and it&#x27;s easy to manuever because it&#x27;s in pencil form.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t tried this before ! This works fantastic on my brows to keep those little stray hairs in place. Every girl should have one of theses in theri make up bag. Highly recommend ! You can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> While I do like this wax, I was hoping that it would more closely resemble the wax that comes in the eyebrow cake palette. This wax seems to be a bit drier than the one I was trying to replace, but still works well. Only complaint is that I had to purchase a special extra jumbo sharpener just for this pencil, as my regular jumbo sharpener is still too small.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell that it does anything. Disappointed</li>
    <li> Product is melted and in bad condition</li>
    <li> Is too heavy on my brows and I feel like they are weighted/matted down.  I can feel it on my brows all day.</li>
    <li> I just started getting my brows done about 6 months ago and I wanted something to keep them in place.  This product does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice look without looking caked on.  Good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works great can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping brows shaped.I have to use a pencil as my brows are light so it keeps the color.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of brow wax until I came across this gem while searching eyebrow pencils.  I am pleasantly surprised by how well this works!  Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Causes redness at brow line, Not pleased.</li>
    <li> This is great eye brow wax. I use it when my eyebrows decide they want to be difficult and unruly. One my biggest pet peeves is messy eyebrow and this product is a cure to that problem. The only con is that you must be careful with how much wax you use because if you use to much your eyebrows lose their natural look.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, does what it says. Only thing is, it can cause a buildup of white wax on your brows that looks unsightly if you don&#x27;t watch out and use too much.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with clear gel mascara so. This conditions brows and settles down stragglers. It could be used at night or to shape by day.</li>
    <li> This stick works great to discretely keep my brows tidy and in place.  I also use it to help give better definition to the arches.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Out of all the different brand brow gels and waxes. This is by far...way far...the best and the most easy to use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as advertised. I have very unruly eyebrows, however, so it may just be me.</li>
    <li> Door&#x27;s not hold my brows in place.  Ineffective for me.</li>
    <li> Does work as it advertise&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the different brand brow gels and waxes. This is by far...way far...the best and the most easy to use. It came on time and with a nice package.</li>
    <li> This is a great little wax pencil - I rub a dab on my finger and apply it to my brow that way.  Will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> I have tried other waxes but always go back to this one. It is super easy to apply, stays put and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like some others I have tried.  For the price, you can&#x27;t get a better brow wax than this. Love it.</li>
    <li> Eye brow shaper wax, where have you been all my life.... Love it! It does the job, helps my brows look as if I just walked out of the salon :)</li>
    <li> I have thicker brows and this pen is great for keeping them shaped and in place! I draw in directly onto my brows and use the pressure of the pen to shape, only sometimes I&#x27;ll have to go in there with some fingers and put some stragglers back into place. I love using this so much more than those brow gels that take forever to dry, and then are crusty feeling - this pen provides both shape and flexibility.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to fill in my eyebrows because they are already fine the way they are, But I like to keep the salon look how it is all together and smooth. This Works!</li>
    <li> works well to keep the eyebrows shaped</li>
    <li> Perfect wax does not give a fake look. Perfect for in between tweezing/waxing. I would definetly recommend this product if your looking to give your eyebrows that perfect shape.</li>
    <li> i got this recently when ulta was having their Nyx 40% off sale... It&#x27;s amazing... I have dark eyebrows with pretty long hairs, I trim them a bit but not too much because they will look too sparse for my taste. this stuff is just what I need, keeps everything In place without looking like i used a bunch of gel... As others have mentioned, if you are going to use additional brow makeup its best to save this for after, not before.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the trick with those unruly brow hairs</li>
    <li> Not good quality, flakes off</li>
    <li> Its a stick of wax. It lays down your eyebrow hair with no problem.</li>
    <li> Need a special sharpener and when you sharpen you lose some of the wax.  They should make this like they do with the chap stick which by the way does the same job.</li>
    <li> I DONT PARTICULARLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT, ITS KIND OF LIKE A WAX AND WHEN I USE IT WITH MY EYEBROW PRODUCT SOMETIMES IT RUBS OF THE PRODUCT OR CAUSES UNEVEN APPLICATION..</li>
    <li> I only apply my eye makeup once a day, unlike some other ladies who refresh several times. I use this to keep my eyebrows in line as they can get pretty wild.</li>
    <li> Makes my eyebrows look a bit fuller, may be because i have long eyebrow hairs when i go without threading and the wax spreads them out. Doesn&#x27;t keep them in place for long though.</li>
    <li> Very helpful in maintaining my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> This helps the brow stay in place. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, this is the item for you. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time today and not sure if I used it to it&#x27;s full potential.  It did however keep my brows a little neater where they tend to be unruly near my nose.  Going to experiment with some other eyebrow powders, pencils and see how good this really is.  I would definitely recommend especially if you do not use any pencil.</li>
    <li> Not exactly a miracle worker but it does a pretty good job for holding your eyebrow at a certain place for a little bit. I noticed you can&#x27;t use too much or else it backfires and makes you end up looking worse than you did before you used it because your hair will stick together pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
    <li> Its ok I THINK MY EYEBROWS ARE TO THICK SO IT WAS OK</li>
    <li> i used it once . i liked it</li>
    <li> Doesnt last. Can&#x27;t be sharpened .It uses up quickly.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product! I love it and recommend it to anyone having trouble to tame those &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; eyebrows...</li>
    <li> This is the best ive even had! And I was a first time user! I got so many complements on my eyebrows,it made me feel good about myself true story lol of course I used this before I put any makeup on and it stayed in place the whole day!!! Ladies if u love wearing makeup let me say this is the best ,and its definitely worth the money! I promise u won&#x27;t regret!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, keeps stray eyebrows in place.</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes your brows look perfect, and they stay that way way, like you just got them done!</li>
    <li> i use this everyday to tame my eyebrows. works like a charm.</li>
    <li> For years I used clear mascara to shape my brows but this product is so much better and not messy.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I ever used wax on my eyebrows. It really does hold everything in place and the color.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what to do with this product. I thought it was an eyebrow shaper to shape the eyebrow and remove unnecessary hairs but it is not and I&#x27;m not able to get a refund</li>
    <li> I like the way it goes on, but by the middle of the day it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working anymore. Like it may have absorbed into my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this for the price. It last a long time and keeps my crazy brows in shape. Very good value and am ordering it again.</li>
    <li> lOVE THIS IT REALLY DOES SHAPE YOUR EYE BROW. LOVE THIS PRODUCT CAN NOT LEAVE MY HOUSE WITH OUT IT.</li>
    <li> I have the urban decay brow box but ran out of wax. Use this as a replacement and like it better than the wax in the box!!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Mrs. John,&amp;#34; here. I maintain that eyebrow makeup is critical to giving one&#x27;s face balance and always have used a taupe color to do that (even though my brows are dark; a light hand will fill them in and shape/extend them.) If you have any unruly bits in your eyebrow(s), a brow shaper wax can fix that. I was worried about adding something oily to my face, esp. this close above my eye, but this is not an oily product at all. Priced right and works well.</li>
    <li> I was using the Mac eyebrow wax, but this one works just as well.  You just need a jumbo sharpener.  Will buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> The pencil makes it easy to apply the wax, and it&#x27;s soft enough to go on smoothly, but still has enough hold to keep my eyebrows where I want them.  I rarely wear make up and have limited skill at applying it, so hooray for a product I can&#x27;t mess up!  This works well for achieving a well-groomed but still natural look.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and works great with the NYX eyebrow powder. It definitely has a different texture and feels less greasy than the one that comes in the NYX Cake powder set so I use this instead.</li>
    <li> Cheap yet effective! Perfect for keeping brows in place if you don&#x27;t want to add any color. I won&#x27;t buy expensive brow wax again!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, helps keep eyebrows and brow color fixed and set all day!</li>
    <li> Helps with runaway eyebrows quite well!</li>
    <li> I like this brow shaper wax but I seem to go through it really quickly!  Maybe I just need more than some people to get my brows how I want them but I haven&#x27;t had this long and it seems to be shrinking so rapidly.  Will probably try another product next time just to see if I can get something that will last me longer but overall, this works well.  Totally clear and lasts a while.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are in control and I LOVE this brow wax!</li>
    <li> Need to use a brow brush with it; works great</li>
    <li> The shaper works pretty well. Have not compared it to many other products but  the shaper seems to  work well.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Keeps my eyebrows down. I have been looking for this product and finally have found it. Will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I liked that there wasn&#x27;t a waxy feel to the brows when using this product and it didn&#x27;t affect putting on eyeshadow. It worked all day!</li>
    <li> Very light, easy to apply. Keeps shape all day.</li>
    <li> eh not worth the bother to have...</li>
    <li> I absolutely enjoy using this product. As many other great reviews indicate, it does not feel heavy and is not visible on the brows. It keeps the shape all day and does not require additional applications. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite thing to share with people right now. Works great</li>
    <li> I have naturally very thick eyebrows and it is hard to tame them. This product does place it where I want my eyebrow hairs to be, but it will not stay like that throughout the day. Even when I change my shirt, if my eyebrows are touched then they become out of place. I like it because if I am careful they will stay in place for the most part, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to be careful in the first place.</li>
    <li> Tamed my unruly reshaped eyebrows. Easy to use and stays a long time. Thanks NYX for a great product, and nice price!</li>
    <li> So hard to find a sharpener that fit for this. :( But, it&#x27;s a great product as most NYX products are.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for making unruly brows stay put! That is the purpose of this pencil. It&#x27;s not for enhancing the brow line.</li>
    <li> I am 45 and my eyebrows were so unruly until I bought this product! I love this product.</li>
    <li> If you have thick or long eyebrows, this will keep them in place.  It is not the best if you are filling in your eyebrows with something but it does hold them weel.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brow shaper might need one more i use it every day works great thanks nyx cosmetics luv it five stars</li>
    <li> If I had not already been using another product, this one might have satisfied me, but it isn&#x27;t as good as the one I have been using.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;&#x27;s a useful little pencil to tame my unruly eyebrows. However, it does have a tendency of leaving like a white greasy residue. Since my eyebrows are very dark - it can almost look like I have eyebrow dandruff - but applying less of it solves this problem.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are extremely unruly.  Because I damaged them during my youth, my eyebrows do not lie flat.  This wax not only shapes my eyebrows - it also tames them.  The wax has a smooth application and my eyebrows look perfect and polished afterwards.  And unlike the gels that I used in the past, the wax lasts throughout the day.  I also purchased the [[ASIN:B003HG4GQI NYX Sharpener]] and it sharpens with very little waste.  This is a great product and I&#x27;m not sure how I managed without it for so long.</li>
    <li> My brows can be very unruly and I was excited to find this.  I love NYX to begin with and I think this product is a great concept.  I did find that my brows did move out of place throughout the day so it was not a total fix but it definetly helped a lot.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE MY EYEBROW WAX PENCIL IT IS  THE BEST AND AT THIS PRICE I CAN BUY ONE FOR HOME AND FOR MY PURSE AND FOR A FRIEND LOVE IT  THANKS  NICE PRICE TOO I CAN NOW STOCK UP  ALSO IT LAST A LONG TIME AND KEEPS MY BROWS IN PLACE AND DOESNT MELT AWAY LIKE OTHER PRODUCTS DON&#x27;T LET THE SIZE FOOL YOU IT LAST AND I USE IT EVERYDAY .</li>
    <li> Love it going to buy more!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it make you eyebrows stick and is better for full your eyebrows and is not greasy</li>
    <li> Happy, it does exactly what I need and tames those brows!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find a sharpener that it fits into to be able to use it.</li>
    <li> I have very stubborn eyebrows so this brow wax did not help.  A few of my hairs fell of as well. I looked down at the pencil and a few of my eyebrow hairs were stuck on it.</li>
    <li> It works ok but not great; sometimes it leaves flakes on my eyebrows and other days it simply doesn&#x27;t hold them. But about half of the time I can get a good look out of it, and I do like that it comes in a pencil, so all-in-all, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> The product works well enough for four stars.  I think I need a little more time to work with it, but I like it.</li>
    <li> As a first time user of Eye Brow wax I must say I am very pleased with the results.  I feel more secure that my eyebrows will stay dark and luscious through out the day.  NYX has so many great products and now eye brow wax is part of my normal makeup regiment.</li>
    <li> I was hoping the wax would be stronger</li>
    <li> noticed a slight difference, not as marketed</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> Brows after 15 minutes look unruly. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I have noticed that most of NYX products are not the best quality.</li>
    <li> Horrible item! Literally almost gave my boyfriend a heart attack after seeing his readings. And yes, that&#x27;s plural. An example would be a reading of 258/156! I&#x27;m pretty sure my boyfriend would be close to death if he repeatedly had blood pressure that high. I&#x27;m pissed I didn&#x27;t return it on time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if your eyebrows don&#x27;t stay in place or you have some strays. It makes them look well groomed. I also use it&lt;br /&gt;on my hubby&#x27;s unruly brows. It looks like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an eyebrow was.  It works as expected, is clear, and with an eyebrow pencil, helps brows to stay in place.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep about half the eyebrows in shape.  For some reason the tail end of my brows  stick straight out in places and this wax is not able to keep them flat.</li>
    <li> Trust me, this is worth the buy. If you want to do anything with your eyebrows, shaping them, etc., definitely buy this. It&#x27;s really really great.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped it would. I still prefer clear mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought this item based on the great reviews but it does not work for me.  Why you ask?  First of all, it takes 2-3 eyebrows hairs off every time I use so I might not have any left if I was to finish with the pencil.  Second, it leaves the eyebrows with a greased up look.  Third, it doesn&#x27;t fully get my brows in place so some of them are sticking up and out and I would have to use a brush to comb it down.  My previous eyebrow shaper came with a built in brush and I am going to stick to that.</li>
    <li> Love this eyebrow shaper! Goes on smoothly, and keeps any unruly hairs tamed all day long. Definitely a staple item to have!</li>
    <li> minimal amount required. long lasting :)</li>
    <li> I have very contrary brows &amp; this shaper helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a gel wand, but this is far simpler and goes on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Worked great for me.</li>
    <li> Love this! Keeps my eyebrows in place all day!</li>
    <li> Works well to keep unruly brows in place. I apply before my pencil and it helps with setting it too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, whether you use a color filler or go without.</li>
    <li> This product is pricey, and you need to buy a larger sharpener to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a one step product. Once you apply this, you have to use another brush or spoolie to shape the brows. It also leaves my brows feeling sticky. Sometimes little pieces of lint can stick to my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would much rather stick to the ELF clear brow gel.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a waxy texture but more like an oily one. I&#x27;m not liking it so much so I guess I&#x27;ll keep searching for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; one.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! So glad that I purchased this! Makes my eyebrows look much better!</li>
    <li> I really love my eye brow shaper wax. I&#x27;m constantly making sure my brows are perfectly arch and beautiful. It glides on smooth and gently carefree. No build up of residue. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I thought it was this is just a pencil with soft wax in it. I thought it was a pencil you heat up and draw over the eyebrows and it pulls them no. This is just to make your eyebrows stick down... and it works, but it leaves your eyebrows all oily feeling...</li>
    <li> How have I never used eyebrow wax before? I have naturally thick eyebrows so this is amazing for in between waxes when they become unruly. I also love that it holds them AND the color in place (I use powder) great find!</li>
    <li> This is my first time to use a product of this type.  So far, it has done well and blends easily while still shaping brows leaving a completely natural look.  I hope it works as well in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to purchase the NYX dual pencil sharpener for $4.00.  My existing jumbo sharpener was too small to work.</li>
    <li> Why do such great cosmetic companies that have super products find the smallest ways of giving you tiny amounts!  Come on guys! Not all of us can afford high end makeup anyway and when we try to get the best, it&#x27;s all in the smallest containers or sizes!  Give us more please!? Only reason why I don&#x27;t rate products like this with 5 starts!</li>
    <li> I like this wax. I bought it without knowing what it&#x27;s doe. But now that I know what it&#x27;s for, I actually like it</li>
    <li> So happy to find this.  I wonder why you don&#x27;t find this pencil everywhere.  This works great to tame those individual eyebrow hairs that just have to go against the grain.  Just a light coating is delivered with a swipe of the pencil.  Not heavy feeling or greasy.  Completely invisible except for a nice smoothness to your brows.</li>
    <li> I tried this countless ways-&lt;br /&gt;light, heavy, smoothed over with my fingers or with an old mascara brush, but no matter how I did it, it looked like i had super gross eyebrow dandruff. It was immediate or delayed depending on the application method, but inevitable. I&#x27;m not sure how people are using this and not having the same problem, but honestly, you&#x27;d be better off using vaseline or rosebud salve.</li>
    <li> I was so bushy brows. Now I can smooth them out and apply my brow filler, and they look much nicer.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Wish I had found it long ago! Easy to apply and speaking from someone with crazy eyebrows, it worked wonders! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time taming their eyebrows!</li>
    <li> posting from my boyfriends account. this brow wax is really one of the best I&#x27;ve used! I prefer it to the waxes that come in the urban decay and too faced brow boxes. it&#x27;s easy to apply and really holds the hairs in place.</li>
    <li> this wax pencil is so on point. the consistency is just right and its quicker and easier to use than those wax pots most other brands offer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to use it in a special occasion cuz it make my eyebrows falls when I use it but in the same time it&#x27;s gave a good and long lasting color and shape.</li>
    <li> It does what its suppose to do. The only thing is the pencil goes does fast.</li>
    <li> Keeps the brows groomed and in place for the most part, makes them look sharp which I love. I will repurchase :)</li>
    <li> Better and cheaper than that Anastasia stuff. A staple in my makeup bag. A little goes a long way. Use this first before power. Not so good for those that go pencil heavy though.</li>
    <li> Yay!!! This wax works perfectly. My unruly brow hairs stay put and no clumping mess. Yay!!!!! It is easy to wash off. I would suggest using the wax after brow pencil. You can move the hair exactly where you want it and it stays in place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using this kind of product so all I can say is it does it&#x27;s job :)&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my brows in place for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Very nice ,prepare your eye brows then add color perfect !</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t an extraordinary thing. It&#x27;s a stick of wax. It goes on matte, not shiny, and is, for all intents and purposes, invisible... so apply as much or as little as you need. I use this for taming my brows and keeping them neat looking. I don&#x27;t use a brow powder with this. I definitely prefer this stick as opposed to the poured pots that you apply with a brush, which I think are better if you are applying brow color. I think the stick really helps mold things down and keep them looking tidy. It&#x27;s especially good for in-between tweezing/trimming, when your brows are looking a little unruly. It molds them into shape with ease. It is a little hard to stick down unruly hairs that are really long or have a curl to them, so when I encounter those I usually just pluck them out. Would repurchase. I have occasionally seen drugstore brands of this that seem to work the same for cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a fan of Revlon&#x27;s Brow Fantasy, but the brow fantasy gel doesn&#x27;t last as long as this (8+ hours).</li>
    <li> Great tool and keeps eyebrows neat all day</li>
    <li> I use eye brow powder and this helps it to last longer.  Easy to apply and does not look greasy.  I will buy it again.  It does keep wild brow hairs under control.  Can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend turned me on to this product.  Works great for those stray hairs that you want to tame and not pluck.</li>
    <li> I just got it applied it and I can tell my eye brows are set for the day :-) happy I purchased</li>
    <li> I really like this wax crayon. It does tame flyaway eyebrow hairs and the large size saves time as you can smooth an eyebrow in one swipe. What you must know is that you have to use the NYX Sharpener or you will ruin the wax point. Another sharpener with a large hole will not work. It&#x27;s a good price even with the added sharpener.</li>
    <li> No sharpener and the product doesn&#x27;t really work as well as I had hoped. Elf gel is actually better I think.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this as I usually use hairspray and an old toothbrush to keep brows in check, however, must admit I&#x27;m certainly surprised and happy with this product as one can&#x27;t always carry hairspray nor toothbrush. This does work and it works good. At first I was hesitant to order this product because some reviews stated it was waxy, it&#x27;s not, the trick I&#x27;ve discovered after playing around with it for a couple of days it not to use too much. Also, no concerns regarding brow sharpening pencil as Revlon sells wide stick sharpeners, why even here on Amazon or your local Walgreens. On Amazon, enter: Revlon Universal Points Sharpener and you&#x27;ll save yourself some time and effort. I&#x27;m Happy :)</li>
    <li> this works really well to keep eyebrows in place but it is a hassle to sharpen as the wax gets caught in the sharpener you buy separately. also dont use too much or it will look like clown eyebrows lol. i use it often though to look polished through my day.</li>
    <li> This is a good wax for everyday wear. It&#x27;s kind of short so I don&#x27;t see it lasting very long. If I&#x27;m going for a fresh face I&#x27;ll just use this sans cake powder to keep my stray curly hairs in place. I mainly use it as a base before I apply the nyx cake powder and wax because it&#x27;s a little more firm than the wax provided in the kit. I&#x27;ve found that it prevents the sometimes glistening effect the softer wax can have when it&#x27;s really hot and humid and my face starts to get dewy/sweaty.</li>
    <li> Once in a while, my brow hairs are just not cooperative.  This wax pencil tames them down so no complaints from me!  I don&#x27;t use it that often, so this pencil will last me for years to come!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think this would work, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it!  Works like magic !  Can&#x27;t be without it and I will definitely buy more.  Good for people with a lot of their own brows!</li>
    <li> Not too bad, it does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> I only gave this three stars because I haven&#x27;t figured it out just yet but I know that I will like it</li>
    <li> I love this wax pencil! Im growing my eyebrows back, its taking forever but Im determined to leave them alone so I need some real help with shaping. Plus I dont have the greatest arch to begin with. This pencil allows me to shape them, even I dare say lift my brows. It is amazing and will always be in my beauty bag from now on</li>
    <li> because this product is awesome love the eye brow wax perfect and easy to use , I would purchase again</li>
    <li> Nice concept. I like how my eyebrows look. They are tattooed on but I did like how inside the lines look more natural. This stick does the trick on making them look flawless all day.  Very happy. The reviews helped me alot.</li>
    <li> There are cheaper alternatives that are just as good.  I will not purchase again, this does the same job as a cheaper option.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice! it puts your eyebrows in their place! I find it to wear off a bit over time just reapply and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Love it and I will use it again and again. Highly recommended for unruly eyebrows. Will order more soon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> After trimming my eyebrows this really tames them into shape where they stay all day. This will last a long time I am sure as it only takes a little for each brow.</li>
    <li> I love this Brow Shaper, it does what it says, Hold and reshape the brows in an excellent way without giving that solid apperance to the brows, this because of its oily wax texture \\&quot;I guess\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I really like this to hold my eyebrows and place Great product!</li>
    <li> Good quality product. It was exactly what I was expecting. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this! Easy to use and it works!</li>
    <li> keeps your brows in place making them look as if you got them done. worth buyin it!</li>
    <li> It hold eyebrows temporary.</li>
    <li> OMG this eyebrow wax is about the best thing ever.  I bought it to tame my brows before penciling but honestly it shapes and darkens them just enough that on a casual day I won&#x27;t even apply the pencil after.  If I do full makeup, I will pencil and powder over the wax and it doesn&#x27;t interfere, just gives that needed bit of adhesive to set the brow makeup I apply over it.  Have used gels and clear mascara for this in the past but this wax pencil is by far the best and easiest to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to order about four more of them so I have one with me at all times.  Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> Amazing, I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before and as always it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Good product. The FREIGHT is too HIGH at 5.98 for such a small item...  After using for a while not sure I will buy it again..</li>
    <li> Does the job of helping brow powder stay on longer.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me and It didn&#x27;t do my eyebrows any different from what I do now. Nothing!</li>
    <li> I love NYX products, this works perfectly to keep my brow hairs in place. It goes on and stays on.</li>
    <li> I love this NYX eye brow shaper wax pencil! So glad I gave it a chance - much better than the eye brow gel mascara tools I&#x27;ve been using, b/c this wax pencil allows for more precision and it has staying power!</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use.  The crayon type tip is so much better than getting wax on a brush then applying.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps keep unruly brows in place.</li>
    <li> Seals the eyebrows into place without a waxed look.</li>
    <li> Great product. I think this may end my long search for the ideal eyebrow enhancer…I just put a light layer of the wax on my brows to shape them, then follow with powder or pencil. This leaves my brows looking groomed and enhanced, yet completely natural. Also, no messy brushes to deal with, and no worries about the color being &#x27;off.&#x27;  Wish I had found this product years ago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried ay other eyebrow wax shaper before, but this works pretty well and I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Not sure how I ever got along without this!</li>
    <li> Great product that allows any powdered eyebrow product to cling on to. Very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> The NYX Brow  Shaper Wax .was melted ..I opened the tube  up and the tip was broken and melted..I had to dig the tip out of plastic lid .Then I had to set it on top of pencil and smash it into a round mound on top of pencil..So there is not a pointed tip to it..Also that small pencil they delivered it into a shoebox size box ..Waste of shipping box..Better in a yellow envelope and putting in the mailbox instead of that over large box ..I smeared some on my eyebrows and forgot to wash my face before bedtime  this morning my brows where still in place.. I put it on after the organic eyebrow pencil and it was waxy,but I used a Brow comb to shape it in place Now I gotta buy a large pencil sharpener  to find out if product works better with a pointed tip. I wish it was not broken when it arrived .I&#x27;ll check reviews to see if others got a broken melted tip.Amazon should send me a replacement since I&#x27;ve spent alot of money through out the years for their products.</li>
    <li> This definitely works. Very easy to use and sets my bushy brows in place all day and doesn&#x27;t mess with my brow powder underneath. It doesn&#x27;t leave a glossy look for too long, which I love.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow wax ever.</li>
    <li> Was really hoping this would work better than a brow gel, but it doesn&#x27;t. Should last me quite a while, but I likely won&#x27;t repurchase. Nice texture and easy to use, but it doesn&#x27;t keep my brows in place.</li>
    <li> I love how it shapes my brows and tame it into place. This one is clear so it does not leave any marks on your brows and keeps it in place all day. It doesnt feel waxy when I apply it and the best part is that it contains vitamin E. Definitely a good add to my makeups. :)</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are literally so thin and scraggly and barely there and this little magic stick put the few hairs i have in place, i feel so much better about my appearance lol.</li>
    <li> It was just not the product I needed since my eyebrows are completely gone. I thought it was the wax used to remove hair.</li>
    <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t a pencil pencil, but the wax could be pushed up as needed, like lipstick. That said, this product is an excellent value for the money, does exactly what it advertises. My eyebrows never seem to want to stay put and this quickly and easily does the trick. Doesn&#x27;t make them look gelled or even feel strange like many other products.</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow shaper! i ordered it..not really knowing wtf it was. But when i used it i loved it. First i plucked my eyebrows then used the eyebrow brush to brush my eyebrows into a style of my liking, and filled in any areas. i then went over my eyebrows with the wax and they kept my eyebrows in place the whole night. Even through sweating... I really love this product and when i run out i&#x27;ll order another.</li>
    <li> For the price, I LOVE this product. It goes on good, but not too heavy. I do not color in my eyebrows, so I really like this product to keep my natural brows in place. I wish that it had a little more sticky power (similar to a dried gel), but overall it really is a great product. And the little pencil actually lasts longer than I expected too!&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems sharpening the pencil, as other reviewers did. Already had a sharpener that easily fit the wider than normal shape.</li>
    <li> Love this defenetly buying again</li>
    <li> Love this stick!!! I&#x27;m an Esthetician and have tried brush on and wand brow holders that just do not compare to this wax stick. It works great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of brow gels and nothing else comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product holds brows firmly (and I mean firmly!) in place and is ridiculously easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is colorless, odorless, and compact. I haven&#x27;t sharpened it yet so can&#x27;t speak to whether or not that&#x27;s easy but I&#x27;m definitely a fan.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and keep those &amp;#34;frisky&amp;#34; brows in tow.  Love this as it comes as a stick application versus what I have used in the past with fingers.  Use and then use an eyebrow brush to apply brows.</li>
    <li> Works fine and a great help.</li>
    <li> It is really waxy and you have to press hard to apply it to the brows.  I was hoping for a softer or moister product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my eyebrows look perfectly in shape. Definitely buy more than one, because I wish I did</li>
    <li> I think this is the best eyebrow wax I&#x27;ve gotten so far. It picks up the pigments of the eyebrow powder (I use Anastasia&#x27;s brow powder). I like how you can percisely distribute the wax, and it really does last all day. All day! I am a full time student, train-commuter, and work 30 hours a week. This wax lasts from 5am-12am. I am impressed with this product since I have oily skin too. I will buy again and recommend this to others who are looking for a new wax to try. The only down side is that when you sharpen the pencil, there is so much wax that is lost with the sharpening- perhaps I could do an old-school method to save more product. Anyway, this makes me sad since this is ~$8 to buy.</li>
    <li> Waxy without the shine.  This product helps keep my eyebrows nicely shaped and I can even re-apply make up over the wax.</li>
    <li> This works okay. It doesn&#x27;t really help secure your brow shape. Gels work better. If you&#x27;re happy with the shape of your brows, and you just want a little security, this will work fine. I need a little more.</li>
    <li> The hair in my brows has never grown in the same (upward and out) direction. This holds every hair perfectly in place.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good, it almost feels as a conditioner for the eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use to much be careful.&lt;br /&gt; I use it for multiple things.&lt;br /&gt;Nail art (keeps nail polish from staining my skin)&lt;br /&gt;When my jackets zipper is sticking I put this all along the zipper. I&#x27;m sure I can write more uses it has but I&#x27;ll leave it at that.</li>
    <li> Works exactly how i thought it would😀😀</li>
    <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
    <li> This is great for unruly brows. Goes on well and not to thick. Does not melt off and it gives my brows a professional look</li>
    <li> Perfect and easy to apply. Not even visible. Just make sure you have a sharpener.</li>
    <li> Awesome works all day</li>
    <li> wife loves them cant find them in stores anymore</li>
    <li> This product has changed how I see my eyebrows! I don&#x27;t even wear makeup on them regularly anymore, I swear they have never looked better. The hairs all grow in the perfect direction against my skin now (no hairs awkwardly sticking up these days) and they grow fuller now also! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I have thick, black eyebrows that get out of control. This pencil has been great to shape and work as a base for my eyebrow powder. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks; I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it sharpens once it gets dull, but for now I love it.</li>
    <li> This just don&#x27;t last on my brows, I bought it because of the reviews and I was so exited about it, but them I tried and this does not last at all. is nice in the beginning, nice consistency, but 5 minutes after I apply this to my brows, my brows go back to the same way the were before. Does anyone knows about any other eye brows wax that will actually hold my brows in place???? for real??? please.</li>
    <li> I love this product... I bought it at the same time as the brow powder duo also made by NYX I believe... this is so easy to use... I find myself using it and skipping brow powder. Fool proof and fast... now if it also added color, it&#x27;d be perfect! But keeps my brows in place, which I love.</li>
    <li> I recently ran out of the wax that was provided with my brow powder and had been just skipping it but became annoyed by how easily it would diminish throughout the day so I ventured out for a replacement.  Luckily I found this product that didn&#x27;t require me to buy a whole new brow pack (I have light hair so I only need a bit of powder so it always lasts longer than the wax).  It works better than the wax that was provided originally AND I love the shape/super convenient for the shape of your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I like this. Helps you from coloring out of the lines you might say. Only prob is now I gotta buy a pencil sharpener for the big eye liner.</li>
    <li> Love this eye brow wax shaper! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this daily. Its weight is just right to tame course eyebrow hair. I&#x27;m spoiled now and will reorder as soon as I&#x27;m running low.</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> Although I loved the way this made my eyebrows look (shiny, shaped), I realized it was making my skin breakout. I do have sensitive skin, so it may have no effect on anyone else.</li>
    <li> Great pencil. It makes doing my brows so much easier.</li>
    <li> I work as a MUA and LOVE this product.  It keeps unruly brows where they need to be without being too sticky or too stiff.  I use it on top of any brow makeup and it helps it to stay in place.  LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Great price, does the job and tames brows after applying color.</li>
    <li> Love it! What a difference it makes!</li>
    <li> Works really well in helping brows stay in place. Though if you have darker colored brows you have to be careful to not let any chunks of wax show.</li>
    <li> I have the most difficult time getting my eyebrows to lay neetly.  This pencil put them into place and they stayed.  Wish I had this product a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today, and let me just say I love. It works just like all the other wax pencils I&#x27;ve bought in the past, if not better for cheaper. Shipping was great, in fact I got it earlier than expected and it can all nicely packaged which was nice. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is thinking about buying something like this but doesn&#x27;t want to pay so much.</li>
    <li> Great product. I apply to my eyebrows before applying powder and it keeps my brows looking perfect all day. I set it with clear mascara as well to keep hairs in place.</li>
    <li> Just what you need.  One light  swipe and brush and your brows really look nice and stay that way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non greasy, non sticky, kept my eyebrows in place for the most part. It&#x27;s cute, easy to use and worth it.</li>
    <li> I was used to using e.l.f.&#x27;s brow gel that looked like a mascara tube. It was great but really heavy. NYX&#x27;s product is light, easy to apply, and lasts all day. Definitely will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works like a charm and you need to get some now if you want your brows to stay in place without gluing them in place with hair spray and having that horrible, crunchy feeling on your forehead.</li>
    <li> this is awesome stuff - keeps your  eyebrows in place and neat - you can take it with you easy to store - I would absolutely buy it again however, it looks like it will last for sometime!&lt;br /&gt;No nasty smell not over powering easy to apply - Glad I found it!</li>
    <li> This was perfect in taming my eyebrow. I&#x27;ve tried other waxes and none of them has kept my eyebrows in place like this one.</li>
    <li> Seller prompt, price great! this is the best ever. It looks great after you wax your eyebrows they stay put just add this to eyebrows looks professional ladies. I have to order another one.</li>
    <li> Nice wax--make sure to blend it in and also that no powder gets in it, otherwise, does a nice job of controlling brows.  I also use mine to line my lips to keep lipstick from bleeding.</li>
    <li> I liked it. Thinking it&#x27;s not really my thing. But great product.</li>
    <li> Works good on runaway brow hairs</li>
    <li> Very dry and waxey - and not in a good way. Slightly white color because it&#x27;s so dry. My daughter wants to keep it though.</li>
    <li> An excellent tool if you find yourself to be like me post chemo... with curly, unmanagable eyebrows!  It is a real life saver!</li>
    <li> Does the job with ease.</li>
    <li> This is pretty standard brow wax in a convenient pencil form. It works quite well, but don&#x27;t count on the cap to stay on! It&#x27;s pretty loose and comes off easily, so I don&#x27;t recommend throwing this in a purse</li>
    <li> You might not even need pencil or shadow filler with this, because it really shapes and holds the brows. If I use pencil or shadow, I like to put that on first, then the wax shaper.</li>
    <li> Love this stick as it is perfect for swipe over my brows for a finishing touch and my brows stay in its place all day and looks perfect until I remove my make up at nigh.  Love and will be ordering several more to keep a good stock.</li>
    <li> When I need my eyebrows to stay, this makes them STAY. It&#x27;s pretty much like a gluestick for eyebrows. If you use NYX eyebrow powder, this is your best friend.</li>
    <li> Great price for this great product</li>
    <li> I do not think it is a very good product. The brows still go different ways and I was hoping they would lay down flat.I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m getting older, my brows are thinning and this wax pencil allows the brow pencil to fill in.  I searched the stores in my area and no one had what I wanted.  This works great and the pencil marks stay on all day.</li>
    <li> This wax pencil is perfect for shaping or setting the pencil/powder on your brows.  I&#x27;ve lost my eyebrows and it has been very challenging drawing them in but couldn&#x27;t complete the feat without this tool.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best but It&#x27;s still convenient to have on days you want to be lazy with your brows.</li>
    <li> I love the pencil, it holds my brow powder and pencil perfectly.  It also allows me to extend the end of my brows a little longer.</li>
    <li> I used to use a more expensive brand of wax that looked very similar to the NYX wax. I like this one just as much and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.  It holds my brows in place.</li>
    <li> keeps my eyebrows in place all day! i saw this product in a youtube video and knew i had to have it</li>
    <li> Makes my brows look perfect! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> arrived well , I like it, but do not know how to use it to its full extent. when I apply it over my brows, they do not stay put and they are not even hairy. will learn how tho.</li>
    <li> This tool was exactly wh a r I needed to groom my eyebrows. Works great and highly recimmended.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Bought this based on previous reviews and am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I found a way to control my wild eyebrow hairs and they look lovely now. No wax build up and no alien shine. Press hairs down as firmly as you wish. Then apply color over.</li>
    <li> This is the first time using an eye brow shaper so I&#x27;m not sure if this is how they work or not.  This one has to be applied frequently.  It dries up very quickly.</li>
    <li> When I bought it, i believe that this pencil contains removal wax, but I was wrong, it is a shaper, it works really good. My eye brows are rebel, and this shaper define them very well.</li>
    <li> Where has this product been all my life!  I needed this years ago for my eyebrows.  I did not know a thing about eyebrow wax pencils, but I am glad I do now.  They do an amazing job, and make up entire eyes look so professionally done.  I will always use wax pencils from now on.</li>
    <li> just like the rest of their products, works well and is just as advertised,i have recommended these products to my friends.</li>
    <li> I use Anastasia powder for my brows but need this for it to stick and last all day. The circumference fits all average large sharpeners, I use sephoras dual small/large sharpener.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto.  Recomendable</li>
    <li> I have thinning wayward brows, and saw this, priced very reasonably,Wow!  I just &amp;#34;lightly&amp;#34; go over my brow definition, apply my brow powder, brush to blend and I don&amp;#34;t have to worry about fading away until I take it off @ nite.  Great &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; product!</li>
    <li> LOVE!! Works SO GOOD! Very Happy</li>
    <li> I wish I discovered the sooner it makes such a difference and definitely keeps my eyebrow in place and make it last longer</li>
    <li> NYX has done it again. They have the best products for cheap. This keeps your brows in perfect shape and even seems to add a little texture to them. This is all I will use on my browns now.</li>
    <li> This is a dream come true. I have thin eyebrows that like to stray away. This helps keep every last hair in their place. I use it as a primer before putting on my eyebrow makeup! Awesome combination.</li>
    <li> holds eyebrow hair down and straight but really really exensive!!!  wish i could fine a cheaper one</li>
    <li> Hi my product never came with any instructions so I have no idea how to use it</li>
    <li> This is a good stick, but not great.  It does smooth out your eyebrow application, but doesn&#x27;t seem to stay around as long as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t use this before. Keeps the brows MUCH more tamed looking.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how this work.</li>
    <li> Perfect for shaping without using a ton of product that makes your brows look fake. I love it. It compares to clear mascara, but with more staying power.</li>
    <li> Nice one long lasting</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected. Held all my eyebrow hairs together!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product I was thinking it was a better product but is not. I DON&#x27;T recommended!</li>
    <li> This stuff help shape your brows. I use it before applying pencil or brow mascara. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for all eyebrow colors. Very natural.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow wax is great. It&#x27;s not too greasy and it does keep your brows in place most of the day. It is still wax so there is a bit of the waxy feeling. Just groom them with a eyebrow brush and they&#x27;ll stay in place. I gave it three stars because this wax will get the job done but you do not want to use it every day. And if you over do it they&#x27;ll look gelled on. So use a light hand and and eye brow brush and you&#x27;ll be set</li>
    <li> This Eye Brow Wax is the best for making your eye brows look finished.  It makes sure that they stay in place.  I think this is a must have for all women.</li>
    <li> I love this eye brow wax shaper and can&#x27;t do without it, I use it all the time - the result is amazing!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to try something like this. I like it a lot. Keeps my brows in place and helps me get a nice arch, too...cooool!</li>
    <li> Well I got this product because it was cheap.  I&#x27;ve been using Anastasia wax pencil for brows and that&#x27;s an expensive investment but it works ($20-24).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NYC pencil is nice for its pricing.  The wax is different than Anastasia.  NYC&#x27;s wax is softer and more malleable.  It also camoflauges in really well.  However, it doesn&#x27;t have that strong hold I get from Anastasia&#x27;s pencil.  This holds well but if you happen to rub your forehead, especially with water, you&#x27;re pretty much left with a mess to regroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a budget, this product isn&#x27;t too bad.  But in performance it has its strengths and weaknesses.</li>
    <li> My brows are long and unruly and this product keeps them in place throughout the work day.  I need to get a sharpener.  I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I like this company&#x27;s product. It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great. I like it</li>
    <li> Perfect. Converted to wax from clear gel on my brows and this is SO much better. Longer lasting too.</li>
    <li> Because this isn&#x27;t colored, it isn&#x27;t over-kill.  You can use pretty much any color of powder, so you can try all kinds until you find the perfect shade. It&#x27;s also faster and easier to apply then the colored wax that comes in a compact. Great idea, great price. I wouldn&#x27;t be putting anything on my brows, except they started going grey. Four stars because an ideal solution for brows doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the use of it , I wished it comes with explanation or something .</li>
    <li> its perfect, what can I say. perfect.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It didn&#x27;t shape anything. In fact, I thought it will be better than this. Am I going to buy it again? Of course no. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> not as effective as expected</li>
    <li> I have used eyebrow gel in the past which works better. My eyebrows are stiff so the wax just makes them look greasy and white and doesn&#x27;t provide support. I would have given this one star but I think it will work for people who have finer eyebrow hair.</li>
    <li> I have unruly , thick , coarse brows that grow quick. I have to get threaded we very 2 weeks. This product helps keep my brows looking tame and gives me a higher arch.</li>
    <li> This product worked well to shape brows, it is basically just a sticky wax in pencil form, simple and effective. Just be aware that this pencil is chubbier than most pencils and you need a bigger sized sharpener that will accomodate it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my eyebrows on all day!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is easy to apply and works better than if you would apply wax by makeup brush.</li>
    <li> i never fail to keep buying this wax. it looks very natural and keeps my brows in place all day. i ended up ordering this a second time because i couldn&#x27;t live without it! it also lasted me a good 4-6 months before i had to end up buying another.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It tames unruly brow hair. I would highly recommend this product. You have to purchase a wide opening sharpener for the product.</li>
    <li> The product is great to use when your grooming your eyebrows. I know I purchased a wax product, but this items gets kind of greasy when I wear my eyebrow pencil which is not the look I wanted. Oh and the price just about sent me to the hospital I purchased a few more items when I purchased this item so I really didn&#x27;t notice I was charged $14 for something that&#x27;s worth $3 or I can purchase for $4 sent a email to seller about the charge no response never will I purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like it. Makes the eyebrow look more together.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase. I will be buying another one. Makes my eyebrows look even better than without it. I decided to test it out and loved it. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try it sooner. And I get compliments about them.</li>
    <li> If you love having perfectly shaped eyebrows, you need this!</li>
    <li> It is fine for an inexpensive product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t hold my eyebrows in place and the wax is visible.  Not working.</li>
    <li> this keeps my unruly brows in place when I av new growths&lt;br /&gt;very nice makeup purse must have. NYX muah!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference between use this product or not.</li>
    <li> This NYX brow shaper wax is awesome!  I love how it locks in my concealer and gives me a nice finished look that lasts all day.  Would recommend to anyone and will def keep a few pencils in my caboodle.!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Seems smaller than I thought it would be for $6 but it seems to work. Sharpening it may be a problem if it gets sticky.</li>
    <li> I was using a very good quality (read expensive) brand of brow wax before trying this one. There is no difference in how this product performs. It goes on smoothly, stays on as well, and sharpens just as efficiently as the expensive version. I use it to keep my brows tamed and also as a base/primer to support powdered brow colors.</li>
    <li> This brow wax is great because i use before i put on my brow shadow. It helps keep all of the stray brows in place before i apply my brow shadow. Sometimes i wear the brow wax by itself and it gives my brows a nice groomed look to them. A great buy.</li>
    <li> holds stray brow hairs that don&#x27;t want to lay down.  Easy to use.  Works even on odd grey wild hairs.</li>
    <li> Its great! Holds eyebrows in place, and is not white, or horribly sticky. It&#x27;s an invisible eyebrow holder, that doesn&#x27;t wash off until told to, and is just what I was looking for. Simply perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this, especially since i have super thin eye brows it makes what little hair i do have look thicker and stay put.</li>
    <li> This is not suitable for people with full and unruly brows because it will not hold the hairs in place. For thinner brows, I can see this product as being efficient. I switched to using the Anastasia Brow Gel and it was amazing!! I know it was quite pricey but just watch for a good deal at Ulta because it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this wax pencil. I had doubts that I would like it but it works pretty well. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This Eye Brow Shaper Wax keeps my eyebrows tamed very well, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about having caterpillar as eyebrows!</li>
    <li> This brow wax works well enough, only I wish it lasted longer and didn&#x27;t need to be re-applied during the day.  Perhaps my brows are just extra unruly - ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, this product works just as well as the more expensive designer brand and is less than half the price.</li>
    <li> this item is exactly as advertised. works well. i have had no issues with the product thus far. overall, this product is worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> One of the best eyebrow wax pencils I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeybrow wax pencil. I&#x27;ve never used one of these before. Works better than wax with a brush. This got my eyebrows under control and made them look thicker with cleaner lines. I used NYX Eyebrow Cake Powder with this. My eyebrows look great - more defined and darker. Product arrived quickly. I should have purchased a sharper though.</li>
    <li> I have very light eyebrows and purchased several brands of eyebrow color (including Anastasia). This product helps the color stay on much longer. I will be buying it again when I&#x27;ve used this one.</li>
    <li> Great product and really works. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I love it. I had no idea anything like this existed and now I wonder how I managed without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sparse eyebrow hair and this pencil basically pulls them together into a cohesive force until you have a nice, organized dark eyebrow line. Although, this works even better if you already have your eyebrows shaped. Unfortunately it did not work as well on my mother who has extremely sparse eyebrows. So I had to darken her eyebrows with a pencil and then used it. Worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I recently paid double what I purchased this product for at an outside store.  NYX brand of brow wax was as good if not better than the one I purchased at double the price!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product - make my unruled eyebrows instantly nice looking! It is not a sticky type of wax so nice to put on! I do not use eyebrows pencil if this wax is used.  Easy to clean too.  1 lasts for a few good months if use everyday.  Strongly recommended!</li>
    <li> Two stars only because I&#x27;m personally not a fan of brow wax pencils. I prefer the brow gels. This product doesn&#x27;t last and left my eyebrows looking greasy and stuck together. Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t know how to apply it, but I would definitely recommend other products and brands for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I use the wax on my practically non-existent eyebrows and them fill them in with powder and this wax is perfect for that.  Better than the expensive Sephora stuff I&#x27;d be buying before</li>
    <li> this stuff keeps my crazy brows in check all day long. great price and long-lasting. no issues with application at all. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, makes my eyebrows look gorgeous!!</li>
    <li> Works perfect! I will buy this again</li>
    <li> I love it. It works far better than clear mascara.</li>
    <li> I love nyx products but it was a smaller size than what I expected.  It was more if a trial size</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it works.  Light wax which holds my crazy brows in shape.  Goes on smoothly and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a wax pencil for my brows to keep them in shape and I finally found one I love. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I was expecting with all the other reviews but it isn&#x27;t too bad and works better than any other option I&#x27;ve tried for unruly eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Nice, soft wax pencil that keeps my eyebrows looking good. I don&#x27;t have completely funky eyebrows, I just use this to smooth out my look and keep a few wonky hairs in place and it works well for this. I read another review comparing it to candle wax, but it&#x27;s not like that at all to me. The wax is soft enough to go on your eyebrows easily, but not so soft that it comes off in clumps. I love using this with my eyebrow powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: I received and used this product during a warm Summer.  I will add to my review if the consistency of the wax pencil changes in the Winter with our house temp dropping by 10-15 degrees.</li>
    <li> Not Amazing But Pretty Good For The Price, It Gets The Job Done. Would Of Given It Five Stars If It Had A Sharpener When Mines Got Below The Tip I Could No Longer Apply It Which Made It Feel Like A Sample Since It Ran Down So Quickly I Don&#x27;t Feel As Though I Got My Moneys Worth.</li>
    <li> I should have read the description a little closer when I ordered this product as it is not a waxing tool, it is a pencil that leaves a layer of wax on your brows to make them stay in place. It works well for what it is, it just isn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it was!</li>
    <li> my eyebrows are so unruly, I have tried a lot of products for them, but love,love this one</li>
    <li> Excellent product allows you to put the wax exactly where you want it on your brow - I love it and it&#x27;s size is good on the fingers and hand to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I tried the eyebrow wax because I was beginning to think the gel was too conspicuous on my brows. I have somewhat stubborn brows - not stubborn enough that a little brow gel won&#x27;t hold them in place, but not flexible enough that they can hold themselves up. This shaper wax would hold my brow hairs in place for maybe 15 minutes before it&#x27;d become ineffective. I think it&#x27;s because the sheer heat on my face melts the wax off my brows. I don&#x27;t know - I&#x27;m going back to gel. It&#x27;s just much more reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case anyone&#x27;s wondering, you need to buy the NYX pencil duo sharpener to sharpen this.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware they even made a wax brow shaper!  Now, I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Keeps brows in place without being heavy.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products that are supposed to tame my wayward brows.  This one works!!  And if your brows misbehave all you have to do is push them back into place.  Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The inside portion of one my eyebrows grows straight up instead of outward like the rest of the hairs, and I&#x27;ve been fighting it forever.... This is like a miracle that&#x27;s been sent to me. I can just draw over that section a few times and it keeps everything in place and looking normal haha. I use it over a colored brow powder and my eyebrows have never looked better. I&#x27;ll use this forever!</li>
    <li> Very good! but Hard to find a sharpener</li>
    <li> I like this product, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Got this item yesterday, it arrived really quick which was a plus! I have really thick eyebrows so it helps keep them in place. i love it. thanks.</li>
    <li> Purchased this used it found that it actually makes my brow hair fall off. Stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I had some left over Halloween wax to shape my eyebrows that was applied with a tiny brush, and I noticed how good it worked to shape my eyebrows. When I ran out I tried to find more in the stores, but nobody carried it. I was happy to find a wax pencil on Amazon. This wax pencil works great for me. I have full natural eyebrows that I keep shaped and plucked and the pencil keeps them nicely defined. I only gave it four stars because I&#x27;ve noticed when applied cold the wax flaked off just a little bit, but warmed with my finger that goes away. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love this brow shaper wax.  My only complaint- it doesn&#x27;t come with a sharpener, so I&#x27;m going to have to search for a way to sharpen the pencil.</li>
    <li> Just ok, didn&#x27;t really hold down the unruly hairs.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow wax kept my bushy eyebrows in place. I recommend it for people with bushy, thick eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This product is very useful for those stubborn eyebrows. Gives you a natural look. I will buy again well worth the $$$$$</li>
    <li> great product. I love how it leaves my eye brows in place and so smooth. works great with my dipbrow.</li>
    <li> this shaper wax  pen make your eye brown stay where there is suppost  to stay i love it and i truly recommended to any pretty girl with pretty eyebrown like mine</li>
    <li> I think a Wax Pencil is 1 of the little tricks a person can use to make their Brows look Fantastic!  Practice!</li>
    <li> I loved this Wax Pencil very easy to apply and use. It def does its job i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best eyebrow product I&#x27;ve ever tried. Love, love, love it. The wax keeps my brows groomed without them looking oily.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Tames eyebrows very well, does not look glossy nor matted. Eyebrows retain the style through out the day.</li>
    <li> This item works very well.  I have long, somewhat curly eyebrows and this holds them in place perfectly without looking glued down.  You actually can&#x27;t even tell you have it on unless you use way too much.  Great for days when you wake up and you have stray hairs sticking out or going a weird direction but you don&#x27;t want to pluck or trim them.  Perfect for quick fixes and after about two minutes of having it on you no longer feel the wax which is great!  It even holds up in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll get a funny feeling when you take food out of the stove and the heat hits the wax tho! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this wax because I have naturally curly hair &amp; sometimes my brows reflect that haha. It does a great job keeping my brows in good shape.</li>
    <li> I feel like I was looking for this product my whole life....my eyebrows are always getting out of hand and this puts them in place!  I love this, don&#x27;t know what I would do without it now.</li>
    <li> Keeps eyebrows nice and shaped</li>
    <li> Keeps ur brows in place I will be buying again to have my back up</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t actually keep hairs intact for long. Messes up quickly.</li>
    <li> really works!! Now I have sexy eyebrows without spending $20 on wet eyebrow gel!! My brow stay put and it has a clean not greasy look</li>
    <li> NYX did it again! This product keeps my brows looking sharp and neat.</li>
    <li> I bought the NYX Eye Brow Shaper Wax to replace the much more expensive Anastasia brand that I ran out of.  This product is the exact same, at a better price.  I am really sold on NYX.  Haven&#x27;t had a bad experience with their cosmetic products yet.</li>
    <li> I really love this wax stick. First, it makes my brows just a little darker, which is a plus for me. If you have curly eyebrows or brows that just won&#x27;t lay right, this will take care of that problem right away. I have relatively thin eyebrows, so it takes two coats to tame my brows to lay just right. I recommend putting this on before you use brow pencil, lest you risk smudging your labor of lines.</li>
    <li> So easy to use and it keeps those eyebrow hairs in place.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a sharpener. I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my 92 year old mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This is not working for me at all, my brows are the same as before I used..hairs do not stay in place for long and I used it as specified.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product was horrible. It didn&#x27;t stick my eyebrows in one place like it says. The pencil won&#x27;t sharpen right and it is most definately not worth it. If you want to try something don&#x27;t try this product.</li>
    <li> Wow.  I love this wax pencil.  Really love it.  It far exceeds the products I was using prior to this one.  It holds my brows in shape much longer than anything else I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s so easy to apply.  I won&#x27;t be trying any other products now--I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This product helps keep your eyebrows in place. Gives you that polished look.I also learned about this on dhukai.com. The product I bought was inexpensive,helps when you&#x27;re out of work for 3 months for sugery.</li>
    <li> i cant rly c a difference with this shaper wax. its a little to oily for my liking and honestly it is something i could do with out as i said does rly not do much to my eyebrows after two hours on i cant even c that i applied it on. my friend says she sees a little difference when she applys it on herself. so idk mayb its just me, i guess its not bad for the price though.</li>
    <li> The ONLY issue I have with this product is I have yet to find a sharpener that actually fits it. I have bought so many &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; sharpeners and NONE have been big enough :(</li>
    <li> seems to work as advertised, but a little pricey</li>
    <li> I love it. I have used brow gel but this seems to work better!</li>
    <li> not very good quality.</li>
    <li> I could see how this wax may work for anyone with pretty fine eyebrow hairs. However, I have very thick, almost wiry eyebrows and this wax does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied!! :) my eyebrows are hard to tame, and I wanted them to have an arch. I didn&#x27;t want to shave off the ends of my eyebrows just so I can draw in the arch. Luckily this stuff is amazing. It gave me the arch, tamed my eyebrows, and I get to keep them!:) it&#x27;s also very compact.</li>
    <li> Makes you look like you have put on eyebrow color.  Great.</li>
    <li> Great product...goes on smooth, lasts a long time.  Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wished it included a sharpener made for the size of this pencil (wider opening).</li>
    <li> Hands down best wax brow pencil out there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to fully tame my brows. I came across this on Amazon on accident and decided to give it a go. It makes everything stay in place and gives great definition. Makes my brows stay in place all day.</li>
    <li> What was this product really about had spent my money for no reason, very upsetting! I was beyond pissed at that fact &#x27;&#x27;/</li>
    <li> buy the Anastasia one. this one is not a good one</li>
    <li> I never knew an eyebrow wax could help with my fine eyebrows. I have blonde naturally thin eyebrows and this help holds down the fine hairs and it works perfectly with the E.L.F. Eyebrow kit. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I think better if you have stray eye brows, not that much of an issue. If I apply before or after my eye brow powder it comes off on the pencil.  Have no idea what will happen when I have to sharpen it.</li>
    <li> This wax pencil makes doing my brows quick and easy.  I use this pencil to shape my eyebrows perfectly, then fill in my brows with eyeshadow.  I then comb through my brows with a brow brush until all the shadow and wax is well distributed and diffused - i come out with perfectly sculpted brows every time!</li>
    <li> This product is too waxy and is hard to put on. I might as well have just put candle wax on my brows. Not a winner.</li>
    <li> I have tried to apply this as carefully and as lightly as I can, but it still seems to take out an eyebrow hair or two each time I use it.  Unfortunately, the whole point was to preserve my eyebrows since I&#x27;m losing them as I age!  So this is not helpful.  Other than that, this product works OK.  But I would have to say that I do not recommend it for what I had intended it for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I was without it. Before I wanted to but pencil from Anastasia, but decided to buy something cheaper. So I don&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> This pencil leaves a thin waxy line on your brow and eyebrow power adheres better.  An application results in a shapelier eyebrow.  Much improved over the wax you apply with a small brush.  I think this product is an essential beauty supply and at a very reasonable price.  One pencil lasts for a very long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect if you have unrully hair on brows and you have little of it. It&#x27;s not too greasy, It causes the hair to stick together and stay put. It allows the power to go on Smoother, Overall happy with the product and price.</li>
    <li> I love it it works Reallly good</li>
    <li> works great! I LOVE IT...</li>
    <li> It kind of helps to keep eyebrows neat, but need to be used in combination with threading/ shaping etc. doesn&#x27;t give oily look like other similar products.</li>
    <li> It totally works. Keeps brows in place, not oily. Very pleased. Would buy again! Good price. I use it after I fill in the brows</li>
    <li> Works great and keeps my eyebrows neat and tidy after filling them i.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and it works well!</li>
    <li> Excellent in the beginning but went down really fast and I didn&#x27;t have a pencil sharpener that was fat enough for it and so I had to use a pen knife which was a pain.  I left it and moved to moustache wax - far easier.</li>
    <li> Way better than the clear mascara and brow gel I used to use!  This keeps my brows in place all day long.  A couple of tips:  I apply this BEFORE I apply my eye shadow because if you do it after, it can smear and remove your shadow.  I also brush my brows with a brow brush after I apply for a more natural look.  Wish I&#x27;d found this stuff years ago!</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY WORKS GREAT</li>
    <li> colorless brow wax does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  A good buy!</li>
    <li> Holds all your stray, unruly eyebrows in place. Bravo!</li>
    <li> Works great on eyebrows with gray hair....keeps those &amp;#34;resistant&amp;#34; brow hairs in place all day.</li>
    <li> This is a handy way to keep eye brows in check. Believe me I tried a lot of stuff and this works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other brow sealants and this is my favorite.  It is a wax, so personally, I like the hold a lot better.  The price is very good and you only have to use a tiny bit of the product each time so I know the pencil will last a long time.  I like the product a lot.</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m in a rush and only have time to do a few things before heading out the door, this would be one I grab. It makes my brows have a more precise look. Not sticky. Does exactly what I want it to do. Holds all day but comes off easily when I wash my face for the night. This is definitely a must-have for my makeup bag. ❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Used this the first time today.  Worked well.  You can build up with as little or much you need for your look.  I&#x27;m trying to train my brows to go upwards on the inner edge for a more squared effect there.  This creates the effect I want with out the hard crispy feel of clear gel.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It keeps my stray brow hairs in place. I apply it last, after brow color and it works well for me. I have nothing bad to say about except that it WILL NOT keep your cow licks down (my left brow has a &amp;#34;cow lick&amp;#34; where it sticks up on one end lol). That, and I wish there were more of it! If you use it consistently and if you apply it heavily, you&#x27;re going to go through it pretty quickly. Less is definitely more with this one; you don&#x27;t need a lot so keep a light hand when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;ve found NYX is always good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I have bushy brows and this is the only product that I rely on. I used to use clear mascara but it would often flake or shine. With the shaper wax, I can apply and brush my brows into place, confident that they will stay for the whole day. The wax is smooth, not hard, and makes for easy adjustments and tweaks. This product is now in my must have list and seems to last quite a while with regular use.</li>
    <li> This product does the job..so I cannot complain however I only use it once and I am still evaluating this tool for eyebrow.</li>
    <li> It keeps your eyebrows in place. Good product.</li>
    <li> lasts all day for nice and defined brows. doesn&#x27;t leave any clumps behind and looks completely natural!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it like twice. Keeps my eyebrows in place the whole day.</li>
    <li> Shouldn&#x27;t be as expensive but its my favorite.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is small, I wish there were bigger sizes, but other than the size, the product itself is really quite nice. It does shape and hold down my brows, and I am sure that it will continue to do this after i put my actual brow pencil on. I will be more than likely buying more of these.</li>
    <li> Works just like it should I like it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and shipped fast!</li>
    <li> This brow shaper does not hold your brows in place.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference! It didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brow wax!!! I cannot believe anyone would be the prices for high end brow wax when Nyx offers something so comparable.</li>
    <li> I have been using makeup for years.  My only downfall was succeeding in making the great eyebrow.  The shaper wax helps align or tidy up the brow hairs before or after applying brow color.  It will not change the makeup color as it&#x27;s a clear wax.  It&#x27;s come in very handy in helping  me to achieve a very nice finished brow.  The seller&#x27;s service was great, and I&#x27;d recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I used to use the one from Anastasia&#x27;s and this stuff is the exact same but way cheaper!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Better than my Anastasia wax brow shaper.</li>
    <li> Definitely a helpful tool.</li>
    <li> This works great to keep eyebrows in place. I just had to go out and buy a special sharpener at walmart because it is really fat so you can&#x27;t use normal ones.</li>
    <li> Good product. Makes a bade for my thin eye brows looks natural. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very good eye brow shaper. It helps  my eyebrows to stay brushed and in place.</li>
    <li> I loveee it &amp;#60;3 Is just perfect for natural morning routine makeup! Eyebrows on point and natural.</li>
    <li> This just ok, not impressed.</li>
    <li> This is okay, but pulls out brow hair</li>
    <li> I need a sharpener to go with this.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my lipstick from bleeding.  Would work well on eyebrows too!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good make mi brows stay brushed all day long</li>
    <li> This seems to be, and to work like, the product sold under the brand Anastasia which sells for $20! Great bargain.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what you need it to! Absolutely makes my eyes pop, and for a great price.</li>
    <li> I had eyebrows that needed styling,  This brow sharper is a great way to tame your out of control eyebrows and make them look perfect and professionally done.  Now, I get compliments and everyone wants to know my secret for great shaped eye brows.  I recommend NYX brow sharper wax.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Price wise; It&#x27;s very affordable other than Anastasia&#x27;s eye brow wax. With $21 you could buy at least three of these. This product works well on my eyebrows. the only downfall i see about this product is that it does not hold my eyebrows in place for the rest of the day. You can wear it alone or apply some eye brow powder to fill in your brow after applying the NYX eye brow shaper on.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was going to be like the wax that is provided in the NYX eyebrow cake powder, but I was wrong. This reminded me so much of stick glue and I am highly disappointed in it. It does hold done your eyebrows in place but for the cost I would find something else.</li>
    <li> Wow I love it! I was using the ELF eyebrow gel for a long time, but this just feels so much more effective to me. Plus, I just like the way a pencil feels. I feel like I have so much control over placement of each hair. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I simply hate the thing, but at least it taught me to stick with the tried and true.  This dries, flakes and quickly went to the trash.</li>
    <li> NICE NICE NICE, ALL GOOD</li>
    <li> This product is pretty awesome when used properly. I use it as the base for my eye shadow when filling in my brows. It definitely does help hold/shape the brows in place. I would recommend this product to anyone honestly.</li>
    <li> Love my wax pencil, only wish I seen it sooner to order. It holds my brow powder perfectly in place.</li>
