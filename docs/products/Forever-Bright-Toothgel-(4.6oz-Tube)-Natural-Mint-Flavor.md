    <li> I visit the dentist office every 3 months for a check up and every time without fail the dentist will tell me to come back the following week to fill in a cavity. Not only does it get expensive, but it&#x27;s also annoying too to keep driving back &amp; forth to the dentist office. I used Forever Bright Toothgel for 3 months &amp; went back to the dentist office &amp; he told me I didn&#x27;t have anymore new cavities. I was so happy to hear that. Even though the toothgel might be a little pricey, it is totally worth it after all the money I saved on my dental bills. I don&#x27;t even get the toothgel for full price anymore. I get it for 15% off at this website yourchoice.myflpbiz.com</li>
    <li> Any toothpaste without flouride is a good thing. A friend of mine told me about this product and I was not&lt;br /&gt;disappointed, in fact, it&#x27;s the best tasting toothpaste my wife and I have ever used.  This stuff is fantastic,&lt;br /&gt;and now won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Love that i don&#x27;t need to use a lot so it last a little longer. Taste great and definitely did notice my teeth get a bit whiter.</li>
    <li> Did not whiten my teeth and was rather expensive for not doing what I expected.  Taste was okay but I will not buy again</li>
    <li> This toothpaste leaves your teeth feeling very clean. Also acts like a mouth wash. Keeps your breath fresh for hours.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is really great. It has bee propolis in it which is good for infections. This is exactly similar to what I used to buy in Europe from Forever Living Products. I definitely will order it again from this seller. The package came right on time and well packed. The customer service was really courteous. I am glad I order this!</li>
    <li> It is that I want very good tooth past but the price for it and shipping was expensive</li>
    <li> Its a good products although it contains one carcinogen</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. But use fluoride once in a while. Very important. Good with bleeding gums and taste is fine. Enjoy</li>
    <li> Use this daily.  Love it.</li>
    <li> my teeth feel and look good after use.</li>
    <li> Pretty much After just only one use it made my mouth dry. Too bad because I was hoping from the reviews it sounded great. Wasted money, wasted product.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste to use on a daily basis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive gums and since using this product, it has improved tremendously. I like how it taste too. Anyone should try it.&lt;br /&gt;www.flptn.com</li>
    <li> While presented as a natural product it contains sodium lauryl sulfate, a known carcinogen.</li>
    <li> refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;a little expensive though...&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s not too strong or too light, it might be good for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> very pleasant minty taste, foams, does not irritate my sore tongue</li>
    <li> good product, but expensive after adding in the shipping charges</li>
    <li> soothing cooling foamy tasty stuff that last a while but is easy to use frequently.  slight whitening effect and great on gums.  people comment on it... shipped fast shipped well.</li>
    <li> Very good toothpaste. Great for kids.</li>
    <li> I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING AS ALOE TOOHPASTE SO I HAD TO TRY IT  I AM GLAD I DID I LOVE THIS STUFF  GREAT FLAVOR AND MY TEETH LIKE IT TO VERY GOOD FOR SENSITIVE TEETH AS WELL I WILL DEFINITLY BE RE ORDERING AS I RUN OUT  MY NEW GO TO TOOTHPASTE</li>
    <li> Very freshening toothpaste, excellent quality and smell. Also has whitening results with improvement on my gum tissue, highly recommended for anyone who takes care of their teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Love it&#x27;s mild freshness. Gentle on sensitive gums and doesn&#x27;t over dry the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product was really useful for me and for my family as well.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you all guys!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t miss this unique occasion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
    <li> Understand from a friend that using this in conjunction with your regular toothpaste will help your dental checkups immensely when you have gum problems or disease.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely toothgel: no stinging and burning. My mouth feels fresh and clean. I will keep getting this product.</li>
    <li> I just received it, and I tried it. I like the taste and my teeth were left clean. I don&#x27;t know yet if it will do anything to brighten my teeth.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I would purchase it again.  I would also like to see if I can find it cheaper.  Pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> So far, Forever Bright Toothgel has met my teeth expectations in giving me nice and clean teeth! I recommended this product 5 star out of five!!</li>
    <li> It has a very pleasant minty taste. Don&#x27;t have to put a lot of it on the toothbrush for it to have good results. It helped me with my bleeding gums, this is probably due to the effect of Propolis, which not too many other toothpaste brands have. Its hard for me to go back to any other toothpaste because of the great quality and taste. You can buy it at a lesser price by visiting aloeworks.flp.com. There is also a way to get an extra 15% discount off those prices and I can show you how to get it</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever known, is really the best.</li>
