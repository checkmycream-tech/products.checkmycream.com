      <li>, I believe my skin looks younger now than it did in my early 20s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really have a dark knees.</li>
      <li>I know it is too early to see if it will lighten and brighten but listen people after I used it my face had a slight cooling/tingling sensation and my skin felt ALIVE like it was saying thank you like</li>

    <li> I bought this product to help whiten my underarms. Regardless of how often I shave and scrub my underarms, I can&#x27;t seem to rid of the slightly darkness I have in that area. I gotta say, with continuous use - this really works. In fact, it worked so well that I started using it on my face to lighten old acne scars (which it did). A big bonus was that it made my skin SO smooth and soft. I&#x27;m getting ready to purchase my second jar. For me, it was non-irritating. I used it twice a day and saw a difference within the first 7 days.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome ready for a second it really remove marks</li>
    <li> I have pretty amazing skin and I owe it all to this.  I absolutely love it and it keeps me beautiful, wrinkle free, and spot free.  I hope they never stop making it because my skin honestly cannot live without it.  I feel like I have tried everything and it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this cream.  It feels amazing on, always smooth and never greasy.  It smells great and has an iridescent hint to it that gives you a slight glow.  It is a wonderful product.  I would highly HIGHLY recommend it more than any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background about my skin type.  I am full Pilipino with a fairly light complexion.

    <li> This is a great whitening product! I really have a dark knees. My friends and even my mom and siblings always asks me if I have burned my knees cos&#x27; it really is dark! I tried different whitening creams but they just make my knees twice darker. By the way, I&#x27;m asian and a filipino. I have a tan skin color and my knees was thrice darker. But then when I tried using this product if works like magic! I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 weeks and it just keeps on getting fairer. My knees is almost the same color with my skin. I love this product and will keep on buying more!</li>
    <li> yes yes yes.. finally something really works.. I used this cream for more than a month and the results are amazing</li>
    <li> Truly is Magic!&lt;br /&gt;I just received my cream on yesterday and is already pleased with it&#x27;s softness and the way it disappears and just MELT into my skin. I know it is too early to see if it will lighten and brighten but listen people after I used it my face had a slight cooling/tingling sensation and my skin felt ALIVE like it was saying thank you like my pores was breathing?&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to explain and put into words but this is my experience. Even if this cream doesn&#x27;t lighten I am sold and will continue to forever buy this cream, it is soo light and it just absorbs into my faceand it is not greasy or heavy and is excellent under make up or alone.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because I just received yesterday and don&#x27;t really know if it will lighten and I don&#x27;t care besides my ambi cream I will be using this from now on, and by the way I didn&#x27;t care for the soap much though I will stay with Dove  and Amira Magic Cream.</li>
    <li> Fake amira.... it didn&#x27;t help lighten my targeted area.</li>
    <li> I like it and it really works, it helps clear some dark spot, pimples, blemishes and it clear some spot of age lines.</li>
    <li> Not much of a difference but also not used as regularly as recommended.</li>
    <li> Used it for over three weeks&lt;br /&gt;Nothing&lt;br /&gt;Not even a lighter gentle look&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;Had hopes this could be something that would do what it says&lt;br /&gt;But there has been none&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on my knees not worked&lt;br /&gt;A dark spot on my cheek nothing&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing</li>
    <li> Amira magic cream is the best my dark spot in face are gradually fading</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it works!</li>
    <li> I use it for my dark armpits. It took me 5 months to see the results I wanted (I use it every night). I&#x27;m glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and not once has it failed me! I have light skin as is but I originally used it for my elbows and knees and it worked magic! Now I just use it for soft skin and acne treatment which works REALLY well. I was skeptic at first but once I started using it, I never looked back.
