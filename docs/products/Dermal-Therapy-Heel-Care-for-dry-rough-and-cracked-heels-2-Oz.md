<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My feet and hands crack easily on the heels and finger tips. This is the only item I have ever found that actually heals those cracked areas. I have worked as a retail pharmacist for over 30 years, and have recommended this product to many people. This is a great value for a product with 20% urea. Urea is the ingredient that allows the moisture to penetrate the skin. The thicker the callus, the higher the concentration of urea needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent-- this cream REALLY works! And it is not sticky or smelly. My heels are very rough and thick. 2 weeks of daily application smoothed it like baby&#x27;s skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wear flip flops a lot. I swim 5 days a week.  My heels are dry and  cracked. My cuticles are very dry. I&#x27;ve tried Kerasol, Flexitrol, vasoline, heeltastic, etc., none of them worked. Then I was on Amazon&#x27;s site and came across Dermal Therapy Heel.  Well, I tried it and although I don&#x27;t like the tacky feel it leaves (put socks on) after three days of use, my cracks are healing!. This stuff is amazing. And I, at night,  take a tiny amount and rub it into my cuticles and no more dryness. This product is great and  it really works. It&#x27;s the 25% Urea it has in it. I will never waste any more money on other products.  When you have dry cracked heels as I did and dry cuticles you don&#x27;t want to keep throwing your money away on products that don&#x27;t  work. This really works.  I will be buying more. The seller delivered within  three days from my order with Amazon. I say GO FOR IT!</li>
    <li> Nothing works as well as this urea cream for hard skin on feet. - no grinding needed ever again.</li>
    <li> Urea is a kind of magical antidote for dry skin. This superior cr&amp;egrave;me contains 25% of the stuff, a high concentration. And though Dermal Therapy is aimed at dry heels, I use it to fight cracked fingers, instead. There is no better extreme dry skin therapy available, and the 2-ounce jar last quite a long time--this is an excellent value!</li>
    <li> I have eczema on the palm of my hand and thumb as well as as painful cracked heels.  I use this 2-3 times a day and it really helps.  It doesn&#x27;t cure it, of course, but it dramatically reduces the scaling and dryness.   My skin hasn&#x27;t cracked and bleed since I started using it a month ago.  This brand has lanolin in it, which works very well, but has the lanolin odor.  I use this on my feet and another brand of urea cream on my hands.  No perfume too.  The price is reasonable and delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> Always the best for your heels!</li>
    <li> good stuff, and hard to fine.</li>
    <li> The cracked heel is still a bit annoyed to me after using this. I really regret to switch to this brand.</li>
    <li> This is the best heel cream ever and I&#x27;ve tried them all! When we moved, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so am very thankful I discovered and ordered them Within just a few applications, my heels were on the way to nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this on Amazon, but found it at Costco instead, I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything out there and I was very skeptical about yet another product with broken promises, but this REALLY REALLY WORKS!

None greasy, you only need a dab too and it goes a long way.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using for years on the advice of my foot Doctor.  The only one that works for me.  It does dry out fast if you get too big of a container.</li>
    <li> I put this product all over both feet, followed by a pair of socks. Went to bed and next morning while showering I used a mild foot scrubber. Brand new, baby soft tootsies I could hardly believe how soft  they were/are. Once a week or two is all that&#x27;s needed! No gross feet &amp;#34;grater&amp;#34; needed ever, so throw those things away and try Dermal Therapy. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best heel care product I have used.  Not greasy, no mess, and fast results!  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years and it is the absolute best! This + cotton socks at night and my feet stay soft, even with Colorado dry climate.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re taking chemo with Oxil platinum this is the cream you want to keep your hands and feet from cracking and hurting!  It does tend to \\&quot;dry out\\&quot; slightly after about 4 hours and I&#x27;ve found wearing light cotton gloves keeps it moist and working great.  Don&#x27;t believe the 4 to 6 week delivery scare...got my 16 oz jar in under 3 business days!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used it for years.  I was told today by my pharmacy that it  was discontinued but might be available again in December 2014.  I certainly hope so.  It is the ONLY product that keeps my heels from cracking and being very sore.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Dermal Therapy.  You will love it if you try it.</li>
    <li> My friend from Canada recommended this product, nice, really nice can see the difference in about a week. love it</li>
    <li> My heels were in terrible shape.  Really rough and dry. I have tried other &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; heel care creams with limited success.  After only 2 nights of using Dermal Therapy Heel Care, my heels looked and felt 100% better.  Highly recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I just love it for my dry cracked heels. I need to use it every day to keep my heels soft with no cracks.  It only takes a small amount on damp feet so it last a very long time. I put socks on just after application so that it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t smear on the floor when I walk. So purchase this. You will be very surprised at how well it works.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR  EXTREMELY ROUGH, DRY,CRACKED HEELS!</li>
