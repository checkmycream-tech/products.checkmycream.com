      <li>Works great for my sensitive, tend-to-break out skin.</li>
      <li>I like this cleanser, but really, a drug store variety is just as good.</li>
      <li>I prefer that one as the formula on this page does not rinse off well, seems sticky, and has a strong chemical smell even though it is unscented.</li>
      <li>The product is just fine</li>
      <li>Also enjoy using the product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like they filled the bottle up with cvs liquid hand soap and marketed it as Vivite:</li>
      <li>Leaves face clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is WELL worth the cost!</li>
      <li>I have been using original product form vivite for 2 years by now.</li>
      <li>I can state it because I still have the original one  ad can provide with photos.</li>
      <li>Originally recommended by the aesthetician at the dermatology office.</li>
      <li>My face is clean.  </li>
      <li>clean feel,</li>
      <li>The hydrating cleanser leaves your face feeling fresh and super clean, even when wearing makeup!    </li>
      <li>Feel super clean without dryness.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist sells this, but this distributor has far better prices.</li>
      <li>Also, all vivte bottles have a very special dispenser, which you have to open in a special way upon the first use.</li>
      <li>I had good skin as a teen but between ages 40-50 have struggled with sensitive skin and breakouts.</li>
      <li>It was recommended to me by both my facialist &amp; dermitologist as I have combination skin and needed something gentle &amp; effective for daily cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, but this is my recent go to cleanser for the winter:)!</li>
      <li>That was exactly what happened to me after 3 uses.</li>
      <li>Though I sometimes alternate it with Cetaphil, I really am pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I love this facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>Anyway, kinda pricey but lasts more than 2 months of daily washing and does the job for me.</li>
      <li>I think it does help to keep my acne under control with its gentle sloughing.</li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t really replenish.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>It does not dry out your skin and leaves it feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Even though this is a cleaner, it is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Product cleans the skin very well without harshness.  </li>
      <li>Takes off eye make up really well without bothering eyes.</li>
      <li>Works so well for your skin, I&#x27;m 55 and a male and my skin is now smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt....</li>
      <li>gentle cleansing  for face</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and have much smoother skin than I should at my age- 66.  </li>
      <li>This is the same product as sold in spas for far more.  </li>
      <li>It was not any better then any other cleansers that I have used.</li>
      <li>Love their other products and give them 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It does a good job without irritating my super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It comes in a decent sized container</li>
      <li>As I get older, I appreciate a cleanser instead of soap.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Not familiar with glycolic products, but I love this cleaner.</li>
      <li>I live in Minnesota and since I began using this my skin</li>
      <li>fantastic, very hydrating, not greasy or heavy.  </li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
      <li>The original formula is light and a solid white color (not a marble frost) and one can actually feel it acting on the face.</li>
      <li>It comes in a kit, however this facial serum runs out twice as quickly as the rest of the kit, so be prepared to buy an extra tube.</li>
      <li>Also, I have been losing a large amount of weight and was starting to get \\&quot;a turkey\\&quot; neck.  </li>
      <li>It helped me feel more relaxed after a hard days work.</li>
      <li>It lacks some of the additives that irritate sensitive skin, so it works for me.</li>
      <li>VIVITE facial products have worked very well for my family.</li>
      <li>I have been having trouble with dry skin (face) after the long harsh winter and making the mistake of switching to a cheaper cleanser, so glad to have the Vivite cleanser again, my face was so much smoother and softer, no flakiness better in just several days.</li>
      <li>I am a firm believer in Vivite products but this cleanser is nothing special.  </li>
      <li>We were using another brand before switching to Vivete last year, that is just as good but had gotten too expensive for us.</li>
      <li>This price is 1/2 of what my dermatologist charges for the exact same product ... and worth every cent, if you purchase the kit you can expect it to last at least six months.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle but not very hydrating.</li>
      <li>others have active ingredients that really work.</li>
      <li>My usually dry skin feels soft.  </li>
      <li>It is half the price on Amazon.com, wow, wow.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I could see an improvement in my skin tine and texture within a week</li>
    <li> VIVITE facial products have worked very well for my family. This cleanser does an excellent job of cleaning the face and does not leave us dry. It is non-allergenic and states it is unscented. We have used the \\&quot;Daily Facial Cleanser\\&quot; from the same company, the one that does not have \\&quot;replenish hydrating\\&quot; in the title. I prefer that one as the formula on this page does not rinse off well, seems sticky, and has a strong chemical smell even though it is unscented. I do recommend Vivete products though, it is one of those items you buy in a dermatologists office but has been half the cost of others we tried. We were using another brand before switching to Vivete last year, that is just as good but had gotten too expensive for us. This product is cheaper here than it is at our dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I was having terrbile skin problems about 9 months ago.  My dermatologist reccomended this.  My face looks great, after one use! It got rid of my acne, and prevents other flareups.  I have oily/combo skin.  This hydrates my face as well as clenses it. I&#x27;m on my third bottle, and I don&#x27;t plan on changing products.</li>
    <li> This is the same product as sold in spas for far more.  Used daily you will notice smoother glowing skin.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist since I have rosacea, and it works great. It lacks some of the additives that irritate sensitive skin, so it works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser. It does a good job without irritating my super sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> i can take a shower without using this is so perfect lives my skin felling so healthy and young, i love it</li>
    <li> Vivite is the best skin care product I have ever used. It comes in a kit, however this facial serum runs out twice as quickly as the rest of the kit, so be prepared to buy an extra tube. The hydrating cleanser leaves your face feeling fresh and super clean, even when wearing makeup!    This price is 1/2 of what my dermatologist charges for the exact same product ... and worth every cent, if you purchase the kit you can expect it to last at least six months.</li>
    <li> This one is only works perfectly for my skin!</li>
    <li> My face is clean.  My usually dry skin feels soft.  All is good.</li>
    <li> Only need a very small amount for each wash, so one container lasts a long time. Originally recommended by the aesthetician at the dermatology office. Works great for my sensitive, tend-to-break out skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have used it for years!</li>
    <li> Dirt Grime makeup/ this will take it ALL OFF! Great for sensitive skin. Feel super clean without dryness. You should buy.</li>
    <li> I use this every day in shower with Clarisonic brush. Leaves face clean and smooth. I don&#x27;t see any lightening properties (does it even claim that?). I think it does help to keep my acne under control with its gentle sloughing. Anyway, kinda pricey but lasts more than 2 months of daily washing and does the job for me.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a great cleanser! It was not any better then any other cleansers that I have used. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive Skin! I use this year round and when I am in the sun too.  Love it a lot.</li>
    <li> Too bad it&#x27;s out of production!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE this product!! It is THE ONLY  product I have found that reverses sun damage, signs of aging, etc. that is not oily and causes skin irritation/breakouts. I cannot say anything bad about Murad Acne and Wrinkle Reducer! I had good skin as a teen but between ages 40-50 have struggled with sensitive skin and breakouts. This is WELL worth the cost!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the BEST face wash for any skin type!  I live in Minnesota and since I began using this my skin is soft supple and does not looked like its all dried up.  I am speaking about my Face- so it is important!</li>
    <li> Good cleanser, not overdrying.  Just didn&#x27;t really replenish.</li>
    <li> gentle cleansing  for face</li>
    <li> Product cleans the skin very well without harshness.  Very effective and exactly as advertised.  Only a tiny amount needed for each application, so the product lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I am a firm believer in Vivite products but this cleanser is nothing special.  It&#x27;s gentle but not very hydrating.</li>
    <li> Fake Vivite! I have used this product before and I know what it should be like as I have gotten it from my dermatologist in the past, and this is not it. It&#x27;s like they filled the bottle up with cvs liquid hand soap and marketed it as Vivite: it&#x27;s thick and super lathering like a heavy duty hand soap. The original formula is light and a solid white color (not a marble frost) and one can actually feel it acting on the face. This however does nothing. I want a refund and Amazon needs to take this seller down!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and have much smoother skin than I should at my age- 66.  I use it along with their serum and moisturizer.  I originally got this from a salon, but it is far less expensive on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Vivite eye cream and thought I would give this product a try.  I love it!  I have very oily skin and this product has not made my face break out or made it feel oily.  Also, I have been losing a large amount of weight and was starting to get \\&quot;a turkey\\&quot; neck.  I have been using this product and found the turkey neck has been disappearing.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. Takes off eye make up really well without bothering eyes. Check out their exfoliating face wash!</li>
    <li> Works so well for your skin, I&#x27;m 55 and a male and my skin is now smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt....</li>
    <li> bought on dr. recommendation and this is my second purchase of the same  will buy again  it is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Arrived on time</li>
    <li> fantastic, very hydrating, not greasy or heavy.  clean feel, no scent, makes the skin feel softer, even after a day at work</li>
    <li> I have been using original product form vivite for 2 years by now. What I received from Payless Beauty is not genuine VIVTE product.  I can state it because I still have the original one  ad can provide with photos. The botle I got from Payless Beauty is slightly thicker, the font type and color on the bottle is different, there is a star picture on the front of the fake bottle under &amp;#34;replenish hydrating facial cleanser&amp;#34;. Also, all vivte bottles have a very special dispenser, which you have to open in a special way upon the first use. This is not the case for the fake product. Bottom line: I got some suspicious substance for 20$ and I&#x27;m not going to put it on my face.</li>
    <li> The product is just fine but I should have listened to the reviews I have read. It was stated the pump was always bad. That was exactly what happened to me after 3 uses. I have yet to fool around with the container to take it apart so I can continue with the product.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive this cleanser seems to be a little harsh for me.  I use it once a day and alternate with a milder cleanser</li>
    <li> Good product and good price.  Best facial cleanser I have ever used.  Cleans without residue.  I will continue using this facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It was recommended to me by both my facialist &amp; dermitologist as I have combination skin and needed something gentle &amp; effective for daily cleaning.  Though I sometimes alternate it with Cetaphil, I really am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Good way to complement the skin care. It is genital and cleanses! Continues the Vivite Vibrance skin care regime. I have shared this with my friends.</li>
    <li> This is a product recommended by my dermatologist.  The product is great, the packaging not so great.  I could not get the pump to engage the open position.  I find this is not unusual for this package design.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, but this is my recent go to cleanser for the winter:)!</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble with dry skin (face) after the long harsh winter and making the mistake of switching to a cheaper cleanser, so glad to have the Vivite cleanser again, my face was so much smoother and softer, no flakiness better in just several days.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past four years and have ordered it from amazon over the last few.  Simply put Amazon is 50% cheaper than local stores!  As for the product, its the best I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I almost bought this product through my salon, glad I didn&#x27;t.  It is half the price on Amazon.com, wow, wow.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser, but really, a drug store variety is just as good. Love their other products and give them 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The others have active ingredients that really work. My dermatologist sells this, but this distributor has far better prices.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cleanser to use in between using the exfoliating cleaner. It does not dry out your skin and leaves it feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Not familiar with glycolic products, but I love this cleaner. It comes in a decent sized container and I think it will last forever. I will definetly be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Even though this is a cleaner, it is very moisturizing. As I get older, I appreciate a cleanser instead of soap.</li>
    <li> Great find!  I&#x27;m so sad they&#x27;ve discontinued this</li>
    <li> Purchased because of the saving on cost of product. Also enjoy using the product</li>
    <li> Have  this whole line,this I guess is the best product in the line, but I can&#x27;t say it is any Bette than anything I have used ,and does not feel hydrated at all</li>
    <li> my skin feels great and rejuvenated i love it. It helped me feel more relaxed after a hard days work.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this cleanser and I use it religiously.  It is great for my sensitive skin and would recommend it.</li>
