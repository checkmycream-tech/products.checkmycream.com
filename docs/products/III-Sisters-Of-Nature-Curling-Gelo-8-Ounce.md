<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>and I find that that is the best way to get your girls.</li>
      <li>This stuff is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The water quality in Arizona is arid and horrid, so this is my best defense to keep some shine and spring in my curls.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this product is great!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
      <li>They are just that darn good!</li>

      <li>This is a great hair product.  </li>

      <li>the BEST definition ever, even better than Eco styler, which I use now.</li>
      <li>Feels lights but provides a good hold.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells really good, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But if you can deal with flaking then this is a really good product.</li>
      <li>Good product if your skin can handle it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>

      <li>This product was not greasy and was not drying like most hair gels.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased with my results</li>
      <li>I love this product works well on my curly hair.</li>
      <li>beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I can wear the style for about two weeks</li>
      <li>and i love the results.</li>
      <li>But noticed it makes hair frizz a lot more</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s some product on top of the lid that I&#x27;ve been using since I got it, and that&#x27;s been more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase and happy that Amazon had it in a larger quantity.</li>
      <li>Love love love love my kinky curls are soft and curly and it smell so good...</li>
      <li>Great gel for curly and natural hair types.</li>
      <li>A true find!</li>
      <li>I would pass on this if you expect strong hold.</li>
      <li>First of all, I THOUGHT it smelled nice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried plenty of products, many of which worked well, but this one does so consistently, and that&#x27;s the difference.</li>
      <li>Okay, I first saw this at a Sally&#x27;s store when I went out of town</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s clean.</li>
      <li>My bantu knots came out looking great, they were soft,not crunchy or dry at all.</li>
      <li>but I got good results and my hair was not dry.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything special.  </li>
      <li>It smelled good and it gave my hair (especially my edges)</li>
      <li>I applied my Aphogee reconstructor, giovanni leave in and this as well as some sweet almond oil.</li>
      <li>True Garbage.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t provide hold as good as my Eco Styler (or Kinky Curly Curling Custard, either) and with the strange residue and smell</li>
      <li>Still hands down the Natural Curling Gelo is the best used alone.</li>
      <li>Yes it is just the same just more AFFORDABLE!</li>
      <li>item was delivered im a great time frame but the packaging however was terriblem when i opened the boxnone of the gelo leaked out and was a mess; some product was lost also.</li>
      <li>On a positive note, I liked the the way the product tamed my hair and enhanced my natural curl patern.</li>
      <li>thrilled to finally have something that works!</li>
      <li>This product left my hair shiny, soft, and with a great hold.</li>
      <li>Ok when u first put it on, gives natural hair a shine.</li>
      <li>I use this gel on my edges and it is a great moisturizer and substitute for the Gorilla Snot I usually use.</li>
      <li>I gave this only 4 because it initially smells great</li>
      <li>I have tried MANY products and this is the only thing that works for my 4C hair type.</li>
      <li>Unsure what I used the first time</li>
      <li>I first said I didn&#x27;t like this product</li>
      <li>in love for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rushed home, shampooed, deep conditioned and applied nothing but this.  </li>
      <li>I will gladly spend money on shipping charges for this as I can&#x27;t find it at my local stores.</li>
      <li>From literally bald to hair touching my upper back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most of the time people use hair oil or moisturizers prior to using curl enhancer gel or pudding.</li>
      <li>The overall product was just ok upon drying.  </li>
      <li>Check out the other Three Sisters of Nature products as well, they really are great cheaper alternatives to the higher natural products out there</li>
      <li>I would suggest this to anyone who wants curl definition at a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>Most gels just make her hair dry and look frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Again, thanks.</li>
      <li>her hair looks wavy or curly depending how much I crunch it.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It really locks in the curl.</li>
      <li>I really like this gel.</li>
      <li>Since I live in a place were there aren&#x27;t a lot of black people, I tried to make this product last, lol, because I just knew I couldn&#x27;t find it here.</li>
      <li>It did not dry sticky, but left my hair a tad bit crunchy, which was okay with me.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have tight strong curly hair, much like 4c.  </li>
      <li>OMG my hair is so soft and very defined.</li>
      <li>This product defined my curls awesomely, great alternative to the kinky curly product I was tired of paying for!</li>
      <li>I normally use Biotera Gel, this Curling Gel</li>
      <li>I am so happy that after many years of searching and being disappointed, I have finally found my holy grail!  </li>
      <li>When my hair dries, the coils are very soft and moisturized looking.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for you natural ladies.</li>
      <li>So sure enough I ran out and decided to use up all my other products because I didn&#x27;t want to buy this online.</li>
      <li>Stay away if you have sensitive skin!  </li>
      <li>All soft!</li>
      <li>I was completely amazed with the results!  </li>
      <li>It dries clear and your hair is shiny, soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Fortunately that smell doesn&#x27;t linger once you&#x27;ve dried your hair.  </li>
      <li>My curls are defined and soft.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love how it makes my curls pop right in and gives it a beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> Ok when u first put it on, gives natural hair a shine. But noticed it makes hair frizz a lot more</li>
    <li> This product does not play well with other products. Left white balls and took forever to dry.It was a little crunchy also.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product.  I have super thick type 4c hair.  I use it to make my hair coily. I put it on my hair while wet and I have to put it on in very small sections and twist with my fingers so my hair will coil (it takes me about an hour).  When my hair dries, the coils are very soft and moisturized looking.  At night, all I do is spray some water on my head and wrap it.  Next morning, I fluff it out and go.  Also, I get a lot of compliments!  I&#x27;m sure I can wear the style for about two weeks but I only wear it one week because I wash my hair every week.</li>
    <li> Okay, I first saw this at a Sally&#x27;s store when I went out of town and I decided to try it. I was hooked instantly. This product left my hair shiny, soft, and with a great hold. I got so many complements on my hair after I did a twist out with this. Since I live in a place were there aren&#x27;t a lot of black people, I tried to make this product last, lol, because I just knew I couldn&#x27;t find it here. So sure enough I ran out and decided to use up all my other products because I didn&#x27;t want to buy this online. Fast forward to today, I ventured out to a local beauty supply store and I saw it there. I was sooooooo happy, lol. I&#x27;m still in school and I just never found time to visit this store because it&#x27;s about 20 mins away and I just couldn&#x27;t be bothered. Anyway, this product is great!!!!!!!! Purchase it and see for yourself. Plus it&#x27;s 8.99 and as a student, I just can&#x27;t afford all these expensive natural products.  This is definitely a staple now.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;3 sisters also have a conditioning co wash. I usually shave my head every year and I experience the most growth with this in 1 year last year. From literally bald to hair touching my upper back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No shampoo, acidic conditioners. The co wash and curling gelo. I sometimes mix it with a small amount of oil (not enough to make it white in my hand though) to make the curls softer.</li>
    <li> Great gel for curly and natural hair types. Smells great. Feels lights but provides a good hold. Fast shipping. I would definitely buy products from this hair line again, as I have in the past. They are just that darn good!</li>
    <li> 3 Sisters of Nature Curling Gelo is the Truth!!! I have tried MANY products and this is the only thing that works for my 4C hair type. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s so very hard to find.</li>
    <li> I found this gel at Kroger on sale and had it for months before I actually had the courage to try it instead of my regular go to products. I use this gel on my edges and it is a great moisturizer and substitute for the Gorilla Snot I usually use. I also use this gel with my perm rod sets or when I&#x27;m blending a curly weave. I get compliments all of the time because of the definition it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I expected because I had already tried a sample. I was unable however to find it in beauty supply stores in anything except a trial packet. It&#x27;s great for curly hair. It makes your hair shiny and soft. It really locks in the curl. I am very satisfied with my purchase and happy that Amazon had it in a larger quantity.</li>
    <li> I just tried this a few days ago on my hair after washing and conditioning. I had a sample that was given to me a long time ago and finally tried it. I applied my Aphogee reconstructor, giovanni leave in and this as well as some sweet almond oil. My hair has been in bantu knots for the past few days. Today i just took one out to see how my hair looked and felt. OMG my hair is so soft and very defined. I highly recommend this product. Also it smells so nice.</li>
    <li> will not buy again...</li>
    <li> I brought this hair product in a local store. My daughter has naturally curly hair. I thought this would have been great to use on her hair. After the first application, this gelo left small white balls all over her head. I then tried to use some water and a wet brush to get it out because this was on a morning we were getting ready for school. I did not have time to wash her hair. The water made it worse. Even after I washed her hair, that stuff was still in her hair. It took forever to get it out. I paid 8 plus dollars for it and I am throwing it away. I usually try to work with some stuff I try even if I don&#x27;t really like it. This gelo or gel is beyond that. I cannot work with it. This is by far the worse hair gel I have ever used. Please do not use this product on your hair.</li>
    <li> I had a sample pack of this product and used this to bantu knot my hair and i love the results. My hair is naturally curly and thick and sucks up product like nobody&#x27;s business. My bantu knots came out looking great, they were soft,not crunchy or dry at all. Now I did use this product along with carol daughter hair balm and their sacred tiara styling cream.</li>
    <li> I was in my local beauty supply store prepared to purchase the kinky curly curling custard. Then I found some other all natural curling product that was about $15.99 and I seen a few others for $12.99 and as I continued to browse, I found this!  My goodness, when I seen compare to KCCC, I put the KCCC back and picked this one up!  I was completely amazed with the results!  Yes it is just the same just more AFFORDABLE! A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rushed home, shampooed, deep conditioned and applied nothing but this.  I just raked it in my hair with my fingers from root to tip.  A little bit goes a long way also!  My curls dried fluffy and soft with a light hold.  There was absolutely no crunch, it was all hold! All soft! All beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> This product defined my curls awesomely, great alternative to the kinky curly product I was tired of paying for! I would suggest this to anyone who wants curl definition at a reasonable price! Check out the other Three Sisters of Nature products as well, they really are great cheaper alternatives to the higher natural products out there</li>
    <li> I love this product works well on my curly hair. It did not leave it dry and brittle, u will diffinetly purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard and sticky. The next day your hair feels soft.</li>
    <li> item was delivered im a great time frame but the packaging however was terriblem when i opened the boxnone of the gelo leaked out and was a mess; some product was lost also.</li>
    <li> I have 4A hair that likes a lot of moisture and dislikes greasy/sticky products. This product smells like arts and crafts glue, and left white balls in my hair. It did absolutely nothing to moisturize, curl or slick my hair. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> An AWFUL product. I don&#x27;t like a product that leaves flakes in hair and this just what this one did. True Garbage.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! I use it for my deep curly weave and it works wonders. It enhances the curls so beautifully. And the beautiful curls lasts for days. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair. And I loveeee the smell! This product is simply amazing.</li>
    <li> I stopped relaxing my hair a few months ago and have been experimenting with curly styles and TONS of products. I have been searching for a product  that provides hold but still leaves my hair soft,shiny and bouncy for my twist outs.  III Sisters of Nature Culing Gelo does just that at a price point the makes my wallet (and my husband) very happy :-).  Please note a little goes a long way; be sure not to apply too much to avoid the dreaded white flakes.</li>
    <li> I have been searching and trying a lot of gels and cream for my curly hair.  Nothing has worked except the III Sisters in Nature.  I was so pleased with my results and I also like the price.  I love the smell of this product.  The scent fades as your hair dries.  Please do not change your formula or scent of this product.  My curls are defined and soft.  I am going to try the other products.  I am so happy that after many years of searching and being disappointed, I have finally found my holy grail!  Again, thanks.</li>
    <li> I gave this only 4 because it initially smells great but you began to notice a strange odor to it once you&#x27;ve applied it to your hair.  Fortunately that smell doesn&#x27;t linger once you&#x27;ve dried your hair.  My hair dried crunchy with the product (used a hooded hair dryer) and no frizz. I used a small drop off moisturizer to soften my curls.  This product left my curls very springy,  shiny, and no frizz. This product was not greasy and was not drying like most hair gels.</li>
    <li> This caught my eye in the grocery store, the big letters saying it was comparable to Kinky Curly Curling Custard but at a fraction of the price. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try KCCC but the price stopped me from trying it, so I cannot say if it compares. I gave this product a chance but it just does not hold up, literally. I can say this stuff has no hold at all. Firstly it has a heavy artificial candy smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me but if you have a sensitivity to fragrance, it might bother you. It&#x27;s thick but not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky. It does leave my hair feeling heavy but it did define the curls when first dried. But only after an hour the frizzies started and a few hours later my hair was a complete mess. I have 3a hair, if that helps. I would pass on this if you expect strong hold. I normally use Biotera Gel, this Curling Gel I will never use again.</li>
    <li> I first said I didn&#x27;t like this product but I have changed my mind. I used the product alone this time and it was great. Unsure what I used the first time but I got good results and my hair was not dry. I have purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Twins love it!&lt;br /&gt;Best de frizzer and hair separator around!&lt;br /&gt;A friend shared and twins thrilled to finally have something that works!</li>
    <li> I found this while in the store looking for my usual gel, Eco Styler.  I saw this and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  First of all, I THOUGHT it smelled nice.  But, that smell lingers and it got stinky to me.  But smell isn&#x27;t everything.  I must start off by saying that I am a regular gel user so I know the rules of application are to apply to very wet hair.  I did this, but when the stuff dried (in addition to the smell) it created very small white balls in my hair.  Applying water from a spray bottle didn&#x27;t help.  When I went to wash it out, my regular shampoo didn&#x27;t do the trick.  I do not use sulfates in my shampoo, but I had to break out some to get those tiny bits of residue out of my hair.  The overall product was just ok upon drying.  Nothing to write home about.  It didn&#x27;t provide hold as good as my Eco Styler (or Kinky Curly Curling Custard, either) and with the strange residue and smell combined I will not be using or purchasing again.  I don&#x27;t even want to share the product for someone else to try.  This jar goes in the garbage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say to III Sisters is to try again!</li>
    <li> Stay away if you have sensitive skin!  It smells great and works well for my hair, BUT.....when it touched my skin, it made my scalp itchy and oozy.  When I got home, and looked in the mirror there were places where the gel was directly on my skin that had scabbed over with a yellowish film.  Around the edges of my hair I was red and swollen. Good product if your skin can handle it.</li>
    <li> I really like this gel. It smelled good and it gave my hair (especially my edges) the BEST definition ever, even better than Eco styler, which I use now. Only problem is that it flakes after only a few hours. It can be fixed with water, but wetting my type 4 hair causes major shrinkage. But if you can deal with flaking then this is a really good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that works well without the flaking like gel usually do. I have very short natural hair just a little in the morning snd I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> I have a very thick course texture hair type...maybe a 4C or 4D. On a positive note, I liked the the way the product tamed my hair and enhanced my natural curl patern. It also got rid of a lot of frizz that I was experiencing. It did not dry sticky, but left my hair a tad bit crunchy, which was okay with me. The only down side to the product is that when I mixed it with a leave in conditioner, pudding or creamy product, it left small jelly like particles in my hair that were really hard to wash out. The particles were literally like little white jello particles. I have continued to use it, but I have learned not to mix this with other products. It works really good on its own. As an FYI, this is not the only product that does not mix well with other products. It seems like natural textured products mix well with like products...in other words mix gels with gels, puddings with puddings, etc.</li>
    <li> Update:8/19/14 - I tried this with their leave-In conditioner and it did a good job. Still hands down the Natural Curling Gelo is the best used alone. I took a break for a week and tried EcoGel Olive Oil and it left my hair dry and dull without any movement. Another week I tried Curly Twirls Curling Custard Styling Gel along with their LeaveIn Conditioner and once again it left my hair dull/dry. III Sisters Natural Curling Gelo is the only gel that you don&#x27;t need to add a leave in, any hair butter to prep your hair for moisture. This gel defines your hair, moisturizes and you can use it over and over again. I apply 2 a week with my wash and go. To freshen it up day 2-5 I literally just gently wet my hair and finger comb my hair. If you&#x27;re wondering why do I keep trying other gels it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t make them in a bigger size. Yes, a little goes a long way and they actually fill up to the brim so it&#x27;s not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;This is the only moisturizing hair gel that I&#x27;ve ever used. All the others who claim that they are moisturizing are false. Most of the time people use hair oil or moisturizers prior to using curl enhancer gel or pudding. III Sisters of Nature Curling Gelo not only moisturizes your hair without the need of any other product but it&#x27;s clean. It dries clear and your hair is shiny, soft and moisturized. Also, you can literally wash it off with water. A little goes a long way. I do the wash and go and I find that that is the best way to get your girls. I part my hair in parts then i finger comb it into my hair and I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;ve just Jane Carter&#x27;s product and it dries my hair and makes my hair stiff. I&#x27;ve used several other products similar and again every time I read the reviews people used either oil or hair butter. This curling gel does all. I refresh my curls by just slightly wetting my hair and finger comb and I&#x27;m good. I do that at least 3 days in a row.</li>
    <li> I have tried and spend sooo much money on Hair products for my daughter&#x27;s thick, wavy &amp;#34;Spanish&amp;#34; hair. Most gels just make her hair dry and look frizzy.  Not this! her hair looks wavy or curly depending how much I crunch it. I will gladly spend money on shipping charges for this as I can&#x27;t find it at my local stores. A true find!</li>
    <li> Love love love love my kinky curls are soft and curly and it smell so good... We have a winner guys!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had naturally curly hair since... well, forever. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of products, many of which worked well, but this one does so consistently, and that&#x27;s the difference. With how much I need to work through my hair, 8 ounces is going to last me at least eight months, if not more. There&#x27;s some product on top of the lid that I&#x27;ve been using since I got it, and that&#x27;s been more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water quality in Arizona is arid and horrid, so this is my best defense to keep some shine and spring in my curls. I used it in other states with better water quality, and the shimmer and form of my hair stayed consistent at least a day longer, which is a lot for curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slightly negative thing wasn&#x27;t even the product, but a mishap along the shipping process, something the manufacturers probably had no control over. When I opened the packaging, some of the product had spilled out due to pressure changes. It wasn&#x27;t a lot, but some still did dribble out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: if you have curly hair and need to add some long-lasting life and shine to your wild twirls of awesomeness, this product is a solid helper.</li>
    <li> I have tight strong curly hair, much like 4c.  This product holds my twist and spirals for up to three weeks!  Hard to find this product in the community. I highly recommend this for you natural ladies.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  Does not flake.  Adds shine to twist out styles.  Smooths the ends of hair well.  Smells like candy.  Helps curl last longer.</li>
    <li> Its a basuc hair gel.  Didn&#x27;t do anything special.  Does not elongate the hair as stated be the description of the product.</li>
