<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy with my order. I thought, like others may have, that these would be kind of flimsy or those cheap ones you can get at Walmart but to my surprise, they&#x27;re very durable. My order got here much quicker than I anticipated as well. (: Definitely going to buy these again.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Worked great!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I ordered these tips, and these are NOT the tips that I received... I was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> GOOD QUALITY. WELL WORTH THE WAIT. THE PORTS HAVE HAD PROBLEMS IN MY AREA. SO IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET HERE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY. WELL WORTH THE $4 BUCKS I PAID. ORGANIZED BY SIZE, LOTS OF NAILS. GONNA HAVE FUN!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, wearing these now, great price, took a while to arrive but cant beat the price, being a licensed cosmetologist im very happy with these! will order more, just wish they came in a case and not in baggies.</li>
    <li> Awesome tips nothing wrong with them</li>
    <li> Its a great price and a great amount of nails.They come with the bags numbered and organized by size which is very convenient. Must have for all nail enthusiasts :D</li>
    <li> i did receive the product but have not used it as yes as i am trying to us the set that i have now</li>
    <li> I love the clear tip, because I love to put the different colors and them and it looks GREAT! 500 nails for this price is AMAZING!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price extremely sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;And they came individually wrapped definitely would repurchase.</li>
    <li> They work pretty good. Stayed on better than others I have used as a amateur !  They do not always cut very well once glued on</li>
    <li> I Bought These A Long Time Ago And I Liked Them . 😔 Only Thing Is Take To A Long To Come . ❗️ it Took Almost 2 Mouths . i Will Buy Again But If Your Inpatient DONT GET THEM ❗️</li>
    <li> I love these.  I ordered them by accident. I&#x27;m so glad I did! They are the perfect length and super sturdy. :) Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> 500 sounds a lot but if you constantly do nails or like to practice just like me then you&#x27;re likely to soon run out of these. They were great for the price I got them at &amp; they do their part alright. Just wish the well was a little more deeper so that the nail glue doesn&#x27;t run down..it makes it difficult to apply the nail bubble free.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars cause I haven&#x27;t used them yet. I just got them today two weeks earlier then the earliest delivery date so I am very happy. They are exactly how they are pictured Crystal clear  So I finally used these and they work great I really like the fit I recommend them and will buy again</li>
    <li> These are super nice.. they came way fast like 3 weeks earlier than expected.  They are nicely made not cheap and bendy but really sturdy</li>
    <li> Me encantó!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t really good quality at all. They were flimsy and cheap looking</li>
    <li> Nails are a bit flimsy, even with acrylic added. But they work, and for the price, a good product.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Good price for the quality but none of them fit very good. I had to file them to make them work. Would&#x27;ve rather spent more. Money &amp; got better fitting tips.</li>
    <li> took a long time to get to me but worth the wait . they are so much lighter then others I&#x27;ve use and easy to work with</li>
    <li> Very good tips, go on nicely, and hold up well. I painted sparkle dust on them most of the time, which helps make the nail stronger anyways, but they never broke. Great nails for the price, will buy again!</li>
    <li> i like these nails because they are n ice and strong. the fit is great too. And they file down nicely also.</li>
    <li> These nails come in separate pouches each with a diff nail size. Its definitely a great buy. I use them for acyrlic nails and for new nail designs. I recommend to all nail lovers. :-)</li>
    <li> I like these alot they have alot so they last pretty long. Also they are sturdy so they are great for nails &amp; good for practicing</li>
    <li> they are cheap and I wasn&#x27;t even sent the correct item I ordered</li>
    <li> I read it wrong, once again these are just tips not actual fake nails... So if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for this is great for you</li>
    <li> They were easy to attach and didn&#x27;t hold on for too long, which is good for the purpose I have for them.</li>
    <li> These nails are really great. They are really super long and you have to cute them. Just be careful so you dont split them. They conform really nice to rhe shape of your finger.</li>
    <li> Theses are great nail tip for acrylic and gel nail.  Be warned guys use light pressue when blending and shaping the nail friction from filing too much make the tips weak great for colored and glitter mix powder</li>
    <li> Nails are flexible and do not break easy like some artificial nails do. I would definitely buy this item again.</li>
    <li> These nails were not the same as the picture i wanted the square looking ones and i got the round ones!  Over all they r a good product!</li>
    <li> The shipping is very quick, and unexpected since coming from Asia. I&#x27;m very impressed about that! The product is what I expected and was pleased with the item; however the nail tips are so thin, and flimsy...when I try to trim them down the tips split, and crumbles off. The product however gets 2 stars b/c I can actually make them work by using a nail drill to shape, and trim the nail which does not cause splitting or crumbling to pieces, and the shipping was very quick, less than month frm Tx....I would not recommend these nail tips to anyone that doesn&#x27;t have time to drill for shape, and filing b/c you cannot use clippers or scissors to trim. I would order from them again just not these tips.</li>
    <li> Not to happy with getting the wrong thing.. I really need the clear tips. Hope you can get ahold of me soon and tell me whats going on..</li>
    <li> They came in days before the expected date but the it wasn&#x27;t packaged I didn&#x27;t like that they were separated by little bags that kinda looked old and worn out . They were kinda hard and not as soft as other tips I&#x27;ve boughten and very thick . But It was ok for the price</li>
    <li> Love these cause they are not the soft plastic.</li>
    <li> Yes these nail tips were as expected, very good price for a lot of tips. Will def. order more when needed!</li>
    <li> Item did show up before the date they said it would, although it was along time from when I ordered it. It was exactly as described which is good because this was the second time I ordered the tips and the first time from another seller they were wrong the price is unbeatable, and the tips work well. Don&#x27;t wait until you need them to order them that takes a bit with the mail. Just keep in mind where they are traveling from.</li>
    <li> I thought I had ordered nail tips what I received were full welled tips that cover the entire nail not happy about it at all.</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t what the picture shows, their fuller tips. Which was fine with me. Are durable and longer lasting. I&#x27;m assuming tax was added in after purchase because I originally purchased saying $1.66 but was charged $2.63. All in all, good product and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> These Tips Are Durable. I Love How Greatly They Fit The Nails And Are Great When Shaping. Easy To Work With.</li>
    <li> This nails are hard to work with, when you try to trim them, they crack and tear right away, ruining the look!</li>
    <li> Alot of nail for the price, came sooner then expected.&lt;br /&gt;Clear nail tips..look great. .fit nice , can&#x27;t wait to use them.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> These ended up being a clear full nail cover not a half nail. Not like described or how it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> love the price and cant wait for the other stuff to come in l am so excited all my friend are gonna have there nails done this summer lol</li>
    <li> I originally ordered these and didn&#x27;t receive the half false like it stated. I got the full nail. However, I used them today and I do really like them. They hold really well, no glue/air bubbles and overall I am actually very pleased. I placed another order for more today!</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Some of them weren&#x27;t cut properly at the smile line, but nothing a little filing couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> got the nails n they look strong there not thin so that&#x27;s good def going to get more the price was good for 500 :)</li>
    <li> They work just as well as any other fake plastic tips to file on nails!</li>
    <li> These are very thick, not flexible for a comfortable fit. I was disappointed for how arched they are. You can use them on people with flatter nails</li>
    <li> Dont use much but ite great for solar nails but I barely use these at all so I dont need more</li>
    <li> These nails are very strong and easy to shape and file.  I love them!  They are not very long if you are into that type of style.</li>
    <li> Thanks for taking the time to make sure I received my clear french nails in a timely manner I am please at what I see, I look forward to doing business with you all again, have a wonder week God bless you all to prosper more than you could fathom or ask.</li>
    <li> Always order these and I love them.</li>
    <li> This are shown as having a somewhat rounded tip. They do not. The come to a very sharp point. From the base to the tip the sides go inward the tip is very sharp. Very thin too.</li>
    <li> I love how many nails there were in this package. They are sturdy and easily cut/buffed/shaped. Great amount for the cost!</li>
    <li> As a nail tech in training, I love to practice new techniques and show off my skills, but these nails were not as they appear in the picture. They were these hard plastic press on nail that were think and if you tried to clip or file they would Crack or break. If you plan to use these nails to make your nails longer for an acrylic or gel full set, these are not the ones to invest in. The even suck just to glue on your real nails w/nail glue because filing them or cutting them ruin a the nail. Trust me I&#x27;m saving you from opening up the package like I did and laugh and say are you serious because is a joke that they sell these nails that don&#x27;t match the picture nor is unusable.</li>
    <li> Theses are very clean with no excess on the bottom. some tips need to be shaved to make them presentable. These are easy to use. I will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Omg i love these nails,not cheap hard plastic......i like that they are sized already with the numbers on the bag ......i will order from this seller again ......oh &amp; they came early.......thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Work great and are not flimsy</li>
    <li> My nails&#x27; This is my second time ordering these. First of all my thumbs are kind of wide so perfect. Second I like the ridge that tells you were to place the acrylic nail on your bed, really good... I have try others without the ridge and they don&#x27;t even stick on with glue...</li>
    <li> I am still using these nails it has a nice natural feel to it .&lt;br /&gt; I got all 500 nails it&#x27;s a nice buy but it takes 28 days to ship not cool but good buy</li>
    <li> Not for professionals</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but they&#x27;re exactly what I wanted ^_^ very happy and look forward to doing my nails with them</li>
    <li> I am very happy I ordered these nail tips. They are awesome. The best I have used. They cradle the nail tip perfectly. The plastic is not cheaply made its great quality.  I recommend these 100%</li>
    <li> They have worked great so far. I do my own acrylic nails, so its nice to be able to get a lot at a decent price. :-)</li>
    <li> After re-reading the reviews on these tips, I&#x27;m not sure why I bought them. At least I only paid $3 for them. They aren&#x27;t what is pictured, which is what I wanted to begin with.</li>
    <li> They came faster than expected but are so thick it&#x27;s hard to keep them on! And they&#x27;re way to big and my nail beds are bigger than most people&#x27;s !</li>
    <li> I got the wrong order, it was clear ones no white tips that&#x27;s what I got...</li>
    <li> wonderful deal! Very good shipping time!</li>
    <li> They dont&#x27; look they same as they do in the picture... But they still work out for what I wanted them for. I just practice on these one I dont put them on clients</li>
    <li> i liked how i got exactly what they said i would receive, nothing different about this products description. the nails are a little thick so they dont bend much (i have flat nails so i need them to bend easier lol) but over all i liked them. 500 pieces! And they were crystal clear (: I just wish i was able to track them /: i get so bored and impatient its fun to track the packages</li>
    <li> I ordered because I did read the wonderfull reviews, but for me was a totally fiasco what I got instead are full plastic nails very ugly and I can&#x27;t even use for display!!! Very disappointed ..... Worst I can&#x27;t even return or exchange it.</li>
    <li> They were full nails and not what is shown in the photo above.  They were completely clean but not nail tips.</li>
    <li> I just cut the bottoms and filed them down a little and then glued them on as tips. I love the whole nails though. I use them to make acrylic nails in them (using the whole nails as a nail form), and prime my nails and stick the whole nail with acrylic on to my nails and let dry and then pop the whole nail off and your acrylic nails are done. Great when using color acrylic and all you have to do is file off edges.</li>
    <li> DID NOT LIKE THEM... TOOO BRITTLE BUT THEY WERE CHEAP JUST WOULDNT GET THEM AGAIN. THEY WASNT EVEN HARD PLASTIC.....</li>
    <li> When making my decision on purchasing this item, I based it on the picture and description. When I received my order it was NOT what I had ordered. I ended up getting a different type of clear nails, the full size nails that cover your entire nail bed and not the ones for the tip of the nail. I ended up keeping them because I figured I can still use them. I just have to make the extra effort to cut the nail with an acrylic nail cutter and use them that way.</li>
    <li> They are what I expected, clear,thick enough,&amp; turned out nice when i did a fullset with em all I&#x27;m missing is a case for em</li>

    <li> they came so quick in the mail ! and they are a lot better quality than i thought they were going to be. nice and strong and amazing price i will definately be getting moreas soon as i need some ! :) thanks amazon!!!</li>
    <li> the provider responsible good experience , impeccable product , I recommend it with my eyes closed , waiting for more credits to repurchase them</li>
    <li> these nails are great because you can virtually decorate them anyway you want because they are clear, you can use these to try out the different color acrylic powders. I love the length and how many nails come in the packages. They came in ten different little pouches all labeled 0-9, very cute</li>
    <li> When I purchased these nail I thought they would be very thin and fragile but I wanted clear so I took the risk but was very impressed with the durablility of the nail they are  hard and strong.</li>
    <li> Very good quality as I expected. I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Very strange and pretty</li>
    <li> Love these tip....durable and good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I had ordered this. It came sooner than I expected and I love how they have each size divided into small packages that are numbered. So that way, I&#x27;ll always remember what size I use. Will buy again when I run out :)</li>
    <li> I ordered these tips and received something completely different. They go over your whole nail Like the cheap little girl ones you buy at walmart. .</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  They&#x27;re a little bit flimsy. But i guess that doesn&#x27;t matter once the acrylic is on them.</li>
    <li> The arrived earlier then expected which was fantastic! The tips were exactly what I was looking for and they have a wide variety of sizes.  I easily found a size to fit each finger.  I will definitely be ordering more of these when I run out.</li>
    <li> The nails are a little bendy but I can work with. I purchased these nails because they were cheap &amp; I was a little doubtful but this product had me wrong. I like these nails &amp; use them on my self &amp; my clients, recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I think they are ok, I&#x27;m practicing on doing nail, and this was a great way to get a lot for a low price. They work for me, I have achieved what I set out to do.</li>
    <li> I think they were good quality and I really liked them. Plus they shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I thought these were going to be some cheap nails to play around with and try out some new ideas. I was proven wrong. Considering where they are shipped from, they showed up in a timely maner. For these reasons, I will buy from them again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> They crack to easy when cutting down to the length you want I&#x27;m not very happy with these. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> came earlier than expected and i LOVE them!!thanks</li>
    <li> Very thick. Too thick to use. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use them very much because my dog ate the bag, but they are very nice!</li>
    <li> I love these tips! such a great deal</li>
    <li> I got the wrong ones I wanted the ones that I could use acrylic &amp; I got the full nails😡😡😡😩</li>
    <li> So I would be really happy with these since the quality is good BUT my package arrived with no size 10 tips included and I need that size.</li>
    <li> I loved these !! They were strong and had a good amount of sizes. I applied them and I can bearly feel them.</li>
    <li> Very useful.....comes in nice package..all the sizes.....I recommend to buy</li>
    <li> strong and durable good quality, look good</li>
    <li> I bought these to do my friends&#x27; nails with, to practice my acrylics. THEY FEKKIN&#x27; MELTED. Utterly ridiculous. This product is NOT WORTH IT!!!!</li>
    <li> they are alright but you have to keep washing your hands to prevent the dirt from getting underneath the nails</li>
    <li> The nails are really thin and small... Now I&#x27;m not a person that splurges with my money, so the cheaper the price the more I love it, but these nails are not at all wirth the cheap price...</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and as shown. I was hoping for the box however all the tips were as shown in the bags. I would purchase again. the only reason I gave 4 stars is that I really think the bags are a hassle. however I will purchase the box separately.</li>
    <li> When I saw this it was EXACTLY what I was looking for, once I got it I was disappointed. I did not get the half nails that are shown in the picture they are full cover nails. I could have gotten the same thing at a drugstore for less...will never be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Great price for such fast shipping and product quality. Love that I don&#x27;t need to have an overall fake nail, yet can wear polish without major color differences like the white tips.</li>
    <li> I love nails, I love painting my nails, I love doing nails. I like the clear French acrylic nail tips. I think they&#x27;re a beautiful look.</li>
    <li> I would like my money back this. Is a poor nail tip I have had to reform many clients..&lt;br /&gt;loosing. Money is not the name of my game.  Very upset with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After applying tips. On several. Clients each back with easily broken nails. The pinky. Nail would always crack when cutting down to size. Not good at all. I ended up doing double work and lost lots of money and clientsn.so dissatisfied .....</li>
    <li> Not clear they are brownish</li>
    <li> Excellent Service and items.</li>
    <li> This item took almost a month to arrive, but they are worth it...</li>
    <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
    <li> These are just ok... Not super durable at all... Downright flimsy, though they do get the work done... Probably won&#x27;t be ordering these again...</li>
    <li> Are these actually for acrylic nails or are they just regular artificial nails that u glue on?? Cuz i might purchase but not to sure. U do my nails quite often and hate the pasty look on most plain nails but and i only usually do glue on never have done acrylic. And are they clear like in the picture?</li>
    <li> I love it, It was exactly what I was looking for, they came very quickly, very well assembled, and I felt even uncomfortable for being so inexpensive, that I sent good thoughts and prayers for the sellers and their families, whishing them all sort of good whishes, and I will have plenty of nails to play for a long time, I will buy more from them. Certainly. I was already choosing more items in the Amazon. Very happy indeed!</li>
    <li> I guess if your just using them for the fun of it, they are ok. But the tips are a little too thick at the base for my preference. They stick up a little when you use the glue to apply them. It makes it a little harder to smooth out not to mention, the nails are far more curved than a natural nail bed. So I had to press them on a flat hard surface to take some of the bend out.</li>
    <li> Really bummed me out when I opened the package to get the big funky tips not the french type. What am I supposed to do with these?? Not what I ordered!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these tips. Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> affordable and good product...Got the product on estimated delivery time...</li>
    <li> I like these nails but they&#x27;re not the ones in the picture. The ones I got were full white nails.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my daughter to practice with.She has not used them yet, but they came when expected and look like he pic&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product these are very nice for the price.yes I recommend this product. You won&#x27;t have to buy nail tips for a very long time</li>
    <li> This product is very poorly made.  They are not made of good quality and fall apart and break.  Save your money and buy from someone else. If you are looking for product to last maybe a day then buy it otherwise go to your local store and get strong better products like we did.</li>
    <li> french tips its the first time that i did this and did a pretty good job still need more time and make them perfect.</li>
    <li> these were not the tips i got the ones i got were full well not half well like the picture shows not happy at all!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These nails are perfect</li>
    <li> Finally received the tips today in the mail today very happy with them can&#x27;t wait to test these out</li>
    <li> Perfect amount and price. So durable, use them all the time. Great buy.</li>
    <li> These are very soft I never saw fake nails that way, but I guess they are ok for acrylic nails no problems yet. Fingers crossed. 2to 3 week wait.</li>
    <li> Pictured and description were wrong. Described as half French style. They cover half of the nail beds, not just the free edge tip. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ok so this came earlier then expected and the packageing was very secure so the would not spill any where and lose out on your nails but, i notice that either the size of the nails would be to big or to small for somebodys natuel nail at first i thought it was the size of my nail only but soon noticed that they didnt just fit like that only on my nails but you can always file them down so i would say you get your moneys worth :)</li>
    <li> I use them so much and my frineds love it too thinking about buying more thank you so much !!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great for learning or professional use with acrylic and gel products. The supply I received came packaged in small numbered individual bags by tip size 1-10. They are not too thick or thin and did not split when cut with scissors, nail clippers or nail cutter. I had no adhesion problems using 5 second nail glue. *Would definitely buy from again and recommend item*</li>
    <li> not happy at all glad it got here fast but this are not the open tips I wanted or thought I would get.</li>
    <li> I love it! They are really good quality nails and brings 10 different sizes! If you want to buy nail tips for acrylic I recommend you to buy these nails!! Thank you sooo much!</li>
    <li> bought this for my sister in law for her Christmas. I have no idea if she try it yet but will update it again whenever I have a chance.</li>
    <li> These were packaged well and came very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sure that there are as many nails as described by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also packaged individually by size making it easy to size and do your manicure right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and I think it&#x27;s great for beginners! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered clear nail tips,instead I recived white nail tips.</li>
    <li> The ones shipped to me are not clear! Disappointed to open the package and find something I didn&#x27;t want. Not to mention they cover half your nail bed.</li>
    <li> The tips came ahead of schedule which was great. They aren&#x27;t as sturdy as Terrific Tips brand you can get from Sally Beauty but they get the job done. When you glue them on your natural nail and you press firmly to secure the nail, it bends quite easily. So I&#x27;d get them to practice apply acrylic or nail art. So all in all it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT IT FITS MY NAILS EASILY AND GOOD AND FLEXABLE GREAT AND LOVING IT TWO THUMS UP.</li>
    <li> the packing is a little crappy the come in mini bags inside a giant bag. at least thought id get a case</li>
    <li> Shipped fast.  Tips are a good length and work well.  They work well with acrylic applications. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Received them early, However it was package weirdly. Was expecting a case but i got multiple ziplock bag. But i like the nails overall</li>
    <li> I love these nails never had clear before#! , they do fit all finger types!! I thought you could use these for the whole nail but it&#x27;s the tips like in nail salons!! guess I&#x27;m going to have to learn how to use acrylic loo!!!</li>
    <li> OK SO I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING THIS SAME COLOR OF NAILS SO IF I DID WANT TO DO A FRENCH TIP,I COULD!! HOWEVER THESE ARE ALL CLEAR AS HELL, LIKE SEE THRU&#x27;S, THEY WERE ARE PUT IN LIKE CLEAR BAGGIES...JUST STUPID!! I SHOP AMAZON FREQUENTLY...THESE TWO PRODUCTS INDEED ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST.</li>
    <li> Love these are so different dont have none here in st.louis</li>
    <li> These tips are so hard and don&#x27;t glue very well... I don&#x27;t like them at all.. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I like these a lot! They stick well with my nail glue and they&#x27;re already shaped nicely. And there are 500 nails! You can do 50 manicures with these! And they&#x27;re clear so you can use fun-colored acrylics without losing any of the color&#x27;s saturation. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> These tips are nice and sturdy. I would definetly buy more!</li>
    <li> Very thin, but it cuts down on filing.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong tips</li>
    <li> I love the fiberglass nail tips! they give off a natural look. And I received them early!</li>
    <li> they are ok... even tho they are a lil harder than i think they are supposed to be, but they can still being used...</li>
    <li> These nails are NOT as advertised. Not only did they take about 4 months to arrive, when they did, they were not the same style and shape as those in the picture. The nails that I received are oval on both ends, not only making it difficult to tell one end from the other, but also making it difficult to glue to the finger nail. I have managed to find a way to glue them on and use acrylic to keep them in place, but they are very difficult to use. I will not be ordering these from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Sucked won&#x27;t stay super glued</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this tips! They&#x27;re so clear - perfect to size and I just received my second set of them .. Highly reccomend .. It does take a while to recieve but definitely worth the wait. Great product!</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I needed. They are strong and do not bend or break, but they also are easy to work with. They come in individual bags (one bag per size) which makes finding the one you need that much easier. Overall I am very happy with them and will be purchasing them again when I am out.</li>
    <li> Tips look nothing like the picture they are rounded on top and bottom very upset when i recived them. Will not order them again</li>
    <li> The sizes run slightly large but they are a good quality. Easy to trim and easy to shape witch is nice.</li>
    <li> i love these tips because they&#x27;re more resistant then any other tips i&#x27;ve bought....... i will definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> they were sorted and they didnt take that long to come. i didnt have any deformed nails in my package. the only think i wish, if they would put them in a lil divided container instead of lil ziplock sacks</li>
    <li> I wanted tips, so I can do my acrylic nails at home... What I got were these thick plastic clear nails that cover the whole nail. I don&#x27;t even think these are file-able. Yeah they were cheap but seems like a waste now I just have to throw them all out.</li>
    <li> These were pretty good. The plastic is pretty thick and strong. The problem I have is that they are very curved, and because the plastic is thick, they don&#x27;t bend to your nail as well. I don&#x27;t like how curved they are also because even with a thin coat of acrylic, they make my nails look thick because of the shape.</li>
    <li> They are good for the price</li>
    <li> hasnt arrived yet after 2 months</li>
    <li> these are really bad.&lt;br /&gt;i do not recommend.</li>
