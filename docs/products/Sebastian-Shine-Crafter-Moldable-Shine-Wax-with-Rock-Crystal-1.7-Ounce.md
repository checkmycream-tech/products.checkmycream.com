<li> I have used this product for the last year and it is something I cant live without!  </li>
<li> Can use it on dry or wet hair.</li>
<li> So many other products leave my hair stiff, sticky or smelling weird.  </li>
<li> EVEN WITH WET HAIR</li>
<li> The Shine Crafter wax was not as thick and did not give you the wet look as long as Sebastian Grease.</li>
<li> but I have thick hair and am used to using above the recommendation.</li>
<li> It \\&quot;pieces\\&quot; and defines my hair, but does not weigh it down.</li>
<li> It is verly lite, and does not weigh your hair down.</li>
<li> Just a little dab on towel-dried hair and I am set for the day.  </li>
<li> Some products are too heavy or oily looking.  </li>
<li> I have really thick hair, and this just helps keep everything in place without making it look like I&#x27;m wearing a helmet.</li>
<li> Years ago I bot a Sebastian Wax Product that was very hard in the container and had to be liquidfied by rubbing it between your hands....</li>

    <li> Not like Grease Pomade which I can no longer find.  Don&#x27;t know what the product morphed into, but it isn&#x27;t this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my hair and I pray that it never gets discontinued!! The pomade I used to love became discontinued and it has taken me years to find this stuff, which has now replaced it.  I have curly hair and its great for separating the curls and eliminating the frizz.  Please keep making this Sebastian!!!</li>
    <li> pretty nice but switched over to Sebastian shine define instead</li>
    <li> EVEN WITH WET HAIR AT THE TIME YOU&#x27;LL KEEP YOU HARD TO LEAVE IT SOFT dry off AND SMELL GOOD</li>
    <li> works well, I&#x27;ve used for about 4 yrs.</li>
    <li> This wax helps keep my flyaways at bay. I use a little more than is recommended but I have thick hair and am used to using above the recommendation.</li>
    <li> Works exceptionally well</li>
    <li> I was trying to replace my trusted Sebastian Grease wax which has been discontinued. The Shine Crafter wax was not as thick and did not give you the wet look as long as Sebastian Grease.</li>

    <li> Good product..lots of shine and texture!  Would recommend this product to friends. It is verly lite, and does not weigh your hair down.</li>

    <li> Lives up to its name!</li>

    <li> I ordered this thinking it would be like the Sebastian Grease and it has the shine factor but not the hold and anti-humectant. It did not have enough hold for my short, curly hair!</li>
    <li> I have course,thick hair.  I wear it short, but it is still a lot of volume.  I need a crafter that will chunk my hair and give it a visual sense of texture.  Believe me,  I have tried a lot of products.  This moldable wax puts a sheen into my hair, makes it easy to finger-style and leave my hair still soft to the touch.  So many other products leave my hair stiff, sticky or smelling weird.  Just a little dab on towel-dried hair and I am set for the day.  GREAT!</li>
