      <li>Anyway, these are the best -- cotton wrapped in some kind of &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; outer covering, meaning they are the perfect balance of absorbent, yet not too much so that your product goes mostly into the pad and not on your face (or elsewhere).</li>
      <li>These are great as lint free pads of make-up removal / lash extension work</li>

      <li>So much better than cotton balls.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE them.</li>
      <li>I love using them as well: they don&#x27;t shift while you&#x27;re wiping your face/nails and don&#x27;t seem to absorb a ton of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it just doesn&#x27;t get any better than these.  </li>
      <li>I love these silky cotton pads.</li>
      <li>These are the best facial pads on the market.  </li>

      <li>This product DOES NOT fall apart and feels fabulous on your skin.  </li>
      <li>These are no only great with eye makeup remover and toner or lotion, but for nail polish remover...</li>
      <li>I looked and looked for a lint free cotton wipe.  </li>
      <li>They last longer, don&#x27;t shred and feel great.  </li>
      <li>are the very best little pads ever!  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to find these on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The best product there is for facial product removal, and facial cleansing.</li>
      <li>And this is a very good price, considering the DHC pads are slightly more expensive on their site, and here we get free shipping.</li>
      <li>Very gentle!</li>
      <li>i love these cotton pads, they are very soft and absorbent</li>
      <li>Love how soft this is on my skin!</li>
      <li>Cost for these on prime membership so much better than buying directly from DHC (which I used to do till I found them on Amazon!).</li>
      <li>The silky cotton pads are so soft, but also strong and absorbant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to get my husband to use toner more but his day-old beard was shredding my regular cotton pads.</li>
      <li>They are completely lint and fuzz free and do not break apart during use.</li>
      <li>I saved a few dollars for each box, and even more on shipping!  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t use too much of the product you&#x27;re trying to apply</li>
      <li>Shipping and handling is fast.</li>
      <li>They hold up very well when using a lotion or toner and are very hygienic.  </li>
      <li>SOOO gentle.</li>
      <li>those absorb way too much liquid and are so wasteful.</li>
      <li>Silky Cotton pads are soft pillows that are so much better for manicures, facial toner, eye makeup remover, etc.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I wait till there&#x27;s a sale cuz DHC&#x27;s shipping is high.</li>
      <li>I love that they do not break up and leave little pieces of lint on my eyes.</li>
      <li>I have also purchased a huge (2000 ct.) box of triple-size all-rayon puffs, but those are not well made, they unravel and they leave little bits of rayon on the face.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t go back to normal cotton pads or balls, unless quality or fibers aren&#x27;t an issue for that particular application - anywhere but my face.</li>
      <li>So far, I like this product.  </li>
      <li>Soft yet sturdy, they don&#x27;t leave lint on the skin and they do not shred, either.</li>
      <li>I used to use the Kleenix all natural cotton rounds, but they are nowhere to be found.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these for daily use when you finally get tired of those darn little cotton bits stuck to your face from allegedly wonderful all cotton pads or balls.</li>
      <li>Soft and cushioned, with a small opening on the back in which you can place your fingers for a better grip without tugging.</li>
      <li>They are a little pricey, but for me they are well worth it.  </li>
      <li>I used to order from DHC directly, years ago, but then tightened by budget and went with generic &amp;#34;cotton rounds&amp;#34; from the discount store.  </li>
      <li>These are very soft and durable - they don&#x27;t fall apart when wet -</li>

<li> These are very soft and durable - they don&#x27;t fall apart when wet -</li>
<li> Flat, but soft due to the cushion inside...</li>
<li> Since my eyes and skin is very sensitive, I had suffered from itching and foreign object stuck when I used other brand.</li>
<li> I thought I had already reviewed these DHC pads, but maybe it was for a single box.</li>
<li> You can take off ten fingers of dark nail polish with one pad.</li>
<li> Those little threads have stuck to my contact lenses and ruined countless manicures by falling into my wet nail polish.  </li>
<li> No shredding, stringing or any other sign of falling apart by this product.  </li>
<li> Silky soft, thick and fluffy, and never frays of fall apart like all the other brands.</li>
<li> Because of the outer layer, these absolutely positively never shred, I promise you!</li>
<li> the flat square or round cotton pads are not much better - still have fibers, and they&#x27;re not very &amp;#34;cushiony&amp;#34; like the cotton balls are...</li>
<li> Hands down everyone needs to get some.</li>
<li> Ordered based on other reviews and was sold!  </li>
<li> The fibers don&#x27;t come apart when they get wet like plain cotton.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t leave little shreds of cotton everywhere and hold up well.  </li>
<li> I have a skin condition and any little thing like a cotton fiber acts as an irritant.  </li>
<li> No lint left behind when using to remove eye make or appling toner.</li>
<li> I like that there is no lint left behind, no matter how vigorously you wipe.</li>
<li> These sealed ends are stiff and often scratch my face as I am using them.  </li>
<li> No more getting little flecks of cotton in your eyes.</li>
<li> I have a large stash of boxes of DHC Silky Cotton, since it&#x27;s now impossible to find cosmetic puffs that are *not* 100% cotton --</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the BEST you can buy for eye makeup removal! Guaranteed. I wait till there&#x27;s a sale cuz DHC&#x27;s shipping is high. Only cotton I&#x27;ll buy for removing my eye makeup. SOOO gentle.</li>
    <li> Best pads for cleaning my face and nail polish removing.  Ordered based on other reviews and was sold!  They got here quickly and in perfect shape.  Will order again in the future</li>
    <li> Only beauty squares I use - they have a nice &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; so that you don&#x27;t end up with shredded cotton everywhere.</li>
    <li> These are very good cotton pads! The packaging of each pack is nice and keeps everything organized. Shipping and handling is fast. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I looked and looked for a lint free cotton wipe.  I have a skin condition and any little thing like a cotton fiber acts as an irritant.  I am very pleased to report that these really are lint free!  They hold up very well when using a lotion or toner and are very hygienic.  They are a little pricey, but for me they are well worth it.  I will continue to purchase them!</li>
    <li> Best cotton pads ever! Silky soft, thick and fluffy, and never frays of fall apart like all the other brands.</li>
    <li> These are the best cosmetic pads on the market, hands down. Soft yet sturdy, they don&#x27;t leave lint on the skin and they do not shred, either.</li>
    <li> So much better than cotton balls.  I always hate the fibers that fall off cotton balls.  Those little threads have stuck to my contact lenses and ruined countless manicures by falling into my wet nail polish.  Silky Cotton pads are soft pillows that are so much better for manicures, facial toner, eye makeup remover, etc.  100% cotton.  They come in cardboard boxes.  I take them out of the box and keep them in glass jars.</li>
    <li> Nothing to be compared this product. The best thing is that it has no residue. Since my eyes and skin is very sensitive, I had suffered from itching and foreign object stuck when I used other brand. After I use this, all of those annoying things disappeared.</li>
    <li> I love these silky cotton pads. They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34;, they are substantial and do the job. No more getting little flecks of cotton in your eyes.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this product.  Their thickness, softness and size are great!!  I would definitely consider buying these again.  Price is good too.</li>
    <li> Best. Cotton. Swabs. Ever.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast service!</li>
    <li> well made pad. Doesn&#x27;t leave any bits of  cotton on face.</li>
    <li> These are the best for removing makeup. Great quality cotton pads that are soft and smooth on my skin. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> The silky cotton pads are so soft, but also strong and absorbant. The fibers don&#x27;t come apart when they get wet like plain cotton. These also have slits on one side you can stick your fingers into so you don&#x27;t have to pinch the pad.</li>
    <li> These are great as lint free pads of make-up removal / lash extension work</li>
    <li> The majority of cotton pads break apart on any form of contact making them almost worthless. These silky cotton pads are impressive in that they are still soft and silky while they never break. They never leave clumps.</li>
    <li> These are the best facial pads on the market.  I used to use the Kleenix all natural cotton rounds, but they are nowhere to be found.  I like that there is no lint left behind, no matter how vigorously you wipe.</li>
    <li> i love these cotton pads, they are very soft and absorbent so you don&#x27;t use too much of the product you&#x27;re trying to apply</li>
    <li> DHC silky cotton is literally the best cotton balls I have ever used. Hands down everyone needs to get some.</li>
    <li> These are really great, super soft and perfect addition to any skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I thought I had already reviewed these DHC pads, but maybe it was for a single box. Anyway, these are the best -- cotton wrapped in some kind of &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; outer covering, meaning they are the perfect balance of absorbent, yet not too much so that your product goes mostly into the pad and not on your face (or elsewhere). Because of the outer layer, these absolutely positively never shred, I promise you! I have a large stash of boxes of DHC Silky Cotton, since it&#x27;s now impossible to find cosmetic puffs that are *not* 100% cotton -- those absorb way too much liquid and are so wasteful. I have also purchased a huge (2000 ct.) box of triple-size all-rayon puffs, but those are not well made, they unravel and they leave little bits of rayon on the face. And I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit to you that I also bought a box of 5000 small rayon balls, equally as useless, also for toners and such on my face. Aaagh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DHC pads are 2.5 inches x 2 inches (I just measured them). As another reviewer noted, you can turn the pad over and use that, which I do quite often. Sometimes that saves having to grab a second pad when you&#x27;re applying makeup remover or toner. I highly recommend these for daily use when you finally get tired of those darn little cotton bits stuck to your face from allegedly wonderful all cotton pads or balls. And this is a very good price, considering the DHC pads are slightly more expensive on their site, and here we get free shipping. Yay for free shipping, yay for Amazon, YAY for DHC Silky Cotton!</li>
    <li> Best cotton pads in the world!</li>
    <li> BEST EVER--I MUST HAVE THESE A STAPLE FOR MY MAKE-UP&lt;br /&gt;AND FACIAL CLEANSING</li>
    <li> These are the best cotton squares and are great for any use in place of cotton balls.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and there is no better product on the market for removing nail polish, eye makeup, cleaning a wound or anything else you can think of.  No shredding, stringing or any other sign of falling apart by this product.  I LOVE them.</li>
    <li> These are the best ever!!!!  I have tried every cotton/whatever pad to remove eye makeup and would always have it fall apart in my hands.  This product DOES NOT fall apart and feels fabulous on your skin.  You may not get any because I am going to order a truck-load!</li>
    <li> No lint left behind when using to remove eye make or appling toner. A bit larger than needed but excellent product.</li>
    <li> These will be the only cotton applicators I use from now on.  Soft and cushioned, with a small opening on the back in which you can place your fingers for a better grip without tugging.</li>
    <li> These are soft and a great use for toners, eye makeup remover etc.  Very gentle! I am able to use both sides too which is great!</li>
    <li> Love how soft this is on my skin!</li>
    <li> I really really really love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love these pads.  They last longer, don&#x27;t shred and feel great.  I&#x27;ve purchased them before from DHC, but how great to buy them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> These are very soft and durable - they don&#x27;t fall apart when wet - but I don&#x27;t plan on repurchasing because of one flaw, The ends are &#x27;sealed&#x27;.  These sealed ends are stiff and often scratch my face as I am using them.  Although it feels like a paper cut, I&#x27;ve never actually drawn blood or even had a cut I can see, but it is uncomfortable, nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Perfect perfect perfect cotton pads for my sensitive eyes and taking off my makeup</li>
    <li> Cost for these on prime membership so much better than buying directly from DHC (which I used to do till I found them on Amazon!). I saved a few dollars for each box, and even more on shipping!  These are my favorite &amp;#34;cotton&amp;#34; pads.  I hate cotton balls due to all the fibers it leaves behind.  the flat square or round cotton pads are not much better - still have fibers, and they&#x27;re not very &amp;#34;cushiony&amp;#34; like the cotton balls are...so when I discovered these silky cotton pads....perfect solution.  Flat, but soft due to the cushion inside...no fibers to deal with, and the surface area of these are quite ideal for using with eye  makeup remover.  I can use one pad to remove both eyes&#x27; makeup (use both sides of the pad). I won&#x27;t go back to normal cotton pads or balls, unless quality or fibers aren&#x27;t an issue for that particular application - anywhere but my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to get my husband to use toner more but his day-old beard was shredding my regular cotton pads. These don&#x27;t shred when used on an unshaved face. I love using them as well: they don&#x27;t shift while you&#x27;re wiping your face/nails and don&#x27;t seem to absorb a ton of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it!</li>
    <li> I just found out that I can purchase these through Amazon!  I&#x27;ve used these in the past but haven&#x27;t lately - now I can again!&lt;br /&gt;They are the very best little pads ever!  They don&#x27;t leave little shreds of cotton everywhere and hold up well.  You can take off ten fingers of dark nail polish with one pad.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time for taking off eye makeup, etc. I love that they do not break up and leave little pieces of lint on my eyes.</li>
    <li> These are just about the best cotton pad ever made.  I used to order from DHC directly, years ago, but then tightened by budget and went with generic &amp;#34;cotton rounds&amp;#34; from the discount store.  I was so excited to find these on Amazon.  These are no only great with eye makeup remover and toner or lotion, but for nail polish remover...it just doesn&#x27;t get any better than these.  They are completely lint and fuzz free and do not break apart during use.</li>
    <li> These makeup removing pads are the best that I have ever used.  They do not shred when they get wet and do a wonderful job of removing your eye makeup.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best cotton pad I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> The best product there is for facial product removal, and facial cleansing.</li>
