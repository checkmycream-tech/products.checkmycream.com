<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pretty, many people have told me they love it.  Goes good with my grey hair.</li>
    <li> Really pretty and well made! You cannot beat it for the price anywhere. Between my GDaughter, my Niece&#x27;s daughter and my girlfriends GDaughter it is very well used often.</li>
    <li> It bends and breaks really easily and some of the beads fell right off. They can be super-glued back on. But what can you expect from China, right? I bought a second one and all the little jewels began falling off immediately. Will not buy any more of these things from China.</li>
    <li> Soft metal. Breaks easily.very bad quality</li>
    <li> This is HUGE, and will not be wearable.</li>
    <li> this is pretty but does not hold my hair well</li>
    <li> Larger/bulkier than I thought it would be (about 4.5&amp;#34; across). Best suited for really long, really thick hair.</li>
    <li> My friend like it and i get one too😊👍</li>
    <li> This piece is complete China junk. My wife never got to use it yet,because the clip broke in two pieces as she was trying too put it on</li>
    <li> Beautiful!! Better than expected!!!</li>
    <li> This arrived yesterday with one large rhinestone loose in the package.  When I gently took it out to look at it, another large rhinestone petal came off in my hand before I even opened the clip.  It wasn&#x27;t very expensive, but the photo was so cute.  However, it seems cheaply made....I would have paid $5 to $10 more for it and been happy about it, if only it were well made.  Will get out the Gorilla Glue and try to fix it, but the &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; looks so cheap that I will probably just put it in the box for Goodwill and never take a chance on wearing it.  I feel badly, the design was attractive.</li>
    <li> the crystals&#x27; have fallen out easily and I can&#x27;t find them could be made better</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use it... as soon as i got it i tried it on and it broke  !</li>
    <li> Got lots of complements wearing this</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> very bad quality. It broke in one day. Not worthy even one cent. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> It is pretty and well made.  It is quite large and for that reason I will only wear it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> The design is  gorgeous, obviously, but half of the flower broke the second I tried putting it on. Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t look like it broke, so I still wear it.</li>
    <li> This was gorgeous!! Unfortunately the petals of the flower where you push to open the clip broke off after using it only twice!!!</li>
    <li> This piece is my favorite one. I love the color of pink and wear it with a lot of different pink styles. Young and old ask me about this one all the time</li>
    <li> Daughter loved her &amp;#34;Love Hearts&amp;#34; almost as much as her daughters loved their hair clips. They all have thick hair and these hold and stay in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s in great position, it&#x27;s good at holding hair and it is beautiful@!</li>
    <li> This clip is incredibly flimsy and broke almost immediately. I only had it for a couple of weeks and used it twice before the clip snapped into pieces.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful, seems to hold very well and put together nicely. I will shop from them&lt;br /&gt;again. As long as you are not in a hurry to get it. To me this was worth waiting on. I am a satisfied&lt;br /&gt;customer. It is a medium weight and length clip which holds above and sides of my ponytail.</li>
    <li> The item was well made. It was a great deal for the price. It held well in my thick hair. Would buy more like these.</li>
    <li> This is georgous hair clip.  so pretty I just ordered three more to give as gifts.  And it arrived several weeks before scheduled.  thank you.  very large as all of them are.</li>
    <li> This holds my hair up really well.</li>
    <li> This clip is gorgeous, has a lot of weight, and holds my hair!  It is so pretty with all shades of pink stones, a lot of sparkle!  It was a bargain for the price, I&#x27;m just sorry I didn&#x27;t order a few more to keep for small gifts.  It&#x27;s perfect when you need a token gift, or teacher gift!  I&#x27;m going to order some to use instead of bows on my daughters Christmas gifts!  I can&#x27;t believe how pretty, and the quality of this clip, for the price!  I love it!</li>
    <li> So pretty! this pic shows nothing! mine came perfect nothing missing. there big fair warning. This one isnt as heavy as others but looks cute with a bun</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Nice accessory to wear dress up or down. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times. Must hide from my daughter.</li>
    <li> I have alot of pink tops! This matches them perfectly! Holds my hair back where I put the clip!  Very nice!</li>
    <li> These are really pretty. If you have really fine hair you have a winner. I just couldn&#x27;t find a way to keep it in my hair. This is dressy.</li>
    <li> LOOKING YOUNGER, AS A RED HAT MEMBER WE ALL&lt;br /&gt;LOVE TO WERE SPARKLE. THIS IS THE CUTES HAIR&lt;br /&gt;BRAETTE I HAVE EVER SEEN, WITH RED HAIR LOOKS&lt;br /&gt;LOVELY. IT IS A LARGE HEART, EVERYONE LOVES IT.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M 64, THATS 32 WITH 32 YRS EXPERIENCE.</li>
    <li> All the way from China....it&#x27;s a pretty piece. I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use it yet, but it&#x27;s very pretty and came relatively fast considering it came from China.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love the design and the color, it looks so elegant. cute for any hair designs .My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> perfect little hair accessory.. and so glittery... I like bling and this does the job for me.... I bought extra&#x27;s to give ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give this one a 3 only because it is beautiful to look at, but it is very heavy. My Granddaughter has waist length hair and cannot wear this without getting at headache. Due to the price and my health problems it won&#x27;t be worth returning ithttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kDaVxb2jL._SS300_.jpg</li>
    <li> Take a bit longer for shipment but it made it just in time for the wedding. Really cute and the price was right for something that most likely won&#x27;t be worn again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty small piece of hair clip. The price is good too. Relatively fast shipping if you know it&#x27;s all the way from China.</li>
    <li> I highly don&#x27;t suggest buying it.. It was missing pretty much every gem but some white ones. Flowers were not in tact. You get what you buy and have to be willing to cut your losses at some point for being so cheap.</li>
    <li> great price and great clip. it is really cute. you can&#x27;t beat the price. if i bought this at the mall it would have been 3 times more money</li>
    <li> This hairpin is absolutely beautiful.  I love to wear pretty things in my hair and this is outstanding.  love it for a romantic dinner or just to look pretty in pink.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair clip that has great detail and looks very high quality.  Great value and a beautiful addition to my hair accessories. Love it!!:-)</li>
    <li> Not happy with quality the hair clip, when I opened package one of the larger Crystal pieces had fallen off :(</li>
    <li> This is a must have hair clip.  It is really gorgeous, but can wear it every day.  It is light enough for fine hair.  Beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful, stunning hair clip I have ever seen. I use it everyday and cannot imagine how I did without it before buying. Everyone remarks about how beautiful it is. Thank You, hope you get some like this in blue also.</li>
    <li> ALSO WAITED FOR THIS DELIVERY A LONG TIME...AND ALSO WORTH THE WAIT.  BEAUTIFUL  HAIR PINS/ CLIPS,  GREAT FOR UP-DO&#x27;S AND LONG HAIR.</li>
    <li> I so love this hair clip, it&#x27;s one of my favorites, it matches with everything that color &amp; close to it, thinking of getting more</li>
    <li> This is very pretty and I have had many, many compliments on it. Everyone asks me where I purchase my clips.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and strong. Will buy another soon</li>
    <li> POOR PRODUCT............Opened product and 3 colored crystals were gone of hairpin.  Tried to put it into my hair and more crystals fell off and the clip broke. I did NOT use it rough. I had it less than 15 minutes and it was broke. I WAS VERY UPSET!</li>
    <li> this hair clip is so adorable. it&#x27;s actually surprisingly big I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be this big but I think that makes it more appealing it&#x27;s a must have for the price is unbeatable</li>
    <li> From the first time I used this beautiful hair clip, til the end of the day, I received a lot of compliments. Big and bold is what I call it. The clip itself is strong and holds a lot of my hair and is very heavy in weight. I hope to do business with these wonderful people. They really put out a great product.</li>
    <li> Be careful when buying this beauty because you must have lots of thick hair to hold it in.It looks smaller in picture but it is  pretty big but it is absolutely beautiful.lucky for me I have a friend with a head of hair like that and she&#x27;s the lucky recipient of the ones I can&#x27;t wear but you won&#x27;t find anything like these beauties locally and be ready for compliments you will receive them.I will still buy happily from this vendor anytime.</li>
    <li> rather large and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;pretty though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all good!!  Because it ships from overseas, it takes a while to get it, but it is stunning!  It seems to be of high quality and it actually stays clipped in my hair, unlike many.</li>
    <li> I love this hair pin. The picture does not do it justice. I swear you will not be disappointed. It really is beautiful. Do buy it.</li>
    <li> Clip is lovely, an excellent touch for the hair. My daughter and I both use it, she has a lot of hair so she can wear it otherwise for girls with short hair, I think it will be a little too heavy. It took a little long to arrive but I was in no rush to get it either.</li>
    <li> So pretty....  great value....</li>
    <li> Just as beautiful as the photo but it broke when I tried to put it in my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than what I thought it would be. It&#x27;s so beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered July 3rd and already here.  You can not beat the price and it is beautiful... in perfect condition.  It would cost a lot more in the USA and probably from China.  It is definitely a conversational hair accessory... thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty hair piece.  Looks nicer that the photo.  Bright and so sparkly!  Came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> The hairpin is very pretty, however, a bit cheap look.</li>
    <li> Very pretty!  It was a gift for my mother and sister</li>
    <li> I put it in my friend&#x27;s hair after just getting it and two jewels fell out of it. It is pretty though</li>
    <li> Looks better the picture.</li>
    <li> I received mine broken I couldn&#x27;t even wear it I pulled it out of the package an threw it away there&#x27;s no fixing it very disappointed it was super cute tho</li>
    <li> Love this hair clip .. it is beautiful in person. Stays in my hair just fine. I have curly hair but also straighten it sometimes and it works with both.</li>
    <li> Very nice!!! Make me feel special!</li>
    <li> my favorite! beautiful, always gets complements</li>
    <li> The pin that is suppose to go under the hair has a very bulky metal near the flowery part, which is not shown in this picture, and its very obvious why they do not show it, no one would buy this pin if they showed exactly the way it is. Going in to the trash.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grand-daughter who has long thick hair and she loved it. Finally hair jewelry for long thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is very pretty in person but the stones keep falling off. The design is such that you have to press on the flower to open and close the clip.</li>
    <li> Heavy but pretty clip.  Buy it today!</li>
    <li> Pretty large.  Not for kids.</li>
    <li> Hair clips is very pretty in person.  The only problem is that it is heavy.  If you have fine/thin hair, this pretty clip will not hold.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this. It is so beautiful and feminine. I make a fishtail side pony tail and I place this towards the end of the fishtail - beautiful!</li>
    <li> The picture does not do this justice. It is beautiful, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I just got the items and I went to  use it and I love it.</li>
    <li> Not meant for thick hair. It is cute and more ideal for a young girl.&lt;br /&gt;Or as a clip for pure decoration.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. It fits nicely in my hair and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems. I originally got this for when I go to conventions, to compliment my loli dresses. It is a very sturdy product, and works well, especially if you have thick hair. If you have thinner hair, however, you may have some problems with it.</li>
    <li> Nice for the price this clip is lighter weight then some of the others I have bought but stays in your Hair better I think it  is prettier then in the pictures lots of complements wish I had bought more I have 4 daughters they all love it great for valentines day.</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful piece, and I was very happy when it arrived.  However, when I took it out of the package to wrap (this was a Christmas gift for my sister), I decided to try it on in my own hair to see how it looks.  It broke as I pushed on the flower to clip it on my hair.  I examined it, and found that the heart part had glue on it and was stuck to the clip; needless to say, it wouldn&#x27;t open.  Very disappointed because I would have been proud to present this as a gift.</li>
    <li> This product is high quality and heavy for the size.  Fast shipping considering it&#x27;s coming from I think china.  Super cute!</li>
    <li> pretty-  had to wait quite awhile to receive but it was worth it</li>
    <li> I been waiting for 3 weeks for this item .And it brake the same day I got it ,while I was trying It .Look nice but not good qualities.I wish I could return it .</li>
    <li> This pink heart clip with flowers is beautiful. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since it&#x27;s so hard to tell from an online picture, but I absolutely love this clip. The other thing I wasn&#x27;t sure of when I first looked at it was whether or not it was a solid piece or if there was a second stick that would slide through the clip to keep it in place. Just so you know, it&#x27;s all one solid piece and opens like an alligator mouth and clamps down on the hair. I would definitely buy this clip again. It&#x27;s so pretty. Just a heads up, it does ship from China so expect a long wait time to receive it. It took me about 3 to 4 weeks before I saw it. Definitely worth the wait though.</li>
    <li> Love it so much, makes me worry whenever my girls wants to hold it, because it is so cute, I don&#x27;t want it break. Beautiful colors! Perfect for picking up my hair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received it within the expected time frame and was pleased to see it was as pretty as the picture. It stays in my thicker hair pretty well. There were a few crystals that seemed to be glued in a little sideways, but you have to look close to see that. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful piece, but it came with one of the stones broken, which I had to glue.  Wearing for my son&#x27;s wedding, so, it IS a nice piece.</li>
    <li> Just to big, items were MUCH LARGER, VERY LARGE, EXTREAMLY LARGE.I can not use any of the items from this seller. I do not have thin hair but these hair clips were heavy and BIG so they pulled my hair out wile they were falling off my head.</li>
    <li> Pretty but shipping was so slow I didn&#x27;t get to use it for my hair/ headpiece for our wedding renewal.😟</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but large.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Beautful, I was happy with this clip,  I have thick hair,  it fit perfect.</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Bit heavy for my hair but gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This is very pretty. Picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. I like the seller too, they&#x27;ve been very good to work with.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and well made hair pin, will buy again from seller.</li>
    <li> Ordered for two of my daughters on my wedding day.</li>
    <li> When I first orderd this, I also bought several other hair accessory clips and peices from other chinesse companies. I was expecting this heart piece to be one of my least fave but I was wrong. Its sooo much pretier in person. Shines well. Its an \\&quot;aligator clip\\&quot;  which is awesome and hold up in my thick kinky hair very well</li>
    <li> It is beautiful well wear it for Easter. I love it.I am so happy I bought it. Well buy more products related to that item.</li>
    <li> Awaiting return to change rating. Items arrived damaged and poorly made.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, nice sparkle, perfect for proms, weddings, formal events.  I would recommend it and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Lasted for a long time, quite durable and of course beautiful, a great piece of jewellery for a great price.</li>
    <li> My package came quick. Cute accessory for my hair.</li>
    <li> This arrived with the back clip part broken off. It&#x27;s very pretty but was unable to even enjoy wearing it.</li>
    <li> Very cute but the one and only time I wore it a piece broke off.</li>
    <li> Good product and nice gift to friends!</li>
    <li> Color on web is different than color in person.  Web is like a rose color, and in person, it is very pink!</li>
    <li> Very pretty daughter wore it to her Valentines party.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but it came broken.</li>
    <li> Clip broke. Didn&#x27;t even get to wear it</li>
    <li> one of the gems fell off,it was still in the bag so i will glue it back on</li>
    <li> Beautifully made and sturdy</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it broke easily.....</li>
    <li> This product is so unbelievable. The photo doesn&#x27;t get it the justice it deserves. This is such a beautiful piece and it is very well made. I haven&#x27;t seen this type of hair clip before, but I LOVE IT. I would recommend this product for everyone.</li>
    <li> The hair pin is beautiful but the first time I tried to put it in my hair the clip on the back broke off. The material the clip is made of seems to be a composite and not solid metal and it was very brittle and fragile. Too bad because the pin itself is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> This was not what I had expected. It came as pictured, but the quality is extremely poor. The &amp;#34;crystals&amp;#34; are colored plastic. Several of them were no longer on the hairpiece when it arrived. I had to glue them back on. The clip itself is very flimsy. When I wore it the first time, it bent. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for someone else, so I can only comment on its appearance.</li>
    <li> This is such a bad quality。it&#x27;s broken into two halves within 10 minutes when my daughter trying to take it off&lt;br /&gt;Her hair</li>
    <li> This is so pretty no words to describe it..</li>
    <li> My niece loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Very pretty.</li>
    <li> I love love love. It&#x27;s made excellent and greatly priced.  Takes awhile to get to you but absolutely worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip it stays in well. Looks super cute. Its great for casual or a dressy look.</li>
    <li> Very Pretty,not a cheap looking piece</li>
    <li> I really love this unique, quality hair clip.  I was concerned that it might look cheap, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It will go to one of my daughters who has beautiful long thick blonde hair.</li>
    <li> It is a nice piece. It is too heavy to hold your hair in place alone, you have to use it to decorate a hairstyle that is already in place.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk.  Bent while just trying to open it.  Save your money.  You get what you pay for here.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is so pretty you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Just buy it. My hair clip came on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Great value for your $$$.  Looks elegant and can be worn in a formal setting or a casual setting to give your jeans a polished look.  Holds my thick hair very well which has been a problem with a lot of clips.  So pretty!</li>
    <li> Cheap, a piece was broke when I got it, had to glue it back on, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from \\&quot;honor2008\\&quot; and my packaged arrived in about 2 1/2 weeks from the order date. The seller took extra care to wrap the hairclip in foam and tape it securely to protect it during the long transit...which is greatly appreciated...and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase from this seller again. It also came enclosed in a sealed plastic package inside the padded mailing envelope and the seller included a nice card with my item,too. The hairclip measures about 4\\&quot; across...so it is a rather larger hair accessory than I&#x27;m used to..but it is absolutely lovely, so it&#x27;s larger size really doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;ve worn it so far clipped on the side of the head holding a section of hair back &amp; underneath a loose bun at the back of the head ..and it looks great both ways! I love the gradient change of color in the stones but the entire piece is surprisingly VERY well made and also very sturdy. The pictures don&#x27;t show it.. (nor do the pics do this clip justice, because it&#x27;s MUCH more gorgeous in person!!)...but the underpiece of the Heart-Flowers section where it seperates from the clip when you pinch it to put it in your hair....has little metal \\&quot;grippers\\&quot; that help the hairclip stay firmly in place in your hair once you have it exactly as you want it and let go of the pinch-clip. I&#x27;ve had no sliding/falling issues at all with this accessory since I&#x27;ve had it, even though it has \\&quot;weight\\&quot; to it. I don&#x27;t really find it very heavy at all, but then again...my hair is medium length and very thick. Someone with hair than is rather fine and/or shorter just may have problems with the weight of this hairclip and may need to use a few bobbypins to keep it in place,so be forewarned that it definitely IS a clip that has \\&quot;heft and length\\&quot; to it.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get this...had forgotten about it...&lt;br /&gt;but...OH mY gOodNesS!!!  Nearly fell over ~ it&#x27;s so gorgeous!! And, great quality, too. Thank you!! (It&#x27;s big/bold)</li>
    <li> It took some time arrived, but the pink hair clip very pretty and easy clip-on my long hair. So, it is worth to wait.</li>
    <li> Very pretty . Pretty heavey but gorgeous !</li>
    <li> Pictures do not do this justice.  This is absolutely beautiful.  I figured it would be like something from Wal-Mart but it is definitely NOT.  This is a very well made product.  It is heavy but stays put very well.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I liked this hair pin.I hope to wear it to some special occasions,and maybe on Sundays to Church.</li>
    <li> So pretty, a little heavy but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from wearing it</li>
    <li> This hair clip is stunning, but some of the smaller stones are missing and the ones that are on there are not fully secure. If you buy this, I would recommend also buying some super glue.</li>
    <li> I purchased a few of them,they are beautifull I decide it to keep them all.They are well made at a great price..they also make a great gift!!!</li>
    <li> As soon I got this out of the bag the pieces started to fall. I couldn&#x27;t even wear it once...</li>
    <li> Thank you for your prompt service and delivery. Product was as described. It&#x27;s a very lovely piece, one I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll wear for many years to come.</li>
    <li> It took a longer time to receive (longer than the stated time). that said, I can superglue the stones back on.  It&#x27;s pretty beyond the stones falling out. It does ship a long way. It would be 5 stars except the stones were out. I have to say the seller was lovely. I didn&#x27;t pay enough for the item for them to have to send another one, imo. They were willing too, but I told them I would just superglue in the stones. The sellers are very nice.</li>
    <li> It is very pretty and the price was awesome! I think it looks better in person. Holds nicely in my hair even though it is kind of heavy. I do have thick hair though. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> very pretty and not bad price but the crystals started falling off after having it for a week.</li>
    <li> It is very pretty, that being said, it arrived with 3 jewels off and I had to glue them on which was no big deal but the first time I opened the clip it broke! I am hoping I can find something to glue on the back of it to make it work. The metal is VERY weak. Would not suggest buying unless you are crafty enough to fix it because it WILL break!</li>
    <li> This piece is very beautiful. I was very pleased when I opened the package. It is a very eloquent clip.</li>
    <li> Just received this item today. It is very big and heavy.  Take almost three weeks to deliver. overall it is nice and beautiful. Happy with this purchased.</li>
    <li> This hairpin is very heavy, if you have thick hair you can probably support it.  It took a while to get shipped, but came without a problem.  The pin is very pretty for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but all the large &amp;#34;crystals&amp;#34; fell off upon removal from the packaging. I superglued them back on so we&#x27;ll see. Maybe its just the extreme heat here in Arizona . . .</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful look and the clip is well made</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful, but after 2 weeks it broke! :(</li>
    <li> Very pretty, sturdy so far, works as it should</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and has good grip.  It works well for thick hair, not thin hair as it is too heavy</li>
    <li> I LOVE this pink bling hair clip. Holds well in my not so lot of hair and looks beautiful too</li>
    <li> this hair clip is very pretty and sparkly and I wear it quite often.  However, if you do not have long hair, I would not recommend this hair clip. Its VERY heavy, so if your hair is short or thin it will slide right off.  Other than that, I love it and it was worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for every woman/girl , REALLY a beautiful piece.</li>
    <li> Glued baubles came of after 1 wearing, so they are re-glued but should not have had to be,  but a nice accessory if you can keep it on.</li>
    <li> Its a good thing I ordered two of these because the one of them was weilded shut, and unusable. This is a very pretty barrette.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful but cheap.  Broke in a day. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> i loved the pin design but after 3 wearings, the grabber for the hair broke off.  pot metal i think.</li>
    <li> Ladies do not buy this product!  I ordered 2 of these.  Both were broken and it has been difficult to get a refund.  These are pretty, but they are not made well at all.</li>
    <li> really poor quality.....it&#x27;s was broken when i received</li>
</ol>
