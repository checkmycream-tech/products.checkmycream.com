      <li>So far I love this product!!!</li>
      <li>I have been using these products for about a year now and was delighted to find them on Amazon since the store I bought them at originally changes their selections so often that now I can&#x27;t find it.</li>
      <li>This conditioner does kill static electricity and add softness and a touch of volume to my hair.</li>

      <li>so glad I am able to find it here.....  </li>
      <li>Hair is clean, smells nice.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive scalps!</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair and scalp feel so clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s worth the greater expense.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>(most shampoos just frizz me right out) , but I do condition.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh clean smell.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner&#x27;s fresh, slightly sweet eucalyptus scent.  </li>
      <li>This is my new favorite conditioner :)</li>
      <li>This stuff makes your scalp tingle in the most pleasant way, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your locks down.</li>
      <li>Definitely full body as advertised.</li>
      <li>Package arrived quickly and wrapped well.</li>
      <li>Hope you folks are able to keep a steady supply as I will continue to order.</li>
      <li>I have tried many haircare products and I love John Frieda Root Awakening Shampoo and Condition for Dry Hair/Scalp.</li>
      <li>I guess I expected it would feel closer to a Tea Tree product and make your skull feel nice and cool</li>
      <li>Works Great with hard water.</li>
      <li>I think this John Frieda works as well or better than many of the much more expensive</li>
      <li>This John Frieda product is the only thing I&#x27;ve used that has ever been able to understand my follicular issues, even though I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>With sadness in my heart, I turned to many, many different products trying to achieve the same results....</li>
      <li>my hair are growing to fast now!</li>
      <li>I switched to this Root Awakening Restoring line for shampoo, conditioner, and two other finishing strength products by John Frieda and it is an amazing overnight difference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a total of 8 tubes (so far), so I can stock up on this amazing conditioner and (hopefully) never have to be without again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I actually bought new shampoo/conditioner without using this more than about 5 times.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a real fan of this conditioner .</li>
      <li>it was a styling type root lifter,but still really like it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a treat.</li>
      <li>and it detangles it very well.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way my hair handles after I wash with it.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>Thanks,  Sheila</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean, light and fluffy.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s thicker than other conditioners and leaves my hair more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Price is a little higher than other conditioners but it works great.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s effective for that purpose, but we like this brand for our sebaceous scalps and dandruff.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean and stays clean longer with less shampoo and the conditioner is not too greasy and leaves hair soft.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t smell the conditioner after my hair is dry, but I don&#x27;t enjoy the fragrance in the shower.</li>
      <li>Would not buy this particular type of conditioner again.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this.. a little minty.  </li>
      <li>I have very corse curly hair and this product makes my hair feel so soft and look so shiney.  </li>
      <li>Then, even with a my hair dryer on &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;, simply by turning my head upside down and running my fingers through my hair, I get amazing lift that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dry, chemical, colored, breakage or just want to restore their hair&#x27;s health :)</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and sleek!</li>
      <li>In fact, it helps to add volume at the roots and leaves you with a nice, shiny, soft head of hair sans 36 different &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;softening&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;shining&amp;#34; products (of which I have tried many, but they only made things worse!)</li>
      <li>I have african American natural hair and its hard to find a good conditioner for my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing for my girls hair.  They have mixed curly girl hair and it detangles it very well.  Love the smell of it as well.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> it is a conditioner, u wash out.i thought  it was a styling type root lifter,but still really like it</li>
    <li> I have had pretty dry hair and with lots of split ends. After using this conditioner one time my hair was softer.</li>
    <li> A year ago, I had thin, breakable hair.  I started using this product and my hair has never been thicker.  I have reordered 5 times now.  This product is excellent.</li>
    <li> I have african American natural hair and its hard to find a good conditioner for my hair. My hair is always dry and course so when i tried this i was shocked that it made my hair so soft and moistorized. I would definetly recomend this conditioner and i will be trying the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using some very expensive brands based on salon advice and they were good for awhile but my hair hasn&#x27;t been feeling very good for a while. I switched to this Root Awakening Restoring line for shampoo, conditioner, and two other finishing strength products by John Frieda and it is an amazing overnight difference. Way better then salon expensive products at a fraction of the cost! Incredible. truly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this product.  It may work for dry hair like the other reviewers claimed but it made me want to wash it out and rewash my hair for several days after I washed my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product and so does my hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for about a year now and was delighted to find them on Amazon since the store I bought them at originally changes their selections so often that now I can&#x27;t find it.

    <li> I love the smell of this.. a little minty.  I have very corse curly hair and this product makes my hair feel so soft and look so shiney.  The stores here in Austin, TX have stopped selling it for some unknown reason, so Im so glad I am able to find it here.....  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> forever addicted to this scent. so refreshing and a great way to treat yourself and make the most of precious shower time</li>
    <li> I always like the root awakening line of John Frieda, makes my hair silky and manageable.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! My son is biracial and it is the best at detangling his hair and keeping it mosturized and it smells soooo good!</li>
    <li> We use this with the shampoo and it seems to work well. We don&#x27;t have dry hair so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s effective for that purpose, but we like this brand for our sebaceous scalps and dandruff. Smells really good too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  Works great and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> wife loves it.  Makes her hair look and feel good.  Price is a little higher than other conditioners but it works great.</li>
    <li> Bad match for my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Extremely perfect for my hair ... I have a very dry hair from all of the hair coloring that I do, and this product works it&#x27;s magic. Also the distubuter was on time and on schedule great work!!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner and I don&#x27;t understand why it is not in stores. Leaves my hair feeling clean, light and fluffy. Definitely full body as advertised. Has a pleasant smell and texture; is thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner for my very fine, thin hair. This conditioner does kill static electricity and add softness and a touch of volume to my hair. It does not make my hair greasy at all. I think this John Frieda works as well or better than many of the much more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the fragrance. It sort of reminds me of a pine scent or some earthy/woodsy odor. I can&#x27;t smell the conditioner after my hair is dry, but I don&#x27;t enjoy the fragrance in the shower. It&#x27;s not enough to make me discontinue using this product, I&#x27;m just keeping my fingers crossed that maybe they will update this product with a milder fragrance.</li>
    <li> A must have for dry scalp.  I mix in a little Jojoba oil and massage the scalp.  Been using this for years, only thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> I simply love this stuff. I became a wee bit addicted, as it seemed every day was a Good Hair Day when I used it, but then I was unable to find it in any store in my area! With sadness in my heart, I turned to many, many different products trying to achieve the same results.... to no avail....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came Amazon!! Yaay!! I&#x27;ve ordered a total of 8 tubes (so far), so I can stock up on this amazing conditioner and (hopefully) never have to be without again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have weird hair. It&#x27;s thin but thick; my scalp is dry but can sometimes be oily. It&#x27;s weird. This John Frieda product is the only thing I&#x27;ve used that has ever been able to understand my follicular issues, even though I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day (most shampoos just frizz me right out) , but I do condition. This stuff makes your scalp tingle in the most pleasant way, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your locks down. In fact, it helps to add volume at the roots and leaves you with a nice, shiny, soft head of hair sans 36 different &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;softening&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;shining&amp;#34; products (of which I have tried many, but they only made things worse!). I&#x27;m so pleased that I have not only found it again, but at half the price of what I was paying when my local stores carried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super good stuff! Smells great, too. I slap it on as soon as I get in the shower, and it&#x27;s the last thing I rinse. Then, even with a my hair dryer on &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;, simply by turning my head upside down and running my fingers through my hair, I get amazing lift that lasts all day. It&#x27;s just great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh clean smell. I love how it makes my hair feel softer and healthier after every use. This is my new favorite conditioner :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my frizzy hair so silky and gorgeous! Do not use in the roots, I am convinced it makes me break out in pimples when I get it on the back of my neck/back. I use a face wash after to wash off the residue that it leaves.</li>
    <li> And works great!  Helps my hair look less naturally frizzy, and more naturally curly, which can be challenging on a muggy day in southwest Ohio.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.  It makes my hair so soft and sleek!</li>
    <li> No tingle feeling, not the same shampoo I am used too rom John Frieda.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner&#x27;s fresh, slightly sweet eucalyptus scent.  It&#x27;s a bit different from other conditioners which all seem to smell alike.  Also it&#x27;s thicker than other conditioners and leaves my hair more manageable.  I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s worth the greater expense.</li>
    <li> i already wrote long story about this john frieda line (green bottles - shampoo, conditioner, leave in cond.), look in leave-in cond.comments..&lt;br /&gt;this is perfect line, i use all together - shampoo, then conditioner, after shower i spray leave in conditioner. smell is just adorable !!! menthol and eucalyptus.. so good..! i didn&#x27;t know this smell is so relaxing for me!&lt;br /&gt;and my hair are growing to fast now! 0.55 inches in 4 weeks!!! i&#x27;m so happy.... thank you frieda!!!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I love it. I received the product on time.      Thanks,  Sheila</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive scalps!</li>
    <li> Fastest detangling conditioner ever. Shortens the time it takes me to get through 4 days of mom hair (long and curly, and after days of dealing with sick kids, would normally take half an hour to detangle), which makes it easier for me to justify the time it takes to shower. I timed it, and despite horrible mats in my hair  from not taking the time to do more than rinse off the worst of it during a week when every family member was sick, I was able to get through and get all the knots out of my hair with minimal pain in about 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a ridiculously sensitive scalp and this does not bother it. Makes my hair super slick in the shower, and very soft out.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is good to my hair. Now my hair become healthier than before</li>
    <li> Great product, made my hair feel and smell amazing!</li>
    <li> I like the product. I have thinning hair and I believe the root awakening is helping. I will keep using it. Package arrived quickly and wrapped well.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair soft but I didn&#x27;t notice any less breakage when using it. Smells great, I like it, probably won&#x27;t buy it again though.</li>
    <li> Would not buy this particular type of conditioner again. Does not condition my hair very well compared to their other brands.</li>
    <li> So far I love this product!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months and I already see a difference in my hair, before my hair was breaking and looked really dry it has been colored a lot, I also had a lot of split ends but using this has helped turned that all around. It has helped restore moisture and also helped strengthen it. I also notice that my hair has been growing a lot quicker since I&#x27;ve been using it. Usually I&#x27;ll wet my hair towel dry it a little bit and just leave the conditioner in my hair for a hour or two definitely made a big improvement in my hair I been getting compliments every time I go out. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dry, chemical, colored, breakage or just want to restore their hair&#x27;s health :)</li>
    <li> good stuff, had used before</li>
    <li> The item clearly says John Frieda Breakage Prone Root Awakening Strength Restoring Shampoo BUT I received John Frieda Root Awakening HYDRATE + NOURISH  Shampoo for Dry Scalp. I CANNOT use this for my hair because my scalp is not dry. This has happened more than once now. Unbelievable. Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> This is amazing conditioner.  It conditions without leaving residue and hair feels as silky as a ten-year-olds. I found this product by accident and now will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to use conditioner of any kind on my hair.  This product is wonderful.  My hair feels so silky, but not all gunked up and I have no flaking or itching from using it like ordinary conditioners.  I highly recommend it.  Julie G</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have very long, thick hair. I have tried many haircare products and I love John Frieda Root Awakening Shampoo and Condition for Dry Hair/Scalp. They truly help keep my hair soft and resilient without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product, but it is taking FOREVER to get to an APO!  Works Great with hard water.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is wonderful!  I highly recommend it, especially for women and men who have thin hair that breaks easily.  I love the was it feels on my hair, and I love the way it smells.  I love it!</li>
    <li> No &amp;#34;Awakening&amp;#34; feeling... I guess I expected it would feel closer to a Tea Tree product and make your skull feel nice and cool but it didn&#x27;t come close enough for me.  I actually bought new shampoo/conditioner without using this more than about 5 times.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair and scalp feel so clean. I ksometimes switch up my shampoo and conditioner and keep coming back to this shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels clean and stays clean longer with less shampoo and the conditioner is not too greasy and leaves hair soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a real fan of this conditioner .</li>
    <li> Hair is clean, smells nice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really nice on my hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel and look great. I Love the smell. Needs to come in a bigger bottle because it gets used faster than other conditioners i dont usually apply to my scalp. It&#x27;s really a treat. I used it with the highlight dark blonde shampoo. My hair is straight and thick.</li>
