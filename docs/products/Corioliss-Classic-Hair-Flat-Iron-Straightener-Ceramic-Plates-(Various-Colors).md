      <li>Corioliss makes the best hair irons!</li>
      <li>Best value for money!</li>
      <li>so finding it here for $30 was amazing!!</li>
      <li>Even if it is a knock-off, works great, so for $30, who cares?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
      <li>This a very reliable brand and an excellent investment that doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
      <li>This hair iron is perfect for straight or curls.</li>
      <li>my hair is natural curly and it does a great job!</li>
      <li>I Love it.</li>
      <li>I cancelled this item before receipt because shipping is more than a month and a review of uncertified authenticity as made by corioliss.</li>
      <li>To return this item cost more than what I paid to buy it.</li>
      <li>Best flat iron you can buy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that she is still using this flat iron.</li>
      <li>While it seemed to get very hot, it didn&#x27;t glide as smoothly through my hair as the ones I tried at the mall kiosk before ordering this one.</li>
      <li>Good product especially since I caught it on a deal.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, because they seem to stop working properly after about  2-3 years, but that could be the result of my lack of proper maintenance.</li>
      <li>and I have to clean them more than I did with FHI which was barely</li>
      <li>Temperature is accurate, meaning you can adjust it to lower/higher heat,&lt;br /&gt;the waffle weave on the outside enable a better grip, and the plates seem to cushion my hair.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more sturdier and still does what It needs to do but getting old</li>
      <li>She said it is just the right size and not too bulky.</li>
      <li>The first one lasted me years and years and actually still works but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it used to which is still fine for my daughter to use:)</li>
      <li>Functional but not as good as the black one I ordered a year ago</li>
      <li>It is pretty, and sturdy and does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
      <li>I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I will actually purchase two more to keep as backup supply.</li>
      <li>first saw this product at one of those boothes at the mall.</li>
      <li>and it gets REALLY HOT.</li>
      <li>I must say I like these flat irons more than the FHI, I can adjust the heat</li>
      <li>My hair gets straight and feels really soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>Overall a really good flat iron.</li>
      <li>but since I got a new one, I gave it to my neice (who also Loves it!!)</li>
      <li>This arrived in a legit Corioliss box, so I assume it is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>Ultimately I had to return it because the power light did not remain lit.</li>
      <li>This flat iron has temperature control and gets nice and hot and works like my older daughters $150 flat iron.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this is a genuine Corioliss, but it works fine.</li>
      <li>If this was a cheap $25 flat iron, I wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
      <li>I originally bought one at the mall, and my recent trip to europe caused it break because of our converters (bummer!)</li>
      <li>I got mine in the mail last week, shipping was super fast, took</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m gonna find one exactly like my old one</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pink !! :)</li>
      <li>Being from Puerto Rico, where the weather is really humid, this is the only one that really works for my curly hair, leaving it shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
      <li>I have had this flat iron for four years so far and have had no problems.</li>
      <li>I have long, thick, curly hair and it works fine on my hair.</li>

    <li> Functional but not as good as the black one I ordered a year ago</li>
    <li> I guess this rating depends on what you&#x27;re hoping to get. It is pretty, and sturdy and does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. But if you&#x27;re hoping for a genuine Corioliss for $30, you may be disappointed. While it seemed to get very hot, it didn&#x27;t glide as smoothly through my hair as the ones I tried at the mall kiosk before ordering this one. Ultimately I had to return it because the power light did not remain lit. It would flicker on and off randomly, so we had no way of knowing without feeling the iron, whether or not it was on and hot, or cold and off. I was disappointed, but not surprised. I think that you get what you pay for and this was probably not a genuine Corioliss.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY.  FALSE ADVERTISING.  COSTS $27 TO RETURN. IT COMES FROM OTHER COUNTRY.  NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife to replace her broken one. She said it is just the right size and not too bulky.</li>
    <li> This a very reliable brand and an excellent investment that doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I will actually purchase two more to keep as backup supply.</li>
    <li> To return this item cost more than what I paid to buy it. I will never order a product online like this again. So frustrating!</li>
    <li> I cancelled this item before receipt because shipping is more than a month and a review of uncertified authenticity as made by corioliss.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd flat iron. The first one lasted me years and years and actually still works but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it used to which is still fine for my daughter to use:) I</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron to replace one I had bought about 3 years ago (same brand).  This model is even&lt;br /&gt;better than the other one I had.  Temperature is accurate, meaning you can adjust it to lower/higher heat,&lt;br /&gt;the waffle weave on the outside enable a better grip, and the plates seem to cushion my hair.  For reference I&lt;br /&gt;am caucasian, but have thick hair with a wicked wave.  Highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Works well but not as well as the Corioliss I bought at a mall kiosk 6-7 years ago. I would still be using it but I dropped it on a tile floor and cracked my ceramic plates. Needed a flat iron in a hurry so I bought this. &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; for the money. I have very thick, naturally wavy hair and it&#x27;s always been difficult to straighten. Not sure if this is a genuine Corioliss, but it works fine.</li>
    <li> I had these flat irons ONLY for a couple of days now. I use to have the FHI G2 Technique flat irons that lasted for only 3 years and they had a really bad shortage.($120) I must say I like these flat irons more than the FHI, I can adjust the heat and it gets REALLY HOT. My hair gets straight and feels really soft and smooth. The only thing I dislike about these flat irons is the ceramic plates gets really dirty fast and I have to clean them more than I did with FHI which was barely but the plates on that was red.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African-American.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and it works fine on my hair. I have had this flat iron for four years so far and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> Good product especially since I caught it on a deal. Saw one in the mall that was $200 and this compares to it!</li>

    <li> This is the third Corioliss I&#x27;m buying for my daughters&#x27; curly hair. Best value for money!</li>
    <li> This flat iron has temperature control and gets nice and hot and works like my older daughters $150 flat iron. I had one for 3 years and just bought another one.</li>
    <li> This hair iron is perfect for straight or curls. Adjustable heat settings. It&#x27;s amazing!  Corioliss makes the best hair irons! I had one before (red leopard print w/out heat adjustment) for 6 or 7 years! It still works likes a champ but since I got a new one, I gave it to my neice (who also Loves it!!)</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail last week, shipping was super fast, took only 3 days after i ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;I first saw this product at one of those boothes at the mall. I instantly fell in love with it. My hair is very thick and my curls are very tight, but it was no challenge for this straightner. The only thing that ruined it for me was the price. I dont have $200 to blow on a straightner so finding it here for $30 was amazing!!</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected..I had bought one long time ago like 7 yrs it&#x27;s more sturdier and still does what It needs to do but getting old and I thought this one would be the same,not quite. &#x3D;( I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m gonna find one exactly like my old one But it will do for now..</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Farouk Micro Chi Straightener. DO NOT buy one of those. I Love it. my hair is natural curly and it does a great job! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this flat iron. How can you not ? It&#x27;s pink !! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I bought this November, 2013 and it no longer works. If this was a cheap $25 flat iron, I wouldn&#x27;t care. But, I do expect it to last for at least a year at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this while traveling in the U.S., Australia, and Europe. It worked well overseas.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter two years ago and she loves it.  Her hair is down to her waist.  I had bought her a Chi that was more expensive and didn&#x27;t last at all.  I&#x27;m happy to say that she is still using this flat iron.</li>
