      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>Love these...</li>
      <li>Love them.  </li>
      <li>zag part and used the combs to pull up the sides of my hair to add more volume to the top of my head.</li>
      <li>I did love the style and</li>
      <li>Love those!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
      <li>These are my favorite hairclips but they break easy.</li>
      <li>Breaks to easy</li>
      <li>If you have curly hair like me it shows all the beautiful big curls, but keeps them away from my face.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine textured curly hair.</li>
      <li>I love them, they were exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I would love to get one made with higher quality materials.</li>
      <li>I like the looser fit of the comb, but most of my hair ends up outside the comb after an hour because it is too easy for my hair to fall out of the extension below the two combs.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell you how long I have been looking for this item, I am very pleased with products and price.</li>
      <li>Worth the money to try it.</li>
      <li>but I like it very much</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy more if I could save on shipping.</li>
      <li>is perfect for pulling your hair back but leaving a long flow in the back versus a pony tail.</li>
      <li>This holds your hair similar to the 80&#x27;s banana clip - but way better - doesn&#x27;t feel like its pulling your hair like those old contraptions (I still have some and have used them on occasion).</li>
      <li>Old school but affective!!!</li>
      <li>Need more Dark colors.</li>
      <li>If you have hair like I do, I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>I love these little things!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This works in my hair as long as I don&#x27;t move my head quickly, otherwise it falls out.  </li>
      <li>This was just what I was looking for from the early 80&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>Works especially well when you curl your hair first.</li>
      <li>my hair is naturally wavy curls.</li>
      <li>This does not work well with 4C natural hair.</li>
      <li>For you young ladies - google banana clip and you will see the difference between this and the old</li>
      <li>I bought several many years ago and I am down to the last one which is about to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(My regular banana clips have lasted for a decade, but the new ones I bought also broke immediately, so I assume it&#x27;s the type of plastics now used.)</li>
      <li>I love this item and they are so hard to find!</li>
      <li>This comb will hold all your hair if it is very long and very curly.</li>
      <li>I love how this especially makes my hair look in the back which i usually don&#x27;t bother even looking.</li>

<li> /&gt;These are the only things that will hold my naturally curly, thick hair.</li>
<li> Holds my hair loosely.  </li>
<li> Just as I had expected.</li>
<li> I have had to use a nail file to file down some rough spots</li>
<li> , the comb teeth are a little close together, thats why it got a four, but other than that ...</li>
<li> My hair is extremely thick and curly.</li>
<li> Too expensive, you can buy a brown one for half the price.</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>

    <li> I like the looser fit of the comb, but most of my hair ends up outside the comb after an hour because it is too easy for my hair to fall out of the extension below the two combs. Maybe my shoulder length hair is too short for this type of comb.</li>

    <li> This broke the second time I wore it. I did love the style and how it made my hair look. I would love to get one made with higher quality materials.
