      <li>I really think these exfoliating washcloth&#x27;s are wonderful they are just the right size, and love how you can put your soap or what ever you are using in the middle pocket and really get a good soap up.</li>

      <li>This is so fantastic.</li>
      <li>and I have never felt so clean.</li>
      <li>I have one for my face and another for my body because I use special soaps on my face and with these you just throw in the washer and reuse.</li>
      <li>i tried to use like a washcloth balls up and hard to use the best way i found to use them is put soap inside the pouch.</li>
      <li>i love this for my feet, but not my face, because feels like can take my skin off, i tried once on my skin anyway, its just too much for my skin.</li>
      <li>Cheap product for too much money if you ask me.</li>
      <li>the picture with the hand by the face they show is a laugh maybe a toddlers hand.</li>
      <li>was one of my first steps in doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just used it for the first time</li>
      <li>The skin on my face is really soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>and I felt clean and gained soft supple skin as a result.  </li>
      <li>Also, compared to others I have tried, I feel that I have to put a little more pressure in order to feel clean.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re like little mits that fit over the tips of your fingers which makes them easy to use.</li>
      <li>(Well, I did, on certain parts of my body, but that&#x27;s just b/c</li>
      <li>Very goog for exfoliating.</li>
      <li>Very affordable, enduring, sanitary.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really nice to use and get the dead skin off, then toss the cloth into the wash and reuse it.  </li>
      <li>It has a very coarse texture, though I do not find it uncomfortable, it kind of feels like lightly scratching, which I actually think feels nice.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who would like a long lasting product that can be re used and actually does the trick better than any scrubby in the store !!</li>
      <li>As I have gotten older, I have noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Still at that just a little bigger would still be nice they do shrink when the hot shower hits them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>The do feel a little scratchy, for lack of a better word.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using my regular face wash with the cloth and going in a circular motion, very gently and for about two minutes.</li>
      <li>My skin always feels soooo soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>They leave your skin feeling soft and rejuvenated.</li>
      <li>I was actually surprised by this product, it is scratchier than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
      <li>save my a lots time to clean my feet&#x27;s dead skin.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this Exfoliating Cloth to all for removing all the dead skin and making your skin look and feel clean and younger.</li>
      <li>Very fine thin pockets to put soap in</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it would be much different than a regular wash cloth.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re pretty thin and a bit small to fit your whole hand, but it&#x27;ll easily go up to your thumb if you intend to use it like a mitt; I like to just toss the soap bar in the pouch and lather up like usual.</li>
      <li>The towels are abrasive enough to exfoliate, but not enough to irritate (then again, I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>If they would make them a little bigger to accommodate a normal female adult hand would rate higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I was tired of buying the scrubbies from the market.  This exfoliating washcloth towel is reusable and will last me for awhile.  No more scrubbies falling apart in my shower and I felt clean and gained soft supple skin as a result.  Gave me a glow I have been missing for a long time.  I would recommend this product to anyone who would like a long lasting product that can be re used and actually does the trick better than any scrubby in the store !!</li>
    <li> i love this for my feet, but not my face, because feels like can take my skin off, i tried once on my skin anyway, its just too much for my skin. but for feet, it is perfect! save my a lots time to clean my feet&#x27;s dead skin.</li>
    <li> The quality is just not there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited that I got these Exfoliating Washcloths !  As I have gotten older, I have noticed a difference in my skin.  I never use to wash my face at the end of the day.  But now, I am starting to change my skin care regimen and using these washcloths was one of my first steps in doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them kind of like a glove, slipped my hands inside them.  I really didn&#x27;t think it would be much different than a regular wash cloth.  i was sooo wrong!  These really felt as though I am getting the dead skin off my face and it is rejuvenating my skin as I wash.  The do feel a little scratchy, for lack of a better word.  But that feature is what makes them so great for a skin care regimen!  After using these, I apply a good moisturizer.  I haven&#x27;t been using them long enough to see long term results, but I am looking forward to that.  I do however, know that my face feels better after having used them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 4 in a package, and I have saved one out, exclusively to use on my feet.  When iI used them on my feet, I noticed a TON of skin came off!  I can&#x27;t believe how much better my feet felt after just a couple times!  These are a must have for any household!! I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review  and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates OK not too rough to be uncomfortable. I was not given these as a review so i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the difference with my review I found them to be small the picture with the hand by the face they show is a laugh maybe a toddlers hand. The water hits them they shrink more and i pull them back out after shower. i tried to use like a washcloth balls up and hard to use the best way i found to use them is put soap inside the pouch. If they would make them a little bigger to accommodate a normal female adult hand would rate higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going to put the package with the other 2 up i noticed they were bigger than the 2 i had already took out maybe just defective package of them i got. Still at that just a little bigger would still be nice they do shrink when the hot shower hits them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the size variation in my package they are just too small</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be of good quality.  Very fine thin pockets to put soap in</li>
    <li> good for a real scrubbing. just a little bit small for adult hands.</li>
    <li> These Exfoliating Cloths are great! I&#x27;ve been using these for about a week and I&#x27;ve seen a big improvement in my skin. The skin on my face is really soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using my regular face wash with the cloth and going in a circular motion, very gently and for about two minutes. They&#x27;re like little mits that fit over the tips of your fingers which makes them easy to use. I&#x27;ve been doing this every morning and I notice that my make up is going on more smoothly after using these too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my arms and legs. I&#x27;ve been seeing less ingrown hairs on my legs, which is great! I just have to make sure to put lotion on after to make sure everything stays moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for fair review.</li>
    <li> Exfoliating Washcloth Towels pretty amazing product. I&#x27;m glad I was giving it for testing and reviewing. Where has this been all my showering life! This is so fantastic. I just used it for the first time and I have never felt so clean. I feel exfoliated all over my body, and I didn&#x27;t even have to use any fancy exfoliating scrub! (Well, I did, on certain parts of my body, but that&#x27;s just b/c I love fancy scrubs, but I&#x27;m confident this product works just as well without it). Just a squirt of a regular shower gel onto the cloth, lather it up, and scrub away. I was actually surprised by this product, it is scratchier than I thought it&#x27;d be. It has a very coarse texture, though I do not find it uncomfortable, it kind of feels like lightly scratching, which I actually think feels nice. Using this awesome towel makes my skin super soft, softer than it has ever been. It is easy to use, clean, and maintain. Very affordable, enduring, sanitary. Prolongs the life of soaps, shower gels, face washes.</li>
    <li> These are okay, however, not the best. They a little too small for putting my hand in.  Also, compared to others I have tried, I feel that I have to put a little more pressure in order to feel clean.</li>
    <li> the wash cloths were very small</li>
    <li> It washed your skin well but you need allot of finger dexterity to keep it on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;It should of been made a little longer too help keep it on your hand. It stretches but that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;not enough to not struggle to keep it on your hand. I guess if you need exercise for finger&lt;br /&gt;dexterity it&#x27;t a great workout.</li>
    <li> These Asian Magic Exfoliating Cloths are wonderful. They leave your skin feeling soft and rejuvenated. It is so easy to use them I just use my favorite shower gel and lather it up and wash. The cloths hold a great lather and do the exfoliating for you as you wash. I have one for my face and another for my body because I use special soaps on my face and with these you just throw in the washer and reuse. They are well made and hold up to washing n drying. They are not rough like a shower gel sponge and feel great when you use them. I am so glad I decided to test these for quality because they are the best I&#x27;ve found. I would highly recommend this Exfoliating Cloth to all for removing all the dead skin and making your skin look and feel clean and younger.</li>
    <li> I really think these exfoliating washcloth&#x27;s are wonderful they are just the right size, and love how you can put your soap or what ever you are using in the middle pocket and really get a good soap up. I even tried just water on the towel and even then that help with getting any dry skin that I had on my face off. I received this item in exchange for an honest review</li>
    <li> Very goog for exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Too small. And I have small hands. Do not bother to buy these clothes. Cheap product for too much money if you ask me. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> These were so small that they don&#x27;t even cover a bar of soap. And they SMELL AWFUL.</li>
    <li> These are great.

    <li> A good cloth to have for exfoliating your face and body.  It&#x27;s rough, but not too rough.  It&#x27;s really nice to use and get the dead skin off, then toss the cloth into the wash and reuse it.  I also like the different colors available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
