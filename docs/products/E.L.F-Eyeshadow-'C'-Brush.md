      <li>I like this brush better than my real techniques eye shadow brush.</li>

      <li>This brush applies eyeshadow very nicely and heavily.</li>

      <li>I will definitely be buying more of E.L.F brushes instead of spending on similar quality ones for more money.</li>
      <li>I like that it can easily be used to apply different colors, since the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t really stick to it.  </li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>The fibers are sturdy and apply very well.</li>
      <li>It really does the job of applying eye shadows.</li>
      <li>Eye shadow goes on very well and evenly.</li>
      <li>I really like this brush.</li>
      <li>I needed an eyeshadow brush and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to buy a whole set.  </li>
      <li>I really like this brush.</li>
      <li>I like the handle and the label because the label on my real techniques brush rubbed off already.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The bristles stay put, easy to clean, just the right balance of firm and soft.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are densely packed and stiff enough to pick up eyeshadow well, and it&#x27;s great for blending too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very soft and seems pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft against your skin but dense &amp; firm enough to let you smudge your shadows beautifully.</li>
      <li>I needed a nice soft brush for my eyeshadow and did not want to pay Bare Essential prices</li>
      <li>This brush is $3.00 at Target &amp; on ELF&#x27;s website, so why is it so high here?</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to get other colors off to re-use for another color.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not to hard, but not to soft, it spreads my eye shadow nicely.</li>
      <li>the brush is dense and soft but the handle and metal part is cheap as expected.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very soft too.  </li>
      <li>I lost my first one, and this is my second time purchasing one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to using regular foam applicators to apply eyeshadow, so this was tricky for me to use at first.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using the wrong kind of eyeshadow with this brush, but it doesn&#x27;t transfer any of the eyeshadow from the palette onto my eyelid!</li>
      <li>Very accurate where you need it and handles dry or wet.</li>
      <li>You have to apply the eyeshadow carefully with precise short strokes, otherwise it will come off the brush and end up on your face rather than on your eyelid.  </li>
      <li>It does not shed and it&#x27;s soft.</li>
      <li>and the bristles have remained in place---so far, none of them have fallen off.  </li>
      <li>This brush is so soft and dense that it packs on color effortlessly.</li>
      <li>it applies a base color to the lid easily and pretty precisely and packs on color decently.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve washed it multiple times and it&#x27;s just like new.</li>
      <li>I love this brush, but I am a very small person, and I find it hard to make sure that I keep this just on my eyelids without it wandering a little.  </li>
      <li>I love this brush because one side of the brush is flat, and the other side is slightly round.</li>
      <li>Really holds the powder well and places powder without making a mess.</li>

    <li> Absolutely fabulous brush! Really holds the powder well and places powder without making a mess.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow brush is just what I needed.  So soft, yet holds it shape for perfect blending purposes.  Great price as well.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. Can be used for concealer, eyeshadow, shading, blending, anything. It even holds up well after cleaned.</li>
    <li> A very good quality brush, especially considering the price. The bristles are densely packed and stiff enough to pick up eyeshadow well, and it&#x27;s great for blending too. It&#x27;s also very soft and seems pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it picks up  color very well, so I usually only use it to place my transition or base color.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent! The fibers are sturdy and apply very well. The handle is easy to grip and handle. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> dont know what to say about this brush, it does what it says, nice, reasonably priced. it is a bit bulky.</li>
    <li> Well made brush. Eye shadow goes on very well and evenly.</li>
    <li> I use this for applying/packing on all over lid color. it applies a base color to the lid easily and pretty precisely and packs on color decently. the brush is dense and soft but the handle and metal part is cheap as expected.</li>
    <li> This brush is $3.00 at Target &amp; on ELF&#x27;s website, so why is it so high here? In fact, the s/h was $2.50, bringing my total less than the price of one brush on Amazon. All I can say is make sure you research your product, at the vendor&#x27;s site thoroughly before purchasing, it could save you a couple of dollars.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, it&#x27;s not to hard, but not to soft, it spreads my eye shadow nicely. It feels sturdy, like I paid a lot more! But didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I needed an eyeshadow brush and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to buy a whole set.  This was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  Great for blending eye shadow!  I would definitely buy this brush again!  A very good brush</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft and perfect for eye shadow. I use it with elf palettes and other brands, too.</li>
    <li> This brush is a little stiffer than the brush I prefer for my concealer. This makes it perfect for eye shadow.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It does pick up a lot of color (which coupled with my heavy hand can be dangerous), so I use it to blend rather than apply. I&#x27;ve had the brush since June of 2013 and while I usually wash my eyeshadow brushes less frequently than my base make-up, blush, and bronzer brushes, which I do every other week, I have not experienced much bristle shedding.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Takes and distributes color nicely as well as mixing them if desired.  Washes easily and has survived lots of traveling.  Love it - is a must-have for make-up application.</li>
    <li> It could be a bit more thinner but that&#x27;s my taste.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
    <li> This brush applies eyeshadow very nicely and heavily.</li>
    <li> Bristles are firmly attached, but soft and fluffy enough for blending. A good value, and a tool I use daily.</li>
    <li> I really started loving elf products after seeing a tutorial for makeup on youtube using them. It got really good reviews so I purchased it. It works great! Especially when blending in different eyeshadows. Love the elf line of brushes. I lost my first one, and this is my second time purchasing one. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy bristles no complaints. I use it for eyeshadow or contour my nose. Can&#x27;t wait to get the rest of my brushes.</li>
    <li> It works really well. The bristles stay in and it applies makeup smoothly. I would definitely recommend. Excellently low price.</li>
    <li> Great brush and amazing price (as usual with elf products)! Works great for applying eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using the wrong kind of eyeshadow with this brush, but it doesn&#x27;t transfer any of the eyeshadow from the palette onto my eyelid! It&#x27;s pretty useless for me :(</li>
    <li> I received this brush in a eye shadow set as a birthday gift. I&#x27;m not hype about e.l.f eye shadows because the pigmentation are not good and the wear does not last long. I don&#x27;t recommend e.l.f eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;I like this brush because it works well. It really does the job of applying eye shadows. It does not shed and it&#x27;s soft. Unfortunately it did not last long. My brush unglued itself after a good wash routine. It lasted over a year. I want to say that I will buy this brush but...I want to try other brushes out there.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft and dense that it packs on color effortlessly. I guess you could even do some blending with it given how dense it is. I absolutely love this! I&#x27;ve washed it multiple times and it&#x27;s just like new. Feels like a much more expensive brush to me.</li>
    <li> Great brush at twice the price. Very accurate where you need it and handles dry or wet. I use this every day.</li>
    <li> great brush for the price</li>
    <li> I love this brush because one side of the brush is flat, and the other side is slightly round. I use lighter color on the flat side and darker color on the round side. I use the tip of the brush to blend the two. It works great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to get other colors off to re-use for another color. It&#x27;s a soft brush and puts on eyeshadow beautifully. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> I particularly love blending with this brush.  I have two - on one, the head falls off once in a while (I just shove it back on), but on the other, no problems.  The bristles stay put, easy to clean, just the right balance of firm and soft.  And, a great blender.</li>
    <li> I like this brush better than my real techniques eye shadow brush. It&#x27;s easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t shed. it&#x27;s very soft too.  I like the handle and the label because the label on my real techniques brush rubbed off already.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had problems creating the perfect smokey eye, THIS brush will solve them! I thought it was just me being a klutz, but since this brush arrived, my smokey eye look comes out perfect every time. It&#x27;s soft against your skin but dense &amp; firm enough to let you smudge your shadows beautifully. And you can&#x27;t beat the price on any E.L.F. brush. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, but I am a very small person, and I find it hard to make sure that I keep this just on my eyelids without it wandering a little.  If I was a normal sized I think this brush would be absolutely perfect :)</li>
    <li> i was so excited my product had been delivered, when i opened it it was a totally different brush.. they sent me a &amp;#34;powder brush&amp;#34; instead of the one i had ordered! so dissapointed! :/</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t a smudge brush because its too thick, If you wanted a brush for eyeshadow you should pick up a blending brush. This brush is oddly thick, doesn&#x27;t blend well at all. Just avoid this do nothing brush.</li>
    <li> this brush is okay but the end of the brush is really small and its hard to put on eyeshadow with.</li>
    <li> Really like this brush!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It works great and none of the bristles have fallen out so far. would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  It&#x27;s perfect for all over lid color and I also use it to highlight the brow.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using regular foam applicators to apply eyeshadow, so this was tricky for me to use at first.  You have to apply the eyeshadow carefully with precise short strokes, otherwise it will come off the brush and end up on your face rather than on your eyelid.  Also, the eyeshadow has to be applied in layers.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, and the brush has held up well and the bristles have remained in place---so far, none of them have fallen off.  The bristles are soft, but densely packed, and the handle is a good length.  I like that it can easily be used to apply different colors, since the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t really stick to it.  However, it doesn&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow as easily as a foam applicator, so application time is longer.  I don&#x27;t know if I would buy another brush when this one needs to be replaced.  I may go back to foam applicators.</li>
    <li> Great brush!!  I needed a nice soft brush for my eyeshadow and did not want to pay Bare Essential prices so I bought this one on a whim and it ended up being great!!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The absolute best eye shadow brush!The bristles are soft and tightly compacted for optimal application. I will definitely be buying more of E.L.F brushes instead of spending on similar quality ones for more money. Worth the Money!</li>
