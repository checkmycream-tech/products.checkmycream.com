### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Shaver is real good.</li>
      <li>Not the best one to keep in your car for 5 o&#x27;clock shadow or for travelling in the Amazon jungle with no power outlets in sight.</li>
      <li>the charge indicator is excellent.</li>
      <li>This is not the best electric razor in the world, but gives a nice shave for the value!  </li>
      <li>Aside from a great shave, there is no razor pull or burn and no break-in period with the Titanium head.</li>
      <li>While I was impressed with the quality and the close shave I found that the battery lost its charge very quickly even when it was not being used.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good value for the money.</li>
      <li>For 50 bucks, it was a good deal too.  </li>
      <li>This razor works great nice and close no follow-up with a straigth edge</li>
      <li>The item is good and met my expectations.</li>
      <li>It is Good.</li>
      <li>Good value for money.</li>
      <li>Great clean shave.</li>
      <li>A good shaver, comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>thing I noticed is on a FULL charge, if you use the shaver right after unplugging it from the wall, it works AWESOME.  </li>
      <li>I experienced a lot of cuts at first.</li>
      <li>Shaving closeness-pretty good for the first year, when the sidburn shaver stopped working, and I replaced it with a Braun Syncho 7526!</li>
      <li>It shaves adequately, nothing exceptional, but you better keep it plugged in.  </li>
      <li>Electric is never as close as a blade, but this is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>It does have a 2 year warranty, so I would make sure I kept my receipt.</li>
      <li>It was just ok.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t shave cordless for more than 10 secs.</li>
      <li>, I was hoping this might be better.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it is a GREAT razor!  </li>
      <li>It is easy to clean and maintain</li>
      <li>which is not an unusual one.. overall an excellent product.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>It still shaves fine with the original set of rotating blades.</li>
      <li>razor is good enough for years of use.</li>
      <li>It is not quite the same quality as the Norelco, but for the difference in price it is definetly a good value.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different razors over the year and this ranks at the top.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does a very good job on my blond weak stubble, so perhaps I&#x27;m not the best person to review, as my hair is fine and not too hard to shave off in the first place.   </li>
      <li>It needs to be charged after 3-4 shaves, and I&#x27;ve used it with some success in the shower too.</li>
      <li>Remington must have given this baby serious thought and the result is a splendid product.</li>
      <li>The battery is fine, you only need to charge it once a week</li>
      <li>The key to a good shave using this is to not move around really quick, but to spend a few seconds at each location.</li>
      <li>At best I get 3-4 shaves and don&#x27;t even think about leaving uncharged for a few days, it will go dead.</li>
      <li>I upgraded from the 9120 and was much happier with this razor.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It loses a star because I hoped it would be as good as a non-electric...</li>
      <li>and you get a decent shave.  </li>
      <li>This Remington looked very similar to my Norelco and had many of the same features and was 1/2 the price</li>
      <li>This is a decent shaver for the price...</li>
      <li>It seems that the more gadgets and displays the shavers have, the more likely thay are to fail.</li>
      <li>I returned it for another unit and it did exactly the same thing.</li>
      <li>Cleaning is as easy as placing it under running water for a few seconds.</li>
      <li>Have used Norelco shaver for several years and was ready for a new shaver.</li>
      <li>The next day, not so much (the motor sounds like it is going slower).  </li>
      <li>They are far below the norm.  </li>
      <li>Overall a good razor, however my skin seemed to take a long time(at least 2 weeks)before adjusting to this razor.</li>
      <li>The plastic cover for the heads broke quickly and never fit snuggly.  </li>
      <li>The day after that, a bit slower, and usually within 4-5 days it is struggling to keep me clean shaven.  </li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to use at your house, and keep plugged in all the time, and you will not be disappointed, it&#x27;s a great shaver.  </li>

<li> The charge on the battery does not last long.  </li>
<li> Now it is a question of how long this battery will last.</li>
<li> Although the head is a wee bit awkward to open, once mastered, the razor is simple to rinse and easy to maintain.</li>
<li> While I would not dribble on a basketball court with this or any electric, it is constructed sturdily and should provide a long life.</li>
<li> Got the product and started using it right away.. the first few days were painful....</li>
<li> I have read a few others who state the same thing.  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t get a third shave before it quits dead.   </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t let the other reviews fool you.</li>
<li> One for myself and other a gift for my brother.</li>
<li> It gives a close shave without applying much pressure, but I found it difficult to get a few hairs out in the chin area...</li>
<li> (hopefully you buy it for less than fifty).   </li>
<li> After only a few months the battery started to fail and then worked only  with a cord.  </li>
<li> Difficult to clear the stubs below the jaws.</li>
<li> There is only one flaw that keeps me from giving this a 5 star and that is hair under the chain is difficult to shave,  </li>
<li> However the battery is weak.</li>
<li> But what&#x27;s the use if the re-chargeable battery is so bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought it years ago.  It was just ok.</li>
    <li> While no electric will shave as closely or smoothly as a regular safety razor (try the Schick Quattro)this Remington comes in as a close second. Aside from a great shave, there is no razor pull or burn and no break-in period with the Titanium head. Although the head is a wee bit awkward to open, once mastered, the razor is simple to rinse and easy to maintain. While I would not dribble on a basketball court with this or any electric, it is constructed sturdily and should provide a long life. Remington must have given this baby serious thought and the result is a splendid product.</li>
    <li> Overall a good razor, however my skin seemed to take a long time(at least 2 weeks)before adjusting to this razor. I experienced a lot of cuts at first. It is easy to clean and maintain</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over nine months now. It still shaves fine with the original set of rotating blades. You can&#x27;t expect the quality of a non-electric, though. The key to a good shave using this is to not move around really quick, but to spend a few seconds at each location. Cleaning is as easy as placing it under running water for a few seconds. It needs to be charged after 3-4 shaves, and I&#x27;ve used it with some success in the shower too. &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good value for the money. &lt;br /&gt;It loses a star because I hoped it would be as good as a non-electric... I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any product out there that is. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Great clean shave. Good value for money. However the battery is weak. At best I get 3-4 shaves and don&#x27;t even think about leaving uncharged for a few days, it will go dead.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;premium\\&quot; shaver gives a close shave but leaves my face irritated.  After only a few months the battery started to fail and then worked only  with a cord.  This is my third experience with Remington battery failures.  They are far below the norm.  It seems that the more gadgets and displays the shavers have, the more likely thay are to fail.</li>
    <li> This is a decent shaver for the price... (hopefully you buy it for less than fifty).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does a very good job on my blond weak stubble, so perhaps I&#x27;m not the best person to review, as my hair is fine and not too hard to shave off in the first place.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The electric shaver irritates my skin a bit, but all shavers do that, I was hoping this might be better.  It isn&#x27;t.  (Nivea lotion works wonders however). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed is on a FULL charge, if you use the shaver right after unplugging it from the wall, it works AWESOME.  The next day, not so much (the motor sounds like it is going slower).  The day after that, a bit slower, and usually within 4-5 days it is struggling to keep me clean shaven.  So, I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to use at your house, and keep plugged in all the time, and you will not be disappointed, it&#x27;s a great shaver.  Not the best one to keep in your car for 5 o&#x27;clock shadow or for travelling in the Amazon jungle with no power outlets in sight. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I had the preceeding model to this and it lasted 5 yrs. It still runs on a cord.... The trimmer broke after 4yrs, but never replaced the heads and used it daily.  The batteries finally gave up so I decided to buy another. For 50 bucks, it was a good deal too.  Electric is never as close as a blade, but this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> It shaves adequately, nothing exceptional, but you better keep it plugged in.  After two shaves, the battery life indicator is at 80%.  You won&#x27;t get a third shave before it quits dead.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most others reviewing this product have the same experience.</li>
    <li> Got the product and started using it right away.. the first few days were painful.... now the skin has gotten used to it...the charge indicator is excellent. It gives a close shave without applying much pressure, but I found it difficult to get a few hairs out in the chin area... do not know if it is because of the shape of my chin... which is not an unusual one.. overall an excellent product.</li>
    <li> The item is good and met my expectations. Though battery needs some work as it gets discharged sitting idle. But then you have got a charger for that. &lt;br /&gt;Good buy</li>
    <li> Shaving closeness-pretty good for the first year, when the sidburn shaver stopped working, and I replaced it with a Braun Syncho 7526! The batteries in the Remington gave me five shaves max. The Braun: 11 and still counting! Replace the Remington cutters in a year. The Braun: 18mos! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;   No comparison between the Remington and the Braun! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco shaver for several years and was ready for a new shaver. This Remington looked very similar to my Norelco and had many of the same features and was 1/2 the price so I decided to try it. While I was impressed with the quality and the close shave I found that the battery lost its charge very quickly even when it was not being used. I returned it for another unit and it did exactly the same thing. So it seems like they are having some battery issues with this model (9270)! It is not quite the same quality as the Norelco, but for the difference in price it is definetly a good value.  Now it is a question of how long this battery will last. It does have a 2 year warranty, so I would make sure I kept my receipt.</li>
    <li> It is Good. Difficult to clear the stubs below the jaws.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the other reviews fool you. The battery is fine, you only need to charge it once a week and you get a decent shave.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor is good enough for years of use.</li>
    <li> After 7 months of use,  I thought my neck was adjusting but no.  It makes my neck sore.  The charge on the battery does not last long.  The plastic cover for the heads broke quickly and never fit snuggly.  I will never buy Remington again</li>
    <li> This razor works great nice and close no follow-up with a straigth edge</li>
    <li> I feel that remington should recall these items. The Shaver is real good. But what&#x27;s the use if the re-chargeable battery is so bad. I got two of these. One for myself and other a gift for my brother. He has the same battery issues. I see similar reviews about this product. &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t shave cordless for more than 10 secs. What&#x27;s the point? I will never even consider a Remington product in future.</li>
    <li> A good shaver, comfortable to use.  So far so good.  Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is not the best electric razor in the world, but gives a nice shave for the value!  I have tried many different razors over the year and this ranks at the top.  I upgraded from the 9120 and was much happier with this razor.  There is only one flaw that keeps me from giving this a 5 star and that is hair under the chain is difficult to shave,  I have read a few others who state the same thing.  Other than that it is a GREAT razor!  hope that helps!</li>
