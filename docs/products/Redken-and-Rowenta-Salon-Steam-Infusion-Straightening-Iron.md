      <li>Thank you Redken/Rowenta for putting your brilliant heads together and coming up with this flat iron!!  </li>
      <li>I cannot believe how silky, shiny, healthy &amp; just plain wonderful</li>
      <li>I was excited to try it after reading good reviews, and still am just absolutely blown away from the result.</li>
      <li>Nothing about this item is cheap.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really probably the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in the last five years.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>it is worth the price!</li>
      <li>It is pricy but well worth it!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to get it this straight!  </li>
      <li>I found it on amazon and was sooo excited to try it out.</li>
      <li>totally worth the price!  </li>
      <li>Kind of gives new meaning to hair life.  </li>
      <li>When you combine it with the smoothing serum and creme, it&#x27;s pure hair magic--but again, you gotta be patient and let it do its magic.</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair straight and smooth!</li>
      <li>turning it on and off isn&#x27;t wonderfully designed and (of course) it needs to have filled with water, so not ideal for travel.  </li>
      <li>It so easy  to learn how to use and soooo fast</li>
      <li>However, when I tried using it for the 3rd time yesterday, the iron &#x27;s power light didn&#x27;t wanted to turn on, neither did the iron warmed up!!</li>
      <li>But to my surprise it is amazing , I had a chi straightener  prior to this one</li>
      <li>No warranty is listed here, so it&#x27;s up to you if you think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It was truly worth every penny to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I never post reviews, but this product is worth it.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about it.</li>
      <li>but as the result was nice (silky smooth hair without the &amp;#34;poker straight hair&amp;#34; look) I decided to keep it and to use it only from time to time.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;it is flat out AMAZING</li>
      <li>this is an amazing flat iron.</li>
      <li>I have not had good luck curling my hair with this iron but that is probably due to my lack of skill.</li>
      <li>but you get used to it right away.  </li>
      <li>The only issue I have is my hair is very fine</li>
      <li>I have very very curly hair</li>
      <li>actually it looks better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>but i was willing to go to that amount if i needed too.</li>
      <li>If you want to try what it feels like first, make an appointment at an ULTA salon and ask for a steam fusion blowout treatment.  </li>
      <li>This iron worked exactly as it did in the salon.</li>
      <li>Only had to pass it once through my hair and it was soooo shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I give it four stars because the price is still pretty hefty for what you get.</li>
      <li>You will most likely love it, then come back and buy it so you can do it yourself.</li>
      <li>feels smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>the steam doesn&#x27;t come out consistently and you have to &amp;#34;monkey&amp;#34; with it a bit.</li>
      <li>I love the Redken &amp; Rowenta Salon Steam Flat Iron...</li>
      <li>This iron offers the same quality as my full size and is much more portable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!!!!! I have 4c hair with high shrinkage around 80% and that is natural. I am lazy so I do not add a lot of heat but I wanted my hair as straight as possible for the most accurate cut and not feel as guilty with the heat. This flat iron leaves my shiny and poker straight, like it was just relaxed. I also used Ouidad&#x27;s heat and humidity frizz control line shampoo, conditioner, gel and glosser, but I like I would still get the same results with just a heat protectant and the flat iron, but loved Ouidad products as well. Worth the money, if you want something long lasting in both product and results than an ordinary flat iron and more gentler on the hair with moist heat. Get it, my natural curly ladies!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about it. Couldn&#x27;t manage or maneuver it.</li>
    <li> I have very very curly hair and I color it. Everyday straightening it&#x27;s bad for my hair but I do it everyday even though my hair looks like s**t! UNTIL I USE THIS! love it love it love it:)</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this straightener because of the price. But to my surprise it is amazing , I had a chi straightener  prior to this one and I hated the way my hair felt after using it. It was dry and rough but with this one my straightening time has gone from 35 mins to literally 8 mins and hair feels smooth and soft. I have very thick hair and I am so glad I have found the perfect straightener. Hopefully it will last a few years.</li>
    <li> Arrived in 2 days..I&#x27;ve only used a few times, but can&#x27;t believe how well it works!  I have thick, wavy, (frizzy) coarse hair...and I&#x27;ve never been able to get it this straight!  I&#x27;ve had my hair professionally straightened...and it was never this straight! Love this iron..totally worth the price!  And, works faster then my chi--only one pass over each section! Hopefully, the iron will last a long time...would hate to have to replace after a year.</li>
    <li> Is it wrong to love an inanimate object??  Not if it is this flat iron!  I cannot believe how silky, shiny, healthy &amp; just plain wonderful my hair becomes when I use this iron.&lt;br /&gt;Every woman in my office has complimented my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; hair!!  My &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair was very thick, coarse and wavy to kinky curly if I didn&#x27;t beat it into submission.  It didn&#x27;t grow long, it just grew bushy and I just hated how much time it took to do.  I&#x27;m using the Redken Frizz Dismiss line, along with this iron and it&#x27;s made all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I got sticker shock when I saw the price of this iron, but considering the small fortune I&#x27;ve  spent in 50+ years of bad hair days on potions and devices that didn&#x27;t work, it is so worth it.  Find a salon that uses the professional version - I had a blow out done at an Ulta salon - and see what it can do for you.  Thank you Redken/Rowenta for putting your brilliant heads together and coming up with this flat iron!!  It&#x27;s amazing and I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> Really holds the straight in hair.</li>
    <li> I have very kinky, curly hair. Every single flat iron I have ever used has left frizz or failed to conquer the beast. This flat iron however, has left my hair feeling soft, manageable, straight, shiny, and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Great product and it is worth the price! I wash my daughter&#x27;s hair and let it air dry overnight and then use it!  No blow drying needed and it makes the hair silky smooth!  It&#x27;s a bit bulky but I got used to it easily!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am in beauty school only 2 weeks from graduating and I learned about this iron i a class taught by my caucasion teacher &amp; Im black so u all know that there is a big difrence in our hair types. But this particular teacher is white yet she is awesome at styling both black and whites, mexican, mixed ect hair..... Being that I was looking to buy a hair steamer cuz I love how weel the steam works on conditioning hair, When she told us she had it, I had to go buy it. She has the other one with the bigger tank. I have this one with the smaller. even tho the price is diff its the same exact iron and the water tank on this is more travel size then the one with the bigger. Thus she allowed me to bring it to school and we used it on someone who had fried her hair with too much bleqaching.It brought it bck to LIFE and it was so Soft and healthy looking, it sealed and smoothed out the bad frizzy ends and was so bouncy... Then i took it home and used it on my daughter hair who is natural. using no other product but about 10 drops of redkin diamond oil and it did the same for my daughter. If i could post pics on here b4 and after i would. Its now been a week and i havent touched my daughter hair at all, just to see how well it really last. I have allowed her to sleep on it without a scarf and bonnet and the only thing that did curl bck up is the lil edges but they were kinda too short for me to grab anyway. The bulkyness of the iron scared me into buying the agave one 1st, but it did nothing so i took it back. I see that if u take smaller sections u can get to the base of the hair alot better. And it is made for a stylist use so it may be harder to use on yourself because the hair only goes in one one side and it goes the a comb and steam on the out or exit side. The steam does not over steam the hair or burn and its kinda impossible to burn someone cuz there appears to be a guard form the scalp as well...... Price wise Ive heard it can cost up too $300. I CAUGHT A SELL paying half that amount because MY price at the professonal stores are cheaper with my cosmetalogy liscense ...but i was willing to go to that amount if i needed too.</li>
    <li> Great a flat ironing natural coarse hair.  What normally takes 2 hours takes 30 minutes.  We do go back and use a regular flat irom for the extra straight look.  My 3 girls hair stay straight for 2-4 weeks depending on the Texas humidity.</li>
    <li> This is a good straightener for African American 4B/C hair types however the iron is too wide and cannot allow for straightening close to the roots of the hair or the shorter baby hair around the hairline. I do love the tension comb attachment and I wish more companies made these with combs as its convenient. The price however is over priced and I do NOT like how the plates of the iron seem to roughly skate over the hair instead of providing a smoother glide over the hair from root to end.</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron on January 21st 2015 and used it only 2 times as I found it pretty difficult to use due to its size and design.  In fact, it&#x27;s bulkiness and weight causes me extreme discomfort after little time of holding it but as the result was nice (silky smooth hair without the &amp;#34;poker straight hair&amp;#34; look) I decided to keep it and to use it only from time to time. However, when I tried using it for the 3rd time yesterday, the iron &#x27;s power light didn&#x27;t wanted to turn on, neither did the iron warmed up!! After spending that much money for this product, I was expecting to get a good quality and long-lasting item, I was wrong!!! I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and I advise you not to make the same mistake, it&#x27;s just pouring money down the drain....</li>
    <li> Best iron I ever used. I wish they made one even smaller. This straightens my air dried hair with out an issue I have long dense kinky curly hair, that takes hours to straighten. With this iron all I had to do was air dry over night and then next day on DRY hair I flat ironed my hair for 45 min and was done. My hair did not poof up for 5 days. Usually my hair proofs the same day I straighten it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my straightening iron for well over a year now and it&#x27;s really probably the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in the last five years. After a year of solid use, my hair still looks great, the appliance has never given me a problem, and I&#x27;m as in love with it as the day I got it. I never thought a device could keep my frizzy hair straight in Southeastern summer humidity, especially after a 30-minute walk to work with a sweltery breeze blowing in my hair. And it takes only three or four minutes to achieve this! It was truly worth every penny to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My photos show my hair after it was washed and dried. The second is after 3 minutes with the steam iron.</li>
    <li> I lucked out and won the one with the bigger water tank and ebay, and let me tell you, it is one of the best purchases I have made. This got my hair soft, and silky in one pass on 350 degrees. I am African American with coarse, natural hair that has not been relaxed since 1991 and is down to my lower back, so for me to be able to straighten it with just one pass is amazing. Normally, the iron would have to be up around 400 degrees to do a decent job, but not with this iron. I also did not need to use a ton of product to get it straight; I just used Beyond the Zone heat protectant that I purchased at Sally&#x27;s. Also, I did use Chi Keratin Mist and Organix Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Penetrating Oil before blow drying my hair. Would I say that this flat iron is work the price? Yes, without a doubt! Anything that will allow me to straighten my hair while turning down the heat and get soft, silky smooth hair is more than worth it. Do not hesitate to purchase this iron! You will be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I love this steampod, it makes my hair silky smooth and shiny. I cant live without it, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this flat iron from my salon last October. I found it on amazon and was sooo excited to try it out. Got a bit scared at the price but decided to try it anyway. I have very coarse, dry wavy and thick thick hair. Each strand of hair almost looks like cringkly wire. I have a chi that I thought was a miracke worker but nope. This is awesome. I washed and blow dried my hair and the flat iron with this,,,oh,,,my,,,Gosh,,,, Amazing.. Only had to pass it once through my hair and it was soooo shiny and healthy. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Took me 20 minutes when it usually takes me 1 hour. Im on day 3 today and my hair looks just like it did on day 1. It will last till you wash your hair again. My hair is soo soft and shiny still. This has never happened before with any products or flat irons ive used. Its been 100% humidity the last 2 days but there is absolutely no frizz on my hair. Believe me when I say this is the best money you will ever spend.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works perfectly and very very good quality made material. Nothing about this item is cheap. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Gets my hair straighter on a lower heat setting than other flatirons. Still damages hair, as heat will do, though.</li>
    <li> I have the commercial version of this steam iron and LOVE it; however, when traveling, it is too big to take with me. This iron offers the same quality as my full size and is much more portable. My only wish is that I cannot find de- mineralized water anywhere- so I have been using distilled. I&#x27;ve attached photos of my naturally curly hair and straightened hair. I live in Florida where we endure 150% humidity! I can get two days of completely straight hair before having to wash, etc. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I saw this iron at my beautician. She used this iron on my hair and it was BONE straight I new I had to have one.&lt;br /&gt;It works better than any other iron straightener on the market.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. I haven&#x27;t opened it up yet to try. Will update when I do. THANKS.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend want from an hour to straighten her hair to 15 minutes with this. Seems to keep hair feeling smooth and healthy. It lasts for 3 days without any touch up .</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so smooth, I love it, but it&#x27;s very heavy for me.  By the time I finished straightening my hair, my hand wrist is so sore.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this flat iron. It works great. My hair is not only straight but silky and smooth. It does take some getting used to how you hold it. It smooths in one direction only. I consulted my hairdresser about the proper temperature to use on my hair.  I saw cheaper products but they require that you buy oil to put into the curling iron. This only needs water and that is free. My hair looks professional every time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several straighteners in my life. Some of them with steam, some of them not. This straightener is just out of this world. I was excited to try it after reading good reviews, and still am just absolutely blown away from the result. Is this straightener for reals? My hair is so soft and shiny afterwards, and I thought I had really decent hair to start with. Think Redken invested a lot of R&amp;D becaues it has 4-5 patents surrounding the technology, seems like for really good reason. If you want to invest in something that really gets the job done, get this one.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t ever take this straightener off of the market!  I have naturally curly/frizzy/thick hair and the only thing I hate is that it took me until I turned 30 years old to find this hair tool!&lt;br /&gt;A little heavy but completely worth it for the soft silky smooth results you get.</li>
    <li> Great iron. It completely smoothed my hair straight and shiny. And my hair is spiral wavy kinky curly straight. Hey im from the Carribean lots of ethnicities are mixed into my hair lol. To get even faster smoothing use this iron with Aveda smooth and straight blow dry lotion. It would take only 10 min. to smooth your entire head.</li>
    <li> The best hair steam iron ever...</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian with thick shoulder-length hair and received this item as a gift.  It leaves my hair straight and shiny with no burned, fly away ends and I love that I do not have to use product to achieve desired results. It is bulky to store and heavy. It took a few times to learn how to &amp;#34;load&amp;#34; my hair into the iron. I have not had good luck curling my hair with this iron but that is probably due to my lack of skill. You have to use distilled water. Definitely the best flatiron I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener ever!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing flat iron. works so well to straighten hair smoothly and gives it a nice shine. so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;easy to use. works well.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this works pretty well on it. It is a little awkward to use on some parts because you can only use it in one direction. Also, I don&#x27;t seem to get much steam for some reason. My hairdresser has one, so I&#x27;ll ask her what the problem might be. This is an expensive flatiron but  I am mostly happy with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!  Works wonders, especially for folks with kinky hair. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Kind of gives new meaning to hair life.  it is that good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is mature, colored, with highlights and light ombre at the ends, dry and delicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron leaves it looking terrific, not dry or damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives it a soft, lustrous smoothing that looks like I just came from the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No actually it looks better. Thanks to the steam it looks healthy and keeps a little body in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not flat iron that often, but when I do, this will be my go to tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is flat out AMAZING</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a hot tool addict for years and CANNOT stress how great this one is. I bought it after a friend recommended the L&#x27;Oreal Steam Pod (not available in the US, but she&#x27;s an Aussie/Londoner lucky gal!) It does take extra time to get to know it, and patience is key, but I used it for the heck of it without any other products and after three turns on each section, there was such bounce and shine! When you combine it with the smoothing serum and creme, it&#x27;s pure hair magic--but again, you gotta be patient and let it do its magic. Once you get the hang of it, you won&#x27;t believe how great it is. Finally, it costs a mini fortune, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have thick, color treated, curly hair and the steam infusion straightens it with ease (one to two passes on the lowest heat setting).  My hair is sooo soft when done with this compared to a flat iron.  If my house were on fire this is one of the things I would go back for (kidding).  Pricey but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that when I tested the hardness of my water with the enclosed test strip it was a little on the hard side and recommended using 1/2 demineralized water.  I cannot find demineralized water in a store.  I have tried all hardware stores as recommended and other stores can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair straight &amp; sleek.  I had to use my other flat iron to finish the job.  Maybe if you have thinner hair it might work.</li>
    <li> This is just amazing.  Unlike regular flat irons, this one doesn&#x27;t damage the hair and leaves it smooth as silk, not hard and brittle. Definitely worth the money.  It is a bit heavy but you get used to it right away.  You also get used to handling it as recommended. Not &amp;#34;painful &amp;#34; as someone posted.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have mid back length 4c natural hair. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair often- maybe annually and if I&#x27;m going to invest the time to straighten it I want it to actually work. My hair straightened more with this product then any other method that I&#x27;ve tried at home. The device can be a little hard to handle yourself since it needs to only go in one direction: its not exactly designed for self use. I didn&#x27;t use the suggested temperature for course hair because I wasn&#x27;t going for bone straight hair and to reduce the possibility of heat damage.</li>
    <li> I love the Redken &amp; Rowenta Salon Steam Flat Iron... It keeps my hair straight n shiny for days. The only issue I have is my hair is very fine n the lowest setting still seems a bit to high for my hair..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener. I can straight my daughter&#x27;s hair in 15 min. Straight the hair without removing the volume. Love it love it love it.</li>
    <li> Great for bi-racial hair, calms the frizz makes hair amazingly soft and silky!  I would highly recommend this.  I bought this for my daughter whom is mixed and this is the only straightener that holds the press, especially because we live in Maui where it is extremely humid.  A great investment.</li>
    <li> This is perfect! Leaves your hair straight and smooth!</li>
    <li> I had this steam iron used on my hair in a salon and loved it. The iron the salon used had a bigger tank so I was a little skeptical when I ordered this. This iron is the home use version and let me say, it did not disappoint. I have thick course hair that is curly &amp; frizzy. This iron worked exactly as it did in the salon. It is pricy but well worth it! Love Love Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Update... I have such mixed feelings about this. Without a doubt, it was the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. It significantly cut down on styling time and I got MUCH better results. That said, the water reservoir cracked after just a few months. The water now leaks everywhere and it no longer functions as a steamer. The plates still work, but the results are not as good and it takes a lot longer to straighten my hair. No warranty is listed here, so it&#x27;s up to you if you think it&#x27;s worth it. I still give it three stars because it was easily the best until it broke.  I have color treated, greying, wavy hair. I&#x27;m caucasion, but my hair is frizzy and difficult to control. I was under the impression that you could use this on wet hair, so I was a bit disappointed when the instructions state to dry hair prior to use. However, I air dried my hair and this steamer easily smoothed and straightened my hair. It shined and smoothed my hair like a salon treatment. I&#x27;ve never gotten  these results with my Chi iron. And it was easier to use than the Chi. It does require some awkward handling to insure the steam is positioned correctly over the hair. However, it&#x27;s very manageable.  Marketing reports that this tool actually helps improve the condition of your hair by infusing conditioners more deeply into the hair. So far so good. I give it four stars because the price is still pretty hefty for what you get.</li>
    <li> I never post reviews, but this product is worth it.  This is the best straightener ever.  My hair and my daughter&#x27;s both look like we had a brazilian keratin treatment without the chemicals.  I have wavy hair and one pass per section made my hair perfect.  My daughter has super curly thick hair that turns to look dry.  Her hair came out so shiny with natural movement.  It&#x27;s been about 5 days since I did her hair and the results are still noticeable.  Usually she complains because of the heat of the flat iron and the blow drier bother hair.  I washed and conditioned and let the hair air dry then straightened.  The results were fast and she did not even complain.  I had half a steam reservoir left when I finished my hair.  It took a whole one for my daughter, but her hair is super long and thick.  Yes, this is an expensive item, but I&#x27;ve seen in for more in other sites. In addition, I am saving on salon treatments and salon results.  Salon trips for me and my daughter cost about a $100 for both of us, so this thing is paid for after 2 uses.  If you want to try what it feels like first, make an appointment at an ULTA salon and ask for a steam fusion blowout treatment.  Experience it.  You will most likely love it, then come back and buy it so you can do it yourself.</li>
    <li> This product will give you very shiny straight hair (much more so than a regular flat iron)... which is terrific.  The down side is it&#x27;s kinda clunky with 3 large cords... turning it on and off isn&#x27;t wonderfully designed and (of course) it needs to have filled with water, so not ideal for travel.  This product is one you&#x27;d keep at home and travel with a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; straightener.  There are a couple of downsides to this steamer straightener:&lt;br /&gt;1) the steamer has a bit of a funky mildew scent.&lt;br /&gt;2) it&#x27;s awkward to handle.  Make sure to follow the direction of the arrows.&lt;br /&gt;3) the steam doesn&#x27;t come out consistently and you have to &amp;#34;monkey&amp;#34; with it a bit.</li>
    <li> For those of you who straighten your hair every day like myself and are trying to grow your hair out but can&#x27;t give it up...this product is the best thing that has ever EVER happened to my hair. I have tried keratin treatments, chi straightening treatments, every flat iron there is..I have never loved a straightening tool as much as i love this one. It so easy  to learn how to use and soooo fast so I did not have to keep going over the same sections. my hair is finally growing and i can keep it straight every day!!! BUY THIS! 100% best purchase ever. So sad I just found it.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price and very satisfied</li>
