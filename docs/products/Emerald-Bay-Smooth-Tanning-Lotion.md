      <li>It even came with a cute little starfish anklet/rear-view mirror hanger/whatever you want to do with it, which I know realize is pictured in the photo, wrapped around the neck of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, but there is some sort of chemical in this that caused me to break out in hives.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again and other products Emerald Bay has to offer :)</li>
      <li>I have fairly sensitive skin, so bronzers and tingle are out the window for me.</li>
      <li>I tan quickly and dark already,</li>

    <li> Love this product! Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I Love &amp;#34;Emerald Bay &amp;#34;. I got the results I was looking for.....it is FANTASTIC!!!  Thank you so much......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Janice Harr</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. I like the smell.</li>
    <li> For the same lotion that is way more expensive in the tanning places, this lotion does what it says. After 2 uses, I noticed I was getting darker and I was only going for about 7 mins both times. The smell before and after is nice. Its not like a tanning bed smell. Very light.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion and another one by someone else on the same day...this one I like and thank you it also wasn&#x27;t expired like the other lotion I purchased from the other seller and this lotion was also cheaper than the expired lotion from the other seller. Will be delighted to buy from you again..</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you much darker but does moisturize.</li>

    <li> Smells nice. Works okay.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle from a salon and loved it. So, when I found I could get it cheaper from Amazon, it seemed like a no-brainer. The bottle looked the same, but the lotion inside was like sludge and smelled slightly different. Not the real stuff. Probably transplanted with a cheaper product. Been seeing a lot of these types of reviews for Green Web Inc products lately.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, but there is some sort of chemical in this that caused me to break out in hives. Just a warning. Make sure you look at the label ingredients before you buy, so you don&#x27;t have the same effects I had.</li>
    <li> Great for just starting in the tanning bed till you get a base!</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive skin, so bronzers and tingle are out the window for me. This lotion smells good, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is a little intimidating, but I&#x27;ve had no reactions yet.</li>
    <li> It smells very good - like juicy pineapple. And I like that it doesn&#x27;t have bronzer, because bronzers tend to make my palms turn orange after applying, unless I stand there and scrub them before getting into the bed. It even came with a cute little starfish anklet/rear-view mirror hanger/whatever you want to do with it, which I know realize is pictured in the photo, wrapped around the neck of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is most definitely worth the money.  I tan easily and like the accelerators and this  product is  perfect!</li>
    <li> smells wonderful. leaves skin dark and soft. its a keeper.</li>
    <li> Good basic lotion. Hydrates well and is the best smelling tanning lotion I&#x27;ve found. I tan quickly and dark already, so I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference that I can attribute to this particular lotion. Great lotion if you are tanning and not showering after. Delicious, long lasting pineapple smell!</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Nice smell. Would recommend to anyone.  Very happy with this purchase. Glad it didn&#x27;t contain bronzers or heat/tingle factor.</li>
