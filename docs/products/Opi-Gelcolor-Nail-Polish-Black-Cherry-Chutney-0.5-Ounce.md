    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI!!!</li>
    <li> I love the color and it is easy to apply! It looks like I went to the salon to have this done.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to try because I have always used shellac and Gelish brands and I love the application and will definitely be getting more to add to my collection .</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Very nice quality!</li>
    <li> I received the nail polish today and it was exactly what I ordered. I really love the color but it doesn&#x27;t dry. I waiting for 40 minutes and it was as if I had just applied it. I had to take it all off. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because I love OPI brand. Threw the bottle out.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love this color, very easy to put on too. It is a dark shade of purple with hints of purple shimmer</li>
    <li> One of my favortie fall/winter colors! Goes on beautifully and last just about 2 weeks. My nails grow fast so I can never go that long. All in all, great product and lovely color! I&#x27;ve been using Shellac and Opi gelcolor for over a year and I&#x27;ll never go back to regular polish.</li>
    <li> Color was not the same as what is shown.  It is a very dark purple, almost black in appearance.</li>
    <li> I like the color although its not the color I originally wanted. It looks like a burgundy purple in the pic &amp; its actually waay darker..</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and I love the color!!! Very winter/fall look. It goes with everything and I received many compliments about the color</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own &amp;#34;shellaced&amp;#34; nails for over a year now. I do feel like you get more for your money when buying OPI vs CND. I think both brands equally worked well but I am used to the OPI handle so it is easier for me to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good dark color, very similar to Vampsterdam</li>
    <li> Wonderful winter color..............have worn it for several years and still love it all the way through the month of March.</li>
    <li> The color cures fast, but it bleeds onto the nail bed. I am careful and apply thin coats but it seeps onto the skin and looks very sloppy. It is a pretty color, but not the best quality of the OPI gel colors.</li>
    <li> The color is nowhere near the color of the cap.  The polish looks black.  Not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and well before the delivery window! I haven&#x27;t been able to try the color on yet, as I have a ton of gel polishes, but I did take a look at the color and its beautiful!</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time for Christmas gifting. Person receiving was thrilled.</li>
    <li> Nice color for fall/winter. It&#x27;s very, VERY dark. You can barely see the &amp;#34;cherry,&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s there. It&#x27;s one of my go-to fall colors.</li>
    <li> This is a great dark burgundy shade, almost appears black it is so dark.  It has a hint of sparkle, but this can only be seen in the sunlight, otherwise it appears Matte.  Like it, but not jumping up and down about it.</li>
