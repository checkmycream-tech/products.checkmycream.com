      <li>Very happy with this product it came with the box that makes it easy to store and the razors matched the description given for the razors.</li>
      <li>they take the hair of eyebrows really good</li>
      <li>The item pictured is in a nice display box and has the brand name &amp;#34;Twinkle&amp;#34;, which are good razors for the face.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>I love them and so does my clients!</li>
      <li>Great for shaving the fine hairs off of the face, but I can&#x27;t see using it on my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>These razors are inexpensive, but sturdy, and come in a cute, nicely organize box.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many shapers and these are by far, the best.</li>
      <li>OK I guess, don&#x27;t work that well</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>These razors are so cute</li>
      <li>Most of the razors are defective.  </li>
      <li>love these to fix eyebrows don&#x27;t have to pay to do them</li>
      <li>Second order - Works great!</li>
      <li>Will order more when I run out ^_^</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>$12 with free shipping!</li>
      <li>Love using these</li>
      <li>They work very well for disposable trimmers, so I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
      <li>it arrived quick and I am able to use it.</li>
      <li>so I bought another 3 pack to test against this 36 pack and there IS a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Plus the price for which I brought it was cheap.</li>
      <li>I felt my face and it felt smooth</li>
      <li>Great delivery time.. totally recommend it.</li>
      <li>Perfect little razors!</li>
      <li>These are decent - not a bad price, a good amount of them - but somewhat lacking in quality and rust pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I always get these, am glad they now offer in large quantity.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and were packaged well.</li>
      <li>Luckily I didn&#x27;t buy it for eyebrows.</li>
      <li>It works like a charm, it&#x27;s gentle and easy to control.</li>
      <li>Perfect and last a long time.</li>
      <li>These are great little razors for peach fuzz, or whatever.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic Value and fast delivery .</li>
      <li>Much more economical to spend a few dollars more than to buy them by the three pack.</li>
      <li>Good for people who like continually replacing them and having a fresh one, but a little wasteful.</li>
      <li>and she was impressed the first few days, but felt as I did, The bottom line, not really good for eyebrows, okay for the quick lip hair fix between waxing</li>
      <li>They are obviously a &#x27;knock off&#x27; of the much better brand &#x27;TINKLE&#x27; in the 3 pack.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll preface this review by saying that this is the first &amp;#34;eyebrow razor&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I use it on all facial hair , mostly my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>They come in a nice little display box like pictured.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, just what I wanted...</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for their intended use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to merely tweeting.</li>
      <li>and I usually by like 7 at a time Amazon I love you for caring all the stuff I need.</li>
      <li>This product does not work - do not waste your money!</li>
      <li>, they still work fine for the purpose and aren&#x27;t terrible, but I think next time we will probably spend a little more to get one good reusable/cleanable one vs. a bunch of these.</li>
      <li>Not very sharp and don&#x27;t work well at all</li>
      <li>They are a decent quality and will last me a long time.</li>

<li> they work well and last a long time</li>
<li> One case will last a long time.</li>
<li> These are not nearly the quality of the actual &amp;#34;Twinkle&amp;#34; brand I have purchased before.</li>
<li> u can use each one of them for a long time</li>
<li> I received the razors loose in a padded envelope (no box) and the name on the side of the razors is &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> It was too long but other than that</li>
<li> These have a very dull blade compared to the much smoother TINKLE shaver.  </li>
<li> I gave my daughter half of them in the beginning</li>
<li> These are so convenient to have since they come in a little box holder.</li>
<li> small and compact in size.</li>
<li> I am not impressed as the next day</li>
<li> this product is not effective at removing peach fuzz</li>
<li> Unable to use wax due to reactions to the wax, I discovered twinkle.</li>
<li> was afraid they&#x27;d be junk with some of the reviews.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how bad these were</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are great little razors for peach fuzz, or whatever.  Find a tutorial on youtube.</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller. Love using these</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many shapers and these are by far, the best.</li>
    <li> I love them and so does my clients!</li>
    <li> Fantastic Value and fast delivery .</li>
    <li> Perfect and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, just what I wanted...</li>
    <li> These are decent - not a bad price, a good amount of them - but somewhat lacking in quality and rust pretty quickly. Good for people who like continually replacing them and having a fresh one, but a little wasteful. I realize these are a lower level brand and that&#x27;s ok, they still work fine for the purpose and aren&#x27;t terrible, but I think next time we will probably spend a little more to get one good reusable/cleanable one vs. a bunch of these.</li>
    <li> I use these for my mustache and unibrow. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Unable to use wax due to reactions to the wax, I discovered twinkle. I use it on all facial hair , mostly my eyebrows. I even use it with lotion to work away peeling skin in the summer. It works like a charm, it&#x27;s gentle and easy to control. It&#x27;s a great alternative to merely tweeting. I&#x27;ve paid anywhere from $1 to 1.50 at the so called dollar store. Over the years, I estimate spending hundreds of dollars. One case will last a long time. At this price I save from $24-$36 per case.</li>
    <li> I always get these, am glad they now offer in large quantity.</li>
    <li> OK I guess, don&#x27;t work that well</li>
    <li> No they are not the tinkle brand but they seem to work just as well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I will probably return to the dreaded razors.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great delivery time.. totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> These razors are so cute I like how they come in different colors. small and compact in size. Will order more when I run out ^_^</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Much more economical to spend a few dollars more than to buy them by the three pack.</li>
    <li> It was too long but other than that it arrived quick and I am able to use it. Plus the price for which I brought it was cheap.</li>
    <li> they take the hair of eyebrows really good ans u can use each one of them for a long time</li>
    <li> I purchased these as my daughter sent me a YouTube video. They arrived quickly and were packaged well. As for my opinion, I felt like it was not doing anything, however, I saw a lot of what looked like &amp;#34;lint&amp;#34; on the blade. I felt my face and it felt smooth but I still saw hair. I am not impressed as the next day I felt peach fuzz. I gave my daughter half of them in the beginning and she was impressed the first few days, but felt as I did, The bottom line, not really good for eyebrows, okay for the quick lip hair fix between waxing but I will keep my lady face trimmer which I also purchased on Amazon</li>
    <li> these are very nice they work well and last a long time</li>
    <li> Second order - Works great!</li>
    <li> This is the best I used this every day and the price is great.the beauty supply store sell one for a dollar and I usually by like 7 at a time Amazon I love you for caring all the stuff I need.</li>
    <li> These work awesome! And the pack will last me and my girls years! Great bargain</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product it came with the box that makes it easy to store and the razors matched the description given for the razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review by saying that this is the first &amp;#34;eyebrow razor&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used.  I read from a couple sources that this is the best type of razor for dermaplaning, so I thought I&#x27;d give them a go.  These razors are inexpensive, but sturdy, and come in a cute, nicely organize box. Highly recommended for their intended use.</li>
    <li> 2/2015&lt;br /&gt;I just received my twinkle box of 36 razors! beautiful display in box as shown! work great! was afraid they&#x27;d be junk with some of the reviews. if twinkle is the off brand, they are awesome! $12 with free shipping! I paid like $5 for 3 razors at a store! I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love these! Never have to worry about peach fuzz again!</li>
    <li> Not very sharp and don&#x27;t work well at all</li>
    <li> Perfect little razors!</li>
    <li> Had a couple defective.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Clean job</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like these at all.  They are obviously a &#x27;knock off&#x27; of the much better brand &#x27;TINKLE&#x27; in the 3 pack.  These have a very dull blade compared to the much smoother TINKLE shaver.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how bad these were so I bought another 3 pack to test against this 36 pack and there IS a huge difference.  See for yourself.</li>
    <li> This product does not work - do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> Great for shaving the fine hairs off of the face, but I can&#x27;t see using it on my eyebrows. Luckily I didn&#x27;t buy it for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Does not work well and I bought way too may, save your money this product is not effective at removing peach fuzz</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as well as the Noxzema eyebrow shaper.</li>
    <li> Most of the razors are defective.  The blades have lifted edges on them which cut your skin.</li>
    <li> These are so convenient to have since they come in a little box holder. And they are a great price since you basically get 3 trimmers for every dollar you spend! They work very well for disposable trimmers, so I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> The product I received is a knock off. The item pictured is in a nice display box and has the brand name &amp;#34;Twinkle&amp;#34;, which are good razors for the face. I received the razors loose in a padded envelope (no box) and the name on the side of the razors is &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34;. These are not nearly the quality of the actual &amp;#34;Twinkle&amp;#34; brand I have purchased before. I think I can get only one use out of each one and they need to be thrown away. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Awesome and great price</li>
    <li> love these to fix eyebrows don&#x27;t have to pay to do them</li>
    <li> Great deal for 36 eyebrow shavers! They come in a nice little display box like pictured. They are a decent quality and will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Great price, excellent product.</li>
