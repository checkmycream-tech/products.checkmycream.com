<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am so happy that I was able to find Interlude on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for over 40 years.  My children, family and friends have noticed on the \\&quot;two\\&quot; occasions that I have worn something else.  It is \\&quot;my\\&quot; smell and I was getting concerned when I have drove all over town and could not find it anywhere.  Thank you and please never stop carrying this item.</li>
    <li> Especially for the lady with specific high class tastes, Interlude, offers subtle sultry &#x27;come hither&#x27; echo&#x27;s. It drives my husband into a &#x27;bedroom mood&#x27; everytime I wear it! Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this cologne for many years now. It is like a signature for me.</li>
    <li> The cologne was delivered as I expected and earlier than the stated time frame. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> My Mom loved this! I will definitely get it for her again, soon!</li>
    <li> My Mother has worn the perfume since she was a teenager. Everyone knew when my mother had arrived because you could smell her from a mile away. Interlude was a staple from my childhood. Anytime my parents would go out for the night, after kissing me goodbye, I could still smell her and it kept me feeling safe and comforted. My Mother was a trip, she loved her children so much and we loved her too. She would put the perfume on the dog just so the dog would never forget her, and always smell like her. Now sinced my mother has passed, on special occasions I will wear Interlude- sometimes when I am feeling sad and when I miss her I will put some on my pillow. Every time I wear it and hug someone they will always say, \\&quot;OH my Gosh, you smell just like your Mother...\\&quot; (and they will smell like her until they wash their clothes).... I really hope Interlude wont discontinue... its the next best thing then actually having her around...  Hopefully I will be able to pass the scent on once I have children of my own and they can tell the same silly story. It feels good to know there are certain people who wear the same perfume... you guys just KNOW exactly what I mean.... Interlude is a scent for your life....</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne at a really great price.  Received it in just a few days.  Great vendor and great product.</li>
    <li> Classic. This is a great fragrance, and is never mistaken for anything else. Guaranteed to get favorable comments!</li>
    <li> My wife thinks that this cologne is not of the same quality as the cologne that she has been buying for the last 25 years.</li>
    <li> She was glad to get her fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have worn Interlude cologne every day for over 30 years - since I was a young adult and finally switched over from the patchouli oil I wore as a teenager. I much prefer the cologne to the perfume, which I think smells very differently on me. I had been ordering from the Frances Denney company in Florida until I discovered Interlude products on Amazon - for a much better price! I want to echo all of the other wonderful reviews - this is the most intoxicating scent made. People comment on it all the time, but since it is not available locally, no one has ever heard of it. Thank you Amazon for carrying it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years though it&#x27;s getting hard to find in stores. I am so glad I found it on Amazon! It&#x27;s a timeless fragrance and I&#x27;ve always gotten complements on it. I think the fragrance complements all wearers individually, and never smells the same on different people, so it seems unique to you personally. I&#x27;ve tried different colognes over the years but never one that can replace my Interlude. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Interlude for 40 years. Everyone compliments me on it. Thank you for carrying it here. It&#x27;s impossible to find in the stores anymore. Great price. I will NEVER use another cologne! BUY IT! :-)</li>
    <li> I love this cologne, and have only been able to find it at a reasonable price through Amazon.  Only problem with this particular shipment is that the bottle sprayer stopped functioning after about 10 uses.  Although I can no longer spray from the bottle, I&#x27;ve taken the top of any can dab the cologne on.&lt;br /&gt;Not a major problem, but would be happier if it was still spraying.</li>
    <li> Ladies whatever you do ... don&#x27;t wear this if you are trying to get&lt;br /&gt;rid of a guy.  On the other hand should you wear this and the guy makes no&lt;br /&gt;mention of your frangrance.  He&#x27;s the wrong guy .. enjoy dinner ... and&lt;br /&gt;find a guy that does say the right things and buys as well.  Just sayhing ....</li>
    <li> Not the same as the original I wore years ago. Scent does not last as long. Still happy to be using it again</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been married for Sixty seven years and interlude is the only cologne she will use and it pleases me because she smells great.</li>
    <li> This is the only Women Cologne that I use. It is wonderful, the smell meets my body chemistry and does affect my sinuses. I will continue to order it along as you have it. Please keep me updated on all your specials. Eleanor</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne.  It is wonderful smelling and it is one of my favorite colognes.&lt;br /&gt;The smell does last for a long time and does not fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It&#x27;s the only one I can wear.  I&#x27;m allergic to perfumes.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this for almost 50 years. Hard to find in any stores, so I order on-line..</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite cologne/perfume. So nice to find it at such a great price,too ! What a great find.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this perfume back in the 60&#x27;s.  I am so glad I found it again, because stores had stopped carrying it.  it&#x27;s clean smelling and lasts all day.  It brings back good memories of the first time I smelled the fragrance on a co-worker.  I was hooked and wore it until I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my mother quite frequently, because it is hard to find in the store.  It&#x27;s also a great deal for the amount given.  It arrives well packed.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed because the it doesn&#x27;t always work.  The spray nozzle is broken and it came that way.  I would like to exchange it please.</li>
    <li> It is an old but very exotic fragrance to me.  It has been my favorite for over 50 years and I was delighted to find it for my wife of 61 years.  It brings back so many memories of years past.  The fragrance is totally distinct from any other fragrance and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Enjoy the fragrance. It is a light but gentle fragrance that does not offend. The bottle size for the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for many years, it has a soft, pleasant odor that stays with you all day. I was happy I found it again.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to still be able to get this and not have it not cost me an arm and a leg because it was discontinued a long time ago and. I received it quickly..the only frustrating thing is the spray mechanism sticks and is difficult to spray but I will survive it and I am still very happy thank you so much</li>
    <li> I give  the Interlude Spray Cologne three stars because the sprayer would not spray. I have to pour the cologne in my hand and splash it on my body. I would love to have a bottle that actually sprays! However, I still love the fragrance! I started using &amp;#34;Interlude&amp;#34; as a teenager,  when I received a bottle of the Bath &amp; Body Perfume as a high school graduation gift. From then on, I was hooked! I just hope the sprayer works on the next bottle that I order!</li>
    <li> Have used it for 50 years.  Get compliments every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Great Service on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Betty</li>
    <li> An old fragrance, but, a GOOD one!!!! Can no longer find in department stores. Found it for my Mother and she and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!! Fast delivery, packaged very well, wonderful price!!!!! VERY HAPPY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My Mother has been wearing this perfume since I was in my teens (I am now in my early 40&#x27;s), I started wearing it in my 20&#x27;s because she always smelled so good and people were always telling her that.  To this day, this is the ONLY perfume I ever get compliments on when I am out socially.  Definitely and oldy but goody!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this product since 1060s. Can only get it thru amazon which I am grateful. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the fragrance.  I wore this cologne fro a long time.  I was very disappointed when JC Penny stopped selling it and finally went on the Internet.  I was always complimented on this fragrance and now, I don&#x27;t want to wear it.  I still have some body powder, I know how it should smell and make me feel.  Judith Marczak</li>
    <li> It was something my wife has been looking for for sometime now. It was nowhere to be found in stores</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome! Thanks for the quick response.</li>
    <li> This is the only place where I can get my cologne and for this thank you. I hope you continue to carry this when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> She loves this perfume and wasn&#x27;t able to find It in the stores any longer. She was very happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> This product and shipping are awesome and I would strongly reccomend this product to friends. I bought this product for my dads girlfriend and she loves this scent. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Truly INTERLUDE .... Excellent service, great product</li>
    <li> The fragrance is incredibly wonderful as it has always been for the past 40 years!&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the pump on the atomizer keeps getting stuck.  Other than that I will always purchase this item.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for a family member. I was pleased with the price and the quick delivery time.</li>
    <li> I love Interlude!  It&#x27;s been my favorite for over 30 years and nothing else compares!  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it!</li>
    <li> This is still a very good cologne........however the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; has a different quality to it, not as lingering.  Quantity was more than expected.and packaging was stress free.</li>
    <li> Product was old and very dark in color.</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find fragrance that has been around for at least 45 years. My first bottle was a gift that many years ago. Get a lot of compliments how nice the fragrance smells. I can only find is online now. Love it!</li>
    <li> one of my favorite all time scents.  Wore this when I was in college, many years ago</li>
    <li> Fast delivery decent price</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume since the late 1980&#x27;s and love it.  I&#x27;ve had men and women ask me what I&#x27;m wearing because they loved the smell.  My complaint is that the spray pump hasn&#x27;t worked on the last 2 bottles I&#x27;ve purchased.  I have to push on it at least 10 times to get one little shot of perfume.  I finally got so disgusted I bought a different perfume to wear.  I would have rated this a 5 if it were not for the quality of their spray pump.  I would suggest they do better quality control or find someone else to purchase their spray pumps from.</li>
    <li> been buying this since the 60&#x27;s--hope it is always available.</li>
    <li> Love this scent; very sext</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected and the same thing I used to purchase at my local shopping mall</li>
    <li> I was really excited to find this product on line. Have loved this scent for many many years. Loved by men &amp; women</li>
    <li> Mom&#x27;s favorite fragrance. I was happy to find it for sale on-line, to give to her as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> My aunt used to wear this perfume when I was a little girl. I loved the way she smelled. Whenever I would smell it on other people it brought back good memories. Anyway I was somewhat disappointed when my bottle arrived in the mail. I was so excited when I saw the box. When I sprayed it however it just didn&#x27;t smell like the same perfume. Similar, but not the same. That&#x27;s the reason I can&#x27;t give this perfume five stars. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it still smells good and my husband likes it, but don&#x27;t spray too much because the smell comes off kind of old ladyish ( no offence.) the interlude I remember had a much softer smell. So not bad, but not great either. I hope this helps anybody else who is wanting to buy this perfume.</li>
    <li> I really do like this fragrance....it is indeed a sultry fragrance and reminds me of an Oriental.... the bottle is very generous as well.</li>
    <li> My older sister wore this years ago and it was her signature scent. I loved when she walked into a room wearing it. Still smells great. A little goes a long way...</li>
    <li> Love it1  Only perfume I&#x27;ll ever use.  Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue it.  It&#x27;s me!  Been using for ober 30 years!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite scent for fifty years. Yes, I am old but it still smells just the same as the first bottle did. A little goes a long way and does not fade quickly even in our dry climate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for years and the only available outlet is Amazon, as far as I know.</li>
    <li> My most favorite perfume in the world!  Such a wonderful scent, not  strong and overwhelming!  Great price!  Will most certainly order again! This order was for my husband to give me for Christmas!</li>
    <li> The best delivered in plenty of time.</li>
    <li> this is the best price ever, thank you, I love it</li>
    <li> The cologne has been toned down from what it used to be and the scent doesn&#x27;t last all day as it had in the past.</li>
    <li> I received the product in a timely manner but the spray button sticks when I use it and I have to manually pull it up to spray it again.</li>
    <li> A departure from the usual sweet, heavy, vanilla laden orientals.  &amp;#34;Interlude&amp;#34; is a softer, lighter oriental.  It is woodsy/mossy -- almost earthy.  This is dry and powdery and not too sweet.  &amp;#34;Interlude&amp;#34; is womanly and seductive rather than girly and blatantly sexy.  If you want something subtle and more sophisticated than usual this is it.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift...great price and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> She always has loved it! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because she&#x27;s getting older but she claims it smells a bit watered down. It&#x27;s very strong in my opinion. I can smell when she&#x27;s in town, for crying out loud!!</li>
    <li> Because Interlude has been discontinued, i have stocked up.  I have worn it for 40 years.  It is a classic.  My signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> Thank you for having this perfume, Its my moms favorite. The smell takes me back to my childhood, when my mom would play with me.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;Interlude&amp;#34; by Frances Denney since I got my first credit card in 1961 and I have been using Interlude ever since.  I have tried other perfunes throughout the years but always go back to my favorite.  Now I don&#x27;t even try anything else.  I am 70 years old and Interlude suits me just fine.  So many women ask me what I wear but I won&#x27;t tell them because I don&#x27;t want them smelling as good as I do (lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally broke down and gave it to a really close friend of mine for Christmas this year after making her promise never to tell anyone what she was wearing.  So, I hope Frances Denney NEVER stops making this product.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.  I can only get it on the internet and Amazon has always been good to me.  Thanks.  Lois A. Loving.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I love it.</li>
    <li> When my brother and I were in High School we would buy this for our mother for her birthday. Here we are 30 yrs later and her 80th birthday we decided we would do it again for her. She loved it!</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy it again. Once you find &amp;#34;your&amp;#34; fragrance, its hard to change to another.  Its like your calling card.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, very light and sexy.</li>
    <li> My Mother has worn only this fragrance for 50 years!</li>
    <li> Had to contact the company, because the bottles arrived broken, with two different deliveries. They made me take pictures as proof. The 1st package it was obvious that it was broken, because the package had a strong odor. I took pictures of package and returned it USPS. The 2nd package, did have an odor, but opened just to confirm &amp; indeed the bottle was shattered. Did take the pictures requested by company. The 3rd package arrived in a larger box, not damaged, but the bottle was very hot, that I had to refrigerate to cool down, Just know it was in Arizona at 108 temps.&lt;br /&gt;Lucky for my mom, I was visiting her in AZ, to follow up with package delivery. She knows nothing of technology &amp; has no internet, and would not know what to do. Glad I has my I-phone and I-pad.&lt;br /&gt;This is what she wanted and loves it!</li>
    <li> For those of you who have never worn this,  you have nothing to compare it to. For those of us who have worn this &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; for over 20 years......SAVE your money. This is NOT the original. It contains whisps of the original scent, and it is very faint. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely manner and the contents were original but the spray apparatus was sticky in the beginning then broke down at about when the bottle was half full.</li>
    <li> My mom is 62 and she wore this when I was a little girl. I like myself so of coarse the review will alway&#x27;s be positive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Interlude for 20+ years and it&#x27;s the only cologne I wear. It&#x27;s sensual and not over-bearing. It used to be sold at Macy&#x27;s and a few other stores but not it&#x27;s only sold by the manufacturer, Frances Denney. You can&#x27;t get better than this!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, good service.</li>
    <li> I have been searching stores for years to find my favorite cologne.  Something told me to google it.  Yes, yes, yes, I found it and yes I order it. I cannot wait for the arrival.  I always got good compliments on my smell.  It stayed on my clothes, body, hair and every where. I start using Interlude in 1959 in high school.  I use to buy it from Hecht&#x27;s Department store who has now become Macy&#x27;s and they do not carry Interlude. I am so happy.</li>
    <li> Ladies (or whatever you prefer to be called these days), take it from a man -- this is the absolute best and most effective fragrance ever concocted in the witch&#x27;s lair.  Simply put, dab a bit of this in the usual places and you&#x27;ll be able to get any man to do anything you want, right now.  He&#x27;ll simply be unable to control himself.  Eventually he&#x27;ll learn to not even try.  In a way Interlude should be outlawed under one of the chemical warfare treaties, it&#x27;s that powerful.  Well, don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned.  :)</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance that has been around for awhile.  I have worn this fragrance for 40 years and I still get complements that \\&quot;you smell so good!\\&quot;  It is very hard to find in stores.  This is a light fragrance, musky, not too sweet.  I get headaches from a lot of fragrances -- not this one.</li>
    <li> i told all my family about it</li>
    <li> This product is one of my favorites, since it&#x27;s and older product it&#x27;s hard to find, I love the scent and have been complimented many times by strangers. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 45 years!  When a male friend hugs you and says &amp;#34;Wow you smell good!&amp;#34; you know you have a winner!</li>
