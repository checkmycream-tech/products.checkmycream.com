<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using eb5 for about 20 years.  Don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging claim, but the cream keeps my skin moist.  This time the 2-ounce size was the best price.</li>
    <li> Fine stuff  .. Leaves skin soft and smooth..&lt;br /&gt;Have used for thirty years or more ...</li>
    <li> I am having a problem with the Facial Cream.  It is breaking out my skin and making it very leathery and dry  -  not at all Moisturing it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy with the product.  I have very sensitive skin and this is not working for me.  I needed moisture not dryness.&lt;br /&gt;What can  I do to resolve this, I can send it back and I request a Credit to my account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please respond.</li>
    <li> all 2 ounces of eb5 containers were not completely full,it looked as thoughsome cream had been taken from the containers. The cream was to expensive, the price was higher this time with less cream. very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> This Eb5 cream was originally given to me as a gift, and I was appreciative. The I started to use it, and discovered that I noticed some positive changes in my facial skin. I am a 59 year young woman, and have the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth that naturally occur with age. I have always just washed my face with water; used no makeup except mascara; and used Vaseline Intensive Care lotion on my face daily. I figured I would be looking like I am for the rest of my life, but perhaps more wrinkly. But after using Eb5 cream for only a couple days, I noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes smoothed out and were not so noticeable. And the creases around my mouth smoothed out as well.&lt;br /&gt;Well, needless to say, I&#x27;ve been using the cream now for about two years, and will not use anything else. I&#x27;m convinced.</li>
    <li> The 2 oz of EB5 that I received I am NOT happy with as it is very gritty.  The 4 oz. was was fine and nice and creamy as it is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Yes, product meet our needs. Have purchased before. Thought we were getting a great deal at this price for a 4 oz. jar. but this was only 2. Not your fault but us. Product is still great.</li>
    <li> This the second jar of ebb I&#x27;ve ordered.  I does feel great on your skin.  I have rosacea and this stuff calms that down to the point it is hard to see.</li>
    <li> EB5 is a nice light facial lotion that is easily absorbed by the skin. This site is the only place that I know of where it may be ordered.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find it until I ran across it on Amazon.  Have missed using it and once again, it does wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and would not do without EB5&lt;br /&gt;even on trips I take in small containers</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. I use to buy it at jcPenney. Great stuff. use it at nite and in the morning</li>
    <li> I have used this cream since it first became available on the market.  It is just the right consistency for a night cream as well as a daily moisturizer.  People comment on my fairly wrinkle free face and I am 81 years old.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20yrs. I love it. I&#x27;m 51 yrs old and my skin is in really good health. My grandmother used this product and even at 90 when she passed away she had beautiful skin. I would highly recommend this product! I use to have to buy it at J.C. Penny&#x27;s but they do not carry it anymore.  I&#x27;m glad I can buy it online now.</li>
    <li> I like this cream.  It is very hydrating.  I have not really noticed a &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; in my skin, but it does feel good.</li>
    <li> I have the typical wrinkle cream graveyard in my drawer but believe I have found  something that works well. Short of plastic surgery, which I would never do, no one iis going to lose all their wrinkles but eb5 has quickly given me,in less than a month the smoothest look my face has ever had in recent years. I&#x27;m 64 and use it religiously every night. In the morning after applying my makeup I can truly tell the difference .</li>
    <li> I consider eb5 Facial Cream an excellent product.  I have used it for a few years.  It leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Quick Delivery and Excellent Product, Very Pleased.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years and still love it. You do not have to use much at one time so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> eb5 is best product I have ever used</li>
    <li> First tried this product w/free samples (facial cream).  It&#x27;s about the same price as comparable Avon products so thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Love the fact it&#x27;s unscented and is really moisturizing without being greasy.  Will definitely continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it really does work. I am always getting nice remarks on how beautiful and young my skin looks. I would recommend this product because it is great!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and am told by many that I look years younger than I am.  I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> Incredible product! Leaves skin smooth and refreshed. My 85 year old client recommended this product to me since I was so amazed with her beautiful skin! I&#x27;m so impressed with this anti-aging product!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream...I have been using this cream for many years. It goes on smooth and keeps your face moist without any greasy residue. I will continue to use eb5 products.</li>
    <li> My wife have used this product for a long time and work for her without any allergic reaction. It is the only product that suites her</li>
    <li> Not a great fan as it is very thick and heavy.My face also broke out with pimples</li>
    <li> I love this product and I have been using it for years and years. My skin feels soft and not greasy. Many people think that i am 10-15 years younger than I am.</li>
    <li> good price as advertised</li>
    <li> I have used the EB5 products for over 6 years and totally satisfied with the results of the daily usage.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I use this consistently. The local store where I used to purchase it remodeled and quit carrying it. I like the product quite well and apprecite the convenience of ordering it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, love it.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this face cream for over 10 years. It is heavy without being greasy. It does not have fragrance which really helps me since I am very allergic to perfumes. I use it in the morning as my foundation before applying my makeup.  It gives my face a soft look without a powder.  I love it</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 30 years.  I am almost 70 and have good skin for an old lady.  I honestly think that has to do with the EB5 that I have used for so long.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Most moisturizers make my face break out, but this cream is wonderful.  It softens and protects.  Also I have bad allergies and some creams will make my eyes water but this feels natural.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  My 90 year old Mother has used it for years and she has beautiful skin.  It is very hard to find the cream, walgreens used to carry it, but now has trouble getting it in, so when I found it on line I was thrilled!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Eb5 Facial Cream is a product I have been using for about 5 years. It is simply a great product. My skin is sensitive yet this product has never caused any irritation whatsoever--even when I apply it close to (or on) the skin around my eyes. It is not greasy, has no fragrance and it keeps my skin hydrated and feeling great. I used to rely on other products that I thought I&#x27;d never give up--this was until I tried the eb5 facial cream. I have never returned to any of the previously used facial creams. I highly recommend this product and will continue to unless for some reason the formula is altered or changed. But this is something unlikely to occur. The price may seem high but a little goes a long way and the results are worth it. A great product--try it.</li>
    <li> Have used this cream on my face for about twenty years and love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> recommended by a friend, it has my skin soft and not dry looking.  72 year old grandmother.  Second jar gave as a gift to my&lt;br /&gt;50 year old daughter who is ready to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I would never use oil of olay again after using this for it it just what the &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; needed to STOP</li>
    <li> WOW!  It was so much more than I expected.  The cream is thick but &amp;#34;a little dab with do ya&amp;#34;!  I love how my skin just drinks up the moisturizing cream - especially if you leave a tinge of water on your face.  The cream is a great emollient for my dry skin.  My husband also uses it.  It makes our skin look and feel better.  I would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This was false advertising! I used both products &amp; it does NOT remove age spots. Call me a sucker!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for your face!!&lt;br /&gt;It is just a good product and would recommend to everyone that uses a face cream.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it, other than it just doesn&#x27;t help my skin.  Everyone has different types of skin.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do really like is that it is fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> Mom used it for years and had beautiful skin, i am a repeat performance!</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy but works well. It is not greasy and very gentle on the skin. No miracles but my favorite so far and I&#x27;ve tried several other brands.</li>
    <li> Got it for mom.  She has been using it for over 30 years.  I guess she likes it.</li>
    <li> Really like using this cream especially dealing with such dry weather but I wish you got more for the money.  It&#x27;s expensive but overall worth it.</li>
    <li> Love the cream, and was very impressed with the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I say okay, because its like any other face cream you buy at a local store.  I saw no results or difference in my skin after weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 10 years.  I&#x27;m 61 years old and it works</li>
    <li> To me it works good like a cold cream &amp; that&#x27;s about all I can say about it other then I think there are products just as good that are less expensive. I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin so I probably won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> I use this product with hope that it will keep my wrinkles down to a minimum.  I am 50 years old, and have began to get crows feet and a few wrinkles around my mouth.  Hopefully this will not increase the elasticity, and will minimize the wrinkles I have now.  I use it also because I have sensitive skin, and this product does not cause an allergic reaction to my skin.  Okay.  laterz</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used eb5 more years than I remember.  I still love it and never without it.</li>
    <li> Heard a lot about this cream, but when I received it I didn&#x27;t know it had so many harmful chemicals in it and did not bother to even try it!&lt;br /&gt;Sent this back with no hassle and also had gotten a prompt refund.</li>
    <li> I used a nice quality skin care line for 5 years and was pretty happy with it. I saw an ad in a magazine for EB5 and thought I would try this product after doing some research and reading reviews. In the last 2 months of using this cream my facial wrinkles have diminshed more in this time then in the last 5 years! Pretty awesome. Just ordering the skin cleanser now. Can&#x27;t wait to try that!</li>
    <li> My aunt in Puerto Rico has used product for a few years and highly recommended it.  I was skeptical as I have sensitive skin and most facial products tend to irritate my skin.  Had to immediately wash my face when I used the product.  It stung and made my face red.  I gave the cream to my 82 year old mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I liked this a bit but if felt like a dry moisturizer.  It just doesn&#x27;t have enough moisture for my face and then I started to break out so I had to stop using this.  Just not for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have use this on and off for years. I truely like how it makes my skin soft and heips with the signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;It gets a A+ from this reviewer. I really like this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now and I have not seen any differents I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer it&#x27;s not too greasy and makes my skin look better. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years morning and night.  I find it not to be greasy as some moisturizers.</li>
    <li> So far so good, the cream does make my face feel great and not greasy; I pray that this cream will be an alternative to those wildley expensive creams.</li>
    <li> Best facial cream out there, for me!!  LOVE it!!!!  I have been using this for years!!!!!</li>
    <li> For some reason the product seems old...not quite as &#x27;creamy&#x27; as some I bought a while ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using eb5 for several years and at 72 I think it works.  Bought this one as a gift.</li>
    <li> It was ok, but nothing special.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it, thats why I orderred it for myself and my best friend. She&#x27;s never used it before and loves it too.</li>
    <li> Having age 40 combination skin, I was a bit nervous after reading reviews stating this cream is greasy.  I was very pleasantly surprised to the contrary in my case.  It gives my skin perfect moisture and absorbs completely without a heavy oily residue.  Furthermore, I have found that for the first time in many years (and after many antiaging products), my skin now looks more even toned, has a healthy glow, and my wrinkles are dramatically softened.  I have found my one and only antiaging moisturizer.  I guess my grandma did know best.</li>
    <li> I have been using the eb5 products for about three years and will never be without them.  I am 58 years old with extremely dry skin which does not slough off without help.  I use this cream day and night and it delivers beautiful, radiant skin.  Because my skin is so dry, I do use an additional moisturizer with it during the day.  I&#x27;ve never used this without the toner, so would have to recommend it also.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the EB5 facial cream produced absolutely no positive results. Perhaps, considering the fact that my age is over 70 which could be a factor that caused the unfavorable results, since according to other reviews it has been beneficial to some people. However, from my perspective I am unable to recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
    <li> used this cream for many years and glad I found it back. was used to buy it at JC Penny&amp;#34;s, but live abroad so have to order it.</li>
