      <li>and they mostly stay in place now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased, all of them are adorable.  </li>
      <li>There are so many</li>
      <li>Have not gotten to use them yet, however they are really cute and can&#x27;t wait to put them on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok because they don&#x27;t stick on that well and some of the animals it showed on the picture were not in the shipment.</li>
      <li>It does take a while to arrive, but that it okay with me.  </li>
      <li>adorable and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>These fimo slices are easy to use in manicures, cardmaking, polymer clay projects and jewelry.  </li>
      <li>Easily snag hair.</li>
      <li>The animals are super cute.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll have fun</li>
      <li>These were not exactly as pictures, but still a very good bargain for the price and cost of shipping.  </li>
      <li>I am so excited to use them.  </li>
      <li>So adorable, very well detailed.</li>
      <li>, right?!)</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be better off purchasing whole fimo canes instead.</li>
      <li>great...came quickly...</li>
      <li>I loved these cute little cut-outs!</li>
      <li>Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
      <li>These are pretty and unique, however, the negatives outweigh the positive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure to come up with more ideas for these little bits of fun.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much detail is in something that tiny!</li>
      <li>FIrstly, the designs were nothing close to the ones pictured.</li>
      <li>thanks!  </li>
      <li>The static cling makes them stick to the \\&quot;wheel\\&quot; part and get plopped over into the next compartment.</li>
      <li>For the price it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but I ordered the one with a cat and NOTHING yellow and in bright colors.</li>
      <li>thing is that some of these were shredded by the cheap, flimsy wheel part and arrived all mixed up in the compartments.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>So far they seem to stay on very well with just a drop of nail glue.</li>
      <li>That way you know what ur getting (depending if its listed) and are able to make the slices yourself, as to avoid chips and slices missing.</li>
      <li>There is a cheap looking replica of Minnie Mouse, a Chinese looking cat (like you would see at a Chinese restaurant)</li>
      <li>For the small amount you pay you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>I love the different looks you can get with these little faces.</li>
      <li>But the item was cheap, and I did like a few of the animals.</li>
      <li>I know they didn&#x27;t cost much thank god, but I will trash these there is actually nothing that is useable.</li>
      <li>Kind of irritating because it took a month to get here</li>
      <li>Good deal on something that&#x27;s usually expensive in my part of the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Got the order a while back, they came after a short time and exactly as what described.</li>
      <li>, the others were chipped or not there due to the packaging being broken (must have fallen during shipping, im guessing.)It seems like a good deal but save ur money.</li>
      <li>These little things are right on.</li>
      <li>Disappointed because I have ordered several of these different styles and nail stuff but have never encountered this before I was happy with everything else I ordered.</li>

<li> only at least 20 or so usable pieces in the whole thing</li>
<li> Easy to use and remove, no need to go to an expensive salon when you can do it yourself with these.  </li>
<li> I got yellow, pink and blue animals!</li>
<li> They did take a little long to get here, but look how far its coming from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> suggest getting the little wax-tip pencil made for picking up tiny things like this.</li>
<li> They come in a little tiny wheel</li>
<li> Hard to mold to curve of fingernails (I found soaking them in water prior to application helps with the thinner slices).</li>
<li> I like all the choices that come in one little reel.</li>
<li> They are very small and thin so they are difficult to work with, but worth the money.</li>
<li> Hard little things to get hold of.</li>
<li> Not sure if that&#x27;s meant to come with the order or not</li>
<li> There is not 144 pieces and a lot of them are broken, but you get what you pay for.</li>
<li> Difficult to use...just buy the stickers!</li>
<li> I had some stupid Angry Bird things that I&#x27;m never going to use.</li>
<li> but some were so horrible looking</li>
<li> Horrible customer service.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price, and lots of fun for the kids and I to play with. We love doing our nails together so this was an excellent way to throw in some variety.</li>
    <li> adorable and easy to use.  Can make cute designs that are eye-catching and stylish.  I love the different looks you can get with these little faces.</li>
    <li> They look just like the picture! I also got the order in 2 weeks! They are very tiny, I would recommend using tweezers to grab them out of the wheel.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. Very bright colors, they are fairly easy to use as well. My daughters love them, thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting to receive what was shown, and that was not the case at all. FIrstly, the designs were nothing close to the ones pictured. Second, I received a severely damaged container that looked like someone literally stomped on it and shipped it! there were only at least 20 or so usable pieces in the whole thing, the others were chipped or not there due to the packaging being broken (must have fallen during shipping, im guessing.)It seems like a good deal but save ur money. You&#x27;d be better off purchasing whole fimo canes instead. That way you know what ur getting (depending if its listed) and are able to make the slices yourself, as to avoid chips and slices missing. Also, I contacted the seller, sent the photo they requested of this item (i know, considering the low price, right?!) and nver received a response after that. Horrible customer service.</li>
    <li> So adorable, very well detailed. Easy to use and remove, no need to go to an expensive salon when you can do it yourself with these.  There are so many it&#x27;s really a great deal!</li>
    <li> These fimo slices are easy to use in manicures, cardmaking, polymer clay projects and jewelry.  I&#x27;m sure to come up with more ideas for these little bits of fun.</li>
    <li> These little things are right on. The girlfriend likes me to pick them up for her when I can so I got some for her Christmas stocking. She looked inside each compartment one by one and commented on each of the pieces. Good deal on something that&#x27;s usually expensive in my part of the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that some of these were shredded by the cheap, flimsy wheel part and arrived all mixed up in the compartments. I dumped them out and started over and they mostly stay in place now. The static cling makes them stick to the \\&quot;wheel\\&quot; part and get plopped over into the next compartment. Still, I&#x27;d buy them again because they&#x27;re cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the picture as of now shows tweezers and glue both individually and in the group photo. Not sure if that&#x27;s meant to come with the order or not but it doesn&#x27;t. The item description doesn&#x27;t list it but the photos would make someone think they were going to get everything that&#x27;s pictured.</li>
    <li> Have not gotten to use them yet, however they are really cute and can&#x27;t wait to put them on. Bought for daughter to use.</li>
    <li> Animals in picture are not what you get. I had some stupid Angry Bird things that I&#x27;m never going to use. When I received the item, it did not look like 144 pieces either. But the item was cheap, and I did like a few of the animals.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok because they don&#x27;t stick on that well and some of the animals it showed on the picture were not in the shipment.</li>
    <li> The animals are super cute. They are very small and thin so they are difficult to work with, but worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are pretty and unique, however, the negatives outweigh the positive. Each piece seems to be a different width. Easily snag hair. Hard to mold to curve of fingernails (I found soaking them in water prior to application helps with the thinner slices). Difficult to use...just buy the stickers!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with the animals that are in the picture and it didn&#x27;t come with the glue or tweezers. There is not 144 pieces and a lot of them are broken, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These were not exactly as pictures, but still a very good bargain for the price and cost of shipping.  It does take a while to arrive, but that it okay with me.  Will add these to my growing collection of nail art decorations.</li>
    <li> Got the order a while back, they came after a short time and exactly as what described. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll have fun decorate our nails with this.Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love fimo fruit, fimo animals, everything fimo for my nail art :)  These are great, although I couldn&#x27;t tell what all of them were.</li>
    <li> Huge hit with my girls! Make sure you get the tweezers! Hard little things to get hold of. So far they seem to stay on very well with just a drop of nail glue.</li>
    <li> love them!  thanks!  I am so excited to use them.  I like all the choices that come in one little reel.</li>
    <li> They come in a little tiny wheel but well work the price I paid for them. I love using them and there are so many to choose from.I would buy them again!</li>
    <li> One of the animals I received looks like a chocobo from Final Fantasy.  I&#x27;m quite pleased, all of them are adorable.  It&#x27;s amazing how much detail is in something that tiny!</li>
    <li> I loved these cute little cut-outs! Of course I loved more than others but it&#x27;s a great price for all these cute things.</li>
    <li> you DON&#x27;T get what is pictured. Kind of irritating because it took a month to get here and you don&#x27;t get what you ordered! For the price it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but I ordered the one with a cat and NOTHING yellow and in bright colors. I got yellow, pink and blue animals! Still cute, but not what was pictured.</li>
    <li> I too received something that was NOTHING as pictured. I would not use ANY of these.  There is a cheap looking replica of Minnie Mouse, a Chinese looking cat (like you would see at a Chinese restaurant) but some were so horrible looking I can&#x27;t even tell what the heck they are. I know they didn&#x27;t cost much thank god, but I will trash these there is actually nothing that is useable. Disappointed because I have ordered several of these different styles and nail stuff but have never encountered this before I was happy with everything else I ordered.</li>
    <li> cute...an very tiny. I am using them in my craft for my jewelry worked out great...came quickly...would like to see more animals</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and the quality is great and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also! Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
    <li> These films slices were smaller than I was expecting so I gave them to the grade-school girls next door. They loved them. For the small amount you pay you can&#x27;t ask for more. It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> These are nice quality, very pretty and a great price. They did take a little long to get here, but look how far its coming from.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest getting the little wax-tip pencil made for picking up tiny things like this. It works great and leaves no residue or sticky spots on the teeny stars and stuff.</li>
