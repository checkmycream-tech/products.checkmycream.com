### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Customer service has been the best.</li>
      <li>It took me a while to get it perfect</li>
      <li>An excellent product, a great company!!!</li>
      <li>My best guess is that it works between 16 to 20 hours.</li>
      <li>This is incredible.</li>
      <li>i will be always a great customer .</li>
      <li>SO HAPPY.</li>
      <li>and I am happy I did.</li>
      <li>When I purchased Dermaflage I requested the Fair shade.</li>
      <li>&amp; I love it!</li>
      <li>This was AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING..</li>
      <li>So when this product dries it is honestly like cement.</li>
      <li>but the dispensers get plugged up very easily and the product will not come out when you squeeze it.</li>
      <li>I ordered a fair kit but one of the two silicone fillers was light, which did not match my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I have tried many things to cover it</li>
      <li>After years of looking for a cover up product, I am so glad I found dermaflage.</li>
      <li>This in itself is not horrible - better to have the scars covered than have holes in my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The results are okay.</li>
      <li>but I must say, I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>But I so glad I did not give up.</li>
      <li>Definitely satisfied.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s awesome &amp; the customer service on the actual site</li>
      <li>And it is waterproof because I cried when I saw how well it worked :)</li>
      <li>It was not that easy to apply, I have tried many times, but this made my skin inflamed.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 more of the Fair tone from the product web site directly - but it just does not work as advertised.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, first of all the company is very easy to deal with.</li>
      <li>and now it seems too light.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, the offered skin matches do not exactly match my skin tone, which is very fair.  </li>
      <li>And yes - my skin is clean when I put it on</li>
      <li>I bought this in hopes of covering up my shameful scars and so far I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>When I e-mailed them to ask them for the second &#x27;fair&#x27; shade, since this is what I ordered, they refused to send it.</li>
      <li>is great too very helpful &amp; they respond quickly, this would be my third time repurchasing</li>
      <li>Was excited to try this product, as it seemed to be exactly what I needed - to just cover my scars cosmetically.  </li>
      <li>This is such an AMAZING product.</li>
      <li>Probably worth about $10-15.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit, being a guy and never having any prior experience applying makeup of any kind</li>
      <li>I got fairly good results applying it directly to my fingertips and applying it directly to the scar.  </li>
      <li>Really really worth it</li>
      <li>I love how natural it looks and feels.</li>
      <li>It looks natural and is quick and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>the one you requested isn&#x27;t the right one.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>It only lasted about 7-8 hours before it started to lift around the edges, which also looks.....odd, and rather embarrassing if you aren&#x27;t used to looking in the mirror periodically to make sure it&#x27;s still staying on well.</li>
      <li>I finally got some fairly good results with the second syringe.</li>
      <li>you are someone with sensitive skin, or someone who cares about what kind of chemicals are put on their body (especially face) do not get this</li>
      <li>:) and some minor scarring that occurred was gone too!  </li>
      <li>A far as it making my frown lines less noticeable, I would say that it works fairly well.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind: this product costs a LOT, and the syringes go fast.  </li>
      <li>thank you sooo much</li>
      <li>Stays on the whole day.  </li>
      <li>but nothing, absolutely nothing, came close to dermaflage.  </li>
      <li>For me, the key is applying enough primer to the area, and making sure not to put too much of the product on (less is more!).</li>
      <li>I have tried many other products in an effort to deal with my problem, and nothing worked like I needed.</li>
      <li>My scars meet the criteria for this product, and I am not dumb</li>
      <li>I just wish this product had more honest reviews, would save customers a lot of money and disappointment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She don&#x27;t have much scars, but she had a few, so we don&#x27;t know how this works for much, but for few it&#x27;s a great tool.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I choose medium and this color was fine until I spent time in the sun</li>
      <li>This product has changed my life for the better and at this point I&#x27;m not sure I could live without it!.</li>
      <li>So every time you apply the product you have to use the new dispenser.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m careful, I can easily get the filler to last 2-3 days on my face by gently washing around the areas that have the Dermaflage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I apply the primer on the scar and the surrounding area and wait 30 seconds, I use a tiny amount (enough to just fill the holes), smooth the edges with my finger, and keep the pad on the area until the product is hardened in the mixing</li>
      <li>And looks natural!  </li>
      <li>:) The first time i tried to use it, i was having a little problem but with enough practice everything became as simple as i could think of.</li>
      <li>problem I have is that the product is advertised as lasting &amp;#34;up to 36 hours&amp;#34; when it barely lasts 8 hours before beginning to lift and fray at the edges, making the fact that I have something covering the scars much more obvious, even gross.  </li>
      <li>Let me be clear...</li>
      <li>My situation has done a complete 180.</li>
      <li>Wow, the breakthrough technology to cover imperfections and major scars at home giving you the confidence you&#x27;ve missed for years.  </li>
      <li>For example, Last month , i had an issue with a recent order because demflage was more oily than usual, so i called the customer service</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, for me personally, the cons far outweigh the pros.</li>
      <li>could see this not working as well for shallow, rolling type scars, but if you have icepicks it really works wonders, just be prepared to practice a little until you get it right!!</li>

<li> When the product finally dries (it took several hours 2-3 to fully dry, and no I wasn&#x27;t using too much or applying it in layers), when you move your face (smiling, raising your eyebrows as you would in everyday facial expressions, the silicone will wrinkle around the area and look rather odd.</li>
<li> I tried the clear silicone was a mess!  </li>
<li> I have a pitted chicken pox scar right in the middle of my forehead</li>
<li> scars are mostly small icepick marks from prior acne on my cheeks.</li>
<li> Choosing the right color is a little difficult.  </li>
<li> However,  at least for me I would not say it last 36 hours.  </li>
<li> with a few tries, this product DOES work.&lt;br</li>
<li> I suspect that the mixing tips are actually the secret for filling in scars, which they don&#x27;t include in your first package that you buy; they are another $30 which is absurd for a few plastic tips.</li>

<li> I used to have severe acne problems as a teenager, and sometimes I feel awkward in public due to the the scars that the the acne has left over.</li>
<li> I feel I have my life back, well at least my eyes!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using dermaflage for a little over 2 years now</li>
<li> Took a little time to practice</li>
<li> , I was extremely skeptical and worried it would look natural, but after a few tries I really got the hang of applying this, and now it&#x27;s nearly impossible to notice in any type of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> 50 dollars down the drain!</li>
<li> I was using this on my cheeks to hide a few indentation scars.</li>
<li> /&gt;We can recommend if you have few scars, this will do its job.</li>
<li> It also dries too fast and it is very difficult to apply.</li>
<li> So for practice I used the entire syringe of the wrong shade.</li>

<li> I wish it&#x27;d be less expensive</li>
<li> I truly hate it, using this has completely restored my confidence.</li>
<li> All throughout high school I had HORRIBLE acne, I used to scratch at it</li>
<li> Also when it dries on your skin it is difficult to take off</li>
<li> Very frustrating.</li>
<li> contacted the product&#x27;s customer service rep about my disappointment, they just repeated the steps to apply it correctly, as if I hadn&#x27;t already.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very expensive for what it is.</li>
<li> This covers everything and is nearly impossible to notice my skin problems from a distance.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It took me a while to get it perfect but I must say, I absolutely love this product.  I have had surgery because of an accident years ago and it left an indented scar that has always made me feel insecure.  I have tried many things to cover it but nothing, absolutely nothing, came close to dermaflage.  I love how natural it looks and feels. Stays on the whole day.  I never have to worry about it peeling off.  After years of looking for a cover up product, I am so glad I found dermaflage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using dermaflage for a little over 2 years now &amp; I love it! I have a pitted chicken pox scar right in the middle of my forehead I&#x27;ve gone years just using my hair to cover it, thankfully I found this product &amp; it works wonders! It takes some time to get it right but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s awesome &amp; the customer service on the actual site is great too very helpful &amp; they respond quickly, this would be my third time repurchasing</li>
    <li> I have 2 recessed small scars from having moles removed.  Was excited to try this product, as it seemed to be exactly what I needed - to just cover my scars cosmetically.  My scars meet the criteria for this product, and I am not dumb - I applied tiny amounts and used the product as instructed.  However, after trying repeatedly to blend it and work with it, II ran out of my starter sample and also had inflamed skin from trying over and over again.  I ordered 2 more of the Fair tone from the product web site directly - but it just does not work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the offered skin matches do not exactly match my skin tone, which is very fair.  It is obvious that there is some makeup or coverup on my scars.  This in itself is not horrible - better to have the scars covered than have holes in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is that the product is advertised as lasting &amp;#34;up to 36 hours&amp;#34; when it barely lasts 8 hours before beginning to lift and fray at the edges, making the fact that I have something covering the scars much more obvious, even gross.  Keep in mind: this product costs a LOT, and the syringes go fast.  And yes - my skin is clean when I put it on, I apply the primer on the scar and the surrounding area and wait 30 seconds, I use a tiny amount (enough to just fill the holes), smooth the edges with my finger, and keep the pad on the area until the product is hardened in the mixing dish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the product&#x27;s customer service rep about my disappointment, they just repeated the steps to apply it correctly, as if I hadn&#x27;t already.  It IS a bit of a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to go to my dermatologist, get Juvaderm filler instead.  I just wish this product had more honest reviews, would save customers a lot of money and disappointment.</li>
    <li> This is incredible. I wish it&#x27;d be less expensive so I could use on a daily routine. Really really worth it it hides my scars on the forehead. SO HAPPY. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had started to give up on finding anything that could help me with my scars. I gave Dermaflage a chance and I am happy I did. I have tried many other products in an effort to deal with my problem, and nothing worked like I needed. My situation has done a complete 180. Definitely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Choosing the right color is a little difficult.  I choose medium and this color was fine until I spent time in the sun and now it seems too light.  Possibly no one else notices but I notice the silicon on my skin after my skin tanned some.  A far as it making my frown lines less noticeable, I would say that it works fairly well.  However,  at least for me I would not say it last 36 hours.  My best guess is that it works between 16 to 20 hours.</li>
    <li> I bought this product last year but it did not work.  The silicone looked worst than the scar. It also dries too fast and it is very difficult to apply. I spent like 3 applicator to cover one small scar. I did return it and the company reimbursed my money.</li>
    <li> I used to have severe acne problems as a teenager, and sometimes I feel awkward in public due to the the scars that the the acne has left over. This however has made it easier to leave home without the looks I may receive. This covers everything and is nearly impossible to notice my skin problems from a distance. Helps me and my skin blend in!</li>
    <li> I want to thank this company for allowing me to go out without glasses on which I have been hiding behind after having horrible scarring under my eyes!  Took a little time to practice but I can go out without my glasses on!  I feel I can take a picture with my family!  This is such an AMAZING product. Even if you have a pox mark, it&#x27;s gone it seconds!  And looks natural!  But, the scars I have are severe and NOTHING helped, tI was afraid to spend the money and TRY and HOPE it worked! IT WORKED!  Thank you, thank you, thank you sooo much I feel I have my life back, well at least my eyes! :) and some minor scarring that occurred was gone too!  If you have scarring and feel embarrassed and nothing helps try this!  I tried the clear silicone was a mess!  This was AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING..I have suffered for 4 years with these scars and finally something that helped me!....And it is waterproof because I cried when I saw how well it worked :)</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life for the better and at this point I&#x27;m not sure I could live without it!. I&#x27;ll admit, being a guy and never having any prior experience applying makeup of any kind, I was extremely skeptical and worried it would look natural, but after a few tries I really got the hang of applying this, and now it&#x27;s nearly impossible to notice in any type of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scars are mostly small icepick marks from prior acne on my cheeks. For me, the key is applying enough primer to the area, and making sure not to put too much of the product on (less is more!). If I&#x27;m careful, I can easily get the filler to last 2-3 days on my face by gently washing around the areas that have the Dermaflage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see this not working as well for shallow, rolling type scars, but if you have icepicks it really works wonders, just be prepared to practice a little until you get it right!!</li>
    <li> I ordered a fair kit but one of the two silicone fillers was light, which did not match my skin tone. It was not that easy to apply, I have tried many times, but this made my skin inflamed. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> All throughout high school I had HORRIBLE acne, I used to scratch at it and well now I regret it. I bought this in hopes of covering up my shameful scars and so far I LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve always been very insecure about the way my face looks, I hate it. I truly hate it, using this has completely restored my confidence. It looks natural and is quick and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Had issues. So, first of all the company is very easy to deal with. However I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but the dispensers get plugged up very easily and the product will not come out when you squeeze it. Very frustrating. So when this product dries it is honestly like cement. So every time you apply the product you have to use the new dispenser. Also when it dries on your skin it is difficult to take off and I worry that I&#x27;m taking off skin.</li>
    <li> I have a hole on my cheek do to an infection.&lt;br /&gt;It took a few tries to get it right. But I so glad I did not give up. I don&#x27;t have to change it every&lt;br /&gt;Other day, sometimes longer. So thank you Dermaflage.</li>
    <li> When I purchased Dermaflage I requested the Fair shade. They send you two different shades just in case the one you requested isn&#x27;t the right one. When I e-mailed them to ask them for the second &#x27;fair&#x27; shade, since this is what I ordered, they refused to send it. So for practice I used the entire syringe of the wrong shade. I finally got some fairly good results with the second syringe. I suspect that the mixing tips are actually the secret for filling in scars, which they don&#x27;t include in your first package that you buy; they are another $30 which is absurd for a few plastic tips. It does help in the application process if you refrigerate the syringe for 5 minutes or so prior to applying. The results are okay. I got fairly good results applying it directly to my fingertips and applying it directly to the scar.  When the product finally dries (it took several hours 2-3 to fully dry, and no I wasn&#x27;t using too much or applying it in layers), when you move your face (smiling, raising your eyebrows as you would in everyday facial expressions, the silicone will wrinkle around the area and look rather odd. It only lasted about 7-8 hours before it started to lift around the edges, which also looks.....odd, and rather embarrassing if you aren&#x27;t used to looking in the mirror periodically to make sure it&#x27;s still staying on well. Overall, I think that the product shows some promise, but needs A LOT of work on the company&#x27;s end. It&#x27;s very expensive for what it is. Probably worth about $10-15.</li>
    <li> #dermaflage.  Wow, the breakthrough technology to cover imperfections and major scars at home giving you the confidence you&#x27;ve missed for years.  Lasts up to two days if necessary.  Thank you dermaflage</li>
    <li> Totally changed my life . :) The first time i tried to use it, i was having a little problem but with enough practice everything became as simple as i could think of. Customer service has been the best. Dermaflage staffs are always looking forward to hear to your feed back so they can improve the product.  For example, Last month , i had an issue with a recent order because demflage was more oily than usual, so i called the customer service and they were so cooperative to listen to me and they promised me they will fix this problem. Thank you guys. i will be always a great customer .</li>
    <li> An excellent product, a great company!!!</li>
    <li> My wife just bought this tool for herself, and she said it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;She don&#x27;t have much scars, but she had a few, so we don&#x27;t know how this works for much, but for few it&#x27;s a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;We can recommend if you have few scars, this will do its job.</li>
    <li> Let me be clear...with a few tries, this product DOES work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for me personally, the cons far outweigh the pros. I was using this on my cheeks to hide a few indentation scars. While I did notice a difference in the scars, I broke out in a horrible rash/acne reaction literally an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone with sensitive skin, or someone who cares about what kind of chemicals are put on their body (especially face) do not get this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this was seriously expensive to simply have not been able to use. 50 dollars down the drain!</li>
