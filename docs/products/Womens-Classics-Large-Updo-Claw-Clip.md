<li> Its flat</li>
<li> love these, crazy they have to be ordered and not in stores</li>
<li> I would recommend this product to anyone with medium to long hair.&lt;br /&gt;The seller of this product was prompt; I will do business with them again if the opportunity presents itself.</li>
<li> She prefers this type of clip due to the comfort of the curved back</li>
<li> Goody is a little more expensive than other clips, but you get what you pay for!</li>
<li> These are literally the ONLY clips that work in my long thick hair.  </li>
<li> I have very long, thick blonde hair.</li>
<li> I have fairly thick curly hair, about back bra strap length.</li>
<li> One of the clips ( the middle one in the package) was completely broken</li>
<li> If you have hard to hold, thick, or long hair, these are for you.</li>
<li> so if I am driving or on a chair with a head rest, it&#x27;s as uncomfortable as other clips that hold less hair.</li>
<li> I have a hard time finding clips that will hold my hair for any length of time without falling out.</li>
<li> Every one of the clips I ordered has broken.</li>

    <li> They were bigger than I thought, but I plan on gifting.</li>
    <li> These are literally the ONLY clips that work in my long thick hair.  They&#x27;ve been discontinued I think, but I can&#x27;t imagine why.  I use them daily and they last (almost) forever.  After a year or so it seems they&#x27;ll lose a tooth, but the springs in them last and last.  Best hair clip ever. If you have hard to hold, thick, or long hair, these are for you.</li>
    <li> Love these claws wish I could get solid color packs</li>
    <li> I LOVE these clips and can only find them on Amazon! I swear I have about a dozen of them!</li>
    <li> My wife could not find these in the local stores. She prefers this type of clip due to the comfort of the curved back</li>
    <li> I have fairly thick curly hair, about back bra strap length. This is perfect to hold my hair up and off my neck and face. Its flat so if I am driving or on a chair with a head rest, it&#x27;s as uncomfortable as other clips that hold less hair. I ordered more to keep on hand.</li>

    <li> Love these clips, and they are difficult to find.</li>
    <li> These are the best hair clips ever!</li>
    <li> finally can put my hair up and not worry about boinking my head getting in and out of the car</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick blonde hair. I have a hard time finding clips that will hold my hair for any length of time without falling out.

    <li> I bought one of these clips years ago and I JUST LOVE IT.  During the summer Georgia is hot, hot, hot and I have hair just below my shoulders which I cannot stand to touch me in the heat.  As soon as I leave work up goes the hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone with medium to long hair.&lt;br /&gt;The seller of this product was prompt; I will do business with them again if the opportunity presents itself.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she was very pleased.</li>
    <li> These are the only clips that can hold my hair. I love them and have been using them for years. Glad you have them as I could not find them anymore. They do eventually break, so please continue to offer them.</li>
    <li> Love these, be careful not to drop the thin prongs break off.  Excellent job at holding up longer hair in an updo.  Love these claws wish they were made of a stronger, unbreakable material.</li>
    <li> love these, crazy they have to be ordered and not in stores</li>
    <li> I LOVE these claw clips but there was only ONE shipped to me. Ripoff!</li>
    <li> One of the clips ( the middle one in the package) was completely broken so I paid for three but really only got two</li>
