      <li>I am not a security blanket kind of girl</li>
      <li>It is a nice stress reliever.</li>
      <li>After I take it out of microwave, it doesn&#x27;t feel as warm until I rest it on my shoulders.</li>
      <li>so I decided I had to get my own.  </li>
      <li>Once I feel tension in my neck area, I just warm this pillow up and put it around my neck.</li>
      <li>It has a wet-heat when you heat it up which is nice.</li>
      <li>My mother has seen every kind of &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; health practitioner in an effort to resolve her chronic neck pain.  </li>

      <li>This fits the bill quite nicely.  </li>
      <li>Was a gift, the new Mom loved it!!!</li>
      <li>This arrived quickly and is great on my neck.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to heat up and use.</li>
      <li>great product, well worth the money.</li>
      <li>This product is even better with nice herbal smell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>heating beads were not stitched in place effectively, leading to most of the beads collecting at the ends of the pillow, and fewer up by my neck.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I get a stiff, tight neck from working long hours at a computer and over the counter painkillers only help a little. I saw this little pillow and thought it might help. Well, it does, a lot! The heat is moist and very soothing. The scent did not last through as many uses as I might have liked, but I do have essential oils on hand already so I can add the oils I like each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works. I use it a few times a day now, and sometimes when I&#x27;m going to bed as well. Sometimes it stays hot quite a while and other times it doesn&#x27;t seem to, although I haven&#x27;t worked out quite why. But it&#x27;s always helpful and I am definitely very glad I purchased it. Great find for people who have painfully tight neck muscles!</li>
    <li> I love this! Warm it up in the microwave for a little over a minute, and it&#x27;s good to go! It&#x27;s super relaxing! And the scent is awesome. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Product is a nice gift and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> My mother has seen every kind of &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; health practitioner in an effort to resolve her chronic neck pain.  However, the most consistent relief she has ever gotten has been from this heatable neck pillow!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use mine just about every day. It&#x27;s excellent quality and SMELLS AWESOME. I put mine in the microwave for a few seconds to make it warm, and it is comfortable, soft, and has a firm weight to it (not overly heavy). Great gift!</li>
    <li> it is very helpful when you come home from work or just working on your computer at home I use it</li>
    <li> TOO HEAVY ONCE YOU HAVE WORN IT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. MAKES YOUR NECK AND SHOULDERS HURT. I PERSONALLY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Very heavy around my neck.</li>
    <li> Warming collar works well and is high quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this neck pillow because I have been having soreness and stiffness in my neck and shoulders. Just like everyone else that has written a review, I put the pillow in the microwave for about 2 minutes (in 30 second intervals) and the heat sustains in the pillow for about 2 hours. I love that, even after it&#x27;s been in the microwave, the pillow&#x27;s filling sustains the heat (and even gets hotter) for a while. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot that it becomes uncomfortable, but I like that I don&#x27;t have to constantly reheat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pillow&#x27;s scent went away after the first or second use, but I didn&#x27;t factor that into my review because I honestly felt the scent was a bit overpowering. I&#x27;m happy to use it as a heated pillow without the scent, and I also use wrap it around my lower back. The carrying case comes in handy for me, as I&#x27;m constantly on the run and it&#x27;s a convenient way for me to always have it with me.</li>
    <li> Great product at very good price</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product so much in the past that I ordered two more. I have a pinched nerve and I use it to gain from relief from the pain.</li>
    <li> Have used it several times and think it helps the arthritis pain.</li>
    <li> I purchased this neck wrap for myself due to stress-related tension and neck and upper back stiffness. It smells great and heats up nicely. It&#x27;s almost too warm as it makes my neck pretty sweaty when I use it, but definitely does the trick of relaxing my neck and upper back muscles. The aromatherapy is very relaxing and puts me at ease.</li>
    <li> When heated, the pillow did provide some relief for my sore neck, but I was hoping for something fuller. The beads just kept falling to the ends and didn&#x27;t really stay on my neck.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent &amp; very nice for gifts or for personal use!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of neck problems and this greatly relieves my pain-this is my second purchase of this product-greatly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Stays flat. After microwaving per instructions it cooled down very quickly. Does not support your neck as claimed.  There is no support whatsoever. The smell is awful.  I do not usually complain but this is worth complaining about so others do not make the same mistake. And unfortunately I purchased one for me and one for my husband.  Our velour travel pillows are much more stable and helpful in attaining neck pain relief even without the warmth.  We will just stick to what we have.</li>
    <li> Purchased 3 of these as Christmas gifts, for 3 women. Two in early 20&#x27;s and one age 83. All of them were very please to receive and the younger ladies opened them up and tried them right away. The pillow is slightly smaller than I expected, but they were thrilled. The fragrance is Devine!  It is nice to have the convenient carry bag to store the pillow in as well, to protect from pet hair, etc.</li>
    <li> i love this warm, feels so good on your neck and shoulders! and the smell is very light of the lavender and chamomile...i just wish it was fuller and more head support like a regular neck pillow.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this for very long, but it is very soft, smells nice and is easy to nuke. My question is still: how long will it keep warm per use? Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> It came today and it&#x27;s just what I expected.  I love the fact that it came with a carrying case and that the cover is removable to wash.  Love the fragrance as well.  I feel it&#x27;s a good buy for the money.  It&#x27;s perfect for shoulder and neck pain either hot or cold.</li>
    <li> very heavy. Got headaches around my neck.</li>
    <li> I love his neck wrap. It fits just on one&#x27;s shoulders and sure helps relieve stress in neck and shoulders.</li>
    <li> This neck pillow feels fabulous on stiff, tense necks and shoulders. The first week I got it I used it nearly every night, it holds its heat very well if you are using it to drift off to sleep. The pillow liner is very soft and plush, while the weight is perfect and it feels like you are getting a very weak hug from a cuddly sloth. The smell is not overpowerful, a little more musty than I would like but mostly smells like lavender. The carrying case comes in handy as well to keep the pillow clean. I&#x27;m a little bummed the package says the lifespan is only  6 months before the insides &#x27;dry&#x27; out, but maybe I will rig something up if it comes down to that and buy a new refill. Great cheap stress pillow!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Delivered on time and as expected</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to this. However, it just didn&#x27;t stay hot. It wasn&#x27;t even warm. I even tried heating beyond the recommended time. Still wasn&#x27;t that warm. Lastly, I thought I would like the smell, as I love lavender, however, this didn&#x27;t smell that great. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but just not what I was expecting. The best way to describe the smell is a bowl of Fruit Loops...</li>
    <li> I bought three of these - one for me, one for my sister, and one for my mom. I can only speak for myself, but I love this product. When I am trying to relax at home, I pop it in the microwave for anywhere from 1 - 2 minutes (at 30 second intervals), put it on, and love the weight &amp; heat on my shoulders. It smells great too - wonderful to fall asleep with, or to have on while reading.</li>
    <li> i love the product but don&#x27;t like scent, I wish I could get the same product fragrance free</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who suffers neck pain and she reports that it lost it&#x27;s aroma after the first use. Nice pillow gift though.</li>
    <li> Very happy w/my purchase!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift and it is nice but the scent was more faint than I would have liked. Otherwise the recipient seems to like it- uses it when she gets migraines and says it helps. Got it very promptly and it looks like the photo image online. It is priced similarly to those you can find in any store.</li>
    <li> Excellent ..used daily</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful! Easy to heat and stays warm a long time. Easy storage and reduces stress quickly. A very good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to get relief from a stiff or sore neck. I use this at work and it fits comfortably around my neck as I work in front of a computer all day and it does not fall off or impead me from working.</li>
    <li> This neck pillow works wonders! Just pop it in a microwave for 2 minutes, and wrap it around the back of your neck for instant relief. Helps soothe tired and sore neck and shoulder muscles with deep heat. The lavender and chamomile scents help to relax and soothe away your tension. I suffer from severe migraines and this products definetly helps. The handy carry bag makes for a nice way to keep your neck pillow neat and clean and fresh for use everytime you need it. Makes a great gift. I have 2 of them!</li>
    <li> A gift for my wife&#x27;s sore neck and shoulders and she loves it.    Works great for her, smells terrific with the spices, and holds heat for a long time when heated to directions.  great product, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t even been a month and the poor pillow already split open. My boyfriend is a carpenter and fell in love with this thing then he saw rice falling out onto his shoulders. I can probably sew it, but he kind of wants to buy a new one just in case. It has put him to sleep before which was nice. If you like the smell of Froot Loops and the feeling of sweaty balls on your shoulders, I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a nice neck pillow you can heat up. It&#x27;s comfortable and sometimes I even wear it when I go to sleep.</li>
    <li> A heated shoulder and neck roll had been recommended by my message therapist for tightness in my shoulder muscles.  This Anti-Stress Pollow does the trick.  I am very pleased with it and use it several times a week with great results.</li>
    <li> I am using it for my nursers neck . Love it and helps me continue breast feeding .</li>
    <li> This totally not what I was looking for. I wanted a pillow so this sounded pretty cool. It smells really good. it is super soft and works well for heat on your neck but makes a horrible pillow. I do like the little storage bag it comes in too. If some comfort from neck pain is what you are looking for this will probably do the job but If your looking for a travel pillow...this is not it.</li>
    <li> No issues. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love to heat mine up and put it on my neck while I watch TV at night. It smells so soothing and it feels sooo good on my neck. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it cold yet, but I&#x27;m sure its just as good.</li>
    <li> it gives u head ache and neck pain instead of healing it. i would not recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this pillow because recently I have had a stiff neck and shoulders and my regular heating pad wasn&#x27;t doing the job. The product came a day before it was due to be delivered and it works great. My microwave heats the pillow in a minute and 50 seconds which seems to be the average time for most people. I read that it held heat for 2 hours but mine only holds the heat for 30 minutes but it feels great. It is a moist, warm heat and it soothed my muscles. Great product.</li>
    <li> These were bought as a gift for employees. The scent could be a bit stronger and the heat could last a little longer.</li>
    <li> I heat it up for 90 seconds in the microwave.  That is enough to give me relief if I want to lean back and watch TV or just&lt;br /&gt;sit and read a book.  It eases the tension in my neck and back of my head.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of these over the last few years.  I used to buy them at Kohls but they no longer carry them and was so happy when I found them on Amazon.  I use one every night when I go to bed.  They are fantastic for relieving sore muscles and sinus headaches.  They will stay warm for at least an hour and even longer with a blanket over them.  When my children were younger, I kept one in the freezer for bumps and bruises.  Frozen, they also work great on broken bones and after oral surgery.</li>
    <li> did not even open as zipper guide was missing, so item was defective, maybe i&#x27;ll try to order again.</li>
    <li> My neck pillow arrived when the seller said it would, intact. All is well!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the one my grandson ripped to shreds.  This is filled with rice which I did not like, but the cover is soft and was just the right size to replace the ruined one.  The one I had was flax and it fit perfectly so I am happy as a clam.</li>
    <li> The product is great, but I use this for terrible neck pain and mine was worn out.  So I ordered a replacement for me, and an extra for a Christmas gift...on DECEMBER 6th!!!  I have Amazon Prime so I automatically get free 2-day shipping.  The advertisement on their product says &amp;#34;want it for Christmas?  Order now and request 2-day shipping!&amp;#34;  Well, guess what!  I STILL do not have mine and it&#x27;s been nearly 3 weeks since I ordered!!!!  That is some really poor customer service!  I sent them an email last week asking for shipping information and was told they would check on why it hadn&#x27;t been shipped.  A week later....nothing!  Still hasn&#x27;t even shipped!  I do this type of work every day in my job and there is NO excuse for this poor of service!</li>
    <li> this is much smaller than I expected and isn&#x27;t filled as well as it should be. It does work well</li>
    <li> This is my third one I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.  I have problems with my neck and shoulders and this item is great for when I&#x27;m having neck pain or the muscles in my shoulders hurt.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for m wife, she loves it.  one minute in the microwave, in her chair with this behind her neck &amp; she is a happy camper.</li>
    <li> This pillow helps me with my migraines since my migraines come from muscle tension from my neck b/c I work on a PC a lot with the same posture. Once I feel tension in my neck area, I just warm this pillow up and put it around my neck. After a while, the tension is gone. I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
    <li> Really helps with neck pain</li>
    <li> Excellent product, especially for the price.  I use it when I&#x27;m sick and achy, make it cold if you have a migraine.  It helps me relax my shoulders where I hold tension and I like the washable cover.  Although I don&#x27;t care much for smelly/aromatic products, the scent is light enough not to be a bother.  I&#x27;ve bought it as a gift for others and they enjoy it too.</li>
    <li> Ok product.  Heats up well but not crazy about the smell.  Also a little on the heavy side. I bought one from a spa that I liked much better for same $.</li>
    <li> It does not smells like lavander!!! My mother-in-law is disappointed. I thought it will help to relieve stress but it did not! I want to return this product.</li>
    <li> Nice, but could be fuller.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this item. I have herniated disks in my neck and this is perfect. Very easy to heat up and use.</li>
    <li> warms perfectly in microwave for 2 minutes every time and is lightly scented with good grain/spice smell</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I believe it does help me relax somewhat and it keeps my tension headaches at bay, but I wish they could make it smell a bit better.  The warmth from the microwave lasts a long time and it fits nicely around my neck.</li>
    <li> Amazing! One of the only things to work for my muscle tension in my neck. I would highly recommend for those suffering anxiety or stress.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Was worried about fragrance, but out is very light and even pleasant!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Item was in good shape. Has held up so far. Smells nice. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some other neck pillows, but it holds heat for much longer.</li>
    <li> The smell definitely lessens quickly, but is nice while it lasts. The item holds heat well and is comfortable around the neck.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping it would relieve some stress in my neck/shoulders as I have Cervical Dystonia.  I like the moist heat and fragrance.  The only complaint I would have is that it is quite heavy.</li>
    <li> Love the comfort this neck pillow provides for the price.</li>
    <li> this is not a good value. i buy a neck pillow for my husband every christmas for his neck and shoulder pain and this one is the worst we&#x27;ve ever had. no scent as advertised and very small barely fits around your neck would not buy again!</li>
    <li> I sent this to a friend and she absolutely loves it!!</li>
    <li> Good product works well</li>
    <li> Thought this would be bigger.  It works ok but i&#x27;m a big guy and it doesn&#x27;t really fit around my neck.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use at my office - I have one at home I bought on a spa trip that I love and was looking for something similar. Things I like about this - the cover is nice and soft, it does heat up nicely in about 2.5 minutes and holds heat for about 30 minutes. Things I do not like - it&#x27;s only half-filled with rice so the rice really shifts around. The scent is a little funky, not pure lavender, and sometimes it&#x27;s off-putting. Also, the pale green color of the cover gets dirty REALLY quickly - although it&#x27;s washable and washes up nicely, mine is starting to unravel and it&#x27;s only been washed once.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase until I read in the product information that it needs to be replaced every six months.</li>
    <li> I needed a warm neck wrap that could be heated in the microwave.  This fits the bill quite nicely.  I wound up giving it the full two minutes in the microwave, one minute at a time, and turning it over in between shots.  It stays warm for the better part of an hour, and provides soothing warmth **and support** for my neck.  The lavender smell is only faint, but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me, as I am not into aromatherapy.  The carrying case is an added welcome touch.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love my neck pillow, it is not too heavy, it smells fantastic and it comes in a bag that keeps it clean and is easy to store. Compared to other products of this kind this is the best I have seen out there. Everytime I get a headache or stiff neck I can&#x27;t wait to use my neck pillow. Even my kids like to use it.</li>
    <li> Great pillow! Love the smell and warmth...very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for me, but it was so nice, that I gave it as a gift and it was much appreciated.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite scent, and instead of feeling soothing to my sore neck, it feels kind of heavy.  It heats up well though.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with neck and shoulder tightness/soreness. The scent which others felt was too strong was barely noticeable, and faded to basically nothing by the 3rd or 4th use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heating beads were not stitched in place effectively, leading to most of the beads collecting at the ends of the pillow, and fewer up by my neck. This resulted in heat only being applied to my lower neck and across my shoulders and upper chest. I would have liked more concentrated heat at my mind to upper neck, but there was no way to do this without propping/holding the pillow in place with a scarf or ace bandage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after a few weeks of use, I went to microwave it today, and part of it heated up at 1 minute 45 seconds so dramatically that part of it started to burn and melted the inside of the fleece cover. It now smells horrible, and I will be buying a different product to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for gentle, occasional warmth on your lower neck/collarbone area, this is a nice product. For real therapeutic use on the neck, I would consider a different product.</li>
    <li> The pillow does not get that warm and it is really flat like a pancake</li>
    <li> Love this! Soft, smells great, and has enough weight to hang around your neck and stay put.&lt;br /&gt;Has moist warmth that relaxes and relieves neck tension.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> I think this product is wonderful - I have since purchased two more for friends. They are equally as pleased!</li>
    <li> The neck wrap doesn&#x27;t have enough beads it and it doesn&#x27;t stay hot for very long. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same pillow since the early 2000&#x27;s.  My mom had purchased one from a local spa.  Then she moved across the country so I decided I had to get my own.  I contacted her to verify the brand name and model number and found it here, on Amazon.  This microwaveable pillow contains herbs &amp; scents that aide in relaxation.  Along with the heat therapy, the pleasant aromas help deal with every day pain and help me get to sleep faster.  If I could have an arsenal of anything, this would be it! This is a must-have for Moms.  It would definitely make a great Mother&#x27;s Day or Valentine&#x27;s Day present.</li>
    <li> Product worked well for about 5 months then got funny smell after heating in microwave according to instructions</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and is great on my neck.  It holds heat well and makes my neck feel so much better.</li>
    <li> I am not a security blanket kind of girl but it would be really hard to part with this now. Stays warm for FOREVER - 4- 6  hours if you heat it for about 4-5 mins. The smell kind of reminds me of popcorn) but not in a bad way! and I love the texture. I&#x27;ve noticed I knead it in my fingers when I fall asleep. I could see myself getting another one. One for my neck, one to shove down my pants in time of need. :)</li>
    <li> Loved the item the first time I used it, but then it would no longer work after that.</li>
    <li> It was slight wet/moist to touch after microwaving it for first time.  Used similar product before and did not remember it take way.  I did not like it moist.  It may go away after a few time but I didn&#x27;t check.</li>
    <li> The place I go to uses the similar neck pillow and I find it very soothing with&lt;br /&gt;steam and heat.  This product is even better with nice herbal smell.&lt;br /&gt;The nice weight on the shoulder; the heat lasts very long.  My concern is&lt;br /&gt;that I am not sure how long this wonderful &amp; soothing smell will last.</li>
    <li> After a friend told me how good this product was for tension headaches  I decided to try it and bought it at bed bath and beyond, however when I microwaved it for the first time it literally smelled like urine and Pine-Sol and the smell was overwhelming so much that I took it right back to the store that night. I have no doubts that this was at one time a good product but I guess they have changed what is in it and now it really is disgusting. I wouldn&#x27;t have paid a dollar for this and I&#x27;m really disappointed as it seems like a really nice product however trust me when I tell you that it is not. And whoever made this product obviously decided to use cheaper ingredients and now it is really really gross. I don&#x27;t usually return things if I can stand it but I honestly couldn&#x27;t stand this and I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to use it even one time. Please listen to my warning and buy something else.</li>
    <li> This is so soft. It heats so nice. The smell is heavenly but not over powering, very subtle. I have a strong sense of smell, my nose is very sensitive. I have had several of these microwaveable neck warmers and this is my favorite by far. Love it!! I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so luxurious for the price!</li>
    <li> Was a gift, the new Mom loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the pillow is very soft and comfortable!</li>
    <li> Terrible fruit loop smell,  but it does the job of relaxing the shoulder muscles.  It retained heat for 15 minutes  then I just put in back in microwave for 30 seconds to rehest.  I love that the cover is machine washable.  Also,  it is generously filled,  not skimpy at all.  I only gave it 3 stars because it really does smell overwhelmingly like fruit loops.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only rice! doesn&#x27;t give you any relief.&lt;br /&gt;buy a pound of rice heat it up and put it on your shoulders, you are goin to get the same results for .50 cents.</li>
    <li> I already own one of these and love it.  It retains heat, and works great.  I can wear it around the house while I do laundry and it stays on.  I bought one for my mom too and she loves it (and my sisters steal it a use it too).</li>
    <li> Helps me when my neck is sore. It is great when heated up, but it also helps just to prop under my neck when not heated.</li>
    <li> gift got a thankyou card to day saying thankyou i do not havbe 7 more word to display contempt for you soft ware</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN EXPECTED...BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER ALSO....LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to give this to someone for Christmas.</li>
    <li> My favorite neck pillow for the money. I have two of them and will probably buy more. I have several disks out in my neck and this provides more relief than anything else I have tried. I heat mine but it can also be kept in the freezer to use as a cold pack.</li>
    <li> i heat it wrap around my neck very comforting, i have lymphoma and it seems to ease the neck pain</li>
    <li> Smells like a box of fruit loops. Not bad...not relaxing. Does give off a little moisture when warm. Seems heavy, but did the job. Can not use as travel pillow. It flattens out, but one can move beads around for comfortable position. Should be a little longer. Would not buy if you have a large neck</li>
    <li> The bag broke on the first day haha.  The pillow itself though is durable.  I only give it 3 stars due to the bag&#x27;s durability, and somewhat difficult to spot clean.</li>
    <li> I love...love...love this neck pillow.  I have degenerating discs in my neck from an auto accident 25 years ago.  I&#x27;ve been treated for chronic pain for over 15 years due to this accident.  I take some medications.  But, what helps the most is a warm neck pillow and massage.  Since I can&#x27;t afford frequent massage, I rely on my neck pillow.  I&#x27;ve had at least 5 of them and this is my favorite.  It heats well (3 minutes for me) and holds the heat for a long time.  My favorite thing, though, is that it&#x27;s so soft.  The fleece it&#x27;s made from is very soft!  I love how it feels on my neck. Mine doesn&#x27;t smell of lavender, but I don&#x27;t mind.  I&#x27;m sensitive to smells so it actually works out well for me.  If you want smell, buy some essential oils and use them on the uncovered pillow.</li>
    <li> Met all my expectations... great value! Love the smell, and carry-on bag comes in handy to keep the pillow clean.</li>
    <li> It is a nice size and smells pleasant enough. It has a wet-heat when you heat it up which is nice. The cover is washable. The main thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t stay hot for more than 15 min at a time and it takes at least three minutes to heat in the microwave. I think it&#x27;s over priced for what it is. An electric heating pad works better.</li>
    <li> awesome! Love it bring it to work with me pop it in the micrwave stays warm for a long time!!!</li>
    <li> It arrived VERY quickly and was exactly as described. It is slightly weighted and the added pressure is quite helpful on my neck when I&#x27;m just sitting at my desk doing work, or even watching tv! The scent is very pleasant too and has, so far, lasted. I would recommend it if you are like me and your &#x27;stress&#x27; settles in your shoulders.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of sewing and my neck/shoulder muscles tighten up.  This helps a lot.  It&#x27;s soft, smells heavenly, and stays in place.  It does seem to take a bit longer to heat, but it is a moist heat, and feels great.</li>
    <li> Smells great and sooooo relaxing to sit with this for a little while each evening. Love it and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this for my soar neck and it&#x27;s great.  Just pop it in the microwave for a few minutes and your on your way for soothing comfort</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that I now own another rice filled neck pillow.  I found it listed under the heading of flax filled neck pillow.  There was no mention of the filling, just the fragrance of Lavender.  I was dissatisfied with a rice filled neck pillow that I purchased in the past.  Anne</li>
    <li> Heated for two minutes as recommended. The warmth did not last long at all,maybe 15 min at best  and the  fragrance is awful. I agree with another reviewer,,,the rice sinks to the ends, leaving very little in the middle where I wanted it. Sorry, but I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this neck pillow. It smells great. After I take it out of microwave, it doesn&#x27;t feel as warm until I rest it on my shoulders. It is a nice stress reliever.</li>
    <li> itwas a gift , she says she uses it all the time and is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this product blew me away. I&#x27;m in my third trimester and have horrible headaches and can&#x27;t sleep well at night, this fixed both of those issues.</li>
    <li> This neck pillow smells good, the scent isn&#x27;t to strong where you can hardly breath, but a right amount of scent.  I use it all the time and as long as you follow directions and heat in 30 second intervals, the pillow will not smell burnt.  It stays warm for a while and I use it all the time! I always get pinched nerves in my neck and back and the heated neck pillow helps tremendously!</li>
    <li> We love love our pillows.  They give great support to neck and when you heat them, they give relieve for  discomfort of neck pain.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible.  Just can&#x27;t get past it!!!</li>
    <li> This pillow is adequate--it&#x27;s a little hard and doesn&#x27;t soothe my arthritic neck as much as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, so comfortable. I love it!</li>
    <li> My neck gets sore and this pillow helps.  You can heat it up in the microwave and its feels great!</li>
    <li> I got this for my father who suffers from neck pain. I am happy to report he is feeling better both in his neck and arm from the heat therapy.</li>
    <li> I love this pillow :). It holds heat beautifully and for longer than you would expect. It isn&#x27;t electric so you don&#x27;t have to worry about dosing off with it on. The smell is very pleasant, not overpowering. It did dissipate when I washed the covering, but that is to be expected I would imagine! Great pillow for a sore neck or stress relief. Even the weight of it is comforting on your neck and upper shoulders.  I will be giving these as gifts becasue I am so pleased myself with the product.</li>
    <li> This item is great and would recommend it to anyone  who needs a  heating pad . Comfortable around your neck</li>
    <li> This perfect for relaxing right before bedtime. I have arthritis and my neck gets very stiff and this helps me to relax,</li>
    <li> Bought this for my niece. She loves it as I do mine. Looked all over town and then thought of Amazon and had it purchased it less than five minutes.</li>
    <li> The only reason I rated this 2 star is because it gives off precipitation that is less than desirable. My neck and shoulders are wet now because of it. I am using it for the first time right now and not sure I will use it again because of this. I also do not care for the &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; scent that it says the pillow has. It does not smell like lavender. I will say that I like the weight and warmth it provides.</li>
    <li> Great neck pillow.  I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend who has a stressful job.  I tried it out as well.  Almost took it back so I could have it because it was so nice!</li>
    <li> Love it. Great for hot or cold. Holds the temperature for a long while and is comfortable. Recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Holds heat well and is soft and comfortable.  Easily fits even small microwave and can take at least 1min./45 secs. time which is right for me.</li>
    <li> Scent wasn&#x27;t really there and would loose its warmth right away. The pillow covering is very soft though. It did its job for awhile but has been put away for now.</li>
    <li> bought as a gift - person loved it.</li>
    <li> I did massage for a number of years, and have always wanted to invest in one of these myself.  I was looking at the expensive ones, but this one seemed similar and okay for home use.  The package came in a reasonable amount of time and was packed well--not the shipper&#x27;s fault at all.  The company that makes it however, puts A LOT of strong fragrance in there.  I understand having a little lavender but I was gagging a little on the volume of it and the camomile.  I followed the directions for microwave heating, but it has been a couple of weeks, and I use it twice a day.  It heats up well still, but my god it stinks like burnt rice now.  My kids have requested that I stop using it because it just plain stinks.  The cover is still clean, and it only stinks after a re-heat---but buy a higher quality neck pad with buckwheat or something if you are gonna need it for an extended time.  Not spa quality for sure.</li>
    <li> When I first used this at my daughter&#x27;s, I knew I had to have my own.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderfully relaxing with the warmth that&#x27;s so soothing.  After your so relaxed that your stress is gone.</li>
    <li> The pillow is nice and soft, but it does not smell like lavender at all. I was disappointed, as I was expecting the lavender+chamomile it advertises.</li>
