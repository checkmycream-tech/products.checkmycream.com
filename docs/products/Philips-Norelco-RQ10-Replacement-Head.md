<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product - great service!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast ship. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Philips has mastered shaving...&lt;br /&gt;The heads work well and give you a very close save.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend the product to a friend</li>
    <li> Very good item for the price.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T THINK MUCH OF A 3 HEAD RAZ. BETTER OFF TO THROW THE WHOLE THING AWAY SND BUY A GOD ONE. REMEMBER YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.</li>
    <li> Replacement for my husbands razor.  We almost bought a new razor and last minute decided to try a new replacement head. this made his razor just like new!</li>
    <li> This renewal keep my razor head sharp and cutting my beard well.&lt;br /&gt;It is good to have it replaced frequently.</li>
    <li> I need to remember to replace these more often--it says they should be replaced annually.</li>
    <li> Definitely sharper than my old original blades that i left on for years, since i first got it as a gift...  However, you do still have to go over an area several times before getting a good shave without leaving any straggler-whiskers behind!</li>
    <li> Now I know why I wasn&#x27;t getting as close of a shave!  I should have bought two of these to have one as a back up for when the new one stops shaving so closely again.  The original head was used for nearly four years so I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth out of it.  It was very easy to take the old one off and put the new one on and it works great!</li>
    <li> Fast, efficient, and &amp;#34;close enough&amp;#34;! No steel on my baby face! I get a good shave in half the time.</li>
    <li> Received in timely fashion. What a quick and easy way to extend the life of your razor, and get the cut like it was brand new.</li>
    <li> What do you do when your Norelco cutters become dull? You either buy new cutter and comb sets or a new expensive replacement head (RQ10). Now they make it difficult to change out the cutters on the latest models. The older Norelco shavers are very easy to pop in new cutters but this new 1 piece shaver head takes a little brain power to figure out. Here is how to disassemble this head unit and remove the cutters to be sharpened by hand. It&#x27;s actually very easy! Do one cutter at a time. All you need is a very hard Arkansas sharpening stone.  1. Open up one blade cutter and use a miniature flat screwdriver to pop off the plastic ring surrounding the cutter. At the 9 &amp; 3 o&#x27;clock position there are 2 tabs. simply pry up the black plastic   ring at these 2 points and the ring will pop off. 2. The cutter-comb assembly will then be able to be removed. The stainless steel ring will remain connected to the head unit. Leave it this way. 3. Notice that the round metal comb assembly has 3 notches (2-small &amp; 1-larger). Important when reassembling! 4. Using a stiff toothbrush, soak these items in hot soapy water and scrub them with the brush. Easy to get squeaky clean! 5. When finished, dry them-then on a hard Arkansas sharpening stone, put a drop of fine oil and in a circular motion sharpen the cutter. Takes just a few strokes! Don&#x27;t press too hard. 6. Now reassemble the blade and comb. Turn the comb so the notches match up with the plastic assembly. Now insert the rotary blade cutter. Match up the plastic comb and cutter assembly so the   4 nodules fit inside the stainless steel ring. Now match the nodules of the black plastic locking ring, press down on it at the tabs and snap it into place. That&#x27;s all there is to it! Now   move on to the other 2 cutters. 7. When finished, your head unit will cut like new!    NORELCO DOESN&#x27;T TELL YOU HOW TO DO THIS-THEY JUST WANT TO SELL YOU A NEW HEAD UNIT. Some vendors charge up to $60 for this replacement head (RQ10)!to $60 for this replacement head (RQ10)!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to a replacement razor set for your arcitec, these will fit, and generally last about a year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the major flaw in this unit is that you can&#x27;t remove the razor heads (at least i haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how) to clean them individually, so after a while hair will accumulate and I think overall the system itself doesn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as I would like, but it gets me close enough to where i can touch up with a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But... i think if you&#x27;re looking at these, then you may alredy own the arcitec, and these will fit.  I&#x27;ve ordered three replacement sets over the past few years, they&#x27;ve all shipped in good condition and fit without issue.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Fast shipping. Product exactly as described.</li>
    <li> These heads are a bit spendy but the razor works good. In order to keep optimum performance I need to change the head about once every three months.</li>
    <li> This is a factory replacement part, so it fits and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also pretty pricey.  Do you need it?  Yes, no question.  As the cutters spin against the screens in the shaving heads, they slowly and steadily wear down.  When you replace the head, you can feel the difference immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  This is a necessary maintenance item which will keep your razor working and feeling like it&#x27;s new.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  I love what a nice close smooth shave he gets from it.  These replacement heads might seem pricey however, they last him over a year and far surpass other electric razors he has had through the years.</li>
    <li> After three years if nearly daily use, my old blades were more self inflicted torture than a decent shave. Yes, the new heads are pricey but they get the job done correctly and effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations perfectly. Started using it the first day;. Gives me a clean, close shave every time and the service by Amazon was great.</li>
    <li> Very expensive (this RQ10 model) vs. other heads, hard to locate, but does it&#x27;s job. I wish maker would sell it cheaper and sell this part in many places.</li>
    <li> My husband is more than pleased with the replacement head, it&#x27;s working perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;He would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Once in a great while the shaver head has to be replaced. There&#x27;s no substitute for sharp blades. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> After two and a half months of waiting on this product I have decided to give up and realize that its just not going to make it.  Now, im currently in Afghanistan and I totally realize that the mail takes a bit longer then back in the states,.. But two and a half months?! Thats just crazy talk.  The product is good and I like it, but this seller needs some work. Thanks for nothing.</li>
    <li> very good price for this item.</li>
    <li> Have owned the Norelco RQ10 razor for over a year now and very pleased with performance/quality/maintenance. My main problem is cost for replacement blades which are, I feel, expensive since they probably should be replaced every 8 - 10 months for max. performance. The most economical answer would be to replace just the circular blades and combs, not the whole head which seems to hold up fine. Ability to remove old blades and trying to get actual mfg. new blades (not knock-offs or used items) via online would be the big problems, any suggestions?</li>
    <li> The instruction say that you should change the Unit once a year.  I waited about six months beyond that date.  Big mistake.  I used to have to go over and over my face to get an O.K. shave.  Now in a fraction of the time I get a great shave.  I thought that the battery on my razor needed to be replaced because it would only last about four or five days... With the new blades and the quicker shave the battery has lasted more than three weeks!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves the performance and cut of this razor, however, the blades are difficult to find in the stores. We usually have to purchase these online, which works out better since there is no shipping or tax; BUT once the blades go out, there is no warning, and, the razor completely stops working until you replace the head. The last time this happened I had to go buy him a \\&quot;backup\\&quot; razor to get him through until the blades were received in the mail.</li>
    <li> I love the shaver this goes with.  One a year keeps it shaving close.</li>
    <li> It beat running to the mall. Ordered on line and within a week I received my shaving unit. With the cost of gas running around this year was out of the question. Not everyone carries the Norelco RQ10. Thank you Amazon for making my life a little easier.</li>
    <li> My Norelco Arcitec shaver is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, but I have been somewhat disappointed by both of the replacement heads I&#x27;ve purchased over the last year or so.  For whatever reason, the replacement heads just do not work as well as the original heads that came with the shaver.  I was thrilled to have found a shaver that could actually cut the hairs on my neck quickly and thoroughly, but now I am forced to go over those more troublesome neck hairs time and again, from different angles, to try and get those sorry buggers clipped.  Shaving my face is less problematic, but I must say I got a closer shave with the original heads.  Now that I&#x27;ve had the same experience with two replacement heads, I can&#x27;t help thinking that either something has changed in terms of the manufacturing process of the razor heads or Philips Norelco just puts better quality heads in the original shavers.  I&#x27;m still an Arcitec fan and will continue using this shaver - and these replacement heads - for the foreseeable future, but my love affair with my Arcitec shaver lacks the passion it once had.</li>
    <li> This replacement head for my Arcitec razor made a new one of it. To me it is way overpriced by Norelco but it is the one you must have when the old head becomes dull and used up. No way to replace just the cutters and this is the only way to revitalize your expensive razor. I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase, which was my only option to continue using it.</li>
    <li> This replacemnt head was what i needed to get the good shave i was getting before when the razor was new and was less at amazon than at Philips.</li>
    <li> For $35-$40, depending on the sale running, it keeps your relatively expensive Arcitec shaver new.  The bargain is that when blades go dull, most people just buy new shaving heads (HQ9) but heads are exactly the same price!  The RQ10, however, is the entire shaving \\&quot;unit\\&quot;, the complete pop-off, pop-on, business end of the shaver, and Philips INCLUDES new shaving heads in the unit.  Essentially, you have a new electric shaver for the same price as just new blades. Maybe it&#x27;s only a relative bargain, but I would have kicked myself if I&#x27;d bought just the heads.</li>
    <li> Amazon sell this for about half what phillips/norelco website sells it for. Great deal if you own a Arcitec shaver</li>
    <li> I order this for him every year. He says he doesn&#x27;t hate shaving anymore b/c this blade is awsome n does a clean cut.</li>
    <li> New head cuts just fine.  The problem is if you put just slight pressure on your face the new head falls off the body.  It&#x27;s easy to replace, very annoying.  Next time I&#x27;ll just replace the entire unit.</li>
    <li> Cuts like the original head. This one has a plastic connector to the base instead of the metal connector that the original has. The new head pops off while shaving which is annoying.</li>
    <li> Though the rep[lacement shaver blade is the correct unit, the construction has changed.  Instead of a all metal mounting connection, it is now plastic and it doesn&#x27;t stay securely in the razor.  Depending on the positon the razor is on your face, the razor head will pop out.  No damage is done biut it&#x27;s more irritating of a inconvenience than anything else.  Going forward I will research this potential design flaw before purcahsing from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Poor shaving performance.</li>
    <li> After watching glowing adds on television, I ordered my new arcitec shaver  It has been a costly mistake. It never really gave a close shave After    only a few months, I thought perhaps new blades would be a cure to the problem. getting \\&quot;sticker shock\\&quot; checking the price of new blades, I just gave up and now appreciate my old manual shaver much more. I now get my old clean smooth shaves again. what a waste!</li>
    <li> I  purchased my Norelco Arcitech and the replacement shaving unit from Amazon.  I received the best price from them and am totally happy with both products.  I&#x27;ve never had a better shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the original part for the shaver and will make your shaver as good as new. The list price of $45 is quite steep considering you can buy a new shaver for thta much and sale price of $34 isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
    <li> The replacements are better than the originals. I always keep an extra pack on hand.</li>
    <li> Although I still have -- and occasionally still use, mainly for a touchup --a Braun electric shaver,I find it by Norelco provides a more comfortable, smoother, and quicker shave, though perhaps not quite as close.I&#x27;m very happy with it, and the Norelco RQ10 replacement head is well engineered, long lasting,easy to clean, and entirely satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it was about $10.00 cheaper online compared to my local stores, plus I didn&#x27;t have to pay sales tax or shipping cost.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I have been a norelco shaver customer for more years than I care to admit. This shaver (the arcitec RQ10) is in my opinion just about the worst of all the others that I had used in the past. It does not have a smooth operation over the skin and it leaves patches of hairs that it misses during the shaving process. Even the trimmer is located in such a remote spot that does not give an easy view when in use.  I was happy with the previous models so I believe that I will look for and use the last shaver and put this model into the archives.  My advice is: Don&#x27;t spend your money on this model.</li>
    <li> just what my husband wanted</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed. I thought by purchasing one of the higher priced models it would result in a closer, cleaner shave.  $178.00 later, this model performed no better than my old $35. Norelco</li>
    <li> A real relief to find these. Thank you.</li>
    <li> i PURCHASED THIS, WHAT i ASSUMED TO BE NEW  shaving  part for my Norelco electric razor.  I threw away the old part but thnk this one does a very poor job of shaving.  I even tried using preshave which, I never had to do with the original blades.  I feel the new part is not as good as what I had.  In reading the manual for my norelco, which is just a little over a year, it said once a year you did need to replace the shaving bladss.  This I did but cannot understand  how it does such a poor job.  I use my automatic cleaner and new fluid etc.  I am reverting back to the old shaving creme and regular manual razor to get a decent shave. Glad you asked for this review.  Chuck Wood</li>
    <li> Great product. Simple to replace old one and makes a world of difference in the shaving results.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good unit. like the way you have to charge itt. only complaint it is noisy.</li>
    <li> The old one worked over 4 years,hope this one have the same quality.</li>
    <li> Replacement for my old razor head, works great.  Back to getting closer shaves faster..</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers with great satisfaction for 37 years. I love the Arcitec, but am very disappointed with the head unit. I like the other models that allow me to disassemble them to clean thoroughly. The Arcitec heads last only 8 months, and they are very costly to replace. I will not replace this one again, but will consider a different model. I am on my third head in two years.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, as ordered, but the package was already opened.  I installed and used it anyway, but it gives me pause to think that it might have been reconditioned and offered at full retail.  I will ask that question next time I place an order.</li>
    <li> After searching in stores for the Philips Norelco RQ10 Shaving Unit, I looked on Amazon and found it - ordered it for a good price and it came pretty quickly.  Very satisfied, Thanks.</li>
    <li> its doing great job and working fine Praful.</li>
    <li> Hard to find and very expensive</li>
    <li> The head replacement for my arcitek is just fine.  What more can one say....</li>
    <li> I needed replacement heads for my Norelco Arcitec razor.  After shopping around on the internet I went to Amazon, found the product, got the best price and free shipping.  The replacement heads were perfect.    As in the past I am completely satisfied with Amazon and the way that they treat their customers.  I will continue ordering from them.</li>
    <li> As I expected a very good product in quality and functionality</li>
    <li> Great - arrived on time and worked well.</li>
    <li> Product never arrived, huge time wasting argument with Amazon customer service. They could not have cared less.  Never again, trust me.</li>
    <li> Best replacement for norelco product yet.  Just pop the old one off and pop the new one on.  Could not be easier.</li>
    <li> I had to go back to the RQ10 for my Norelco Arcitec shaver, since the RQ12 heads are no longer available at a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve had excellent experience with the RQ10 in the past, replacing them every 12 months. This is probably my 7th or 8th set of replacement heads for the Arcitec body, and it is still going strong. I shave every day, and rinse the heads immediately after shaving. The RQ10 and RQ12 heads do a great job, and I honestly did not notice a big difference in shave-quality between the two. As long as the Arcitec keeps re-charging when needed, I&#x27;ll keep getting the RQ10 replacement heads each year.</li>
    <li> This shaver head works great and AMAZON HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PLACE TO ORDER FROM.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much :), we were unable to find this anywhere in the store, so thank you again.</li>
    <li> Received the Norelco as a gift.  As a women I use if on my legs, works okay, but I much prefer the women&#x27;s remington.  I also own a Panasonic curve.  Great for underarm area.</li>
    <li> The Norelco head is easy to replace and yes, it should be replaced about once a year for maximum results!</li>
    <li> This is the second RQ10 I have purchased. It works fine for me but it is not fair to expect it to last for two years.</li>
    <li> I used the Mach3 Turbo razor for a year and other manual razors prior to that for years. I finally got tired of paying so much for blades every month that I thought I would try electric razors. After trying Braun I saw the Norelco Arcitec and bought it. It&#x27;s a fantastic razor and the cost of the replacement blade (currently $35) is a huge savings as it needs to be replaced every 6-12 months, which saves a ton since I was paying $15 a month on replacement razor blades for my Mach3. This is a huge savings both financially and in the amount of time it takes to shave. I really like the Arcitec razor and this head is the perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> They were the excat thing I was looking for.  I have been using this razor now for 3 years and am very happy with it.  I get a very close shave and receive no razor burns which I get very easy because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> IT ARRIVED ON TIME. THE SHAVING IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED SOMETHING BETTER, MY OLD BLADES DID A BETTER JOB SHAVING.</li>
    <li> It is the better quality and has lasted over a year longer (and still in service) than the original) head.</li>
    <li> Great product , thanks</li>
    <li> I like my Norelco, however, the blades really do need to be replaced after 12 - 18 months of daily use. This replacement works as advertised and I like the shave.</li>
    <li> it arrives quickly and on time in brand new condition works perfectly with my razor it is what I would expect to pay and obtain for what was advertised</li>
    <li> As a happy Aztec razor owner, I have the desire to maintain the excellent shaving feature of this product by replacing the shaving head every year. Whereas this particular replacement head is hard to locate, I am happy that Amazon.com has it available for purchase.</li>
    <li> The rotary blades did not work at first.  I sprayed them with WD40, and they still didn&#x27;t work.  A couple of days later, when I was getting ready to return it, I ran it again, so I could accurately describe the problem.  It worked perfectly tnen and has ever since.  I hope it keeps working, because I really like the shaver.</li>
    <li> The Shaver itself is the good part. The shaver heads are \\&quot;OK\\&quot;, never seem to last as long as you would like. However, I&#x27;m happy with my choices.</li>
    <li> As the title says, this replacement head fell apart after 2 months, and no help from amazon</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades</li>
    <li> Great price great product fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades arrived quickly and it was very easy to change them out. I would buy again from this supplier.</li>
    <li> These heads last for a good nine months to a year. I use it every two days because I&#x27;m in the hospitality business and it lasted me a year.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product to use especially if you can&#x27;t find the replacement heads in retailed stores; which saves you a bunch of $$$ than having to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> The item shipped on time and was a good price. I would reorder this again from this source when needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shaver types over the years.  This gets the closest shave. But the blades don&#x27;t last very long, and they&#x27;re fairly expensive.</li>
    <li> The RQ10 arrived in a timely fashion in a Norelco box and worked exactly like the Norelco replacement I bought in a store last year.  I used previous Norelco shavers I bought for 15 to 20 years without ever replacing the blades.  I used the Arcitec for 1-1/2 years and found the blade needed replacing. I used the replacement only a year and find this is about the optimum time for replacing blades.    While I do have to go over my face more times than with previous Norelcos (even with 15 year old blades), the shave with this razor is so smooth I can shave seven days a week.  With previous Norelcos, I had to take a day or two off from shaving every week because my face would become irritated.    In summary, the blade must be replaced much more frequently with this shaver than previous Norelcos, but the comfortable smooth shave makes it worth the added expense.</li>
    <li> Fell off routinely, poor fit. The locks did not hold it well. Bought a new razor.</li>
    <li> My dad was looking for a replacement head and we found these were almost $20 cheaper than the same ones offered at the phillips website.</li>
    <li> It replaces my old, worn-out one perfectly. Now my shaver works like mew. Furthermore, it costs less than it would be if bought from Norelco on0line directly.</li>
    <li> This item is great my Philips Norelco works as good as when I first bought it. I did not think there would be that much of a difference but there is.</li>
    <li> I bought my arcitec shaver about 20 months ago, and it&#x27;s been the best shave compared to any of the 5 Norelco razors I&#x27;ve owned in the past.    With the RQ10 shaving unit replacement heads, it works as good as new.  Amazon had the best available price by far.  It was amazingly simple to install.  Just pull the old one off, snap the new one in, and start shaving.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and it definitely met my expectations.</li>
    <li> visited the store that I purchased the shaver from and they DO NOT carry the blades for this item, even though it was the best and most expensive, thank you Amazon .  JG</li>
    <li> as annoying as it is to spend  the $$$ on another set of shaving heads every year, I do find that right around the time my indicator reminds me it IS time, I start  cutting myself abit, whilst shaving....or,  it just doesn&#x27;t  do a close shave as easily, and perhaps, with  a little nick or  razor burn.  Pop the new heads in, and voila, it is like a brand new razor again..(.until  this time  again, next year!).    Prices vary alot, so it is wise to at least hunt for the best deals.  Wish  the head quality would last longer, but there&#x27;s the plight of consumer capitalism.</li>
    <li> My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease so I often help him shave. We had a hard time finding a new head for this razor, but finally found these at Amazon. We&#x27;re pleasantly surprised how much faster the new head whittles the whiskers. :) Glad we bought 2, so now we have a back-up as soon as this one wears out. Then we&#x27;ll be back to buy 2 more!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described, and much cheaper than a full replacement.  The blade section simply pops off, turning old razor into new.  Like new performance, back to a close shave again.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this razor,very happily, for a few years now &amp; is now back to a smooth face after replacing his blade unit. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This replacement razor head is a close cut every time. Just what I was looking for. This is the second time purchasing and I will do it again and again.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy snap on installation, works very well, just like when I bought the shaver new</li>
    <li> This is it for a close shave, the replacement blade last for a year if you take care of it properly. My skin is like a baby&#x27;s fine skin and for me I feel like i&#x27;ve taken the closes shave I could possibley have.</li>
    <li> I recommend to change your unit once a year , the shaver works much better</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t last to long because of the constant use.  The cost was within my budget and cheaper then stores in the area. JCI</li>
    <li> I did not know how dull the blades were until I put the new head on. Boy what a vast inprovement. Shaves as if it were new again.</li>
    <li> perfect, hope this item does not get discontinued</li>
    <li> Excellent quality - as expected.  Note: if you are replacing a unit that has the blinking &#x27;replace unit&#x27; light, it takes 2 -3 days to reset.</li>
    <li> The replacement head is easy to change &amp; a lot cheaper than replace than buying a new one.  I didn&#x27;t want to get rid of the razor because it is the best I have ever had in my 83 years</li>
    <li> Husband really loved his raze and nothing else would match this model. So happy a replacement dead was the answer</li>
    <li> This genuine product was 1/2 the price from the retail store where I was going to buy it. My razor now shaves like it is new!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, not a whole lot better than the original blades though. Mine were three years old and, I guess, still working ok compared to these.</li>
    <li> When I received the new Razor head, I applied it to my 1060X Norelco Razor.  Upon using the new Razor Head it would not shave my beard.  As a result I am out $33.99.    I would like a replacement sent to me at no cost to me.  Naturally I am disappointed, since this is the second one I ordered from you.      Thank you for your kind inquiry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Amazon.com and receieved it in a timely way. It was easy to replace on my electric razor and I having been using it for a few weeks now and I am completely satisfied. I recommend purchasing products through Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Seems almost pointless to leave a review for a repair or maintenance part, but to counterbalance some of the negativity in the other reviews, I have to say that replacing my nearly two-year-old head (yeah, it&#x27;s the entire head, not just the foils and blades) demonstrated just how much the old one had deteriorated.  My face is much prettier now that there are no more single uncut hairs poking out here and there AND, the whole job took half the time it had been taking!  Amazon would like people to sign up for scheduled delivery of this item for a reduced price.  Good idea, actually, except that the longest period they support is six months which isn&#x27;t really reasonable unless, maybe, you&#x27;re the Abominable Snowman or Bigfoot and doing a lot of job interviews lately.  If they offered something longer, like a year, I just might take them up on it.  How about it, Amazon?</li>
    <li> I plan on ordering another - the first blades lasted 2 years and I expect this one to do the same.</li>
    <li> The old blades were still working fine, but changing the blades after 1 year does make a big difference.  This purchase was well worth the cost and will make your shaving experience better.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly; cleans easily.</li>
    <li> Razor works like new with the replacement heads. Easy to install, affordably priced. Blades are very sharp and get a clean ,close shave.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how long I have my shaver, but I thought recently that I might need to replace the shaving head; and indeed, there is that excellent shaving experience again; just do not fogoet it; there is nothing that can predict you when to replace it...</li>
    <li> I bought one of the Norelco Arcitec shavers last year and needed some replacement heads.  The replacement unit fit on fine and has worked out well.  The price was less then in at the store and it was delivered right to my door.  It has work out well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this replacement shaving head for my electric razor received as a gift, after discovering the merchant who sells the shaver does not carry replacement parts as this; i.e.: Wal-Mart. It made the shaver like new again and while recommended replacement is yearly, I will consider replacing each six months to maintain comfort. Installation is a matter of seconds; simply pull the old one off and place the new one on-done.</li>
    <li> Sure made a difference. I still had the original which was over a year old. It took 2 or 3 shaves for the heads to really get to working perfect. Guess it takes times for them to wear in a little but now they are like new.</li>
    <li> It dies what it was purchased for. i.e. it shaves the face!</li>
    <li> bought as a replacement for arcitec 1050. Works as advertised, wish it was a little cheaper, but a quality product nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED A NORELCO ARCITECT SHAVER FOR CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR FOR MY HUSBAND AND NEEDED A REPLACEMENT HEAD AS THEY USUALLY LAST A YEAR WITH HEAVY USE.  HE IS VERY PICKY AND LOVES THE SHAVER AND REPLACEMENT HEAD SO WE ARE BOTH HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Replacement OK except the package was opened.  Not sure if it was a new one or not.</li>
    <li> It gives me another year of comfortable shaving. I have been replacing the head for years. Others with heavier beards may require more frequent changes.</li>
    <li> my razor works like new</li>
    <li> It was a little tricky to take off the old head, but the new one is a snap to attach.  After using it a few times I must say that my razor shaves like it&#x27;s brand new now.  As a replacement it&#x27;s a little pricey, but far less expensive than buying an entire new unit.  I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I CHANGE MY NORELCO BLADES EVERY SIX MONTS TO KEEP A VERY CLOSE SHAVE.THE ARCHITECT ELEC. RAZOR IS THE BEST!</li>
    <li> It has a smooth feel, but it misses too many whiskers on the chin area.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father.  He has a hard time moving or turning his neck.  The flexible head is a great feature that still let&#x27;s him get the close shave he likes.</li>
    <li> No issues with model 1060X. Easy replacement and cuts great! I will probably purchase another one when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this head for my father-in-law who&#x27;s razor stopped working. One of the blades was locked up so it would not turn without opening the heads. I talked him into buying this replacement head instead of purchasing a new razor ($$$$).    The heads arrived very quickly (3 days). The instructions were not clear how to replace them. You just grab the old head and pull it straight off. Then the new head pops back on.    My father-in-law was amazed how much better the razor worked with the new head (like new) since he replaced it because it didn&#x27;t work at all, not that they were dull (they were).</li>
    <li> Order process was easy.  Delivery quicker than promised.  Product was easy to install and works very good.</li>
    <li> This a new replacement head for my shaver. I can say it is a very good unit and arrived quickly. I no longer have a hairy face and look 15 again!!.</li>
    <li> The replacement head for my shaver works great.  I always like items purchased from Amazon and this was no exception.</li>
    <li> This unit arrived early &amp; was very easy to install. I did not realize that my present razor blades were dull. I&#x27;ll be changing these every year from now on.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t deal with this vendor.  Ordered replacement part for Norelco and they sent a package with the plastic clearly opened.  Decided to try it anyway, it kept coming off the shaver head.  This was probably a returned item that they happily sent off to the next customer.  They did not respond to have it replaced.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time cleans razor great and keeps it running ex norcel is a good product keep making it</li>
    <li> The new RQ12 from the SensoTouch 3D is a direct fit for the Arcitec.  Gives a much better shave in half the time.  If you&#x27;re one of the reviewers who have trouble with the RQ10 needing multiple passes over the same area, pick up the RQ12.  MUCH closer shave.    Just wanted to update this info.  For anyone who uses the Arcitec Jet Clean system or the Arcitec travel case, the RQ12 will NOT fit either of those accessories.</li>
    <li> Not real thrilled. The Arcitec razor does an adequate job except for under my chin and neck area.    The replacement heads are VERY,VERY expensive,and only last about (6) months until they become dull.    We live in western Georgia and Wal-Mart does not carry the replacement heads so I have a hard time locating this item.    Bill Gilmore    West Point,Ga</li>
    <li> After not being able to find new blades for my Norelco RQ10 I knew where to turn.  AMAZON.  Fast-easy-always reliable!</li>
    <li> the price was allot cheaper than i thought possible and i was awaiting poor quality or a cheap imitation. it was neither. great quality,great price and delivered on time. in fact before the schedule delivery date. awesome customer satisfaction with this company. i will go to them for another part and anything else we need for our norelco or any other similar needs [[ASIN:B000UK16AI Philips Norelco RQ10 Shaving Unit, Triple Track Replacement Head]]</li>
    <li> i have used norelco products for 2o years and it was time to replace the&lt;br /&gt;head on this shaver and amazon had the best price and and alsway the best&lt;br /&gt;service.</li>
    <li> Just bought two replacement head units and neither one of these will stay on the Arcitec shaver during a shave.  Yet the old head assembly will stay on just fine.  This stuff is pure junk!  Guess I&#x27;ve bought my last Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> I received my Norelco RQ10 Replacement Head yesterday, this morning I went to replace the head on my arcitec shaver. The shave was nice and close to the skin but the replacement head would not stay on the shaving unit. The RQ10 Replacement Head I bought from Amazon.com would just fall out while shaving!! I replaced the new RQ10 Replacement Head I got from Amazon.com with my original shaving head and I was able to shave without any problems with the old head on the unit, the old head would not fall out of the unit. So it has to be a defective RQ10 Replacement Head!! I&#x27;m returning it tonight after I get home. I did notice that the part that is inserted into the shaver on the new RQ10 Replacement Head is made out of plastic while the original head is made of some kind of metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to get a new replacement head to replace this defective head and see if it was a fluke, but right now I&#x27;m not too encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I received the Norelco RQ10 replacement head for the defective one I first received and I have to say this one works just like the original head that came with the razor!! I would give it more stars but at this time the quality of the Norelco RQ10 Replacement heads may be suspect. So because of the trouble I had to go through to return the first replacement head I give it 3/5 stars. If the first Norelco RQ10 replacement head wasn&#x27;t defective then I would give it a solid 4/5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I buy one of these each year on a regular basis.  Easy way to make sure you have sharp blades.</li>
    <li> I buy these replacement heads every year for my razor and have never been disappointed.  They arrive on time and work great.  There really isn&#x27;t much more you can say.</li>
    <li> I just replaced my razor head after a year and a half and it&#x27;s amazing the difference.  The product was easy to install and the price was the best around.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement head at a good price.</li>
    <li> This makes the Arctitec machine as good as it was when new. I wonder if some lubrication will make it more durable, the first one lasted about two years.</li>
    <li> I never thought to change my razor head, and have had my razor for a number of years.  Made a huge difference, I think I will do that every year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my Norelco razor daily for over 2 years and the replace heads symbol finally came on.  The Amazon price is great and my razor gives me a great close shave with fewer passes.</li>
    <li> Unit arrived on time.  Worked just perfectly. Amazon price compared to Phipps store price was excellent.[[ASIN:B000UK16AI Philips Norelco RQ10 Shaving Unit]]</li>
    <li> works great. new life for my shaver</li>
    <li> This replacement head work great. Highly Recommend buying this part.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do the job I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE ORDERED THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON . IT ARRIVRD TO MY PLACE IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS. THE PACKAGE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND ALSO THE SHAVING UNIT.SO I WAS HAPPY TO HAVE IT IN TIME I NEED IT.  THANKS TO AMAZON.</li>
    <li> This company was so prompt and fast in getting this new shaver head to me, I had very little stubble to shave off.  Super company to do business with.  I&#x27;m ordering another.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years and am always satisfied, Noreclo builds good Razors and they are reliable and long lasting.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertized and the price was the best I could find. What more is there to like?</li>
    <li> Always buy original parts.  Do it right the first time!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty self explanatory review. The product arrived quickly and fits perfect. Recommended with amazons subscription feature. Great price too.</li>
    <li> The Shave:&lt;br /&gt;The floating heads on the Norelco electric shaver really do a good job of conforming to the curves of my face. It takes me about five minutes to shave according to the built in timer on the handle. The shave is much more uniform than that of the Braun 3615 that I have been using for the past few years. However, the shave is not as close. Before the Braun, I used a Norelco 5801. This model is a big improvement over the old Norelco which was slow and not very close at all.. The trade-off with respect to the Braun is one of a closer shave using the Braun vs. a more uniform shave with the new Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance:&lt;br /&gt;The clippings are collected in pockets under the shaving heads, This is an advantage in that the clippings are not scattered over the bathroom sink as they are with some electric razors. The pockets have to be cleaned out every shave or two. This is not a big problem. It only takes a few seconds. The manual indicates that the RQ10 shaving head assembly must be replaced every year. Amazon offers the RQ10 for $35. By contrast the Braun cutter and foil assembly which lasts for about one year sells on Amazon for around $24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying this product, I suggest that you search Amazon and Google for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I found that I had to replace the head assembly after 6 months. I am now using a Remington Flex 360 Rotary Shaver which has a design similiar to the Norelco but provides a faster, closer shave, and costs a lot less.</li>
    <li> sharp for a couple of shaves. expected much better than what i received. won&amp;#34; purchase another one. time to shop for a new razor.</li>
    <li> This is my second replacement head since I buy a new one every 18 months. It works fine, however it seems to be a little more loose fitting than previous units I have purchased.</li>
    <li> If your Norelco Shaver starts flashing red when you turn it off, believe me it is time to replace the RQ10 Shaving Unit.  It has cut my shaving time in half and gives a much closer shave. Even if your shaver isn&#x27;t flashing red, and you are unhappy with the shave, replace it. The old one pops off with a tug and the new one snaps in easily. Be sure to have the key way alined before you try to snap it in.</li>
    <li> I have to say this product works well and fits the razor as it should.  Had no problems getting it. I really love Amazon.com when purchasing items they always get here with no hassels.</li>
    <li> Razor needs a new head after 1-2yrs (depending on how much you use it).  I get shave BETTER than a blade with this razor.</li>
    <li> NO MORE SNAGS OR PULLS. GOT THE PART QUICK. CUTS CLEAN AND CLOSE. JUST LIKE NEW!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AGAIN FOR THE GREAT SERVICE.</li>
    <li> Hi,  When I bought the Arcitec I bought a spare replacement head.  About a year later put it in the razor what a good difference.  I knew I would want to do this again.  So when I saw the price break on Amazon, I ordered the replacement blades.  The reason I did not give 5 stars was not the product or price but the fact that I had to pay shipping even through I am a prime shipping member.  For $280/year think all shipments would be included, no matter what excuses Amazon gives. You can bet I will not be getting prime again.    GARY</li>
    <li> Once blades were replaced it is like a brand new razor.  Buying just the head saved a lot of money and accomplished the same great results</li>
    <li> The replacement product is of inferior quality. Unlike the original, the replacement is a lot rough and irritates when used. Due to lack of sharpness in the blades, takes longer time to complete a shave and leaves an unsatisfactory quality of shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last ten years with excellent results. It is a shame that you do not want to shipped to Puerto Rico as was before.</li>
    <li> one of the springs were not installed properly, had to diy and fixed it myself. Expect better quality from Philips.</li>
    <li> The product is an essential &#x27;cost-of-ownership&#x27; expense of a great razor, the Phillips Norelco Airtec shaver.  Sharp new blades keeps it working perfectly.  The seller had the product to me almost overnight at no extra cost and the pricing was reasonable.  Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads are pricey almost $60</li>
    <li> The replacement heads are easy to install. The are exceedingly sharp and restore the performance of the razor to like new. I have a coarse beard and shave daily. I need to replace razor heads about every siix months to maintain sharpness and performance.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads for the Arcitec.  They work great and my husband has had no problems with them! Delivery was fast, and we received them a few days earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Great item at a great price!!!! Overall very pleased with the transaction and the product purchased will look foward to doing business again with you in the the near future</li>
    <li> My son says his razor is like new after installing the replacement heads. I don&#x27;t think you you can get a higher recommendation than that.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the shaver head and the price I paid, also with the speedy manner in which it was shipped. When it comes time to replace it again I will return to this source for the purchase. G.M.</li>
    <li> The replacement Norelco shaving head I bought does not seem to cut very well.  The blades just don&#x27;t seem as sharp as the original blades.</li>
    <li> The head easily snap out from the razor which my OEM head did not do. Save your money - buy at your local store.</li>
    <li> Installs in a snap (pun intended), big difference from my year old blades. Worth it instead of buying a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the price and how fast that I rec&#x27;d the product. The shaver head is the same type that I have purchased in the past with other web vendors. This was the first time that I purchased thru Amazon and will now make future purchases with Amazon. Amazon&#x27;s price and speed of shipment surpassed other web vendors offering the same product!  Thanks Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTK[[ASIN:B0044IZ7SO Norelco Philips RQ10 Arcitec Replacement Heads]]</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My friend that I bought it for says \\&quot;It&#x27;s the best shave I have had in years\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the automatic shipment of new heads every 6 months. I also really like the discounted cost of the item.</li>
    <li> long over due. razor is like new.it was no longer performing any where near what it was when I bought it</li>
    <li> First Norelco RQ-10 replacement head.[[ASIN:B000PKNPES Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] Gives smooth shave-works better with electric shave lotion    You already know this if you&#x27;re getting a replacement head</li>
    <li> These were easy to replace and find information online to determine which replacement head was needed. They popped right on and off. My husband&#x27;s razor was about 1.5 years old and the razor was missing hairs around his neck. Once we replaced the blades it was having a brand new razor again.</li>
    <li> I had these within a week of ordering and am extremely satisfied with the product and their performance.  The blades made all the difference in the world.  They gave me a quick clean shave and cleaning is very simple as all you have to do is run the blades under water and it&#x27;s done.....</li>
    <li> item was what I expected I give it a 10, better grade then last year, I did;nt buy it with amazon last year</li>
    <li> I changed this after using the stock head for about three years. It still is great. I changed it thinking its too old and was not very pleased. It didnt look like it has the same quality in terms shaving easily or giving a clean shave compared to my old head. It also comes off easily from the body.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy replacement heads for electric razors. Usually by the time the heads are in need of replacement so is the rechargeable battery!! So I normally discard the old razor and buy new.  When I went to find a replacement for this razor I was surprised at the cost of the new version of this model!! Since my rechargeable battery seemed to be doing okay this was all the incentive I needed to buy the replacement heads!!  Bought these replacements and have used them now for a couple of weeks. Working like new. I did have problems early on with the head pulling off when I tried to raise the hatches to clean the razor. This has either improved or I&#x27;ve gotten better at doing it!! No longer a problem.  All things considered this was a wise choice on my part and I would recommend these replacements if your battery is still charging strongly.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my dads Norelco Philips Arctec after having no joy getting them elsewhere. They fit perfectly so he is now very happy.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Decent price. Cheaper than a new razor</li>
    <li> Just pull off the old one and snap on the new. My old head was a couple years old, what a difference. You really can&#x27;t tell how bad the old one is because it&#x27;s a gradual decline in performance. However, once you put the new one on, it&#x27;s just like having a new razor.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Wish the price was lower a bit lower...as this needs to be replaced every year and it feels like a tax</li>
    <li> These replacement heads came within a week, priced competitively as far as I could tell.  Have used them for about a month on my Arcitec 1060X, no complaints, they are noticeably sharper than my old ones.  One little caveat though: the snap-in mechanism is not as tight as I would like; the heads popped out a couple of times when I was cleaning them, easy to put back though.</li>
    <li> I am disapointed with this RQ10 Shaving replacement unit for the Norelco Arcetec razor.  I&#x27;m sorry to say that I was taken in by the fancy new design. After using the original unit for more than a year, I thought it was time for a replacement ....expecting a better shaving experience. I found it very dissapointing , performing no better than the original . In fact it never gave me a smooth shave. I finally gave up and tried my older Norelco model-Spectra 8894XL which performed to my expectations... a much smoother shave. I definitly do not recommend the replacement Unit as well as the Arcetec Norelco Razor.</li>
    <li> A necessity.  The unit is excellent.  The cover for the blade unit is fragil and easily damaged, be careful using.  The life span for these units are short. The price for the replacement unit is expensive. Norelco has now come out with the same shaver plus an extra shaving unit.  It is almost cheaper to throw away the first purchase and get a brand new shaver.</li>
    <li> If your existing razor isn&#x27;t giving you a close shave, replace the heads, NOW.  You definitely will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> We had been looking for the replacement for my husbands Norelco shaver for over a year. Went back to the place of purchase and was not able to obtain replacment heads. Was glad to have found on Amazon .com, received quickly.      My husband was glad to receive as the other option would have been to purchase a new Norelco shaver. He has used the electric shaver well over 5 years. It certainly has paid for itself. He also has sensitive skin and this does not irritate his face. Thanks and good luck.</li>
    <li> The price for the product was very good and was sent in good time. It is good to have company I can rely on for this product</li>
    <li> I would break this review into two parts.  First, the dealings with Amazon, which would rate 5 stars.  Accurate and very fast delivery and the best price anywhere around - what else can I say?    For the product itself, it did not satisfy as I had hoped.  Let me back up in time and say that about 3 years ago, I purchased a Norelco Speed XL electric shaver.  I was very happy with that shaver (as I had been with other Norelco shavers over the years).  However, after about a year, the rechargeable battery developed problems and Norelco, rather than replace the shaver with a like model, wanted to give me an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the Arcitec model.  I agreed and they sent the replacement (it was supposedly a higher priced, better shaver).  I can&#x27;t say that I have ever been totally happy with that shaver - it just doesn&#x27;t do the job.  It requires many passes over an area to get the whiskers, and if some have been missed and grown from whiskers into short hairs, forget it - get out the old Trac II razor.  As well, the trimmer on the Arcitec is all but useless.  Anyway, that aside, this review is to cover the replacement heads.  They arrived as advertised, and the one really good thing to say is that they are really easy to replace.  However, the change I had anticipated (my old head was a little over a year old) was not realized.  I am almost shocked at how little an improvement I saw (and felt).  I think if the shaver lasts to the point that I need another replacement head, I may literlly go back to the old shaving cream and razor.  Time wise, by the time I go over my face 3 or 4 times, and still don&#x27;t have a really good shave, I could do the blades and feel really smooth.</li>
    <li> super close.and super smooth shave.the icing on the cake was the great price I got from Amazon.completely satisfied as usual</li>
    <li> I expect more from a Norelco Product which is quite expensive.  Just the replacement blades are worth more than $35.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are not as good as the original. The entire unit pops off the shaver too easily (although yes, it is the correct unit). Instead of extending the life of the shaver, they have become a reason to get a new one altogether.</li>
    <li> my husband likes it for a smoothier shave,the old one was starting to pull on his skin when shaving .thanks</li>
    <li> It does what it i supposed to do.  Shave your face when you shave.  What more can i say. :-)  As good as original and is OEM quality from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> my husband really loves his razor so to be able to order the repacement heads on line is great. this razor really gets such a great  close shave.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to order this product on-line, much cheaper than the company offered, plus cheaper postage.  The product arrived in just a few days, was neatly packaged and I didn&#x27;t have to leave the comfort of my home.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver! Pros: Smooth, fast and comfortable; a real treat to use.  Cons: very expensive but this is a premium unit. You get what you pay for!! Once a year or so replacement is not bad for what you get in return. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very simple to remove existing and push on replacement head.  It was amazing how great of a shave you get with new, sharp blades.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and quick shipping,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve allways replaced the head every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never a failure.  Worked every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philipps Norelco is a exilent company and produces good shavers.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon because the cost was less than other stores. I checked the ratings of others who have purchased this item and they were satisfied with the performance.  I received the order quickly and the replacement head RQ10 has been working great. I would recommend it to others who need this part.</li>
    <li> Although I get a closer shave with my new shaving head,  the head frequently comes off the body.  This problem did not happen with the original head that I used for a couple of years daily. The quality of the replacement head is not acceptable.</li>
    <li> This is the most over priced, low quality piece of junk that I have ever used.  You can buy a complete razor for what the blades cost,  Which does a much better job.</li>
    <li> The only I have to complaine about is the price it&#x27;s way to high.the last time I bought one it was only $28 dollars thay went up almost double.</li>
    <li> I had to by replacement heads because I purchase the norelco razor. If I had a choice, next time I would buy the pansonci series.</li>
    <li> I was about to give up on my razor. It was less than a year with the original blades and it was doing a terrible job of shaving and taking a long time doing it. I got new blades and it is a new razor. Fast, and very effective. I guess I need to change the blades a lot more often than the recommended once a year.</li>
    <li> This is the entire head assembly.  I though I&#x27;d have to extract the blades and replace but this came and simply clicks on where the old one came off.  Easy and it renewed my razor to 100% original form.</li>
    <li> Works great, nothing could be easier. Just snap off the old and snap on the new heads. Shaves so much faster and closer.</li>
    <li> replacement item nad replace well. What can i say. it fits, shave, need to be clean and work good soooo</li>
    <li> Too expensive to order again</li>
    <li> Four days to cover 6000 miles from your warehouse to my country and five days for the last 70 miles. Incredible.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver for years and I just keep replacing the head on it.  Super quick and easy to replace.  I received it faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> What a difference it made. My razor shaves like it did when new. Great price and delivered on time. Will replace in 12 months.</li>
    <li> Not much can be said as one would except the  maker to put out quailty product.  If it was an after market item, a review would would be worth reading in forming an opinion.  The replacement head does what is should do, work without any problems which it does.</li>
    <li> I ordered this replacement head because the original had started to lose some of the little metal things that separate the blades, from the skin. They started to break off and when i tried to shave, this electric shaver would cut mu face. I would compare it to using a razor after a gorilla used it to shaved it&#x27;s legs. The replacement was easy to install, just pull the old one straight up and it pops right off, then simply snap in the new one. The new one is much sharper than the original and seems to give a shave as close as a blade type razor. the only complaint i have and the reason it did not get  5th star is, it does not come with a blade cover, after all they must cost $.15 or so to include.</li>
    <li> This item Norelco triple head replacement cutter RQ10.  It&#x27;s perfect and I saved $12 over Super Store prices.  Can&#x27;t be  beat.</li>
    <li> The only difference with the one that come originally with the razor is that the support is in plastic and not in metal. That differance make it disconnect the head if you use it too fast. But it happens to me just one time. So it(s ok for me. Good product and good price</li>
    <li> The only drawback to this fine electric razor is the limited life of the blades in the head.  With my heavy beard, it doesn&#x27;t last quite a year before the cutting efficiency is noticeably degraded.  The best price I&#x27;ve found anywhere for a new replacement head is right here at Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Factory new heads and they work just fine. They last about a year before I need to replace them. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT GET ANY  REPLACEMENT  HEAD&#x27;S, BUT I GOT THE  CLEANING SOLUTION, WHICH  WORKS PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt; THEY JUST AS ADVERTISED</li>
    <li> My husband seems satisfied with this replacement.  this is not the first time that he has replaced  a shaver head.</li>
    <li> My husband has had his razor for many years this is a very good product, in my opinion. Shaves clean and close.</li>
    <li> Fits my razor perfectly.  Clark Howard suggests cleaning your wet blade shaver with water and then drying it completely to make the blade last for months. I&#x27;ve found one better: Clean these heads only with compressed air (PC canned air) and they will last 4 years of daily use!  Mine do.</li>
    <li> This product reacts like it has been used for more than a year.  i was inefficient at the start and is only getting worse.  I both a second head as a back up and it is just as useless.</li>
    <li> Correct replacement and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have been replacing these heads for about 5 years.  Some stores do not carry the RQ10 replacements and Amazon made this simple.  As far as performance (sharpness and durability), this replacement is basically the same as the original.  The head lasts a bit more than 12 months (I replaced the first one at 12 months, than a month or so later the light came on to replace the head, so it is based on a simple timer).  Since then I routinely have to light turn on every 12 - 14 months (14 months is when I shaved less due to growing a beard).  I hope Norelco keeps making these replacement heads.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and each time the product came within 2 days. It has extended the life of my razor for over 3 years now!</li>
    <li> This replacement does not feel as comfortable while shaving or shave as close as the original shaving head. I know amazon said they were having trouble with this model and were not selling it for a while. I thought that when they said it was available again it would be good. It is ok but not great.</li>
    <li> This replaceent part does not fit tight. Falls out. The original still locks in tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves good but tend to fall out during cleaning.</li>
    <li> After 4 years of using the original head this one works 10 times faster. Should have replaced sooner. That and I think the replacement head was better than the one that came with the razor.</li>
    <li> I have been a Philishave user from my first electric razor purchase as a teenager, and have stuck with Philips products, including my retirement gift of a Philips Arcitec.  It never seemed to shave as well as other Philips razors.  The replacement head from Amazon did not solve the problem.  It does not attach properly. What a disappointment. Hello landfill for Philishave.  I may be a late switcher, but next time Remington, Braun, or whatever actually stays in one piece! I feel one part disappointed at what used to be a great brand, plus one part ripped off.  Advice to anyone else.  Try before you buy.  Present products do not measure up to former products that did not have tilting heads, etc</li>
    <li> I have replaced this head twice.  The first time was from old age, the second was because my husband left it where my little puppies could reach it and they chewed the head off, and destroyed it.  Ordering through Amazon, I was able to get a great price and received it quickly using regular mail service.  My husband snapped it on and the razor worked like new again.  Both times, I tried to find this replacement head in the local stores and couldn&#x27;t find it.  My husband loves this Norelco product, awesome razor!</li>
    <li> Rejuvenated my favorite shaver and saved many dollars that I was expecting to spend on a replacement shaver (most that I looked at were of inferior quality to my old shaver so the new heads gave it new life.</li>
    <li> The phillips norelco replacement  RQ10 is just as good or better than the original. It seems to be holding up better than the original.</li>
    <li> The razor head I received is not much better than the old one I replaced.  It has a dull feel when shavin.</li>
    <li> Works great. That&#x27;s all I really have to say, but Amazon is asking for more words. Let&#x27;s see... I love it too!</li>
    <li> The head are designed to wear out after a couple of months so the profit is made by having to continue to have to purchase the replacement heads.  The head work great for about the first month and then it take a lot of work to get a close shave.  I would not recommend getting a razor that requires this type of head.</li>
    <li> Amazon sell this for about half what phillips/norelco website sells it for.    Great deal if you own a Arcitec shaver</li>
    <li> I replace the shaving head every year. Those who don&#x27;t have a heavy beard can go much longer than that.</li>
    <li> Easy replacement, new blades make your shaver like new.  Blades snap into place, no tools required, works like new afterwards.</li>
    <li> My advice to anyone that uses this shaver -  Replace the heads as soon as any visible wear occurs.  Otherwise you can get many small cuts you won&#x27;t notice at first but will progressively worsen.</li>
    <li> It was a perfect fit and an easy replacement.  Next time I will try this again.  I wish I could just replace the blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Philips/Norelco shavers for 40 years, most recently the RQ10.  This razor works great for me, and replacing the heads each year has ensured close, comfortable shaves for more than five years.  I like the way Philips keeps its past models in production and provides new heads.  Why have to switch if you&#x27;re happy with the razor you have?  (I&#x27;m probably imagining this, but I thought this year&#x27;s heads gave me an even closer, faster shave.  Maybe it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re new.)</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered.  Works perfect.  This saved me from having to purchase another razor which I had no intentions of doing....  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite annoying to need to replace the shaver head once a year. Also, I still need to use the normal/classic gillette to finish up my shaving. It&#x27;s the third head I use (I owe the shaver since late 2009), and the only reason I still buy them is because I wouldn&#x27;t buy another shaver –yet.</li>
    <li> My husband has me order the new replacement heads for his Norelco razor at least once a year.  He really likes them and they are easy to order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads arrived ahead of the estimated delivery date and are working perfectly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ,just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Works well, fits perfectly, sharper cutters, do the job much better. Now must see how long this head will last.</li>
    <li> These heads last about 6 months before they need replacing. When you get a new one it shaves like a dream for about a month, then it starts to take longer and longer to get a clean shave. By 6 months I hate the doggoned thing, and I order a new one. The price of a new head is fair enough.</li>
    <li> I like my Norelco shaver and probably will never go back to wet shaving again. I read reviews where guys changed the blades annually. I&#x27;m no &amp;#34;burly bearded guy&amp;#34; guy but I need to change every 6 months. Around 6 months I start really pressing the razor against my face. This in turn makes the shave uneven and I miss spots because the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough. You one year guys are either buying different blades, are cheap or you have little to no facial hair growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had about 3 of these in the past and they often take a few weeks to get bedded in. For some reason this one is not cutting as good as my old one which I had for 1 year. Maybe a different manufacturer or cheaper material specification. Not overly impressed so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought all my husband&#x27;s shaver heads on Amazon.  They work well and come at a much better price than in the stores.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco RQ10 Replacement Head arrived so quickly my husband didn&#x27;t have the chance to grow the beard he was contemplating&lt;br /&gt;as an alternative to shaving.  Thank you .</li>
    <li> My husband loves these, we reorder them often.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smooth feel he gets.&lt;br /&gt;we both smile!&lt;br /&gt;great product.</li>
    <li> Simply stated this item fit well and functions well. No problems with compatibility with my razor. I would certainly purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Am very pleased with these original replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco makes an excellent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;This was the best price for this item.</li>
    <li> I get this product every year as per Norelco&#x27;s advice.  Nothing to rave about or complain.  It is the only replacement head available and is made by the shaver manufacturer.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the original that the machine came with. The opening system for cleaning is not great either, prone to breakage.</li>
    <li> This replaced two year old blades and as I expected, it took about two weeks to break them in. They now perform much better than the old blades and I am glad I replaced the old ones. I now keep the old blades as a spare.</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all. I have giving up on finding a replacement</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s razor and it did make such a difference in his shave. He didn&#x27;t realize that his needed replacement until he received this.  I am so grateful for Amazon because we couldn&#x27;t find a replacement no where around here.  So from now on I will always check Amazon for what I need,  Thank you Amazon  !!</li>
    <li> These blades last a while... but I want ones that last longer or are lower in price. If they were lower in price I&#x27;d be more likely to buy more frequently.</li>
    <li> My husband always gets his replacement shaver heads here and is never disappointed. Shaver is just like new! Sure beats buying a new shaver...</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this product except for the fact that it works and keeps an expensive electric razor running like new.  I have owned Norelco and Braun razors for the last 25 years and the current Norelco is the best yet.  This kit has kept it running in top shape.</li>
    <li> standard replacement. The heads are good and provides an OEM product. I would recommend using the cleaning spray on them to extend life.</li>
    <li> my face is thanking the philips norelco rq10 replacement heads,absolutely works great, love amazons retailers! lov it,lov it love it</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco for years, but in the last 2 years the replacement heads have gone from not so sharp to very dull right out the new package, I have changed to another brand.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and I would recommend it to anybody. It is easy on the face easy to install and remove. Also with auto delivery there is no worry on when to replace it, you just tell how often that you want it delivered and they take care of the rest. I have owned this product for 6 years And have never found anything wrong with it.</li>
    <li> What I needed ...What I got...</li>
    <li> Pricey replacement part.</li>
    <li> Before Phillips bought Norelco the blades lasted for years and years and you put new blades in the same housing.  Now the head wears out in about 14 months and cost about $50.00.  Phillips is the master of planned obsoleteness. Before they bought Sonicare the brushes were replaced every 6 months.  Now the have to be replaced every 3 months.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Price is right. No issues. Fits perfect. Don&#x27;t know what else to say, happy 4th of july.</li>
    <li> Little expensive, but I needed it badly</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s dad needed a replacement head for his Norelco; so we purhased this one.  It&#x27;s an exact replacement for the old shaving head; now his Norelco works like new!</li>
    <li> I received the product in less than a week after I ordered it.  It was exactly as described and displayed on amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten these yet, but they are replacement heads for my Norelco Arcitec, and I&#x27;m sure they will be perfect.</li>
    <li> EXPENSIVE, BUT GIVE A GOOD SHAVE.   THEY ARE THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN FOR THE NORELCO THOUGH......</li>
    <li> I still love the Norelco Arcitec razor, however these after-market replacement heads are junk. The plastic lip that holds them on the body fail in a month or so. I&#x27;ll buy one more than start looking for a higher quality/reliable razor. I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for 40 years. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed w/replacement shaving unit. Could not get as good a shave as my old unit. I assumed these were new and if not, would like to return them!</li>
    <li> The Norelco quality inspector must have been on coffee break when my replacement shaving head went through his/her work station because one of the three detent springs that are intended to hold the shaving head upright during cleaning was improperly installed and thus does not hold the head upright during cleaning.  You&#x27;d think that if I can notice this manufacturing error, the Norelco inspector could, too.  It doesn&#x27;t affect actual shaving, but makes cleaning the heads afeter every shave (as required)a problem.  [[ASIN:B000UK16AI Philips Norelco RQ10 Shaving Unit]]</li>
    <li> Replacement head fits and works exactly like the original. However, I have never been able to get as close a shave with the arcitec razor as I used to get with my old Philips razors. i guess it is just the nature of the beast,</li>
    <li> Cheap replacement by Norelco!! Not anywhere near as good as the original equipment. If a new razor wasn&#x27;t so expensive I would just go out and get one. Norelco really dropped the ball on this one.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd replacement head purchased... The original and 1st replacement each lasted 1 year before needing to be replaced. My facial hair grows quickly and is fairly thick so, I feel like for the heads to last a year they are made well.</li>
    <li> great while they&#x27;re new, however they tend to wear out fast so i end up having to change heads every 6-8 months although I only shave twice a week.</li>
    <li> price was right and delivered on time</li>
    <li> Makes the old razor work like new again</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the shave from this head.  It wasn&#x27;t as sharp as the original head.  It made me think it might have been a knock-off of the Norelco brand.</li>
    <li> I paid $45 for this, started using it 10-1 and after FOUR months my face is burning!!  It&#x27;s supposed to last a year - - grrr</li>
    <li> very good price and arrived quickly. shaver works better than ever. shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long before replacing head. changing heads was easier than i thought.</li>
    <li> Super sharp head that may need to be replaced once a year!  Works well to easily shave and exfoliates the skin!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver and with subscribe and save he gets new blades when he should be replacing them.  The service is great  and so are the blades.</li>
    <li> These Norelco replacement heads will bring the cutting performance back to your old razor and get it back shaving like it did when it was new. new.</li>
    <li> My first replacement after having had this shaver and used it daily for 6 years! Amazing quality.</li>
    <li> My shaver is many years old and its the first time I change the head. What a difference! It&#x27;s like a new one.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the price I paid was pretty good and Amazon&#x27;s service was perfect. Thank you very much! Ernest</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco razors for over thirty years and found this to be the best one yet.  Would not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Having had this electric razer for 25 to 30 yrs. and it works just like it did new, I am well pleased. thank you,  Jim Nelson</li>
    <li> it rejuvenates the shaver and makes for effortless shaving. Replacing the head once every year to a year and half is worh the money.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as describe and was delivered on time. It fit my shaver perfectly and I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> The replacement head fits perfectly.  It&#x27;s a great shave.  I appreciate everybody&#x27;s recommendations for the product replacement.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> The RQ10 is more expensive than other models but I I hadn&#x27;t replaced the head in over 3 years so I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> After using my shaver for approximately two years a light on the body of the shaver told me I should replace the shaver head. I fortunately found it at Amazon ordered it, installed it easily (snaps on and off entire head).  WOW what a difference, Norelco seems to have made an improvement in the entire head.  Shaver is better than new.  Order this head you will not be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> At one year the Norelco heads need changing. Like shaving with a new razor now.</li>
    <li> This RQ10 Norelco electric shaver unit; which I ordered here from Amazon.com, fit exactly as it should into my Arcitec shaver. Also, I was very glad to find it here. Last year, my local Target store had them in stock, but not this year. I have become quite accustom to the happy reality, that Amazon is a terrific place to find what I need, when local retailers do not.</li>
    <li> This is what the Norelco razor requires. I have replaced this part previously and have had very good results with it.</li>
    <li> I probably use the shaving heads too long, and it was good to get a new one on my shaver. Shaving goes quicker and with less skin irritation. The price seemed a little steep until I found that the whole head is replaced with all the gears, etc. When you amortize the price over the life of the head, it&#x27;s not much per month.</li>
    <li> Love my Norelco, especially how long a charge lasts.  So I was delighted when a friend said he had the same razor and he told me I could find replacement heads at Amazon.  It&#x27;s great to have it running like new again.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t have found a better deal anywhere . . . and the key work is &amp;#34;found.&amp;#34;  I looked everywhere for them and finally found them on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I was extremely delighted with the ordering process, delivery, and service.  Easy and uncomplicated.  However, I wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown away my old shaver head away as it worked better in it&#x27;s one year old worn out condition than the brand new replacement that just does not work as well as the original or the original that was used probably 400 times.  I&#x27;ve given it more than the breaking in period and it just dies not work as well as the one I discarded upon receipt of the new one.  My mistake, but this replacement just doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  H. Thomas</li>
    <li> I always replace the shaver heads when the light comes on the display. It&#x27;s the only way to get a decent shave from an electric. Also, I use the Norelco Spray Lubricant one a week.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000UK16AI Philips Norelco RQ10 Shaving Unit]]  What a surprise when I got my RQ 10 head and saw that it came without any identification from NORELCO as it is shown in the site. Despite it came in a transparent blister with no identification, I openned it and placed in my ARCITEC 1050, but at the very first shave, the head started to fall apart from the razor! I just can&#x27;t shave myself because the head falls all the time. The razor head looks very similar to the old one, except for its neck that is black as the old one is metalic.  My first impression is that this new head has its neck diameter a bit smaller than the old one. Considering this issue, I wonder if the new replacement head sold by Amazon is a genuine NORELCO part or a chinese generic one. And now, what can I do? just accept it and loose my 30 bucks?</li>
    <li> Exact replacement part.</li>
    <li> With the 5 dollar couple it was around half price. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, thanks for the free shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting about a year out of these, but every time I replace I think I should do it sooner.</li>
    <li> item as needed is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert wells</li>
    <li> Replaced head for my razor. Just wish that they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I should replace these more often. I last changed the head on my Norelco 11 months ago.  When the blades slowly go dull you don&#x27;t notice until you put the new replacement head on.  All of sudden you are shaving in half the time, twice as close. Probably should replace every 4 months or sooner.</li>
    <li> The new blades just pop on and back to shaving like it did when it was new.  Wish they lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Not the same like the first that come with the machine, but is very ok. Work and fit very well.</li>
    <li> The product meets high standards  it provide a renewed excellence to the shaver .Norelco. And Phillips  Produce a wonderful shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Shaver heads were received promptly, and were in perfect condition. would recommend this  item for replacement of heads. Price was very good.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, kind to your legs and gets the hair off in a reasonable time. I wouldn&#x27;t use a razor again.</li>
    <li> Extremely fast shipment.  Head fits and performs like original!</li>
    <li> I shave every day with it.It gives a good shave but I wish there were a way to clean it with a brush.</li>
    <li> I have two Norelco shavers the 8240XL and 1060X,(These Blades) The cheaper 8240XL is a much better and cheaper one.</li>
    <li> perfect fit.  good price.  works like new.  that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
    <li> He is very happy with the new replacement heads.  He didn&#x27;t realize how badly he needed them.</li>
    <li> Razor had been too dull so I went online and found this replacement that was much cheaper than in the store. Replacement heads fit perfect and now I am able to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> These heads are as good or better than the one&#x27;s that come on your shaver when it is new.I really think their the same one&#x27;s.I have had these for two weeks and I can&#x27;t tell any difference accept their sharper than my old set cutting shaving time down.I cut shaving time with this new set almost in half,guess my old set was queit dull.These new one&#x27;s close and lock up tighter also.If you are thinking about getting a new set do it.These will make your razer like new again.</li>
    <li> Easy to install works well razor works like new, highly recommended, changing head easy,it is like getting  a new razor.</li>
    <li> Have had this razor for about 5 years now.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for at least 30 years and they have always worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked to find the price increase went from $34 to 46 in one year.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of the Arcitec line of Norelco Razors.  The heads seem difficult to clean and flimsy.  I was never able to get a nice close shave, so I bought the replacement head to see if that might be the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive, you just pull the old razor head off and put the new razor head on.  Sounds painful, but really simple.  You just grab the razor head in one hand, the razor in the other and give a firm yank.  The head pops right off.  You then just line up the new head and push it into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a negative, the heads are relatively expensive and about the 1/4 the cost of a new Norelco electric razor.  I shaved with the new head and my shave was marginally better.  I don&#x27;t think I have titanium stubble and I&#x27;m certainly not related to the &amp;#34;Man of Steel&amp;#34;, so I can only assume that the razor does not do as nice a job or gives as close a shave as I would have expected.</li>
    <li> The old head I had had one of the blades stop working so I finally replaced it.  What a difference!</li>
    <li> Excellet Purchase!!  This replacement head works really well and actually stay on the razor without falling off.</li>
    <li> Shave is not as close as I would have hoped.  Previous one lasted less than one year.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> An authentic Phillips Norelco product for a good price.</li>
    <li> The head itself is good, but I would not recommend this shaver.  You can&#x27;t clean the head sufficiently well, that is the reason the head needs to be replaced on an annual basis.  With the older design, the head can be completely taken apart and cleaned, enabling the blades and head to operating properly for a longer period of time.  Also, the pop-up beard cutter on the shaver is tinny compared to the more robust feeling older design.  In the future I am going to buy the older design shaver.  I think Norelco is marketing this new design because they like the recurring sales for the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Sadly, the first order of this product was lost in the mail.  But, you never know about a company until there is a problem.  Amazon said fine, we&#x27;ll ship another with no charge.  And boom, it got her the next day!  This product have given me the equivalent of a new razor.  I had the original blades for several years.  There is a huge difference when you get new blades.  My face is now baby soft and smooth!  yessss!  thanks.</li>
    <li> Very good product and my husband enjoys his Philips Norelco razor and changes the head every 10 months as suggested.</li>
    <li> Somewhere between 6 months to a year after purchasing a Norelco Arcitec razor the shaving quality and speed went away. The purchase of a RQ10 replacement head makes it shave like new again. And Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be beat! I checked.</li>
    <li> I try to replace my Norelco Arcitec electric razor blades (RQ10) every year.  I usually find them at one of several large department stores, but no one had them this year.  So I decided to try Amazon.com.  Not only were they available, but at a much better price than I had found anywhere!  It seems I can almost always find what I need online through Amazon.com.  Checkout was easy and shipping was fast.  Thank you Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> This is my 5th head change for my shaver.  It works like new, and I will use this shaver for at least another year.</li>
    <li> As far as electric razor heads go, this one does the job well.  With regular cleaning it will last at least a year.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver for almost 5 years now and have replaced the head four times - I haven&#x27;t had one break down on me yet.</li>
    <li> I have had my Norelco Arcitec 1050X for three years and am just now changing the razor head for the first time. One of the best features is the long battery life. A full charge still lasts me over an entire month of use before recharging. I also use it several minutes each day. I definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I ordered these mindful of some negative reviews which showed some users had problems with these units popping off the shaver since the mounting collar has been cheaped out to plastic from the original metal.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those who has had zero issues with that; mine stays put just fine. The Norelco it&#x27;s mounted on still has great battery life and so it&#x27;s like getting a new shaver for $40. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The razor was dropped by the &amp;#34;little one&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;New head not available in a local store.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to order---received quickly---easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;A clean shave once again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> My husband is thrilled.  He thought he would have to buy a new razor for $200+.  Instead he bought a new head and his razor is like new.</li>
    <li> Works great! It makes my shaver seem brand new again!</li>
    <li> It seems like evry time I order replacement heads for my razor that the quality has gone down. I love my razor, but I am considering buying a cheaper one where the trplacement heads aren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> These shaver heads are genuine Phillips Norelco units.  I shave once a day and they last one year based upon using them for the past five years.  I use a preshave to remove skin moisture and provide lubrication.  I also spray the heads each morning with a short burst of razor spray lubricant.  Once a month I wash the head in a small bowl of shallow hot water, one inch deep, with some dish washing detergent while the head is running to remove built up oil, hair, and grease.  After removing the head from the razor, I hot rinse the head and leave it to dry.  After drying I spray the inside of the head with razor spray before using the head for shaving.</li>
    <li> Okay, so my husband bought this RQ10 when it first came out and the blades seemed like they lasted at least 6 months.  The first replacement blades - maybe as long.  Every replacement blade after that - hardly a month.  Could it be because the newest, latest and greatest model came out and hmmmmm, maybe they&#x27;d like you to buy one??!!  Why is it that these blades don&#x27;t last as long anymore?  I guess we&#x27;ll be following the herd and buying a new one.  &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> i have order this item for the last 2 or 3 years always been like a new razer.but this year not so, no better than the old one i was replaceing.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement heads.  Work fine and less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the second replacement head for my razor. The blades cut close and are the same as the original ones. If you have an expensive razor the purchase of replacement heads will make it well worth the money.</li>
    <li> received quickly works great</li>
    <li> The replacement head fails to provide the shave I&#x27;ve grown to expect from a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my very first shave, it performed like it had been used everyday for 3-6 months already.</li>
    <li> Good service and product</li>
    <li> Had not replaced my blades in a couple of years so they made a huge difference.  I kept my box, dated it.......maybe this will help me to replace them each year or so.</li>
    <li> excellent replacement head</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it is exactly like the original.  I recommend this replacement head for all users of compatible Phillips Norelco electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the fourth year I have used my Norelco electric shaver and I replace the head every year as recommended by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the replacement razor head. The replacement head provides a close shave and you will not notice any difference from the original head that comes with the razor. Good purchase for the money.</li>
    <li> replacement head May 2012. At 4 months (September) one of the cutters stopped working. Now using razor with 2 cutters.  In December another cutter quit working.  I am not willing to replace head and will junk razor.</li>
    <li> I go through these replacement heads faster than most men because I use my electric razor to shave my face AND my entire head.  The titanium blades hold their sharpness for about 3-4 months max, but that is still pretty good!</li>
    <li> I just renewed my Norelco shaver for another five years</li>
    <li> rq10 works like new----- just like A NEW RAZER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads for my razor.  It was the right size and they last a long time!  Will definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco razor for years.  I like to alternate between it and a blade.  I generally replace the RQ10 Head once a year.  It does a great job for an electric razor.  The best price I found was on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Pop off the old and pop on the new, closest shave in a long time.  The blades decay slowly overtime and so you don&#x27;t really notice the delcine in shave quality, till you pop on a set of new blades...what a difference.  I change mine once a year now!</li>
    <li> This is the second replacement head I have bought. The original was fantastic! The first replacement head didn&#x27;t last 1/2 as long as the original. It also felt like something pointy sharp was sticking me, although it never drew blood. These cannot be brand new, they must be refurbished, I think. So far so good with the second one, at least nothing&#x27;s sticking me. I&#x27;ll review again in 3 or 4 mos.</li>
    <li> The head for this razor is a bit expensive but when you realize it is the complete head and not just the blades I guess the cost is understandable. It is very easy yo replace.</li>
    <li> The Norelco Architect razor is an excellent device.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the replacement head I recently ordered was to replace the other head that locked up after only three months of use.  If that happens again I will buy another brand of razor.</li>
    <li> Received  my RQ-10  a few day&#x27;s after I ordered it.  The unit came in a well protected  box with internal  protection. The price was great and  the service  wonderful.  I have not  had to install this unit yet, but the previous unit I ordered was installed. The difference in the smoothness of the shave  was noticed immediately.  And since I have elected to receive a new unit  every three months I expect to receive close comfortable  shaves  for as long as the use the razor.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with the Norelco Arcitec for two years, this is the first replacement unit I&#x27;ve installed.  It gives me a smooth shave and no razor burn, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this razor.</li>
    <li> This gives me a good, easy, close shave and simple to clean. I actually get a closer shave than with a blade.</li>
    <li> No big improvement in closeness of shave over the old head. Time for rotary head shavers to improve the quality of shave.</li>
    <li> I have just kept it and maybe use it as an xmas gift for a family member.  Thought you would like to know&#x27;</li>
    <li> my replacement blades just don&#x27;t feel right can&#x27;t get a good shave with my new blades I have been shaving with Norelco for 52 yrs and I this the first time I&#x27;m unhappy with my blades</li>
    <li> this was a great price and just like one that you find in a local store but a lower price. Works great and would buy this again. These will only last about 11 months, it does make a huge difference replacing the head.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY 2ND PURCHASE OF THIS ITEM, I BUY A NEW ONE ABOUT EVERY YEAR.  I WILL ORDER ANOTHER ONE.  COMES AS PROMISED, FAST AND EASY.</li>
    <li> what i needed, sorry i am not a wordy person that goes on and on and on and on and on</li>
    <li> Red replace light remains on after it is replaced.  Had to call Philips to find out that its normal for the first couple of shaves.</li>
    <li> My Norelco razor was not shaving very well.  You can&#x27;t sharpen the blades.  I bought the replacement head and it works like new now.</li>
    <li> Pricier than I would expect but I quess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than a years supply of safety razor blades and just as clean a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the convenience of being to shave pretty much anywhere.</li>
    <li> I like my Norelco shaver which I&#x27;ve now had for years.  The heads do need to be replaced periodically and my new one works much better than the old &amp;#34;worn out&amp;#34; one.  The RQ10s are not always easy to find, but Amazon comes through again!</li>
    <li> Nice replace head. Works great. It gives your razor a new life.</li>
    <li> Been 4 years since I replaced my shaver head, never again. 35.00 investment completely changed my shaving experiance for 2014....</li>
    <li> What can you say about a new shaver head? It is sharper that my old one, and it certainly shaves better. Will order another replacement in about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. no big deal just a replacement</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Not a very good shaver head, my opinion is the Architec is not a great shaver.  I have other Norelco shavers (older and simpler) providing better and closer shaves.</li>
    <li> poor quality, plastic, and low grade cutters</li>
    <li> It is pretty easy to replace the old shaving head, snap off, snap on, and the quality of the shave is much improved with new blades. The only drawback is the rather hefty price of replacing a whole unit instead of just the blades.</li>
    <li> the product was well described and it was exactly what i was looking for. it fits the shaver i have been using for several years now. it was cheaper than what some stores near me were selling it for. and it was delivered without hassle. so, overall, ordering this product via amazon was a thoroughly satisfying experience.</li>
    <li> Finally decided to get a new set as the old one that I used for over a year now. New set of blades do make a difference and the razor is back to its original condition as the day I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Quality is same as the original, close cutting edge. I would definitely advise a new set every year, as six months replacement would be an over kill, since these are not cheap even for the toughest beards.&lt;br /&gt;Shop around for the best price though!&lt;br /&gt;The replacements are still Made in the Netherlands, so they are not the cheap quality replacements made in Asia, so I say are no compromises just the best for my beard.</li>
    <li> I have looked many places, including our Air Force Base.  No body has a better price than here.  Heads last about 3-4 months with my tough beard.</li>
    <li> Genuine replacement head, pricey, but works pretty well!</li>
    <li> My husband likes his norelco shaver and I have purchased two sets of replacement shaving heads, the service is rapid and the product meets our needs, thank you</li>
    <li> It meets all expections</li>
    <li> It was exactly what we wanted and came very fast</li>
    <li> On the advertised, great service.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> They raised the price and say they don&#x27;t make any more. This is the best dry shaver made I think. It sure fits my face better than Sensor Touch or other raisers. Stays sharp longer and shaves closer and much faster. I have used it for at least 40 years,Buy a new head ever year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Stipe</li>
    <li> It is hard to find these in a store.  What a pleasure it is to just sit with your laptop and order it then have it at your door 2 days later and use it immediately.  Shaves very well.</li>
    <li> Good price and shipped fast</li>
    <li> This product came on time with no problems. There is not much margin for error when matching the model with the product, so of course the worked well in the razor. I will be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> quick shipment great product works as described will use again, try it will you!!</li>
    <li> Not very sharp, if you have a tough beard/stubble like me then don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement and a quality shave every time!</li>
    <li> does not cut like the orginal head</li>
    <li> It does what you expect it to do.  But the last head was dull in 6 months.  $52 every 6 months is too expensive.  The heads cannot be removed for sharpening.  I am now using a two head battery powere travel shaver that I could sharpened.  Won&#x27;t buy another 3 head replacement.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly into the Norelco shaver. Easy to install. Does a great job of cutting stubble whiskers. Tunes up an old Norelco to perform again like new.</li>
    <li> IN MY OPINION THE ARCITEC SERIES IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE. YOU MUST GO OVER AND OVER. DOES NOT DO A GOOD JOB. YOU HAVE TO DO THE WORK TO GET IT TO WORK, THEN YOU STILL MIGHT WANT TO SHAVE IT OVER WITH RAZOR. IT&#x27;S A PITY.</li>
    <li> This is like having a new razor, just snap out the old and snap in the new head. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The price was better than I could find anywhere else.  The quality was equal to the original head that came originally with my razor.</li>
    <li> I have a very tough beard &amp; a replacement head only lasts me about 8 months.  This is my 3rd replacement head &amp; this one seems to cut closer than the previous ones.  My razor still runs fine, still cheaper than buying a comparable new razor.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten how comfortable this razor had been brand new until I replaced the blade.  No more sore skin!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I waited too long to get a new one.  It sure gives a better shave!  Keep track of when a year is up...get a new replacement head at once.</li>
    <li> Super price for this product</li>
    <li> It gives a close and fast shave, but it easily dislodges from shaver body if some pressure is applied to the shaver to get a closer shave, or even when the cutters are being cleaned with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;Reshaping of the spring holding slots on the shaver unit would overcome the problem</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with his shaving unit replacement head.  It does the job, and he wishes he had replaced it sooner.  He had searched a number of stores and was unable to find  this product.  Suddenly we thought of Amazon and were pleasantly surprised to find just what we wanted.</li>
    <li> The replacement head works like the razor is new again.  The only problem is the high price of the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> New blades make razor sing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor gor 5 years and this is the third time I&#x27;ve replaced the head.  It&#x27;s like shaving with a new razor.</li>
    <li> Good price *****fairly fast delivery****</li>
    <li> not like the first one</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shaving heads for a very long time,and they always give me a great shave,and I try to buy my new blades at Amazon.com because they have good prices on this product.</li>
    <li> My husband has owned this razor for 6 years now and loves it.  When replacement heads are needed we always purchase through Amazon due to the great pricing.  The replacement blades make the shaver feel and perform like new.  Would definitely recommend this product.  And as always, Amazon shipping and pricing can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> After close examination I found that the new head I received did not have the metal jacket around the base where it inserts into the razor,causing it to continually pop out while shaving ![[ASIN:B000UK16AI Philips Norelco Replacement Head RQ10/00]]</li>
    <li> Razor is 4 years old, replacement blades make it like new again.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as expected.  Worked perfectly. Exact duplicate of the original head on the razor.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I like how this works but I would like it would be easier to clean it. You can not unasambly totally and this make it more difficult.</li>
    <li> The web site had a helpful visual guide to identify the required shaving head. It arrived on time, was easy to replace, and worked just fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original head on my shaver lasted at least 8 years. I have now had 2 replacement heads, neither one of which lasted more than 6 months or so. I have a very light beard. Forced to go back to using a regular razor, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that electric razors are not worth the money, unless your have such a heavy beard that you need to shave again during the day when you are away from home. Inexpensive disposable razors give the closest shave at all, with little more effort or time, allowing me to shave every other day, if I wish. I am not replacing this Norelco shaver head for the third time.</li>
    <li> Made my Norelco perform like new.  Very satisfied with replacement head.  Everything about the order was great including price and delivery when promised.</li>
    <li> Great buy for this product.  Gives such a close shave.  Definitely would recommend this product to others.  Such a great deal.</li>
    <li> I expected these blades to be nice and sharp.  Unfortunately the new blades pluck the hairs from my face. OUCH.</li>
    <li> I have had very disappointing life with these heads so far. I have been buying replacements on Ebay. So far I have been surprised that these are as sharp and efficient as the day I bought them.</li>
    <li> philips norelco rq10 replacement head very good...&lt;br /&gt;philips norelco rq10 replacement head very good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i usually this goods...very nice philips replacement head</li>
    <li> I have had the Arcitec 1090 for over 3 years and replaced the shaver head 6 times so far. I love the razor and the shave BUT the last 2 replacement heads have not fit as well into the body of the razor (whether cheaper materials or changing specs) and have tended to fall out at my normal shaving pressure. I saved one of the early heads as an emergency replacement and do not have this problem with this shaver head. When I got the first head that had this problem, I asked Amazon to replace it and they did without problem. The issue remains with the new shaver head and I have had to change my shaving pressure, resulting in about an extra 45 sec - 1 min of shave time.</li>
    <li> I received my new Norelco replacement head today. Didn&#x27;t realize how bad my original head had gotten. Until I used the new head. Boy what a difference. Best move I could have made and at a very reasonable price. I am ordering a second head today, so I have an extra on hand when the new one wears out. Plus no telling how much more a head will cost in the future. Also ordered a new head for my father - in - law. He got his Norelco Arctic razor about the same time I got mine. So I know his razor head has to be as bad as mine was.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement head to make razor like new again and the price was even better. Easy to find and quick to ship with Amazon Prime. Much better than finding this needle in the haystack at retail stores or paying full retail from manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old head and decided to buy replacement head at AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered on time, and so far, new head works perfectly. Nice and smooth shaving.</li>
    <li> Our local stores had discontinued carrying these replacement heads. My husband was thrilled to be able to continue using his beloved tried and true electric shaver. Thanks for providing it in your inventory.</li>
    <li> Replacing the heads once every year is cheaper than buying a new shaver every few years.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product performed as expected.</li>
    <li> quite satisfactory, thanks kindly</li>
    <li> Very close shave for my husband. He is very happy with it</li>
    <li> I think they are very good.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Norelco Arcitec for more than a year. After daily use, the shaver head started messing up and come to find out (after experiencing the NEW head) it was actually pretty dull. I purchased this product to replace my old razor head and I am more than satisfied with it. Based on other people&#x27;s reviews I expected less. After receiving the new head and trying it out, I can tell you the razor is sharp and VERY smooth. This replacement head makes your razor feel like new again. The way it feels compared to my old one and how smooth it is is awesome! It&#x27;s top of the line just like the original. It&#x27;s a great product and I definitely recommended to everyone. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disapointed with the shaver. I decided to buy it afer reviewing the ratings and to be sure, it made sense with the head able to adjust to the contours of your face. However, my older Norelco shaver gave me a closer shave in less time than the new one.</li>
    <li> The replacement head made the razor like new. So glad one still fit since have had the razor for some years. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I got what I hoped to get; a new replacement head.  Clean with alcohol every so often and you will maintain higher performance.  With free shipping, the cost was best around.</li>
    <li> Came on time, fit my razor, cuts my beard.  all good.  nine, nine, nine, nine nine nine nine nine nine</li>
    <li> My husband got his Arcitec in 2011 for Christmas and needed a new head. This is a good product and a good buy. Worth the purchase amount.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and replace, even though quite expensive. The quality of the blades though is very good and they are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit no issues. Delivered as promised!</li>
    <li> Still cutting well after 6 months of use.</li>
    <li> Buy at least every 8 months for husband&#x27;s Norelco razor - just what he wants and works very well.</li>
    <li> excellent  and very quickly filled</li>
    <li> Fits my Norelco Arcitec perfectly and it arrived incredibly quickly (next day).</li>
    <li> Quick and easily put in place and very quick delivery through Amazon whose price was better than local stores.  Razor performance stayed consistent without a noticeable improvement in cutting.</li>
    <li> I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER.  I SPENT A BUNDLE OF CASH FOR THE UNIT AND IT NEVER SHAVED WELL. I FIGURED THE SHAVING HEAD WASN&#x27;T GOOD SO, FOOLISHLY, I BOUGHT A REPLACEMENT HEAD.  IT DOESN&#x27;T DO ANY BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL.  ALL GOOD MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN.  I RECOMMEND GILLETTE (WITH THE SHARPEST EDGES EVER HONED).</li>
    <li> It is definitely worth following the recommendation to replace them every 12 months, and good value compared to buying locally in Australia.</li>
    <li> My dad couldn&#x27;t wait to get this replacement.  When I called that the replacement came in. Thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> The RQ10 Shaving Unit is manufactured with typical Philips Norelco quality.  It is a precision item that produces an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> I recommend to buy this item because work very properly  and your cost is not expensive , and come very soon.</li>
    <li> Norelco recommends that every year you should replace the head and for good reason. No matter how fine your hair is the blades still get dull from slicing against each other, metal against metal, every single day. Don&#x27;t wait, not only do you get a faster smoother shave, you also save strain on the motor, which means a longer overall life for your razor!</li>
    <li> I bought my shaver over a year ago and the blades were getting pretty dull.  The replacement head makes it seem like a new shaver  again.</li>
    <li> Yes, it fits my Norelco shaver.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t order this sooner, since now its shaving so much better. Arrived quickly as described.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> So I read all the bad reviews on the replacement head - bad shave, falls off razor, etc. If the red light had not kept flashing at me, I probably would have hobbled along for a couple more years on the original head. I kept the old head just in case, but now after several weeks I&#x27;m ready to throw it away and move on with my new, well shaved life. I&#x27;m a grey 62 year old who found the best shave of my life with my Arcitec Norelco. The replacement head is providing that once again.</li>
    <li> This replacement unit was such a relief for my face!! The old head was not getting the wiskers and this one does great...</li>
    <li> Being new I expected a better beard made​​, was not what happened. I do not know if it would be time to change, the exchange was not necessary here because the official home of the RQ10 crumpled to overturn it. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the RQ10 in my Arcitec for a few years now, replacing it every 6 months or so.  The shave is OK, but even new it never feels real smooth after shaving, and never gets longer hairs.  Based on a few reviews, I just tried the RQ12 instead.  Although Norelco won&#x27;t admit it, it DOES fit fine as an RQ10 replacement, and I&#x27;ve already found it does substantially better - very close and even gets long hairs.  The difference is amazing.  So skip this one and try the RQ12.</li>
    <li> trash! this is totally different as originals. but not very bad shaving though.trash! this is totally different as originals. but not very bad shaving though.</li>
    <li> These headsused to last about a year for me. I cleaned  them, as recommended by rinsing the share head with water. Once after replacing the head, I opened the old head to find it full of hair that never rinsed out. When faced with replacing the head of my shaver yet again, I just bought a whole new less expensive shaver. About $40 for a new shaver vs. about $70 for a new shaver head, double what I originally paid for replacement heads. Not only did the new shaver cost less, it did a better job of shaving in less than half the time. I will not be buying any more of these.</li>
    <li> This replacement head from Norelco keeps falling out of my razor.  When I use it and apply even modest pressure while shaving, this head just falls off.  I returned it to Amazon in exchange for another, but it has the same problem  I just does not fit the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for decades and like my Arcitec.  I still have some older heads and notice that they all have silver shanks.  The two new heads I just received have black shanks.  I&#x27;ve gone back to using an older, silver-shank head because it never, ever falls off the razor.  There is something defective with the series that has the black shank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking at the newest Arcitec line I see that (1) they are just too overpriced, (2) they only have 1-hour of shave time, (3) they still require carrying the fragile charging stand when traveling (absurd!),  and (4) some people are reporting that the head falls off of them, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ready to switch brands.  What is a good/better alternative to Norelco?  Brand and model, please.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this razor, and I like the way it makes his face baby smooth.  The original head lasted several years, but it was time for a new one, and Amazon had the best price.</li>
    <li> The new razor head came in the time advertised.  It was in excellent shape.  The installation was quick and easy, no problems.  Once installed, it worked well.  In fact, the razor shaves just like it did when it was brand new.  In sum, it came on time and worked as advertised.  All-in-all, an excellent transaction.</li>

    <li> I got my Husband and son on electric razor because regular razors are way too expensive. I replace the heads once a year as a christmas gift, or birthday.  They love them.  I always get the Norelco brand razors and replacement heads.</li>
    <li> This product is very good but very expensive. My Architect razor is still in great shape but I bought a different razor because the cost of replacement heads is prohibitive. I bought my new razor for what one RQ10 replacement head cost. I no longer use my Architect razor because of the replacement head cost. I could keep buying a new razor each time for what the RQ10 cost.</li>
    <li> The razor head hasn&#x27;t been opened due to the death of my husband. It will fit the razor but no one would use it. Would like to return it. It is the one he has used for a long time, but simply do not need it not.</li>
    <li> Hubby&#x27;s not happy but seems to be a design flaw in the razor. Will probably research for different brand next time.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t made as well as the original head on the razor.  The snap lock is now plastic and mine replacement head kept falling off up to several times per shave (very maddening).  Norelco would not do anything about it so I superglued it in and when it comes time to replace heads again, I will just buy a new razor I guess.  Once superglued, it has stayed in just fine though!</li>
    <li> Very good replacement shaver head. Readily available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The new shaver head(s) are one complete unit... My husband changes it yearly however I may start buying at Christmas and Father&#x27;s day.  Replacement is a &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; literally and the shaver works great.</li>
    <li> My old one lasted 7 years. What a difference</li>
    <li> The replacement head was delivered on time. It worked as expected.  It is a very easy replacement process. Just have to pop (pull) off the old head and click in the new one and done!</li>
    <li> Very easy replacement for the original head. Is a cheap fix instead of buying and expensive similar new complete shaver.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with both the price and the quality of this product. I recommmend anyone who needs a relacement to order it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Norelco products are quality goods.  At one point in time, this was top of the line quality.  With a new replacement head, it is as good as the first day it was used.</li>
    <li> The blades are just as they should be. I went a little long before replacing them this time, and it hurt (literally). The problem is no one carries these anymore and the prices are a little high. I fear that I will have to buy a new razor next time.</li>
    <li> Replacement head do not stay attach to shaver body. Factory Defect? wasted purchase. connection all plastic last one had a metal attachment.</li>
    <li> Correct item, the best price I found, and very easy to put on the shaver.  It is a good deal.</li>
    <li> I wasted so much gas driving all over town looking for this.  Now my husbands face is nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase my replacements from the drug store up the hill. Since I have Prime, thought I&#x27;d just buy this from Amazon and save the trip. Bad decision. This is clearly not a true Philips replacement blade. I have the old blade so I could compare. Right out of the gate, you can see the shaft is made of black plastic instead of metal. The heads only flex about two thirds of the span of the true Philips blade. This results is a poor shaving experience. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not worth my time to hassle with sending it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story? The drug store is only five minutes away, don&#x27;t be so lazy next time.</li>
    <li> So far so good. The product came quickly fits no problems. I think I need to change the head more frequently. The shave is good. I might have rated higher but it is still to new.</li>
    <li> I get a super smooth shave by starting with the RQ12 shaver head and swapping to the RQ10 shaver head for the last few minutes of shaving.  The RQ12 is quicker and gives a more even shave across all parts of my face, but the RQ10 cuts very short whiskers even shorter.  So when the RQ12 is not cutting any more whiskers, I swap to the RQ10 and it keeps on cutting.  The results are better than a shave with either the RQ10 or RQ12 on their own.  The downside is I have to clean 2 shaver heads each day, but the results are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Ordering, delivery, everything went smoothly.  Was very happy to see the results of the new shaver head, I don&#x27;t know why we waited so long to replace it.  It&#x27;s just too bad that we couldn&#x27;t just replace the blades instead of the whole head.</li>
    <li> Working well.  Do not have any problems or situations to tell. Good buy for what was required.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. I really like it. It&#x27;s price is reasonable. I recoment it for others. Thank you</li>
    <li> No complaints. Best quality! An original product !!!</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this and he uses it every day so I assume he likes it.  It is his favorite type of shaver</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present, but I do own one myself and it&#x27;s nice to have sharp new blades!</li>
    <li> nice item fast shipping</li>
    <li> ITEM RETURNED AS DID NOT WORK AS WELL AS THE OLD HEADS</li>
    <li> Does not shave as well as the original blade I got with the shaver.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time(3-4 days). It took only about 30 seconds to install the new one,and it works like a charm.Can&#x27;t ask for anything  more than that</li>
    <li> So after happily using the RQ12 on my 1050 - except for the fact that it wouldn&#x27;t fit easily in the travel case - it was time to renew, but the RQ12&#x27;s price went crazy high and stayed there, so I was forced to reluctantly go back to the RQ10. The hair chambers fill in the middle of my shave, so I have to stop, reach for my air blower, clear the chambers and start again, very tedious. I get the impression the RQ12 also shaved better. It&#x27;s enough to start looking for another brand that can reliably supply shaving heads with less drama, at less than extortionate prices.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for the second time after two years. That means that they are really good and last for about a year each set. I am glad Amazon carry them and delivery them very fast.</li>
    <li> the norelco worked very well, like it was suposed to, it is a pain to do this review, no more</li>
    <li> But... the unit is hard to hold. The head always pops off, when you adjust your grip. Overall nothing wrong with what I bought but there are better units.</li>
    <li> I order this every six months to replace my shaver head.  It is the same one that comes with the shaver out of the box.</li>
    <li> Exact fit. Easy to switch from the old head to this new one. Well worth the price. It shaves like a new razor.</li>
    <li> This was a life saver for my Norelco shaver, My blades were very dull and retail at the store was much more&lt;br /&gt;then what I paid on amazon, as most of you know the high end Philips razors do not have changeable blades ,&lt;br /&gt;so you must change the whole head, so basically though expensive it might seem after changing your razor is like new !!!</li>
    <li> DOES NOT MATCH UP TO PHILIPS QUALITY....HAD TO REPLACE WITHIN MONTH</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Works great</li>
    <li> Works like the original.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Fast delivery.  Cheaper than buying in the store.  The blades do not seem to last as long as the originals but these are original Norelco blades.</li>
    <li> Works great, however it pulls if I do not shave for a day or two.</li>
    <li> The RQ10 set received is not as sharp as tose previously used; almost as if different material used, ie,cold rolled steel or aluminum in lieu of Stainless Steel.  Seem&#x27;s that Norelco more interested in selling newer &amp; more expensive razor. I&#x27;ll probably look at another manufacturer&#x27;s list of productsnext tim in the market for an Electric Razor&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Bill Schoellkopf</li>
    <li> got it for hubby who needs to finally replace his old one which he used for 3+ years so hopefully this has the same usage span!</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. What more can you expect? They fit like they should and the blades go round when the motor is turned on. That is what they do.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Excellent Seller! Just as ordered and expected!</li>
    <li> Very good clean shave and doesn&#x27;t nick your face because the heads have such great flexibility. I Have some older model Norelco shavers and I bought the RQ10 heads and it fit on all of them. I use it a lot as I have a Yul Brynner cut.</li>
    <li> I think it is a great value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on auto ship and will continue.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have heavy growth, so this replacement head is working just fine for me. Less expensive than buying a new electric shaver!</li>
    <li> I find that the blades do not last as long as my older Norelcos&lt;br /&gt;Also even the new set leaves my face a little irritated&lt;br /&gt;Have to use soothing cream !&lt;br /&gt;If using the handle as formed, 1 blade always gets more action..&lt;br /&gt;No way to change position of blades.&lt;br /&gt;In short..*VERY DISSAPOINTED*</li>
    <li> Nothing special. The product was what I needed and it came when I needed it. There is no more to say.</li>
    <li> This replacement part was not as the original part .The weight of the item was much lighter then the original. The shave itself is not as close as my 4 year old blade was I only replaced my blades because I thought I would recieve a better and closer shave .I see these blades lasting may be 6 months before I would have to replace them again .I [[ASIN:B000UK16AI Philips Norelco RQ10/00 Replacement Head]]should have kept my old blades</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco Replacement Head RQ10/00 from Amazon.Com for my Norelco Arcitec 1050X shaver.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month so far and I must say that it works like the original shaver head. In addition, installing the replacement head was simple. While the original shaver head has what appears to be a metal base, the replacement head appears to be plastic.  However, the plastic base does not seem to affect the performance of the unit in any way.</li>
    <li> This item is a snap...literally, to replace. Awesome!Very pleased with purchase.Glad I found this on Amazon.Good.Norelco makes a good product!</li>
    <li> I replace these at least once per year. These work well and they arrived on time. I will place another order when it is time to replace these again.</li>
    <li> great price, rapid delivery, razor is again like new.</li>
    <li> These are the only replacement heads that will work on my Norelco shaver so I have to love them. They preform well but don&#x27;t last the six months as stated; however, I shave my head every time I shave which reduces the time they last. All in all I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with product very easy to replace came with directions would recommend to friends. A little pricy but worth it.</li>
    <li> best price on the best shaver head possible.</li>
    <li> This replacement head always works well for me.  It usually lasts for a year.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years which is proof itself that I liked their quality.  The useful life of a Norelco shaver was controlled by the degradation of the rechargeable batteries and the relative cost of replacing them v. the price of a new shaver. On the other hand the shaving head was immortal, possibly because of a self-sharpening design which made the last shave as good as the first.&lt;br /&gt;NOT so with the &amp;#34;very advanced&amp;#34; Arcitec 1050 model.  The shaving quality deteriorated rapidly to nearly zero and, soon, I was forced to buy a replacement head. The new head came with the recommendation that it be replaced every year, an expensive operation since the cost of the head was almost half the cost of a new shaver.  For the first month or two shaving results were excellent, but by the ninth month -- far less even then the promised one year -- the &amp;#34;very advanced&amp;#34; cutters did not cut. I do not have a particularly hard beard, nor did I shave every single day so the only explanation I can come up with is that the new shaving heads have been designed with some built-in planned obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;I am now using the third shaving head and the shaving quality is again very good ... but for how long?</li>
    <li> My razor was not getting the job done. New blades brought a close shave. Because the whole head changes out, it is like getting a new razor. Free shipping arrived within a couple/three days.</li>
    <li> For some reason I can not find this head in any of the local stores or military commissaries.  I love the razor and do not want to switch, so I have to buy a new head every year.</li>
    <li> I would rate it a five but after all it&#x27;s just a razor.  I just can&#x27;t bring myself to love it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised ,excellent service!</li>
    <li> Seems like a cheap knock-off.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco RQ10 replacement head makes my  electric shaver work like a brand new shaver!</li>
    <li> Fits right in and works like new.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and ordered.</li>
    <li> I took way too long to replace the blades this time.  The price is a bit steep.  But, once I replaced the head I became reacquainted  with what a great and comfortable shave my Norelco razor gives me.</li>
    <li> Husband absolutely loves these replacement heads.  They fit and sharpen, easy to install.</li>
    <li> The heads last about 4 months for me, but I have a heavy beard. I&#x27;ve HAD THE RAZOR FOR OVER 5 YEARS AND IT STILL WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Needed to replace old shaving head after about 8 years.  What a difference, think I&#x27;ll replace heads every year as recommended.</li>
    <li> I ordered this replacement head for my Son. He enjoys using it daily.  Normally these heads should be replaced every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I waited too long to replace the heads on my Norelco razor.  The old ones didn&#x27;t work well any more, and made a rattling noise, as if something was loose.  The new replacement heads make the razor like new again.</li>
    <li> After many different types of electric razors this is the one my husband likes best. He has very coarse hair and a lot of it.  He gets very good results and leaves no stubble, bumps or abrasions. The blade needs to be replaced annually, for us anyway. I would reccomend this product to any man with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for.  It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Extends useful life of shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this, because I thought it was the replacement head for my Senso 3D.  That was my mistake.  But, regardless, this is an extremely uncomfortable and overpriced head.  The blades are more inward facing, and they feel more like they are pulling hairs out vs. cutting them.  My 18 month old head is better than this.</li>
    <li> Looks like new again.</li>
    <li> Why I wait so long to replace these I don&#x27;t know, I suspect it is a personality defect. I want these blades to last forever but that is unreasonable. Works perfectly and now it doesn&#x27;t take me 10 minutes to shave</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered to update my husband&#x27;s shaver.</li>
    <li> It was a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> It came and we used it hours later. Thanks for the ability to shop and not leave home.  The best shopping ever..</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are for the only electric shaver I use, which I use daily.  They&#x27;re long lasting I only replace them twice per year or so.</li>
    <li> I bought the the shaver 2 years ago, and I had to replace it after 2 years, Phillips are well known for their good shavers that really last forever, very good quality</li>
    <li> Simply pop off and pop on, nice to get a clean shave again. Probably every two years is sufficient even though they say every year.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is better that previous ones. It seems to cut closer...... Finally! I use this razor as a spare one now because it hasn&#x27;t been real close shaving until I replaced with this latest head. Mynew panasonic es la 93k cuts even closer.</li>
    <li> WORKS THOSE WHISKERS DOWN REAL FAST...I USE IT ON MY CAT TOO KEEPS HER WHISKERS UNDER CONTROL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO ROCKS WITH MANSCAPING</li>
    <li> Replacement head works just fine, as I would expect it to.  No complaints about product or timeliness of filling order.</li>
    <li> Good job folks. The average costs of replacement heads is almost the price of a new shaver. Almost like printers and ink cartridges. So thanks again fof the great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> For some stupid reason, i went to empty my old one out over a toilet as it was flushing.  Yes, it seemed okay till I shook it and the head flew right out, into the bowl, nothing but drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a perfect replacement....till I dropped my razor again and it landed right on the head and broke it...welp, I went and ordered another one.</li>
    <li> The assembly was easy to replace &amp; I noticed the improvement in the shaving quality right away. I only changed it when the red indicator light started flashing &amp; it took seveeral shaves after the replacement for that indicator light to go out.</li>
    <li> I hope this head lasts longer than the previous one.  After only six months my husband had to replace the head on his electric razor.</li>
    <li> I didnt know that I will have a new shaver with this new head. I didnt think that my old head was so wear.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought this for my SensoTouch 3D shaver. I&#x27;m surprised it even fit, but it did. It then scraped and pulled its way across my face. It&#x27;s awful, painful, and does a poor job. When I realized my mistake I threw it out and got the RQ12 which is very good and similarly priced. Since both blades worked on the SensoTouch 3D, I&#x27;m guessing anyone who has a lesser model shaver (1000-series) that came with RQ10s can upgrade to RQ12s and I&#x27;d recommend they do so.</li>
    <li> quick service, decent price</li>
    <li> I wish I could write a good review for this, but I can&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t even last two months before it started to die. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s a great idea. It was shipped quickly. It worked well for a very short time. Too bad it only lasted two months, with fairly light use, before tanking.</li>
    <li> My razor is back to &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; status.  My skin is smooth, even in the &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; spots.  I definitely recommend replacing the head more frequently.</li>
    <li> My razor works like new again, perfect.  Great product and would highly recommend to everyone.  Received promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> I received my package in new condition and everything worked like it should. It&#x27;s good to be able to order and find this item when needed.</li>
    <li> Amazon you&#x27;re Great!! Ordering my husband&#x27;s Norelco Replacement Heads for his razor is so easy and less expensive. In a matter of a few days he is happy using his like new razor!</li>
    <li> First, I do get a good shave with the new replacement head. Much closer shave than the old original head. Time and many shaves does, and will take it&#x27;s toll on the blades. With that said, why do I rate it at 4 stars, instead of 5? Materials that make up the replacement head. It just doesn&#x27;t feel the same. New head in one hand and old head in the other, and you can tell the difference in quality. Yes it does cut better than the old head, but for how long? Old head, 2 years plus...new head, I&#x27;ll give it 13 months until replacement time. That&#x27;s my 4 cent&#x27;s worth of opinion.</li>
    <li> Norelco periodically changes models that require different replacement heads.  It then gets very expensive to replace old cutting blades.</li>
    <li> Even though I have been using Norelco for decades I am thinking of trying a Braun product. Either my wiskers have gotten harder or the blades to not seem to cut as close as the use to. You still get a decent shave.</li>
    <li> The Norelco RQ10 shaver head arrived on time in perfect condition.  The new shaver head is definitely was an improvement in shaving comfort and closeness over the 2+ year old shaving head I was using.</li>
    <li> The shaving heads cut at best ok, however many passes have to be made to get a real close shave.  The replacement unit falls off easily while shaving.  I would not recommend</li>
    <li> I use my Norelco a lot since I shave my face and my head every day. While I thought the old head was working fine, I now realize what a huge difference it makes to get a new head. When I first received the replacement, I was concerned because it felt lighter and not as sound as the original head. But, the quality is very good and the sharper blades make a big difference. I would give it 5-stars, but the new head does pop-off too easily when cleaning it. Not a big deal as long as it doesn&#x27;t get worse over time. For the price, it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Always gives a nice close shave in a razor that seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> great value and quick delivery</li>
    <li> This is a direct replacement for the head on my Arcitec shaver. Works just great. Seems expensive but does a good job and beats having to buy expensive blades. If you have this shaver and need to replace the blades, this works like the original.</li>
    <li> Great service and product.</li>
    <li> The RQ12 replacement heads are better than the RQ10, if you are able to find the RQ12.  There is a new RQ12+ replacement, but is has gotten terrible reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for many years. I like the shave this gives, and the battery life, but by one year it is too dull to use. I ended up using a blade for 2 months till I could find the replacement head.</li>
    <li> Replaced the head on my razor one snapped out the out in very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I had had the old ones for 1.5 years and they were not performing well, the new set did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Heads arrived quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for over 50 years. Several years ago&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; Norelco. The Arcitec.I made a very bad mistake. It is&lt;br /&gt;a poor excuse for a razor. I would not purchase it again. I would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;anyone buy it.</li>
    <li> When the wife tells me there&#x27;s still a few stray hairs on the cheek or chin, I change the head.  It will be several months before she signals me again!</li>
    <li> Great item at a great price. Flawless shave every morning. I highly recommend this item to anyone using the Architec shaver.</li>
    <li> this Philps Norelco shaver -- model SensoTouch 1160X -- is the very best shaver i have ever owned.  the replacement head RQ10 makes timely replacement easy ....  the entire assembly just \\&quot;pops\\&quot; on to the shaver base.  it is easy to clean and gives a fabulous shave.</li>
    <li> OK, printers need replacement ink that&#x27;s expensive, regular razors need constant replacement, etc, etc.  It&#x27;s always some consumable - get the device cheap, but pay up the yazoo for the main thing you need to do the job.  No exception with an electric razor.  Problem is, this one obviously is significantly inferior to the original, so you have to keep buying them over and over.  Or better yet, you get frustrated and buy a brand new razor, and then the cycle begins again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I&#x27;m off my soapbox now...</li>
    <li> Always dependable whenever I have ordered the RQ10. I have now moved on to a Wahl which is just amazing. This did the job from 2007/to 2014. Electric shaver technology has moved on by leaps since then.</li>
    <li> We buy this product about once a year and it keeps the razor going for another whole year. Eventually I suppose my husband will get another razor, but for now, we are just as happy replacing the head.</li>
    <li> I have used this for quite some time now.  I have a policy that when something works then you stick with it.  I have stuck with this particular razor model for 10 years.  no end is in sight.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the replacement head. Should have done it sooner. I was concerned over some of the other experiences people had, but have been very pleased and I have had the replacement head for some time now.</li>
    <li> This item snapped right on and began working perfectly as soon as I started it.  I appreciate the redesigned that makes this possible.</li>
    <li> these work great with my razor. a little on the expensive side but the work great and i would recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a harder to come by product which renews the life of your shaver without purchasing a new unit. I recommend replacement heads whenever possible.</li>
    <li> I have had my Norelco shaver for a number of years now and replaced the blades with this product just about every year or so.  This is the first time that the blades do not stay on the shaver when I am cleaning them.  It seems to me that the tolerences seem to have relaxed or that this replalcement set was just from a bad lot.  They work, just not to the excellence I have come to expect.</li>
    <li> What can i say  other than it does exactly what it should do - turns the shaver back into a \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; one as far as how well it shaves is concerned.  Should have bought two!</li>
    <li> Its nice to replace them about every two years. Once per year is not neccesassy, the blades are self sharpening.</li>
    <li> as advertised thank you</li>
    <li> The blades are easy to install and its a good product. However I wish the blades would stay sharpened longer&lt;br /&gt;then they do. You have to replace them every year if you want a close shave, and the cost is high. You could&lt;br /&gt;buy a cheaper Norelco electric shaver and throw it away once a year.</li>
    <li> Great way to give shave a second life.  Price is better than brick and mortar I have been able to find. Good for anyone who likes a close shave!</li>
    <li> Ordered this now twice, does the job, but think that the price is very high for a part, should be 25% less</li>
    <li> The neck that attaches to the shaver base is all plastic. The original was metal and fit better. It takes practice to keep the replacement from falling off while shaving. Not as sharp as the original, but still gives a decent shave.</li>
    <li> I wish they would make them so they last longer.  The profit is in the replacement blades.  I will look for another razor that users say the blades last longer</li>
    <li> Made a huge difference on the shaver.  Too bad it had to come from Korea.</li>
    <li> The Norelco  RQ10 shaving head and razor do a very good job of cutting short whiskers. They do not cut long whiskers very well, but work fine if you shave every day. To clean the head from clogged whiskers, leave the head attached and run the razor head fully submerged in hot soapy water  for about 30 to 40 seconds. Then open the head and rinse the soapy water off. Do this about once a month and the razor will last for a year or more. The razor head is clean if you can see through all the razor head openings when held up to the light..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gene</li>
    <li> What can you say about this?  It&#x27;s a replacement shave head.  Tool-free, just pull the old one off, push the new one on.  Cuts whiskers like the old one, only it&#x27;s new.</li>
    <li> I have been happily using these heads for nearly 4 years now.  I have them setup on auto-order from Amazon for every 6 months, and thats about the average life span.  They hold up well to  travel, and give me a smooth shave every time, without cutting up my face.</li>
    <li> While the RQ10 gives a good shave, the blades wear out too quickly and the replacement head is too expensive.</li>
    <li> it matchs my rq1095,it works well.when i use it , i have a nice shave experience.i like it very much</li>
    <li> after almost 4 years we finally needed to change the blades on the razor.  works as good as new now</li>
    <li> excellent, works as advertised... this is my 2nd replacement head since original, awesome product and I am a tough shaver, best shave out of all previous electric razors, love the fact you can flip open and clean/wash the heads after every use</li>
    <li> After a while, the head loose cutting efficiency, it takes more time to shave and the battery drain more and more rapidly. I look for a replacement part and found this genuine one for a very good price too.</li>
    <li> The replacement has worked well although I wish the razor worked better.  Obviously, Phillips Norelco saw this model lacking in some respects being that this model wasn&#x27;t sold for very long.  My wife picked it up for a Christmas present to me. I believe when it came out it was one of the premium models.  I do wish it did a better job of getting all the beard.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this model but like I said they have discontinued this model.  I hope the newer models do a better job of shaving.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco replacement head works as well as the original head, although there&#x27;s more plastic in the replacement than in the original.  This aside, the head still delivers a very comfortable and close shave for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> If a replacement head is needed, this is the one to buy. It is as good as the original. One should replace razor heads periodically and this makes it easy.</li>
    <li> Recieved my replacement head sooner then the promised date. I installed it right away. It fit and worked as good as brand new. I used it and had a perfct shave. Will buy from Amazon.com will buy from them when I need a new one.</li>
    <li> Original &#x27; part from Norelco has replaced metal with rubber part.  This causes part to slip loose and come loose.  Call to company&lt;br /&gt;That sold it, says \\&quot;call norelco\\&quot;.  Norelco says since it&#x27;s part of the blade cutting system, and has no warranty.  BUT  if I want to&lt;br /&gt;Try another they  will give me a &#x27;discount&#x27;.  Good service -  No No it&#x27;s not.  Going with another shaver.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several times before.  The shaver replacement head fit exactly and I enjoy the auto ship for convenience.</li>
    <li> I ordered these replacement heads, which arrived on time. I installed them very easily and now they work perfectly fine. Price was more reasonable than local retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. I am very satisfied with the product !</li>
    <li> ORIGINAL HAD A METAL BASE THAT&#x27;S THE PART THAT ATTACHED TO THE RAZOR BASE THE REPLACEMENT WAS PLASTIC IT&#x27;S COME OFF TWICE NOW</li>
    <li> When the new Head arriveed I opened the box and found the Head incased in a protective cover. I carefully opened the cover, removed the new Head and took the old Head off the razor. I attempted to put the old Head back into the protective cover and place it in the box for disposal. It turns out the new Head is a smaller than the old Head, it wouldn&#x27;t fit into the protective cover. It does work however, but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that the change wasn&#x27;t disclosed when I made the purchase. Next time I will contact Norelco to see if they made a change in the Head size or if Amazon is selling a knock-off.</li>
    <li> It works, what I can say.  Not like the original but gets job done.  Its just OK for the money.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be super sharp or anything or save time on saving.  Still have to go over spots a few times.</li>
    <li> wish it would shave a little closer but not bad&lt;br /&gt;need to see how long it keeps shaving good</li>
    <li> My old shaver seems to eat these uo every 3- 6 months but closer to 3 than 6. This vendor delivers on time with no problems.</li>
    <li> My housban is very happy with his Norelco Shaver and also with the excelent  replacement. He has been using these item for years with very good result .</li>
    <li> We live overseas, so when my husband needed a new replacement head for his shaver, this was the best way to go.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like the original one it came with.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Unfortunately, it appears that Norelco no longer manufacturers this item, so the price is triple what it was when the item was in production. That said, it&#x27;s still cheaper than getting a new shaver. Add a star to the review if money is no object.</li>
    <li> The replacement head works just as well as the original one. It is identical in every way. Shopping for it was interesting since the units advertised were all the same, but the prices varied widely - careful shopping on-line was required to find a decent price!</li>
    <li> I get these every year and it provides me with a clean smooth shave as if the razor was new.</li>
    <li> This works fine and has my razor acting similar to new again. If it was cheaper I would rate a 5!</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product thru Amazon for several years and have received a good product and quick delivery each time.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these before and they are easy to use and work well. Would recommend them to anyone with this razor</li>
    <li> this is a great product and does a good job in removing five o&#x27;clock shadow. I will buy more as needed.  I am on the list to receive one every six months.</li>
    <li> Ok replacement . Just in general the replacement head or head in general cannot store much cut beard.&lt;br /&gt;The razor heads are very shallow and if you have a heavy beard you need to empty one than once per shave.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise it is a good replacement.</li>
    <li> Buy this every 12-18 months.  Always works as expected.  Norelco quality at a good price.  Highly recommend for all Norelco users.</li>
    <li> The replacement head worked, and packaging and delivery were fine.  Unfortunately, the new head feels about the same as the old head after about three days of use.</li>
    <li> Replacement head is as advertised. So far living up to the Phillips Norelco reputation of a well made product. A little pricey though!</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT IS GREAT  I WILL ORDER SOME MORE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE, VERY SATISFIED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE BLADES.  THANK&#x27;S,</li>
    <li> Easy purchase, rapid shipment and super easy replacement. Razor works as good as new.  Love the new head and blades.</li>
    <li> yes, arrive automatically with no problem every time. very satisfyed</li>
    <li> i bought one about a year ago and i am very pleased with it.they are just great.i would tell anybody to buy them.</li>
    <li> found it very easy to order the replacement head instead of looking through the local stores,which rarely have the correct number to fit my razor.  The replacement head is great.</li>
    <li> excellent product, husband loves this shaver!</li>
    <li> These were different than the original heads that came with the Arcitec 1050 unit.   These are bulky and do not allow you to shave close to your nose or ears since the heads are further away from the edges.   After two months one of the heads would not keep closed. Ended up throwing the unit away.</li>
    <li> This has made all the difference in my morning shave.  Like having a new razor.  Should have gotten it 2 months ago!</li>
    <li> Great price, great stuff, great speed.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to have RQ10 with such a low price. Recommend to you all!</li>
    <li> the original head that came with my shaver had a metal base which kept the head in place. It also lasted about a year and a half before i had to change it. This replacement feels cheep and falls from the shaver at times. I use this for my face and head and with the original i did not have a problem, this replacement causes me irritation and after 4 months of use i need to replace it again since it is pulling instead of cutting. what a terrible product. I recently bought a panasonic shaver which was part of the deal of the day so i had to pay 20 dollars more from what the replacement head for the norelco cost and I love the shaver. No more irritation and does the job quicker.</li>
    <li> This item met my expecations and does a good job in removing my whiskers.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Hubby needed to replace the head on his shaver. I went to Amazon.com, found this product, bought it and it arrived in just a couple of days. He popped off the old one and popped on the new. His shaver is just like new in perfect condition. Fast, easy and so simple.</li>
    <li> Very good for the first 6 months the one of the heads became a little rough and had to replaced again. This time for a Norelco model 510</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband and he is very pleased.  It gives a close shave and is easier to clean than the old one.</li>
    <li> Needed to replace worn head, of course no subtitute is available in stores or on line. It was this or new razor.</li>
    <li> This seems way overpriced, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new shaver and i&#x27;m going on 3 years with the same blades. After replacing them it takes quite a bit less time to shave. It works like new again. I just wish they were much cheaper as it would be nice to replace these every year as they recommend. I just don&#x27;t think the shaver is good enough to justify ~$50 per year in maintenance.</li>
    <li> This product only includes the blades; it is not a replacement for the full head.  I think the product placement is misleading.</li>
    <li> These RQ10 was hard to find. Locally, RQ8 &amp; RQ11 at decent price at..several stores. I found it on line from the manufacturer but, my&lt;br /&gt;I also checked out Amazon and found the same thing at a better price. Im getting a really good shave now.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000UK16AI Philips Norelco Replacement Head RQ10/00]] I have used a Norelco shaver for a good many years and through a lot of different models.The one I have now, the arcitec has been my shaver for a number of years because I have invested in a new head every year or so.The replacement head is a lot less than buying a new razor of course, and it keeps your arcitect working like it did when it was brand new. It only took a few days for it to arrive and of course, I was able to use the free shipping option so my experience was super all around.</li>
    <li> Replacement Head does not worth the money paid for. It doesnt give a close shave as a blade with manual shaver.</li>
    <li> got it promptly without any hitch. great way to buy things Thanks Norelco&lt;br /&gt;i trust the company great job. three cheers</li>
    <li> What can I say? It was made for my razor and gives me a good shave. Oh, yes, gotta type 4 more words</li>
    <li> Expensive.  Once you buy the razor, you are stuck buying replacement heads from Phillips at whatever price they charge.</li>
    <li> service was satisfactory and the shaver head was the correct one</li>
    <li> Great! real close shave.</li>
    <li> New blades just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great item. Perfect fit for my razor</li>
    <li> Quality product and much needed replacement for existing head I was using.  Very happy with product and service.</li>
    <li> Ordered before. Great deal.</li>
    <li> The old ones wore out and glad I found it here, saves me running all over town to find them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doing the work nicely. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The new head is performing the way it should.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. I shaves faster than the 3 year head I was using. I am satisfied, although, the price is getting to high.</li>
    <li> The replacement head arrived as promised and works great.</li>
    <li> Good original product.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads quickly snapped into place and were immediately working perfectly ....</li>
    <li> My husband has had his shaver for several years.  He has replaced the blades before, through Amazon, several times; but this time, the shaver doesnt seem to be shaving as closely.  He is wondering if something is wrong with the shaver itself which he purchased from a place that quaranteed it for life so maybe he needs to send it back for an overhaul???</li>
    <li> QUITE EXPENSIVE BUT PERFORMS WELL.</li>
    <li> This replacement head has worked flawlessly and is a great value compared to purchasing from other sources. I would suggest this to all who need it.</li>
    <li> I had been using my Philips Arcitec for about two years when I happened to read some comments about the maintenance of your razor.  My Arcitec performed to my full satisfaction and I thought that the writer must be working for Philips trying to boost the sale of replacement parts.  Just to be on the safe side I ordered the Philips Norelco RQ10 Replacement Head, which was very promptly delivered to my mailbox.  For no reason at all I decided to test the new shaving head and almost fell off my chair.  The difference in shaving time and after shave feeling is istriking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lars Dalman</li>
    <li> I love using this razor..  I keeps my face smooth and hair free.  Charges up quickely and has it&#x27;d own case.</li>
    <li> It is less expensive to buy and have it shipped to Brazil than to buy it here.  And it is faster.</li>
    <li> the replacement head made the shave like the razor was brand new.  It was easy to remove the old head and replace it with the new one.</li>
    <li> I have to use the shaver twice in a day if also doing something in the evening, shaver is adequate as a time saver.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t replace my razor head nearly enough!  This is my second replacement, and has given my razor a new lease on life.</li>
    <li> that i had to go online was dissapointing however it was what was needed and is working great the gentleman for whome it was bought is pleased</li>
    <li> I always purchased my replacement heads from Target but they were out for months and I could tell my shaver was laboring with the old heads. Went online, found it on Amazon, ordered it and poof, in no time at all, my shaver is happy and so is my face.</li>
    <li> Works great and you only need to buy a new one every 12 months.  Somewhere on one of the sites it said you had to buy one every 4 months.</li>
    <li> They are not the same as the set that came with my Razor . My original set was much better.</li>
    <li> Replacing the head on the razor is like getting a new razor.  Replacing the head was a just a pull-off, push on process.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this item before.  With this razor you have to replace it at least once a year or it quits cutting.  As far as the item itself, I am satisfied.  It sure improved the shave.</li>
    <li> Have to replace the entire head (more costly) and cannot get into th blades to clean them. Even though you can rinse under water, it does not get it entirely clean.</li>
    <li> When I bought the shaver they said to change heads yearly. Then, they changed the recommendation to 6 months and now it is every 3 months. In reality I get a great shave for about 2 weeks then it goes down hill fast. I suspect they are now using cheep Chinese steel.&lt;br /&gt;I can buy and older model shaver packaged with a replacement head for a few $ more than a single RQ10.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> This product worked with my razor, but was not the same as the original.  The original had thicker heads and shaved better than this one.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, and it installed as indicated. The pricing was the best I could find and  Amazon is a trusted provider that has resolved problems when they have (rarely) occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on this product: I follow  the directions and clean it as scheduled using alcohol as suggested. I have noted that cleaning really matters in terms of the effectiveness of the blades and I suspect the life as well.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my friend, he liked it very much and said that Philips Norelco RQ10 Replacement Head is great quality exactly what he expected :&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Philips recommends changing the heads once a year. I am afraid they suppose daily use (365days/year). I got my arcitect 3 years ago and it is still OK to use, but I don´t shave daily. Anyways, I got this just in case.</li>
    <li> Because I like the product and it does what is is suppose to do.  I don&#x27;t think I would use any other product.</li>
    <li> New brand name product in factory sealed packaging at a good price. Easy and fast and I never had to leave my office!</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to throw my machine away&lt;br /&gt;Great for at least one more year that is why I got three</li>
    <li> I put these on once a year and its like having a new razor again. Very easy to install and remove. And a lot cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> Replacement blades work as well as the design allows for; I have had closer shaves with other Norelco products as opposed to the arcitec.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and preforms as expected</li>
    <li> Excellent product--I&#x27;ve used this razor for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Fits &amp; functions as it should.</li>
    <li> Same head as original razor - fit like a charm!  Prompt delivery - only issue was payment, since my card number had changed during the interim.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement heads for Norelco saver -- bought these about a year ago, and I&#x27;m still getting great, smooth shaves.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible item. Shaves as good as one that&#x27;s a year old. I&#x27;m throwing it out and buying something else</li>
    <li> SIMPLY WAS A BETTER HEAD AND EASIER TO CLEAN WHEN PLACING UNDER THE WATER.  THE OLD HEAD THAT CAME WITH THE SHAVRE WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THIS REPLACEMNT.  GREAT SERVICE AND SPEED OF DELIVERY ALSO.</li>
    <li> Does not shave closely enough. I replaced my old one of about 3 years, and the new one is no improvement</li>
    <li> these new blades were easy to change out, my neck does not turn red after shaving. very pleased, much cheaper than buy a new razor.  Rod</li>
    <li> Since the Norelco RQ 10 Replacement head has been discontinued, the price for the ones left are outrageous and highway robbery. Two months ago, the price was half of what it is now. I guess its \\&quot;supply and demand\\&quot;. Norelco rips people off because they are constantly changing Razors so heads cannot be replaced. Too bad because its an excellent Razor.</li>
    <li> Fits razor perfectly.  Works just as good as the original I purchased w/the razor.  I have no complaints on this product.</li>
    <li> Found it on the web ordered it and it fit and worked perfectly on the shaver I have used for two years now.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Should be more reliable/durable.  Replacement is too expensive to be so short.  I can buy a lot of throwaway blade razors for the same price.</li>
    <li> The new head works great and the shipment arrived very quick, this is the only way I will get my replacement heads in the future. No more making three trip to find the part in stock and paying more for it in the store. Thanks</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if replacing my shaving head would be worth the money but it does do a better job and saves me time at tis tedious chore. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Cost me out of pocket to send it back &amp; a $7 &amp;#34;re-stocking fee&amp;#34; whatever the HELL that is.  This comment is NOT against Norelco at all.  I love my razor.</li>
    <li> good price, work well</li>
    <li> Nice, usual and do a good shave.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> The RQ10 head was fine.  However, I only paid $150 for the Arcitec razor and had to pay $120 for a replacement head.  But that&#x27;s better than buying the head from Norelco for $145.</li>
    <li> My husband has said that it meets all that he expected.  Great!</li>
    <li> This is the third replacement head I have bought for  this razor. None have been nearly as good as the original.  They all work reasonably well for a few weeks then its rapid downhill performance.  But it is all you get.</li>
    <li> I have been meaning to purchase new heads for my shaver for over a year.  Very happy that I did.  The razor now performs like new again.  Should be able to get another 2+ years and 800+ shaves out of these.</li>
    <li> PRICED RIGHT, FIT RIGHT, LOOKS LIKE THE FACTORY EXCEPT THAT THE BODY IS MADE OF HEAVY PLASTIC AND NOT METAL BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN A PROBLEM AND I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER A MONTH NOW.</li>
    <li> Price ok, performance ok.</li>
    <li> Works great with my husband&#x27;s Norelco....his blades on the old one were getting very dull so this worked great and cost less than a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Performed as promised</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference in sharpness of these and the originals that I had used for years.</li>
    <li> Came as expected. Work great! I gave it 4 stars because of the &amp;#34;high price&amp;#34; of these heads!! You have to have them, so you are kinda stuck for the price!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement head for razor; fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> best shaver ever---get on the list to have them sent to you regularly</li>
    <li> The RQ10 Replacement Heads fit and worked just like original equipment.</li>
    <li> Amazon was the &#x27;only&#x27; place I could find this RQ10 replacement head for my razor.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I replaced the shaver heads because my very old ones were causing razor burn.  The new ones are better but after only a few months I am again getting mild irritation.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He&#x27;s only used it one time, but is happy and says it worked just fine. The razor&#x27;s old replacement head wore out after several years of use. If this new one lasts as long, he will be more than pleased with this gift. We would buy this again.</li>
    <li> If you have a Norelco shaver, these make it just like new. No change in the performance from the original.</li>
    <li> These heads seemed a bit different than the normal ones i used to buy. It shaves less and irritates more. Meh.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as the original--but works OK</li>
    <li> I found Phlips Norelco RQ10/00 replacement heads to be equal to the quality and performance of the OE head they replaced.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> not shaving as cleanly as the original head.&lt;br /&gt;also the individual shaving heads do not flex as easily as the original ones</li>
    <li> good product,a bit high on the price.  Fit the razor with no problems,  razor like new, clean shave.  I would say it is worth buying.</li>
    <li> After more than a decade of my faithfully using this razor, and no plans for using any other, I think I have a good handle on its attributes, so I&#x27;ll just begin here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s a very good shaver. It rarely pulls at the skin, or burns, or nicks. Yes, there might be those with one feature or other that can top it, but for a good all-around shaver -- which is really all that should count at the heart of it -- I&#x27;m very satisfied with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING QUALITY: It&#x60;s very good...I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m embarrassed or proud when I admit this, but I&#x27;ve only changed the heads twice in my 11+ years, and that&#x27;s a ridiculously low amount (they recommend yearly .) Part of it was frugality, but the major part of it has been the fact that I&#x27;m pleased with the razor as it is. I simply don&#x27;t think it needs it. As I keep up a pretty good regimen of cleaning it almost every single time I shave, then I don&#x27;t have any problems shaving. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Incidentally, I have never had any success shaving with a wet beard...I always make sure that my face is dry. While it may be able to be cleaned under the faucet, I have found that the act of shaving with a wet beard causes clumping of the hairs in the razor heads.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING COMFORT: It&#x27;s good overall. I admit that it&#x27;s not as smooth as, say, the best shave a quality hand razor can give when it&#x27;s brand new. But it&#x27;s always good, and when kept clean it shaves comfortably, close, and leaves my face feeling smooth, and fine...no burning sensations from over-shaving, nor ever having had the feeling that I have nicked myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: As shaver manufacturers will tell you, don&#x27;t switch to an electric shaver and expect a perfect shave right out of the box. I&#x27;ll confirm what they tell you: you have to wait for several shaves with an electric for it to \\&quot;find\\&quot; that comfort zone. It&#x27;s as much your skin as it is the electronic razor: they just need time to get acquainted before you can say whether you like the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Arcitec, you can see that the razors within the heads move in a circular motion within their housings. Each of the three razor heads move independently of the other, which I find really helpful when I&#x27;m switching from, say, my chin to my cheek. You don&#x27;t want an unbending razor there, as you&#x27;ll either miss whole areas or \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your skin. It&#x27;s a nice system, and primarily why the shaves are so comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: Here&#x27;s where this can&#x27;t be beaten by straight razors. You have a one-time cost of purchasing it. After that, it&#x27;s almost cost free. And when you consider what it costs to buy a quality hand razor, and add to that the cost of replacing those blades on a regular basis for the life of that razor, and you know what I mean.  There&#x27;s almost no way to use a brand-name hand razor cheaply...those blades are ridiculously expensive. (And I am not swayed by the thought that two-, three-, four-, or even five-bladed razors are better than a single good razor.) And then there&#x27;s shaving cream, and so on. This shaver is a one-time expense. That&#x27;s it. (And need I mention the environmental waste of those plastic disposable razors?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAINTENANCE: What could be simpler? Even if I admit that I&#x27;m probably woefully behind in my blade replacement, this is a product that has lasted quite well with little maintenance. And I&#x27;m still happy with my shave.  Still, were I to replace the blades right now, the new heads on Amazon would cost me less than $50 which, I&#x27;ll admit, isn&#x27;t cheap, but I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s less than a six-month supply of fancy hand razor replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY INDICATOR: I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an electric razor out there that doesn&#x27;t  inform its user of a low battery, but this one simply does it in an extremely wise manner: it informs you of the minutes remaining EVERY TIME YOU PICK IT UP and use it. From its maximum charge in the 75-minute range until the single digits, you&#x27;re aware of howmuch it has left. There&#x27;s no having to guess whether you&#x27;re getting low when you&#x27;re heading away for the weekend: the remaining time is clearly displayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE TRIMMER: It&#x27;s a great tool, and yes, you can get your hair caught in the other part while you&#x27;re concentrating about your sideburns or elsewhere. The best prevention is to just detach the heads...the trimmer is an independent part, and it&#x27;s just a two-second job each way of taking off the shaver heads and then replacing them when you&#x27;re done. (The trimmer works really nicely, by the way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the Philips Norelco Arcitec and can say truly, after over a decade, it&#x27;s not going anywhere.when you&#x27;re heading away for the weekend: the remaining time is clearly displayed.

    <li> This was exactly what I needed. It was easy to get the new head on and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived very promptly and was in great shape.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to any customers who have this Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Easy way to replace head on razor no shopping around to find part.</li>
    <li> These heads are the best and bring a new joy the the shaving experience...the new head cut my shaving time in half...and was close again...make the razor seem as good or better than new...</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the purchase of my Norelco replacement head.  It made my razor work as if it was new.</li>
    <li> Fits well, works beautifully;  A great tune-up for my favorite razor, at about 20% of the cost of getting a new razor.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest cutting heads.  I have used other brand shavers and obtained a closer shave</li>
    <li> I was nervous after reading some poor reviews, but after using this replacement for a few months. It seems to be working like the original one.  Easy to install too.</li>
    <li> Great replacement! I works perfectly and it&#x27;s very simple to change between replacement heads. It is a MUST every year.</li>
    <li> Not much to say for an exact OEM product. They work, the service was great and my face is once again clean shaven.</li>
    <li> Worked and easy to order.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about purchasing replacements because several people reported problems with them.  I have not had those problems with mine.</li>
    <li> .....didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old head had gotten.  My husband is very pleased with this replacement head.  He dropped his shaver and bent the old one, otherwise, he&#x27;d probably never have asked for a new one.  Price is much better than replacing the whole shaver!</li>
    <li> IF YOU LIKE A CLOSE SHAVE .....NORELCO IS FOR YOU.  I JUST WISH THE HEADS WOULD STAY SHARP ..IT LASTS ABOUT 1/2 YEAR.. NEVER  FOR A FULL YEAR. THEY  DON&#x27;T MAKE THEM TO STAY SHARP FOR LONG, THAT IS HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY NOW A DAYS...</li>
    <li> not as good as original</li>
    <li> These heads were a definite improvement over the ones that I had which were probably well worn out. I have subsequently gotten a Braun as a gift and like it much better than the Norelco though.</li>
