      <li>10x better 1/4 the price.</li>
      <li>But it works for me :)</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and wasn&#x27;t able to find until i went on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Most don&#x27;t realize that it is a vegan product, which is as added bonus.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner has all good things going for it - sulfate &amp; paraben free as well as being vegan &amp; gluten free, then we find silicone.</li>
      <li>Excellent product doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.</li>
      <li>Glad it&#x27;s gluten free</li>
      <li>Yay this item is gluten free, sulfate free and paraben free!</li>
      <li>I can easily comb through my hair.</li>
      <li>I am so happy with this conditioner I will buy more when I finish the current bottle.</li>
      <li>but it is so strongly perfumed that you stink of it for days.</li>
      <li>had my hair cut right after starting this product and it is in excellent condition.</li>
      <li>husband, who has fine hair, doesn&#x27;t care for it, and complains about a residue.</li>
      <li>I read this product is gluten free.  </li>
      <li>I needed something gluten free and preferred no sulfates as well as I have a gluten allergy and my hair is colored.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fairly cheap in Costco</li>
      <li>I am allergic to wheat, so had to find hair products that were gluten free.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product for needing a gluten, corn, dairy free product.</li>
      <li>I use it every time I shower, and it leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>sulfate free; goes well with keratin.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a fantastic deal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used twice, so far so good.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser knows i&#x27;m on a budget and told me this line of haircare from Kirkland Signature was just as good if not better than Nexxus and at a better cost for those of us who don&#x27;t fall prey to the fact that if you pay more you get a better quality product.</li>
      <li>Usually get at Costco, happy to see on here!  </li>
      <li>Though the shampoo/conditioner are still really good- not quite at the same level of pureology.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>so my hair doesnt dry out, but it was amazing!</li>
      <li>I was buying a non-sulfate free shampoo/conditioner from another club store and it cost about $4 more a bottle and did not work nearly as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s supper thick, has very high end ingredients, inexpensive and, most importantly, leaves my hair looking AMAZING!</li>
      <li>but it was calm and looked like i crimped it</li>
      <li>I also cocktail the conditioner with biolage&#x27;s blue agave gel, and find that it makes for great, soft, non-frizzing</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price and comparable to a high-end product like Pureology.</li>
      <li>This is true, however Costco memberships are far from free and if (like me)</li>
      <li>I like this conditioner very much.</li>
      <li>This gluten free conditioner leaves my hair soft and not oily.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and will definitely be keeping it around!</li>
      <li>but it smells a bit funny to me.</li>
      <li>I actually find it more moisturizing than my Pureology products.  </li>
      <li>I swear it is exactly the same product as Bumble &amp; Bumble Super Rich Conditioner.</li>
      <li>(Apparently I&#x27;m not supposed to do that :))</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell clean and good, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;weighted&amp;#34; down or oily.</li>
      <li>Did not react and I am super sensitive to products.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells STRONG and the scent lasts for several days.</li>
      <li>And it certainly does not get rid of tangles</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will certainly buy this conditioner again.</li>
      <li>THICK hair and makes smooth and easy to manage!</li>
      <li>( My hair is very kinky.)</li>
      <li>I let it sit in my hair about 5 minutes in the shower and my hair feels very moisturized.</li>
      <li>Someone was not thinking straight while deciding formulation ratios in this one.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need extra since it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
      <li>feel that this conditioner is lightweight yet has the ability to really silken your hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  Most don&#x27;t realize that it is a vegan product, which is as added bonus.  The smell is very pleasant (and I am extremely sensitive to smells).  If you have a local Costco, You can buy this there for $7&#x27;ish.</li>
    <li> I am 23 years old, and YES this smells LIKE FOR OLD PEOPLE. It is very sweet, floral with a twinge of musk, and the smell is VERY VERY STRONG. I dont recommend it for a younger crowd.</li>
    <li> This stuff is satan&#x27;s conditioner. It is pure concentrated EVIL!  It joins it&#x27;s cousin \\&quot;Kirkland Signature Shampoo\\&quot; in the unholy circle of awful hair-care products (check out my review there as well if you&#x27;re interested). Here&#x27;s some solid reasons why you should stay the hell away from this product:  - GREASY BUILDUP: This stuff will leave you with the greasiest nastiest hair ever without fail, every time you use it. Regardless of how much you try to rinse off, you will find yourself feeling like you need another shower 2 hours after you use this stuff.  - BAD FRAGRANCE: If you like smelling like old-lady perfume/farts then this stuff is for you! Otherwise, keep your hair from being a stinky mess and avoid this product like the plague.  - DOES NOT ACTUALLY CONDITION YOUR HAIR: Amazingly, this product manages to leave you with greasy nasty hair and yet does not make your hair any more moisturized or healthy. And it certainly does not get rid of tangles (for those of you who&#x27;s hair dries out in the winter like mine does, this will not address that need at all).  As I mentioned in my review of the Shampoo, I&#x27;m a long-time fan of Kirkland Signature/Costco products and I&#x27;m used to getting great quality from their stuff. This product is not one of those quality-ensured things. Also, don&#x27;t think I didn&#x27;t give it a chance...I used this stuff and the shampoo for 3 solid awful weeks before I finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. Save yourself the money and the headache and buy a bottle of Aussie instead. It&#x27;ll do the job 10x better 1/4 the price.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has all good things going for it - sulfate &amp; paraben free as well as being vegan &amp; gluten free, then we find silicone. Eventually, we will get it all in one product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, definitely worth the price and then some. Left my hair which is coarse very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Bought it in hopes that it would be similar to pureology. Though the shampoo/conditioner are still really good- not quite at the same level of pureology.</li>
    <li> sulfate free; goes well with keratin. all i use; highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wish I had waited for my next trip to Costco to get this.  I figured there would be a markup, but no idea they almost doubled the price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is awesome.  Leaves hair silky smooth.  You don&#x27;t need extra since it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Love this. I buy once a month.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner.  Not only does it smell clean and good, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;weighted&amp;#34; down or oily.</li>
    <li> With curly dry hair I prefer using sulfate free products. They do have an adjustment period though where hair catches up from being stripped of all oils from the sulfates. I love how it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls yet moisturizes. I recently had 2 inches cut off my hair and even after that I was still using detangler just to get out the knots. I used this conditioner and didn&#x27;t even need to comb it out. I let it sit in my hair about 5 minutes in the shower and my hair feels very moisturized. I was buying a non-sulfate free shampoo/conditioner from another club store and it cost about $4 more a bottle and did not work nearly as well. Plus I love the pump bottle for ease of dispensing. The smell of this conditioner is a bit like vanilla shea lotion and it&#x27;s texture is about as thick as a body cream which means a little goes a long way. Very pleased, especially since the nearest Costco is about 2 hours away and having this delivered to my door for free with prime is a great deal!</li>
    <li> I needed something gluten free and preferred no sulfates as well as I have a gluten allergy and my hair is colored. This stuff is fairly cheap in Costco and I picked it up and do not regret it. Awesome! Leaves hair super soft and definitely NOT weighed down. Smells really nice too. And you barely need any to do the job.  My hair is 1/2 down my  back and is usually thin with frizz and a mix of curls and waves. This stuff really cuts out my frizz and I love it also has a UV protectant and is vegan as well. Highly recommend especially  for the price.</li>
    <li> I am a curly hair guru and this is my staple product! I use this as my conditioner and leave-in. It works great in african-american hair (my hair is around a 3c texture). It is well worth the price and comparable to a high-end product like Pureology. It lasts me months!</li>
    <li> This product produced terrible results. Hair does not behave as expected after using it. I could not believe the feel of this product. Overall one of the worst products I have used.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a good price.  Highly moisturizing conditioner for my dry, curly hair.  Feels very soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very soft and conditioned. Great product. So happy to have found this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when at Costco based on the reviews here. The price is great and seems to do a good job with my hair however the smell is so strong and perfumey I just can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells however this shampoo/conditioner smells stronger than any other I have used.  Had it not been for the string smell it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> my favorite! Usually get at Costco, happy to see on here!  THICK hair and makes smooth and easy to manage!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have thick, long curly hair that tends to dry out and tangle. This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found so far! I co-wash 5-6 days a week, and the kirkland counterpart shampoo about once a week as well. It leaves my hair soft, moisturized and I&#x27;ve seen a lot less breakage since I began using it about a year ago. I also cocktail the conditioner with biolage&#x27;s blue agave gel, and find that it makes for great, soft, non-frizzing curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, who has fine hair, doesn&#x27;t care for it, and complains about a residue. But it works for me :)</li>
    <li> Perfect conditioner!! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair too oily and it smells amazing! I&#x27;m glad I found this shampoo/conditioner set!</li>
    <li> After extensive resesarch, I decided to purchase this item. This gluten free conditioner leaves my hair soft and not oily. Believe the hype.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and wasn&#x27;t able to find until i went on Amazon. Excellent product doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out. The conditioner works well too.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to wheat, so had to find hair products that were gluten free.  This works real well and my hair feels very silky.</li>
    <li> Yay this item is gluten free, sulfate free and paraben free! I am so happy with this conditioner I will buy more when I finish the current bottle.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY long, thick, coarse hair, and it always seemed like I was looking for that one conditioner that I could stick with. This stuff is awesome! You don&#x27;t have to keep slathering it on like others, I always felt I had to use multiple conditioners to get the moisture to soak into my hair, with this stuff it&#x27;s a one stop deal. I wash my hair everyday too (Apparently I&#x27;m not supposed to do that :)) But the problem was that my scalp gets oily if I don&#x27;t. This stuff moisturizes enough that I can still wash daily without my ends drying out. Not to mention it smells amazing! Great buy :)</li>
    <li> My hairdresser knows i&#x27;m on a budget and told me this line of haircare from Kirkland Signature was just as good if not better than Nexxus and at a better cost for those of us who don&#x27;t fall prey to the fact that if you pay more you get a better quality product.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have tried especially for the price.  Unfortunately, in my new shower, the built-in shelves are not tall enough to accomodate this giant bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have written on here, but I feel compelled to share with you how great this conditioner is. I cannot say enough good things about it. I used to spend a fortune on conditioner. I tried this when I was visiting my sister.  I swear it is exactly the same product as Bumble &amp; Bumble Super Rich Conditioner. It&#x27;s supper thick, has very high end ingredients, inexpensive and, most importantly, leaves my hair looking AMAZING! I don&#x27;t even have a Costco membership (I&#x27;m single and don&#x27;t often buy in bulk), but I go with a friend when ever I am even close to running low on this stuff!</li>
    <li> Glad it&#x27;s gluten free but it smells a bit funny to me.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I, unfortunately, do not live near a costco so I had to buy here. May as well be the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; leaves my curly THICK hair feeling incredibly smooth. Someone mentioned that it didn&#x27;t have enough of a smell. This stuff smells STRONG and the scent lasts for several days.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner very much. I have my medium-long hair foil-highlighted every 2 months; each time I go to my stylist, I ask her opinion of how my hair is doing..she would tell me the truth, I&#x27;m sure, and since I&#x27;ve been using this product she says that my hair is in relatively good shape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this conditioner is lightweight yet has the ability to really silken your hair. On a day that I shower but feel I don&#x27;t need to shampoo, I will use a small amount, compared to a slightly larger amount on shampoo days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the scent of this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly buy this conditioner again.</li>
    <li> Works great with Kirkland Signature Shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a fantastic deal. The gossip on the internet is that it&#x27;s pureology behind it. It&#x27;s great for fine, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because i needed something that would moisturize and this conditioner left my hair feeling soft and silky after the very first use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good! Made my hair feel so healthy and softer then any other conditioners I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the kirkland shampoo and conditioner! I just ordered more! My kids also use the conditioner. Great for color treated hair like mine. Did not fade! Smells great and priced very affordably. Lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I have used Pureology for a couple years and tried the Kirkland brand because of all the reviews.  I actually find it more moisturizing than my Pureology products.  I have Brazilian straightener and color treated hair and this is the best conditioned I&#x27;ve found to date and the lowest price.</li>
    <li> I used this product without shampooing because i shampoo very other day so my hair doesnt dry out, but it was amazing! i have naturally curly, wavy, frizzy hair but it was calm and looked like i crimped it but it was all natural! could not live without this!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used twice, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I love it, it gets the job done, it&#x27;s vegan, no animal testing, great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned it&#x27;s cheaper at Costco. This is true, however Costco memberships are far from free and if (like me) you don&#x27;t have one, this is still a really good deal. They last forever.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same bottle for a year now. (I wash and condition my hair at least once a week.) The conditioner detangled my hair extremely well.( My hair is very kinky.) I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am a diagnosed Celiac. For years I have suffered with my hair and scalp.  I read this product is gluten free.  I have been using the condition daily in the shower after shampooing and also using a small amount as a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair cut right after starting this product and it is in excellent condition. I also so not have any scaling on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my extremely thick, dry, course and curly hair it has been a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> Conditions hair well but it is so strongly perfumed that you stink of it for days. Someone was not thinking straight while deciding formulation ratios in this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it every time I shower, and it leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I needed something very basic. This conditioner has made my hair very smooth, but has also helped with my skin condition. In the past I have had to use several different shampoos and conditioners back and forth, but now I have not had to change at all! I love this conditioner and will definitely be keeping it around!</li>
    <li> Works very well with my frizzy curly hair. I can easily comb through my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave build up. Good for drier hair type.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells nice (vanilla-y) and is creamy and thick (consistency is like lotion.) Stays in your hair and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for needing a gluten, corn, dairy free product. Did not react and I am super sensitive to products.</li>
