      <li>Scent was overwhelming.</li>
      <li>and they love the product</li>
      <li>This did not appear as anything special, but the smell...was nice...</li>
      <li>A very clean smell.</li>
      <li>A very pleasant scent and a very big bar.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s shaving soap for a couple years, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  </li>
      <li>but it is a HUGE bar.</li>
      <li>This product is well worth the price and Taylor of Old Bond Street has done a great job.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s a huge bar</li>
      <li>also enjoy the smell of the bathroom.</li>
      <li>There was no packing material around the product to secure it in the wrap.</li>
      <li>I enjoy all TOBS sandalwood products.</li>
      <li>It smells great and the scent doesn&#x27;t change over time like so many other soaps do.</li>
      <li>It lasts a very long time, Smells wonderful (even gives a lasting smell around the bathroom), and it suds and cleans better than many of those cheap store brands.</li>
      <li>No off color notes of scent, just sandalwood and clean.</li>
      <li>The scent is the same pleasant sandalwood I have come to expect.</li>
      <li>Smells good--but doesn&#x27;t last as long or smell as good as Mistral&#x27;s offering in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Still a very nice soap.</li>
      <li>Very nice, but mild fragrance as others have stated will not stay on long if that is what you prefer.  </li>
      <li>Many sandalwood soaps are adulterated with other scents, but this seems to be among the most authentic I have tried as of yet.</li>
      <li>The smell was great, but it gives you a tacky feeling like other bars of soap.</li>
      <li>Great gift addition to the other Taylor products I have purchased for my husband.</li>
      <li>Love it, goes great with the aftershave and cologne, layering makes the overall scent last all day.</li>
      <li>The scent of it is fresh and invigorating in a morning shower.</li>
      <li>This soap smells nothing short of spectacular</li>
      <li>I am the kind of person who can actually become offended at the way a lot of people smell.  </li>
      <li>At first when I got the box I thought it was used because the corners were frayed and smashed</li>
      <li>I really love this soap, not only is it quite large, but the sandalwood scent is strong enough so that you can smell it after the shower.</li>
      <li>The smell also isn&#x27;t too strong and it actually lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Huge bar of soap that I will definitely be reordering as needed.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced for its quality.</li>
      <li>I found my brand of cigarettes much easier</li>
      <li>If you are an overgrown man boy that still wearing your hat backwards and chasing girls that don&#x27;t know any better, maybe your not ready for this product.</li>
      <li>Really, try it.</li>
      <li>It produces a fresh clean end result and lathers extremely well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who likes sandalwood.</li>
      <li>very masculine, my wife wont let me where anything else.</li>
      <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street is one of the finest men&#x27;s products in the world, without exagerration!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand when people cover themselves in a fragrance I can taste while sitting near their table in a restaurant.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Taylor of Old Bond Street&amp;#34; it engraved on the soap, and it is in an oblong shape.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was bigger, goes fast</li>
      <li>The soap has an old-fashioned masculine scent.</li>
      <li>Unlike the mens body washes and soaps on the market today that openly advertise that you will smell like a man whore this soap is subtile and masculine.  </li>
      <li>I only wish they could capture the same scent as the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.</li>
      <li>The price is higher then I would have expected for a single bar of soap</li>

<li> The only reason I docked it a star is because it took a long time to get here</li>
<li> The bar should last a long time.  </li>
<li> smells nice, but a little on the expensive side.</li>
<li> Lasts a long time .</li>
<li> Will definitely be buying this again, as well as trying their other soaps.</li>
<li> : The product crashed around in the over-wrap like a loose marble in a coffee can.  </li>
<li> I have hard water where i live</li>

<li> Nice product, but it appeared to have been by packed by malevolent gnomes.  </li>
<li> But since I can&#x27;t stand the smell of the soaps she usually buys I really only docked it the star because of the long shipping time.</li>
<li> then my brand of soap, that said I think this will be harder to quit.</li>
<li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> This soap will cause you to feel very fresh without annoying scents that mimic the scent of a woman.</li>
<li> After the shower it doesn&#x27;t smell like you&#x27;ve simply masked your dirty butt in obnoxious fragrance.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Soap feels nice on my skin and smells great.</li>
    <li> Great soap. It smells great. I have hard water where i live and i always felt like the soap would never rinse off. That being said, since using this soap, my skin feels great. Also, it&#x27;s a huge bar so i think it&#x27;ll last me a while.</li>
    <li> This soap smells nothing short of spectacular</li>
    <li> Been looking for a substitute because the company I was buying from discontinued their sandalwood soap. My husband likes this soap just as well.</li>
    <li> Very nice lathers nicley</li>
    <li> I found my brand of cigarettes much easier then my brand of soap, that said I think this will be harder to quit. Lathers like a dream, and smells perfect! If your a fan of Taylors shaving cream then this is defiantly for you! The price is higher then I would have expected for a single bar of soap but it is a HUGE bar. Will definitely be buying this again, as well as trying their other soaps.</li>
    <li> very masculine, my wife wont let me where anything else.</li>
    <li> Smells good--but doesn&#x27;t last as long or smell as good as Mistral&#x27;s offering in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Still a very nice soap.</li>
    <li> Four stars,nice smell</li>
    <li> It smells great. Huge bar of soap that I will definitely be reordering as needed.  If you like people that get close to you telling you how good you smell, then you will love this soap.</li>
    <li> If you want to spoil yourself in the tub or shower, this soap is luxurious</li>
    <li> Probably the best Sandalwood soap I&#x27;ve purchased. No off color notes of scent, just sandalwood and clean.</li>
    <li> Love it, goes great with the aftershave and cologne, layering makes the overall scent last all day. I just wish it was bigger, goes fast</li>
    <li> and good value for 200Gm</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this soap. Big, big fan. It lasts a very long time, Smells wonderful (even gives a lasting smell around the bathroom), and it suds and cleans better than many of those cheap store brands. The only reason I docked it a star is because it took a long time to get here and my wife isn&#x27;t a fan of the smell at all. But since I can&#x27;t stand the smell of the soaps she usually buys I really only docked it the star because of the long shipping time. I would have only docked it a half a star if I could though.</li>
    <li> This did not appear as anything special, but the smell...was nice...and I could even smell it a month later at the tail end of the bar.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but it appeared to have been by packed by malevolent gnomes.  The bar was in a slim cardboard box, and that was in a simple corrugated over-wrap, which was four times the size of the soap bar.  There was no packing material around the product to secure it in the wrap. Result #1: The product crashed around in the over-wrap like a loose marble in a coffee can.  Result #2: When I pulled it out, the $10.00 bar of soap looked like a nickle wad of discarded chewing gum.  This is not way to serve customers who pay for and expect quality.</li>
    <li> Unlike the mens body washes and soaps on the market today that openly advertise that you will smell like a man whore this soap is subtile and masculine.  It produces a fresh clean end result and lathers extremely well. After the shower it doesn&#x27;t smell like you&#x27;ve simply masked your dirty butt in obnoxious fragrance.  I am the kind of person who can actually become offended at the way a lot of people smell.  I can&#x27;t stand when people cover themselves in a fragrance I can taste while sitting near their table in a restaurant.  If you are a Gent, this is for you.  If you are an overgrown man boy that still wearing your hat backwards and chasing girls that don&#x27;t know any better, maybe your not ready for this product.</li>
    <li> Rich lather great aroma .  Lasts a long time .</li>
    <li> Love the bar! also enjoy the smell of the bathroom. I will be purchasing another bar soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s shaving soap for a couple years, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  The bath soap is similar, but I find it lackluster as a soap.  The scent is the same pleasant sandalwood I have come to expect.</li>
    <li> A very pleasant scent and a very big bar. Not as impressed as I thought I would be for 14 bucks.</li>
    <li> I really love this soap, not only is it quite large, but the sandalwood scent is strong enough so that you can smell it after the shower.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised. Great scent, squeaky clean performance.&lt;br /&gt;A perfect addition to the Sandalwood Shaving Cream. Really, try it.</li>
    <li> This is an elegant bar of soap. Great aroma. Good feel in the hands.</li>
    <li> Scent was overwhelming. Sent it back.</li>
    <li> At first when I got the box I thought it was used because the corners were frayed and smashed but that could have been done from shipping and handiling, otherwise the soap was in tact and protected with a piece of wax paper. The &amp;#34;Taylor of Old Bond Street&amp;#34; it engraved on the soap, and it is in an oblong shape. The fragrance is pleasant, it makes you want to smell yourself every minute, and people will give you compliments. This product is well worth the price and Taylor of Old Bond Street has done a great job. The way this will make you feel is a cross between a J.D Rockefeller and Howard Hughes.</li>
    <li> For me, this soap is awesome. It smells great and the scent doesn&#x27;t change over time like so many other soaps do. Maybe it&#x27;s some kind of body chemistry thing but, who cares, it works for me. It may be different for different people so you&#x27;d probably just have to try it out and see how it works for you. The smell also isn&#x27;t too strong and it actually lasts all day. I can even smell it still after work when I go to my yoga class and it stills smells the same. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that a little goes a long way. I only need to lather up a wash rag once and then put the soap back on the dish and use the wash rag for my entire body. I think I was wasting a lot of it in the past by using the actual bar along with the wash rag when I didn&#x27;t really need to.</li>
    <li> The soap has an old-fashioned masculine scent. Just a touch on your washcloth to get a great amount of lather. The bar should last a long time.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> A very clean smell. I enjoy all TOBS sandalwood products. I own the cologne, aftershave, aftershave gel, shaving cream, and yes the soap too. This soap will cause you to feel very fresh without annoying scents that mimic the scent of a woman. This is a gentlemen&#x27;s fragranced soap. Gets some!</li>
    <li> A great product and fast service!</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance.  I only wish they could capture the same scent as the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This was part of the gift set I purchased for someone and they love the product so it was excellent choice.</li>
    <li> I like sandalwood. The scent of it is fresh and invigorating in a morning shower. Women remark &amp;#34;Hey You smell GREAT&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Many sandalwood soaps are adulterated with other scents, but this seems to be among the most authentic I have tried as of yet. It&#x27;s very strong smelling, but refreshingly so. I highly recommend this for anyone who likes sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and lather. Took a star off because of the price.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street is one of the finest men&#x27;s products in the world, without exagerration!</li>
    <li> Great smell for baths.</li>
    <li> The smell was great, but it gives you a tacky feeling like other bars of soap. Overall 4 stars for  smell if your used to bar soap then i would deffenitly give it a try!</li>
    <li> This was the perfect gift for someone - nice scent  for a man.</li>
    <li> smells nice, but a little on the expensive side.</li>
    <li> Great gift addition to the other Taylor products I have purchased for my husband.</li>
    <li> Very nice, but mild fragrance as others have stated will not stay on long if that is what you prefer.  Good lather, nice size with no residue, a clean feeling. Reasonably priced for its quality.</li>
