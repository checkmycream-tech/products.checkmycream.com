<li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, plus the cream is expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years, and notice a difference in the brightness, smoothness and evenness of my skin color.  It also firms and moisturizes.  People always tell me I look younger than my age, which is 60.  I will continue Cellex-C.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly in excellent condition.  A fantastic cream I have used for years. One of the best you can use to renew aging skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this Vitamin C cream for several years now.  I consider it one of my two most indispensable facial care essentials.  It is the strongest formula of Vitamin C available.  It&#x27;s totally non-greasy and is really wonderful at tightening your skin.  (Use after toner and under moisturizing lotions and creams. It absorbs immediately and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem seems to be the company&#x27;s need to improve the plastic covering under the lid.  Twice now quite a bit of the cream has oozed out of the jar into the box during shipping.  Thus, the cream had to be returned and reordered.  Amazon needs to work with the Canadian manufacture to improve their inside-the-jar plastic seal.  I suggest that they look into the better quality cover that Gary Null uses in his Ageless Answer Cream for an idea. In addition, that type of inside cover can continue to be left under the lid to better protect the cream and keep it from further oxidizing as it is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mj Gillespie</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST Vitamin C cream around.  It has Ascorbic Acid in it which is pure Vitamin C AND it has a good amount in it, as it is listed as the 2nd ingredient!  I love it!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and I am routinely told I look like I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;m 49!</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care product I have used on my face. Several years ago my dermatologist recommended this and I have been  using it since then. It visibly Improves the texture of your skin, I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used other products and gotten some good results but those products were full of chemical compounds I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  I am back to the one who started it all and can honestly say how happy I am when I see the results.</li>
    <li> I like this face cream.  I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy it again as I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to see any serious results.  Also, I had read reviews complaining about the smell and I was a bit worried it was going to smell horrid.  But, it doesn&#x27;t!  I don&#x27;t find it offensive at all.  My skin tingles a bit once applied, but that quickly dissipates.  Be careful not to get it close to the eye area as it will burn (I learned the hard way).</li>
    <li> Cellex-C cream works! The vitamin-c can sting a bit on the first application, but the results are worth it. After just a few weeks application (at night) my skin is luminous. Sunspots fade away with the dead skin cells and leave a very youthful glow. I only use half the moisturizer I used to. Wrinkles disappeared or minimized, even the deep one between my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, plus the cream is expensive.</li>
    <li> I received this jar of cream damaged.  Some of the cream had excaped from the jar via an untightened lid.  I wrote whoever sent this a note asking for a new jar or just my money back.  I haven&#x27;t heard from them yet.  After these last couple of experiences it seems safer to order from the source of Cellex-c in Canada.  Mimi Bernier</li>
    <li> simply amazing cream for performance and radiance and firming!!!</li>
    <li> Non-irritating and keeps my skin soft and free of fine lines. I get a lot of complements on my skin from men and women. A little expensive, but don&#x27;t need to use a lot and it lasts for about 60 applications. I can&#x27;t say it tightened my skin, but no product would. That requires a plastic surgeon.</li>
    <li> I love this product it cleared my face no more pimples the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price it&#x27;s very expensive that&#x27;s why I only give 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to love this one. The price was significantly cheaper (about 50% less) than the same product at my local SPA. Unfortunately, the use-by date on it was only 6/2014 and the cream smells and looks a little off already. Tempted to go to the SPA and show it to them to compare to the ones they carry.</li>
    <li> Felt tightening on the initial application. Hope that progress is constant, consistent and visible.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 20 years and love it and the results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It has kept my skin looking great.  Really helps prevent wrinkles and small lines.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this crème.  Only a little bit is needed on the face so the jar will last a long time.  This cream gave me immediately results.  Like overnight, my mom came up to visit me over the holidays and started using the small amount I had remaining in my old jar, she feel in love with it, I could really see a healthy glow to her face from one day to the next, she asked me &amp;#34;is it me or is this some good stuff&amp;#34;.  So I purchased another jar and well she took it back to Florida.  LOL! Cant say no to mom, so I purchased another jar, its pretty pricey but I don&#x27;t mind paying for something that works.  It really does what it says and that&#x27;s not always easy to find in a beauty product.  All of the cellex-c products I have used have been pretty good but this one is the main one that I do not want to run out of.  I use it on my face neck about 4-5 times a week so this jar easily last me about 5-6 months.</li>
    <li> I was REALLY hoping for the promised miracles here...at $100 a pop, I think we all are.  But I have oily skin, even at 61 and I have to be careful of just how I moisturize or I will instantly break out or develop a greasy shine or HORRORS, both.  So, I am very careful about what I put on my skin.  Phillip Thomas Roth products have proven amazing so why I deviated I don&#x27;t know, but I did and now I am out $100 for my cheating....this goes on well enough, but then doesn&#x27;t really soak INTO the skin, because the next morning, I am ready to fry eggs on my skin using this.  I see no difference in the tone, texture or tightness either...so, lesson learned.  When you find something that works well enough, don&#x27;t go chasing waterfalls......or you&#x27;ll get drenched..as I did with this purchase...</li>
    <li> The cream was inappropriately rotten, discolored and smelly. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t keep the receipt for returning.&lt;br /&gt;It was a waist of dollars and effort!</li>
    <li> So glad to find this product at Amazon; I can&#x27;t live without it. The only product I&#x27;ve used for over ten years and it is a true &amp;#34;line reducer&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The jar should be opaque as light oxidizes the vitatmin C changing the color to brown, making the vitamin C less effective.</li>
    <li> I returned the item immediately. The cream was close to its expiration date. When I opened the jar, the cream just spurted out of the jar and it smelled rancid. I have bought this product many times and I know, for a fact, how it should look and how it should smell, when it is a fresh. I will start buying the product from the Cellex-C website. It may cost more; but maybe, just maybe, I won&#x27;t have to go through the hassle of returning the cream.</li>
    <li> I used Cellex-C years ago and had exceptional results.  I stopped using it and that is my biggest regret.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone who wants a youthful, healthy skin.....at any age.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Cellex-C</li>
    <li> Love this cream-best cream ever!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been overly impressed with  tighning results.  Good moisturizer and very nice smelling with citrus and orange blossom fragrance.</li>
    <li> Cellex-C makes amazing products. I recommend them all. You will notice a difference right away. you wont regret buying them</li>
    <li> I recently bought this cream, and after a week my skin feels softer, more radiant and younger.  It also has a pleasant fragrance. I would recommend this cream and intend to buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using cellex - C for years and have seen good results and will continue to use this product...</li>
    <li> It truly works.  Ive been using this product for several weeks now.  I store it in a cool, dark drawer, not in the bathroom.  I have been numerously complimented that I am 52, and &amp;#34; don&#x27;t have visable wrinkles&amp;#34;.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 10 years and there is no substitute! It evens out the skin tone, tightens up the skin and gets rid off fine wrinkles.Highly recomend to anyone! Start early, prevention counts the most. It does not feel great, stings lightly but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Love this product and have used it faithfully for over 10 years-my skin shows this!</li>
    <li> this is the best product i have used for the firming of my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It makes my skin feel so smooth. The product states that it takes up to two months to see the total effect so do not expect overnight tightening.  The moisture in my skin is now wonderful.  Tiny lines have disappeared around my eyes.  I am allergic to everything and this product did not give me any reactions.  So far so good. It has only been a couple of weeks that I have been using it.</li>
    <li> Been a customer for years. Highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I always come back to this.  Always.  Sometimes--especially when I have too many glasses of wine--I find myself being drawn in to the promise of youth at a fraction of the cost.  Perhaps we are all guilty of that at some point in our lives.  I was recommended Cellex-C by my dermatologist back in the late 1990s.  I balked a little at the price, but eventually caved.  Since 1999 I have tried cheaper.  I have tried acid peels.  I have tried LED lights.  I have tried Botox.  I always, always come back to this.  I am 60, going on 42.  Run--do not walk--to get your Cellex-C.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was as expected.  I am 53 with not the best skin but it has helped and is the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> As always, I expect miracles! But really? This stuff is as close to a miracle as a person could get. I did see results after about 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> great product for mature skin</li>
    <li> I have used various Cellex-C products for a few years.  This one does it all!  Tightens, brightens, reduces wrinkles and more.  I am addicted to great skin and the many tricks to get it.  Along with Cellex-c Skin Tightening Cream, I use Clarisonic, a toner to get your skin back to proper ph  after cleansing and a new trick I have learnt...don&#x27;t wash your face in the morning.  We spend all night building a protective layer just to wash it off in the morning.  My face is actually less oily all day because it is not trying to recover.  Just splash off your face.  I still dab on a toner and use morning anti-aging products.

This plumps your skin and helps  all your expensive products be even more effective.</li>
    <li> I know it says it is not for acne, but I&#x27;ve been using it with benzol peroxide for 2 years now and it has COMPLETELY transformed my skin.  My acne has cleared up and the elasticity of my skin is phenomenal!  I call it my miracle jar.  I put it on every night and it continues to do wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> You can tell the difference in your skin in about 3 weeks. The product itself is VERY good but be sure to shop around for the best price.</li>
    <li> I have used Cellex C Skin Tightening Cream twice daily since receipt and it definitely works.</li>
    <li> More than pleased with initial experience.  While results take time, the first two weeks of application yielded results which far exceeded any expectations!  Recommended to all seeking wrinkle relief--absolutely without hesitation!  Nancy</li>
