<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very nice... works well</li>
    <li> This straightening brush is soooo awesome! It works really well with just about any kind of hair texture. It doesn&#x27;t snag your hair and it really helps get your hair straighter. I love it!</li>
    <li> This a excellent product, no need for a flat iron.  You hair comes out perfectly straight using this brush.</li>
    <li> I am Black and I have extremely thick hair.  This brush seems to work well for me so far.  My hair does seem straighter than when I was using a different brush for drying my hair.  No complaints, good investment.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair but I can&#x27;t even pull this brush through it wet or dry. I will keep trying to see what else i can do.</li>
    <li> This little brush has saved my hair....and I have problematic curly hair, frizzy, a few split ends etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never use my flat iron anymore, though it can be used with your flat iron to keep the hair smooth and straight as it&#x27;s passing through those hot plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I dry my hair a little, then I section off my hair and together with my regular travel sized blowdryer, I get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a Conair InfinitiPro Air Rotating Styler that I use afterwards to give me that &#x27;just walked out of the salon look\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a must have tool for us ladies with less than perfect hair</li>
    <li> This brush is great! It&#x27;s the only tool I can use to truly pull my uber-curly hair straight, especially my bangs. This brush feels a little heavy in your hand because it&#x27;s pretty substantial and I like that. It grips hair well, but doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re ripping it out. The brush part is also a very nice, convenient size.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because a friend recommended this type of brush to blow dry my very thick hair mixed race hair. It does not glide through my hair smoothly as I would have liked. I ended up borrowing my friend&#x27;s european brand ceramic brush which worked better than this one. I believe it was because the bristles were longer. This brush is better for thinner hair gals.</li>
    <li> left my hair so frizzy. My hair is thin and fine. I would just use a round ceramic brush without boar bristles. Works a lot better</li>
    <li> Works great so far, I&#x27;m still getting used to how to grab the hair while I&#x27;m holding the dryer at the same time. I have really thick hair and I tend to grab more hair than I really want.  I think it&#x27;s just a learning curve for me.  Over all I really like the brush.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used a straightening brush after I saw a youtube video on Keratin Hair treatment at home. I have used it only one time so far and it really works well. I could never blow dry my own hair but this brush makes it really easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use this while flat ironing my hair. Rather than straightening one bug clump of hair, I put this product on a section of hair, then put the straightener ON TOP of this brush, then pull the brush and iron down at the same time (if you don&#x27;t known what I&#x27;m talking about, look up the &amp;#34;chase method&amp;#34; of hair straightening). The result is every strand of hair is straightened in ONE PASS. So happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have a teen with an extremely messy room and wavy long hair...not a good mix for allowing an electric flat iron to be added to that dynamic.  So I opted for this version.  It seems like it will create some flatness to her hair, probably not as professional as a flat iron, but that&#x27;s just not an option right now.  I plan to help her with it when she really wants it to work, so with that better angle and some appropriate hair product, I think I will be able to get some really good results.  I&#x27;ll try to update later on the best techniques!</li>
    <li> Nothing about this product was ergonomically friendly.  Awkward to use on thick long hair and cumbersome. Not worth the investment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Good for straightening hair,</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
    <li> Straightening hair is easier and looks better than professional when I use this.</li>
    <li> I guess it might work for some of you. But to me its a bit awkward to use or maybe I am awkward. In any case I need another pair of hands to be able to use it.</li>
    <li> The reason why I bought this was because I went to a salon while visiting Denver and the cosmetologist used this while blowing out my hair reaping great results :) Now I&#x27;m not a fan of blow drying my hair but I do like to flat iron my hair straight once or twice a month. I find that I get the best results when I use another tool to first smooth my hair directly before flat ironing it (referred to as the \\&quot;chasing method\\&quot; from what I recently discovered).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I initially used a fine tooth comb to smooth my hair and then transitioned to a Denman brush I still found that I had to use either (a) too much tension to get all the hair or (b) too many slides of the flat iron to get my hair as smooth as I prefer and while seeing the cosmetologist use this little tool I was mentally convinced that this would be perfect for my needs LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welllll....I got this brush and can I say WOW!!! This worked soooo good and got my hair soooo smooth! I was very happy and I AM very happy with this product and can&#x27;t wait to use it again :)</li>
    <li> Great, my natural curly hair needs some TLC some days to not resemble a birds nest. This is great, I don&#x27;t have to use the heated flat iron when I use this. I can even use it on damp hair.</li>
    <li> This tool has enhanced my flat ironing regiment.  Using this brush, along with a flat iron, has cut my flat ironing time in half.  I now only have to use my flat iron one or two passes.  I would suggest combing through the hair  first as t to not cause breakage.</li>
    <li> A very good product an very useful</li>
    <li> Difficult to blowdry with. Other reviews I read said it works great when used with a straightening iron and thats true, it does. If you have short hair you can use it for blowdrying styles but if your hair is long like mine, too difficult a task.</li>
    <li> This actually worked for my long curly frizzy Latina hair but you have to literally keep it infront of the hairdryer. It does leave my hair weightless and nice and shinny.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like this and it is inconvenient to use.  I am too lazy to bother with packing it up and paying for shipping, so I guess I&#x27;ll either keep it or it will wind up in the &amp;#34;To go to the thrift shop&amp;#34; pile.  If there is another way to straighten hair out there that is pretty easy while drying the hair, I would love a recommendation.</li>
    <li> Sucks. Cheap piece of plastic</li>
    <li> Wow I&#x27;m so in the with this it is amazing.  My hair never looked this great !!! Don&#x27;t know what I will do without it .. I just love love love this</li>
    <li> I am a licensed hair stylist and I love using this on my clients with wavy or frizzy hair! Great buy and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> This brush is very good, I have thick hair and funky and it really does its job, the iron hurt you to buy here I think I served bad wine that does not heat</li>
    <li> I like it, just need to get used to using it properly. More practice.  May purchase one for my daughter too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use heat with this brush because I don&#x27;t own a hair dryer and because I am well aware that applying heat to the hair can damage it more than hair dyes.  It does make my African American hair more manageable and lengthens the strands out.  I bought a brush like this after researching the Mason Pearson line of hair brushes.  I learned that I would not be able to use any oils with the Mason Pearson brushes because oil would ruin the rubber backing.  The manufacturers of  the Scalpmaster have designed it to be used with any oil based hair product.</li>
    <li> honestly right now the brush is somewhere under my bed...idk maybe you need someone else to help you in order for it to actually work good, i feel like one i grab my hair with it, it just yanks it and it hurts, idk i wont be using it anytime soon, i&#x27;m just thinking about throwing it away or giving it to someone who might be able to use it the proper way</li>
    <li> This little brush really did a great job of straightening my curly fine hair.......grip your hair with the brush at the roots just hold the blow dryer and aim it at your hair and the brush.....and pull it through to the ends.  Then you can just curl it with a curling iron, or go over it to make it even smoother with a flat iron for wearing it straight.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick hair and I hate the blowdrying process but with rhis product I don&#x27;t mund and neither does she</li>
    <li> This is a good product when styling my daughters hair.  I need a third hand when trying to style my own.</li>
    <li> Very, very pleased with thermal brush! I have natural hair and this brush did amazing along with my flat iron. It came secured, on time, and not damaged.</li>
    <li> Does not work on shorter hair.  Right now my hair is about 3 inches long and I was hoping to use this to help straighten it gently as it is new hair, grown back following chemo.  No luck.  Hair just as curly as before.  Brush is useless as a straightener.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d use this much, but I really do use it all of the time.  I watched a few demonstration videos and decided to purchase it since it wasn&#x27;t too expensive.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  This works very well with my Titanium Tools straightener.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at how much I love this!  I thought I&#x27;d try it because the price is right.  I don&#x27;t often blow out my long hair, but I tried this and it straightened nicely.  I don&#x27;t press the brush completely closed or it pulls a bit too much.  It does easily spring open.  It does not pull out any hair, either.  I use a lighter touch but still with enough tension to keep the lock straight.  It takes a long time to blow dry my waist length hair, but this is something I&#x27;ll use when I have that much time.</li>
    <li> Is easy to manage and dry the hair and make it straight, I definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;the only bad thing is that sometimes I can burn my hand with the heat</li>
    <li> Awesome! I&#x27;m new at trying to maneuver this brush &amp; blow dryer at the same time, but its worth the work b/c this brush adds a moist and silky feel to the hair that the blow drying used to take away.</li>
    <li> The bristles are very hard which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. It may take a few uses to really give the best review.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman and my daughter and I have different lengths of relaxed hair. Using this tool was akward and I didn&#x27;t find it to do much more than using my yellow bird with the comb attachment. It made the drying time take so much longer and I still had to follow up with a flat iron on my daughter&#x27;s hair after using this. I ended up purposely tearing it apart to make two hair brushes out of it instead.</li>
    <li> muy bueno, exelente, magnifico!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;este producto nunca falta entre las cosas de toda mujer, les encanta cuidarse y verse lindas para sus esposos</li>
    <li> Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;If you ae looking for something to help striaghten your hair...use this product with your flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;One pass of this magic little brush along with your iron (put this brush right next to your flat iron and pull them both through the hair at the same time..brush going first) will give you stright wonderful hair. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Explanation of product was not told correctly..leaves hair frizzy..does not work. Why do I have to write more. I said what I needed to</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for straightening naturally curly hair.  The bristles of the brush are strong and soft, so they cause the tension that my hair needs to straighten out, but also reduces frizz because of the softness.</li>
    <li> So far, so good, I&#x27;ve only used it once but my hair came out nicely...takes a little longer than my regular brush but the blow out might last longer too...</li>
    <li> Yay!  I think I&#x27;ve finally found a brush that&#x27;s stronger than my cowlick, which is THE strongest cowlick in the entire world!  I&#x27;ve only used this brush once so far but my cowlick is finally laying flat and I don&#x27;t look like a dork anymore!  : )</li>
    <li> stop using the comb attachment to get African American hair silky straight! This brush stretches and detangles the hair and combined with the heat from ANY quality hair dryer and tension you can get the hair very straight! Take your time and smaller sections this will make flat ironing a breeze (if you want to after!)</li>
    <li> I saw something like this on YouTube where this girl would use this type of double brush to hold strands of her hair will straightening her hair. I have FOUR girls and we all straighten our hair so for this cheap price I decided to buy it and try it. Well... I LOVE IT! It brushes my strands and helps keep them straight while i apply heat with my straightener. It definitely helps! I 10x recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> The bristles got ruined very quickly and i had to stop using it. Wouldnt work anymore.</li>
    <li> Pros: works great in my chin length hair.  I have coarse medium thickness hair.  VERY frizzy.  I have to straighten bc my sides are wavy but my back is kinky curl!  Never looks good this short curly.  I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron, my hair is so nice and thick and body and NO frizz after I finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: bristles do come out pretty easily, not sure how long before I will need to replace.  It takes a few times to get the hang of it.  But probably takes same amount of time it took me before to blow dry with regular brush then flat iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more i use the brush the easier it is to handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my older one which broke at the joint/hinge(?)  Anyway, this one has holes for airflow and heats up pretty quickly so it get the job done faster and looks more natural.  My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t open all that much, the picture is the max so you need 2 hands to place the hair on the bristles (if that makes sense..) but I guess I just have to get used to it...  otherwise, great product.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because it works without frying my hair with a hot iron. The vents allow me to dry my bangs very quickly with a blow dryer.  A must have for curly hair. Eliminates frizz.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, it works great with my flat Conair hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This helps to  cut down time when I straighten my natural curly hair, it usually takes four(4) hours including drinking water breaks to  straighten my hair this helps a lot. the heat from the flat iron hasn&#x27;t burned/damaged it yet!. purchased September 2012</li>
    <li> Genius! Cuts straightening my thick coarse curly hair down by half for my whole head! One pass with the straighter right behind this brush and my hair is silky straight.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have found this years ago!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great aid in blow drying and flat ironing thick coarse hair. I have used this on my daughter and a couple of my clients with thicker hair and it&#x27;s a time saver. I can get near flat iron straight hair with this and a blow dryer alone so I can opt to actually flat iron or curl hair on a lower heat setting. (A huge benefit for both natural and relaxed African American hair).&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution is that the bristles are very stiff so you will want to use this on smaller sections of hair and use a little amount of tension or you&#x27;ll pull out and/or break off hair.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret or issue is that it&#x27;s no good on short hair. I hope there is a narrower version I could use. The box it came it was mangled and ripped up but the brush was in perfect shape fortunately. Did have a odd smell but I wash all my tools before and/or after styling regularly so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Very handy tool if you are a used to manipulating multiple styling tools at once.</li>
    <li> Well, I have to say overall this is a good product - does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do. Here&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it a 3 instead of a 4 or 5:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde, straight hair to begin with, but the kind of straight that isn&#x27;t really STRAIGHT, if you know what I mean. Still needs a quick straightening if I want to make it look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- While I do sometimes use this to get at the desired effect, it doesn&#x27;t really replace the need for a flatiron. Not for the really finished look. It&#x27;ll get me part way there and maybe help it lay a little nicer, so I do sometimes use it. But not nearly as often as I thought I would when I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a little uncomfortable to hold... kind of have to choke up on it to get a good grip, but you can&#x27;t hold too far up or you&#x27;ll burn yourself on the ceramic once it&#x27;s hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I think the bristles are a little too long... if they were shorter it might be more effective. You already have to pick up smallish chunks of hair to put in there, so if the ceramic could clamp together a little tighter I think it would make more of a difference in straightening your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent product, especially for the price - just not everything I hoped for.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. It gets my thick curly hair straight with just a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I use this to straighten my very curly hair and it always turns out sleek and shiny. Although, I sometimes feel like I&#x27;m yanking out my hair in the process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes for a long time but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered online.  Delivered on time and as described</li>
    <li> Very good quality and SO helpful! I bought 2 hair straightener brushes. This one and &amp;#34;Diane Straightening Brush&amp;#34;. The latter one just started falling apart at first use.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would have the bristles that are more solid and separate versus these which are more like soft hair-like bristles. They don&#x27;t reach through my thick, wiry hair well and it feels like it just stretches the hair instead of combing and holding it straight to dry. It results in frizz. I was hoping to find something that was more like multiple rows of combs.  The ceramic bristle holders do get hot so you have to be coordinated. Overall it was a bit awkward to use on myself, but probably easier to use on someone else.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this--It&#x27;s too hard to clamp it on your&lt;br /&gt;hair while using the blowdryer in the other hand.</li>
    <li> Fabulous tool!!! I am always struggling with the flat iron, burning my fingers with the hot strands of hair. This straightener brush does more than protect, it helps with the blow dryer and/or the flat iron. Highly Recommended!!</li>
    <li> i dont know how to use it properly, but it has good grasp</li>
    <li> I love these types of brushes because it makes it easy to straighten my hair while blow drying. I just wish it were a bit more narrow.</li>
    <li> Well, it certainly straightens, but it generates so much static electricity that my hair sticks out like I&#x27;ve rubbed a latex balloon on my hair. You&#x27;ll need some styling product to smooth your hair out for sure. Also, its such a tight grip that its sort of painful especially around the temples. But, I had a friend who had crazy thick curly hair, so I know there are certain hair types out there that would probably feel like this was well worth the effort. I&#x27;ll stick with my big roller brush.</li>
    <li> Not good as I thaught it would be</li>
    <li> Its ok... only used it a hand full of times while flat ironing.. wish it would&#x27;ve came on time instead of getting lost in the mail and waiting month for nothing...</li>
    <li> A must have when flat ironing.</li>
    <li> But I am sure I will like this product. Hopefully it will smooth my hair out more. Can&#x27;t waot to try it</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t open up  as wide as I expected but its mmmmmkkkkkaaayyy.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Amazing experience with the seller. Item arrived ahead of schedule and was exactly what we asked for. Thanks!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This brush straightens the hair but I don&#x27;t think the hair is as shiny after using it as when using a round brush. It is probably because with a round brush, you can keep rotating it as you dry the hair. If I had one of those hair dryer stands, I could keep going over a section of hair untill it is shiny because I would have both hands to work with instead of having to hold the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like the brush and use it sometimes but I touch up my hair with a flat iron after I use it to give it a sleeker look.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush after struggling to straighten my very thick curly Peruvian hair. It seemed like no matter what product or straightener I used it still got puffy by the end of the day. I purchased this brush after watching a girl with similar hair straighten her hair using this. WOW it worked my hair is super soft and now does not get tangled and puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by washing my hair and drying it. Then I brushed and straightened at the same time pulling the brush down a strand of hair following with the straightener. I absolutely love this brush. I will continue to use it and might even order a second one just to make sure I always have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brush is great. The handle is nice with a very good grip. The brush its self is overall a great quality product. I recommend this brush to anyone who has very thick curly or wavy hair and has trouble straightening it&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NJE14E Scalpmaster Ceramic Thermal Hair Straightener]]</li>
    <li> It makes straightening my hair a lot easier! I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Light weight, excellent for use with my flat iron. It started to peel a bit after a couple of months of use, but the bristles are still in good condition.</li>
    <li> This tool is super convenient! I see salons use the comb &amp;#34;chasing method&amp;#34; by placing a comb in front of the flat iron when straightening. This is just a [better] brush version. I saw a girl on YouTube (http://youtu.be/XZaco9uzcvc) use one like this with a Keratin treatment and wanted to try it. SO glad I did! I am not the most coordinated, so the comb method was a fail. This one springs back open and requires minimal coordination, It can hold the hair as firmly as needed to give you the tension needed to get your roots straight. Reduce the tension by not squeezing so hard as you bring the brush down on the strand. I used this for my own keratin treatment (and you know how important getting your hair straight is with those). I was delighted! My jaw even dropped when I did my first pass. I was stoked! I now plan to use it for regular flat ironing too. (P.S. I flat ironed w/ the Bellezza titanium flat iron - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TVK3W/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1.) A+ on both!</li>
    <li> I love this!!! Perfect straight hair! I have a lottt of hair and also curly... And it works wonders!! It saves me a lot of time as well.</li>
    <li> The feel is very synthetic, but for straightening hair is a good design. My hair is long and thick, and I could use longer bristles, but with patience and dedication, I can take smaller strands and move faster. A must for everyone that wants a quick change of look without going to the salon.</li>
    <li> Just received thank u</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected. I got better results using the comb chase method.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have very thick hair, which made me wary of buying this product, especially online. However, it pulled through and I could not ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> I dried my hair in half of the time that it use to take me. It is silky smooth. I do have really thick hair so a quick flat iron is needed afterwards only if i want to let my hair down that day. It was a great buy and i would definitely recommend it to any else.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush about almost five months ago since I really wanted one in substitution for an old, extremely cheap one that broke after the third use or so. This is probably the best brush ever. I have long hair, and it&#x27;s thick as well. I follow the instructions to it and put it in a low heat setting just so it maintains itself. I pass it a strand of hair a couple of times (either wet or dry) and use a a normal straighter just once over it and VOILA! My hair is straighten and it stays like that ALL DAY (or until I tie it up). It&#x27;s obvious that you have to pass it a few times in your hair, and one at first isn&#x27;t accustomed to it so it takes a bit longer to work with it. But honestly, I don&#x27;t regret buying it. I love taking my time with this to make my hair perfect because it really makes my hair last a long time, unlike a normal hair dryer brush (which I despise). I would definitely buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I do like this hair straightener, I used it for my Brazilian hair and it worked fine but I did have to go over the hair a couple of times to get it bone straight like I desired it to be. But That may be just cause I haven&#x27;t fully mastered the skill yet.</li>
    <li> Works great gives good shine but started bending with heat now it doesn&#x27;t sit as tightly together and I wish it had a lock so don&#x27;t have to hold it closed</li>
    <li> i use this on my hair to pull it taught and follow with my blow dryer or straightener in the other hand. it gives me better and faster results.</li>
    <li> Love! Would like to have this in a smaller size to get up close by hairline. Delivery was great and product was as I expected.</li>
    <li> I use to as a pass through when I am flat ironing my hair. When I use it my hair gets really straight. I do feel it puts your hair so you got to be careful.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It gets my hair super straight! Must buy! Sometimes its hair to brush and straighten at the same time but it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> It does sort of pull your hair out but it&#x27;s not painful. Lightweight and easy to use. I like it</li>
    <li> It as expected, has been working great for hair straightening, has not broken like my past brushes, love the color</li>
    <li> Was just what I wanted. helps when drying your hair w/out using a straightner&lt;br /&gt;I had one years ago but could not longer find it in stores</li>
    <li> Apparently, not effective at all for my fine, thin hair.  It did not leave impart a smooth finish AT ALL.  I ended up tossing the hair straigthener in the trash (feel kind of guilty adding to the landfill, but . . . )  Based on other reviews, it does work for some - I&#x27;m just not one of them.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use, pulls hair. My hair is very fine . Flat iron is much more gentle on my hair than this brush. Disappointed</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this brush since it&#x27;s so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pull her hair out.  She was using one of those combs that holds the hair while you flat iron but she could hear it ripping her hair out so she decided to try the brush.  It has little vents so the air goes through while blow drying so her hair was dry in no time.  She said it makes the blow dry then flat iron process so much easier.  She&#x27;s used the brush two times and so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Works good on making my curly hair straighter. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I saw this girl use it on YouTube and I thought what the hell? So I bought it and I am very satisfied. Sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose. Get this and your winning for sure!</li>
    <li> Too hard to use with the blow dryer, it&#x27;s like you need one more hand, I have the hardest time using it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this brush. She says it leaves her hair really smooth after straightening it out.  Says it is much easier to straighten out her hair as this brush helps her get the tangles out. Recommends it.</li>
    <li> This straightener served me no purpose, cause I couldn&#x27;t use it while blow drying or flat ironing my hair cause it&#x27;s too big and cumbersome!</li>
    <li> This was not what I needed or wanted.</li>
    <li> product itself is very good, for me it takes a bit more time than a quick flat iron job.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I flat iron my hair. My hair is natural (not chemically processed), and in the past it was difficult to get my hair straight, especially the ends of my hair. I used to use the comb chase method to flat iron my hair, but I like this tool so much better. I get consistently great results with this thermal hair straightener brush! My hair always comes out smooth and straight, especially my ends which I&#x27;ve noticed is usually a problem area for a lot of naturals when it comes to blowing drying and/or flat ironing their hair.</li>
    <li> Just make sure you comb out the section of hair first. Other than that it made my hair lay hunny</li>
    <li> I use this to blow dry (tension method) my hair (Kinky 4A) and flat iron it as well. It works very well to smooth my hair evenly.</li>
    <li> It works great. I use it on my hair extensions and the results cane out beautiful. I went from having really wavy hair to bone straight within 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have very thick long hair that&#x27;s naturally very wavy but frizzy if I let it air dry. I don&#x27;t use this to blow dry, but I use it while straightening my hair with a flat iron to hold the section taut and if works extremely well. I am and to straighten my hair much faster instead of having to go over the same section multiple times.</li>
    <li> I really like this little brush. I have thick, curly/wavy, mixed hair. It has never been easy to blow out my hair so I did some research and decided to give this brush a try, thinking the double side would be like a straightener when used with a blow dryer. I was right. While it doesn&#x27;t get my hair PIN straight it does straighten it and make it soft and manageable. I would recommend this for people looking to get an easier version of a salon blow out and think that those who are better or more experienced with blowouts would have no problem using this tool.</li>
    <li> I like my mega round ceramic brush better because it leaves my hair more smooth. However, during the blow out process I sometimes I have some stray strands and then I reach for this one. I&#x27;m not sure why it doensn&#x27;t leave my hair more smooth. It&#x27;s a good design and high quality but I&#x27;m always left with a touch of freeze and fly aways.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for a long time. When my niece asked me to straighten her hair, I used it on her and she loved how soft and smooth it became. This time I bought it as a birthday gift for her. The way to get the best results is to use it on dry hair. As you brush the hair, follow immediately with your iron. In other words, use the brush and the iron simultaneously, keeping the hair taut. This works far better than an iron alone.</li>
    <li> This item does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My hair gets really straight &amp; I don&#x27;t have to keep going over it with my flatiron.</li>
    <li> I have not tried using this yet but it looks like it will do the job when required.  Try no to put any more chemicals in my hair and this will work fine when I want to straighten it with the blower.</li>
    <li> I have really puffy hair. This product does not give me the salon finished hair look, it is just a normal plain brush for my hair. I had higher expeectations.</li>
    <li> This brush only requires one pass while straightening your hair.  I love it, especially on my extensions!!! Very cool concept!!!</li>
    <li> Using the Scalpmaster has really helped cut down the time it takes to flat iron my hair- which is great because it prevents the amount of damaging heat you put into your hair and it saves you time! It takes some getting used to the first time you use it (knowing how much hair you should put into it so that it could really distribute the hair so flat iron heat is distributed right, and being able to not tug on your hair because the brissles are so tough). Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;ll be something you cannot flat iron your hair without. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This was a surprise bonus to my order of another product. and it&#x27;s been a welcome addition to my hair products. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, is the best  brush I ever purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH! GREATEST THING I&#x27;VE EVER PURCHASED. I STRAIGHTEN MY RELAXED HAIR WITH IT AND IT LOOKS AS IF I JUST RECEIVED A PERM. MY LAST PERM WAS 4 MONTHS AGO. I DO MY NIECE NATURAL HAIR WITH IT AND IT IS THE GREATEST THING EVER!!! LOVE IT IT&#x27;S A MUST BUY!!!!!</li>
    <li> this says its a hair straighner well when hair straighner comes to mind i thing a heated therml plates that heat your hair to make it straight this is definatley not what i expected</li>
    <li> I have mixed, biracial hair which means it&#x27;s kinky and thick. I used to hate straightening my hair because it would take 2 hours and usually ended with less than desired results. I looked as if I had just been electrocuted instead of having tamed, flat hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product and a flat iron set to 310 degrees. It now takes me about 30 minutes to flat iron my hair and the results are beautiful. I also like that this product allows the user to brush the hair while pulling it straight without getting burned. Major plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m worried about is if the tension is causing hair breakage. I haven&#x27;t noticed any unevenness yet, but the product does pull the hair quite taut.</li>
    <li> overall ok, just pity it cant lock.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with Scalpmaster Ceramic Thermal Hair Straightener. Very convenient and easy. Of course it does not straighten as well as iron, but much less damaged hair. I am happy and very shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for something to make straightening my long, thick, wavy hair easier--so when a friend recommended this product, I had to try it. Unfortunately, even though the idea is great--it was a bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it pulls the hair taut so you don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping it rolled around a round brush or making as many passes with a regular brush and dryer. HOWEVER...it takes a minimum of twice to THREE TIMES as long to dry your hair since you have to take SUCH little pieces AND because you have to continually stop to set the dryer down, pick up the brush, get some hair situated between the bristles, pick up the dryer, blow dry the piece (while trying to aim away from your hand which is hard)...lather, rinse, repeat. With my regular hair dryer and a flat brush (not even a round brush!) I can get my hair done in 30 minutes (5 minutes per section on 6 sections). At the 30-minute mark with this brush, I was barely 1/3 done! At that point, I switched to my regular practice and was done in (comparably) a flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine this working well if you have thinner, shorter, and/or barely wavy hair---but for those of us NOT in that category? It&#x27;s a big fail. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> Great!  Saw this in a U tube video and was amazed at how it works. Currently planning to use to help me straighten my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush because I thought it would help to straighten out my hair during the blow-drying process.  It works ok, but I had a little difficulty using it so I never used it again.</li>
    <li> I love the bristles.  They firmly grip your hair while blow drying.  I even use this on my dogs hair (who HATE to be blow dried) since it shortens my grooming time.</li>
</ol>
