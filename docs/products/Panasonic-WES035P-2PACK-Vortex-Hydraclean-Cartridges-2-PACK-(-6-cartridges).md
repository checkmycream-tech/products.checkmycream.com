    <li> Good cleaning solution for my shaver.</li>
    <li> this product keeps my Panasonic electric razor operating at peak efficiency.  I learned a little trick to extend the life of the cleaner.  I rinse my razor under the hot water before I put it in the cleaning unit. Great razor.  I have a very tough beard and this cleaner keeps me well shaven.</li>
    <li> every thing fine . I needed to paid 13 GBP import duty ...</li>
    <li> Great product at an even better price than when I last purchased them. They work great at cleaning my razor.</li>
    <li> Got them as replacement for the factory one  and it work as expected ..</li>
    <li> I have had the razor for several years now.  Still works well. The cartridges are easy to change out and the system keeps my&lt;br /&gt;razor clean, charged and ready to go.</li>
    <li> Yhey do exactly what the original pack does that comes with the system.  They are used in the same way as the original one.</li>
    <li> My husband has me order these occasionally. He really likes the Panasonic Electric Razor and the Hydraclean cartridges do a really good job keeping the equipment clean. There are 6 cartridges in the box.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the cleaning cartridges before a few years ago at a local store. Unfortunetly finding them in stock is getting more difficult. Amanzon had a competive price regarding the dual pack.</li>
    <li> Good shaver cleaner leaves the shaver clean and sanitized</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a replacement to my original from my panisonic. Now I have a clean shaver for a clean shave.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not cheap, but ya gotta have a clean razor, and these are the ones designed for my electric razor, so I use them. What&#x27;s to say?</li>
    <li> This is great product! I love it!! I&#x27;m using this product since ten years ago and my shaver is still in very good condition.</li>
    <li> They are a little pricey considering how often you need to replace them.  It seems that they want to make a lot more money on the consumables than the product itself.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition . Pleased with the value .</li>
    <li> Nothing surprising here</li>
    <li> They were exactly what my husband had been searching for.  When he couldn&#x27;t find them in any store, I told him to look at Amazon; they have almost everything.  And you did!  Thanks!  The product was exactly what he needed</li>
    <li> Product was at my door step within two days,</li>
    <li> exactly what was expected, works just like the original cartridges that came with the original shaver.  So I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I would not have bothered with this cleaning system but my most recent shaver had this feature so I got into using the cleaning treatment.  Surprise!  It makes a big difference.  Much nicer smelling shaver.  Don&#x27;t resist.  This is a good setup.</li>
    <li> If you are buying this, you know how much of a difference a fresh hydraclean makes.  This is an easy way to get this hard to find item.  I&#x27;ve looked into possibly making a &amp;#34;mix at home&amp;#34; substitute, but the ingredients are not clear and looked as expensive as the cartridges.</li>
    <li> Use this product with Panasonic cleaning device.  Easy to use with great results.  A major simplification in cleaning a Panasonic razor.</li>
    <li> Advertised as 2 but came in threes...nice...</li>
    <li> works well cleaning the panasonic shaver I have. Price was okay.</li>
    <li> They work, but only last for 6 cleanings on my arc-5 razor.  Panasonic on the phone had no explanation.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do and cleans the heads well. Always recommend of course wash the bulk out before you use this so you get the most use out of it. Also it has an odd smell to it. I personally don&#x27;t prefer the smell but it isn&#x27;t bad...just odd. Also as i said you can make it last longer if you wash the bulk out first but don&#x27;t try to milk it....it gets a horrible smell to it if you use a few times and let it sit for a couple months. I used it maybe 8 times and stopped using it for a couple months and went to use it and WHOA it reeked bad! So make sure you change it after a couple months even if you don&#x27;t use it a lot because it can fester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if your lazy and got the money and sink space it is really nice but not needed.</li>
    <li> Works well and a great bargain. This is easier then trying to find these items in a store. Easy to use too</li>
    <li> First of all my husbamd loves his shaver, howerver I when I bought this for him. I did not relize that I would have to buy eani c carttridges with it. I thought it cleaned with water, with that beng said.  T&#x27;hey work great, came quickly, and a great price. Very happy,</li>
