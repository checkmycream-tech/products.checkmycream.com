    <li> To small for the price and I don&#x27;t think it was duo to start with.  Not happy don&#x27;t think I will order afain</li>
    <li> Works well, wish I had more for the price.</li>
    <li> Used the entire bottle, keeping a strict routine in application along with other Mary Kay products. While I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin, I do like the consistency of this lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars because I&#x27;m still waiting to make sure it makes a difference.</li>

    <li> I love this product, but for the price you pay, it isn&#x27;t worth it.  That&#x27;s why I give it a 3 star rating.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.  The night and day cream lasts at least 6 months.  You&#x27;re lucky if you  get a month&#x27;s use out of this product.  I will have to find another alternative or just discontinue the use of this serum.</li>
    <li> Helps effectively repair your skin from sunlight, sweat and breakouts.</li>
    <li> A good product, delivered as promised on time and in good condition--with samples of other products!</li>
    <li> If it does for me what it did for my cousin, I will Love this stuff even more!! But I am sure it takes time, doesn&#x27;t happen in one use. But I will get back to this in the near future!</li>
    <li> Yes , thank you so much !</li>
    <li> Feels great...best product ever for smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Usually, I find this item very effective.  This time the product seemed different - smelled different and felt different.  And it wasn&#x27;t quite as effective as the last one I bought.  However, it did help my skin become more smooth and helps with the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for about two years and i like what is doing to my skin</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This firmed up my jowls a lot</li>
    <li> Please order your Mary Kay products from an independent Mary Kay consultant. These products could be old or not even authentic at all.  Please don&#x27;t play Russian roulette with your skin.  Go to www.marykay.com/ageorge</li>
    <li> love the serum and smell. Doesn&#x27;t give me pimples but not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d hope</li>
