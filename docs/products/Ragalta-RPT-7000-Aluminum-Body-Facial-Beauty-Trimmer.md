      <li>A great value for the price.</li>
      <li>I liked all of the attachments that came with this as well as the price.  </li>
      <li>This one works ok.</li>
      <li>but it would be better if it had a light</li>
      <li>My wife seems to like it , trimming her eye brows, cuts precisely , don&#x27;t know the longevity yet .</li>
      <li>Sure wasn&#x27;t worth they</li>
      <li>If it breaks after a few months I would have to buy another because it is the best type for the job.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t cut the fine hairs as close as my old one which means that I have to use it more often.  </li>
      <li>Ragalta works on nose, dosent do eyebrows, put a little oil on blade, the dezine is good, 4 stars ok.</li>
      <li>Worth</li>
      <li>These are by far better than any rotary trimmer.</li>
      <li>, I put in the right battery</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need the extras, I&#x27;d just like a well made basic product that runs strongly.</li>

      <li>It does the job better than the other types of trimers for neck lines, eyebrows, and nose hairs.</li>
      <li>Even with new battery in it</li>
      <li>Fresh out of the box and with a brand new battery, the Ragalta RPT-7000 Aluminum Body Facial Beauty Trimmer would barely even turn on, let alone cut any hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought tons better for less at the a local grocery store.</li>
      <li>Love this little facial trimmer.</li>

    <li> This product is priced well. It does the job better than the other types of trimers for neck lines, eyebrows, and nose hairs. If it breaks after a few months I would have to buy another because it is the best type for the job. It looks like if I take care of it, it will last long enough to make me feel like I got my moneys worth. I have had it for a few months and it is like new. It cuts well considering the size and small battery. It also works well for personal trimings. I did not have one until recently and I was \\&quot;lacking\\&quot; and did not know that I was. The battery is holding up well. It is very small.</li>
    <li> I only used this thing one time and it completely stopped working! What a waste of my money!</li>
    <li> Pulls hairs, razor burn, difficult to change blades. Worth it&#x27;s price, convenient pouch, cap keeps other particles from getting on blade.</li>
    <li> Sure wasn&#x27;t worth they $$ I paid for this one. It for one barely works at all. Even with new battery in it the thing, it just doesn&#x27;t want to go. I won&#x27;t be using it at all. Matter of face I&#x27;m tossing it out in the trash. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve bought tons better for less at the a local grocery store.</li>
    <li> The Ragalta RPT-7000 Aluminum Body Facial Beauty Trimmer is not  working and I only get it today, I put in the right battery and it&#x27;s still not  working. What are u guys going to do about it...</li>
    <li> Seems to run through batteries a little quickly. I don&#x27;t need the extras, I&#x27;d just like a well made basic product that runs strongly. This one works ok.</li>
    <li> Arrived Broken. Return?</li>
    <li> I have used several different units over the years, and this one barely even works at all. Fresh out of the box and with a brand new battery, the Ragalta RPT-7000 Aluminum Body Facial Beauty Trimmer would barely even turn on, let alone cut any hair. Maybe I received a faulty unit, but I will never buy from Ragalta again.</li>
    <li> Theragalta body facial trimmer is nice,it gets the job done but it would be better if it had a light</li>
    <li> These are crap !  I bought two of them and they both lasted less than a week. After you&#x27;ve used them a few times they wont turn on. Not worth sending back, just tossed them.</li>
    <li> This trimmer looked a lot like the one I had for years (different brand) but it just stop working,so I ordered this one.I used it on  my Face and neck,but all it does is pull the hair and that hurts.Will only use it until I get a new one.I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> arrived as promised and works very well</li>
    <li> This is a worthless piece of crap!  It broke within 5 minutes! Do yourself a favor and pass on this item!</li>
    <li> These are by far better than any rotary trimmer. They work well for guys and gals. I&#x27;m a guy and these trim nose and ears great!</li>
    <li> Ragalta works on nose, dosent do eyebrows, put a little oil on blade, the dezine is good, 4 stars ok.</li>
    <li> not sharp. tugs on hair.</li>
    <li> My friend used it and she said it doesn&#x27;t even have the power to cut through her eyebrow..it only cuts little bit then stop...</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a different brand of facial trimmer that quit working.  I liked all of the attachments that came with this as well as the price.  The trimmer itself isn&#x27;t the greatest.  It doesn&#x27;t feel smooth enough when using it on my face.  It feels like they&#x27;re are some tiny sharp edges which isn&#x27;t good.  It also doesn&#x27;t cut the fine hairs as close as my old one which means that I have to use it more often.  I&#x27;m not sure if this was meant to be a mens product but it&#x27;s a little too rough on a womans face.  For now it will get the job done but I&#x27;ll be looking to purchase a trimmer like the one I had before this one.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to like it , trimming her eye brows, cuts precisely , don&#x27;t know the longevity yet .</li>
    <li> Love this little facial trimmer. It is so small and compact and I use it also everyday.  A great value for the price.</li>
