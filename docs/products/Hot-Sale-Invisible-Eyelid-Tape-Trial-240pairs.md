      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>I used them and liked the effect of them.  </li>
      <li>They have good gripping power</li>
      <li>Awesome item highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>The PROS are that it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
      <li>OK product for the price.</li>
      <li>Nor do they swell up ur eye if wearing them for more then a night.</li>
      <li>Ok... you were able to see them..</li>
      <li>But I prefer this tape because it&#x27;s thinner and works better for me.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried putting on makeup with it, but it should be okay.  </li>
      <li>and I reordered 8 more..</li>
      <li>many many pairs.</li>
      <li>I just received them..and i&amp;#34;m in love..</li>
      <li>This tape is better than others that I have tried, however it does not come with the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This gel makes the tape even more invisible on the lid.  </li>
      <li>The ones that they sell at Daiso Japan are much better.</li>
      <li>The shipping was really fast, which was pleasantly surprising.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with eyelid tape, you might know that double-sided tape is much better.</li>
      <li>Anyway, these work fine.</li>
      <li>but im happy they gave me enough to try and theirs</li>
      <li>The product itself is not bad.</li>
      <li>i think they are better than double sided ones.. will buy again :)</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;ll be probably hating this one and loving the other one for more money.</li>
      <li>So easy and they really work.  </li>
      <li>and I like the texture, which is kind of like medical tape.</li>
      <li>This is a fun product to experiment</li>
      <li>totally worth the money</li>
      <li>I have to use double for one eye because they are kind of thing</li>
      <li>Good product as expected.</li>
      <li>I paid for these and right after, I had to throw ALL of them away.</li>
      <li>a long shipment wait just buy some more cheap ones till these arrive</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product but wish it was little wider.</li>
      <li>Thanks a bunch!</li>
      <li>both my eye lids don&#x27;t exactly match.</li>
      <li>You also get many of the tapes, so they can last you a while.</li>
      <li>Works well, pretty sticky.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not the invisible type, easily noticeable when wear, but i only use it when i have puffy eyelids (allergy / inflammation)</li>
      <li>BUT I still love them and use them every single day</li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I just peel it off and it stays the whole day</li>
      <li>It takes awhile to get them placed exactly so, but once you get it down it is smooth sailing.</li>
      <li>WOW WOW WOW</li>
      <li>think you really need to cover them with a dark shadow, because they are obvious if you don&#x27;t tuck them in the right place on your eyelid.</li>
      <li>It only last 2-3 hours and not the whole day.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve become majorly spoiled by Amazon Prime.</li>
      <li>Wow not double sided......</li>

<li> Wow not double sided......</li>
<li> Unless you have super thin skin around your eyes, it won&#x27;t work at all.</li>
<li> (free shipping and the price, you cant go wrong.)</li>
<li> I give it one stas because it arrived earlier than expected, but other than that I am sooooo disapointed, it is not double sided so there is NO way to lift the eyelid</li>
<li> so I might change my mind later when I get this down.</li>
<li> I only put them on for a few hours and my eye lids will stay in place for the rest of the day, or for days.  </li>
<li> wider than expected.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t as expected.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s not very ideal for everyday wear (as it doesn&#x27;t last too long on your eyelids).  </li>
<li> It is a lot less noticeable, and it&#x27;s also easier to use (in my opinion.).</li>
<li> less time than having to do your makeup all the time.</li>
<li> However you do have to reapply every 4 hours or so, because the sweat on your eyelids will make this tape become less sticky and therefore fall off.</li>
<li> I wear it everyday with no irritation and it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
<li> Even though its a little thin and doesn&#x27;t stick as well as other eyelid tapes</li>
<li> , then I repeat the process over and over everyday, sometimes even if I don&#x27;t put it on, it stays for at least another day</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> At least they should come with instructions.</li>
<li> too thin, skin rolls over it</li>
<li> Extremely thin and doesn&#x27;t have any sort of a grip</li>
<li> It was too thin.</li>
<li> All in all, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product.</li>
<li> And every time I blinked, you could&#x27;ve seen the tape, horrible!</li>
<li> and it was $12 something, it terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So easy and they really work.  My friends want me to give them some of mine now.</li>
    <li> It came 10 days before it said it was going to come. It&#x27;s invisible and it looks great with makeup too.</li>
    <li> Ehhh. Doesnr stick.on good</li>
    <li> I give it one stas because it arrived earlier than expected, but other than that I am sooooo disapointed, it is not double sided so there is NO way to lift the eyelid :/ I put them and they lasted mmm 2 minutes? And every time I blinked, you could&#x27;ve seen the tape, horrible! At least they should come with instructions. Anyway... Don&#x27;t try to save money buying this trash. This is a rip off.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I ordered another similar to this and it was $12 something, it terrible. This one works great, and you cannot see it. I thought I&#x27;ll be probably hating this one and loving the other one for more money. But it&#x27;s comple the opposite.</li>
    <li> Definitely invisible if you apply it on nude eyelid. Works well, pretty sticky. But it irritates my skin a bit, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a 3.</li>
    <li> Give it a try! I only use these when I wake up and both my eye lids don&#x27;t exactly match. I only put them on for a few hours and my eye lids will stay in place for the rest of the day, or for days.  (free shipping and the price, you cant go wrong.)</li>
    <li> The shipping was really fast, which was pleasantly surprising. The product itself is not bad. The tape isn&#x27;t too noticeable. However you do have to reapply every 4 hours or so, because the sweat on your eyelids will make this tape become less sticky and therefore fall off. I haven&#x27;t tried putting on makeup with it, but it should be okay.  The PROS are that it&#x27;s very cheap. You also get many of the tapes, so they can last you a while. This is a fun product to experiment different looks with. But it&#x27;s not very ideal for everyday wear (as it doesn&#x27;t last too long on your eyelids).  The CONS are that it&#x27;s not double-sided tape. If you&#x27;re familiar with eyelid tape, you might know that double-sided tape is much better. It is a lot less noticeable, and it&#x27;s also easier to use (in my opinion.). This wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem if it was specified. But I had no way of knowing whether it was single-sided or double-sided. Because it was not noted in the description. Another con is that there are no instructions that come with this. Now, thankfully I knew how to use this stuff, but this may be a problem for people who don&#x27;t know. Then I would recommend to check out some videos, such as Michelle Phan&#x27;s &amp;#34;How to Even Your Eyelids Out Without Surgery&amp;#34;.  All in all, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product. But I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works great and fantastic price!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, this product is great. Even though its a little thin and doesn&#x27;t stick as well as other eyelid tapes it still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy this. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but according to the last experience, I like this product.</li>
    <li> Works great practically invisible can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s there to give me my baby doll look I have when I put them on. Nor do they swell up ur eye if wearing them for more then a night. Awesome item highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Best one that I&#x27;ve found yet. Unnoticeable and the price is awesome for 240 pairs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but wish it was little wider. Too skinny.</li>
    <li> This tape is better than others that I have tried, however it does not come with the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; that &amp;#34;Eye Magic&amp;#34; tapes use.  This gel makes the tape even more invisible on the lid.  But I prefer this tape because it&#x27;s thinner and works better for me.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as expected.</li>
    <li> too thin, skin rolls over it</li>
    <li> I love these! I have to use double for one eye because they are kind of thing BUT I still love them and use them every single day</li>
    <li> How do you use these. Wow not double sided......</li>
    <li> It takes awhile to get them placed exactly so, but once you get it down it is smooth sailing.</li>
    <li> totally worth the money</li>
    <li> Love it! The problem is. . It only last 2-3 hours and not the whole day.</li>
    <li> Would have given it a &amp;#34;5 star&amp;#34;, but there were no instructions.  I used them and liked the effect of them.  Cannot not be seen whether you put on prior to or after adding makeup.</li>
    <li> Truly I don&#x27;t know why people are complaining about this item. I&#x27;ve ordered the product numerous of times and I formed a permanent eyelid. I wear it everyday with no irritation and it&#x27;s not noticeable. No eyelid sugary here! Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> It took months to receive and there is only adhesive on ONE SIDE!....NO INSTRUCTIONS !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this</li>
    <li> These are awesome, it is kinda visible when you put them on and I don&#x27;t have any concealer or anything so what I do is I put them on 3 or 4 hours before I sleep and I leave it on over night (I only put it on, on one eye because I was born with a mono lid and a double lid) when I wake up I do my daily routine WITHOUT peeling it off then when it&#x27;s time for me to do my eye makeup I just peel it off and it stays the whole day, then I repeat the process over and over everyday, sometimes even if I don&#x27;t put it on, it stays for at least another day</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it. Extremely thin and doesn&#x27;t have any sort of a grip and so doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin.</li>
    <li> i still dont know how to use these but im happy they gave me enough to try and theirs a long shipment wait just buy some more cheap ones till these arrive</li>
    <li> It is not double sided sticky, so it would not stay on my eyelid after 1 hour.</li>
    <li> I just received them..and i&amp;#34;m in love..you definitely cannot see them with or without makeup..I bought 4 packs..and I reordered 8 more..AMAZING..you definitely need to try this brand..I was using scotch tape witch worked Ok... you were able to see them..these, you cannot..WOW WOW WOW</li>
    <li> I need to use two of them for each eye each time.  OK product for the price.</li>
    <li> These took awhile to arrive, but not an unreasonable amount of time. I think I&#x27;ve become majorly spoiled by Amazon Prime. Anyway, these work fine. They have good gripping power and I like the texture, which is kind of like medical tape. I&#x27;m still practicing using them, so it&#x27;s a good thing there are so many of them in the packet! It&#x27;s a good price for the amount you get. I think I&#x27;ve almost got the technique down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you really need to cover them with a dark shadow, because they are obvious if you don&#x27;t tuck them in the right place on your eyelid. As I said, I&#x27;m still practicing with these, so I might change my mind later when I get this down.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given it a 0 star if that was possible! It was too thin. Unless you have super thin skin around your eyes, it won&#x27;t work at all. I paid for these and right after, I had to throw ALL of them away. The ones that they sell at Daiso Japan are much better.</li>
    <li> They fit my eye perfect</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this because it&#x27;s with one side tape, which cannot paste natually</li>
    <li> - Very good price&lt;br /&gt;- Package came on time, about a week coz sent from China i believe, in a small (5&amp;#34;x5&amp;#34;) paper bag.&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s not the invisible type, easily noticeable when wear, but i only use it when i have puffy eyelids (allergy / inflammation)</li>
    <li> Good product as expected. Very easy to use. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> wider than expected.GOOD!  they WORK! fast shipping. many many pairs. you will need to reapply after 10 hours. less time than having to do your makeup all the time. works for me!</li>
    <li> I love them! they work and they are not noticeable! i think they are better than double sided ones.. will buy again :)</li>
