      <li>Skin feels great with no weird smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not afraid of people touching my skin anymore, which is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>and I have been using this body scrub for more than 3 years and never moved to another product.</li>
      <li>most of my breakouts are gone and I can wear sleeveless tops</li>
      <li>This worked okay, but wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Very soothing and feels great.</li>
      <li>Even though I did not buy this product from Amazon (because it was on sale at my local store), I needed to write this review because Neutrogena Products are simply AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>Very very happy with the purchase and definitely recommend it</li>
      <li>the most part it seems to have cleared up my skin though.</li>
      <li>Love its smell.</li>
      <li>I love the way that the exfoliators feel.</li>
      <li>Nice little scrubbing beads, and great texture!</li>
      <li>then I rinse it off and I feel quite clean after!  </li>
      <li>It really does work wonderfully, getting rid of body acne and giving you clear skin</li>
      <li>Okay, nothing special.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything that a cheap body wash from the drugstore wouldn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>So when I sweat and break out with temples using this once or twice cleaned up my acne significantly.</li>
      <li>but then noticed that it mainly affected my prominent hand without spreading, which meant it was something that I used primarily with it.</li>
      <li>It smells good and totally helped with my acne.</li>
      <li>However, the perfume is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this product and would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>I have only been using it for about 3-4 days, I will update in a month with more information, though!</li>
      <li>It is amazing that after fighting the breakouts on my arms and legs for more than 4 years, this scrub is improving my skin in less than a week.</li>
      <li>This leaves a very clean scent and leave your skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Totally satisfied with Neutrogena Body Clear Scrub.</li>
      <li>The small is great, and this wash won&#x27;t leave any residue on your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always amazed when Neutrogena, a company that claims to make products for sensitive skin, uses strong perfumes.</li>
      <li>Received this as a gift and the first time I tried to use it in the shower the scrub would not come out of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>so we&#x27;re pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone who has body acne.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different products before.</li>
      <li>It does not irritate my skin and the has a nice consistency, however, the scent isn&#x27;t what I expected and smells perfumey rather than citrusy to me.  </li>
      <li>I love this scrub with my new back scrubber and gloves.</li>
      <li>Helped clear up my skin so fast!!</li>
      <li>He said that it really cleans his skin.</li>
      <li>Not much to say, but it is ok.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to want to smooth on, I had to work it in my hands with water before I could properly apply it.  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper at walmart.</li>
      <li>and I felt like I was throwing away money on something that didn&#x27;t really help with body acne.</li>
      <li>hope this review helps someone out there, because I know this scrub has really made a difference in the way my skin is looking.</li>
      <li>i dont know if thats good or bad, but i personally like to smell really good after a shower.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m only able to lay on my back.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I typically use more natural products for this reason but wanted to try this.</li>
      <li>I tried to use this product several times with the same problem but also I did not feel smooth at all after using it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with body acne, but I do get breakouts every once in a while, adn I find that this product works really well to tame those breakouts.</li>
      <li>It also shipped sooner than expected which is always a positive thing!!</li>
      <li>My go to for clear skin!</li>
      <li>I have no idea where it came from, but I have never had an issue with acne until now (and I am 25 years old!).</li>
      <li>This is the only one that has worked for me with mild back acne.</li>
      <li>The little beads feel really good and not too harsh.</li>
      <li>and wow, what a difference.</li>
      <li>So far, it seems to be working.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I felt pretty dry, gave up and threw it away.</li>
      <li>I use it with an exfoliating brush, and the skin of my back is new.</li>
      <li>and it doesnt really smell good or bad.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but good enough</li>
      <li>This make a tremendous lather with very little soap and has scrubbing granules in it for exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I was not impressed with the smell, it was very soapy and strong.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize what it was at first, started with little spots between my fingers and sides of palms.</li>
      <li>No new breakouts so far.</li>
      <li>Next time I will buy a less expensive brand, which is just as good</li>
      <li>It worked a little bit, not too much.</li>

<li> and now I just started using this body scrub twice a day for the stubborn, odd looking breakouts I get on my upper arms and upper legs (some sort of orange peel skin / tiny little acne breakouts) and after less than a week; I have DEFINITELY seen about an 80% improvement in the softness and beauty of my skin ...</li>
<li> It leaves you feeling very clean, and it&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> my only problems are that its ridiculously hard to squeeze out of the bottle</li>
<li> I was very insecure about the moderate acne I started getting with my pregnancy, a quarter way through the bottle, my skin is clear again.</li>
<li> The scrub is very thick and a little hard to put on.  </li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> It was a little expensive but it works</li>
<li> I had a bad break out on my back</li>
<li> I was exhausted.  </li>
<li> So disappointing.</li>

    <li> My son wanted it as a gift  He said that it really cleans his skin.</li>
    <li> I have body acne and I have been using this body scrub for more than 3 years and never moved to another product. Totally satisfied with Neutrogena Body Clear Scrub. Love its smell.</li>
    <li> Has a pleasant smell. Feels good on skin. Be careful on face for sensitive skin - exfoliator beads can be harsh in that area.</li>
    <li> it does what its supposed to do. it gets rid of acne. my only problems are that its ridiculously hard to squeeze out of the bottle and it doesnt really smell good or bad. its like squeezing out syrup thats been in the freezer for an hour. and when ur done taking a shower...u have no scent. i dont know if thats good or bad, but i personally like to smell really good after a shower.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time and seems to be working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent.  I put it on with my long scrubby thing and let it sit a bit then I rinse it off and I feel quite clean after!  I like it</li>
    <li> Love it! Skin feels great with no weird smell.</li>
    <li> The scrub is very thick and a little hard to put on.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to want to smooth on, I had to work it in my hands with water before I could properly apply it.  The little beads feel really good and not too harsh. Skin felt smoother after using, although it did seem drying. I was not impressed with the smell, it was very soapy and strong. Thankfully it faded after rinsing!</li>
    <li> Very soothing and feels great.</li>
    <li> My sister and I both tend to get acne on our chest and back and when we used this Neutrogena Body Clear Body Scrub, within a few uses we could notice a very obvious difference in our skin!  It really does work wonderfully, getting rid of body acne and giving you clear skin so we&#x27;re pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone who has body acne.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with body acne, but I do get breakouts every once in a while, adn I find that this product works really well to tame those breakouts. I love the way that the exfoliators feel. The small is great, and this wash won&#x27;t leave any residue on your skin. I have not found it too drying, either. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product works really really good. I had a bad break out on my back him I&#x27;m bedbound and I&#x27;m only able to lay on my back. So when I sweat and break out with temples using this once or twice cleaned up my acne significantly. Very very happy with the purchase and definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a week or so so I can&#x27;t say how effective it is.  It does not irritate my skin and the has a nice consistency, however, the scent isn&#x27;t what I expected and smells perfumey rather than citrusy to me.  I typically use more natural products for this reason but wanted to try this.</li>
    <li> Even though I did not buy this product from Amazon (because it was on sale at my local store), I needed to write this review because Neutrogena Products are simply AMAZING!!! I have used the hair line, face cleansing line, make-up removal line, acne therapy line and now I just started using this body scrub twice a day for the stubborn, odd looking breakouts I get on my upper arms and upper legs (some sort of orange peel skin / tiny little acne breakouts) and after less than a week; I have DEFINITELY seen about an 80% improvement in the softness and beauty of my skin ... most of my breakouts are gone and I can wear sleeveless tops again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to any one fighting orange peel skin / acne breakouts and if I could give it more than 5 stars, I will give it a 100!!! It is amazing that after fighting the breakouts on my arms and legs for more than 4 years, this scrub is improving my skin in less than a week. Something that I must mention though, because I read about some people having allergic reactions to this scrub, is that I am a Latina who moved to this country 4 years ago, and that&#x27;s when my skin started breakingout. When I visited my dermatologist, she said that my skin was reacting to the change from one tropical setting to the 4 seasons of this country and she advised me to use NEUTROGENA PRODUCTS to have a healthy skin!! I have been a believer ever since!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps someone out there, because I know this scrub has really made a difference in the way my skin is looking. I wish I would have thought about using it 4 years ago!!!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product and would definitely buy again. It also shipped sooner than expected which is always a positive thing!!</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift and the first time I tried to use it in the shower the scrub would not come out of the bottle.  By the time I did manage to get some out I was exhausted.  I tried to use this product several times with the same problem but also I did not feel smooth at all after using it.  I felt pretty dry, gave up and threw it away. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Not much to say, but it is ok. It worked a little bit, not too much. But it did help so it gets 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Helps control body acne. Good product.</li>
    <li> This make a tremendous lather with very little soap and has scrubbing granules in it for exfoliation. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome, works great/ It was a little expensive but it works</li>
    <li> Okay, nothing special.  Next time I will buy a less expensive brand, which is just as good</li>
    <li> My go to for clear skin!</li>
    <li> Much cheaper at walmart. This worked okay, but wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It didn&#x27;t do anything that a cheap body wash from the drugstore wouldn&#x27;t and I felt like I was throwing away money on something that didn&#x27;t really help with body acne. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, but would use if I had it.</li>
    <li> This soap is really good! It smells good and totally helped with my acne. I use it with an exfoliating brush, and the skin of my back is new. Seriously.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything, and it make my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;So I recommand you guys to just apply it on your acne affected area.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub with my new back scrubber and gloves. However, the perfume is pretty strong. I&#x27;m always amazed when Neutrogena, a company that claims to make products for sensitive skin, uses strong perfumes. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> This leaves a very clean scent and leave your skin very soft. No new breakouts so far. I don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This works to help exfoliate your skin but don&#x27;t use too often or you&#x27;ll get dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> It leaves you feeling very clean, and it&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t bad. There was no &#x27;Ooooooo, that smells good&#x27; when I used it. But like I said, it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part it seems to have cleared up my skin though. It&#x27;s not perfect, but good enough</li>
    <li> I got this because of recent back acne. I have no idea where it came from, but I have never had an issue with acne until now (and I am 25 years old!). So far, it seems to be working. I have only been using it for about 3-4 days, I will update in a month with more information, though!</li>
    <li> Nice little scrubbing beads, and great texture!</li>
    <li> I am not sure what exactly is in this scrub, but I got contact dermatitis all over my hands from using it. I didn&#x27;t realize what it was at first, started with little spots between my fingers and sides of palms. I even thought it might be scabies (AHHH!), but then noticed that it mainly affected my prominent hand without spreading, which meant it was something that I used primarily with it. After 3 weeks of trial and error, it turned out to be this scrub from lathering with it. I would be careful if you are sensitive.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my husband back acne. Very good and affordable!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that fights my bacne and my bumpy &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;. I use a brush in the shower with this and wow, what a difference. I&#x27;m not afraid of people touching my skin anymore, which is pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other body scrub product, makes me soft and clears up my back and chest.</li>
    <li> Helped clear up my skin so fast!! I was very insecure about the moderate acne I started getting with my pregnancy, a quarter way through the bottle, my skin is clear again. Hallelujah!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products before. This is the only one that has worked for me with mild back acne. It worked immediately too. Within a couple of days it cleared up my back and I have had no acne since!!</li>
