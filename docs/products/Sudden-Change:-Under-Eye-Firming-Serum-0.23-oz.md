<li> A complete waste of money---did absolutely NOTHING</li>
<li> This did suddenly change my under eye bags, and it tightned the wrinkles around my eyes, trouble was, as soon as I showed any kind of emotion the wrinkles were actually worse than the ones this product was supposed to combat!</li>
<li> LET IT DRY</li>
<li> LET DRY DONE TAKES A LITTLE PRACTICE</li>
<li> Makes skin feel dry and as if it has dried glue on it.</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles.  </li>
<li> Minimal change lasts a few hours.</li>
<li> SPARINGLY TAKE A LITTLE ON YOUR FINGER</li>
<li> Dark circles remained after a week of use, no better than my cover up method.</li>
<li> PRETTY BAD PUFFINESS PROBABLY WILL NEED SURGERY</li>
<li> Not sure what to expect.</li>
<li> MAYBE ILL TRY IT NEXT</li>
<li> It gave results, but they only lasted an hour.....very disappointed.  </li>
<li> That was a little disappointing.</li>
<li> It was not 100%, but then I have very bad puffs under my eyes.</li>
