<li> We use them several times before throwing away because they are far stronger than the lame ones sold in the grocery store.  </li>
<li> Some of the roto points did not have point they were round on the ends.</li>
<li> like these, I think they are too expensive now.  </li>
<li> We used to get them from our dentist who ran out and started giving silly toothbrushes instead.  </li>

    <li> Throw the dental floss away.  Carry one in your pocket and you can &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; anywhere, directly after eating.  Best product of it&#x27;s type on the market, and most recommended by my dentist - based on the condition of my teeth at cleanings.  Reusable for several times too.</li>
    <li> best teeth cleaning product!</li>
    <li> Easy reading love these books short and sweet need more book like this one . thanks for the good book</li>
    <li> I have been in the dental field for many years &amp; have used the Rotadent Pics for about 10 years.  They work wonderfully because they are tapered to fit between your teeth &amp; they bend to get into crowded spaces.  I love these &amp; would recommend these to anyone looking to keep the area between their teeth clean when not able to floss.  These are great for when you eat out &amp; can&#x27;t floss.</li>
    <li> These work great. Nice and sturdy but thin and pointed. Gets in between the teeth perfectly.</li>
    <li> My dentist advised against using sharp items to clean teeth due to possible damage to the gums, however I use these on a continuing basis for I have found that if you are careful they do an excellent job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Rotadent Cleaners for about 15 years, and yes, they are GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;When my dentist retired years ago, I bought a supply from the company through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They sent me about 25 boxes -- this supply lasted me about 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;The last order provided only about 5 -- and most of them are now gone.  Much as I&lt;br /&gt;really like these, I think they are too expensive now.  I&#x27;ll look for an alternative&lt;br /&gt;...and I hope the Rotadent people are reading this...</li>
    <li> These are by far the best toothpicks I have ever found.  They last a long time, I carry one with me all the time.</li>
    <li> We first started using these years ago when our dentist recommended them for my husband&#x27;s receding gums. They work so well that after steady use for several months, the dentist told my husband his gums were so much better that he would be able to avoid gum surgery. We&#x27;ve used them ever since. This supplier offers a very good price.</li>
    <li> I use these in place of flossing.  Easier to use, less pain, and have great results.  Keep them in my car and use during my commute.</li>
    <li> Throw the toothpicks away. These are worth their weight in gold! Great!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpick around. My sister&#x27;s dentist recommended them to her and I found them here. Great buy....you&#x27;ll love them!</li>
    <li> These Roto Point toothpicks are greeat, have used them for many years.  First time I thought to search onlline for them though.

Although I ordered the 5 box pack, one box can last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used these for 10 years maybe, they are great. They do not take the place of flossing, they work to get food stuck from between your teeth.</li>
    <li> work more easily than floss on my dental problems and in my situation.  really miss them when not around  one more word required</li>
    <li> Gets in between teeth as well as floss does</li>
    <li> I use these daily instead of flossing.  My dentist approves.</li>
    <li> The design of these is perfect.  The triangular shape works to perfectly fill the void at the gum line.  Next best thing to floss, by far.  Plus, these are definitely reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer will be glad to hear that I buy these by the handful and give them out to my friends :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I have a built in retainer that traps everything. These are bendable and get into the nooks and crannies. Also they massage the gums and my hygienist is always happy, they never bleed. I have them in every purse, car, everywhere. I&#x27;d be lost without them.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist gave me a pack of these years ago, and they are a Godsend. They help prevent food pockets and keep the gums firm and healthy. Must haves. Insert between teeth 3-4 times after brushing.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to these picks by a Dentist and I loved the way they cleaned my teeth.  After I used up the box he had given me, I typed a search into Amazon and was happy to find them for sale here.  That Dentist has retired and I didn&#x27;t think I would find them anywhere.  I got them for a good price and have been using them again so I&#x27;m very happy with this product and the seller too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that is hard to find.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years.</li>
    <li> I really like these things for getting food out of the gaps of my teeth.  I&#x27;m older, and, with gums receding, I keep these in my purse to help me out after I eat somewhere.</li>
    <li> My husband use to get these from his dentist and they stopped giving them. This is the only place I have found them, and he is thrilled.</li>
    <li> Some of the roto points did not have point they were round on the ends.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for. Dentist no longer carries these. Shipping fast.</li>
    <li> These are the best toothpicks I have ever used. Rinse them after use and one will last for months. This 5 single pack order should last one person 10 to 20 years - barring losing them frequently.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a hygienist.  They work very well for my teeth which are spaced very tight and hard to get floss between.</li>
    <li> Have used these for 15 years, can&#x27;t buy anything better</li>
    <li> Has prolonged my gum life for years.</li>
    <li> These are simply the best &amp;#34;pickers&amp;#34;.  We used to get them from our dentist who ran out and started giving silly toothbrushes instead.  These were WAY better.  And this order came with enough to last us for the next couple of years.  We use them several times before throwing away because they are far stronger than the lame ones sold in the grocery store.  If you are a devoted picker because you can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t floss like me, these are the ones for you.</li>
    <li> I got these roto points from a dentist 20 yrs. ago.  I loved them and never could find them again. So I was elated that they have them here.  I have several crowns and spaces and wood cheap toothpicks get stuck, don&#x27;t work, or even break BETWEEN my teeth. (Try getting that out!) Even dental floss would sometimes get stuck in between the teeth.  These do NOT!  I love them.  I keep one in my car, on my night stand, purse, by my computer, always one close!  Happy I found them again!</li>
    <li> Better than toothpicks....good for teeth and gums.  Glad we were able to find on Amazon....had gotten first pak from dentist</li>
    <li> Have been trying to find these. Arrived really fast and exactly as advertised.</li>
