<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> seems to work as designed</li>
    <li> Great will order more. Could come with extra blades would help?</li>
    <li> Love this! Great design and works well.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package, the blade fell out and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get it back together.  I have not even been able to try this product out to see if it really does work or not!</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of this type of product and Bought because of the big tweezerman name. surprised to find no instructions...cut my fingers twice..dont know how to use it:(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the way I used it or what but this thing fell apart after I used it once, on one foot! I&#x27;ll stick to the professionals at my nail salon lol.</li>
    <li> I have a Master&#x27;s degree so I know I&#x27;m not stupid, but the blade falls off and does not stay on and for the life of me I cannot figure out how this item is supposed to work.  So far this is the most frustrating item I have ever bought from Amazon!</li>
    <li> really feeble, didnt make me feel safe to use it. I ended up just getting a scrub/buffer from bath body works. the cyan blue one.</li>
    <li> It works and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This rusted within 2 or 3 uses despite having dried it off each time.</li>
    <li> December 16, 2010: What I said below still applies. However, a little practice, the discovery of \\&quot;pulling up\\&quot; slightly while slicing, and knowing when enough is enough makes this the best tool that I&#x27;ve used for callous removal in 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had trouble with my feet and shoes for years and years. I used to get blisters. Now I get callouses and, as anyone with deep callouses at the ball of the foot will tell you, they kill! Try walking with a pebble in each shoe and then add one to the little toe just in case you&#x27;re a sadomasochist. That&#x27;s what my lousy feet have been like, and this from a guy who played racquetball. squash, and tennis for over 45 years! (Throw in 5 years of marching including \\&quot;extra duty\\&quot; for those who know the old military.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the doctors I don&#x27;t mind going to, the podiatrist is the one that I mind the least. You come out feeling better than when you went in. But who wants to do that on a weekly or bi-weekly (or is it semi-weekly?) basis. That&#x27;s how quickly my callouses recur. This Tweezerman Safety Glide with rasp is the best tool I&#x27;ve found. The fact that it&#x27;s a combo and that the rasp when exposed covers the blade makes it a great tool, and for under 10 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rasp is almost as good as what my mom used to use. Her&#x27;s was a 3\\&quot; oval and remained sharp or I should say remains sharp to this day. Still, having one tool for cutting and one for smoothing is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to disagree with those who say to do this when your feet or callouses are moist. I found that the blade binds because the skin around the callous IS moist. Best to have the blade glide over the raised callous bit by bit than to get caught at the base of the callous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, nothing will ever make my feet smooth, and I don&#x27;t really care. At my age, my feet get less exposure than my knees or double chin or anything else I no longer care to hide. (Besides, it&#x27;s winter and Levis are the order of the day. That covers my knees. If I live to be 100, my belt will ride so high that my chin may well be covered, too - just like I used to see in Miami Beach. SO, one last tip. If you want your feet smooth so that your socks glide on over your feet, use a podiatrists \\&quot;wax\\&quot; daily. There&#x27;s also one put out by Johnson and Johnson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now this review is getting a little squirrely. I just hope that there are men who understand and perhaps empathize with my foot problems. Callouses are not just for women. We get &#x27;em, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since, I&#x27;m about to erase my previous review, I&#x27;ll reiterate what I said the first time. This uses a razor blade. Treat it as such. Don&#x27;t cut too deep. Take your time, especially when doing the opposite foot, i.e. the one ON your dominant side (right foot for right handed people etc.). Do this in as much light as you can get on the bottom of your foot; not always easy especially when your - my - stomach casts a shadow. Leave a little callous because, if they&#x27;re below skin level, in a weird way, they actually cushion the bone ... for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad had perfect feet. I inherited his nose and ears and sense of humor. Thanks, Dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom had perfect skin and beautiful eyes. I inherited her feet. But I also got her Tweezerman rasp.

    <li> I was hesitant to get this b/c I was afraid it would hurt.  But it&#x27;s super easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, and very effective.  It does take a couple tries to figure it out, though - long, light sweeps work better than going slow and deep.  It&#x27;s also a really great price.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used to occasionally use a regular safety razor for this, which works too, but I always figured it would dull the blade for actual shaving.  This tool is great because it&#x27;s much easier to clean than a safety razor, having been designed for the purpose.    Sometimes I soak my feet for a while first and sometimes I just use it in the shower; the former is a bit more effective and a bit more work.    I&#x27;d have given it five stars but the blade does get rusty much faster than a safety razor does.  It&#x27;s mostly just discoloration though; I find I can still use a blade for a little while after it starts to turn orange with no ill effect.    I&#x27;ve never used the rasp tool.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping your hands smooth!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for my feet. I bought it for my hands. I&#x27;m also a man. And I&#x27;ve got manly hands, that I need to keep from getting too grizzly. And this things helps with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re doing weight lifting, or doing higher intensity interval training such as CrossFit, your hands are most likely getting some good calluses due to barbells, dumbbells, pull-ups, etc. The thicker your calluses get, the more likely they are to rip open during your workout. This Tweezerman Callus Shaver helps keep those calluses from getting too bulky. As long as you can figure out how to use it after it arrives...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the heck do you use this things? I opened the package and tried to give it a go, but there were no directions on usage. After viewing a video online, I finally realized: You NEED to REMOVE (pop off) the little white piece from the blade side, in order to be able to reveal the blade. Make sure the blade is also pushed up all the way. You&#x27;ll then see a little crevice between the metal and the blade. This is where your skin will get under the blade and shave off. The white plastic piece covers this area for safety when not in use. With the white piece off, if you slide the blade DOWN, it will remove the blade for replacement (or you can also rotate it, as there are two sides to the razor...and only one side is used at a time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving of the hands works pretty well with this, especially if your calluses are built up pretty well. But some times you do need to apply a bit of pressure and maneuver the device. Or do another couple passes after using the rasp. Trimming a few of the skin fold areas in the middle of the hand/palm can be a bit difficult, but still manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rasp side is also useful, and you&#x27;ll be surprised how much dry skin you end up flaking off (into the device)...even if it looks like it&#x27;s just roughing up your hands. It&#x27;s not as cheese-grater like as I expected, but it still seems to work. It will basically work like a rough grit sand paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing does work great, and definitely it a must have at this price...especially if you don&#x27;t want to skip a workout due to destroyed hands. Just because you have calluses doesn&#x27;t mean your hands are tough. Sure, they probably won&#x27;t blister now, but they can still rip open if you don&#x27;t keep your calluses under control. Sure you could also wear gloves, but you really shouldn&#x27;t have to resort to that, expect for really high-rep workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this thing. Use it weekly.work like a rough grit sand paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing does work great, and definitely it a must have at this price...especially if you don&#x27;t want to skip a workout due to destroyed hands.

    <li> This is amazing. Nothing fancy just a razor blade to your calloused feet but it is so great. I have feet that resemble normal human feet after years of wearing flats with no socks. I used to have deep heel cracks and was super ashamed to show anyone. Truly miraculous.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high hopes. With the way that they described it in the description, I thought that the blade would indefinitely save my rough, calloused heels from the then current state of them. Unfortunately, the blade was dull and poorly fastened in the shaver itself. After one swipe, it grazed over the dead skin and hardly skinned a layer off. Never purchasing again. I&#x27;ve found better lotions/treatments for less.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. I have been fighting callouses for over 20 years. I finally won. Works best for me with dry feet. I bought another with extra blades; never want to be without. By-the-way, after hundreds of dollars, I found that the best moisturizer is Vaseline Petroleum Jelly Deep Moisture Creamy Formula. Amazon has it.</li>
    <li> It does what it says and its better than most because it wont let your shave off more skin than is safe.&lt;br /&gt;I was a but heavy handed my first time &amp; now the skin on my heel is tender, but its smooth &amp; I did not \\&quot;cut\\&quot; myself.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll not scrape with the peeler so long.</li>
    <li> This product works great, but I think it&#x27;s only good for extremely callused feet. My feet got all raw after using this because it&#x27;s just a blade cutting of your skin. I prefer the Ped Egg, but this probably works wonders for very bad calluses.</li>
    <li> this actually works great!!</li>
    <li> Maybe I am using this wrong but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on me. I also don&#x27;t have too much skin to remove, maybe someone with a lot of extra dry skin would benefit from the better.</li>
    <li> The blade is dull and tough to actually use. I know they&#x27;re trying to be safe but they definitely compromised functionality. Also, the \\&quot;file\\&quot; was not effective at all. I might ask well have been trying to tickle my foot.</li>
    <li> One of the few things that really works on foot callouses.  I felt really dumb though until I took the guard off.  No mention of that anywhere!!</li>
    <li> Works well. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic. When I first opened it and got it out I manage to dislodged the blade lock and holding assembly. Then I was a bit afraid and somewhat angry and rather disappointed. I took a breif pause and then carefully picked up the peices from where I had left off. By then it was time to reassemble the whole thing back to use again. After a little tinkering and toiling things started to happen. The blade was locked in place and I began to apply the tool to the bottoms and heels of my feet. And as I did that the years, memories, and layers upon layers of dead skin started to peel away from the bottoms and heels of my feet. This is great. And I myself and my feet feel great. \\&quot;Give it a try!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The blade, if it comes out, is extremely hard to get back in. Other than that, I am happy with it</li>
    <li> It is a bit scary to use, but works extremely well.  Shipper got it out quite quickly, too.</li>
    <li> OMG WHAT A PEIECE OF GARBAGE. AFTER 2 DAYS THE BLADE WENT BLACK WITH RUST FROM THE STEAM IN THE BATHROOM. ITS OBVIOUSLY NOT MAD EFROM A DECENT METAL THAT WOULD NOT RUST SO EASY. I AM GOING SHOPPING FOR SOMETHING BETTER.</li>
    <li> Great product but be careful.  I have taken a hunk out of my foot on more than one occassion</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND IT SEEMS TO DO THE JOB WELL. NO CUTS AS OF YET.</li>
    <li> I live in LA and LIVE in sandals or open heels.  My right foot had a deep and painful cracked heel.  After using the pedi egg religiously, and Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s foot creme, it still wasn&#x27;t healing.  And it was getting more and more painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching (google) treatment, I saw that they recommended shaving the heel and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went out an bought this.  Soaked my heel, dried it off and scraped off as much I could, then treated with the Burts Bee&#x27;s creme.  Repeated the next day.&lt;br /&gt;After about a week, it was completely gone and heeled.  Went to Hawaii the next  month and abused my feet but the cracked heel never returned.</li>
    <li> Turns out I didn&#x27;t need the blade at all--only the rasp which works excellently.  Only negative is I must be pressing too hard as the rasp has a tendency to dislodge.  It&#x27;s easy to re-attach though.  This is better than any other product I&#x27;ve bought for in between salon visits.</li>
    <li> This is the single best tool for cracked and dry skin and or calluses on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;That being said I should say; I haven&#x27;t used the razor part of this tool.&lt;br /&gt;I had thick dried and callused skin around both heals and on the ball of both feet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried creams. I&#x27;ve even used creams that stayed on over night in cotton socks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of pumice stones with the same lack of success that&lt;br /&gt;I had with the creams.&lt;br /&gt;That was before I found this tool. I haven&#x27;t used the razor end. I&#x27;ve only need the&lt;br /&gt;rasp. The calluses on my heals were very dry and cracked; it was quiet thick.&lt;br /&gt;I spread out my use over a few days, so I didn&#x27;t injure my feet. From the first few&lt;br /&gt;minutes it was clear that this thing was working well. The rasp is slightly curved&lt;br /&gt;and has a compartment under it where callus dust is caught. Thats one the nice&lt;br /&gt;features of this tool; very little dust falls anywhere but into this compartment.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on dry feet. It&#x27;s easy to empty the dust from the compartment below the&lt;br /&gt;rasp. You just tap the end onto a tissue, or into a drain and the dust falls out. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t want to take a razor to my feet but the rasp attracted my attention.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m very happy with the result. I spread out the \\&quot;sanding\\&quot; of the calluses and,&lt;br /&gt;used a small about of triple antibiotic on any place I did sanding just to be safe; after&lt;br /&gt;I finished sanding for any given day.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are 100% better after using this rasp tool.</li>
    <li> It falls apart very easily and takes a while to show results</li>
    <li> It really works. Removed painful calluses. Has a safety cover for the razor. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things to get rid of the ugly, rough, cracked skin on my heels... lotions, sloughing creams, that useless pedegg thing. Shame I didn&#x27;t just buy this from Tweezerman first. I mean, wow... I&#x27;ve just used it twice, two days in a row, and my heels are clean and smooth. I actually used the rasp part even more than the shaver, but using the two were just the one-two punch my poor heels needed. Both parts of the tool are gentle but effective. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product cuts out dead skin and leaves healthy skin alone. It is really simple and has a nice design.</li>
    <li> All of these devices are pretty much that same: same mechanism, build, etc.  The key is the blade, and this one comes with a very good Sollingen steel one.  Problem is that it arrived broken: the clear, plastic slide casing that allows movement between the rasp and the blade in two halves that could not be rejoined.  Give me real German manufacturing anyday!  Disappointing, but not worth returning.</li>
    <li> I work in a professional environment which requires me to wear heels all day.  When I&#x27;m not wearing heels, I slip on my sandals... all which contribute to my dry, rough feet.  I have hated that my feet look so bleh, so I bought this based on the reviews to hopefully improve my conditions.  I think this was mentioned in one, if not more, review, but I definitely feel the need to say it again: it came with NO instructions (except how to replace the blade).  It doesn&#x27;t say if you should use it wet or dry, how much pressure to apply, etc.  I blindly started attempting to use it and nothing was really happening, so naturally I pressed harder.  I started getting some stuff off, not what I was expecting... eventually it went too deep and I ended up with a bloody foot, which I could not get to stop.  I was devastated.  My feet looked worse than before I used it.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works great on callouses</li>
    <li> The item reviews seemed a little too good to be true, but I&#x27;d tried the PedEgg and other products to no avail. The first time I tried to use the shaver I thought I&#x27;d been dupped again... as the bad reviews said, the blade popped off and I was unable to remove any of my calluses. I put the product away disappointed, but then used it again after a long day at work being desperate to give my feet some relief. After soaking my feet, I applied slight pressure to the moist calluses and the shaver started to peel off the dead skin immediately. Two of my most annoying calluses are now completely gone... some of the bigger ones are still intact but are much smaller than what they were initially. It only took TEN MINUTES for the shaver to remove the two calluses that I&#x27;ve been bothered with for years. Be patient with this product, but it is most definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I hate to get pedicures.  But, I have rough skin on the ball and heels of my feet, as well as on the bottom of both big toes.  I tried softening the rough skin with gobs of lotion after showering and then quickly putting on socks, but I still had rough feet that snagged on our smooth bedsheets, and probably killed the \\&quot;ooh-la-la\\&quot; factor of playing footsie with my husband.  Foot files didn&#x27;t work either, I had to do a lot of work to make a dent in my thick, rough skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought this callus shaver on amazon after reading the reviews.  When I heard that this callus shaver was best used on wet feet, I tried to use it in the shower.  That didn&#x27;t work (the shaver ran uselessly over my calluses, even when applying pressure), nor did it work on really wet feet once I was out of the shower.  The best way, for me, to use this is to shower, towel off my feet thoroughly so my feet were then dry, and then use this shaver.  Worked like a charm.  It&#x27;s probably wrong to get as much joy as I do from seeing long peels o&#x27; rough foot skin come off with this shaver.  I use this once or twice a week and get a satisfying amount of dead skin off without injuring myself.  It&#x27;s been almost two months, and don&#x27;t see any need to get a replacement shaver blade yet.  (I don&#x27;t use the rasp part at all.)  I love it, and wish I&#x27;d bought it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** Sept 16, 2008:  I&#x27;ve finally used the rasp part!  I have a length-wise rough bit on the ball of my foot, just below my 2nd toe, on each foot.  They each just look like a line, but they&#x27;re almost a crack.  I couldn&#x27;t get to it with the shaver, or, I could, but the shaver didn&#x27;t have anything to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; on, since the surrounding skin is soft.  So I used the rasp on it, which reminds me of a grater for nutmeg or something.  But, it worked very quickly without having to apply a lot of pressure.  Viola!  Soft skin again, no trace of the weird crack on each foot.  I&#x27;m kicking myself in the head for not using the rasp sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** February 2012:  Still have this callus shaver and I still love it!  A few years ago I bought a box of Tweezerman blades for this shaver and that little box has lasted me a long time.  After using the callus shaver I&#x27;ll put a lotion with AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) or urea (sounds gross but it isn&#x27;t) on my feet.  AHA and urea are great softening ingredients.  I&#x27;ve got soft feet ready for sandal season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** February 2012:  Still have this callus shaver and I still love it!

    <li> This thing works great!  I feel 2\\&quot; shorter now, and my feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  If you are troubled by rough, calloused feet, buy one of these and get busy.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo13MHMSEWIOUC8]]I had always had a fair amount of calluses on my hands from sports over the years, but it wasn&#x27;t until I started rock climbing regularly that I experienced a few near-tears of large callus &#x27;plates&#x27; that I had to start taking care of my hands more seriously.  A few gymnast friends said they always used regular razors for their calluses, but I was looking for something safer, and the addition of the rasp was pretty much what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like lots of other commenters, it was a bit tricky to figure out how the whole blade receptacle thing worked.  The instructions on the back of the box are pretty useless and don&#x27;t include a single picture, and I had zero experience with any similar products.  After having finally taken the thing apart and putting it back together I now understand the very simple design of it, but that only makes the instructions on the box seem even less relevant, and more confusing.  So let me explain it the way it made sense to me...</li>
    <li> I like this tool. Tired of grinding with files (the one on this is more aggressive too). A few runs across my feet and a run with the file and I&#x27;m good. My feet itch a lot less and smoother.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife ... she found all she needed was the rasp ... yet it has the blade if you have harder callouses</li>
    <li> What hard skin? None on feet when you use Tweezerman. Great products.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased extra blades in case I couldn&#x27;t find them again. Used to buy these products in a store that closed.</li>
    <li> I have no previous experiences with this kind of shaver before. Thus it took me quite a while figuring out how to use it. Another review also mentions the lack of instruction. The video on Amazon&#x27;s product page is very informative about changing blade, which is important because I have to remove the blade in order to clean it after use. As to how to remove dead skin, I had to search other online videos.  Anyway, after I figured out how to use it, I found this shave super easy to use and super efficient. It works much better than all other callus removers I&#x27;ve used before. The blades are quite sharp, and I ended up bleeding in my first use. But overall I think it&#x27;s a very good tool.</li>
    <li> This arrived yesterday and is possibly the best $14 I have spent on a beauty product ever! I had no issues using it and my feet are like new. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This was a great deal and works really well.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who want&#x27;s a great deal at a great price!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I decided to try it.  Well, it does a good job but I was worried at first that it could take too much off.  With practice and a light hand, it works great.  I tried the pedegg but it never did enough for the edges of the heals that go bad with age.</li>
    <li> I have the worst heels known to man. I am overweight, and I mostly wear slip-on shoes without socks. In addition, I grew up in high humidity and now live in a really dry climate, which makes my skin overall very dry and flakey. My heels have always been very calloused, and pumice stones wouldn&#x27;t even touch them. No matter what heavy-duty skin creme, heel remedy, or hardcore \\&quot;fix-it\\&quot; product I tried, nothing worked. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for the past week and my heels look better than they have ever looked. They look like normal heels, and they are so smooth and soft! I am amazed at how a 10 dollar device can make such a difference. It&#x27;s easy to use and completely pain free, as long as you are careful with the blade. Get this!</li>
    <li> Nail salons are no longer allowed to use the razor shavers for callouses.  This tool is easy to use, safe, and does a fabulous job on my recurring callous on the ball of my foot.</li>
    <li> I love this I use it every day. My feet feel amazing after about 2 uses my feet are so soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a CrossFit&#x27;er and needed something to trim down my hand calluses.&lt;br /&gt;Within 5 minutes of getting it my hands now feel so much better and hopefully this will help to keep me from tearing them.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Works better than any other product and easy to use. Don&#x27;t leave sitting on side of wet tub, it will rust.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is comparable to others of the same type... It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Feels tough and sturdy. Built to last. Works as advertised. I use this to shave down calluses on my hand I get from working out. Recommended to anyone with the same issue.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tool I&#x27;ve used for removing calluses on my hands. It&#x27;s easy to handle and leaves a nice clean finish. I found this after getting my first ripped callus on the pullup bar. If you do CrossFit and ever experienced a ripped callus, you know how unpleasant the next few days are at the gym. I keep the Tweezerman in my gym bag in case I need any last second callus maintenance before a WOD. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> The blade slips and slides, don&#x27;t know how to make it stay. Very frusting to use, scares me to play with it and figure out how to control it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I swear I practically went down a shoe size after using this tool once. Just be sure to only use the razor side after a shower, or after your feet have been soaking.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this.  Works better than anything else out there.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> A must have for crossfit.</li>
    <li> I live in AZ and am constantly wearing flip flops.  This is a product that I definitely need and I&#x27;m sorry that I never bought one sooner.  It worked great on my heals and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Sent on time and am so glad I purchased this product</li>
    <li> Nice tool. Not very good directions.  Have to pop out the little white packing insert to use. Took a while to figure it out&lt;br /&gt;Great for touch ups between pedicures. Use after the shower or bath on softened Caluses.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail today and when i proceeded to open it I am sure as everyone did, I could not for the LIFE of me figure out how to work it... the directions were TERRIBLE. This is the only reason i gave it only 2 stars... I had to watch the video from one of the other reviews that was posted to figure it out. How on earth this company thinks that those directions are accurate is beyond me. They don&#x27;t even mention the white cover... really? Anyway, once i figured it out this is a great product, works great and i can&#x27;t wait to use it often... but please please Tweezerman update your directions to include how to actually use the product. I will, for this reason alone, not buy anything else from this company.</li>
    <li> I love this item, but it should come with better instructions.  Can&#x27;t get it to work?  There&#x27;s a little white plug near the base of the blade.  Pop it totally out.  Viola.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know.  It made me feel stupid, too.  But it does look like a built in part of the item, so don&#x27;t feel bad.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> For years I tried every pedicurist and foot file known to mankind, trying to get the nasty crust off my feet.  Nothing worked.  I was desperate!  The tweezerman callus shaver is awesome.  I&#x27;ve been using it for four weeks now, and my feet are smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I haven&#x27;t cut myself either, no bleeding.  Each morning after I shower, I shave a little off my heels and the ball of my foot (you can&#x27;t take it all off at once, at little at a time every day works best).  Then put on some good good cream (try Aveeno intensive foot cream if you don&#x27;t want the expensive stuff).  Your feet MUST be wet from the shower--won&#x27;t work on dry skin (I tried it--not good).  Now, I&#x27;m off to buy replacement blades!</li>
    <li> Great product may have to repurchase soon mine got lost in the move</li>
    <li> my hubby uses this for his Parkour callous trimming. prevents wounds and sores.  great</li>
    <li> Good quality of construction, gets the job done.  Comes with one razor.  Easy to replace blades.  Wide handle for good grip, even when its wet.</li>
    <li> Love it! No instructions but a guy has a youtube videos that spells it all out. The white piece near the top is a safety guard. I removed it and have no idea why I would need it again. Press the 2 white buttons and it will pop out the other side. It  is amazing!  I have nicked myself a couple of time but didn&#x27;t even feel it.  I didn&#x27;t think there was hope for my heels until I found this. No pedicure has done what this has done at removing calluses and dead skin.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product. She had a cheaper one before this one. The old one didn&#x27;t have a callius file attached</li>
    <li> My feet build up pretty rough/painfull calluses and this thing shaves them down quickly and painlessly.  Makes life so much better.</li>
    <li> I used my razor in the shower so that my feet were wet--it worked fantastic! My feet were much more smooth. But the handy slider that protects you from the blade? That also traps water in there. I thought that the razor would be able to air dry (after all, the directions said NOTHING about taking the razor apart in order to let it air dry) but low and behold...it&#x27;s completely rusted. I thought about trying to clean the rust off so that I was still able to use it, but really...who wants to risk shaving themselves with a rusty razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had to toss it...after only one use. The entire thing had rust on it--not just the razor. I might buy another. But I&#x27;m really disappointed that it rusted. My regular razor doesn&#x27;t rust. I don&#x27;t want to have to take it completely apart every time I use it and have a razor blade lying around.</li>
    <li> This had such amazing reviews and I wanted to believe it would work on my rough feet, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. It actually fell apart and cut my foot really badly when I was using it. I don&#x27;t understand how everyone else got it to work so great, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all and I threw it in the trash. I wished there had been real directions and even though I found a simple how-to video online it still didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This handy little tool is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for to keep my heels smooth. Don&#x27;t know why nobody carries them in-store though, so I had to buy online.</li>
    <li> The rasp kept coming off, and the unit had a cheap feel to it.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  The razor part is a little scary to use at first, but is by far the most satisfying.  The shaver is a perfectly viable alternative if the callous is hard to each or you&#x27;re scared to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Had difficulty removing the blade. You must be carefull when doing this!</li>
    <li> Love this multi purpose tool.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great price. The pedicure razor is exactly as described. It works great and I highly recommend it for in between pedicures.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my rough heels...and boy does it work!  it took me a little bit to figure it out but now I am an expert!  just a little warning, watch out taking too much off at first because your skin becomes so soft it becomes hard to walk on them.</li>
    <li> Where was this when I was rowing in college?  Picked the sport back up recently and this thing is the best tool I&#x27;ve ever found for managing hand calluses.</li>
    <li> While I was following a video about how to insert the blade, the blade that came with shaver fell out. It looked very dirty - as did the inside of the shaver where the razor is positioned. So I discarded the dirty razor and carefully washed the shaver, rinsed with hot water and soaked in alcohol. Then I inserted a fresh blade. I gave this product an okay rating because I am just learning to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this exact remover before. I just needed another. Its the best on the market because of the safety feature. I cut myself with all of the others i have tried. This one is just like a potato peeler for your feet and you dont cut yourself unless you are extremely careless.</li>
    <li> I use a women&#x27;s plastic leg shaver; they are cheaper less likely to cause deep wounds. I&#x27;m a chick and I have minute hair on my legs, so, in the shower, I just extended the use of the shaver: not just my legs, but also my foot caluses.</li>
    <li> This is an odd tool, and the I strongly suggest you go on youtube and watch the videos about how to install the blade and then how to use the device.  It&#x27;s not really intuitive--at least it wasn&#x27;t for me--and seeing it done makes it 1,000 times easier.  You are sliding the blade over the top of your skin, parallel to the surface of your skin, while pressing down lightly.  Regular soft skin bends under the blade and is untouched and unshaved.  Hard calluses do not bend, and they are shaved off.  If you&#x27;ve ever used a hand plane to smooth a board, this tool works in a very similar fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s nice about this as opposed to an emery board or pumice stone is that you don&#x27;t have the heat from the friction of the stone wearing off the callus.  At the same time, for me at least, it is a bit disconcerting to slice off strips of callus.  Just odd to be taking a razor blade to your feet.  Once you get over that feeling, though, it is remarkable how quickly and easily this device can reduce a large callus, and how it protects the surrounding non-callused skin.</li>
    <li> works like a charm, very easy to use and clean, just a little difficult to reload the blade, have to be very careful. other than that love it.</li>
    <li> Callus shaver trims calluses painlessly and generally stops cutting when the callus is gone.  You can scrape non-callused skin with this tool, but you have to really work at it. The rasp is interesting, but must be for larger callused areas (the heel for example); I have toe calluses and this takes a smooth surface slice with each pull stroke. Note that there is a white plastic guard below the blade; remove it of it won&#x27;t cut anything. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT but my blade dulled super super fast. You can get them much cheaper elsewhere for better quality. I probably wouldn&#x27;t but this one again.</li>
    <li> Well constructed and functional for the price point. Effectively does the job following the simple instructions and care for your feet.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome - it works really well but you can easily remove too much skin if not careful!</li>
    <li> I bought this Tweezerman callous shaver after purchasing another brand that didn&#x27;t work well. This shaver stands up to the usual great quality of all the Tweezerman products I have tried in the past. It really works great!</li>
    <li> Okay, this is gross, but who has never had a painful corn or callus on their foot? I had one on my baby toe and it hurt! So, I ordered this callus shaver. It is very sharp, so be careful with it. It has a safety sheild over the blade, but go easy at first until you see how it works on you. I got excellent results on my corn by first using a medicated corn pad for a few days to soft up the dead skin. Then, I went to work with the callus shaver. It was much easier to use after the corn pad treatment and quickly removed the corn. If medicated corn pads are not right for your foot problem, try using the callus shaver after a bath or shower that softens your skin a bit. Otherwise, you might find that the shaver cuts too much off at once. My problem has been gone for a few weeks now and I have had no more pain. The rasp part is good, too, sort of like a \\&quot;ped egg\\&quot;. This tool is a nice \\&quot;two-fer\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The razor part works really well and has a plastic cover for safety.  The rasp is a little too small and cheap.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  I bought it for me, but my husband used it, and I think he likes more than I do.  He&#x27;s trying to steal it from me.  I told him to get his own.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this little tool! I have the nastiest calloused feet and have tried several creams and tools...you name it, I have tried it....this just shaves away the dry skin without harming any good skin. I would highly recommend ordering the refill blades when ordering this. My blade was dull with about 4 uses and I had to wait on more blades. This tool is a must and I must say my favorite in my quest for halfway normal looking feet! I tried soaking before using and the skin just gets all trapped in the blade. So for my feet it worked best using on the dry skin. Like other reviewers had suggested, go a little at a time with the shaving or you will be walking on tender feet for a couple of days. I learned this lesson the hard way.</li>
    <li> My hubby uses this for his hand calluses and I use it for my feet and it works wonders. It removes all the callus! I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, sort of. The safety prevents effective use. It took me three times as long using this shaver as it would have with another type. The rasp is so small, I have no use for it either. Overall, my feeling about this product is, &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best thing that has ever happened to my feet.  I had rough skin on my heels since I can remember. When I say rough I mean the ugly thick horseshoe-resembling layer of grayish substance covering my heels - catching on carpets, painful to walk on, occasionally cracking, stocking destroying. I actually was too embarrassed to go to a salon for  pedicure.  I tried everything that I could think of - tons of different files and rasps, pumice stones, creams and lotions, electric devices. I just wasn&#x27;t able to get THAT off my feet - no matter what I did. I&#x27;ve never seen pink healthy skin on my heels until this Tweezerman Callus Shaver happened to me - and my life changed.  It was somewhat tricky to make it work at first but I was determined and did figure it out. The problem was not to understand how the shaver works but to actually make it work, because pressure, angle and force are the variables that make all the difference. You need to try many times to really feel how to move your callus shaver and make it work efficiently. The learning process was on the longer side (20-30 minutes maybe?), and I cut myself badly once (as with any razors, never move your shaver sideways!) - but I didn&#x27;t care. All I needed was the result - whatever the price.  I spent at least an hour in a bathtub shaving off strips of dead skin layer from my heels. And after I was done - ta-da! My heels were all pink and soft (and unevenly shaved) - for the first time in my adult life! Unbelievable! I still remember that amazing feeling that so many people take for granted - stepping on your heels and actually feeling the floor, even feeling the air! Wow! I&#x27;m used to that feeling now and don&#x27;t notice it anymore.  Two years have passed and my heels have been very happy. I use my callus remover once a week - after I shower, because your dead skin needs to be very soft to let the razor cut through it. The central button of my shaver broke causing the cover to fell off but, again, I donot care. Who needs the cover anyway? The shaver still gets the job done and I love, love, love my callus shaver!  As for the negative reviews of people who were not able to use the device, I&#x27;ll say this: just keep trying! As soon as you figure out how to use your callus remover you will be happy you have!  And one more thing: when replacing the blade, it&#x27;s easy to put it upside down - this hides the cutting edge of the blade and prevents the whole thing from being able to shave. Make sure you can see the blade edge when you have assembled the thing!</li>
    <li> If you have dry heels, you need this. There is nothing better out there for smoothing your feet.  It will save you hours of scraping with a rasp or foot-ped. This is not like the Revlon product that keeps falling apart when you try to use it.  Very sturdy. So strong I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to replace the blade when needed.  But in the meantime, it is a terrific tool. The setting on it is such that it would be very hard to cut yourself unless you were very careless.</li>
    <li> Love this for clearing that dry skin off my feet.  The included foot buffer is an added bonus.  Works like a charm and replacement blades are dual sided and cheap.  Happy about this item.</li>
    <li> My foot callus has migrated to the underside of my foot and you have to watch it when you are cutting where you can&#x27;t see. I have cut too deeply at times and drawn blood but I am learning to take it easy and stroke diagonally and very lightly. I like the rasp for smoothing out the rough edges. A handy tool.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong but I can&#x27;t get it to scrape anything off</li>
    <li> Tried several others but the wife loved this one ... beware of cheap imitations,  this one is the real deal.</li>
    <li> It works, but it&#x27;s more work than anticipated.  I really have to shave at flaking skin from multiple angles before it really comes off.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.  I use both the shaver and rasp, so don&#x27;t neglect the fact that this has both!  I use this with an Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover, which is awesome!  Great for men like myself who are vain about their feet but too manly to set foot in a nail salon ;-)</li>
    <li> I have a problem with the balls of my foots that causes callus to develop.  These Callus then end up pushing against nerves and cause me much pain.  Before I bought this unit I had to go to the foot doctors and have him shave them down.  Tweezerman does the job I use to pay the foot doctor to do.  It&#x27;s safe to use and works best in the shower when your foot skin is wet and soft.  I would recommend this product to anyone with similar foot problems.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  The blade is still sharp after many uses, and my feet are as smooth as ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible.  Don&#x27;t dare change the blade or take it apart. I haven&#x27;t even used mine. It&#x27;s impossible to use without someone else&#x27;s help.</li>
    <li> It keeps my feet looking great.  It&#x27;s seems very safe, I have never cut myself and I just ordered more blades.  The original blade is still fine, but I want to be ready when I need a new one.</li>
    <li> I wear work boots all day 16hrs or more every day and no matter what boot it is I get some really rough feet.. This tool works magic just painlessly cutting away dead skin leaving soft new skin. No more complaints about my feet scratching her legs in bed and they don&#x27;t look like dry reptile toes.</li>
    <li> Was happy to get it but it fell apart  Scent back</li>
    <li> This will readily remove any raised skin from your body, even if it is not dead and actually belongs there.  You have to be careful, because after all, you&#x27;re putting a razor directly on your skin.  I shaved down a toe callus too much and it bled like a mother.</li>
    <li> Product is good at best. The main reason for the three star review is because when you use the end that has the scraper, you have to physically hold it to keep it from sliding off. It&#x27;s a product flaw that needs correcting.</li>
    <li> The space where the blade goes on the shaver end is just too narrow of an opening. All I can do is rub it on my foot, it doesn&#x27;t shave anything off!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works great !!</li>
    <li> It took a while to learn how to use it. There were no instructios. You would think it is a no-brainer, but it took about 5 minutes to learn how to use it. I think the plastic handle could be more practical and less cosmetic, Once you learn howe to use it, it removes dead skin nicely. For me it &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; sections of dead skin about 1/2 inch by 1/8 inch; so it takes a while to complete both feet. However the removal rate, for me, is much greater than the raspy time dead skin removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $10 it was a wothwhile purchase</li>
    <li> Only thing that works to get the extra callus off the bottom of my feet.  I use both the razor part to get off rebuilding scar tissue from a neuroma surgery and also use the raspier part to smooth areas.  Be sure to completely dry the skin after a shower or soak.</li>
    <li> I am extremely frustrated with the rough and dry sky under my foot. This is my only health and personal health nightmare. Nothing worked until I found this.   step1. soak your feet  step2. dry for a couple of minutes  step3. test before you peel off the rough skin.  Life saver product.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have terribly callused heels. They crack and are sometimes painful. I&#x27;ve tried everything and can&#x27;t find anything to get rid of it. This product does the trick. It took several times of doing it because I was very careful to only remove small amounts of the callus at one time. If you remove too much, it is painful (even if it doesn&#x27;t hurt at the time you&#x27;re removing it, it will the next day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am giving this product only 4 stars because THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS! I don&#x27;t know about you but I think instructions are important when you&#x27;re playing with razors. Immediately after opening the package, I was trying to figure out how it worked and accidentally released the razor blade. It fell and sliced my finger open in the process. It was not a small cut either - it bled profusely and was painful for a week. You won&#x27;t find instructions online either. The best thing to do it just look at the image of the product and set the razor so it looks like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works best if you use it when your feet are slightly damp (like 5-10 mins after getting out of the shower). If you do it while they&#x27;re too wet, it won&#x27;t work. The rasp is just ok - I&#x27;ve used it every now and then but it doesn&#x27;t make a noticeable difference for me. I usually just use the shaver for removing the callus them use a pumice stone to smooth out the area.</li>
    <li> I will use this product every day but I took off two stars for two reasons  1) This product does not work well on calluses that I have directly under my toes. It does not seem like it wants to catch on the skin up there and I have bad calluses from wearing thong sandals a lot all summer that I cannot remove.  2) If you have small calluses on your toes like me this also is not the best product as it becomes very easy to cut yourself while trying to get at your toes.   Now this product works great for my heels (hard to do the side you can&#x27;t see though by yourself  and the sides of your feet. But it is not a solution to complete callus removal. However I will keep it around as it made my feet a hell of a lot better after I got back from a long trip to Vietnam.</li>
    <li> This crap fell apart with my first use. The spring that holds the little button in place popped out and so did the button. The blade also fell off while I was using it. The Callus Shaver itself is alright. Nothing to write home about unless you are warning someone not to waste $10 on this thing. I should have just gone with a cheaper model. I&#x27;m sure the same results could be achieved and I wouldn&#x27;t feel such a way about it.</li>
    <li> I use this callus remover to remove calluses from my hand due to working out. I no longer have ripped open hands or blisters. The blade on the remover is protected so it can only cut small layers off at a time so no cutting in to non callused skin.</li>
    <li> This really works well and keeps the callouses down without pain and only a bit of a mess. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t cut non-callous parts of the foot.</li>
    <li> it is very effective to remove the callus under my feet but be careful don&#x27;t push too hard, I cut myself once.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for people with calluses on hard to reach places on their feet.  For example, I have pretty substantial calluses in the middle of both my feet, right below my toes.  Prior to purchasing this shaver, I had been experimenting with a number of different callus files and callus treatment sprays - all to no effect.  The main problem is that traditional callus files are too bit and bulky to target anything that is not on the ball or heel of the foot.  But this shaver can get anywhere, and works exactly as it promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take me a while to figure out the correct angle and pressure to use for maximal effectiveness.  And I have had much better results using this on dry skin versus wet skin (although I assume this is just a matter of personal preference).  But once I played around a bit, this shaver performed better than ALL of the foot files I had purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you have a longtime callus problem - and traditional foot files, peda-eggs, and callus smoothers are just not cutting it (Pun fully intended).</li>
    <li> If you have really calloused feet, this thing is great. The callous files that I&#x27;ve used before are nothing compared to this thing.  In a few minutes I had removed callous that would have taken me months to file off with one of the traditional solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how so many people have cut themselves with it.  I was pretty haphazard with it and didn&#x27;t get any cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rasp on the thing is pretty terrible.  It slid out of its socket several times while using it.  But that&#x27;s not the reason I got the thing.  I wanted it for the razor side.  I find I can use it after a shower or even when my feet are completely dry.  Seems to work better if just after a shower, though.</li>
    <li> Flimsier than a previous shaver I had, but generally does the job.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t scrape too many successive times over one spot or you&#x27;ll get down to live tissue!  Otherwise, very effective.</li>
    <li> I do weightlifting. This shaver is great for removing calluses on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars because some spots on the hands are hard to reach if not near impossible.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the Tweezerman Safety Slide Callus Shaver with Rasp and at first sight was reluctant to use it. The shaver is not bad at all, but the blade sure as hell is. I needed to peel off some dead skin, so I tried to lightly slide as directed on the instructions, and it would continually want to sink in deeper causing bleeding. The product works, but it hurts in the process.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for crossfit! Able to maintain callus&#x27;s and havent ripped since purchasing and using. I is a great item for anyone who finds thier palms ripping often.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! FOR $10 IT IS AWFUL! IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS FROM 29 CENT STORE.THE SHAVER CUTS YOU THE OTHER PART DOES NOT WORK.IT IS CHEAPLY MADE!I SAW THIS IN STORES LIKE $2.I WANT A FULL REFUND!</li>
    <li> Really helped my toe. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Instructions were weak as you are dealing with sharp blades.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying one of these, only because I lost my first one. It lasts forever! Be careful and gentle or you could injure yourself. Read the directions carefully, using gently, soft strokes! I hurt myself years ago by using it on dry feet! If you know what you&#x27;re doing and you need a callus shaver, this is the PERFECT one!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about whether this would work after trying the pedegg which didn&#x27;t work at all.  While the file on this doesn&#x27;t do much the shaver works great at removing dead skin.  The first think I have tried that works.  Highly recommend for that use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used standards single edge razor blades for years to keep my corns at bay, once you get used to the method it works well and gives you the control you need to shave off what you need to and not cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where this item has the issue.  It has one shaving depth and if you&#x27;re just trying to get a little off the top it isn&#x27;t a good device.  This is fine for giant thick corns that haven&#x27;t been kept up with in awhile but if you&#x27;re going after a regular maintenance routine the one depth fits all won&#x27;t work too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device appears to be well constructed, the sliding safety shield is actually pretty cool and I like the rasp but I&#x27;m going back to the simple single edged razor for control purposes.  Cheaper, easier and does exactly what I need.  I&#x27;ll hang onto this for the rasp side but I won&#x27;t be using the corn razor again.</li>
    <li> It worked okay the first couple of times but the blade became dull very quickly, I had hoped and expected it to last longer.</li>
    <li> Product is great, but with arthritis is difficult to load. Suggestions appreciated for that task. Will have my spouse give me a helping  hand</li>
    <li> I got this yesterday and used it this morning. It worked extremely well. I am not flexible anymore so it is not easy to get my feet in a position to see what I am doing and to do it, but this product worked so quickly that I was able to get the job done before I reached the point where I couldn&#x27;t twist my foot that way any longer. The rasp worked way better than the ones I have bought over the years, so I am satisfied with how the product works. The instructions, or lack thereof, are another case. They are very obscure and incomplete. I finally went online and watched a few videos and read a bunch of reviews and figured it out, but why can&#x27;t they tell you the rasp slides off the end for easy cleaning? Or that you need to pop out the little blade shield? I did figure that out very quickly on my own, but it would have been nice to have had a little heads&#x27; up. It is a nice tool, but their customer service needs work. Many older people don&#x27;t have access to a computer or knowledge of finding and using videos and reviews online, and with arthritis and other problems, operating things isn&#x27;t as easy as it once was. I give the product 5 stars for usage and no stars for instructions, hence the 4 stars above.</li>
    <li> I am a CrossFitter and keeping calluses in check helps prevent hand tears.  I was not having luck with several other products but this thing is awesome. A little freaky how it works but it does the job!</li>
    <li> It does remove dead skin, but use it cautiously. My husband started going at it a little fast and ended up bleeding.</li>
    <li> I read reviews to get an idea of how to use this, having never used one (though needed it!) before.&lt;br /&gt;Price was cheap enough I wanted to see how it worked. Instructions only tell you how to change the blade. Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right and not sure how far to go, but it works. I just wish I knew how to use it correctly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, but the plastic guard came off completely after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Expecting it to do more. Feels like it either doesn&#x27;t go deep enough or sometimes too deep. Not as good as nail salon ones.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use even with instructions&lt;br /&gt;it seemed to be more complicated than I thought it would be</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst thing I have ever bought on amazon. It is impossible to change the blades, I never even got to use it! Went straight into the trash. I should have realized it was a bad purchase since so many people who bought it commented on how hard it was to change the blade. It really shouldn&#x27;t have to be so hard.</li>
    <li> I had a really hard time using this product. It kinda works but i bought it to remove hand calluses from working out and it was definitely not much helpful. Need easier way to use it or come with instructions. Had a hard time replacing blade as well. Actually broke the blade while doing it and threw this away.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...much better (and sharper, so be careful) than cheaper ones at local chain stores. Retractable safety feature makes it even better (that did break but I was able to tape it and it functions fine.)</li>
    <li> Those cheese graters (Microplane) and diamond sandpaper thingy&#x27;s take forever to remove minute amounts of callous.  This thing literally carves the callouses off like \\&quot;butta\\&quot; (that&#x27;s my best NY accent - hehe).  Miraculously, even when used dry (I use it dry and my Wife uses it wet), it somehow manages to NOT cut into the good, pink skin below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible to overdue it but I have never seriously injured myself.  Just a day or two of soreness is the worst encounter I have had.  But now I know how long to use it for which is not long at all.  I have very large amounts of callous all around the edges of my heel - and this works because it is sharp, aggressive, and as scary as it sounds . . it \\&quot;slices off\\&quot; the excess tissue.  How it does not cut the sensitive skin is a mystery to me.  You just press lightly to shave off thin layers or hard to shave off thick layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY - add cream - any cream - your feet will feel like . . . well, like \\&quot;BUTTA\\&quot; ! !</li>
    <li> Very difficult to change the blades.  Don&#x27;t pull too hard on the case - it breaks very easily.  I have broken 2 of these in as many weeks.</li>
    <li> First I must disclose, I almost always purchase Tweezerman callus shavers and tweezers. This company is the top in the field of beauty tools. The only time I don&#x27;t buy Tweezerman is when it is not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews of this product before I purchased. I purchased it despite the bad reviews. Again, I&#x27;ve used their callus shavers in the past so I knew what I was getting. With that said, I don&#x27;t think the reviewers that complained about cutting their feet understood the nature of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is geared toward really, tough, dry and cracked feet. Embarrassingly, my feet are such. The skin on my feet doesn&#x27;t renew and fall off as fast as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;. The Tweezerman callus shaver helps the process of dead skin removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your feet have a few rough spots, this is not the tool for you. I would recommend a pumice stone or another product sold on here named &amp;#34;Mr. Pumice&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, when you use this product you should have a light hand. Tweezerman razors are sharp. Digging into your skin aggressively with this tool may cut your foot. I believe the reviewers were using it incorrectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new style callus remover by Tweezerman comes with a safety slide. This is great if you store your callus remover with the razor attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rasp is also great for light filing. I use the rasp after I use the callus shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend soaking your feet then applying a liquid callus remover. Then allow the liquid callus remover to penetrate the dead skin. Thirdly, using Tweezerman callus shaver to remove the stubborn dead skin that remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hands of someone with harsh feet, product knowledge and a light hand it is the right tool. Otherwise, you may want to stick to the pumice stones or over the counter, inexpensive callus shavers.</li>
    <li> Wish I knew about this product before. Wear flip flops all the time and it beats up my feet to where they crack. Used this after the shower a couple times and my feet are back to normal. Great product</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this product was for the callus shaver. It works great. I use it as soon as I get out of the shower, one or two times a week. Be sure to dry the excess water off first, or it will just slide right across, accomplishing nothing. I&#x27;ve tried using the rasp quite a few times, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I guess the holes are too small to make as big of an impact as I was hoping for. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> This callus remover does not work well. There is not enough razor material to do the job. I do not recommend this tool.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the razor part, but ended up loving the rasp.  I highly recommend this product to smooth out calluses or rough skin on your feet.  After using less than a week, my heels were completely &amp;#34;healed.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a blade. Yes, I&#x27;m still a bit concerned and careful when I use it... BUT, IT ACTUALLY WORKS! I&#x27;m extremely impressed. Toss your Ped Egg in the trash; they&#x27;re a huge waste of money. I got one and thought sandpaper would work better. Callus stones can work, but are just too slow. The file on this item also works quite well, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade has a maximum depth, so it will not take too much skin at once. You do not need to use a lot of pressure, and will want to start parallel with the skin surface. I do NOT recommend taking a shower before using this product. It does have trouble getting a slice started on moist skin, so when you get through the callus, you usually do know when to start being careful. It stops cutting easily with living most skin. If you shower, you will likely apply too much pressure to the wet skin surface to get the cut started and end up with a bloody mess. On a dry surface, with gentle parallel pressure, it almost automatically stops cutting on its own when you need to stop. The blade does not work well on concave curves, so getting just below your toes will just not happen; you will never get the cut started. However, cuts will start very easily on convex dry surfaces, so you need to be more cautious when using it on the ball of your foot. This is specifically what I got it for. Just don&#x27;t start using it aimlessly without watching or become complacent. The only bad thing is that the blade edge is hidden at the bottom of the metal square piece, and the metal piece seems fairly large with the square at 1\\&quot;x1\\&quot; not including the taper to the handle. This design really can&#x27;t be avoided. It is what it is. This is the best that I&#x27;ve found out on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of it, get a feel for where the blade is located, and get over your fear, you will never turn back. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product works great! Very easy to use and does the job,  Much better than other brands that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love pedicures but it is illegal to use callus shavers at professional salons in my state.  As an instructor, I am on my feet a lot and have developed calluses over the years that hurt if they are not taken care of on a regular basis.  (Nothing seems to work well except for a callus shaver.) I can go to a salon in a neighboring state where it is legal but I can only get there every month or so.  When I found this product I was excited and apprehensive.  I wanted to try it but was a little intimidated by the \\&quot;blade\\&quot;.  Long story short-it is fantastic!  This is a quality product and just what I need for maintenance between visits to the salon.  If I didn&#x27;t enjoy the rest of the pedicure, I wouldn&#x27;t need to go at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few hints for getting good results.  Soak your feet first in moderately hot water for about 15 minutes. (A nice long bath would work just fine.) Remove your foot from the water and then gently brush the shaver over the callus while the other foot is still soaking.  Do not use a heavy hand!  If need be, soak your foot a little longer then work on the callus again.  Your foot should not be dripping wet-just nice and hydrated.  Do not do this on dry feet.  Also, go ahead a purchase the extra blades. They are around $5 or so, and are worth having on hand when you need them.  Good luck!  This is a purchase worth making!</li>
    <li> Product worked fine but our only problem with it was that the only thing holding the razor in place is a small white plastic piece. This plastic piece does not like to stay in place and sometimes falls out which causes the razor to fall out! We stopped using this when the razor blade fell off and got lost somewhere in our couch! I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Never have I come across a product that removes dead/cracked skin SOO well! Money well spent &amp; can&#x27;t recommend enough. Hot tip: use straight after getting out if shower for best results.</li>
    <li> This thing has saved my feet, as calluses were seriously making walking more difficult. Because of a foot problem, I have had to wear very flat shoes that cause terrible calluses. I tried every kind of pumice out there, and this is the only thing that has really made a difference. Be careful - it is possible to hurt yourself with this thing.</li>
    <li> This callus shaver is similar to what they use at the nail salon. I know because I watch them carefully everytime I get a pedi. I don&#x27;t do pedi alot (partly because it&#x27;s so expensive), so I just do my own nails most of the time using nail wraps from 808.jamberrynails.net. I have cracked heels due to wearing open-heels footwear alot and I have the tendency to pick on them, peel them until they hurt. I got this and whenever I feel like peeling my heel, i went straight to this shaver. I never used it wet, I can see better when dry. I would recommend to do this over a trash can because I collected alot of dead skin. It works great! My heels feel like I stepped out the salon after I use it. I didn&#x27;t use the rasp much but that works too. For the price, it&#x27;s not bad. better than as seen on TV ones. hehe.</li>
    <li> I especially like the dual features ... having the rasp and the shaver together certainly is convenient.  I do think the safety slide should be a bit more robust, with a better means to remain in place while the product is in use.  It does have a tendency to slide around depending on how you hold the product, especially after the first few uses and I&#x27;d rather it stay put.  All in all, very convenient, and it does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> A razor is the only thing to get rid of my heel calluses and I&#x27;m so glad I found this.  I actually take the blade off and scrape my heels just like the podiatrist did.  The rasp on the other end smoothens out the lines and you have a perfect heel!</li>
    <li> best thing out there for dead skin</li>
    <li> Great! I love it! I&#x27;ve said all I need to say about the product. I&#x27;d recommend it. I do not have anymore to say about this product.</li>
    <li> This is a serious callous cutter.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s sharp enough and allows me to shave thin slices off my painful foot callouses.  The drawback is that the design does not let you see very clearly where you are cutting, so you have to work slowly and carefully to get the hang of it.  Other than that it&#x27;s great.  The rasp is also useful for callouses that protrude.</li>
    <li> Great for thick callous feet!!! A must have for women who care about their feet!! Easy , safe, convient ...and wonderful</li>
    <li> I purchased this callus shaver with vision of all the money I&#x27;d save by not getting pedicures at the salon, but I must say I am disappointed.  I don&#x27;t know if I have tougher or thicker calluses than other people, but I have not had the best of results with this product.  At the salon, I see strings of dead skin come off of their callus tools, but this product barely creates any, and then, only with more pressure from me than I feel really comfortable about.  Another thing: do not leave this item in the shower!  The blades are extremely prone to rusting- one or two days left there will render the blade totally unusable!      On a positive note, the rasp is useful and the design is pretty good.  I purchased a bunch of replacement blades from my local Beauty Brands (though they are also available here on Amazon) and I am hoping that will make a difference in how this product performs.</li>
    <li> I have no clue how to use this.  Was really looking forward to it, but there are NO instructions on how to use it, just on how to replace the blade.  POOR PRODUCT WHEN YOU CAN&#x27;T FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT</li>
    <li> Great item!! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Directions would be nice. Could not use for more than a month till finding another reviewers comments on how to get safety off to expose the blade. Even after that still doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Horrible! A waste of $12. If you want your heel shaved, keep going to the nail shops.</li>
    <li> This tool does a good job of removing thick callus, but I did manage to cut myself (my fault--it&#x27;s a razor!).  I was upset at cutting myself, and although I am not diabetic, I do worry about foot wounds.  I doubt I&#x27;ll use the razor part again, but the rasp is good.  Just FYI, I have used and like the Ped Egg.  It&#x27;s difficult to cut yourself with it, and it does shave off dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman Callus Shaver comes with no instructions except how to change the blade which is printed in a very tiny font on the back.</li>
    <li> I just about broke the handle by not paying attention when I first got the item.  Between that and negative reviews for not having operating instructions, here are some observations and tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Button on handle allows plastic cover to slide.  In one position, it covers the rasp, in the alternate position, it covers the razor.  It doesn&#x27;t come off, don&#x27;t push it past either locking position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Push the button that&#x27;s exposed and slide the cover towards alternate position, then change hand positions to finish repositioning the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor blade is as sharp as a razor blade:  don&#x27;t allow blade to move in a direction parallel to the edge while pressed against skin.  Pull the tool in a straight line perpendicular to the blade&#x27;s edge.  The blades will rust; I found that it&#x27;s better to remove the blade, dry it, the reinstall it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 important things to note:  1. Areas of the feet may become less sensitive with age so be very cautious where skin is less sensitive. 2.  The tool may remove more or less skin depending on how tough skin is, how much moisture is in skin, other characteristics of skin (like whether or not there&#x27;s fungus or calluses) and how much pressure is applied.  Start slow for best results.  Stop shaving and use the rasp if you&#x27;re not sure how much skin you have to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rasp is bi-directional, and it slides off for cleaning.  If it starts to slide off, push it back on or only use a pushing stroke.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would be an answer for me in my ongoing battle against callouses on the soles of my feet.  However, I found it sometimes works \\&quot;too good\\&quot; and ended up with an abrasion which is no fun.  But the most frustrating part was trying to change the blade.  The directions on the package are printed in extremely small print so you need a magnifying glass but even then its not a huge help because they aren&#x27;t clear.  It says to lay on a flat surface but it does not say which side to put down (face up or face down) or what to do once you lay it down.  I&#x27;m not a dumb person and usually can figure things out but I couldn&#x27;t figure this to save myself.  Finally emailed the company and they said they&#x27;d respond but they never did so I wasn&#x27;t happy with that.  I just found the video online which sort of shows you how to change the blade but the video isn&#x27;t great either.  The womans hands are in the way so once again you can&#x27;t see and it doesn&#x27;t say whether to lay product face up or face down.  They stress to be careful coz its very sharp and then zip through the directions rather glibly and talk way too fast so I still don&#x27;t get it and I&#x27;m not happy with the product or the instructions or the packaging or the company and I would not recommend it.  I have replacement blades which does me no good because its a mystery how to change them.  BUMMER (and I don&#x27;t usually write such critical reviews).  NOT HAPPY AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - changing the blade is sort of tricky for me but it can be done once you figure it out.  This item is helpful but also must be used carefully as you can draw blood if not judicious in using.  So I changed from 2 stars to 3.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found out about this when I first started Crossfit.  There would have been a lot less painful handwashing and screaming from when I tried &amp;#34;New Skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to this is to MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS ARE MOIST!  Use them after the shower or after doing dishes.  Soak your hands in coconut oil or thick lotion for a while.  If you use this while your hands are dry the shaver will take off way too many layers of skin.  When your hands are soft you can press as hard as you want and the razor blade will not cut you deeper than what is needed to take off the callus.  It works perfectly if you follow that.  The rasp you can use dry since that&#x27;s just sort of a quick file for anything that&#x27;s scratching your shorts or your lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this for a fellow Crossfitter after watching him tear open a callus.  Buy it,  your hands will thank you, your workouts won&#x27;t suffer, and your lady/man will greatly appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried about using this myself but it is fantastic! I have nver cut myself using it and every time I use it, it has worked. I normally use it right after taking a showr. You want your feet to feel soft so it is easier to remove the callus.</li>
    <li> This callus shaver is great! As others have said, it does not come with instructions so I fiddled with it for a little bit to make it work. You have to pop out the little triangular white guard to use it. I&#x27;m not sure how this could make anyone bleed as there is a guard to make sure you only shave a very thin amount of dead skin. Perhaps people are using it on areas where the callus is not thick enough? I have had success using it in the follow way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering and towel drying feet, I scrape my heels and the ball area of my foot. I would not suggest using it on the toes or any area where you do not have thick skin. I slide the blade across the callused area with medium pressure and the dead skin is sloughed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not for very small calluses or simply dry skin. For that I would suggest a rasp or foot file. I also can&#x27;t imagine using this on any part of your body except your feet, but for heel and ball calluses it works great!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the worst products I have purchased on Amazon.  To be honest I&#x27;m surprise they are carrying it..  I should have gone with the reviews.  The purchase arrived today..  Just like one of the reviewers I cut myself trying to get the blade in.  It&#x27;s cheap!!  No instructions etc.  I would not recommend... Yes, it&#x27;s going back!</li>
    <li> Got rid of tons of gross calluses on my heels much easier than pumice stones and sandpaper scrubber things. Don&#x27;t overdo it though. While trying to shave a more sensitive callus on the side of my foot by the little toe I accidentally shaved some healthy skin off and it bled. otherwise I was quite happy with the thing</li>
    <li> I bought this because one of my friends recommended it.  I spent 5+ years virtually ignoring my feet, during which time I wore various pairs of sandals / walked around barefoot / wore shoes that didn&#x27;t fit properly / etc.  By the time this came in the mail, my feet were basically encased around the edges in callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Do not use this over carpeting, unless skin-shag-chic is the look you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Do not use on wet feet.  Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Make sure you tilt your wrist as you&#x27;re going over the bumps and crevices of your foot - don&#x27;t just use it as you would a razor for shaving your legs.  Apply even pressure around curves.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Buy some Jergens (unless you already have some, you minx) and rub some on your feet after you&#x27;re done removing your callouses for the day.</li>
    <li> unlike previous reviewer its impossiple to cut yourself.....Ive had problems forever with rouch heels...Ive tried everything including stones, files etc....&lt;br /&gt;2 days of using this and my 10 year problem is gone.....u cant cut yourself unless ur drunk!!! its safe and easy....a great product!!!</li>
    <li> works great! the rasp side is a bit hard to clean.. but an old toothbrush did the trick!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I say this after years, literally, of trying different things for very dry feet. It is safe and easy to use and you can use it on wet or dry feet. Replacement blades are easy to put in. This is ideal for anyone that has callouses and can&#x27;t go for a pedicure every week.&lt;br /&gt;Carrie</li>
    <li> Horrible, come apart as you are using it. Do not waste your money. Total crap.</li>
    <li> These are what the Asians use when giving pedicures. It is by far the best way to remove callouses on the feet.  But beware, you can hurt yourself so be very gentle and go lightly and slowly.  Really you should have someone else do this for you.  Again, beware they are not legal in most salons in the USA anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I tried it first on moistened feet, but didn&#x27;t work very well, skin clogged up the blade. Then tried it completely dry... fantastic! Was super satisfying to see the skin shaving off in thin layers.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it at first but once I knew how to use it, I was very impressed.  No more $350 visits to the podiatrist to shave my corns and calluses.</li>
    <li> At first it sucked but with some manly bending and reshaping of the product where the blade touches the skin it seems to work well. Now If I could just get all the girls to use this before they jump in bed with me ;].</li>
    <li> I crossfit and that builds a lot of callus on the the palms just below the fingers.  To prevent tearing the skin, I need to remove this as often as possible.  A callus shaver is perfect to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model doesn&#x27;t work well on hands, because, the holder for the blade is flat.  It does not allow you to get into the palm well.  To use this tool, you need to bend the holder backwards.  That works great, but now you cannot use the other end of as the plastic guard will not open to cover the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a single callus shaver that is already bent and it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave this one to my wife and it works great for her feet and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Wow. I am afraid of this thing now. It works well, but requires a light skilled touch. The first time I used it, needless to say I cut myself. That happens with razor blades and skin! But works well once I figured it out!</li>
    <li> This works pretty good on my feet when they are dry and have a lot of dead skin. It removed the dead skin and leaves the feet feeling much softer in the problem areas</li>
    <li> Works like a charm,  Once I figured out how to use it!  It just shaves huge pieces of rough skin right off. Careful though, it did cut me on some of the more curvey parts of my feet. I think it just takes a little getting used to.  Once I got the really thick callused places off, I used a battery operated callus remover/smoother to buff them out, put some luscious foot cream on, and VOILA!  My feet were the smoothest and softest they have been since I was a teen.</li>
    <li> Works as described.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem adjusting the blade.</li>
    <li> I like this product, fast shipping,high quality, easy to use and easy to change the blade, I love this product</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter who chose this exact item because it was used on her at a nice salon.  She is very pleased.</li>
    <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING. PERFECT !!!!!</li>
    <li> Holds razor that cuts!!!</li>
    <li> It does its job and really gets rid of the calluses, but it&#x27;s also really easy to cut yourself, so be careful! And replacing the blades is a pain and you have to do it every time you use it.</li>
    <li> I was told because I ordered over a set amount the shipping would be free. It was more than the blades.</li>
    <li> This product will definitely &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; off callus from your heels.  It would be pretty difficult to really cut yourself, unless you were not really paying attention to what you are doing.  The file part is a little cheap, not sturdy enough to handle rough scrubbing.  You have to be careful to let the product dry  completely or it will rust, don&#x27;t leave it in the shower!</li>
    <li> The shaver portion of this I never use so I can&#x27;t comment on that side. However, the shaver blade area itself just SUCKS. It can shave and cut dead skin off that&#x27;s soaked wet, sure, but it gets dull so fast that makes it even more dangerous for you, AND it rusts so fast that you&#x27;ll toss it before you can even reuse it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to go to the doctor&#x27;s to have my feet scrapped.&lt;br /&gt;No more.&lt;br /&gt;I soak my feet for 30 minutes and off comes the excess skin with no pain</li>
    <li> I used to pay extra to get the dead skin removed from my feet at the nail salon. Now I save money and my feet are always smooth because I dont have to wait until I go to the salon. Razor is sharp and product is easy to use. The grater end I hardly use, I guess it could come in handy at some point.</li>
    <li> A real hand saver.  Getting rid of the callous saves shredding the hands which is invaluable for kettlebell training!</li>
    <li> Fell apart when I took THE RASP guard off.  The upper razor came off when I tried to use it, this item is garbage.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this tool because it did not come with a razor. You have to buy the seperately. I kind of wish I would have known that but I was already afraid to use it anyway. Pumice Stone it is for me!!!!!</li>
    <li> wish the button didn&#x27;t fall apart so easily I used it no problem girlfriend broke it during first use she is blonde</li>
    <li> This arrived with virtually no instructions. The ones on the box are worthless. After looking at it and picking at it for over a half hour, I realized there in no blade in it; it did not come with a blade. this is frustrating and worthless.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to afford pedicures and so have done my own. I found this and it is working great on my callouses on my heels and the padding of the balls of my feet and big toe - I&#x27;ve used it when my feet were dry and when they were soft from being wet (but towel dried) - worked great! Did not cut me and got the callouses off :-) Pleased for the price!</li>
    <li> I have tried it in both ways. Wet and dry. I still prefer it dry because I know where to go and not to cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it says. It is easy to use once you understand it and if you remove the blade, just take your time to put it back. Don&#x27;t blame the product if you can&#x27;t do it. It might cut you if you&#x27;re not doing it properly, but it&#x27;s like any other tool, you just need to learn how to do it. Do not use it on good skin, just on those horrible callus! If not, you will cut. Do not try to remove it all in one day, it takes time. I have used it one time per week for a month, 2 months ago and I don&#x27;t think I will need it until later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is use it at night, before going to bed, do all your stuff and then put some nivea cream or other cream and go to bed, do not walk after it so you can have a nice result. And also, if you feel pain the next day, it&#x27;s probably because you went too deep. Just get better the next time!</li>
    <li> Regret having purchased this item</li>
    <li> Nice product. Like the handle</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to get the safety off in order to use the razor for callous remover.  The instruction are so tiny I can&#x27;t read them.  This is a complete waste of money. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was the worst item!  Even after watching &#x27;how to&#x27; YouTube videos, I could not get it to work.  Trust me, don&#x27;t waste your money. I ended up just throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I have very calloused heels and over th last 20 years have spent a lot of money on podiatrists, professional pedicures, and products designed to address the problem. This product is terrific, and did as good a job as the best pedicure I&#x27;ve had which I paid $55. for. Doesn&#x27;t come with any instructions and I had a hard time figuring out how to use the product. I had to read back over some reviews to find out that I should pop out the tiny white plastic piece first! Now i need advice on how to change the blade.......</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my calluses that I get from Crossfit. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how it actually worked, but in the end I figured it out and I was very happy with how safe it is. It doesn&#x27;t trim if there is nothing to trim, otherwise the depth is perfect to shave off the entire callus. Really smooth and easy to use. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This callus shaver works, however it didn&#x27;t come with instructions. It took me a minute to figure it out and be able to use it without coming apart. I wish the blades lasted longer.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money. Cheap, flimsy, razor is dull and useless, grating portion also is useless. I have the same brand but different product that I&#x27;ve been using for going on 2 years and they still worked better than this product. Definitely extremely low quality.</li>
    <li> If you lift a bunch of weights or have calluses on your feet, this thing is the ticket.  The sliding cover broke, but the knife and file are going strong.  The design works to prevent you from cutting too deep and this certainly saves time over sanding or filing them off.</li>
    <li> Terrible design.  Pieces come apart when using for the first time.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Works great! I have used this several times, and it works as advertised. Makes easy work of any callus.</li>
    <li> ***update***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my callus shaver.  It is still working perfectly.  I change the blades after they become dull.  I feel very comfortable with my feet.  I like to care of myself.  Along with a nail clipper, this shaver makes my feet appear very presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this shaver should be adequate for most people, who choose to DIY rather than pay someone for a pedicure.  I also bought [[ASIN:B000BL6JM6 Tweezerman Callus Shaver Replacement Blades]].  The blades are very easy to replace.  After just one use, I already feel very comfortable using it.  With proper care, I hope that this shaver will last me a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to ensure that the skin is soft and ready, I suggest using it only after a hot shower or soaking in very hot water.  The blade easily cut off the dead skin on my callus, in a delicate way- a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;With several slow, deliberate swipes, my old callus(s) were successfully removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rasp works very well.  Although preventing aggressive swipes, the metal rasp is made to slide off the handle.  This allows proper removal of dead skin, which perpetually builds up underneath- after use.  It is obviously not a heavy gauge device, which is especially made for deep rasping.  If you are looking for a device which provides a deep, aggressive rasping without dysfunction, I suggest that you find another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having paid only $9.00 for this shaver, it is very affordable therefore, economical.</li>
    <li> I used this twice in the shower, both the shaver and the rasp, and my feet feel like velvet! Just be careful to dry thoroughly if you use in the shower or tub - I even blowdry inside as much as I can, otherwise it might rust. But it is a good quality item and works great!</li>
    <li> great tool, until you go at a wrong angle or go to deep and slice your foot wide open, but other then that i love it ! works soooo great!</li>
    <li> No more rough feet!  I like using both sids of this and they make my feet super soft.  My only complaint is that the grater side slides off sometimes.</li>
    <li> Love it!! More importantly, my feet love it!</li>
</ol>
