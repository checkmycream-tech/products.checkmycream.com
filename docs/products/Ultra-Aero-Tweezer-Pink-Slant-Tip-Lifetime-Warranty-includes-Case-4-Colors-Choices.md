      <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Are well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>It is still good but not as sharp for the price i paid.</li>
      <li>Try these before you order the higher priced tweezers.</li>
      <li>like I did with my first pair.</li>
      <li>The service &amp; shipping was fast too!</li>
      <li>First purchased from a waxing salon and then found them online.  </li>
      <li>Stick with old tried and true tweezers.</li>
      <li>Having used both Rubis and Tweezerman I find the Denco far superior and half the price</li>
      <li>They get every hair easily and I am seriously thinking about buying more of these.  </li>
      <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>Very prompt service from the seller, received 3 days after placing my order.  </li>
      <li>All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
      <li>If you see a hair that just started to grow these will pull it out first try when other wouldnt have a chance of grabbing it.&lt;br /&gt;The seller &amp;#34;Groom Mate&amp;#34; was fantastic.</li>
      <li>They even come with a little case for safe storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was going to return these tweezer but decided to keep them based on their performance with NORMAL plucking  </li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s a bit early to leave a review, it could take a few weeks and get dull or misaligned but, out of the  box, these are incredible.</li>
      <li>I have bought and thrown away several tweezers but these are the first I am keeping.</li>
      <li>One of the better tweezers that I have had in the past.  </li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>I decided to use my old tweezers as travel tweezers and keep these for every day.  </li>
      <li>They pull those fine and short eyebrow hairs that other tweezers can&#x27;t grasp.  </li>
      <li>Gets all the little thin hairs and nicely designed.  </li>

    <li> These tweezers work great for pulling hair from any angle.  Better than I expected.  It comes with a plastic case for protection.</li>
    <li> About what you get for the same price down the street at your local pharmacy. Didn&#x27;t notice anything special about these. The color was different than what was advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Denco tweezers for years now and wanted a second pair so I bought Anastasia tweezers (at $30) and the Denco is still my favorite!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with these tweezers!  Easy grip and tweezes great!  Plus, they&#x27;re half the cost of the fancy brand!</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW!!! So far, these are the best tweezers I have used. They get every hair, thick, thin, short, long... truly amazing. I know it&#x27;s a bit early to leave a review, it could take a few weeks and get dull or misaligned but, out of the  box, these are incredible. They are lightweight and easy to handle, they don&#x27;t cramp your hand like my anstasia tweezers did. I will definitely stick with these and purchase over and over if the quality  holds up. I didn&#x27;t expect so much at a moderate price-point - it just goes to show you, more expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all of the big brands of tweezers, rubis, tweezerman, anstasia, revlon... these work better! Buy these and see for yourself, you will not be disappointed. The service &amp; shipping was fast too! They even come with a little case for safe storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update if they stop working.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with these Tweezers that I have ordered ano pair..Having used both Rubis and Tweezerman I find the Denco far superior and half the price..Well pleased...They arrived well packed and didnt take long all the way from USA to UK..Well pleased...Many thanks....Excellent seller....</li>
    <li> Horribly sharp and you can hurt yourself.  Difficult to use, going to return this item.  Stick with old tried and true tweezers.</li>
    <li> Very prompt service from the seller, received 3 days after placing my order.  Have used these on my eyebrows...WOW!  They work! Very finely crafted tips, very precise.  Are well worth the price.  I ordered a 2nd pair because I like them so well, just to have on hand, in case something happens to my first pair!  Try these before you order the higher priced tweezers.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers - works really well pulling out very fine slivers.  I only wish you could squeeze just a little bit harder in case the necessity comes up in the future.  Hopefully this will be rigid enough to grab.  No instructions if I can heat this for sterilizing.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very precise, don&#x27;t miss one hair.  HEADS and TAILS above the simple drugstore ones I&#x27;ve always used.  LOVE them.</li>
    <li> I have bought and thrown away several tweezers but these are the first I am keeping. The head is hand ground to a precise fit with zero air gaps. The very tip is perfectly squared and grabs even the tiniest piece of hair that barely protrudes. There is a slight lined texture on the flats of the head which help it hold on. If you see a hair that just started to grow these will pull it out first try when other wouldnt have a chance of grabbing it.&lt;br /&gt;The seller &amp;#34;Groom Mate&amp;#34; was fantastic. I received the tweezers a couple days after ordering, I couldn&#x27;t believe they came so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy crap tweezers to save a few dollars, these are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> One of the better tweezers that I have had in the past.  Very light in weight, flexible and friendly to use.  They also work well in eradicating unwanted hair. The price is better than tweezers at Sephora and lighter to touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other expensive tweezers that were too sharp and actually cut the hairs instead of pulling them out by the root. These Denco tweezers pluck rather than cut the hairs. They work so well that they shorten the time it takes to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Best Tweezer out there.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve bought in a long while. Most tweezers I buy I end up throwing in the trash because they&#x27;re junk. I&#x27;m happy with these and would definitely buy them again. That said, I wish I could find tweezers that are like the ones I had when I was younger. They were very strong and very exact. Again, these are the best I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>
    <li> These are simply great tweezers. They even get those very fine hairs on the first grab. I absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> So happy to find tweezers that can get at stubbly hairs other tweezers can&#x27;t manage. Got these to tide me over while I sent my Tweezerman in for servicing, but they work so well, I haven&#x27;t bothered to ship them out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the reveiw I read and some had written that It is sharp in the begining and after couple of months it gets dull and i agree. It is still good but not as sharp for the price i paid.</li>
    <li> I spent my share of money on tweezers that didn&#x27;t work. These Denco are the best!! The price is also the best. They are great for plucking eyebrows. Be careful not to drop them on a hard surface(tile floor) like I did with my first pair. It will damage the tips. Now I keep them in the little case. Try them. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I got these because something gunky had spilled on my travel tweezers, which weren&#x27;t that great to begin with.  I loved these so much I decided to use my old tweezers as travel tweezers and keep these for every day.  They get every hair easily and I am seriously thinking about buying more of these.  By far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I spercifically purchased these tweezers based on the reviews.  I have a specific need for a tweezer that can grasp even the finest hairs because some of my eyelashes  (which are the finest imaginable) grow behind the regular ones causeing much irritation.&lt;br /&gt;However, as great as these tweezers are, those little lashes needing to be plucked slipped through them.  I was going to return these tweezer but decided to keep them based on their performance with NORMAL plucking  So for those of you who need a great pair of tweezers for regular tweezing these are wonderful!</li>
    <li> These are the bust tweezers I have ever had.  They pull those fine and short eyebrow hairs that other tweezers can&#x27;t grasp.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Forget Tweezerman....These are the best tweezers ever!</li>
    <li> Fab!  Gets all the little thin hairs and nicely designed.  Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> By far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. First purchased from a waxing salon and then found them online.  I buy these for my friends and family and everyone is impressed. You&#x27;ll never buy another brand once you try these. Very happy.</li>
