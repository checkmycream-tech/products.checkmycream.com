<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Such a great balm. Very simple and mildly scented. Doesn&#x27;t interfere with whatever other scents you have going on, whether it&#x27;s shaving soaps, aftershave splash, or cologne. I&#x27;m into traditional shaving and enjoy having a variety of soap and aftershave scents, so it&#x27;s nice having a balm that&#x27;s a bit more neutral. You can also have a nearly scentless post shave if thats what you want; just use this balm either by itself or with an alum block as an astringent. Skin absorbs the balm very quickly, and there&#x27;s no greasy, lotion-y residue left all over your skin. I have other scented balms that I paid a bit extra for, and even they don&#x27;t perform quite as well as Nivea sensitive. I saw that the 4 pack went on sale, and decided that I never want to be without this stuff. Now I&#x27;ll have extra bottles to put in my travel kit, one for my mother&#x27;s house, and 2 backups for $4.50/bottle. Can&#x27;t beat that w/ a sharp stick.</li>
    <li> there is a mild sent, but it dissipates quickly</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Feels good and smells even better</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  Good price.  Soothing After Shave!</li>
    <li> Good deal and need only a little bit. I have very sensitive skin and it irritates very easily from shaving daily. This keeps me happy and the women seem to love it aswell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to the ladies: If you are getting this for your husband or boyfriend don&#x27;t get to jealous if you see other women feeling his face. This is one of the side effects lol</li>
    <li> This post shave balm is great for the winter and for moisturizing in general. I have some trouble with my skin being dry under my beard and getting some beard dandruff, but this product seems to curb that issue. Whether I shave or not, I still put this post shave balm on my face and it seems to be working pretty well.  I&#x27;m not in love with the scent, but that&#x27;s subjective.  I love how it feels when you put it on, however; it feels like you&#x27;re really treating your skin.</li>
    <li> I really like how well this works, I&#x27;ve tried many different post shave creams and usually the good ones are too expensive to keep. I mix it with a moisturizing cream I have, and since both are unscented I added vanilla, just plain vanilla extract. I haven&#x27;t got anything but good comments on the smell, maybe the vanilla cut the peanut butter scent that was talked about in the other post? You could add anything really, scented extracts are great, vanilla and almond would be my pick but there&#x27;s a lot more. If your skin is really sensitive then you might try letting the extract sit out open, even in a window seal to warm up and let the alcohol come out a bit.</li>
    <li> Great price on Amazon for a great product. I&#x27;ve sworn by Nivea ever since I started shaving years ago. There is no better aftershave out there.</li>
    <li> im a redhead and i have super sensitive skin im allergic to paper tape explain that... anyways after i shave i get all red and stuff and this product works well to cut down on irritation</li>
    <li> My son just loves the product.</li>
    <li> Love its smell.. on my husband. .. even better.</li>
    <li> Ordered a package of 4.  I really didn&#x27;t want 4, but it was by far the best value. I have used this balm in the past, and really like it. However, when this arrived, 3 of the boxes were wrapped together with plastic wrap, 1 was in alone, all 4 were in the same box. The 1 in the middle of the 3 was broken and the balm had leaked all over the other boxes. I threw it away instead of trying to return it, as it was very messy.</li>
    <li> Gillette makes a product for half the price that&#x27;s as soothing and with a pleasant odor. This product doesn&#x27;t even come close to meeting my expectations.</li>
    <li> Beyond my expectation</li>
    <li> Wow! I have been using clubman for months but it DOES NOT soothe my skin at all. This balm is amazingðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘</li>
    <li> As advertised, quick shipment, great product. Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> Nice mild fragrance but more importantly it is alcohol-free and is the perfect after shave lotion-tired of screaming ouch with other products!</li>
    <li> I like this after I shave in the morning, because I usually walk the dog right after my shower/shave.  In the winter, all of the cooling aftershaves make my face feel like it is frozen to the core.  This doesn&#x27;t have any such problems.</li>
    <li> little weak for my liking... but i didn&#x27;t notice that its for sensitive skin when I bought it. Will try something different next time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now with very good results after shaving.After a shower in the summer months I&#x27;ll use it on my face if I have been outside for long time. It really helps your skin stay moist.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of post-shave balms.  After-shave liquids tend to have alcohol and can burn initially.  What I like about this product is that it also provides a quick but effective moisturizing for the face.  My skin gets dryer in the winter time so this solves that issue hands down.  Instead of buying separate moisturizer (which all men should do so they don&#x27;t walk out of house with flaking skin) and an after-shave, use this product.  Have been using it for many years.  It has no scent to speak of so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with cologne scent.  They do make other versions that carry a scent and that is fine for those that do not where much cologne.  But you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> Been trying a couple of different lotions to help with my sensitive skin and post-shaving razor rash and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nutrogena products were good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nivea Balm is incredible. Have looked decades for something like this. Shame I have to look at products from overseas. But worth the money and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Nivea.</li>
    <li> This seems to be the exact same product as Proraso Liquid Cream After-Shave 3 for sensitive skin, I own both, and I hate both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, although advertised for sensitive skin, irritates my skin after applied, OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;This product does not sting, rather within 3 minuets of applying it the skin turn red and raw.  Also somehow this lotion opens up previous closed nicks, YUK!</li>
    <li> Been shaving with a blade for years, and tried many types. I have used this one for the last 3 years because it is the very best. Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A good product.  The moisturizing effect does not last very long on my skin.  I usually apply it post an alcohol based splash after shaving.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other post shave balms and this one is the very best.  It has a very pleasing scent that is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great for turning men&#x27;s cologne into aftershave balm. Has no scent. Spray your favorite men&#x27;s cologne on a little of this in your palm.</li>
    <li> Great after shave, has a pretty decently strong odor tbh.</li>
    <li> I have been using this after shave since i was 18...i am currently in my 30&#x27;s - enough said.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t shave often but when I do, I get these red bumps all over my face. But this balm has removed the fear out of shaving. In over 10 shaves now, my skin feels great, doesn&#x27;t bump, and doesn&#x27;t burn after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I know this isn&#x27;t as important, but I also like how it goes on. The lotion isn&#x27;t that thick and really goes into the skin quickly so your skin doesn&#x27;t look oily. Additionally, it has a nice crisp clean smell to it. You can keep putting it on even a couple days after shaving. It keeps your skin moisturized and firm.&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Does what it has to, I was told to use lotion on top of it.  But I guess they didn&#x27;t know it also moisturizes the skin too so I skipped using lotion.  I will be buying more once I&#x27;m out of the four that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell also.</li>
    <li> I just tried some Nivea soothing balm, and I look forward to treating myself to it after every shave now. The scent is not overpowering--very mild and pleasant. On top of that, it feels really nice on your face at the end of a fresh shave.</li>
    <li> Replenishing is better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this after shave lotion for over 10 years. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. It goes on smooth, keeps my face moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. I use it as an everyday face lotion even when I don&#x27;t shave.</li>
    <li> Overall pretty average aftershave was hoping for a little above average still a good backup for your better aftershave invade you run out!</li>
    <li> I like that amazon sells these in packs of 4 for a really nice price.  In stores you would get just 2 for this price. The product itself is nice for my husbands skin, since he has a very sensitive skin it works really well for him.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product for after shaving. It has that &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a man&amp;#34; smell but isn&#x27;t super strong, and it makes your skin feel great just after dragging a jagged blade all over it.</li>
    <li> Shaving without using this afterwards is ill-advised, in my opinion. It reduces the irritation and it feels great. Combined with lotion afterwards, it brings forth the ultimate shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a makeup primer and it is absolutely amazing. It keeps my makeup in place all day and smells amazing. I gave a bottle to my dad and he also likes it for its intended purpose.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I put it on after I shave and it feels nice enough. My girlfriend likes the smell. So it can&#x27;t be too bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked for life. This stuff is exactly as advertised; smooth and soothing without any bite of alcohol.  No rash and no breakouts. Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for in an after-shave lotion!! Soothing with a mild, pleasant scent. The very reasonable price is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read that part so I was pleasantly surprised. Excellent on your face! Nice and soothing for those post hacking sessions on your sensitive face. What more could you ask for? Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using this after my alum bar and my face has never felt better. If you are trying to achieve that baby smooth shave this will help you condition your skin. I recommend applying directly to the shave area and then spreading the remainder to the rest of the face as a general moisturizer...</li>
    <li> Never really bothered with after shave or the like before but got this on a recommendation and so glad i did. My face feels awesome after using it and it&#x27;s become an essential part of my shaving routine.</li>
    <li> Good product, works well to smooth the skin and does not have a crazy scent nor is it overpowering.. Good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Neutrogena products. This balm is MUCH better than the Neutrogena equivalent. As an avid DE shaver, this is the best I&#x27;ve found, and I understand why it&#x27;s amazon&#x27;s #1 after shave seller.</li>
    <li> nice product, smooth, not greasy.</li>
    <li> smells good at least. still get razor burn but this may help.</li>
    <li> Just moisturizing balm with a mild, pleasant fragrance.  Good price, and since I don&#x27;t plan on switching after shaves any time soon, might as well get a 4 pack.</li>
    <li> Works like it says.This is a different formula from the box not marked \\&quot;Active Comfort System\\&quot; and Im glad Nivea got rid of the Parabens,but disappointed they kept that awful,perfume scent.I would give it 5 stars,but the scent takes a star away.Come on,Nivea,Neutrogena,and LO&#x27;Real!We are men,we like to smell LIKE MEN,not a perfume counter.</li>
    <li> My go to Shaving balm!</li>
    <li> Perfect for guys who has a sensitive skin like I do. Try it!</li>
    <li> my husband wasn&#x27;t that impressed and asked me not to buy it again</li>
    <li> I recently got a norleco and found out that my skin was burning after the shave. After reading the reviews I got this and was pleasantly surprised to see how good it is! The amount of balm needed is also very less and I can see how the pack of 4 can last for a long time. The fragrance is also very mild and not at all overwhelming like many  post shave products.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.  It feels awesome after a shave and has the sexiest damn scent any man can wear.  Heck I almost want to put some on even when I don&#x27;t shave, and I own some really nice colognes!!!</li>
    <li> It works, but for a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; product it has a fragrance. My wifes first comment on the fragrance was that is smelled like old lady hand lotion. Ughh... When I buy sensitive products I expect them to be fragrance free. Back to Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Lotion for now, but I was hoping to improve on using a simple moisturizer after shaving.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this balm, but it prevents razor burn and is soothing on the skin.  I didn&#x27;t know what a balm was until I tried this and found out its a cross between lotion and a liquid.  Its very runny, so I use it sparingly.  I am overall satisfied with this product, but would have liked it to be more lotion consistency (but it is labled a balm, so thats my bad)</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this through amazon yet as I was not sure about the product and did not want to commit to 4 bottles.  I bought one locally and I am impressed.  I started wet shaving with a safety razor recently and had some significant razor burn after the first few shaves.  This product quickly soothed the burn and helped to repair my skin.  I have sensitive skin and have not had a single issue.  The scent is mild and clean.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but my girlfriend tells me I smell like peanut butter since I started wearing it.</li>
    <li> good after-shave balm without alcohol or paraben chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goes on easily but getting &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; out of the glass bottle is difficult. makes skin feel nice and moisturized but if applied to heavily it will leave a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;. it&#x27;s labeled as &amp;#34;neutral fragrance&amp;#34; but I would strongly prefer fragrance-free especially when it&#x27;s called for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE AWARE: you are getting FOUR bottles with each order. that&#x27;s enough of that stuff to last you easily 1+ yrs when applied daily</li>
    <li> This balm works, but it feels a little oily on the face.  The container is heavy glass (not sure why) so be careful not to drop in on your sink..</li>
    <li> Leaves a cool and soothing feeling after shaving with no burn what so ever. Also has a light smell that isn&#x27;t too strong, yet it smells great.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing with no sting. But rinse your hands before drying them since the Balm tends to dry yellow on a towel otherwise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this aftershave for about five years now since I started wet shaving. It has become a part of my regimen I cannot live without. I use about a dime sized drop after shaving that is plenty to cover my face with a soothing and moisturizing feel and fresh smelling odor. One bottle lasted me a very long time (about a year). I just ran out this week so decided to buy the 4 pack from Amazon at a great price. This should last me a few years.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily.  I used to buy it a bottle at a time at the local drugstore.  Amazon offers it at a far better price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now. I like it because it is not too greasy and dries up quickly and leaves an nice scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased the cream, badger hair brush, pre-shave and this post-shave balm as a gift for my husband which he truly loves!  He has had to learn to not press as hard with his razor because the pre-shave oil makes his hair stand up great!  Since I bought these together, it is hard to talk about one without talking about the other since the parts are what give him the total experience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an aftershave balm, works as expected. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t burn like the other ones I have used before.</li>
    <li> i used it once. it made my skin burn. contains parabens</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  It really protects and feeds the skin after close shaves.  I shave with a DE razor and was having trouble with both ingrown hairs (very curly beard and nonuniform grain) and razor burn.  Granted I have gotten better and better as I continue to shave with the DE and straight razor, but this balm is great.  No more ingrown hairs or razor burn.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least the last 5 years and its a perfect aftershave balm. Leaves me feeling great.</li>
    <li> I shave my head twice a week and this helps with the irritation. No need to use anything else. Hands down great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and I can shave my head more often. Before I I&#x27;d have to give my head a break every 3-4 weeks due to raiser rash and bumps. The smell is great and I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments from women asking what I&#x27;m wearing for cologne.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a product favored by my husband, he&#x27;s been using it for some time. The balm does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and this was a good price for the amount provided.</li>
    <li> I have been using different types of Nivea post shave balms for more than 10 years, and I have never had any problems with them. Out of all the types of Nivea balms, I like this type the most. I tried different brands as well, but I always returned to Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I use Proraso as a pre-shave cream, and Nivea as after-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm smells nicely and helps to moisturize and soften my skin (it has ingredients that are very good for the skin). Further, it takes care of nicks on my neck nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product because it has really nice price / quality balance (It is made in Germany which is probably the only country now that still cares about quality of its products!!!) and made my shaves much more enjoyable, and my face feels great!!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this because of other reviews he read and the reasonable price. He ran out of a higher-end aftershave balm that he received as a Christmas gift, and his jaw hit the floor when he saw how much it cost to replace, so he went looking for an alternative. He has pretty sensitive skin, and this works wonderfully for him. I also love how it smells on his face!</li>
    <li> I would like this balsam to be more refreshing. When finish my stock I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better out there.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t find any better post shave balm in your pharmacy, trust me I&#x27;ve tried. Unless you go to an old style pharmacy where they sell lots of shaving stuff, Nivea is the best you&#x27;ll get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin, helps moisturize, and resists water fairly well. It will keep your face from breaking out as it adds a layer of protection to your newly shaved skin. I like this stuff, but I wish there were something cheaper. I haven&#x27;t found it for less than around 8 bucks in stores. Amazon&#x27;s got two for $13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this balm, but I don&#x27;t love this after shave and would be willing to try something new if I spotted it in a drug store. It doesn&#x27;t have preservatives or other ingredients that irritate the skin and it is even good as a regular facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this product for his sensitive skin &amp; the costs savings are substantial.  Definitely reccomended, if looking for this type of product.</li>
    <li> i dont know how they can say this is for sensitive skin... i guess since it&#x27;s alcohol free they replaced the alcohol with napalm because when i put this on my face it burned just as bad, if not worse, than any products ive ever used that had alcohol. other than that, once the burning subsides my face feels better than usual,so i&#x27;ll give them a 2nd star for the end result.</li>
    <li> I have 8 white ceramic grenades of this stuff under my bathroom sink. So I guess I must like it. I think I started using it about 15 years ago when I got a free single-use pack with my electric razor. That razor and many others like it have been chucked in the bin, but my Nivea aftershave habit continues. Congratulations Nivea marketers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE FEEL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems to do well enough by slapping a dollop on after every shave. On the occasions where I skip putting it on, I don&#x27;t really see much difference, but the skin does feel less... moisturized? Anyway, as long as I am unnaturally abrading my beard region on a daily basis, I figure some soothing balm ain&#x27;t gonna hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything to me, certainly not like the bodily fluid it so eerily resembles.  The bottom line on this is that my wife likes the smell. Game, set, match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm works great for me. Your mileage may vary, but I certainly encourage you to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have super sensitive skin, anything and everything irritates my face, but not this. Great for after shaving, but a little goes a loooooong way. Don&#x27;t use too much if you don&#x27;t want a sticky face. Just a couple drops on each quadrant of your face, plus a couple drops of water, and spread it around evenly, and you&#x27;re good to go. The scent is nice, but fades away. If you want an all-day scent, this is not it. Great skincare though, keeps the ingrown hairs away.</li>
    <li> Decent price, great product. Doesnt&#x27; leave face feeling greasy, and cools quickly with no burn after a shave. Not a fan of the glass bottle, as its difficult to get the product out in measured amount. It does hit the sweet spot price wise; I&#x27;ve tried the cheaper gillete after shave lotion, and more expensive products, and the nivea is simply the best for cooling and moisturizing the face after a shave.</li>
    <li> I grew up in Germany and NIVEA is a well established brand there. I was happy to see that they brought more and more items across the sea. The &amp;#34;Post Shave Balm&amp;#34; provides your skin with a cool feeling. I would recommend any product from this company.</li>
    <li> Package price was a great deal, hard to turn down. The product is good, better than most I have tried</li>
    <li> my husband has sensitive skin and this product helps prevent razor burn and nicks.  Cuts and bleeding decrease dramatically when he uses this product.  Price is acceptable, method is convenient.  I will keep ordering as long as practical.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving balm on the market. If you wanna keep that baby soft skin, go with Nivea!</li>
    <li> Nothing special here...works as advertised</li>
    <li> Not overpowering - scent-wise.  Clean and goes a long way.  Husband gave up his Mennen&#x27;s Skin Bracer lotion of 40 years for this one, and I like it better, too!</li>
    <li> This aftershave lotion is nice and soothing, provides good moisture, and doesn&#x27;t burn like most of the aftershaves I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty awesome after shave.  Very simliar to Proraso with a slightly stronger scent (which I prefer) and very&lt;br /&gt;similar consistency.  It has a nice, clean masculine scent that would be liked by almost everyone (not off putting at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a light after shave lotion with a great scent that works for all seasons but especially in the warmer months.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but for me, this is the best after shave I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 5 years and will be hard pressed to switch to anything else.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from bad razor burns and itchiness. I purchased this in the hopes that it would alleviate my symptoms after a close shave. After shaving, I take a shower and wash the recently shaved areas with facial wash containing Clean and Clear Advantage facial scrub. After my shower, I apply a generous amount of the Nivea Post Shave Balm and I notice it right away that the razor burns and itchiness will not be a problem. This product also lasts the whole day unlike other products that I have tried where after a few hours after use, the area starts to become irritated. I can truly recommend this product for anyone who has issues with razor burns and skin irritation after shaving.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the greatest stuff ever made for putting on your face after shaving.  Takes maybe a dime-sized amount to spread all over your face, so the bottle lasts quite a while.  Try this stuff and you won&#x27;t seek out anything else.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with my sensitive skin. This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve ever found that actually helps my skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> Rub down your face with nivea post-shave, and you won&#x27;t regret it. The smell isn&#x27;t strong, and the price is reasonable. Buying in bulk saves you money. Just a finger tips worth, is more than enough.</li>
    <li> I shave my head once a week, and this stuff not only soothes - but it moisturizes my bald head too. Been using for a few months. The pack I purchased came with 4 bottles. That should last me about 10 years, no kidding. Lovely scent too.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Not too strong. Does what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad? The shipping. Glass bottle with an air pillow on top of it. No protection from below, where the impact points are. 1 out of 4 bottles broken.  What a mess!!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells amazing. Girlfriend loves the way it smells to and thats always a plus.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this lotion.....says it helps his face from becoming dry and likes the scent.  This is a reorder for us....he&#x27;s hard to please, so this must really be good stuff!</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product. It is basically an after shave moisturizing balm.... But it does not contain alcohol which can sometime cause skin burn. I have completely replaced my alcohol based aftershave balm with this one. It has a great scent and gives the skin a smooth feeling after shaving...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon ships this in a 4 pack and is cheaper to buy as a bundle rather than separate packs in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea already makes some great products and this is just an awesome addition!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and half the price of cvs. Bought 4 with prime</li>
    <li> I use an electric shaver, and my skin tends to be on the dry side after shaving. This balm does the trick, soothing and moisturizing the skin without being gooey or smelly. Pretty subtle overall. That&#x27;s why I ponied up for the 4-pack, which will last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> When I returned to DE wet shaving from an Norelco (30+ years) it became very evident that a soother for my face was going to be necessary. I tried this balm since it was cheap from Amazon&#x27;s warehouse. It saved the day being a wonderful soothing rub with a pleasant smell. I like it so well it is the welcome finish to every shave. A nice modest tingling to start your day..........</li>
    <li> The product is good but it feels kind of unnecessary. You could use some other cheap alternatives without alcohol and have almost similar effect.</li>
    <li> My face gets very irritated and dry from most aftershaves,except for this one. The lack of alcohol, and the increase of anti-inflammatory substances makes this my favorite aftershave so far. It smells great and relieves all the redness from shaving.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave balm - no sting, almost no odor and it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving, but I do it mainly so I can use the Nivea extra soothing balm. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> The only after shave I&#x27;ve found that calms my irritated face after shaving.</li>
    <li> I really have become a fan of Nivea products. I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It smells very good (lightly scented) and really calms the skin. I was learning how to use a safety razor when I started using this, and the many cuts on my face healed painlessly with it. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This balm is perfect for daily use for someone who works in an office. It is inexpensive, soothing when applied, and most importantly for me, has a very slight, almost indetectable pleasant scent. I didn&#x27;t want something that would attract a lot of attention everytime I walked past someone&#x27;s office, or was overpowering, and certainly didn&#x27;t want a scent that would be more appropriate at a nightclub than an office.I&#x27;ll be buying this stuff again.</li>
    <li> My husband now will only use this Nivea Shave Balm, it shard to find in the store sometimes but with subscribe and save it comes regularly. Its a great post shave balm, esp if you shave daily as it really does protect and soothe. Ingredient list is mostly pronounceable in case that matters to you. He uses it along with the sensitive daily moisterizer for men as well and its a complete face skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of after shave for over ten years and it works exactly as intended. Sometimes I will get bumps from shaving but this stuff clears it right up without a feminine aroma or greasy feel.</li>
    <li> best stuff so far for a reasonable price. this balm smells great and is not over powering despite some others reviews. smell is subjective but to say this smells gross or overpowering just aint so.&lt;br /&gt;This has nice moisturizing properties, cools the skin and has a nice, clean scent that does not linger.&lt;br /&gt;The glass bottle is a nice classy touch as well.</li>
    <li> TOO HARD TO DISPENSE, BUT IT HAS AGOOD SCENT</li>
    <li> Does an Amazing job alleviating shaving bumps and ingrown hairs! Also makes the skin very smooth!</li>
    <li> Wanted a less drying after shave than the alcohol based I was using.  This feels much better, but doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance.</li>
    <li> It has a mild fragrance. It works great as a after shave and some times I use it during winter as a mosituriser. You will like this if u want a mild smelling one. I am planning to subscribe for this.</li>
    <li> I only say basic because this stuff is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face absorbs it QUICK, not greasy at all!  Very well hydrated product and it is a mainstay in my shave kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I FORGET to use it, I know it all day.  This stuff is tits.</li>
    <li> The smell on this is nice and subtle.</li>
    <li> Great unobtrusive scent and very soothing.</li>
    <li> I began to shave again after nearly forty years being bearded. This lotion is great. I stopped shaving years ago because of extreme razor rash. Now, my face is smooth with almost no rash after using Nivea. Given time for my face to toughen up and continued use of the Nivea I am anticipating healthy smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Really Good and Super Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this skin creme/balm as I regard it as one of Niveas &#x27;Prime Products&#x27;,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of Niveas Products over the years and most of them were excellent tho sure a few were duds but then who&#x27;s perfect right?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Skin Balm is one of the really great and unsung skin care products of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted I used to love their skin creme until they started making it in Mexico an after that it went down hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skin Balm tho is really first rate as even after a bad shave or a dull blade the Nivea takes the pain and soreness away almost instantaneously,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS: It has a really nice scent that doesn&#x27;t interfere with either cologne or aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True the first couple times I used it I didn&#x27;t think very much of it tho I liked the scent so I used it but after like 3 days seeing the way it made my skin glow.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the way it makes your skin both look and feel is fantastic as after just a weeks use I look years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is really amazing but try a bottle for yourself and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff Said.&lt;br /&gt;IndianaED</li>
    <li> i have really weird sensitive skin to the limit where i realy cant use anything on my face. but this after shave is amazing i can use it doesnt give me break outs and it doesnt have a bad smell to it either i love this thing and i will keep  using it</li>
    <li> Mild smell and helps keep skin moisturized. Especially useful during dry winters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now. It has a pleasant and not overpowering fragrance. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling oily. I use this product after a shower and it has keep my skin from getting dried out after working outside in the sun.</li>
    <li> This is the only after shave my husband would use.  It is light and refreshing, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It is also not alcohol based and doesn&#x27;t sting when he puts it on.  I am glad that Amazon carries it.  I find them at our local Walgreens but the price is quite a bit higher.</li>
    <li> Everything good said about this product is true. Simply the best I&#x27;ve found. As near to perfect as a product can be. Soothing, refreshing. Disapates quickly. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
    <li> I have used this Nivea aftershave balm for over 10 years after dropping my old Gillette Series gel routine. Which felt like a cross between applying a face mask and toothpaste to your freshly shaved skin.  Nivea is a very light lotion with a light fresh fragrance which doesn&#x60;t linger.  Most of all I have been using this as a whole facial moisturizer as my skin can become dry throughout the day in air conditioned rooms and I know it&#x60;s keeping those age telling wrinkles at bay.  Get with it guys soon.  It really works. I&#x60;ve had loads of compliments on my skin&#x60;s appearence and girls have been moisturizing for years.  There&#x60;s something in replenishing that moisture.</li>
    <li> Considering I have skin that turns red if someone barely touches it, shaving can cause some massive razor burn. (Yes, I know having different shaving cream/razors/time of day all matter) but having a lotion that is meant to go on after you shave, to reduce those bumps and red spots and even dryness seemed like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost 10 months of using this product, I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who has been suffering from razor burn or redness. Immediately after I shave, I apply a small amount to neck and face. Within 20 minutes all redness is gone. The entire day my face doesn&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days when I have forgotten my lotion and had to shave, I would see dryness on my neck and razor burn that would never leave. I know this product makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I love his after shave balm.  Makes my skin look lickably awesome.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin after I shave, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It moisturizes without burning.  It&#x27;s also non-scented, which might be a con for some but doesn&#x27;t really affect my opinion of it.  I need something that works with my skin, and this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Nothing else works for my husband who has very sensitive skin...and he just discovered it a yr ago..He insists on having it</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff - as a new wet shaver I do not want to create problems with my facial skin as I learn and adapt to a blade. This goes on somewhat thin and disappears quickly. As the package states it will condition the skin &#x27;over time&#x27; and I think it is. At least it has not created problems when applied over &#x27;raw&#x27; skin and my face feels really nice and healthy. I&#x27;m not a lotion guy but I&#x27;m sold on this product. The bottles are small so don&#x27;t worry that a 3 or 4 bottle lot will go to waste - if you like it as much as I do you&#x27;ll use it up and maybe give one away to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great product, after using it for the last few months and I&#x27;ve found an improvement of my skin, It definitely soothes the skin after your shave.</li>
    <li> This after shave lotion is great. It soothes and leaves your face feeling clean and relaxed, not dry or tight. I would recommend it to anyone. I let my brother-in-law borrom it once when he forgot after shave and he looked at it and said \\&quot;oh, you buy the good stuff.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> While the product performs pretty decently, the scent is a little overpowering.  When I buy products for sensitive skin, I usually look for unscented products as it kind of goes hand in hand in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to shave, but I must and that&#x27;s where this great product comes into play. I don&#x27;t use store bought Shaving Creams, Gels or Foams. And I use a great razor, all in all it amounts to relieving the part I don&#x27;t like, shaving. Its almost like a addiction to shave and use this on my face, neck. I rub it on and working it into my skin in a curricular motion till its almost dried. This assures me that razor burn or discomforts are addressed and corrected. But using all the right products are a controlling factor in toward this benefit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different aftershaves and lotions, and this one definitely ranks among the best to date. Feels cool and soothing after applying and keeps my face feeling soft and smooth for the rest of the day. The scent is really great too. Just subtle enough to smell, but not so strong that you&#x27;d detect it over your cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I&#x27;d definitely consider buying it again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. When my face is really hurting from a rough shave, or just dry in general, this always does the trick.</li>
    <li> The best aftershave balm.  It soothes, cools (not in a menthol-y way), and protects against irritation.  It does have a slightly sweet, flowery scent, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and goes away very quickly.  And it&#x27;s paraben-free.  This is the only stuff I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> Great product cheaper than drugstore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the mail order was great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fourth time I have ordered, each time perfect</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product and hence I thought of buying 1 for my Dad too. He liked the way it moisturizes the skin without drying it as it has no alcohol in it. Dad is glued to this product now...!!!</li>
    <li> Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm, Active Comfort System, 3....&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for Men  Works Great heals the Skin from Shaver Burn.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent post-shave balm. It comes in an attractive white glass bottle and it gives a great soothing feeling and after it drys leaves behind smooth, clean feeling skin with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only potential issue with this that it is not scentless. It has a very mild floral smell to it (Chamomile?). The main reason I purchased the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; version is because typically they&#x27;re fragrance free and I wanted to combine this balm with an alcohol based aftershave splash (Clubman) and get the fragrance of the splash with the moisturizing effects of the balm.</li>
    <li> no other after shave makes my skin feel as good as this one. extremely moisturizing without being greasy. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby who has really sensitive skin. He really likes this as it cools his skin and also prevent post shave inflammation. Great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Provides great protection!  Absorbs completely into the skin and is never greasy!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin and feels cool when applied and seems to take care of the skin after you shave!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. You just need a small dab to soothe your face without any of the stinging of aftershave. It&#x27;s absorbed quickly by the skin and leaves your face feeling smooth. The balm is unscented so you can wear your favorite cologne without piling on scents. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Great smell, nice and gentle to skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for a couple months and I really like it.  I wear a full beard but do have to shave parts of my face to keep a somewhat neat appearance for work.  I use this everyday after the shower/shave and it works great.  It is a bit oily when you first apply it but for my face soaks it up within 10 minutes and leaves it feeling fresh after that.  I typically use around a quarter size amount each morning and that takes care of my face and neck without problems.  I find the scent to be pleasing and on the days I don&#x27;t use cologne (usually the weekends) I can get away with just this for a couple hours while I&#x27;m running errands.</li>
    <li> This product is not for sensitive skin. The fragrance is way too strong. When I arrived at work, after having put it on in the morning, coworkers commented that it would be nice if I used less of it or none at all because they could taste it. I only use a small daub!&lt;br /&gt;Instead, try Clubman, it&#x27;s even American made.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000053L6Y Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This is the best after shave I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;4 pack of 3.3 Fl oz  @ $20.00 is a great price.</li>
    <li> It is nice and light.  Husband loves how soft it feels on the skin.  The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly powerful, either.</li>
    <li> excellent value!!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product for years, best price!</li>
    <li> This product is just awesome in both quality and in price. I don&#x27;t think, I can find a better after-shave than this one that is to my liking. I don&#x27;t think that an after shave must burn or cause irritation even for 1 second -- if it could be avoided. This balm proves that an after-shave can be soothing, non-burning, and effective at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This after shave is much better than Art-of-shaving after shave which from what I recall costs about six times as much when you compare per-ounce cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address the fragrance issue that some people have brought up: My nose has a very strong sense of smell. I find the fragrance generated by this product to be mild as well as pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Nivea balm is not too far from my ideal after-shave. I wish, I could say the same about shaving blades.</li>
    <li> Good. Decent Price. Alcohol Free and hard to find at times. Convenient to put on Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
    <li> My husband can&#x27;t do without an after-shave soothing cream or lotion, and when his favorite was discontinued, we found Nivea. He&#x27;s been using it ever since and loves it.</li>
    <li> this product is perfect if you want a good feeling without all the smell.. I have been using it for a while.. in fact three or four years now.. and for some reason it has become unavailable at the stores I shop... I was very happy to find it here at amazon..</li>
    <li> God I love this stuff.  It just makes every shave end so perfectly.  It lasts for a long time too, because you only need to use a dab of it.  Makes my skin feel awesome and replenished.</li>
    <li> immediate soothing with very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my everyday after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;my skin is sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also great if you shave your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;during winter i need extra moisturizing so i use this:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002UUT450 Nivea For Men Q10 Energy Double Action Balm, 3.3 fl. oz. Bottles (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best for sensitive skin...and does not have alcohol, which, if anyone saw American Psycho, you guys out there shouldn&#x27;t put alcohol on your face...it will dry you up and make you look old! Adding this to my daily routine has kept me smooth, and my face feeling cool after a razor or electric shave. Great stuff, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, like some others.</li>
    <li> Great product. Soothes and hydrates my face after shaving. Would highly recommend to anyone who is interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[a b c]</li>
    <li> Great product, i have sensitive skin so this works perfectly to hydrate without the sting of alcohol and artificial fragrances.</li>
    <li> I had never tried this product before but after reading some reviews I got this in bulk on Amazon.  I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like it and would now own a bunch of bottles I&#x27;d never use.  Now I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;s not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and if shaving is a meal of breakfast this is dessert. I firmly believe using this makes my shave feel better and my next shave better too.  I use it even if I don&#x27;t shave to keep moisturized and smelling oh so fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle goes a long way but I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out this stuff is awesome.  Also on a side note do yourself a favor and look into shaving alternatives from cartridges (IE. Double edged safety razors, lather brushes/mugs, etc.) and get a better shave to go with your new aftershave balm.</li>
    <li> Been using this exclusively for a few years now. I&#x27;ve tried most of the shave products, creams, aftershaves, etc. I shave my head, by the way, so I&#x27;m picky when it comes to shaving.</li>
    <li> Feels great, works great.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful post shave balm. Most of the ingredients are very good for the skin (natural chamomile, tocopherol, panthenol etc) - please note that the formula has changed recently (the new &#x27;Active Comfort System&#x27; products) and they got rid of some harsh chemicals and it is even better presently. This keeps the skin moisturized long after application (all day). The most important thing is it is noncomedogenic and so does not clog pores like many other moisturizers that clog pores in the name of moisturizing. This means better breathability for the skin. One thing I would like to stress on is that this does have a fragrance and it is the most wonderful mild scent amongst many aftershaves that I have tried. I first got a whiff of this blissful fragrance on a trip to Copenhagen long ago when the &#x27;Sensitive&#x27; line of Nivea products were not freely available everywhere. The first time I used their Sensitive Shave Gel I was mesmerized by the wonderful mild lingering fragrance. It is one of my favorite fragrance of all times. I am not a lay man when it comes to fragrances - I own more than 50 designer colognes from the best design houses (Armani, Gucci, Christian Dior, Burberry, Dunhill and scores more). Taste in fragrances is subjective - try yourself first. The fragrance in this is not at all strong enough to be inappropriate for being in a &#x27;Sensitive&#x27; product - however if you prefer absolutely zero fragrance in your after shave AND if you have a sensitive nose (unlike some reviewers here who are not able to perceive its very distinct scent) then this may not be the right product for you. For those who want a very healthy, soothing and protective balm and do not mind a mild, masculine scent in it - this is THE balm</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it everyday as a aftershave as I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Kills skin irritation from shaving which is what I bought it for. Feels cool when putting it on and doesn&#x27;t make me break out in acne like using a regular skin (hand) lotion. Also, barely has a scent and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cologne. I&#x27;ve almost never had a bad experience with Nivea.</li>
    <li> This seems to moisturize pretty well and the scent is barely noticeable.  The only complaint I have is that it makes my face break out in pimples.  I am 25 and normally have a very clear face, but something about this balm doesn&#x27;t agree with me.  To me, the moisturizing isn&#x27;t worth having to shave around, or just slice off zits the next day.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  So i have done a lot of searching for after shave balm that calms my skin after each shave, helps with ingrown hairs and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  Nivea&#x27;s post shave balm ticks off all the boxes.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best men&#x27;s lotion on the market.  I have been using it for years and love it.  It only has a light fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my after shave which I need.  It goes on very smoothly, not greasy, and dries quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting after shaving like most lotions.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out or irritate it at all.  Nivea makes really good products.  I used to hate getting razor burn and rash after I shaved and this lotion keeps my neck from hurting or getting irritated.  I&#x27;m not an expert on creams by a long shot but I just know that this works really, really well on my face and neck.  My face really likes it and it gives me a nice healthy look.  I use it all year long and it is great after my shower every day or to keep my face from getting dry in the cold winter air.  In the summer after a day in the sun this cream is a welcome layer on my face to keep it from getting too dry.  You will agree and love this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found many products that work as well.  I have tried many different products but the Nivea&#x27;s Sensitive Post Shave has come through again and again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in my shaving routine for so many 10 years. It is refreshing, leaves the skin moisturized, and helps with nicks and irritation. I&#x27;ve tried the $40 top of the line brands and the regular over the counter. This has become my go to. Affordable, and lasts long. I apply some in my palm with the fingers, rub, and massage onto face. I also use a moisturizer afterwards. The only thing is the sensitive formula could do a better bob with small cuts. the regular is better for that. I dab some alcohol or medicated powder on first for those once in a blue moon cuts since I switched to a safety razor (or that mach 3 cartridge which is way past its prime, - you know what I&#x27;m talking about fellas, squeeze the $$ out of those.  but those are usually cuts that even after shave splash can&#x27;t fully cure. only a alum bloc. happy shaving folks</li>
    <li> I have been using htis product for years and its perfect for my needs. Will buy again once this runs out.</li>
    <li> I use this after I shave with an electric razor.  It soothes the skin, it&#x27;s not too thick or runny, comes in a glass bottle, and smells great.</li>
    <li> Started using this product and have no complaints. Good product and good results. When I use these up I will order again.</li>
    <li> Love this after shave balm. Very light and I use this as a lotion as well and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over two years now.</li>
    <li> I recently started using a straight razor, and this balm is very soothing after having &amp;#34;moidarized&amp;#34; my face.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product because I have dry skin, and was told by my dermatologist to get this product. The use of the word POST is deceiving. It IS an after shave, and it is a world class one at that ! I could never bring myself to pay city prices for this item until, yet again Amazon came along to help my pocket book and sell a 5 star product. Arrived in a large box, and the product was in yet another very stylish inner box. I just wanted the cream!! It brings down that stinging in seconds. I bought 4 boxes, and saved at least $10.00. Thank you yet again Amazon. Excellent service, great product, and avoidable for me, and I have enough to last me quite a while.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I have been using this product now for almost 15 years so it&#x27;s time they got their props from me.  I use it on my face and head whenever shaving.  The few times I have tried other brands I have always come back.  Refreshing feeling, amazing smell, no burn.  What more can you ask for out of an aftershave?</li>
    <li> All the previous rave reviews not withstanding, this stuff is just barely ok for anyone not wishing strong fragrance. While the fragrance aint, say, Aqua Velva, neither is it neutral, or light or short lasting (as some reviews stated). But, of course, smell is all personal taste so . . . order with caution. On the plus side, The bottle is lot easier to use than those horrible, small squeeze boxes of Nivea &amp;#34;Extreme Comfort&amp;#34; after shave balm, which is superior in all ways--when you can get it out of the little squeeze box. So I guess  this stuff will do in a compromise, although I gave away to my teenagers the three bottles that come in a pack. Might make them smell better, too.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel nice and moisturized post-shave. I generally have sensitive skin, but this product works just fine for it and is a decent balm for preventing razor burn.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for a strong smelling after shave.  This product has a mild scent that is pleasant.  Feels good on your face after a close shave.  It is not an alcohol based product that stings (or some might say tingles).  Wife likes the scent.  I&#x27;d have no problem recommending it.</li>
    <li> So much the better.  I thought it was a little pricey for aftershave lotion, but when it arrived, there were four of them.  My husband loves this stuff, so we&#x27;re quite pleased.</li>
    <li> Bought this as stocking stuffer and my boys and they like it.</li>
    <li> best i ever tried, makes your face baby soft</li>
    <li> An inexpensive shaving balm, it&#x27;s the one I use everyday. Has little scent so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your after shave. Has a nice soothing effect. Feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff a lot. I think I prefer the thicker, Nivea Energy lotion, but this stuff is pretty good too, and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Nice product, pleasant mild scent, I found that one 3.3 oz. bottle lasted me somewhere between 2 to 3 months, that&#x27;s with applying some to the neck area as well , apply sparingly , and this product should last for quite sometime</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product but sadly it isn&#x27;t right for my skin. First of all, it is designed for sensitive skin but it irritated my skin horribly. Within 30 min of application, my skin started itching and breaking out. And secondly, the scent is not to my liking. It has a feminine lotion smell to it similar to something my mother puts on her face (Oil of Olay).</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell if this was moisturizing or worked well as a post shave balm because it smells like absolute crap.&lt;br /&gt;I had to wash it off in less than an hour (I hoped the smell would fade but it didn&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you hate that typical cologne smell like I do, DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> I think this is an great product.  It eases the burn (when that happens - not so with my Astras) and allows me to shave on consecutive days without problems.  I&#x27;m rather curious about Amazon&#x27;s investigation into their inventory, shipping (doubt this), or the way its described (5/25/13).  The thing to watch is price - my local store had this @ $6/3.3 bottle, so I bought a four pack from amazon for about $5/each.  I ordered some recently and the pack was only $12!  Talk about variation.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years for post-shave irritation prevention and moisturizing. No alcohol means less irritation and it leaves the skin feeling soft and a pleasant mild smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not get the burn with typical aftershaves due to not having alcohol. Plus the other ingredients help sooth razor burn if you happen to get it and helps prevent razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It cools and calms my face after shaving without any burning or stinging.  The smell is very nice, not super strong like some stuff, does not make my eyes water like some other products.</li>
    <li> Feels great! I bought both this and the Proraso, and I find myself using this one more. Smells a bit nicer and feels better.</li>
    <li> The best scent-free and soothing after shave that I have found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or it&#x27;s just all marketing.  I used to just use moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband and he has been very happy using this balm!</li>
    <li> Winter time is such a pain in the... face... ya know?! Everything dries out, and shaving becomes a sensitive experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife works in the cosmetics area of a major retail store and, this past winter, she asked her colleagues for their opinion on products that might be able to help reduce my post-shaving sensitivity and redness, and this Nivea product was clearly the one most recommended. She got it... and I can tell you that it works, and that it works right away -- immediately on application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is not thick or sticky at all, it is light and thin so a little bit goes a very long way. My skin just seems to soak it right in, and there is no greasy feeling or residue. It has a light fragrance that is not as strong as a fragranced after shave or cologne and is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added unexpected benefit is that this does a great job on other dry skin areas; this time of the year, my hands sometimes get a little dry and sensitive, as can the front of my shins. A little application of this lotion on the sensitive area and I get 100% immediate relief. Just tried it on a spot &#x27;for the heck of it&#x27; one day and am really glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a light lotion to give you post-shaving relief or to help treat a dry sensitive skin area, based on my experience of the last 18 months I totally recommend this lotion. Try it, you will be happy with the result.</li>
    <li> Good stuff guys and not very expensive here.</li>
    <li> Different formula? I had an old bottle and it worked great. I ran out and bought a new bottle and it makes my face and neck red and burns terribly. I wonder if the formula changed since i bought my first bottle. It used to fix razor burn instantly- now it makes things twice as bad</li>
    <li> I love this balm.  It has a light and refreshing scent.  It doesn&#x27;t linger and won&#x27;t clash with aftershave or fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soothed, especially in winter (dry weather) or after a shave that caused some razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;It dries and absorbs on my skin and does not feel oily or greasy - your experience my differ.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it after washing my face at night to nourish my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for a lot of product.  I apply it generously after shaving and each container seems to last me a pretty long time. It&#x27;s prevented razor bumps and soothes the skin.  I definitely like it.  I don&#x27;t think it works as well as the version with alcohol, but I like that they made this version for people that have a reaction/can&#x27;t use the other version.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion. I use everytime after I shave. The smell is annoying but it&#x27;s not very strong and seems to fade away after a while. But if you are sensitive about the smell, this might not work out well for you.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and as advertised.  Really like this post shave balm, soothes my skin and it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong scent. I like it!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few shave balms, and this is my favorite.  It&#x27;s light, has a very mild clean scent, and spreads on evenly.  I sport a gotee, and I even run it through my facial hair as my wife has reported it makes it softer, it helps straighten out some of those way ward hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomend, and added this to my subscribe and Save list.</li>
    <li> I mean really, who sells a pack of four, and even worse, who buys a $20 item thinking it is only one (oops).  But its okay, you know, for face stuff. Buy it, or better yet, try to get a free sample.... the stuff lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I use this daily as my aftershave lotion. Works great to keep my skin from drying out. I shave my head too so I probably use more than most people but I still find that a bottle lasts a long time. Buy it- you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.  Refreshes and have received multiple complements from women about the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice, not too strong at all.</li>
    <li> The first time was after finding Nivea Energizing Hydro gel, which is discontinued.........and this is the second time.&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago I bought 5 bottles of Nivea Energizing Hydro gel from a daily deal site and Nivea stop making it, which broke my heart. They now sell $23.99 for 2.5 oz bottle, I refuse to pay that much. I just shaved and use the Post Shave Balm for the first time and wow. No overbearing sent or stunning like gillette fusion. I will be stocking up before this is also discontinued.</li>
    <li> Have been buying for many years, just never got to reviewing.  I have sensitive skin, hate shaving, but this balm completely takes care of discomfort.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. I am in the military and shave every day and have tried many different products to alleviate razor burn from shaving against the grain and this seems to help. My face feels better and seems moisturized. The smell is pleasant and not overpowering.  The price is outstanding for what you receive. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best I have used for post shaving. I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday so when I don&#x27;t shave, I use it right when I get out of the shower. Awesome lotion!</li>
    <li> works great after a shave, odorless so doesn&#x27;t compete with your cologne.</li>
    <li> Great at fighting razor rash.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this and would buy again. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all and keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Best after shave cream that I have ever used.  It does a great job.</li>
    <li> I love it and use it every day!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an aftershave that was designed to be refreshing and easy on the skin.  After a bit of digging online, I settled on this one, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  The ingredients list is relatively short, and the result is nice.  Most other reviews will say that this is soothing/refreshing/moisturizing, etc... And they&#x27;re right.  Some might complain that the fragrance might not last so long.  Those are correct too.  The fragrance is nice, but yeah, it doesn&#x27;t last.  I personally didn&#x27;t buy it for how it smells (I use designer aftershaves for special occasions.) The upside, it won&#x27;t clash with cologne, if you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a soothing aftershave.</li>
    <li> No more razor burn!  This stuff is like magic. Soothes the fire, just like the commercials say. You will love it</li>
    <li> 3/3/15. Excellent face balm.  I have used it for years and still enjoy the effects.  Buying from amazon.com is the least expensive and most convenient means to get the product.</li>
    <li> HUBBY LOVES THIS POST SHAVE BALM.</li>
    <li> feel smooth,the smell is just right</li>
