### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Love it!!!!</li>
      <li>Brings out my eye color perfectly</li>
      <li>What a beautiful color!</li>
      <li>The mascara does not come out all gloopy and the brush does a great job separating the lashes and getting color on even the smallest ones.  </li>
      <li>I was nervous but happy with it  </li>
      <li>Great mascara.  </li>
      <li>June 2014 was almost a year ago but mascara is good for about three years unopened.</li>
      <li>Amazing, amazing mascara!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about this mascara, best one I&#x27;ve found, great product!</li>
      <li>I love the sparkle, it&#x27;s not overbearing or tweenish at all!</li>
      <li>Covergirl normally doesn&#x27;t impress me but this stuff is great!</li>
      <li>Love this mascara and the applicator.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this color mascara for many years and will continue to do so.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite and</li>
      <li>I hope it continues being available on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Anyway, glad to have found it here.  </li>
      <li>but still ok.</li>
      <li>Have had many compliments since I started using it.</li>
      <li>Color was fine, staying power was fine.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t intend to order waterproof, so I wasn&#x27;t thrilled, but those who want mascara that will last for days may love this product.</li>
      <li>On top of the horrid spider lashes it gave me, the color really did not enhance anything(maybe because the way it made my lashes stick together?).</li>
      <li>Most people don&#x27;t notice the color of the mascara - only 1 person that was touching up my makeup for a film shoot noticed the color - so they don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s the mascara that&#x27;s making your eyes look brighter.  </li>
      <li>It actually looks pretty good with my eyes.</li>
      <li>And it looks beautiful with  my green eyes!</li>
      <li>My favorite daily mascara.  </li>
      <li>The red/black color is fun, but still professional worthy.</li>
      <li>And I do believe that I can find a bit of shimmer if I really try, like rubbing the wand on a tissue and holding it in direct light.</li>
      <li>The color is nice, almost dark auburn.</li>
      <li>(ahem, Almay Intense iColor glitter bomb.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not so stark black, perfect for this strawberry blonde.</li>
      <li>I love this color for green eyes.  </li>
      <li>Seems dry right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>This one is the first one in a LONG time that will stay on even as I rub my itchy allergy eyes.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and eyes and this formula doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all.</li>
      <li>I go for a more natural look on a daily basis, but this mascara gives an extra pop to my green eyes.  </li>
      <li>As far as price goes this product is very affordable compared to other brands of mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube of Black Ruby that I got today (sold by Amazon, not a third-party vendor) was very fresh--manufactured in June 2014.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not great for making huge lashes, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for in this mascara.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes and this is the only mascara which doesn&#x27;t irritate them. I also work twelve hour night shifts and this is the only mascara which carries me through my shift without flaking or giving me raccoon eyes! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a heck of a time finding a mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake off of my eyelashes. This one is the first one in a LONG time that will stay on even as I rub my itchy allergy eyes. The color is nice, almost dark auburn. Not so stark black, perfect for this strawberry blonde. And I do believe that I can find a bit of shimmer if I really try, like rubbing the wand on a tissue and holding it in direct light. But I&#x27;ve never noticed any glitter or sparkles on my face (ahem, Almay Intense iColor glitter bomb.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube of Black Ruby that I got today (sold by Amazon, not a third-party vendor) was very fresh--manufactured in June 2014. There is a tiny, etched alphanumeric code on the tube that can be plugged into &amp;#34;checkcosmetic dot net&amp;#34; to find the manufacturing date. June 2014 was almost a year ago but mascara is good for about three years unopened. For comparison, another tube of mascara I got from Amazon (third party) recently was manufactured in 2009. 2009!</li>
    <li> This clumps so bad. I&#x27;ve never used a Mascara that clumps like this one before. On top of the horrid spider lashes it gave me, the color really did not enhance anything(maybe because the way it made my lashes stick together?). it might work for some, but it did not work for me.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this color for green eyes.  I can&#x27;t find it in the store anywhere.  It&#x27;s my favorite and really the only one I have found that I like, that also isn&#x27;t too heavy like some.  I hope it continues being available on Amazon!</li>
    <li> it does the job, i didnt think it was a different color than my other mascaras.</li>
    <li> It is very thin and several applications had to be applied.  Color was fine, staying power was fine.</li>
    <li> I prefer the one for Hazel eyes, but increasingly hard to locate.  As far as price goes this product is very affordable compared to other brands of mascara.</li>
    <li> Not sure why Cover Girl quit making this product.  It seemed like it sold well, as my local Rite Aid had difficulty keeping the colors my daughter &amp; I wanted in stock.  Anyway, glad to have found it here.  Compare prices, as they seem to vary a lot among the vendors.</li>
    <li> Brings out my eye color perfectly</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this mascara, best one I&#x27;ve found, great product!</li>
    <li> This mascara is SO waterproof that you almost need a sandblaster to remove it.  My usual mascara remover, mineral oil, night cream just didn&#x27;t touch it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t intend to order waterproof, so I wasn&#x27;t thrilled, but those who want mascara that will last for days may love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I like the basic traditional brush and slim strainght tube. It clumps less than any mascara I have ever used before. The red/black color is fun, but still professional worthy. I don&#x27;t know if it really helps to bring out my green eyes, but I do have a strange shade of green eyes (half olive, half teal).</li>
    <li> Worst mascara i&#x27;ve ever used. Flakes ALL over the place and not water resistant whatsoever! Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> Great mascara.  Enhances my hazel eyes. Have had many compliments since I started using it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only waterproof mascaras that doesn&#x27;t flake too much, doesn&#x27;t clump, stays on and isn&#x27;t expensive.  I only use lash lenthening mascaras because the lash volumizing mascaras always seem to clump.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this as long as they sell it.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara and the applicator.  The mascara does not come out all gloopy and the brush does a great job separating the lashes and getting color on even the smallest ones.  Sad that I think it has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> A little dry- but still ok.</li>
    <li> I must say, I really like the Ruby Black color for my Green eyes. I have gotten compliments and a phone number in two days and I&#x27;ve worn it for only 2 days! CoverGirl you did it again! Fabulistic product!!</li>
    <li> My favorite daily mascara.  I go for a more natural look on a daily basis, but this mascara gives an extra pop to my green eyes.  Most people don&#x27;t notice the color of the mascara - only 1 person that was touching up my makeup for a film shoot noticed the color - so they don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s the mascara that&#x27;s making your eyes look brighter.  It&#x27;s not great for making huge lashes, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for in this mascara.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this color mascara for many years and will continue to do so.  I have sensitive skin and eyes and this formula doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all.</li>
    <li> Amazing, amazing mascara! No clumping, no flaking, no running! And it looks beautiful with  my green eyes! I love the sparkle, it&#x27;s not overbearing or tweenish at all! Covergirl normally doesn&#x27;t impress me but this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Color was hardly noticeable and did not do much for eyelashes. Don&#x27;t recommend if you&#x27;re looking for color to accentuate eyes.</li>
    <li> What a beautiful color!</li>
    <li> I have blue eyes but still bought three of them to give the other two away as gifts. It actually looks pretty good with my eyes. I was nervous but happy with it  my sister likes it and goes very well with her green eyes!</li>
    <li> Seems dry right out of the box.  Don&#x27;t lije.</li>
