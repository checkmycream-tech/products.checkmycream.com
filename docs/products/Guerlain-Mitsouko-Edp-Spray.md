      <li>perfect for winter.</li>

      <li>Very warm.</li>
      <li>After reading lots of wonderful ( and some not so wonderful ) reviews about this perfume I decided I must have it.&lt;br /&gt;I was so lucky that received the 2015 batch with the divine reformulation made by Thierry Wasser.&lt;br /&gt;Mitsouko</li>

      <li>And the bottle is gorgeous - like a piece of art.</li>
      <li>Light scent that is very pleasant.</li>
      <li>I have had the same experience with another legendary perfume that I had heard wonderful things about.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been happily working my way through my bottle of Mitsouko and returned to this site once more.</li>
      <li>Very sexy and yet not over powering.</li>
      <li>If you love Shalimar then this one is for you also!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this perfume here!</li>
      <li>I just love this perfume!</li>
      <li>Oh, this is elegant and evocative!</li>
      <li>ok i hope!</li>
      <li>that green-fruity tinge underneath is amazing, nothing like anything coming out now.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own scent.  </li>
      <li>So, 3 stars for the nice bottle.</li>
      <li>It is a scent that will stir in others their own passions and longings.</li>
      <li>My husband had purchased this for me many years ago because he loved the scent.  </li>
      <li>The love of my life loved it.</li>
      <li>, I felt it was a close-to-the-body scent, but many people told me, hours after application, how good I smelled.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sure potent, which in this case wasn&#x27;t a good thing.</li>
      <li>is by far the best perfume</li>
      <li>Mitsouko has kind of a musky scent to it which I love.  </li>
      <li>So strong I couldn&#x27;t give it away!</li>
      <li>I found when I did it this way that I tolerated the scent much better.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on this perfume every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I could guess from this parfum what an authentic chypre might be like but this chemistry set in a bottle was not that.</li>
      <li>Mitsouko has been a cult favorite since the 1930s.</li>
      <li>This used to be my favorite perfume</li>
      <li>Still fragrant, elegant, sweet-smelling.</li>
      <li>A lovely, spicy scent.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was before the delivery promise date...very pleased 😀</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite winter fragrance, my signature if you like.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE MITSOUKO and will buy it again.</li>
      <li>you  will love this</li>
      <li>Quietly elegant, but with staying power.</li>
      <li>Been wearing this cologne since I am 16...just love the scent.</li>
      <li>I guess you either love it or you don&#x27;t, but if you don&#x27;t, there is no way you ever will.</li>
      <li>favorite  </li>
      <li>This came on time and was authentic.  </li>
      <li>so I could tell it was authentic.  </li>
      <li>If this is reformulated in any way, I sure cannot tell.  </li>
      <li>Mitsouko is for the woman who is comfortable in her own skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely and so singular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>I am GLAD of the reformulation, because now it no longer uses animal products as Guerlain has gone &amp;#34;cruelty free&amp;#34; according to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not an &amp;#34;old woman&amp;#34; yet, but I started wearing more floral scents for a number of years.  </li>
      <li>and I received so many compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>I think I heard a rumor that this was Jean Harlow&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
      <li>Mitsouko was created by Jacques Guerlain in 1919 originally for men and contains bergamot, jasmine, rose, peach, oak moss, pepper, cinnamon, and vetiver.</li>
      <li>Mitsouko starts with beautiful bergamot and rose; the rose surrenders to peach fairly quickly and peach begins its long march to the finish (and is joined by pepper and vetiver which butch up the fruit).</li>
      <li>and I found it too strong for my taste.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s so strong</li>
      <li>Mitsouko is timeless, been around for a century now, and still going strong.  </li>
      <li>Like pages and pages of fine literature, or the scent equivalent of orchestral sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the difference in price are huge.</li>
      <li>SMELLS FABULOUS........</li>
      <li>There are websites that allow you to order samples before buying, for precisely this reason.  </li>
      <li>Not so &amp;#34;Mitsouko&amp;#34;--it is comfortable year-round.  </li>
      <li>Some reviews say to wear it at night--I say wear it daily as it&#x27;s a joy.</li>
      <li>Fantastic masterpiece from the house of Guerlain that emanates intelligence and mystique with a hint of melancholy.</li>
      <li>I then decided to lightly mist my clothing and then wait a day or two.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me of Annick Goutal&#x27;s Grand Amour at first but very quickly it becomes</li>
      <li>When I was a child, my mother had a great friend who was an elderly White Russian aristocrat, a woman of great elegance and taste who&#x27;d lived in China, and had a house full of remarkable, rich furniture and impossibly deep wool carpets.</li>
      <li>It is rich and spicy.  </li>
      <li>When trying the first spray, I thought it was the most horrendous smell ever,</li>
      <li>but it has changed a lot from the original one.  </li>
      <li>this lovely perfume has sandlewood, cinnamon, and other warm, exotic spices.</li>
      <li>Not over bearing or flowery...just right!</li>
      <li>It lost that classic elegant fragrance, instead it smelled like a cheap foundation powder.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Mitsouko is rare among fragrances. It is powerful and alluring. It is complex and provocative. It is mysterious. It is sensual. If it works with your chemistry you will find that it is initially spicy with scents of cinnamon, clove, and shades of ginger. As it matures on the skin, it transforms into a more subtle floral fragrance almost like hydrangeas in bloom . This is a statement fragrance. It will not go unrecognized. Mitsouko is for the woman who is comfortable in her own skin. Recommended to be used at night only, probably to entice one&#x27;s lover, daytime use is highly recommended. It is a scent that will stir in others their own passions and longings. Just a touch to your pressure points. You will otherwise overwhelm those who surround you.</li>
    <li> This is a must-have for anyone who appreciates fine fragrance and is willing to step far out and away from the crowd and into the exotic. This fragrance has long been considered a masterpiece by those who study, create, and collect perfumes and colognes. It is not a fragrance for everyone. It is not for every day, or every occasion. The scent is complex and difficult to describe, but the overall sense is warmth without sweetness, powdery but not light or soft, with an undercurrent of dangerous sensuality. There is a peppery overtone, a distant peach note, and a dusky &#x27;walk in the late season garden&#x27; aura to the fragrance. Use very, very sparingly; a misting only.  It goes on strongly and stays for a very long time. This is not for work or social occasions, this is for intimacy. Going to spend a rainy afternoon in bed with a lover? This is what to wear. You&#x27;ll be remembered for it.</li>
    <li> A little floral, a little fruit, a little spice -- a timeless feminine fragrance. Classic without being old-fashioned, it&#x27;s sensual yet ladylike.</li>
    <li> With many vintage and new fragrances in my collection, i thought Mitsouko should definitely be included. Once i ordered the bottle i couldn&#x27;t wait to smell this &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34;of a perfume that everyone is raving about.Four days later it arrived, and my husband decided to open it before i even came home from work. He texted me joking that this perfume is a &amp;#34;divorce inducer&amp;#34;. Once i came home and sprayed it on my wrist i felt like someone slapped me in the face. Maybe my nose isn&#x27;t as refined as other noses writing the reviews, but this was the most disgusting and horrendous scent i ever had on me. I am European and we are introduced to perfume pretty much the same day we are born. I&#x27;ve had hundreds and i purchase a lot of minis and full size bottles every month, but i&#x27;ve never had one that gave me prickly numbing feeling along my jaw bones. Even though it smelled quite obnoxious, i decided to give it a try. Hour later it changed, but for the worse. At this point both my husband and my daughter moved away from me, begging me to go wash it off. Even after i scrubbed my wrist with dawn detergent you could clearly smell Mitsouko a mile away. I took a shower, and following day Mitsouko was clearly present on my left wrist. It&#x27;s sure potent, which in this case wasn&#x27;t a good thing. This is not even an &amp;#34;Old Lady&amp;#34; scent, i simply have no words to describe it. I guess you either love it or you don&#x27;t, but if you don&#x27;t, there is no way you ever will. I ended up returning it, which was a first for me, as i never ever had an excuse valid enough to return a perfume. I asked my husband what would he do if this was the only perfume i had and used, and he said he would move out :) Please note that i have nothing against vintage perfumes, and those that today we refer to as &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; scents. I have Opium and vintage Panthere de Cartier which i occasionally use, but Mitsouko was nothing but offensive. I think i might be little traumatized.</li>
    <li> This is a very old fragrance form many years ago, I think the 1930&#x27;s but it is a classic. I get so many compliments on this perfume every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will not regret it.  Although it is classic , it does not smell like your gramma&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> One little known fact is Jean Harlow&#x27;s favourite fragrance was the vintage scent Mitsouko by Guerlain. She is seen using this scent in her movie Dinner at Eight. Jean&#x27;s second husband Paul Bern was said to have doused himself in the fragrance shortly before committing suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally created for men and then later marketed for women and used by Jean Harlow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpt from Now Smell This Contributor: Kevin S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Guerlain Mitsouko (pour homme). Mitsouko was created by Jacques Guerlain in 1919 originally for men and contains bergamot, jasmine, rose, peach, oak moss, pepper, cinnamon, and vetiver. Mitsouko starts with beautiful bergamot and rose; the rose surrenders to peach fairly quickly and peach begins its long march to the finish (and is joined by pepper and vetiver which butch up the fruit). On my skin, Mitsouko&#x27;s overall aroma is of ripe peaches (cushioned on oak moss in a nest of vetiver roots) sprinkled liberally with freshly ground black pepper.&lt;br /&gt;One can easily find fruit accords in modern men&#x27;s fragrances; I especially like green mango, grapefruit, fig, raspberry and plum. Peach is no more \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; than those fruit aromas, and I certainly prefer peach to the apple, pineapple, kiwi and melon accords I&#x27;ve encountered recently in men&#x27;s colognes.&lt;br /&gt;As I wore Mitsouko, I felt it was a close-to-the-body scent, but many people told me, hours after application, how good I smelled. Among Mitsouko&#x27;s admirers was a macho straight man who wears ozone/marine colognes almost exclusively. He said: \\&quot;Kevin, I might get a bottle of that, what is it?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Mitsouko Eau de Parfum lasts on my skin for over twelve hours and even after half a day of wear, the fragrance remains fresh smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Mitsouko Eau de Toilette is similar to the Eau de Parfum but it is brighter, more glaring; I prefer the Eau de Parfum concentration.&lt;br /&gt;Mitsouko has recently been reformulated by Edouard Fl&amp;eacute;chier to remove (much-maligned) oak moss from the composition. I have not smelled the reformulated Mitsouko yet. If you want to experience the \\&quot;old\\&quot; Mitsouko, you&#x27;d better buy it sooner than later. When I finally told Mr. Ozone-Marine the perfume he liked on me was Mitsouko from Guerlain and it was marketed to women, he said: \\&quot;No way! I won&#x27;t wear it but I might get my wife a bottle.\\&quot; &#x27;formulated Mitsouko yet. If you want to experience the \\&quot;old\\&quot; Mitsouko, you&#x27;d better buy it sooner than later. When I finally told Mr. Ozone-Marine the perfume he liked on me was Mitsouko from Guerlain and it was marketed to women, he said: \\&quot;No way! I won&#x27;t wear it but I might get my wife a bottle.\\&quot; &#x27;</li>
    <li> Mitsouko has kind of a musky scent to it which I love.  It keeps it scent all day long.  I just love this perfume!</li>
    <li> If you love Shalimar then this one is for you also! No need to go to Paris or Bloomngldales to get a Geurlain product! Wonderful scent, wonderful service!</li>
    <li> SMELLS FABULOUS........people stop me to ask what I am wearing,  plus this parfum last all day ..WILL DEFITELY purchase ago when  out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this perfume here! Mitsouko has been a cult favorite since the 1930s. It was actually movie star Jean Harlow&#x27;s favorite perfume. It has a very warm, spicy scent. When you wear it you feel like you&#x27;re ready to attend a Hollywood premiere. I have been wearing Chanel No. 5 as my signature scent for years but once I smelled Mitsouko I switched. Now this is the only perfume I wear. And the bottle is gorgeous - like a piece of art.</li>
    <li> Ordered as a gift for my wife. Very hard to find in stores. She had been looking for a long time and was very surprised that I was able to get it. Light scent that is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Mitsouko for over 40 years and never cease to get compliments on its scent.  There are new perfumes coming on the market daily and none have the allure of Mitsouko.  I only wish I could afford to use the perfume in addition to the EDP.  Some reviews say to wear it at night--I say wear it daily as it&#x27;s a joy.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it.  Great price</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother, she said this is the real parfum,she cannot find it anywhere . Be careful, there are 4 kinds of parfum: Parfum, eau de parfum,  eau de toillet and eau de cologne, the difference in price are huge.</li>
    <li> Seems slightly off, but that just may be due to re formulations as ingredients have to meet requirements over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every once in a while I will get an off note that make my eyes want to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a strong perfume, use sparingly, not a modern one meant to be used up ASAP so you can go drop another $80 on your next bottle.</li>
    <li> When I was a child, my mother had a great friend who was an elderly White Russian aristocrat, a woman of great elegance and taste who&#x27;d lived in China, and had a house full of remarkable, rich furniture and impossibly deep wool carpets. This was her signature scent. I&#x27;d always been in thrall of it, but it seemed too complex for my palate - I tended as a younger woman toward simpler scents, white florals etc. But the memory of this perfume, with its difficult to define allure and multiple levels of scent, stayed with me and finally, FINALLY, I broke down and tried it. I hated it on me when I used it the first time - but tried it again the next day. By day three I was hooked. It starts out almost green, like a broken twig, but the drydown has multiple layers and the whole scent changes interestingly through the day. Very difficult for me to identify the individual notes, but if you like a complex, very adult scent that whispers of the Orient, this is one to try.</li>
    <li> This came on time and was authentic.  I have a miniature so I could tell it was authentic.  I was so happy because I had gotten 2 fake bottles on eBay and sent them back and got refunds.  I was loosing hope but yesterday the beautiful bottle with the great smelling Mitsouko arrived.  I am so happy and relieved.</li>
    <li> Great product....wonderful scent.  I would recommend Mitsouko to anyone who loves the scent and doesn&#x27;t want to pay department store prices....</li>
    <li> I did some research and read lots of reviews on this Parfum.  When trying the first spray, I thought it was the most horrendous smell ever, something of a mix between a funeral home and urine.  I was patient, wore it for an entire day, hoping the scent would improve and that I would grow to love it, and still, I couldn&#x27;t get over this powerful looming oder.  Just in case it was just me, I asked my husband what he thought, and he said, &amp;#34;well, if you like it&amp;#34;.  I think this might be man code for &amp;#34;YUCK&amp;#34;.  I also wore it out shopping and exploring for a whole day, never received a positive comment.  Tried this again another day, to no avail.  Both times wearing this, I had a headache and felt almost nauseous.  Please, try this on first before purchasing!</li>
    <li> I think I heard a rumor that this was Jean Harlow&#x27;s favorite.  I am intrigued by the 1920&#x27;s and that time era&#x27;s fascination with the far east and the mid-east, as well as its height of decadence before the economic collapse.  This was said to be a classic perfume of that time, and created by the high perfume house of Guerlain of France.  Though the perfume was reformulated a bit - it&#x27;s supposed to smell the same.  I am GLAD of the reformulation, because now it no longer uses animal products as Guerlain has gone &amp;#34;cruelty free&amp;#34; according to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the perfume disappointed me - smelled like old lady hairspray!  But then it unfolded.  After a couple of hours, it&#x27;s wonderful.  A combination of warm scented candle wax, a hint of peach fruit and blossom, and a slight Oriental chypre.  Also, many complex layers of scent.  Like pages and pages of fine literature, or the scent equivalent of orchestral sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this perfume is far more complex and rich than Chanel No. 5.  It&#x27;s a true Perfume House masterpiece.  It&#x27;s nice to know that a little goes a long way.  It has awesome staying power and &amp;#34;freshens&amp;#34; up nicely after bathing, with light base notes left behind. But beware, immediately the next day thereafter, it smells like you had a wild night of... well, use your imagination.</li>
    <li> I had bought this perfume years ago and have loved it ever since.  However, the one that I bought recently did not have the same fragrance like before.  It lost that classic elegant fragrance, instead it smelled like a cheap foundation powder.  This used to be my favorite perfume but it has changed a lot from the original one.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Mitsouko has been my perfume for years, it is very distinctive and people often tell me they associate it with me. guerlain perfumes are never on sale or discounted. This was an exception and i got two bottles. I am set for the next  5 years.</li>
    <li> Too heavy!  It doesn&#x27;t smell good and it&#x27;s so heavy people will ask you to leave the room.</li>
    <li> So strong I couldn&#x27;t give it away!</li>
    <li> Mitsouko by Guerlain 75ml 2.5oz EDP Spray  was recommended to me by a friend and I am happy that I could try this product .</li>
    <li> After doing a test on Guerlain&#x27;s website which enables you to find out which fragrance suits you the best, Mitsouko turned out to be the site&#x27;s recommendation. Since it is not available where I live (Uruguay), I bought it online. No chance to test it before.  I had read wonderful reviews, and I dreamt of it...until I got it. Undoubtedly, a fragrance is a personal thing. Mitsouko has all the charme, the mystique and the history that appeals on me, but it doesn&#x27;t work on me!&lt;br /&gt;When sprayed, it smells horribly, something urine-like, sweet , persistent and absolutely displeasing.  I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, because I had no other option to test it, but  I won&#x27;t buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> After reading lots of wonderful ( and some not so wonderful ) reviews about this perfume I decided I must have it.&lt;br /&gt;I was so lucky that received the 2015 batch with the divine reformulation made by Thierry Wasser.&lt;br /&gt;Mitsouko is by far the best perfume ever.&lt;br /&gt;Its opening notes are citric and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; with an incredible and alluring charm and elegance. It later changes to something more peachy still citric and flowery. These notes begin changing to something woody and spicy but suddenly from time to time all notes come back mixing top, middle and base notes so perfectly that you can&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;Transaction with Amazon was perfect.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MITSOUKO and will buy it again. Its the best.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom who first tried it in france.  She loved it BC it was not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The newer formulation has a lot less of the oakmoss and jasmine than the vintage, but it&#x27;s still so elegant. I don&#x27;t get the peaches and florals in the drydown as much, but the dusty-spicy-powdery feel with that green-fruity tinge underneath is amazing, nothing like anything coming out now.</li>
    <li> Was a great experience. The perfume came on time and I was so happy as it was a gift for a birthday! Thanks, I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing price for a wonderful fragrance.  My wife loves it and she used to pay near $100 for this exact product and she is getting this from me for one of her holiday gifts.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite winter fragrance, my signature if you like.  Mitsouko is timeless, been around for a century now, and still going strong.  If this is reformulated in any way, I sure cannot tell.  It&#x27;s exactly the same bottle and the same fragrance I wore back in the 60&#x27;s.  Can&#x27;t do without my Mitsouko!</li>
    <li> My  Moms  favorite  so I had  too have it in her memory!&lt;br /&gt; Fragrance  exudes elegance  and  gatsby-asque attitude..  do  you  go  to the Opera..  you  will love this</li>
    <li> My Mom  is 97 years old and as long as I can remember, she wears it.  I am happy if she is happy!</li>
    <li> this lovely perfume has sandlewood, cinnamon, and other warm, exotic spices. perfect for winter. and doesn&#x27;t make you smell like an old lady!</li>
    <li> stinks period, i dont care about the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; status</li>
    <li> Love this old world fragrance!</li>
    <li> Fantastic masterpiece from the house of Guerlain that emanates intelligence and mystique with a hint of melancholy. It seemed quite striking at first, but after a few wears, it has quickly grown into a favorite!</li>
    <li> Oh, this is elegant and evocative! It&#x27;s an old favorite, rediscovered.  It&#x27;s a curious thing: I saw a review by someone who thought it was &amp;#34;an old lady&#x27;s&amp;#34; fragrance.  I&#x27;m not quite sure what scent that reviewer might be thinking of -- but it is clearly a negative connotation.  Nothing is farther from my mind when I wear this perfume! It&#x27;s so exotic and mysterious -- and sensual! It&#x27;s quite unlike any other perfume that I am aware of.  There is a &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; aspect to it, but it&#x27;s certainly not of the canned talcum variety! I think of green, mossy scents, mixed with spices and aromatic woods.  I first wore this scent as a young woman and I received so many compliments on it.  I&#x27;m not an &amp;#34;old woman&amp;#34; yet, but I started wearing more floral scents for a number of years.  I &amp;#34;rediscovered&amp;#34; Mitsouko and wondered what was I thinking to stop making this my signature fragrance.  It&#x27;s lovely and so singular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been happily working my way through my bottle of Mitsouko and returned to this site once more. I saw a particularly negative comment which I will ignore as it was so pejorative; however, there are several other negative reviews that are worth taking seriously. The only way I can reconcile (and explain)  my genuinely positive experience with this fragrance and those clearly sincere negative reviews is that perfume reacts very differently on each of us.  That reality must be factored in when considering any fragrance purchase.  There are websites that allow you to order samples before buying, for precisely this reason.  It makes sense to put the scent  directly on your skin and see how it reacts to your own body chemistry over time. I am sorry for those who purchased this fragrance and were disappointed with how it smelled to them. I know it is upsetting, especially when buying high-end perfumes.  I have had the same experience with another legendary perfume that I had heard wonderful things about.  I ordered it online and enthusiastically spritzed it on me when it arrived.  Frankly, I reeked to high heaven.  I couldn&#x27;t bear the scent and had to wash it off.  I wasted my money but I learned my lesson.

    <li> Love it!!!!! For ever!!!! This mituko is the #1&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think with out mituko sorry love it ok i hope!</li>
    <li> My husband had purchased this for me many years ago because he loved the scent.  He tells me now that it smells slightly different.  Not bad. Just different .</li>
    <li> one of my all time favorites. delicious and sexy</li>
    <li> this is a perfume for those with upgraded sense for smell&lt;br /&gt;those who would like Hermes 24 Farbourg, would probably like Mitsouko.</li>
    <li> I could guess from this parfum what an authentic chypre might be like but this chemistry set in a bottle was not that.</li>
    <li> Unlike almost all modern scents, this doesn&#x27;t shout its entrance.  A wine descriptor applied here would be &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  Some perfumes must be relegated to a specific season.  Not so &amp;#34;Mitsouko&amp;#34;--it is comfortable year-round.  Quietly elegant, but with staying power.</li>
    <li> This perfume was purchased for a friend on their request. Quite frankly, it stinks. It is definitely made for an older person, like in their 80s or 90s.  The person who received this perfume loves it and wears it religiously.</li>
    <li> This Guerlain fragrance stands out from the crowd in a distinct way. It is sharp and acrid when I first spray it.  Oddly enough, it smells like cat pee and moss on the initial spray.  The first time I smelled it I was disappointed.  I sprayed it in the normal pulse points and I found it too strong for my taste.  It cost a fortune and I didn&#x27;t want to waste it.  I then decided to lightly mist my clothing and then wait a day or two.  It actually took a few days before it mellowed. It made my wardrobe smell soft and a little powdery. The unusualness still stands out but it is subtle and less intrusive.  I don&#x27;t think it blends well with my body chemistry so that maybe the problem.  I also tried spraying it on my ankles and behind the knees.  I found when I did it this way that I tolerated the scent much better. It took awhile but I gradually started picking up the peach note that is often mentioned in fragrance reviews.  This a winter fragrance and should not be sprayed liberally but with care.  This fragrance can be offensive to some.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this cologne since I am 16...just love the scent. Not over bearing or flowery...just right!</li>
    <li> it was a pleasant treat to find my scent ,  it is very hard to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;the box was perfect and a great gift</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this one 10 stars.  A lovely, spicy scent.  Working on second bottle and will buy another when this is gone.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I anticipated.  Delivery was before the delivery promise date...very pleased 😀</li>
    <li> I always loved Mitsouko by Guerlain. The very last one I have used was bought from Sak&#x27;s Fifth Ave from years ago. I bought 2 bottles and kept them in the Fridge( I read somewhere that perfume last longer when stored in the fridge). I finished the last one few years ago and when I saw this one from Amazon with a great price, I went for it. I always trusted Amazon. I don&#x27;t know what happened with the new version, it&#x27;s so strong&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s almost offensive. Two little spritz in the winter time should give a subtle scent...but not this one. This will knock you out! If you are faint hearted, this is not the one for you! I want to give 5 stars for the way AMAZON handled the refund/return but just don&#x27;t want it to be mistaken as rating for Mitsouko. So, 3 stars for the nice bottle.</li>
    <li> Guerlain is undoubtedly one of the greatest perfume houses in the world.  However, some EU regs in the 80&#x27;s caused them to change the ingredients and formulations of some of their older perfumes, including this one.  This doesn&#x27;t smell the same as vintage Mitsouko.  I re-sold it.</li>
    <li> Mitsouko has stood the test of time. Still fragrant, elegant, sweet-smelling. The love of my life loved it. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It is rich and spicy.  Reminds me of Annick Goutal&#x27;s Grand Amour at first but very quickly it becomes it&#x27;s own scent.  Very sexy and yet not over powering.</li>
    <li> A heavy, mature (not in a bad way) fragrance. Very warm. I find it best for winter wear. Lots of lasting power and projection. With my chemistry it&#x27;s not at all fruity. Lots of earthy oakmoss, cinnamon, vetiver and bergamot. Mitsouko will not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. To me it&#x27;s a very cozy scent, like a down comforter &amp; hot herbal tea. Recommended for those 25+</li>
