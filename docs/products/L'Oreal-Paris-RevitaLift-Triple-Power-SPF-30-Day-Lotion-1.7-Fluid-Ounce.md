      <li>Honestly, I think using a good moisturizer and sunscreen are your best bet to prevent wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.</li>

      <li>I have noticed a good difference in my skin using it.</li>
      <li>In addition, it smells good</li>
      <li>great paraben free 30 spf suncreen and beauty lotion!</li>
      <li>I buy this primarily because it is very effective as a sun screen that moisturizes my skin and prevents my fair skin from burning.  </li>
      <li>Great product for the price, goes on smooth not greasy.</li>
      <li>Feel nice, not oily.</li>
      <li>Nice pump delivery system.</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have an anti aging product that you can also use as a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>This is a really nice and creamy sun block.</li>
      <li>And the added SPF is an extremely nice addition.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a nice, not-too-heavy moisturizer, which I appreciate with my acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>The Oil of Olay product had already given visible results  and the naso-labial folds were significantly reduced, with which I was happy.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong fragrance, and i could not use it.</li>
      <li>It would be a good lotion if they make it fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I loved every thing about it form the light feel to the noticeable results.</li>
      <li>I recommend it strongly to all ladies!</li>
      <li>Nice and light for day use</li>
      <li>That and drinking lots of water, eating healthy, and not smoking.</li>
      <li>The prospect of something being better than what I was already using sold me.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Touching my face a time after applying it feels as if someone has put wax on my face.</li>
      <li>I have used it for years and the product has many stages to choose from.</li>
      <li>It is a nice all around day time moisturizer that works well and will go well under makeup because it does smooth out your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pump bottle, and you have to twist the top to make it work.</li>
      <li>and then my foundation and this cream does not pill up like many sunscreens do.  </li>
      <li>As something that is advertised to revitalize, um, not so sure.</li>
      <li>I love a well-designed and well-engineered container.</li>
      <li>: I called to make sure it&#x27;s not just spf</li>
      <li>I was pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more when I run</li>
      <li>Then I looked at the ingredients and saw mostly chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps I will put it aside for now and try it again in the winter when I need more moisture.</li>
      <li>While it does this Revitalift has better products that do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best facial moisturizer with</li>
      <li>still using this product and am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>The lotion was light and smooth to the touch with a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The main purpose as stated on the container is \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; and it does a great job.</li>
      <li>There is no greasy feel and it works great under my normal makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves skin smooth and satiny, is very light and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>I think the scent is light and appealing and did not think it was overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like fragrance of any kind, but the fragrance of this isn&#x27;t too offensive, and, fortunately, dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>Good bye high price department store and hello to a thicker wallet.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Revitalift Triple Power Lotion with SPF 30 is a pretty nice product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or fine lines yet, but they are lurking around,ready to pounce out at any time.</li>
      <li>Going on it feels fine.</li>
      <li>It feels fine applied to the skin</li>
      <li>It did work well on the fine lines and felt smooth, not greasy when applied.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a great moisturizing sunscreen that applies smoothly and evenly I would definitely recommend L&#x27;OREAL REVITALIFT DAY LOTION.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a great moisturizing sunscreen that applies smoothly and evenly I would definitely recommend</li>
      <li>Great facial cream.</li>
      <li>This is the second moisturizer that I&#x27;ve experienced this with</li>
      <li>It was light</li>
      <li>It would get five stars from me if it were fragrance free.</li>
      <li>But, it did leave a smooth, powdery feel to my skin after application, and the smell is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not greasy, but glides on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I dot the lotion along my &#x27;E&#x27; and use my fingertips to smooth upward and across.</li>
      <li>This is a great daily moisturizer that also contains spf 30 sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like it because it goes on smooth</li>
      <li>and I think it works great as a daily moisturizer which also has spf 30 sunscreen in it.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the feeling my skin receives with this</li>
      <li>Smooth and light.  </li>
      <li>and I found it to be a great daily moisturizer with the added protection of an spf30 sunscreen</li>
      <li>Maybe with longer use of this product and using their whole skin regimen it may work better, but I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
      <li>Now I feel comfortable in using it more consistently, both because it&#x27;s lighter and understanding now that it&#x27;s also a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am 51 years old and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but began to notice very fine wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
      <li>The lotion itself was fine, not too thick or greasy, perfect to wear under makeup.</li>
      <li>It would leave you feeling clean with a bit of sparkle, all the while protecting my face.  </li>
      <li>Many lotion bottles squirt out too much.</li>
      <li>My husband used some when we went kayaking and was surprised at how well it worked as an effective sun skreen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently moved to a hotter climate and even though my brown skin provides a layer of protection from the sun, I&#x27;ve been advised to utilize a good sunscreen as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on light, not greasy and seems to be absorbed quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Came quickly and I like that this product has SPF</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Katie Couric show. They had several products they said were new &amp; great. After buying this I realized it was just a commercial for a sponser of the show. They made it seem like they had done research on it, but obviously not. Bottom line is if you read the bottle all it says is sunscreen. No firming, no wrinkle remover, no age spot reducer, just sunscreen. It also starting breaking out my face. Not worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Great facial cream. I have noticed a good difference in my skin using it.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful, but then I tried it. It might work but it&#x27;s perfumed so I can&#x27;t use it. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal SPF30 Revitalift Power Lotion for over two weeks now, and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised and really like it.  I have tried a lot of moisturizers over the years and as I get older my skin&#x27;s needs have changed. It blended in well and my skin was noticeably smoother with no rough dry spots, it also was not greasy feeling at all.  It also did not clog my pores and cause breakouts.  It was light and I can even go to the gym and sweat without it turning standing out on my skin (some with sun screen had that affect on me). and having to not use an additional sunscreen is wonderful. As for firming, I really do not have wrinkles (yeah!) but I believe it has helping with my skins elasticity.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice and creamy sun block. I was really surprised when I put it on my face because usually when a product has such a strong smell, even though it smells really good, it was gentle on my skin instead of harsh. It did make it feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does, however, take awhile to do what it says it is supposed to do so you will have to keep using it if you want to improve your skin. It is a nice all around day time moisturizer that works well and will go well under makeup because it does smooth out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pump bottle, and you have to twist the top to make it work. You have to pump quite a bit to get out the amount you need to spread on your face. This many not seem important, but if you are like me and spread it on your neck as well as the section above your cleavage, it takes a minute to get the right amount out of the bottle to spread on your face. It&#x27;s good skin care, but it did seem a little hyped. I would still recommend this product especially if you have mature skin because in spite of the fragrance, it really is gentle.</li>
    <li> The thing about anti-aging products is that it takes a lot of time to determine if they work. Unless you already have wrinkles, then I guess if the are reduced, the product is working. The lotion itself was fine, not too thick or greasy, perfect to wear under makeup. But after about a week, I remembered why I don&#x27;t use these products anymore. They cause me to break out. Honestly, I think using a good moisturizer and sunscreen are your best bet to prevent wrinkles and keep your skin healthy. That and drinking lots of water, eating healthy, and not smoking. You will probably only notice small changes if you have wrinkles and spots. Major changes will really only happen with prescription strength products. Save your money.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I am fifty-two years old and it really makes my skin smooth. I also like the sunscreen that is in it.</li>
    <li> I do like this lotion. The SPF is enough that I can be out for hours with no sunburn. In addition, it smells good and I can dispense a tiny amount at a time. Many lotion bottles squirt out too much. I don&#x27;t know if my skin necessarily is improving but it&#x27;s a nice, not-too-heavy moisturizer, which I appreciate with my acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> I started using this product instead of a discontinued high SPF cream by another company.  I really like the scent and the consistency of this one, and the fact that it has an SPF of 30. Recommended for people who want to provide high protection to their facial skin on a regular and year-round basis.</li>
    <li> This is called a Day Lotion but I am not sure what that means.  It claims a 30 SPF which becomes less as it quickly soaks into the skin.  On the back it indicates the purpose is a sunscreen so, while the front says Revitalift triple power Day lotion, the specific purpose is NOT as a lotion.  It feels fine applied to the skin but I think I would not feel comfortable without adding a second layer of sun protection because of the rapid manner in which this is absorbed by the skin.  Truly depends on your expectations whether you want to purchase this.</li>
    <li> I think L&#x27;OREAL&#x27;S REVITALIFT TRIPLE POWER DAY LOTION WITH SPF 30 is really a good combo moisturizer and sunscreen in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other sunscreens, the POWER DAY LOTION goes on lightly and has a very thin and easily absorbed texture (almost like water), so it goes on quickly, easily and with little fuss. My skin sucks it up and there&#x27;s no whitish looking ashen color that usually happens with SPF over 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that another reviewer didn&#x27;t like the scent, but I found that the scent was light and didn&#x27;t bother me and usually certain scents will. Also, it didn&#x27;t linger and it didn&#x27;t smell like that bad plastic smell that&#x27;s usually found in sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to whether or not it helps with wrinkles, I&#x27;d say that only the finest of lines will get smoothed out and those are usually caused by superficial dryness on the surface of the skin. I don&#x27;t have deep set wrinkles yet, and I&#x27;ve got combination oily/dry skin that occasionally breaks out still, but I&#x27;ve started to notice wrinkles forming on my forehead and in between my eyebrows, which comes not only with age but because of grimacing when I&#x27;m working out, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m starting to try various moisturizers that help with fine lines. I&#x27;ve only been using the product daily for about 3 1/2 weeks and it usually takes up to 6-8 weeks of continued use for any results to actually show up with products like this -- or so they claim. However, if you have deep set wrinkles that are caused by the way your skin crinkles (around the eyes, lips, or forehead) no beauty cream is going to help with that, no matter how much money you spend. Creams can help retard or slow the wrinkles/crinkles from getting deeper faster, but eventually you&#x27;ll get those lines that won&#x27;t go away unless you get Botox or some other filler injections from a dermatologist (I&#x27;ll need that in about 5-10 years if I don&#x27;t want the lines).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong because I find nothing wrong with age lines and wrinkles, but I think I&#x27;m getting the type that makes one look like they&#x27;re angry all the time, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a great moisturizing sunscreen that applies smoothly and evenly I would definitely recommend L&#x27;OREAL REVITALIFT DAY LOTION.think I&#x27;m getting the type that makes one look like they&#x27;re angry all the time, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a great moisturizing sunscreen that applies smoothly and evenly I would definitely recommend L&#x27;OREAL REVITALIFT DAY LOTION.</li>
    <li> Well, I can&#x27;t say folks tell me I look like I&#x27;ve had a face lift. I can say when I put this stuff on my skin tingles and I do notice it works as a sun screen, which is what it says it does.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Revitalift Triple Power Lotion with SPF 30 is a pretty nice product.  It goes on and is absorbed into the skin easily, without feeling heavy or greasy.  I don&#x27;t know how the long term effects will be, but as a moisturizer, it leaves my skin feeling soft.  I wear it under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent if pretty light, but I would prefer no scent at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks, and have noticed some slight improvement. The lines above my upper lip are less noticeable, my nasolabial folds are less prominent, and my skin feels softer. I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to it, or experienced any adverse side-effects. I don&#x27;t like fragrance of any kind, but the fragrance of this isn&#x27;t too offensive, and, fortunately, dissipates quickly. Many of these types of products are only SPF 15, so I&#x27;m pleased that this is SPF 30, and as a sunscreen it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad these rejuvenation products are so expensive because they work for some people, and not for others, so everyone&#x27;s in the same boat spending a lot of money trying to find something that works for them. I recommend this product because it works for me, and hopefully it will for you, but if not, I hope you find something that does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/28/2014&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this product and am pleased with the results. The lines on my neck are much less prominent. It would get five stars from me if it were fragrance free.</li>
    <li> The best facial moisturizer with a high SPF..☀️ great buy for the 💰</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a teenager (not by a long shot), but I still break out occasionally when I use certain products. This is one of those products. Within a week of using the lotion, my face and neck developed hard, white \\&quot;cystic\\&quot; type pimples. I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to assess it&#x27;s wrinkle-fighting abilities, I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness. But, it did leave a smooth, powdery feel to my skin after application, and the smell is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive or acne prone skin, you may want to avoid this product.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this cream and it works wonderfully under my foundation.  I use this cream then a BB cream over it and then my foundation and this cream does not pill up like many sunscreens do.  I will be back for more of this cream and love that it is spf 30 which is higher than most facial moisturizers are.</li>
    <li> First let me say that prior to purchasing this product I had been using the Oil of Olay Regenerist line. I loved every thing about it form the light feel to the noticeable results. I was looking for a complete package: day, night and cleansing. I saw the RevitaLift products and had read great reviews. The prospect of something being better than what I was already using sold me. This WAS NOT it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 51 years old and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but began to notice very fine wrinkles on my forehead. Also the nasal-labial fold that make you look like a puppet. The Oil of Olay product had already given visible results  and the naso-labial folds were significantly reduced, with which I was happy. Since using the Loreal Day and Night &#x27;Lotions;, the folds have begun to reappear. Not only are they not improving further, this product is not even maintaining the previous progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about the word &#x27;lotion&#x27;. When I hear the word lotion, I visualize something that will absorb into the skin. After applying this in the morning (I rarely wear makeup), by afternoon and evening I could signal planes to land from the reflection on my face. It does not feel greasy and the look is almost that of a glossy plastic overlay.  Think the see through masks at a masquerade party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night &#x27;lotion&#x27; is not much better. I dot the lotion along my &#x27;E&#x27; and use my fingertips to smooth upward and across. Going on it feels fine. Touching my face a time after applying it feels as if someone has put wax on my face. It is thick. It is soft but feels nothing like soft &#x27;skin&#x27;. (think of those soft rubber gripper things). Looking in the mirror 30 minutes after application, again I see skin that looks more like a Mardi Gras Mask than soft, supple skin. The youthful glow does not reflect sunlight people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have stated that after using this product, they experienced break outs. I was a little skeptical at first until I started getting these tiny little painful what I hope are pimples on my cheeks.  This is definitely not non-comedogenic. I apply this after washing, exfoliating and using toner but it still manages to clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a natural born cheapskate but this product has convinced me that I can afford to toss 30 bucks between this day and night lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil of Olay! Take me back! Please!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product. It did work well on the fine lines and felt smooth, not greasy when applied. The lotion was light and smooth to the touch with a light, pleasant fragrance. I will be buying more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was if you were working outside-the directions recommend you apply it every 4 hours and I wasn&#x27;t about to carry the bottle around with me.</li>
    <li> Got L&#x27;Oreal SPF 30 Revitalift for my wife to try since she likes these kinds of products. I asked her for her comments.  She said the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use moisturizer with sunscreen, so I was happy to try the Loreal Revitalift.  I found it a little heavier than the product I usually use, but not as heavy as some I have tried.  I was surprised to read the directions and see that its purpose is a sunscreen as I was also looking for the triple power lifting action the name implied.  I have not seen any results in that area although it may be too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that my skin seems a bit greasier than usual with this product.  Although I am over 50, in the summer I am pretty oily and therefore try to use a moisturizer that is light.  Perhaps I will put it aside for now and try it again in the winter when I need more moisture.</li>
    <li> This is a great daily moisturizer that also contains spf 30 sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer goes on clean without a noticeable white residue or smell.&lt;br /&gt;There is no greasy feeling or shiny skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion also has Avobenzone which is an excellent sunscreen for blocking UVA rays which cause wrinkles and skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not waterproof so don&#x27;t count on it to protect when you get wet or go swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim is that it can \\&quot;REPAIR WRINKLES\\&quot; which it doesn&#x27;t seem to do. I&#x27;ve been using it for a about 15 days and no measurable result yet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure there is any over the counter lotion which can truly repair wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up below! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very suitable for women over the age of forty. My facial wrinkles definitely decreased. I recommend it strongly to all ladies!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream...a lot less expensive than some of more boutique brands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have an anti aging product that you can also use as a sunscreen.  Sometimes my face breaks out from suntan lotions, but it does not with this product.  It is not greasy, but glides on smoothly.  I like the applicator also, better than a messy tube.  I do not notice any offending odor with this also.</li>
    <li> Like others have noted I too didn&#x27;t realize this was also a sunscreen. It&#x27;s always great to hear those protective ingredients are in a day-cream. I was already a user of L&#x27;Oreals&#x27;s Revitalift Complete but had found it a little thick. I prefer the thinness of the Triple Power Lotion. Only time will tell how much damage it actually appears to repair - but in the meantime it feels less greasy despite having pretty much the same ingredients with only a slight variation in percentages. That must be what makes it feel lighter on my skin. Now I feel comfortable in using it more consistently, both because it&#x27;s lighter and understanding now that it&#x27;s also a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I decided to try loreal SPF as an alternative to my usual more expensive day cream (presciptives -a perfect world SPF 25).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive for what your getting&lt;br /&gt;Broad spectrum SPF&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, silky lotion&lt;br /&gt;Nice efficient pump dispenser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;Very heavily perfumed (big turnoff for me)&lt;br /&gt;Lotion does not absorb as well as other creams and left me feeling a little greasy on hot days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be good for anyone with dry skin looking for a day cream with a higher SPF and who is not bothered by the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s supposed to happen in 30 days, but this has become my go-to daily lotion.  It leaves skin smooth and satiny, is very light and not greasy.  The chic red packaging is a plus,too!</li>
    <li> It has a very strong fragrance, and i could not use it. It would be a good lotion if they make it fragrance free.</li>
    <li> This is a soothing moisturizer that&#x27;s not too heavy or oily.  Here&#x27;s a run down on some aspects of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:  It smells like freshly mown grass.  The smell is not overpowering however and fades fairly quickly.  I&#x27;m sensitive to scents and often get headaches with the fragrances.  I had no problems with this product though I&#x27;d prefer it had no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Reaction:  Though I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s I still get breakouts but had no problems whatsoever with this product.  It melts into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.  I worked the excess in to my hands which felt wonderful.  I dabbed a little under my eyes but that caused them to water though I was careful not to get any into the eye itself.  This is the second moisturizer that I&#x27;ve experienced this with so I&#x27;m thinking there must be something in these products that I&#x27;m personally reacting too.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is more universal or just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF:  It has a 30 SPF which I love since my foundation only has a 15.  In the Los Angeles sun this is a real plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently moved to a hotter climate and even though my brown skin provides a layer of protection from the sun, I&#x27;ve been advised to utilize a good sunscreen as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured,  why not use one that multitasks? I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or fine lines yet, but they are lurking around,ready to pounce out at any time. My hope is that Revitalift will prolong the inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is white and creamy with no smell. I mix it in with my moisturizer and it mixes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this formula is the greasiness. I have very oily, blemish prone skin and I have a constant oil slick on my T-zone. This product does not help this issue at all. I&#x27;ve resolved to use is sparingly from now on.</li>
    <li> I got this item not just for the advertising about \\&quot;lifting sagging jawline\\&quot; but because of my dry skin and sun sensitivity. This is an excellent product for me. The Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion has a wonderful feel. It is very silky and it takes only a very small amount to smooth all over the face and neck area. There is no greasy feel and it works great under my normal makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main purpose as stated on the container is \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; and it does a great job. It is a broad spectrum SPF 30, but it also rehydrates dry skin. The box says it \\&quot;repairs wrinkles\\&quot; and it seems to do this through adding hydration to dry skin, and it does this without adding oil. So over the couple of weeks of my  daily use of the product, I have had no reaction, no pimples or blemishes, and no oily buildup during the day even with my own makeup put on over the Revitalift product. This product also has a very faint, light scent that is clean and sharp, but not strong enough to interfere with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I like the container it comes in. It is a compact 4 inch tall by 1 inch round canister with a pump action lid. This means that it travels well. Also the lid is flat and you can activate/open or close with a simple twist. In this way it won&#x27;t accidentally get compressed in a purse or bag when traveling so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the contents getting all over the inside of your bag. I love a well-designed and well-engineered container.</li>
    <li> I received the Loreal Revitalift Triple Power Day lotion as a vine request. I have been using it for several weeks now and I think it works great as a daily moisturizer which also has spf 30 sunscreen in it. The pump it comes in dispenses a small amount which is usually enough for applying to my face and sometimes I take a little more to also apply to my neck. The pump also has a lock position to prevent the product from accidentally being pressed when packing in an overnight bag or whenever you are not using it. I apply this day lotion before applying my makeup. It goes on light, not greasy and seems to be absorbed quickly. I think the scent is light and appealing and did not think it was overpowering at all. I had it under my makeup when we went to the beach and I didn&#x27;t end up getting sunburn at all. We did go later in the day and were there for a couple hours. My only complaint is that sometimes I find that my mascara has run a little bit which seems to happen usually when a moisturizer is applied before I apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to 1. repair wrinkles, 2. redensify, 3 re-firm but please note it does state on the box to apply after Revitalift Triple Power concentrated serum for best results. It also has a recommended regimen of Step 1. Foaming Cleanser, 2. Triple Power Concentrated Serum, 3. Triple Power Eye Cream, 4. am: Triple Power spf30, PM: Triple Poewr Deep-Acting Day/Night cream.  For me I only used the Revitalift Triple Power Day lotion and I found it to be a great daily moisturizer with the added protection of an spf30 sunscreen but I did not really notice and changes in appearances of fine lines or any changes in re-firming my skin tone. Maybe with longer use of this product and using their whole skin regimen it may work better, but I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
    <li> The main difference of this from other Revitalift products is this has sunscreen.  Noting this, there are equally as good products with sunscreen that cost a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following are the claims it makes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fights wrinkles, re-firms contours and replenishes facial volume - While it does this Revitalift has better products that do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powered by our highest concentration of Pro-Xylane, a patented ingredient that is shown to stimulate collagen production - It is average on this claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complexion is immediately more radiant and over time wrinkles appear smoother, skin feels firmer, and appears lifted - This is not proven and sounds more like average sales talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broad spectrum UVA/UVB SPF 30 protection - Many less expensive and equally as good products have this.</li>
    <li> This is a kind of multitasking product, but something in it irritated my skin, and after using it just a few days, I had to stop.</li>
    <li> As a lotion, this is a good product. Goes on nicely. Nice pump delivery system. Feel nice, not oily. And the added SPF is an extremely nice addition. A few caveats: As something that is advertised to revitalize, um, not so sure. Maybe I have to use it longer but I can&#x27;t tell a difference. The other watch-out is that this product is not water-proof. So as an everyday lotion, it gets good marks. Just be careful around the pool.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear as a sunscreen but it also works well as a moisturizer and wrinkle cream.  I put this on after my day lotion and I can really see the difference in the fine lines around my eyes.  They seem much finer after I use this product and I like that it is a sunscreen as well.  My skin feels very soft and tighter after I use this product.</li>
    <li> I buy this primarily because it is very effective as a sun screen that moisturizes my skin and prevents my fair skin from burning.  A little bit seems to go a long way.  My husband used some when we went kayaking and was surprised at how well it worked as an effective sun skreen.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, goes on smooth not greasy. I will be not only ordering this again but be looking into their entire skin care line. Typically I use high end products and went to this because of budgetary reasons but I will continue to use this. Good bye high price department store and hello to a thicker wallet.</li>
    <li> Nice and light for day use</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the feeling my skin receives with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate the expedited service I received it earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone than likes Revit lift products,</li>
    <li> My friend picked this up for me because her mother bought her two and she didn&#x27;t want the other one.  I tried it but wow did  it sting my skin and eyes!  I didn&#x27;t see any reviews having this same experience so I thought I would mention it. Then I looked at the ingredients and saw mostly chemicals.  I decided to look it up on the Environmental Working Group and it rated it as a high health concern.  I am now going to go looking for a gentle moisturizer with sunscreen  that won&#x27;t sting my eyes and skin and that will not be a health concern to use it.  I can use serums for the &#x27;youngifying&#x27; effect anyway.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product to use on summer.It&#x27;s very effective and I love it.I would recomend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for the past 3 weeks: every morning after showering in lieu of my usual post-shower face lotion. Three weeks isn&#x27;t enough to have formed an opinion on whether or not the lotion actually \\&quot;revitalizes\\&quot; or fills in wrinkles or takes years off of my appearance (and we have a maximum of 4 weeks to write Amazon Vine reviews). I also can&#x27;t say that this product blocks sun better or worse than any other similar product on the market. Have I gotten sunburned during normal outdoor exposure while using it? No. Would I have gotten sunburned if I&#x27;d been using a different product with SPF 30? Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the subtle scent of the lotion, and it&#x27;s not as oily as other sunscreen products I&#x27;ve tried. However, for over $13 per (small) bottle, I can&#x27;t say that I think it&#x27;s particularly worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial lotion for a little over a month now. I like the texture (it is very light), how it smells, and the fact it does not irritate my sensitive skin. With all that said, I really do not see a difference in my skin; therefore, other than being a light moisturizing cream for the face it does not hold up to its promises.</li>
    <li> I chose to review this product because the moisturizer that I swear by is no longer being manufactured.  At least that is what the Spa that I visit told me.  I love, love the SPF 15 facial moisturizer with no tint that is made by Dermalogica.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to find it for the longest time.  It would leave you feeling clean with a bit of sparkle, all the while protecting my face.  Fast forward to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Revitalift Triple Power SPF 30...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that I hate this product... No, I know that I hate this product.  NOwhere on the packaging do you read all of the information that is provided on Amazon&#x27;s order page.  There are no instructions!  The only thing that is stated with any clarity is that the product is a SUNSCREEN!  I did not purchase this to be a sunscreen, but rather a moisturizer with lifting properties that had SPF included.  This is just sunscreen in an expensive bottle.  I am lost.  How do you market a product that claims to do all of these things and then just send a bottle along with directions that read like this: Directions: SUNSCREEN.  I could go on for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a sunscreen, I didn&#x27;t burn when I was outside.  I did not notice any positive changes regarding the &#x27;triple power&#x27; claims.  The lotion is a bit thick but it applies clear.  The scent was typical and pleasant.  The pump locks by twisting, so there aren&#x27;t any worries of spilling in your bag.  On a positive note, I did find that I did not sweat streaks of it.  The negative is that it would feather, as if my face was shedding old dirty skin.  EWW.  The biggest annoyance of all is that it took me a good week to realize what that bitter disgusting taste was.  You are wondering why I would be eating my sunscreen?!  I wasn&#x27;t.  For the oddest reason, the whole month of daily application, I would find that about thirty-minutes later I would have this awful bitter taste in my mouth.  It didn&#x27;t make sense.  Then I stopped using the product because I found that I am extremely Vitamin D deficient and need the sun to penetrate my skin.  The week that I stopped, I didn&#x27;t have that taste any longer.  I put it on for this review&#x27;s sake and there it was.  I do not apply to my lips, so I do not understand how it would possibly penetrate the surface of my skin and end up in the back of my throat??  Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend because it was labeled something other than what I received.  As a sunscreen it does it&#x27;s job, but it is too expensive and still feathers.  Hate the flavor, hate the claims.  Hate the product.I am extremely Vitamin D deficient and need the sun to penetrate my skin.  The week that I stopped, I didn&#x27;t have that taste any longer.

    <li> great paraben free 30 spf suncreen and beauty lotion!</li>
    <li> Great product!  The perfect day lotion and it DOES lift.</li>
    <li> Pros: Doesn&#x27;t smell like suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells great, feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I called to make sure it&#x27;s not just spf -- nope, it has the anti aging goodies in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s not a moisturizer (or not a strong one), so simply add some of their Moisture Blur to it (a few minutes later).</li>
    <li> This product is another in the long line of L&#x27;Oreal products that I have found to be of high quality. I would recommend this to anyone old enough to know the phrase &amp;#34;danger Will Robinson&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> As a sunscreen this product works as expected.  As a daily moisturizer I find it to be too greasy and as the day goes on it seems to cake up in the corner of my eyes and cause them to get &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for several months now and do not notice any improvement in skin tone or or change in the appearance wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not back up any of the manufacturer&#x27;s claims of better looking skin and as a sunscreen alone I feel it is too expensive of a product. (2 stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(reviewed by Linda)</li>
    <li> After just a few weeks I see a noticeable difference in my jawline, neck and chest. I am using this with a 0.5mm derma roller and several other RevitaLift products. I am very happy with the effectiveness of this product line.</li>
    <li> Smooth and light.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I like it because it goes on smooth it is not greasy and the product is trustworthy.  I have used it for years and the product has many stages to choose from.</li>
