### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!  </li>
      <li>Awesome product, well done Clinique.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S THE GREATEST!!..</li>
      <li>IT IS THE BEST</li>
      <li>YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO!!!....</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>If you get it in your hair your hair will take on kind of a purple look!</li>
      <li>It gives your skin a warm glow.</li>
      <li>Gives me a healthy glow when travelingband changing time zones.</li>
      <li>It looked like it was sitting on top of my skin and started crumbling all over my face.</li>
      <li>but you get so much more, three products in one and the ability to customize to your skin tone.</li>
      <li>Yes, it does cost more</li>
      <li>It has 12 or so different shades to match your skin tone best plus has sunscreen plus moisturizer.</li>
      <li>MUCH better product, also sold by amazon, is the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Be sure to wash your fingers after application.</li>
      <li>It does not wash off, so i love it</li>
      <li>I know this is a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; product, but I have been using this for years since the women&#x27;s bronzers are more self-tanners and change your skin color or are just powder or tinted makeup.  </li>
      <li>The product works great, produces a realistic temporary tan.</li>
      <li>It does not streak and, most important, it does not come off on clothing.</li>
      <li>Listen guy&#x27;s ... if you&#x27;re going to bronze and not tan, you better buy the best, hands down.</li>
      <li>EASY TO USE AND DOES NOT STREAK OR RUN....</li>
      <li>I HAVE USED THIS FINE PRODUCT FOR YEARS.....</li>
      <li>I dab it on my face, lightly rub it in every morning, and wash it off at night.  </li>
      <li>First, it does not go on very smoothly at all.</li>
      <li>Although i was hesitant at first out of fear of looking like a cheeto, I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product  a try.  </li>
      <li>Apply the moisturizer-bronzer mixture on forehead, nose and cheeks or allover for a full face tan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Looks natural and very easy as it mixes with your moisturizer.</li>
      <li>IT BRINGS A SUMMER LOOK AND SMILE ON MY FACE....</li>
      <li>stuff honestly creates such a real-looking tan, it&#x27;s almost cheating.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>However I have noticed that if you don&#x27;t pair it with the right moisturizer</li>
      <li>Not sure why the reviews for this product are so great.</li>
      <li>Definitely mix with your favorite moisturizer instead of using the product alone.</li>
      <li>so it is smooth and always looks natural.  </li>
      <li>But buy it elsewhere - most retailers (e.g. Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Sephora) charge $16 for the same 2 oz.</li>
      <li>the bronzer is so natural looking people were asking me where I went on vacation!!!!</li>
      <li>I have naturally light completion and this gives my face a little more color -</li>
      <li>so you can really dial this product into exactly what you want.</li>
      <li>Clinique definitely holds true to their quality image with this one!</li>
      <li>Very unnatural looking.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any makeup residue and blends in with you real skin tone</li>
      <li>For some reason, it is only available as a Men&#x27;s product, but it used to be available as a regular item in the Clinique line for Women.</li>
      <li>Seriously, one can get this at any good department store for $15.  </li>
      <li>Overall I really love this product and will absolutely be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
      <li>Love this bronzer Use it everyday</li>
      <li>pretty sure you can save serious $ by going with bonne bell</li>
      <li>You can get it right before you leave the house and have confidence it doesn&#x27;t smell or have any kind of &#x27;feel&#x27; that you are wearing fake tan.  </li>
      <li>It is so natural looking and works!</li>
      <li>Pour a little of your favorite facial moisturizer in your palm&lt;br</li>
      <li>After it is rubbed in it gives my skin an even natural looking complexion.</li>
      <li>I was told years ago that this is the same product as the Women&#x27;s bronzer, and it is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply, I just put on some moisturizer and use a few small dots to cover my entire face.</li>
      <li>I think this product made/makes my skin breakout a little more than usual...</li>
      <li>when applying it requires a lot more than a few small dots to actually notice any difference.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I decided to buy this product at Sephora after reading rave reviews on here. My face is very pale during the winter months and I have been desperately looking for a product to give my face some natural looking color. Although i was hesitant at first out of fear of looking like a cheeto, I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product  a try.  It is very easy to apply, I just put on some moisturizer and use a few small dots to cover my entire face. After it is rubbed in it gives my skin an even natural looking complexion. However I have noticed that if you don&#x27;t pair it with the right moisturizer when applying it requires a lot more than a few small dots to actually notice any difference.  Overall I really love this product and will absolutely be purchasing it again in the future. Clinique definitely holds true to their quality image with this one!</li>
    <li> Listen guy&#x27;s ... if you&#x27;re going to bronze and not tan, you better buy the best, hands down. Guerlain Mens Terracotta powder with brush, and Clinique Men&#x27;s Non-Streak Bronzer liquid... and YES... you do need both, if you don&#x27;t want to look like you went to a spray-orange-on tanning booth at a trailer park tanning salon. Trust! lol</li>
    <li> the bronzer is so natural looking people were asking me where I went on vacation!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Clinique non-streak bronzer on my face and forearms for years! For some reason, it is only available as a Men&#x27;s product, but it used to be available as a regular item in the Clinique line for Women. I was told years ago that this is the same product as the Women&#x27;s bronzer, and it is exactly the same. It does not streak and, most important, it does not come off on clothing. I dab it on my face, lightly rub it in every morning, and wash it off at night.  I use it on my forearms when wearing short-sleeved clothing in the summer months.</li>
    <li> I think this product made/makes my skin breakout a little more than usual... But I&#x27;m addicted to this product so much it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to stop using it. It is so natural looking and works! Definitely mix with your favorite moisturizer instead of using the product alone. Will order again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I wish this product didn&#x27;t break my skin out.. but its gotten to the point where my skin looks so bad it was very idiotic of me if i continued to use this product. I like everything about this product besides the fact that it makes my skin break out. Will not be ordering again. I hope everyone else doesn&#x27;t experience the same problem.</li>
    <li> Seriously, one can get this at any good department store for $15.  It  lowers my esteem for Amazon that they would purvey something at three times what one would pay from Saks or Bloomingdale&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The product works great, produces a realistic temporary tan. But buy it elsewhere - most retailers (e.g. Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Sephora) charge $16 for the same 2 oz. tube for which the Amazon merchant (Beauty Pub) is changing $53!</li>
    <li> I know this is a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; product, but I have been using this for years since the women&#x27;s bronzers are more self-tanners and change your skin color or are just powder or tinted makeup.  This product blends in like a gel instead of like liquid makeup so it is smooth and always looks natural.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any makeup residue and blends in with you real skin tone (you never look orange). I just hope Clinique doesn&#x27;t discontinue this one!</li>
    <li> This bronzer is quite dark, but a little goes a long way. It gives your skin a warm glow. Be sure to wash your fingers after application.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer Use it everyday</li>
    <li> I have naturally light completion and this gives my face a little more color - As if I have been in the sun a bit.  I usually put a some face lotion with it when I apply it (like Cetaphil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have gray hair, be care for when you rub it on your forehead. If you get it in your hair your hair will take on kind of a purple look!</li>
    <li> If you use this product straight out of the bottle and smear it on your face, it will look awful. I talked to the lady at the Clinique counter and she said to apply this properly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Pour a little of your favorite facial moisturizer in your palm&lt;br /&gt;2) Mix a TINY drop of the Bronzer in and swirl in your palm to blend evenly&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply the moisturizer-bronzer mixture on forehead, nose and cheeks or allover for a full face tan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff honestly creates such a real-looking tan, it&#x27;s almost cheating.&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t buy from Amazon, ridiculous price for a 2 oz. Should be $16-20 anywhere else</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS FINE PRODUCT FOR YEARS.....SIMPLY PUT..IT IS THE BEST AROUND...I USE A DAB ON MY FACE IN THE WINTER......IT BRINGS A SUMMER LOOK AND SMILE ON MY FACE....EASY TO USE AND DOES NOT STREAK OR RUN....IT&#x27;S THE GREATEST!!..TRY IT SOON....YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO!!!....</li>
    <li> Great product. Looks natural and very easy as it mixes with your moisturizer. No worries about it developing over time when you are out and suddenly looking like an orange. And if you put too much on you can just re moisurise and thin it down or if not enough just reapply. You can get it right before you leave the house and have confidence it doesn&#x27;t smell or have any kind of &#x27;feel&#x27; that you are wearing fake tan.  Awesome product, well done Clinique.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time and have bought it again and again. It does not wash off, so i love it</li>
    <li> I tried this product just once and was horrified at the result and threw it away. First, it does not go on very smoothly at all. Second, the color is awful. Very unnatural looking. Third, it does nothing but color your face. No sunscreen, no moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MUCH better product, also sold by amazon, is the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer. It has 12 or so different shades to match your skin tone best plus has sunscreen plus moisturizer. You can choose regular or oil-free for the moisturizer so you can really dial this product into exactly what you want. Yes, it does cost more but you get so much more, three products in one and the ability to customize to your skin tone.</li>
    <li> The bonne bell gel bronzeris the same thing for a fraction of the price. I have been using Bonne Bell for years and was looking at this the other day....pretty sure you can save serious $ by going with bonne bell</li>
    <li> Not sure why the reviews for this product are so great. I added a drop to my daily moisturizer and it didn&#x27;t sink into my skin at all. It looked like it was sitting on top of my skin and started crumbling all over my face. I had to wash my face off to get it off. I&#x27;m so disappointed because I had high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Gives me a healthy glow when travelingband changing time zones.</li>
