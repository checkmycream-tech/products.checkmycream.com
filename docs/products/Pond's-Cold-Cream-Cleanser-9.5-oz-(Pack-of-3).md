      <li>I get more compliments on my skin</li>
      <li>I wanted something more moisturizing</li>
      <li>After all these years, still nothing works better in removing makeup at the end of the day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product came on time and was in good condition.  The price was great.  I compared it to several places.  You can store this&lt;br /&gt;product.  I never had any problems keeping this for a while.</li>
    <li> Have used this cleansing cream for years. Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Why spend loads of money on fancy face cleaners?  This works well, removes make up (including mascara, because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes), and moisturizer, leaving my face feeling great.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other face cleaners for dry skin, and I keep coming back to this basic.</li>
    <li> I wear very black mascara and full coverage foundation. It removes everything easily and keeps my skin soft. I wished I had discovered that many years ago.</li>
    <li> My mother used Ponds cold cream and her skin was beautiful.  I use Ponds and now the next generation of my family is using it.  It is the best at removing all your makeup, great for sensitive eye area, fresh smell.  Yes, it does leave a residue.  If you don&#x27;t like this use a mild cleanser after taking off your makeup.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I get more compliments on my skin and I&#x27;m in my late 50s now. Young girls are surprised to find out I use this.</li>
    <li> It takes off even the most stubborn eye makeup, long-wearing foundation and lipstick; leaves your skin soft, clean and moisturized; is VERY inexpensive and lasts a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else do you want?</li>
    <li> When I was a little girl my grandmother used this product.  I remembered the smell, I remember her wiping her throat and face with a white washcloth after, and I remember smearing it on and not liking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was 40 years ago - and now I can understand why grandmother loved to wash her face so often.  I have been a soap and water \\&quot;scrubber\\&quot; and I will do that still occasionally for the benefits of it.  But at \\&quot;my age\\&quot; I need to change-up because this product feels good and my face looks and feels less tight, dry and stretched especially around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with pond&#x27;s cold cream deep cleanser.</li>
    <li> i bought it with Pond&#x27;s anti-dark moisturizing creme. i was really happy with moisturizer but im not sure about this cleanser. when i open the box, the labels were off, the case was oily(probably the creme leaked out), and when i opened the jar, creme was hold together like a big chunk. so im wondering if it&#x27;s old or something.. plus i don&#x27;t really like the smell. i still tried on my face and massaged it like it says, and i wiped off with tissues and cloth. but still i felt really oily. but since i bought three, i guess i just have to keep trying to use and see how it goes. hopefully ill see the improvement.</li>
    <li> I have use Pond&#x27;s cold Cream for my very dry skin many many years. It help to smooth dry skin and make comfort all day long! With reasonable price too.</li>
    <li> Only one star because there is nothing less than one star to choose to indicate my disappointment that the product is not the same as it claims on the website. The ORIGINAL formula of Ponds Cold Cream has been changed and nothing has been stated by the company anywhere unless you are astute enough and have the eyesight to read the ingredients label. The ingredients listed on the website are the original 7 ingredients that this product has had for over 150 years! Which is why I ordered 18 of them! 2 years ago when the product changed, I bought a new jar brought it home and used it to my chagrin...The new product has 16 ingredients and some of them are irritants for people who have sensitive skin- LIKE ME! I know because my skin got itchy, burned and I removed it immediately, then I looked at the ingredients and noticed they had been changed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used and trusted this product since I was 11 years old which is now 40 years and my mother has used it for 70 years. She can no longer use it either. I have also recommended it to hundreds of patients. If a company does not understand that maintaining the honesty and integrity of a product is critical to the TRUST that a consumer has in it, there is no greater disappointment. Truth in advertising for beauty products is stretched.  I am an expert in the field of Cosmetic Health and have been now for over 30 years. There are new products out everyday but, when a long time trusted product changes and does not expose that it has made an executive decision based on cost of ingredients or as they claim a law set forth by the European Cosmetic Act on an ingredient for a product produced in the US, this is WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;2 years ago upon noticing the change, I shopped small drugstores around the country and bought The Last 37 Jars of Ponds Cold Cream. I am now writing a book by this title. If you have specific questions or a similar story about a product or you want to tell me a family beauty secret- please contact me.  I am also open to hearing from people at Unilever and Amazon.com as well to see how this can be remedied. Many people who depend on products they have used for a long time may have specific health issues or skin sensitivities. They use those products they have found that do not make their condition flare with confidence and that trust and the condition of their skin will be immediately compromised by the change in ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s cosmetics are not just beautifying our \\&quot;superficial\\&quot; appearance as once mandated, they are affecting the structure and function of our largest organ and although they should not have to limit their attempts to improve products companies should still be required to follow guidelines that protect the public from false advertising.I am also open to hearing from people at Unilever and Amazon.com as well to see how this can be remedied.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for the past 2 months or so, and I still can&#x27;t really make up my mind about it. Why? Because it&#x27;s unlike any other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, and I feel like it&#x27;s leaving a film over my face. This, to me, makes me feel not clean and has the potential for clogging pores. In fact, it did cause a few breakouts here and there, but nothing too major. Normally I have pretty normal skin that just suffers from some sensitivity. This couldn&#x27;t get any better regarding the sensitivity, but it&#x27;s just such a hard product to get used to. It&#x27;s completely water-resistant so I can&#x27;t even get it off my hands after I apply it to my face. I have to wipe them on a towel. Then, you can&#x27;t just splash water on your face - directions say you have to tissue off or moisten a towel and use that. I&#x27;ll continue using it but will not repurchase because it&#x27;s not as convenient as I thought it would be and like I said, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I am 39 years old and every year of that has been with bad skin. Oily and dry, acne and huge pores. Its been a long time coming for me to find something that works.I have spent huge amounts of cash on all the latest skin care with no good results. I remember my grandma using this when I was a child so I said why not. I bought some from the dollar store and massaged it in to my makeup covered face, DRY???? I was not used to that. Well I ran some hot water while i was massaging and wet a washcloth with that hot water. I laid it over my face for a few seconds then wiped the oily feeling residue off my face. I rinsed the cloth and wiped again. My face felt so soft, I decided to see how well it really cleaned, so I got a cotton round put some toner on it and wiped all over, even that lil crease beside the nose. The cotton round was white, my soap products do not clean like that. I have been using this for about a month now and my pores are much smaller. I just bought some in bulk. I wish I would have tried this stuff years ago.  PS: my fine wrinkles are plumping up too!!!!! YAY</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for something nice and simple to take off my makeup and clean my face. I opened up the jar and was a bit surprised at how...solid it is. the plus side to this is you don&#x27;t need very much at all. Just a little bit ges a long ways. I experimented with different ways to take it off, and I think I like wiping it off with makeup remover wipes from neutrogena best. Wiping it off with a damp towel is also an option, just don&#x27;t use one that&#x27;s white or that you like...the makeup will all be on it! (discovered this the hard way...) I love how this makes my skin feel. I didn&#x27;t get the greasy feel when I used the wipes. It removes my foundation and such perfectly! I tested and used one of my makeup wipes after I finished and there was no left-over makeup on it!  With that being said, I had no luck with my mascara. It isn&#x27;t even waterproof and it didn&#x27;t get much of it off and I had to use my normal eye makeup remover to really remove it. I can&#x27;t really see that as much of a detractor because I feel more comfortable using my eye makeup remover anyways than having the cream on it. All in all, I say its an awesome product and I wish I had discovered it earlier.</li>
    <li> Oh man, this product does wonders for you. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve splashed angel clouds on your body. It makes it all soft :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ponds for many many years.  It takes off make up at night and also acts as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a cold cream and thus it is greasy; thus, what makes it good.  It is made with mineral oil, which is one of the most emollient properties on the planet for your skin.  If you use this cream every day, you will have noticeably softer, smoother skin, guaranteed.     However, it IS greasy, and being so, also leaves a residue.  My husband complained about it:  \\&quot;What did you put on your skin? I don&#x27;t think you wiped it all off.\\&quot;  When actually I had wiped it all off.      So if you don&#x27;t mind the residue, buy this product; however, if you mind the greasy feel, seek elsewhere.     Update:  Pond&#x27;s does have links to animal testing through Johnson and Johnson, their parent corporation.  If you love cold cream but this bothers you, try Bath and Body Works C. O. Bigelow Cold Cream.  --OR-- make it yourself.  Cold cream is notoriously easy to make.  Google \\&quot;Cold Cream Recipes\\&quot; and you will come up with a plethora of recipes to use.  I like using almond oil instead of mineral oil as it feels more relaxing.</li>
    <li> This definitely serves it&#x27;s purpose.  I&#x27;ve seen others comment on the formula change in 2010, but not having tried it before then I can&#x27;t really draw a comparison.  It&#x27;s not pleasant to have on your skin... an overall heavy, greasy feel that is very bothersome.  I usually put this on right before getting in the shower, then wash it off the a cloth while standing under the spray.  I can&#x27;t imagine just wetting a cloth in the sink and washing it off, as some others describe, because I can still feel that greasy film on my skin... It definitely doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly for me, as some have said.  Besides that inconvenience, though, this definitely works well, has a pleasant odor, and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> My skins feels so soft, and I believe I look younger.  One bottle lasts a LONG time.  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I have used these cleansing cream since I was 18 years old. Always as expected.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ponds Cleanser for quite a few years.  I was tired of pricy department store products.  And the price from Amazon was much better that the drugstore.</li>
    <li> After all these years, still nothing works better in removing makeup at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> For years I had been searching for the perfect cleanser for my skin. I&#x27;ve tried department store brands like Clinique. I&#x27;ve tried Mary Kay, Avon, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; Shea butter soaps, and plain soaps like Ivory, Dove, Jergens, Aveeno. You name it. No matter what I used, I had dry patches, blotchy and itchy skin, and the occasional (usually monthly) breakout. My skin was literally my worst feature. I was upset about my skin daily.   A few weeks ago, I tried a sample of Pond&#x27;s Evening Soothe Towelettes. I loved them immediately (will write a review on those next), and decided to try Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream to switch things up a bit. I had read so many good reviews on this product and found it at Walmart for about $6 a jar. I figured it was worth a try. The three pack offered by Amazon is a good deal.  After using Pond&#x27;s Cool Classic just TWO times, I see improvement. I first used it in the morning, rubbing it in gently and then wiping with a damp, warm washcloth. I used a small dot of Oil of Olay on my face and neck, but otherwise didn&#x27;t feel the need to put on additional moisturizer. I waited about 10 minutes and then applied powder mineral foundation. What a difference. It felt wonderful going on and my skin didn&#x27;t feel tight or itchy AT ALL. After using other products, I would sometimes have to reapply moisturizer before putting on mineral makeup because of dry patches. And even then, my skin never felt completely moisturized. Also, I&#x27;m often really sensitive to fragrance in products. I worried that the fragrance in Pond&#x27;s would irritate my skin and cause red blotches, but it doesn&#x27;t. The scent is on the strong side, but now that I know won&#x27;t get a rash from it, I actually like it and look forward to the scent.  I fully expected my face to feel oily later in the day. Yes, this cold cream IS based with mineral oil so it definitely feels greasy going on. It scared me at first, and I think it was a good choice for me to remove most of it with a damp rag rather than a dry cloth or tissue. Usually my forehead is an oil patch as evening rolls around. This didn&#x27;t happen at all. My skin still felt soft and comfortable.  Using it at the end of the day is wonderful too. It takes off waterproof mascara as easily as it claims, and my skin feel super soft.  I truly wish I would have used this earlier in life. I could have avoided years of red, itchy, irritated skin. I can understand why some people wouldn&#x27;t like this product if they prefer to feel \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; after washing their face, but it&#x27;s the perfect cleanser for me.</li>
    <li> Does the trick without drying my skin. Great Ponds product.</li>
    <li> Ponds cold cream is the only cleanser that goes deep into the pores and cleanses all the hidden dirt and rubbish. This cream will even remove the waterproof and all-day long-lasting make up effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;Forget the expensive creams and all the other brands... They do not even come close to the power of Ponds. That&#x27;s why this is the only cream that has survived the test of time ever. It&#x27;s been around since the time of my grandmother (that&#x27;s 3 generations ago).</li>
    <li> I am using this as my night time cleanser and make up remover.  It is not drying or too oily.  I apply a moderate amount focusing on my eye area (for mascara).  Then I wipe with a warm damp cloth.  It removes all the make up as I had hoped, but the scent is a little stronger than necessary.  It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s perfume strong, but it lingers and I tend to be sensitive to scents.  I will keep buying, but might look for a different scent/formula next time.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pond&#x27;s products for a long time. I cannot do without this. Use it every day. It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Jeannie Walker (Award-Winning Author) &amp;#34;I Saw the Light&amp;#34; - A True Story of a Near-Death Experience</li>
    <li> Works &#x27;okay&#x27; although waterproof makeup did not come off completely. I prefer to stick with regular makeup remover and face wash over this cold cream. It does leave the skin soft after leaving it on for half an hour. This stuff probably works better in weather that isn&#x27;t always hovering around refrigerator temperatures. I give this 3 stars for &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34;, because it&#x27;s probably okay for some people, although I do not prefer it myself.</li>
    <li> Ponds Cool Classic is not the old formula that our grandmothers used. From what I have been able to gather, some where around 2009 Ponds changed their formula.  Now instead of what our grandmothers and great grandmothers used we have a product with methylparaben in it as well as a host of other chemicals. And just so you know dear reviewer, parabens have been linked to breast cancer and hormonal issues in women.  I can&#x27;t imagine why Ponds would change their old formula which was used with incredible success by generations of women, but they have, and its certainly not for the better.  After receiving my order, I was so disappointed when I saw the label.  It did not contain the ingredients listed on this site (and in Amazons defense a lot of web sites online listed ponds old version ingredients) I&#x27;m so disappointed that Ponds would change such an old classic and name it Classic..how very misleading!!  Buyer beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what Ponds USED to be made of: Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Water, Beeswax (Apis Mellifera), Ceresin, Sodium Borate, Fragrance (Parfum), Carbomer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the Ponds Cool \\&quot;CLASSIC\\&quot; version contains:&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Oil , Water , Ceresin , Beeswax , Triethanolamine , Behenic Acid , Fragrance , Ceteth-20 , Cetyl Alcohol , Carbomer , DMDM Hydantoin , Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate , Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking forward to being \\&quot;old school\\&quot; and use this product like my gram. She was beautiful and had flawless young looking skin.</li>
    <li> The new Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream has added seven (7) new chemicals which are horrid for the skin and eyes.  If you haven&#x27;t figured out what is burning your skin and eyes (feels like first degree burns) then it&#x27;s time you did.  Took me two (2) weeks to figure out what was causing it.  Thank God for the aloe vera plant!  That is what I used to heal my skin each time I burned it with Pond&#x27;s cream.  I was an avid user of Pond&#x27;s cream for 33 years and my whole family used it.  I am trying to find an old jar of the old formula but haven&#x27;t been successful yet.  I&#x27;m sure the sales of Pond&#x27;s cream went down considerably.  I predict that if the Pond&#x27;s Company went back to the old formula, their sales would jump 50% at the least.</li>
    <li> I massage cream onto face neck and eye lashes. Leave it to melt into skin for 5 plus minutes while I brush my teeth. I remove it with warm flannel thoroughly and then remove residue with cotton wool pads and rosewater. Very happy with this routine. Skin is ready for moisturiser. I am in my 50s and have tried various other expensive brands which didn&#x27;t compare to ponds. Old fashioned tried and tested product has stood test of time.</li>
    <li> Since Pond&#x27;s was discontinued the production in Brazil, my mother like the opportunity to purchase the product via amazon. Thank&#x27;s for all.</li>
    <li> I love Ponds cold cream.  I have acne prone skin but using this as my night time cleanser keeps my skin clear and soft.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it!  This product has been around forever and there is a good reason!  It removes makeup so well (even eye makeup) and leaves my skin so nicely moisturized .  I tissue it off and then use a very warm cloth to remove any excess.  Feels great!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I only use this PONDS Cream and bottled water on my skin.and it&#x27;s perfect! Every time I think of changing to  another Make-Up-Remover I get allergies and ugly skin and, as always, I come back to my wonderful PONDS COLD CREAM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summer I wash it off and in winter I leave it on, to protect my face from the cold air. It truly works!</li>
    <li> My grandmother and my mother had flawless, beautiful skin and this was all they used.  It has been an excellent cream for generations.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Ponds then Dove deep cleaners for many years and it is no longer available in NZ, so delighted to be able to purchase on line.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who has used Ponds or Dove deep cleanser in the past.</li>
    <li> How many times I&#x27;ve washed my face only to leave awful make-up marks AFTER thinking it was clean?  I&#x27;ve always known about Ponds, but thought it was just too old fashioned.  Boy was I wrong.  Out of desperation to keep my pores clear of make-up, so they stay small and young looking :), I bought this to try.  I am sure glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ever made me think that a facial cleaner whose main ingredient are always water would remove MY oil and make-up when oil and water don&#x27;t mix?  So now I use this as a make-up remover, then lather up with my foamy cleanser afterwards and no more make-up stained towels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally oily skin and am prone to adult acne.  I was worried that because the main ingredient in this product is mineral oil that it would break me out.  I have been using it for 6 months now and my skin in actually clearer.  (Probably because I am getting all of hte make-up out and not over drying my skin trying to get it clean anymore.)</li>
    <li> It gets two stars because it doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the ingredients are cheap and toxic.  Mineral oil is awful. All of these chemicals leech into your body via you skin.  Do your research on each of the chemicals before you purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this because you have sensitive skin, then consider cleansing with olive oil.  It cleans well and won&#x27;t break you out.  Then moisturize with sweet almond oil.  I add a few drops of tea tree oil into the almond oil, and that keeps my skin clean and moisturized naturally!  I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and hard to find. Additionally, Amazon has the best price on this. It is well worth it to purchase this on line. Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 with olive complication. I have combination skin with my skin becoming more dry as I age. My issues are large pores and some hormonal chin acne that I keep under control with 3% benzoyl peroxide used nightly.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Purpose face cleanser for YEARS along with their face lotion. I wanted something more moisturizing so I thought I give Pond&#x27;s a try. I used it for alittle over and week and the breakout became too much and I decided to stop using it. I only used it at night but when I woke, my face felt very greasy. Even after washing, during the day my make up seemed to be slipping away. I LOVED the smell and the fact that my face was so soft but I sure don&#x27;t need pimples. My skin could balance out if I would have tried a bit longer but I am unwilling and it&#x27;s just too greasy for my liking. It seems to be a good buy for some but I&#x27;m passing.</li>
    <li> Having hit that middle-aged dry skin time of my life I decided to ask around and find out what \\&quot;older\\&quot; women were using for their skin to keep it soft and supple.  The overwhelming response was Ponds.  OK, that was simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only managed to use this for a week before I started breaking out like a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product for removing make-up but it leaves a greasy layer that on first blush seems like it would work as a deep moisturizer, but for me, it just left the perfect playground for pimples and a slight itching, like little invisible bugs were running across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that this product works so well for others, but for my skin type, it was just the wrong combination.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser been using it for years :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 50 years. It is wonderful for removing makeup. How nice that after all this time it is still great. Also arrived early, thank you.</li>
    <li> This product has been around for a long, long time and has proven its worth many times over.  Never found one I liked better.</li>
    <li> I have had bad skin my whole life and tried everything. A friend of mine mentioned how awesome ponds has been for a deep cleaning whenever she breaks out so I thought \\&quot;Why not? What&#x27;s another product?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I was so surprised that this product could be used without water and still clean better than the traditional cleansing method.  My breakouts are pretty much non-existent except once a month when the hormones go crazy, but it is no where near as bad as it used to be. The product smells great and leaves my skin moisturized enough that I do not need any other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product morning and night and pair it with Neutrogena Skin Clearing Makeup and my skin feels more under control.  I highly recommend to those who have tried everything.  It is a small investment that might just work for you too</li>
    <li> Received on time and exactly what I wanted. Great product to remove makeup.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, but just realized how much easier it is to order through this site than to go to a regular store and hope to find it in stock!</li>
    <li> Like several other reviews have already pointed out, this is NOT the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; Ponds, and it&#x27;s pretty disgusting that they&#x27;re toting it as such because it is a cocktail of unnecessary and irritating chemicals that make this anything BUT cool and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old jar of Ponds contains: Mineral Oil, Water, Beeswax, Cersin, Sodium Borate, Fragrance, Carbomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new \\&quot;classic\\&quot; Ponds: Mineral Oil, Water, Ceresin, Beeswax, Triethanolamine, Behenic Acid, Fragrance, Ceteth 20, Cetyl Alcohol, Carbomer, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why suddenly after nearly 100 years they decided to add a ton of chemicals to an otherwise tried and true formula, but I&#x27;m not drawing attention to this just to toot my own horn.  This new formula wreaks absolute havoc on my skin.  Breakouts, rashes, intense burning near my eyes... at first I didn&#x27;t even know what was causing it because I&#x27;ve used Ponds forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As soon as I eased off using Ponds the skin troubles vanished.  It was one of the most painful experiences I&#x27;ve had with a skincare product, and I&#x27;m positively heartbroken that it was caused by what I&#x27;ve considered to be my \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I&#x27;d say I won&#x27;t be purchasing Ponds cold cream anymore because I used to always recommend it to family and friends as my skincare secret, but I can&#x27;t put something on my skin that causes a fiery rash.  I am hoping there are other products out there that have the same list of classic ingredients I can use instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of looking at makeup removers and was reading the comments here.  I currently use Ponds and after I tissue off I use a warm-hot washcloth with gentle face cleanser and gently massage/clean my face.  This removes all residue and leaves your face cleansed. It&#x27;s not a rushed process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 40 years and hope to keep using it many years to come! I cannot find it in Sweden but if I can buy it on line it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I am a guy. None of you probably know this but this works like a charm on your hair. I have been using this for years on my hair and people always comment on how healthy my hair looks. It makes my hair hold it&#x27;s position when I comb it, and gives it a healthy shine. It&#x27;s super cheap And it&#x27;s good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;When your hair is damp, moisten your palms with a few drops of water. Depending on the length of your hair, spread the cold cream onto your moist palms and work through your hair. Wait until your hair is only slightly damp, and comb through. You will have shiny, healthy, soft and manageable hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream for several years, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream.  I love the dry skin cream, but unfortunately, not everyone can use cold cream.  I was using it daily for about 2 weeks, and I could not get my skin to stop breaking out.  Even after stopping usage of the product, it took my skin a good month to get back to normal. We all have different skin types, so while it may be a fantastic product for some, make sure if you use it without knowing how your skin reacts to a cold cream, that you only use it once or twice, and then WAIT and see how your skin responds!</li>
    <li> I am quite the coupon diva and could not beat this value.  Not even on major drug store sites or in store with sales/coupon deals.  This many jars will last a loooong time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a non harsh facial cleanser and someone recommended Ponds cold cream.  Since I knew this would be part of my daily regimen I purchased the three pack.  Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> I started using cold cream to clean my face a couple of years back, because it&#x27;s what my grandmother used, and she aged beautifully.  This works very well.  I simply smear it on my face, and then wipe it off using either a tissue or a square of very soft cotton knit (which can be purchased at a fabric store and cut into 6\\&quot; squares - washable and reusable!).  For those who have allergic reactions to this, I suggest using baby oil on a square of cotton (the first ingredient in cold cream is mineral oil), or Vaseline, which a friend&#x27;s mother uses.</li>
    <li> Have used Ponds Cold Cream for many, many years.  I use it to cleanse my face in the evening.  It removes makeup and mascara just fine.  It is inexpensive and does just as good a job as other more costly cleansers.  I follow with moisturizers, etc.  This was an even better buy getting three at once.  Will continue to use!</li>
    <li> This is not the original formula ponds has used for years!!! but they still advertise as the \\&quot;CLASSIC\\&quot; they changed the ingredients!!! Original had only 7 and worked great never made my skin burn. The other&#x27;s on here who have reported it making there skin burn probally got a batch of there new 12+ ingredient formula that also broke my skin out, burned, and doesn&#x27;t have the same smell or consistancy as the original. They no longer make the original but I am not the only one who wants them to bring it back!! Listen to your customer&#x27;s UNILEVER!!</li>
    <li> Ponds,  has  been  and  will  be  the  only  cleanser  I  purchase.  I  have  tried  many  different  brands  and  I  always  return  to ponds.</li>
    <li> Best cold cream cleanser there is. ,,used it for 59 yrs....</li>
    <li> Good price for a product I&#x27;ve used since I was 18. The good products never die. It&#x27;s almost thirty years later, and my skin is still soft and firm. I use it for make-up remover and night cream. Nice smell and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s has been around for a long time and it is still the best product for removing makeup. Save your money - the expensive products are no better - in fact, Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream is better! Don&#x27;t get the Pond&#x27;s &amp;#34;cucumber&amp;#34; cold cream unless you want something more liquidy (is that a word?).  I am now encouraging my granddaughter to become a Pond&#x27;s fan.</li>
    <li> The best price on a great product.  This always helps with staying young looking with clear clean skin.  And at this great price how can you go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is the best for removing make-up and cleaning your face as well. I bought the 3-pack and glad i did. It was a good value.</li>
    <li> Excellent makeup remover that isn&#x27;t harsh for the face and actually has a moisturizing benefit.</li>
    <li> Great price!  This product is great for removing makeup at the end of the day.  I apply it to dry skin and rub off with a warm washcloth.  It gets the most stubborn mascara off and is not irritating.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this product, I use A LOT of make-up (foundation, powder, primer, shadow, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick..) and this cream REALLY CLEAN very fast! I´ve used it for YEARS and It doesn´t leave ANY rest of make up on your face and care of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it AGAIN! :)</li>
    <li> Always loved this product, a lot cheaper buying three at a time.</li>
    <li> I have used Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser for many, many years to remove makeup, and have always been satisfied with the results.  The deal I got on Amazon was the best deal, and I didn&#x27;t have to travel to the store to replenish my supply.</li>
    <li> Fantastic.!!!!!!!.. as this item is not available any more in Australia I have some other items that I will be asking about ...........soon!!!!</li>
    <li> I LIKED REMOVE MY MAKE UP FAST</li>

    <li> I have used this product for many years and it has kept my skin looking soft and smooth  I love it and will continue to use it. The delivery time was excellent.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, and delivery time was excellent this time. But that has not being my experience in the past when delivery was slow and sometimes not at all.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this cream and she said that is very goo for taking your make up off, she would recommend it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that I use daily. I think it is just fantastic.</li>
    <li> Brought it for someone because they love this brand of cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount for the price is excellent. (3 jars of 9.5 oz)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retail stores smaller bottles cost anywhere from 6-9 dollars for one jar.</li>
    <li> Absolutely delighted with my purchase. Could only buy this in USA.</li>
