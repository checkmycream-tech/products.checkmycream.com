### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The one at Brookstone&#x27;s is the best but costly.</li>
      <li>Happy trimming!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at 1st</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
      <li>And after using it for a good while anyways, it doesn&#x27;t leave you with the feeling that it&#x27;s cut everything.      </li>
      <li>The nose hairs don&#x27;t collect nicely inside, instead they seem to fly all around, everywhere but the collecting area inside the head.</li>
      <li>No longer works and was not that good when it did work.</li>
      <li>in all, a fantastic piece, and definitely a great gift for the holidays!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job fairly well when you use a tissue.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold,easy to adjust,easy to clean,comfortable to use, no hair pulling, good price, good gift, good Amazon item....</li>
      <li>Built well and looks sleek and innovative !  </li>
      <li>It felt nice hand held but wouldn&#x27;t work...</li>
      <li>The trimmer does not require much maintenance, does a good job and the battery life is great.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s start making products in the USA, where we know how to make them right!!!</li>
      <li>I have owned 13 trimmers and this is by far the best trimmer on the market.  </li>
      <li>He likes it! :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe and that&#x27;s what I like about it, no pinching or pulling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought the Norelco beard trimmer and the Sanyo electric razor and they&#x27;re both way better than their Remington counterparts</li>
      <li>Fine ear hair is no problem.</li>
      <li>For the most effective trimming insert hairs directly into the trimmer.</li>
      <li>The rotor blade seating is constructed of cheap, brittle plastic.  </li>
      <li>I would prefer it was available in designer colors, but don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying it.  </li>
      <li>Nothing great, but if you stuck with it, it finally got the job done.</li>
      <li>Due to funky genes i grow hair out of my nose at an incredible rate.</li>
      <li>I originally rated the product as four stars, but this is unacceptable.</li>
      <li>Just received this Trimmer, never used one before and was excited to use it ......</li>
      <li>I clean it under water all the time and it has never malfunctioned like another user stated.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t be able to cut much by running the side of the trimmer tip along the sides of the nostrils.</li>
      <li>the product does a good job but is fragile.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive, no painful yanking of hairs</li>
      <li>(I only used it for my ears) and it seemed to work fairly well.</li>
      <li>just wasn&#x27;t worth it for the original 8 bucks.</li>
      <li>This fine piece of machinery is an absolute godsend!  </li>
      <li>lucky them).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting the Panasonic ER411NC instead and give that a try.</li>
      <li>a great job and is super fast too, no excuse for unsightly hairs hanging out anymore ;)</li>
      <li>thing actually does a pretty good job of trimming nose/ear hair</li>
      <li>Maybe it is me, but it is worth giving this a try .....</li>
      <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t have too much nose or ear hair, because in 6 months I couldn&#x27;t find one hair to clean from this thing.</li>
      <li>The light-weight trimmer can flex in the middle for an ergonomic, comfortable fit (the body is plastic, not metal).</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find the Pansonic one at the local store, which I liked rather much (4 stars), and instead went this gadget.  </li>
      <li>then this is an outstanding razor to get; if you want one that will last you, then--like me--begin to look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the switch was defective because at first I could make it run by pushing the switch towards the on position, but this procedure only worked once or twice.  </li>
      <li>, I bought the company.&amp;quot;) died and the family sold it to Rayovac (the battery maker) for about $500 million (</li>
      <li>If the clipper were more sturdy, it&#x27;d get a substantially higher rating because it has the potential to clip well.    </li>
      <li>This razor did the job well, but the switch came off in my hand within the first five minutes of using it.  </li>
      <li>One of the greatest inventions of the late 20th century ;-)</li>
      <li>It operates pretty quietly and smoothly compared to others I have owned.</li>
      <li>However, as a device the NE-3 is not particularly sturdy: after a year&#x27;s use, and maybe most the life of the battery, the on-off switch ceased to function.  </li>
      <li>The rotary tool doesn&#x27;t get very close to the surface of the skin to trim off the hair, instead it seems to cut the hair about half-way.  </li>
      <li>Ergonomically speaking, it is especially well designed and light weight.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really trim.</li>
      <li>It seems to do its job very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed.  </li>
      <li>, so why should any of their other stuff be any better?)...</li>
      <li>I sharply banged on my counter top.</li>
      <li>Either way, the inconvenience and annoyance is completely avoidable if you steer clear of this poorly designed product and purchase something with better design and construction, even if slightly more expensive: this product is a perfect example of the \\&quot;penny-wise, Pound-foolish\\&quot; aphorism.</li>
      <li>People with big noses will probably notice this more than others, problem is, I don&#x27;t have a big nose</li>
      <li>you really don&#x27;t waste that much money, but I sure wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>eight months ago because at the time, the reviews seemed pretty good, I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything particularly expensive and the fact that it was flexible seemed somewhat appealing.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>The cutter head assembly fell right off and wouldn&#x27;t snap securely back on like it should.</li>
      <li>I will be receiving my new one in the mail tomorrow.  </li>
      <li>Seems to work okay, the rotary blade tip seems small to me, takes a while to cut ?  </li>
      <li>Coarse nose hair get ready for some pain!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re willing to pay $8 for a razor that will likely break after a year&#x27;s use</li>
      <li>The motor gets hot within 2-3 minutes of continuous use, so you may need to take a short break between nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>As a trimmer, the NE-3 functions beautifully: after a year of biweekly use I have never once felt the discomfort of an unpleasantly pulled hair.  </li>
      <li>I bought this as a replacement for my 10-year old panasonic trimmer.  </li>
      <li>I like it so far.</li>
      <li>I had about given up and was going to try an experimental laser surgery process to remove the unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
      <li>When cleaning remember to rinse only the tip (don&#x27;t dunk the whole thing in the sink or use it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW</li>
      <li>It is waterproof to rinse off and is not messy at all.</li>
      <li>is the third Remington product I&#x27;ve ditched because it&#x27;s gone bad quickly (shaver, beard trimmer and this) because the company&#x27;s never been the same since Victor Kiam (&amp;quot;I liked the shaver so much</li>
      <li>It literally PULLS the hairs as it attempts to cut them, so either the blade is too dull or not spinning fast enough to truly cut the hairs cleanly.  </li>
      <li>Regardless of the fact that the trimmer is labeled for both wet and dry use, it works better under dry conditions.</li>
      <li>I found that the fact that it bent in the middle was totally unnecessary (to me) and the fact that the entire body was sort of a cheap plastic and not metal made it seem somewhat cheap, but since I only planned to use it about once a month for five minutes or so</li>
      <li>and this wasn&#x27;t exactly a major purchase, at $8.00, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it just makes too much noise but hardly trims, and it consumes batteries too fast.</li>
      <li>The whole device was full of water and useless.</li>
      <li>this reazon, I&#x27;m waiting \\&quot;papers\\&quot; to get my money back, hopefully not very long time.</li>

<li> It was no more or less important than a toothbrush.</li>
<li> (in other words, just about everything in the world).&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking about calling up and lying and saying the switch just popped off when I attempted to turn it on, but even if they said o.k., by the time you pack it up, go to the P.O., pay for the shipping (you pay) and then wait until you get old before you get it back</li>
<li> The only draw back is the thickness of the blades as you can cut tight to the skin but not as tight as scissors, but then again, this is much safer.</li>
<li> It does an okay job of cutting nose hair.</li>
<li> As long as it worked o.k., that&#x27;s all I cared about, until...</li>
<li> Does not speak well of its long term use, I&#x27;d say...</li>
<li> It trimmed nose and ear hair but took a long time to do a thorough job.  </li>
<li> The fact that it&#x27;s Wet/Dry is strange to me because why would he be using it in the shower.. with no mirror...</li>
<li> Usually when I trim my nose or ears, the hair grows back after several days, but the NE-3 will last two weeks!  </li>
<li> This product did not trim a single strand of hair.  </li>
<li> I still use my electric razor to finish off the nose hairs that this unit can&#x27;t cut - it&#x27;s usually the tiny, coarse hairs that&#x27;s close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
<li> It makes little noise, and is ergonomic in the hand and bends in the middle.  </li>
<li> but I think one of the small &#x27;holding&#x27; pieces must have gone down the drain, because I spent about a half hour, all for naught.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made in China (the modern day equivalent of &#x27;Made in Japan&#x27; of decades ago)</li>
<li> Unfortunatelly the one I received has rotary blades under a fixed head, not nice design head, and definitelly not doing the job I was expecting to do.</li>
<li> Why I would need to use it wet is beyond me, but some might appreciate that feature.  </li>
<li> The entire on/off switch mechanism flew all over the place like a jack in the box, including the switch (plastic), the few pieces (plastic) that hold it down and operate the &#x27;dial&#x27; that rotates it on or off and part of that &#x27;dial&#x27; mechanism (plastic) too.</li>
<li> I have also recently purchased other small electronic products made in China, and they are also unsatisfactory).  </li>
<li> Nothing to say other than the product does not work.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t really get it to stick up your nose all the way, because the body below the cutting head is too wide and doesn&#x27;t allow that extra cm you need.  </li>
<li> These tabs have a tendency to snap off, which means that you have to either 1) hold the assembly in place with a spare finger or your other hand, which severely limits mobility 2) try to rig something to hold it in place, or 3) replace the unit.      </li>
<li> This product is simply not worth using at any price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> He loves it... The fact that it&#x27;s Wet/Dry is strange to me because why would he be using it in the shower.. with no mirror... but he likes it alot regardless.</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer after my Panasonic crapped out after 2 1/2 years...actually, probably was damaged during air traveling.  Couldn&#x27;t find the Pansonic one at the local store, which I liked rather much (4 stars), and instead went this gadget.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like about it: &lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t really trim. The rotary tool doesn&#x27;t get very close to the surface of the skin to trim off the hair, instead it seems to cut the hair about half-way.  So it leaves you with small its and bits of hair.  And after using it for a good while anyways, it doesn&#x27;t leave you with the feeling that it&#x27;s cut everything.      &lt;br /&gt;2) The nose hairs don&#x27;t collect nicely inside, instead they seem to fly all around, everywhere but the collecting area inside the head. &lt;br /&gt;3) This device is poorly designed. You can&#x27;t really get it to stick up your nose all the way, because the body below the cutting head is too wide and doesn&#x27;t allow that extra cm you need.  People with big noses will probably notice this more than others, problem is, I don&#x27;t have a big nose and I have issues.    &lt;br /&gt;4) This gadget feels cheap and poorly constructed.  It&#x27;s faux metal doesn&#x27;t disguise its plasticky nature.   &lt;br /&gt;5) Putting this gadget into your nose, your nose smells funky metal smells, like the motor is over-heating. Very unpleasant to use. Avoid inhaling, while using it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end, for $8, yeah you really don&#x27;t waste that much money, but I sure wouldn&#x27;t buy it. &lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it to anyone? No. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> If the clipper were more sturdy, it&#x27;d get a substantially higher rating because it has the potential to clip well.    The problem is that a combination of design and poor materials makes this inadequate for consumers.      The rotor blade seating is constructed of cheap, brittle plastic.  The seating depends on some 4 mm tabs to hold the rotor assembly in place over the rest of the unit (which houses the motor).  These tabs have a tendency to snap off, which means that you have to either 1) hold the assembly in place with a spare finger or your other hand, which severely limits mobility 2) try to rig something to hold it in place, or 3) replace the unit.      Either way, the inconvenience and annoyance is completely avoidable if you steer clear of this poorly designed product and purchase something with better design and construction, even if slightly more expensive: this product is a perfect example of the \\&quot;penny-wise, Pound-foolish\\&quot; aphorism.</li>
    <li> Had this less than 3 months.  No longer works and was not that good when it did work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this devise to save myself from puncture wounds trying the same cut with pointed scissors. The only draw back is the thickness of the blades as you can cut tight to the skin but not as tight as scissors, but then again, this is much safer. It makes little noise, and is ergonomic in the hand and bends in the middle.  It is waterproof to rinse off and is not messy at all. P.S. Do not use the unit with the battery mistakenly in backwards, ouch!!!!</li>
    <li> the product does a good job but is fragile. i dropped mine once from a height of 5 ft on a carpet and its button and the parts behind it were all over the place. after i put it back together it didnt malfunction though.</li>
    <li> I purchased my trimmer several months ago. I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at 1st but I gave it some time. I didn&#x27;t think that it was cutting anything the 1st time I used it but by the 2nd or 3rd use, I changed my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;This thing actually does a pretty good job of trimming nose/ear hair and it&#x27;s so-so on the private hairs. I still use my electric razor to finish off the nose hairs that this unit can&#x27;t cut - it&#x27;s usually the tiny, coarse hairs that&#x27;s close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Some people didn&#x27;t like their trimmer and I can understand why. It&#x27;s not something that you want to drop. I clean it under water all the time and it has never malfunctioned like another user stated. The cut hairs remain in the nostril so you can see that it does it&#x27;s job fairly well when you use a tissue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other nose trimmers, all of them have sucked for one reason or another, mostly their blades would fall out of some other mechanical function would fail, but I&#x27;ve never had one that was as unpleasant to use as this one.  It literally PULLS the hairs as it attempts to cut them, so either the blade is too dull or not spinning fast enough to truly cut the hairs cleanly.  It was so painful I only used it once and we returned it to Amazon for a return.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my 10-year old panasonic trimmer.  I&#x27;m very dissapointed.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but it can&#x27;t get at the hairs to cut them.</li>
    <li> Regardless of the fact that the trimmer is labeled for both wet and dry use, it works better under dry conditions.</li>
    <li> I bought this approx. eight months ago because at the time, the reviews seemed pretty good, I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything particularly expensive and the fact that it was flexible seemed somewhat appealing.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, I tried it out (I only used it for my ears) and it seemed to work fairly well. Nothing great, but if you stuck with it, it finally got the job done. I found that the fact that it bent in the middle was totally unnecessary (to me) and the fact that the entire body was sort of a cheap plastic and not metal made it seem somewhat cheap, but since I only planned to use it about once a month for five minutes or so and this wasn&#x27;t exactly a major purchase, at $8.00, you get what you pay for. It was no more or less important than a toothbrush. As long as it worked o.k., that&#x27;s all I cared about, until...&lt;br /&gt;...About a week ago, I had the trimmer sitting upright on the sink after I used it and when I reached for something, I accidentally knocked it into the sink, which was my fault. Keep in mind I didn&#x27;t knock it three or four feet onto the floor, it just slid into the sink where it knocked into the sink drain. The entire on/off switch mechanism flew all over the place like a jack in the box, including the switch (plastic), the few pieces (plastic) that hold it down and operate the &#x27;dial&#x27; that rotates it on or off and part of that &#x27;dial&#x27; mechanism (plastic) too. The pieces went everywhere and I gathered everything up that I could find and tried to put it together, but I think one of the small &#x27;holding&#x27; pieces must have gone down the drain, because I spent about a half hour, all for naught.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made in China (the modern day equivalent of &#x27;Made in Japan&#x27; of decades ago) and it lives down to its reputation. I looked up the instruction sheet and it said it had a two year warranty, EXCEPT against accident, dropping, breaking, misuse, abuse, ad infinitum (in other words, just about everything in the world).&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking about calling up and lying and saying the switch just popped off when I attempted to turn it on, but even if they said o.k., by the time you pack it up, go to the P.O., pay for the shipping (you pay) and then wait until you get old before you get it back just wasn&#x27;t worth it for the original 8 bucks. &lt;br /&gt;This is the third Remington product I&#x27;ve ditched because it&#x27;s gone bad quickly (shaver, beard trimmer and this) because the company&#x27;s never been the same since Victor Kiam (&amp;quot;I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.&amp;quot;) died and the family sold it to Rayovac (the battery maker) for about $500 million (lucky them).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting the Panasonic ER411NC instead and give that a try. I&#x27;ve bought the Norelco beard trimmer and the Sanyo electric razor and they&#x27;re both way better than their Remington counterparts and they LAST. Hopefully, the Panasonic will do the same.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll NEVER buy another Remington product again (Rayovac&#x27;s batteries always stunk anyway, so why should any of their other stuff be any better?)...</li>
    <li> I bought this NE-3 Precision rotary trimmer expecting to get the rotary head I saw some years ago from Remington. Unfortunatelly the one I received has rotary blades under a fixed head, not nice design head, and definitelly not doing the job I was expecting to do. &lt;br /&gt;For this reazon, I&#x27;m waiting \\&quot;papers\\&quot; to get my money back, hopefully not very long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Fathers&#x27;Day gift for my husband with some concern about the previous reviews. This worked well for him, but I did caution him not to use it in water. He likes it! :)</li>
    <li> Mine stoped dead after 7 or 8 uses.</li>
    <li> It seems to do its job very well. I especially like the flexible body. No problems to report.</li>
    <li> It does an okay job of cutting nose hair. Uses little battery power. However, the on-off switch broke after 2 years of use. It just came off and I cannot reinstall it.</li>
    <li> We could not get this razor to work.  It felt nice hand held but wouldn&#x27;t work...even after changing batteries 3 times. &lt;BR&gt;I returned this and am looking for an acknowledgment and refund.&lt;BR&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> The trimmer wouldn&#x27;t run untill I sharply banged on my counter top. Then when I used it,it felt like is was ripping the hair out instead of cutting it.It was painfull. Fine ear hair is no problem. Coarse nose hair get ready for some pain!</li>
    <li> I have owned 13 trimmers and this is by far the best trimmer on the market.  Usually when I trim my nose or ears, the hair grows back after several days, but the NE-3 will last two weeks!  Ergonomically speaking, it is especially well designed and light weight.  My wrist has never never gotten tired during one of my trimming marathons. I would prefer it was available in designer colors, but don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying it.  Happy trimming!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer two years ago. It&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t work but it&#x27;s just a pain in the neck. The on/off switch keeps falling off. Sometimes it just makes too much noise but hardly trims, and it consumes batteries too fast. I bought another \\&quot;famous\\&quot; brand name trimmer. I won&#x27;t mention the name, so that you won&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m trying to undermine this product by promoting another one. But please, don&#x27;t buy this product, unless you like to have a bad nose hair day!</li>
    <li> You know, I used to have a problem with ear hair.  And I&#x27;m not just talking about your standard run of the mill ear fuzz we see in senior citizens.  No sir, I&#x27;m talking about crazy jungle ear hair.  The stuff would grow like wildfire and I was constantly fighting a losing battle against it.  I had about given up and was going to try an experimental laser surgery process to remove the unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;That is, until I discovered the Remington NE-3 Precision Wet/Dry Rotary Nose &amp;amp; Ear Trimmer.  This fine piece of machinery is an absolute godsend!  It has a wizard-like ability to get into the various nooks and crannies that span from deep within the canal all the way out to the pinna!  Personally, I especially had problems with very coarse hair growing on my anvil, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a fantastic piece, and definitely a great gift for the holidays!  Arrivederci ear fuzz!</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t have too much nose or ear hair, because in 6 months I couldn&#x27;t find one hair to clean from this thing. But again it makes some noise and sometimes it seems to cut something. I shouldn&#x27;t mention that I still didn&#x27;t figure out what part of the tip is suposed to cut hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my dad and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;BR&gt;The one at Brookstone&#x27;s is the best but costly.</li>
    <li> The light-weight trimmer can flex in the middle for an ergonomic, comfortable fit (the body is plastic, not metal). It operates pretty quietly and smoothly compared to others I have owned. Unfortunately a hair or two is still yanked out by the root once in a while. The motor gets hot within 2-3 minutes of continuous use, so you may need to take a short break between nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained that the product doesn&#x27;t neatly collect hair deposits -- that&#x27;s because it is a trimmer afterall, and not an electric shaver! For the most effective trimming insert hairs directly into the trimmer. You won&#x27;t be able to cut much by running the side of the trimmer tip along the sides of the nostrils. When cleaning remember to rinse only the tip (don&#x27;t dunk the whole thing in the sink or use it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW UPDATE&lt;BR&gt;The power switch area, not being well made, has detached from the unit after three uses. Under the plastic switch are two tiny, unfastened components that help activate the battery power. I lost one of these plastic pieces when the switch fell off. The switch snapped back into place but now the switch has to constantly be pushed in order to operate. I originally rated the product as four stars, but this is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> As a trimmer, the NE-3 functions beautifully: after a year of biweekly use I have never once felt the discomfort of an unpleasantly pulled hair.  However, as a device the NE-3 is not particularly sturdy: after a year&#x27;s use, and maybe most the life of the battery, the on-off switch ceased to function.  For a while I could get it to run by pressing the on/off switch into the trimmer case, but now even that&#x27;s stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re willing to pay $8 for a razor that will likely break after a year&#x27;s use then this is an outstanding razor to get; if you want one that will last you, then--like me--begin to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I like it so far. It&#x27;s safe and that&#x27;s what I like about it, no pinching or pulling.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say other than the product does not work.  Will not trim anything.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job and is super fast too, no excuse for unsightly hairs hanging out anymore ;)</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these only to have it fall apart within a month. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t drop it! The cutter head assembly fell right off and wouldn&#x27;t snap securely back on like it should. The plastic construction makes this unit relatively inexpensive at the cost of it&#x27;s durability.</li>
    <li> This product is simply not worth using at any price.  It did not cut any of the hairs I needed it to cut. It felt like a dime store trinket. Why I would need to use it wet is beyond me, but some might appreciate that feature.  I&#x27;m also not sure why it&#x27;s flexible.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should have some sort of quality control mechanism to keep products like this \\&quot;off their shelves.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Just received this Trimmer, never used one before and was excited to use it ...... Built well and looks sleek and innovative !  Price paid was simply a deal ....... Seems to work okay, the rotary blade tip seems small to me, takes a while to cut ?  Maybe it is me, but it is worth giving this a try .....</li>
    <li> This razor did the job well, but the switch came off in my hand within the first five minutes of using it.  Does not speak well of its long term use, I&#x27;d say...</li>
    <li> I bought this product from a local store because I could not find the Panasonic product.  This Remington product allows you to bend, but it does not trim.  I wish I could assign negative stars to this product.  This product did not trim a single strand of hair.  Beware....</li>
    <li> Easy to hold,easy to adjust,easy to clean,comfortable to use, no hair pulling, good price, good gift, good Amazon item....You got to have one!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, no painful yanking of hairs, does the job efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is embarassing to write a review about a nose hair trimmer.  It is not, however, half as embarassing as walking around with rampaging nose hairs. To all those who silently suffer from this problem -- stop using scissors and get a trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, blow nose before use.  Batteries not included.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer about 4 years ago here on Amazon.com, and it has finally given up.  I will be receiving my new one in the mail tomorrow.  This trimmer does everything it is suppose to do. ENOUGH SAID! Hygiene is a personal thing.</li>
    <li> I purchase my Remington NE3 in 33 months ago.  It trimmed nose and ear hair but took a long time to do a thorough job.  It also seemed to leak battery charge because if I left the battery inside the unit, it was discharged the next week.  So I always removed the battery.  Finally the device would no longer turn on.  I&#x27;m sure the switch was defective because at first I could make it run by pushing the switch towards the on position, but this procedure only worked once or twice.  I liked the product for the low price, but it&#x27;s disappointing that it didn&#x27;t last any longer, considering that I used it only about once a month.  I think this experience illustrates the terrible quality of things made in China (I assume this was made in China, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s crummy.  I have also recently purchased other small electronic products made in China, and they are also unsatisfactory).  Let&#x27;s start making products in the USA, where we know how to make them right!!!</li>
    <li> Betterthan the panasonic. Due to funky genes i grow hair out of my nose at an incredible rate. One of the greatest inventions of the late 20th century ;-)</li>
    <li> Although it says its a wet/dry device, it is NOT! I rinsed it under the sink and the next day it would not turn on. To my dismay when I opened up the battery compartment, a bunch of water gushed out!! The whole device was full of water and useless.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer and it&#x27;s a great price. The trimmer does not require much maintenance, does a good job and the battery life is great.</li>
