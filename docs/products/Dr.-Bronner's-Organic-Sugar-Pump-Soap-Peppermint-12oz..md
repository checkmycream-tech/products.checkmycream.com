      <li>I love the smell of peppermint in a soap.  </li>
      <li>They love it.  </li>
      <li>Not my favorite of Dr Bronners items.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I reminded them to wash the soap off better and that helps.</li>
      <li>I love this soap and so do people who come over, some of my family members say it stays too &#x27;sticky&#x27; on your hands at times, I do not find this though.</li>
      <li>Love their products.</li>
      <li>If you have ever used Dr. Bronner soaps, you&#x27;re already in love.  </li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t buy again since it pales in comparison to my longtime favorite.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this soap.</li>
      <li>Love, love,love this soap.</li>
      <li>I love that is organic.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and love the cleaning power.</li>
      <li>I love the smell (why cant Dr. Bronners do more with Spearmint???).</li>
      <li>After trying dozens and dozens of hand soaps, this one is our favorite.</li>
      <li>But ok.</li>
      <li>I love the very clean feeling my hands are after this soap.</li>
      <li>Smells great and cleans effectively but left a film in my sink.</li>
      <li>and so you can reuse it easily.  </li>
      <li>This soap has the best scent and makes you feel very clean without being over-drying or harsh.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product as always.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thicker than the original Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps</li>
      <li>My face never has felt so clean</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
      <li>and it has a perfect light fragrance that is neither male or female type of scent.</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
      <li>Totally go for the exhilarating Spearmint Peppermint scent.</li>
      <li>It leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny and then some.</li>
      <li>Not only is there such a cool story behind these products, they also work great and smell great!  </li>
      <li>It has a great small.</li>
      <li>Nice smell but strange color.  </li>
      <li>This stuff smells so great and last a long time.</li>
      <li>We find using a 1/2 plunger push of soap is more than enough for a hand washing.</li>
      <li>This smells pleasant but not overwhelming, like mint gum.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather too much, just enough and leaves hands feeling very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>The color was brownish and not very appealing although the smell was nice.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much soap to lather well either.  </li>
      <li>It does not lather much.  </li>
      <li>I like it so much I will probably buy the lotion too.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in my head or real</li>
      <li>It lathered nicely and the biggest side effect is it seems to be kicking the blank out of my dry skin.</li>
      <li>So much better than your typical store brand stuff.</li>
      <li>Decent sized bottle too.</li>
      <li>They use high quality organic products that have nothing toxic in it.</li>
      <li>It actually FEELS CLEAN which sometimes is lost on natural products.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to smells and a lot of scents</li>
      <li>The scent is mild and natural, and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out at all.</li>
      <li>Great soap -- once you start using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, it&#x27;s difficult to go back to &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; that leaves a film on you.</li>
      <li>Buyers beware if you are even the slightest bit sensitive.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have to scan every ingredient to make sure there is nothing that will potentially make me or my family sick.</li>
      <li>The only thing that might be off-putting to some is the natural brownish color.</li>
      <li>Clean rinsing, even in hard water</li>
      <li>It goes on a little bit thick and sticky, but it lathers up really nice.</li>

    <li> I love the smell (why cant Dr. Bronners do more with Spearmint???). but the soap does leave your hands somewhat &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or maybe just dried out.  I&#x27;ve had it a week now and use it daily but cant figure out if my hands feel sticky or just dried out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product.  http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/dr-bronner-s-crazy-ass-magic-soap-labels-18606</li>
    <li> Fantastic product as always.</li>
    <li> I LOVE DR BRONNERS! This soap has the best scent and makes you feel very clean without being over-drying or harsh. Totally go for the exhilarating Spearmint Peppermint scent.</li>

There is a little bit of a weird smell to this soap and it also is very drying, in my experience.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again since it pales in comparison to my longtime favorite.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap. I love that is organic. I wish it was in a glass container though!  It doesn&#x27;t lather too much, just enough and leaves hands feeling very fresh and clean. I would buy again if it was packaged in glass.</li>
    <li> This hand soap has a sugar base, and provides tons of lather without chemicals &amp; foaming agents like SLS. The scent is mild and natural, and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out at all. The only thing that might be off-putting to some is the natural brownish color. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, though.</li>
    <li> Great soap -- once you start using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, it&#x27;s difficult to go back to &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; that leaves a film on you. The Spearmint &amp; Peppermint scent is excellent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Smells good and feels nice.  Doesn&#x27;t take much soap to lather well either.  Nice complement to the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar of soap in the tub.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in my head or real but it seems like my skin has been less dry since using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.</li>
    <li> Loved the soap. Creamy, doesn&#x27;t leave hands dry.</li>
    <li> It goes on a little bit thick and sticky, but it lathers up really nice. Really nice peppermint smell, didnt find it overwhelming. Decent sized bottle too.</li>
    <li> After trying dozens and dozens of hand soaps, this one is our favorite. TIP: We find using a 1/2 plunger push of soap is more than enough for a hand washing.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Bronner&#x27;s soap for a while now and I have to say this is great stuff. It&#x27;s thicker than the original Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps so I doesn&#x27;t go all over the place when you get it out of a dispenser to wash your hands with. It smells great too! I am very sensitive to smells and a lot of scents either make me wheeze (I have asthma and allergies) or give me a headache. This smells pleasant but not overwhelming, like mint gum. I like it so much I will probably buy the lotion too. Bronner&#x27;s is one of the only companies that I actually trust. They use high quality organic products that have nothing toxic in it. They use fair trade ingredients and give away most of their profits. It&#x27;s nice to not have to scan every ingredient to make sure there is nothing that will potentially make me or my family sick. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love, love,love this soap. It smells amazing and works well.</li>
    <li> If you have ever used Dr. Bronner soaps, you&#x27;re already in love.  Not only is there such a cool story behind these products, they also work great and smell great!  I am constantly asked where I got this soap.  The container is also of good quality and so you can reuse it easily.  As they state, you can use this hand soap for other things.  Once you use one of these products, you will be hooked on all of his others.</li>
    <li> I love the very clean feeling my hands are after this soap. It actually FEELS CLEAN which sometimes is lost on natural products.</li>
    <li> So much better than your typical store brand stuff. Clean rinsing, even in hard water and it has a perfect light fragrance that is neither male or female type of scent. It lathered nicely and the biggest side effect is it seems to be kicking the blank out of my dry skin. Worth every penny and then some.</li>
    <li> I leaves this in the guest bathroom.  When they come out, wiping and smelling their hands, I like to watch the expression of their faces.  They love it.  I love the smell of peppermint in a soap.  It leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Love love the scent and how it feels when I&#x27;m washing my hand!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so great and last a long time. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Got this for my Mom.  She likes it alot</li>
    <li> Love the smell and love the cleaning power. Love their products.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and so do people who come over, some of my family members say it stays too &#x27;sticky&#x27; on your hands at times, I do not find this though. Someone in my family never seems to wash it all off their hands though and it gets on the faucet handle and then it gets sticky. I reminded them to wash the soap off better and that helps. I love the smell! I&#x27;d buy again and have! Good price online too!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this soap. It has a great small.</li>
    <li> Nice smell but strange color.  It does not lather much.  The color was brownish and not very appealing although the smell was nice.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite of Dr Bronners items. But ok.</li>
    <li> I bought two... One for me and one for my mom. We had used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products years and years ago and loved them. After about one week of use, I noticed my hands were red, dry, and sore and it occurred to me that there might be a connection. I called my mom and she reported the very same experience. So sad... The soap had to go. Sorry, Dr. Bronner. I demand a lot from my hand soap and something in this soap is a definite irritant. Buyers beware if you are even the slightest bit sensitive.</li>
    <li> Most wonderful Soap I have ever used, I completely sold. Used to use expensive face wash from my big department stores. My face never has felt so clean then when I use the Bonner Soap A+A+A+</li>
    <li> Great stuff but leaves a coating in my sink.</li>
    <li> Smells great and cleans effectively but left a film in my sink. Will not repurchase for this reason only.</li>
    <li> Perfectly scented and premium hand soap that meet your needs and more</li>
    <li> I like this soap and I use it in the kitchen.  It cuts grease well for my hands, and I feel like it cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, I like the smell, and it is good for the environment.  It is a brown liquid, gel, and I would buy it again.</li>
