      <li>I wish someone could tell me what the popular fragrance is that is in EVERYTHING and smells like Raid.  </li>

      <li>I love</li>

      <li>The product does what it says: it leaves my hair looking thicker and with more texture.</li>
      <li>Great price as well (even though it sold for $5.74 just a couple months ago) -- HIGHLY recommended!</li>
      <li>Price makes it even better.</li>
      <li>More people should know about this stuff.</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
      <li>It washes away very clean.  </li>
      <li>I like this paste and FX Surf Head because they wash out easily.</li>
      <li>You can rinse it off your hands easily with no funky residue, and it holds all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many pastes and waxes and this one is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
      <li>This is fantastic stuff</li>
      <li>ORIGINAL (9/7/2014)</li>
      <li>It works really well and makes me feel better knowing that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to work with, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky, and I don&#x27;t need to use very much for it to set my hair how I want it.</li>
      <li>:) I did have to pay a bit more than the store to get it shipped to me, but it&#x27;s well worth the extra expense.</li>
      <li>Too thick at first, added some water over night and now it&#x27;s perfect now.</li>
      <li>It might be better on pretty short hair, but I&#x27;m not cutting this weave just to have it work better; you know?</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural but am searching for another product as this one seems to leave my hair looking more shiny when I like the matte look.</li>
      <li>It not only makes your hair feel thicker, but gives a nice control.</li>
      <li>I finally figured out that hair paste works the best for what I want out of my hair - something that doesn&#x27;t leave much of a wet look but that also holds it in place.</li>
      <li>I will certainly be sticking with this for life!</li>
      <li>This product is even pretty good as 2nd-day hair with little to do to restyle.</li>
      <li>Smells great, and doesnt give you that hard crusty look.</li>
      <li>On top of that, it&#x27;s pretty much double</li>
      <li>which after much frustration, I discovered it here on Amazon...or Amazin&#x27; as I like to call them since I think they have just about everything except moon dust!</li>
      <li>Not only is it cheap, it holds great while not feeling &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; or stiff.  </li>
      <li>Provides a superior hold but doesn&#x27;t become stiff.</li>
      <li>this is a great product as it doesnt work very well with long or short hair.</li>
      <li>Too much water and your hair gets too wet, so it takes a little fiddling to get it perfect.</li>
      <li>and it works very well.  </li>
      <li>The hold will stay and you&#x27;ll have a very full/thick mane.</li>
      <li>It also holds your hair in place without too much stiffness.  </li>
      <li>Try it you will really like it.</li>
      <li>trying to reduce as much toxins from household and care products as possible….</li>
      <li>If you really want a product to specifically leave your hair looking thicker and textured then this is for you.</li>
      <li>Live the fact that I can pretty much use this my way.</li>
      <li>Way better than gel, because it doesn&#x27;t get dry or crusty, it feels very natural.</li>
      <li>I know it is listed for men, but my wife loves it and although she has tried many other hair products to increase volume, this is the one.</li>
      <li>I tried this paste again after luckily finding one left at a Walmart (FYI, this was discontinued by OGX).</li>
      <li>This is very similar but more fragrant and definitely a male fragrance.</li>
      <li>I already have pretty thick black hair, so can&#x27;t comment on that, but it definitely adds volume and superb shine.</li>
      <li>It is in so many popular perfumes and colognes it is nearly impossible to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Got this on a whim, and it is my new go to product.  </li>
      <li>natural</li>
      <li>Made with natural ingredients, it never dries out my hair, or leaves it greasy or &amp;#34;gunked&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Smell is nice but very subtle.</li>
      <li>I have thin straight hair and have always had trouble finding a good hair product.</li>
      <li>Usually I let it dry and then comb it again, which takes out the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look and makes it appear more natural.</li>
      <li>I probably only use, at most, a dime&#x27;s size amount on wet hair and let my hair dry naturally (no use of a blow dryer which would probably ruin the results).</li>
      <li>I think this container was old or sitting around as I had purchased the last one.</li>

<li> A nickel-sized amount was enough for some medium-strong hold and looks semi matte in dried hair or a little sleek with slightly damp hair.</li>
<li> My wife had me buy this, after we found it hard to find in local stores.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely a thicker feeling paste and has a subtle, minty scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff! Wal-Mart stopped carrying it so I had to order it here. Provides a superior hold but doesn&#x27;t become stiff. Has a pleasant, earthy citrus scent. Great price as well (even though it sold for $5.74 just a couple months ago) -- HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> no complaints….just a great organic hair styling product…. trying to reduce as much toxins from household and care products as possible….</li>
    <li> Great product, I keep my hair medium length and use this product.  It keeps it tight enough but flexible.  Ordering it through the subscribe and save program saved me a good amount of money versus buying it in the store.  It smells great if you keep a medium amount of hair on your head this is a great product as it doesnt work very well with long or short hair.</li>
    <li> Very good thickening paste</li>
    <li> This stuff flakes off in humidity.</li>
    <li> This was part of a purchase that included OGX thickening shampoo and conditioner. I used once and it definitely works.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of hair products - and I really mean all kinds, from hair gel to hair paste to hair spray, etc. I finally figured out that hair paste works the best for what I want out of my hair - something that doesn&#x27;t leave much of a wet look but that also holds it in place. My hair is waivy/curly so when I style it and use something that doesn&#x27;t hold, it curls up. This stuff keeps it in place without it feeling nasty! On top of that, it&#x27;s pretty much double the .oz of any Axe hair product but not double the price. I will certainly be sticking with this for life! (Or until my hair falls out) Super happy!</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, flakey, or stiff.  I bought 3 at once and I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> This item was extra sticky and less manageable than I expected. I used this brand before and had better flow and spreadability in my hair. I have also used the OGX Mens Beach Paste and very satisfied. I think this container was old or sitting around as I had purchased the last one.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural but am searching for another product as this one seems to leave my hair looking more shiny when I like the matte look.</li>
    <li> I wish someone could tell me what the popular fragrance is that is in EVERYTHING and smells like Raid.  It makes me physically ill and if I could identify it maybe I could avoid it.  It is in so many popular perfumes and colognes it is nearly impossible to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot detect any hint of mint or citrus, all I can smell is bug spray.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff to use to style my hair, and after using it I will never go back to using gel/pomade. It makes your hair really thick but doesn&#x27;t get hard or wear off. Really good stuff and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out ether. Try it you will really like it. Smell is nice but very subtle.</li>
    <li> Great product! Absolutely love using it. Smells great, and doesnt give you that hard crusty look.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this product when looking in a store for another I formerly preferred. They didn&#x27;t have what I was looking for but they did have this paste. I thought I&#x27;d give it a go and am I ever happy I found it! It&#x27;s easy to work with, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky, and I don&#x27;t need to use very much for it to set my hair how I want it. Now, the reason I&#x27;m rating it here is because that store now doesn&#x27;t carry this product anymore...or the one I&#x27;d been looking for when I came across this, either. So I went hunting online...which after much frustration, I discovered it here on Amazon...or Amazin&#x27; as I like to call them since I think they have just about everything except moon dust! :) I did have to pay a bit more than the store to get it shipped to me, but it&#x27;s well worth the extra expense. This is fantastic stuff and I&#x27;d recommend it to any guy wanting an effective, pleasant-smelling, and non-sticky product.</li>
    <li> I have been using FX Surf Head paste for years but have been unable to find it locally in stores (Walgreens used to carry it).  I purchased this from an Amazon suggestion.  This is very similar but more fragrant and definitely a male fragrance. I like this paste and FX Surf Head because they wash out easily.</li>
    <li> Great product! provides a firm hold without the side effects of using gel. Smells great too and easy to wash off at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> UPDATE (3/27/2015): I tried this paste again after luckily finding one left at a Walmart (FYI, this was discontinued by OGX). I realized I was using it all wrong! If you use this paste w/o adding a sprinkle of water to it, applying it will feel like you&#x27;re pulling your hair out. It&#x27;s pretty tough stuff. However, I added a sprinkle of water to the paste and rubbed it through my palms and into my hair evenly, and the hold was excellent. It held all day and night without problem. If you want a very dry matte look, just run a comb through your hair after it&#x27;s applied or blow dry your hair for a few. The hold will stay and you&#x27;ll have a very full/thick mane. This product is even pretty good as 2nd-day hair with little to do to restyle. Sadly it&#x27;s discontinued, but even at the higher price found on Amazon it&#x27;s still worth buying (especially the 4oz value vs other 2oz products).   ORIGINAL (9/7/2014): This product works well but it&#x27;s just not for me. It&#x27;s definitely a thicker feeling paste and has a subtle, minty scent. The product does what it says: it leaves my hair looking thicker and with more texture. A nickel-sized amount was enough for some medium-strong hold and looks semi matte in dried hair or a little sleek with slightly damp hair. If you really want a product to specifically leave your hair looking thicker and textured then this is for you. I&#x27;d also recommend OGX Morrocan Surf Paste (feels softer, more matte finish, medium hold).</li>
    <li> Live the fact that I can pretty much use this my way. Can hold for hours and still wake up with great look. I recommend it for guys wanting a thick look or guys that have thicker hair makes it look thinner(kinda weird but true). B</li>
    <li> This is not the same product sold in US stores.</li>
    <li> The store I usually buy this at stopped carrying it, so I purchased the last 6 in stock on Amazon. Hopefully more come in so the rest of you can experience how great this stuff is. It&#x27;s strong, but not overly horrible feeling hold. You can rinse it off your hands easily with no funky residue, and it holds all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it smells great. Do yourself a favor.</li>
    <li> Provides texture and thickness to my hair, just what I was looking for and needed.</li>
    <li> My wife had me buy this, after we found it hard to find in local stores.  She swears by it. I know it is listed for men, but my wife loves it and although she has tried many other hair products to increase volume, this is the one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many pastes and waxes and this one is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Not only is it cheap, it holds great while not feeling &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; or stiff.  It washes away very clean.  Its not too shiny and gives great texture!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Organix Mens Thickening paste. I use to use Redkin, Axe and a variety of other products for my hair. I always felt that they left too much residue or left a bad smell to my hair at the end of the day. With the Organix Mens product I have the hair support that I like and don&#x27;t feel yucky by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I used to use the axe paste but was more expensive and contained less product until I found&lt;br /&gt;OGX Mens Texturizing Paste I love it keeps my hair in place without a greasy or crunchy feel</li>
    <li> Best hair paste their is.</li>
    <li> Too thick at first, added some water over night and now it&#x27;s perfect now. I already have pretty thick black hair, so can&#x27;t comment on that, but it definitely adds volume and superb shine. Way better than gel, because it doesn&#x27;t get dry or crusty, it feels very natural.</li>
    <li> natural and it works very well.  My hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I have spent hundreds on hair care products over the past few years, across all price points.  I have been looking for a paste / cream that offered texture, control, and hold, but didn&#x27;t dry my hair our, or make it too difficult to manage.  Got this on a whim, and it is my new go to product.  Made with natural ingredients, it never dries out my hair, or leaves it greasy or &amp;#34;gunked&amp;#34; up.  Smells great and clean, and is easy to use.  Price makes it even better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nice! It&#x27;s really thick, so putting it on can be difficult. I usually scoop some out on my finger, smear it on my other palm and rub my hands together. Then add a little sprinkle of tap water and rub together before applying to my head, otherwise it&#x27;s like putting actual paste in your hair and it feels like you&#x27;re pulling your hair out. Too much water and your hair gets too wet, so it takes a little fiddling to get it perfect. It DOES make my hair appear thicker. Usually I let it dry and then comb it again, which takes out the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look and makes it appear more natural. Also, it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> More people should know about this stuff. It not only makes your hair feel thicker, but gives a nice control. I choose it over pomade.</li>
    <li> Thickens while it shapes. Only a touch does the trick. Not pasty, heavy, or gummy. Tried lots of them. This is, by far, the best.</li>
    <li> It might be better on pretty short hair, but I&#x27;m not cutting this weave just to have it work better; you know?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m amazed at the results.  It states on the jar that it&#x27;s \\&quot;thickening\\&quot;.  This is very accurate.  At my age I&#x27;m having thinning hair and this product does an amazing job at countering that.  It also holds your hair in place without too much stiffness.  A little goes a long way.  I probably only use, at most, a dime&#x27;s size amount on wet hair and let my hair dry naturally (no use of a blow dryer which would probably ruin the results).</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I have thin straight hair and have always had trouble finding a good hair product. It works really well and makes me feel better knowing that it&#x27;s organic. As long as I have hair, I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again and again!</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
</ol>
