      <li>Bought Norelco razor for $40 and am getting the best shave</li>
      <li>Both foil and blade snapped into place perfectly.</li>

      <li>Delivered on time and in excellent condition.  </li>

      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>The foil is amazing.</li>

      <li>okay.</li>

      <li>I have been using this electric razor for many years.  </li>

      <li>Wishing you many close shaves {*</li>
      <li>The use of deleted spare parts that make functional the old electric fixture is good to the environment, we must avoid to drop to the garbage items in good working condition</li>
      <li>and no, I don&#x27;t work for or repair shavers :)</li>
      <li>, generaly works ok.</li>
      <li>But getting better now.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was really just looking for something to get me by between blade shaves, but have been pretty impressed with this replacement set.</li>
      <li>Ordered these after the foil tore on my original (and gave me a permanant scar!)  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this toiletry item for many years and it suits me just fine.  </li>
      <li>After reading reviews, I realized that foil should work (most reviews indicate accurately that cutters don&#x27;t work for Braun Cruzer).</li>
      <li>Better than original.</li>
      <li>I thought it&#x27;s easy to try it than return it</li>
      <li>the holes are too close and the hair cant go thru as easily.</li>
      <li>Foil works fine</li>
      <li>The part number is correct,and the model I have is listed as one that it will fit, and the screen fits fine.</li>
      <li>Although it does fit the Cruzer razor, the photo is NOT of the one that is shipped.  </li>
      <li>Fit my Braun 1000 series well.</li>
      <li>it still didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>I would rather take an extra couple minutes to shave, than cut my face up, so I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
      <li>it fit just like</li>
      <li>The plastic piece is not designed to fit this razor.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my razor as advertised</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as great an improvement as I had hoped for; although I definitely did notice a difference.</li>
      <li>this time the parts fit.</li>
      <li>If you do buy this product for any of the shavers it claims to fit, be sure to try it out right away, before the &amp;#34;return window&amp;#34; closes.</li>
      <li>Foil doesn&#x27;t seem to fit as closely as original.  </li>
      <li>New foil seems to lift my beard better, so I get a better shave than with the original.  </li>
      <li>Product thicker than original.</li>
      <li>The original foil had &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; holes in it.</li>
      <li>There are lots of reviews stating the replacement blade and screen don&#x27;t match the original.  </li>
      <li>Ordered another set from original manufacturer...same.  </li>
      <li>This is not an original replacement.</li>
      <li>this is not the original style that came with the razor.</li>
      <li>Shave doesn&#x27;t feel as close as original foil &amp; cutter.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for providing replacement parts for a Braun razor that I&#x27;ve had for many years and really enjoy using.  </li>
      <li>Shaves better than old original, but not as good as new.</li>
      <li>Now I have a new foil, but I realize that a new cutter would have been effective, and I&#x27;m happy that apart from this replacement, I also bought a new shaver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d had a hard time finding the replacement foil and cutter for it and then found it on here for a great price!</li>
      <li>Thoroughly pleased with the whole experience.</li>
      <li>Glad to have ready access to replacement foils &amp; cutters.  </li>
      <li>Very well pleased with it</li>
      <li>I guess that could be a good thing - the blades on the cutters really do last!</li>
      <li>The item arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I would say that shaves aren&#x27;t quite as close as the original, but it IS better than using an old Braun foil.</li>
      <li>The razor now works like brand new, maybe even better, because the foil seems to have an updated design that seems to allow me to get a closer shave.    </li>
      <li>Foil part fits fine, metal part is stronger than old style, which has been a problem, blade piece didn&#x27;t fit my razor.</li>
      <li>The old worn one cut better.</li>
      <li>my case the original razor I had was bent and the screen had a hole in it, thanks to baggage check</li>
      <li>but it is not a complete match for the Braun razor I own.  </li>
      <li>I have been using my Braun razor for years now, and like it very much.</li>
      <li>so much for the environment!</li>
      <li>No break in and only has gotten better with each shave (used about 5 times now).</li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s exactly what happened.</li>
      <li>My old, worn out cutter and  foil works better than this new one</li>
      <li>The replacement foil and cutter to fit my Braun Cruzer arrived quickly and undamaged (I actually bought 2 sets).</li>
      <li>Blades and screen nowhere near original comfort and effectiveness.  </li>
      <li>The original foil on my Cruzer 4 cracked and was getting old</li>
      <li>any way this one popped right on and worked the color is off which is not too much of a problem as I normally don&#x27;t put my shaver on display in the living room.</li>
      <li>The foil hole pattern is exactly the same as my original Braun</li>
      <li>All in all a pretty decent purchase, will buy again when the two I bought wear out.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit as advertised for my Braun Cruzer but provides a very disappointing shave.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good!.God Bless.Jesus Loves You.</li>
    <li> Fits my Braun Cruzr perfectly, it is as pictured but the picture looks kind of flattened so I was concerned it may not be the correct one but it is!  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> this time the parts fit. did not use them yet</li>
    <li> Blades and screen nowhere near original comfort and effectiveness.  Returned them. Ordered another set from original manufacturer...same.  Bought Norelco razor for $40 and am getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  And it rinses out, with the screen and blades just flipping out on their hinge...no tricky removal and brush cleaning.  I do it every day and it&#x27;s miles ahead of the Braun razor for just about everything.  There are lots of reviews stating the replacement blade and screen don&#x27;t match the original.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> Foil works fine but it is not a complete match for the Braun razor I own.  Seems to work perfectly well and i don&#x27;t mind the color mismatch at all.  We&#x27;ll see it if holds up over the next few weeks.  Only problem I have is that a $7.95 shipping charge is outrageous.  It is a very small, lightweight package that you could mail for $1.49 at your local post office.</li>
    <li> very pleased with my purchase-fit perfect</li>
    <li> This is not an original replacement. The foil is different from the original. The shave is not as good as with the original foil, but for the price it is fairly good.</li>
    <li> The foil is very suitale to my Braun Cruzer 2675.  But the cutter is not well, can&#x27;t shave clearly.  I almost satisfied with the goods, because I just want to buy a new foil to replace my old bad foil.  Obviously it is.</li>
    <li> I have been using this electric razor for many years.  It gives a reliable, close shave.  The replacement foil and cutter  I replace about  once a year.  I also purchased one for my father.</li>
    <li> Horrible foil and cutter!  I thought it was a Braun replacement part but doesn&#x27;t appear to be.  My old, worn out cutter and  foil works better than this new one</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and cutter to fit my Braun Cruzer arrived quickly and undamaged (I actually bought 2 sets). I have been using my Braun razor for years now, and like it very much. Last time the foil got damaged, I went to a local appliance store and paid $$ for the replacement parts. This time I ordered from Amazon and got two sets, shipped, for less than I paid for one at the local brick-n-mortar store.    The razor now works like brand new, maybe even better, because the foil seems to have an updated design that seems to allow me to get a closer shave.    So, don&#x27;t throw out your old electric razor when the foil gets a hole in it, or the cutter gets dull. Just have a new set delivered to your door step!</li>
    <li> Although it does fit the Cruzer razor, the photo is NOT of the one that is shipped.  The foil shipped is for maintaining a three-day growth appearance and not a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Better than original. No break in and only has gotten better with each shave (used about 5 times now).</li>
    <li> Everything worked out great.  The package came in the mail within a few days and the parts work as hoped. I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. IT&#x27;S 11 BUCKS FOR A REASON. IT DONT CUT. DULL. VERY DULL. I HAVE SHORT RAZOR STUBBLE AND IT WONT CUT IT. useless... save your money... it&#x27;s a generic product and is horrible.</li>
    <li> I had been using the same foil/cutter for a good few years before I finally decided to order a replacement. I was expecting a big change in the closeness of my shave. It wasn&#x27;t as great an improvement as I had hoped for; although I definitely did notice a difference. I guess that could be a good thing - the blades on the cutters really do last!</li>
    <li> Great price for a replacement shaver foil. Fit my Braun 1000 series well. Not Braun brand but works well enough. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit and is not original</li>
    <li> The items arrived promptly and were just as described.  I need this specific set for my Braun shaver.  I&#x27;ve had this toiletry item for many years and it suits me just fine.  Glad to have ready access to replacement foils &amp; cutters.  THANKS!</li>
    <li> a bit awkward first. But getting better now.&lt;br /&gt;Actually my shaver body color was black. However I could not find black one....&lt;br /&gt;But, generaly works ok.</li>
    <li> Replacement parts met my expectations</li>
    <li> The foil is amazing. It seems to last forever. The cutter, not so much. The old worn one cut better.</li>
    <li> hole are made for small folicule like the japonnesse baird</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make a difference with the old foil.  Seems like a waste of cash.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and in excellent condition.  Price is so good I ordered two.  As good as, or better than, the original head and blade combination.  Recommend this product and merchant.</li>
    <li> Thoroughly pleased with the whole experience.</li>
    <li> Foil doesn&#x27;t seem to fit as closely as original.  Shave doesn&#x27;t feel as close as original foil &amp; cutter.  Will monitor for a while.</li>
    <li> Ordered these after the foil tore on my original (and gave me a permanant scar!)  Was really just looking for something to get me by between blade shaves, but have been pretty impressed with this replacement set. New foil seems to lift my beard better, so I get a better shave than with the original.  Will never be as close as a blade shave, but for those between days when I need fast and simple, this replacement set works very well. For the price, a good bargain.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit as advertised for my Braun Cruzer but provides a very disappointing shave.  The holes in the foil are different than the original and for some reason does not result in a very close shave. Should have spent the extra money and bought the original replacement part from Braun.</li>
    <li> In my haste, I didn&#x27;t realize this was an aftermarket product when I ordered it.  Once I had it I thought it&#x27;s easy to try it than return it but this was a mistake.  The replacement didn&#x27;t work well at all.  I had to buy one from Braun that worked great.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The product meets my expectation and the packaging was good too.</li>
    <li> Inferior product.  Very poor quality,  total waste of money. Used one time and then had to buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;Beware.</li>
    <li> The use of deleted spare parts that make functional the old electric fixture is good to the environment, we must avoid to drop to the garbage items in good working condition</li>
    <li> Everything as expected.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this junk.  1. It is not a Braun manufactured product.  2. My old, dull blades cut better than this out of the package knock-off, I think it actually gave me razor burn.  Shame on this site for selling such garbage.</li>
    <li> Thanks for providing replacement parts for a Braun razor that I&#x27;ve had for many years and really enjoy using.  I&#x27;d had a hard time finding the replacement foil and cutter for it and then found it on here for a great price!</li>
    <li> Smoother feel with this foil. Seems to work okay. Color doesn&#x27;t match, but it was like 40% less than the original.</li>
    <li> the blade clamp spacers are too wide and do NOT FIT the moving clamp of the Cruzer3 2825-&lt;br /&gt;but the foil seems ok not as good as original though- hairs get caught it seems.. and pull --&lt;br /&gt;i did not bother return  it and i bought the same sold by Braun for $25- if this one fits will let u know -</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement because foil of my Braun Cruzer broke. It was impossible to shave without cutting my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I mainly needed a new foil. After reading reviews, I realized that foil should work (most reviews indicate accurately that cutters don&#x27;t work for Braun Cruzer). That&#x27;s exactly what happened. Now I have a new foil, but I realize that a new cutter would have been effective, and I&#x27;m happy that apart from this replacement, I also bought a new shaver. I will use this one for travel.</li>
    <li> Very well pleased with it better then I expected,thanks again for the quick service I can repeat what I said and hope that is enough</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product!!!  The screen fits, but THE CUTTER/BLADES does not fit my shaver.  If you do buy this product for any of the shavers it claims to fit, be sure to try it out right away, before the &amp;#34;return window&amp;#34; closes.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion as expected. Fit my razor as expected. Doesn&#x27;t cut quite like the Braun replacements but they were a 1/4 of the price. They will do nicely. Thanks for the good service!</li>
    <li> the razor foil &amp; blade did NOT fit or work in my Braun razor as advertised. The shipping was ahead of predictions, it arrived in GREAT shape- it still didn&#x27;t fit. Everyone was courteous, but having to PAY for a return is absurd, next time I&#x27;ll shop elsewhere, perhaps e-bay ??</li>
    <li> Cupo perfectamente en mi rasuradora.</li>
    <li> this is not the original style that came with the razor. the holes are too close and the hair cant go thru as easily. does not give a close shave!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product and great service!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my razor as advertised</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my Braun foil cutter again so i ordered this.  It works well, but my Braun rechargeable battery isn&#x27;t holding a charge like it once did.  I suppose the next time I need a new foil cutter I may just buy a brand new electric shaver.</li>
    <li> The piece worked great it fit just like the original would definantly recommend it brought life back to my razor</li>
    <li> Product thicker than original. Does not shave as closely. seems durable and is lasting. Screen needs to be thinner. Probably would not purchase again</li>
    <li> My replacement coil and cutter fit perfect. i was worried after reading the other reviews but glad  I took the chance. Good value.</li>
    <li> Shaves better than old original, but not as good as new. The original foil on my Cruzer 4 cracked and was getting old but I was appalled at the cost of getting a Braun replacement which was at that time almost half the price of getting a brand new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Goodman replacement at that time was $10 including shipping (from Goodman directly), so I figured why not give it a go. I did not want to shell out for a new razor yet, and I felt it was unreasonable to pay almost 50% of the cost of a new razor to get just a Braun replacement foil/blade set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement didn&#x27;t color match but still looks quite ok. Both foil and blade snapped into place perfectly. The foil hole pattern is exactly the same as my original Braun but you can tell by pressing the foil that the Goodman foil is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few shaves were not great but after a few days it seemed to have &amp;#34;seated&amp;#34; itself and the shaves got better.  I would say that shaves aren&#x27;t quite as close as the original, but it IS better than using an old Braun foil. The thicker foil also makes it feel like it is unlikely to crack like my original Braun foil.</li>
    <li> No it did not meet the requirement or my expectations needs. It does not cut as good as a brand name would. I would never get this again.</li>
    <li> If you own an electric shaver, It pays to the screen and head every 12-18 months depending on the coarseness of your beard. I have been using Braun shavers since 1992. Have always gotten a great close shave. But the key is a sharp cutter and a new screen certainly helps. Think of it like changing the fluids in your car and rotating your tires ... well, something like that . Wishing you many close shaves {*_*} ... and no, I don&#x27;t work for or repair shavers :)</li>
    <li> Meh. Not original, but it kinda works.&lt;br /&gt;Was cheap</li>
    <li> Thought this was direct replacement for 1775. Foil part fits fine, metal part is stronger than old style, which has been a problem, blade piece didn&#x27;t fit my razor. This foil part is thicker and stronger, but it takes longer to shave. Old style surface cracks and breaks and can cut your face, this one is sturdy. I would rather take an extra couple minutes to shave, than cut my face up, so I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Unusable! This is junk. I have a Braun 1775 shaver. This foil &amp;#34;fits&amp;#34; but gives a very poor shave. It is NOT made for this shaver. Why? Because the foil sits up above the cutter block and you have to push down on the foil ( with your face ) to get the cutter blades to contact your skin. This is NOT, NOT a replacement for the Braun 1775 and the sellers know this. They don&#x27;t care, they have your money....&lt;br /&gt;But really the fault lies with the Braun, for providing outrageously high priced replacement parts. Not only are they overpriced but they, Braun, have changed the design of the foil. The original foil had &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; holes in it. The new foils have a crap design that just doesn&#x27;t work. Do they know this, of course they do. What they want is for you to buy a new razor. so much for the environment! And the new razors are crap also, so then you will buy another. Sad, it really is...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut the way it used to. The foil is tighter &amp; won&#x27;t let the whiskers in to cut them. That is the best way for me to explain it. The company I purchased from did a great job. This has nothing to do with them. It is in the manufacturing of the new foil.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;razor and screen fits the braun cruzer 5&lt;br /&gt;screen is more durable than the original&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;lower price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;shave is not as good as the original&lt;br /&gt;color does not match&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case the original razor I had was bent and the screen had a hole in it, thanks to baggage check people man handling my luggage. any way this one popped right on and worked the color is off which is not too much of a problem as I normally don&#x27;t put my shaver on display in the living room. The shave seems to not be as close, guessing it is the screen being thicker.  All in all a pretty decent purchase, will buy again when the two I bought wear out.</li>
    <li> got it ok...thank you</li>
    <li> The cutter does not snap into a 1775 model razor as advertised. The plastic piece is not designed to fit this razor. If you have a Braun 1775, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Completely as advertised. Fits and works in my razor.</li>
    <li> I feel this work is well recommended</li>
    <li> Does not shave close like factory replacement. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly. However, the cutter head will not stay on the \\&quot;mounting plate\\&quot;. There are two cross strips on the undersaide frame of cutter which need to have small \\&quot;extensions\\&quot; that clip onto the \\&quot;mounting plate\\&quot; in order to hold it in place. The picture is not detailed enough to show if these are there. The part number is correct,and the model I have is listed as one that it will fit, and the screen fits fine. However I cannot use the cutter head.</li>
    <li> the new screen and cutter return the braun to &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; status.  I replace them every 1-2 years, and I think the shaver is 18-20 years old</li>
    <li> This was a good price for this unit.  The color was not an exact match for the unit that I have, but it&#x27;s the same style so it worked without any problem.</li>
