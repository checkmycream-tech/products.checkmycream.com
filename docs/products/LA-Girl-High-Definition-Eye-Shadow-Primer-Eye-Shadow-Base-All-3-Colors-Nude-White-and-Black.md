      <li>and it looks exactly the same as it did when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>I use them frequently!</li>
      <li>so I went to nyx and got the better ones andgot a new black and white</li>
      <li>but it was so messy and it rubbed off easily.</li>
      <li>but so far it works</li>
      <li>For a primer, I use Wet n Wild Fergie eyeshadow primer- slightly sticky, mostly sheer, love it!</li>
      <li>though I have only used the white so far</li>

    <li> First off, let me say I use this as a base, not as a primer! I need a base because I&#x27;m African American (MAC NW45) and I need a lighter base for my eyeshadow colors to show up more on my skin. For a primer, I use Wet n Wild Fergie eyeshadow primer- slightly sticky, mostly sheer, love it! So this LA Girl is just to help me with color payoff. I really like it. I used to use NYX jumbo pencil in milk but it was so messy and it rubbed off easily. The LA girl is creamier than NYX milk, but not so creamy that it slides all over the place. I find this easier to work with. I have oily, hooded lids and with the LA GIrl (and Fergie eye primer) my shadows last all day. I put on my makeup today at 7am, now it&#x27;s 7pm and it looks exactly the same as it did when I first put it on. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the nude color was truly nude or more beige. When I put on the nude base, it doesn&#x27;t really look any different than when I use the white base. It&#x27;s kind of ashy, but I still use it since you can&#x27;t see that after I apply eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> The best primer I&#x27;ve ever used and will never stray from:)</li>
    <li> I love this product. It last long and does what it needs to do. I haven&#x27;t worn it with eyeshadow yet but I sure it will do It&#x27;s job. Can easily blend with just a finger or brush</li>
    <li> Great quality! I love them! Will order again!</li>
    <li> This work really well and sometimes I use the nude as shadow with liquid liner.</li>
    <li> Not what I had expected. Very poor quality</li>
    <li> The primer top was squashed by the cap and the nude color immediately broke when opened. I am very disappointed in the item I received.</li>
    <li> Really soft and easy to use !</li>
    <li> great formula, the white primer really makes colours more vibrant and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with this product especially for the price.  Go on very smooth and the white shows up great! Will more than likely order this again.</li>
    <li> Barely use bc not really worth it or looks good</li>
    <li> I wus happy to get this to it came with my makeup Bush set I can&#x27;t wat to use...</li>
    <li> This item works just as well as urban decay primer potion lasts all day and makes the colors pop I love the nude color I used the white once and also the black do not let the colors of the primers intimidate you.. your shadows will stick to them so well it covers the primer completely flawlessly and in my opinion blends easier than the primer potion.. I find the primer potion very drying and makes wrinkles appear more this covers any imperfections for a clean slate to work with ! LOVE LOVE LOVE !</li>
    <li> These primers work soooooo great! They last all day and I&#x27;ve had no creasing problem at all! And their price is amazingly low! They&#x27;re def worth the purchase! ♥♥♥♥</li>
    <li> Very LA Girl primers are amazing good! I use them frequently! The texture and quality of the primers are shockingly GREAT! I highly reccomend these to makeup artists as well women who love wearing eye makeup! I will be buying these again!</li>
    <li> Makes eye shadow pop and is great for creating different looks. Makes blending/smudging easier and protects skin from stains from brighter pigments. This is a must have for my daily makeup routine.</li>
    <li> They are very convenient to take on a trip and work very well. I can see a huge difference in my color pigmentation and lasting power. The white one I&#x27;ve used constantly has started acting up because it&#x27;ll sometimes not wants to go back down but it&#x27;s very good for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I love this didn&#x27;t know they had black in primers it works gr8 though I have only used the white so far but so far it works</li>
    <li> I have been searching high and low for the perfect primer and this is it!!! Even better than MAC paint pot!!! I have a very small lid (like an asian) and this primer makes all of my eye shadow colors pop! Never have to reapply, doesnt crease at all! great coverage. U can even use the beige for eye brow clean up!!! Definitely will reorder this again!</li>
    <li> I wanted the black base the most ... and after one use it broke and fell right out of the tube and I had too throw it away ... not happy that I paid over 10 bucks for so I went to nyx and got the better ones andgot a new black and white</li>
    <li> I purchased these primers for myself and a friend. Having oily skin and lids, these primers are not good. I work 12 hours a day/night and before the halfway point of my shift my eyeshadow has already creased and smudged. I don&#x27;t recommend unless you aren&#x27;t going to be out to long and just need a base for your eyeshadow.</li>
