<li> Curly hair tends to be dry and a little coarse.</li>
<li> so I notice her skin turns a little red if I get the product on it, but she doesn&#x27;t ever complain of pain.  </li>
<li> not much to say.</li>
<li> I really like Pantene and their ethnic line, but it is very difficult to get where I live.  </li>

<li> I have found that if I use it on the roots of my hair it makes it look a little oily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m nothing less than totally pissed. I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2007 &amp; I loved it soooo much. This new packaging came along with a changed formula that does the same thing most of these so called mositurizers do for black hair :NOTHING but sit on the hair. It no longer absorbs into my hair. Used practically the whole tube in 2 days where the old tube would last me at least 3 weeks. And still, nothing. My hair is just STIFF. I had bought 4 tubes and subscribed to receive 4 tubes every 4 months. I&#x27;m canceling my subscription right now.</li>
    <li> This is what I have been looking for. I am mixed asian and black and have long, wavy hair. It appears dry most of the time, but this makes it soft, shiny, and the waves look very nice. Smell is nice, too. It is not oily at all. I use this product as my go-to now. I had no problem buying a pack of 4 because I will probably not find something that works this well for this price. Believe me, I have looked for the past 8 years.</li>
    <li> Curly hair tends to be dry and a little coarse. This product, along with the women of color conditioner from pantene, softens and relaxes my hair. It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, including more expensive ones. I have found that if I use it on the roots of my hair it makes it look a little oily. Now I just use it on the ends of my hair now where my hair can soak up every bit of moisture I give it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned with long light blonde hair and winter is horrid on my hair. I discovered this product and thought: why not?  It&#x27;s incredible! After a week of using this my very dry/straw-like hair is soft and silky!  I use it liberally EVERY morning on my towel-dried hair. It&#x27;s shiny and soft and has no static fly-aways.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now, and it works great. Keeps my hair moisturized for about 5 days. I love it. Also this is a great deal 4 bottles for only $8.80 when at the store they are $3.99 a bottle which rounds up to $16 plus tax. You can&#x27;t beat this deal at all.</li>
    <li> This products leaves Africanamerican hair lovely without build up and very managable.  Love it.  Bring it all the way to Costa Rica to use for me and my daughter.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist actually recommended this moisturizer for my thinning hair, and I have used nothing else since.  I am an african american woman with natural hair, no chemicals, but this product works fabulously for moisturizing and keeping my hair sleek and shiny.  Not an overly greasy product and the moisture is retained in the hair.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> not much to say. used the product to moisturize. The product did not moisturize, left it dry, and caused breakouts on my skin. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Daily Oil Cream Moisturizer is an outstanding product.  The cream is light resulting in a natural feel and beautiful texture.  Thank you Pantene for considering the needs of women of color.  Obviously, your research is sound; continue to be sensitive and supportive of diversity.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer for hair that is dry and brittle. Once I started using the Pantene Pro-V Relaxed &amp; Natural for Women of Color Daily Oil Cream Moisturizer, if my hair could speak it would say \\&quot;Thank You...What took you so long?\\&quot; My hair is much healthier now. A definite must for women of color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this item in the stores, so I am glad that there is an online outlet for purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> The product helps me to manage my natural hair. It conditions and smooth out tangle hair and allows me to comb easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was no longer found in stores and thanks to AMAZON I am happy again!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It is not too greasy but has just enough oil. It works best on dry hair not wet. Once it has soaked in (preferably over night) you can hot curl and the moisture last for days. I buy it by the case!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my aunt who love the product and the quality. I will certainly purchase this product again,&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
    <li> Applied to wet hair; blew dry terrifically my naturally, kinky hair.  Between shampoos, I use it every other day working into the ends first; then, working thru rest of hair.  Brush; makes it shiny.  Would purchase again when needed.  The product states for women of color; however, my hair is so very naturally curly.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> Why is this SEVENTY BUCKS?? i thought i was seeing things and looked  to see if it was a pack of ten or so..Not even the case. this price is outrageous and hopefully its  a typo!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that can be used everyday or even twice per day. Helps hair to feel soft without being overly greasy.</li>
    <li> I wear my gray hair short, so this daily oil cream is all I use to look healthy and fabulous.</li>
    <li> Product as described but price was a little high.</li>
    <li> So,I&#x27;ve got COURSE hair &amp; this stuff works great when my hair is relaxed. Gives just the right amount of moisture, without weighing down my hair &amp; making it feel too greasy. And it smells nice too! But I&#x27;ve got to go easy on the chemicals. So, when my hair is it&#x27;s natural state &amp; my &#x27;kitchen&#x27; has returned, that&#x27;s when I gotta break out the hair grease. Cause the daily moisturizer just won&#x27;t cut it. But it works great on my niece&#x27;s(mixed) natural locks.</li>
    <li> All products purchased were excellent. Was delivered promptly, and I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Really good! One of my favorite hair lotions. Unfortunately very hard to find where I live and ordering online isn&#x27;t always feasible. Light weight leaves my hair very silky.</li>
    <li> I like all the pantene pro-V products. I&#x27;m a woman of color and it work perfect with my hairs so I recommend this...</li>
    <li> I have adopted two little ones (one girl who is 3 and one boy who is 2) who are at least one quarter african-american and the rest caucasion.  Their hair is very curly and dry.  I use this product after washing their hair or after soaking their hair in between washes.  It makes it much easier to comb through and also leaves it soft and and smooth without being greasy at all.  My daughter has sensitive skin so I notice her skin turns a little red if I get the product on it, but she doesn&#x27;t ever complain of pain.  Their hair is fairly short and so an 8.7 ounce bottle goes a long way for us.</li>
    <li> This project was recommended on the Wendy Williams show. I have thin hair and this product delivers exactly what was promised....stronger hair that has significantly been able to grow due to adequate, but a naturally appearing well-moisturized look. I have recommended it to many friends.</li>
    <li> I am quite impressed with this product. I have 4b afro hair that is texturized. Though I do have a chemical straightener in my hair , my hair is very much kinky (just a little looser than when natural). When I blow out my hair, I use this product to keep my tresses soft and moisturized without worrying back it reverting back to its kinky, tightly coiled state.  I usually moisturize my hair with water-based products when wearing my hair kinky, but this is great for blowouts and straight styles without fear of reverting. Love the smell too. I will continue using this products.</li>
    <li> This hair product is a must for me. I use it after I have washed my hair and towel dry it. When I straighten my hair, it looks beautiful. It feels soft and smells great. This is a must have hair product for every black woman.</li>
    <li> REPURCHASE: YES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair and this stuff works. Its a cream and not heavy at all. You can put as much or as little as your hair needs and the hair will not be sticky or gunky. Its also has a nice suttle smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product,  I use if daily and I can really see a difference in the condition of my hair.  I would reccommend this product.  It is especially great for women with dry hair problems.</li>
    <li> I really like Pantene and their ethnic line, but it is very difficult to get where I live.  It is really a great product and it keeps my natural hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything on the market, the most expensive to the least and nothing really work for my thick and dry hair. I  gave myself a extra virgin olive oil hot oil treatment, and after it dried, my hair was shedding, I immediately applied the patene oil and like magic it disappeard. I use a pea- size amount everyday, before I comb my hair. It is not oily, so it won&#x27;t weigh my  perm-hair down, when I get new growth, I apply more of the product...It works for me.</li>
    <li> I was so happy that you had this product for sell.  A lot of stores stopped carrying it, and it is hard to find African-American styling products.  This product is perfect for my hair which is curly.  This is the only cream that I have used that really moisturizes my hair, and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely AMAZING!  If there was some kind of freaky law that allowed everybody to have only one hair product, I&#x27;d choose Pantene Pro-V Relaxed and Natural for Women of Color. ENOUGH SAID.</li>
    <li> This it the best hair cream i ever have. I use it before I blow dry my hair, it is easy to apply and keep hair healthy, shiny for long time.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best thing that I have found in years, I wear my hair in a natural style and I use this cream daily on my hair, it keeps my hair soft and make it very easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I received the product before the scheduled arrival which was stupendous; in addition, the product was a bargain compared to the cost for 4 in the store.</li>
    <li> I have natural extremely curly hair which is naturally drying and this oil creme is the only thing I have found that makes my hair  soft.  This product gives my hair the much needed moisture!</li>
    <li> This product has been very satisfactory, for the past three years I&#x27;ve been purchasing it from Amazon.com for my wife who is very much satisfied with the product,and very happy with the compliments she gets.</li>
