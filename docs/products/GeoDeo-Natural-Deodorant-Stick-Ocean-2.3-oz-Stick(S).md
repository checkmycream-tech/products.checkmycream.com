      <li>Geodeo is the best I have found.  </li>
      <li>it worked great for me.</li>
      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>has me convinced to switch - if I could afford it :^)</li>
      <li>My husband loved this deodorant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111</li>
      <li>They keep the bacteria that cause the B.O. smell from growing, and work surprisingly well for just being a chunk of salt.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t smell good from the moment I applied it</li>
      <li>Love the scent!</li>
      <li>and then after just 2 hours or so, I could detect my own odor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Best natural deodorant around.  </li>
      <li>The best natural deodorant my husband has found.</li>
      <li>I did get the ocean, and it does smell like a man, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>the smell is just ok.</li>
      <li>Why is it that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant products leave you smelling au naturel?</li>
      <li>Lovely.  </li>
      <li>I had better results when I reapplied throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>But I wanted an aluminum free deodorant and this one suffices.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the most effective deo but for me it does exactly what I want it to do; it works fine during a day in the office, and it keeps my shirts from getting yellow stains.</li>
      <li>will say, as soon as I contacted Amazon, I received a full refund and was not even required to return the product.</li>
      <li>But we are not crazy about this smell for us girls.  </li>
      <li>Most of the natural deodorant brands make you stink around noon.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, but it simply didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>After the first week I found myself needing to reapply throughout the day.</li>
      <li>In the past many good shirts were ruined by using regular deodorant; ever since I started using Geodeo</li>
      <li>to this, I was using Primal Pit Paste, but neither really seem to help.</li>
      <li>The scent is very &amp;#34;</li>
      <li>5 dollars from my healthfood store and didn&#x27;t sweat much at all at my job and smelled funky 1/2-way</li>
      <li>My husband really likes it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching the internet to try to find a deodorant that is aluminum free that actually WORKS!!!</li>
      <li>manly&amp;#34; which I was not expecting but noticed it kept me cool and dry for the first week of use.</li>
      <li>I prefer natural products when I can get them, but generally from both personal experience and the experiences of friends and family, most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants just don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>This is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, there isn&#x27;t anything &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; about it, but it&#x27;s certainly not going to keep you smelling fresh all day!</li>
      <li>By the end of the day I smell too natural.</li>
      <li>The ocean scent was too masculine for me.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it seemed to do nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Prior</li>
      <li>barely works.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re set on a natural product that actually works, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
      <li>Please note, natural deodorants work differently from person to person based on their makeup.  </li>
      <li>The only natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve used that has ever worked for me are those salt crystal ones sold under various names and brands.</li>
      <li>Product doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as Secret and other mainstream drugstore brands, but maybe that&#x27;s just how the more natural products are.</li>
      <li>I tested it the usual way-put it on right after showering before bed, woke up in the morning, and checked for B.O.</li>

    <li> Smells nice, but it simply didn&#x27;t work for me.  At all.</li>
    <li> I realize that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but having tried lots of natural and aluminum-free deodorants, this one was definitely the worst for me. It didn&#x27;t smell good from the moment I applied it and then after just 2 hours or so, I could detect my own odor.&lt;br /&gt;I will say, as soon as I contacted Amazon, I received a full refund and was not even required to return the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not a huge fan of having to wind it up and down every time I want to use it (otherwise the lid doesn&#x27;t close if you leave the stick of deodorant up) and the smell is just ok. But I wanted an aluminum free deodorant and this one suffices.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding any deodorant that works for me, much less a natural. I was amazed! Geodeo works, it even passed the 98 degree test, which is where I stay outside for hours in 98 degree weather. I did get the ocean, and it does smell like a man, but that&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;d rather smell like a man than a ferret.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant around.  Most of the natural deodorant brands make you stink around noon. Geodeo is the best I have found.  Please note, natural deodorants work differently from person to person based on their makeup.  I have had friends that have used Geodeo and not liked it as much as me.  Its trail and error, but it worked great for me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t quite work for me. The smell is like a men&#x27;s deodorant so maybe it was for men. I thought I would give it a try and it didn&#x27;t quite do the job for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching the internet to try to find a deodorant that is aluminum free that actually WORKS!!! This one received high marks on a few blogs that I follow. I was surprised that it seemed to do nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this, I was using Primal Pit Paste, but neither really seem to help. I had better results when I reapplied throughout the day. This is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, there isn&#x27;t anything &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; about it, but it&#x27;s certainly not going to keep you smelling fresh all day!</li>
    <li> My husband loved this deodorant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for me. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> barely works.  By the end of the day I smell too natural.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the most effective deo but for me it does exactly what I want it to do; it works fine during a day in the office, and it keeps my shirts from getting yellow stains. In the past many good shirts were ruined by using regular deodorant; ever since I started using Geodeo this is no longer the case. That to me is an overriding factor.</li>
    <li> The ocean scent was too masculine for me. Never tried it; gave it away to a guy friend.</li>
    <li> Terrible. 5 dollars from my healthfood store and didn&#x27;t sweat much at all at my job and smelled funky 1/2-way they my 12-hr shift. Lovely.  👎👎 Ocean smells like bug spray too. Terrible product! Yuck! Yuck!!!</li>
    <li> Why is it that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant products leave you smelling au naturel? I prefer natural products when I can get them, but generally from both personal experience and the experiences of friends and family, most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants just don&#x27;t work. Still, I bought this product on a whim, because I wanted to see if the &amp;#34;odor neutralizing enzymes&amp;#34; in it truly worked. I tested it the usual way-put it on right after showering before bed, woke up in the morning, and checked for B.O. It didn&#x27;t work at all! In fact, the slight smell of the deodorant, which smells quite nice in the stick, mixes with the smell of the B.O. to combine into an even worse smell! I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant before too, same problem, not only did it not prevent the B.O., it added to it! The only natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve used that has ever worked for me are those salt crystal ones sold under various names and brands. They keep the bacteria that cause the B.O. smell from growing, and work surprisingly well for just being a chunk of salt. I can&#x27;t imagine how Geodeo is supposed to be a deodorant for running around during the day when it can&#x27;t even inhibit bacteria growth at night, when you&#x27;re not even sweating. If you&#x27;re set on a natural product that actually works, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> The best natural deodorant my husband has found. Love the scent!</li>
    <li> This is our fav brand of deodorant to use.  But we are not crazy about this smell for us girls.  It is for a man not a women.  Manly scent should be on the label.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as Secret and other mainstream drugstore brands, but maybe that&#x27;s just how the more natural products are.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes it. It smells great</li>
    <li> The scent is very &amp;#34; manly&amp;#34; which I was not expecting but noticed it kept me cool and dry for the first week of use. After the first week I found myself needing to reapply throughout the day. It may work for some people but it no longer works for me . I have a highly physical job and need something to cover at least 8 hours .</li>
    <li> Would use it exclusively if it weren&#x27;t quite so pricey.  No doubt it performs as well as advertised and has me convinced to switch - if I could afford it :^)</li>
