      <li>And good thing much cheaper than in store.</li>
      <li>This is a rich moisture eye cream that goes on easily and absorbs well.</li>
      <li>but the product appears to be genuine</li>
      <li>fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different cosmetic lines over the years but am now very satisfied with the La Prairie line and don&#x27;t plan on changing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and fills my skin full of moisture.</li>
      <li>pricey but worth it!  </li>
      <li>None other can compare, and people always remark what beautiful skin I have.</li>
      <li>HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS THE REAL PRODUCT WHEN YOU CAN GET SO MANY INTIMATIONS WHEN BUYING ON LINE????????????  </li>
      <li>No one believes my true age.</li>
      <li>but I,m worth it</li>
      <li>Its okay... Not worth the money, I wish I would have read more reviews.</li>
      <li>I had to return this product once to a company that shall remain nameless because the imperfect packaging had caused the cream to discolor, but ordering thru Amazon was the perfect transaction in every way.</li>
      <li>my skin feels smooth &amp; soft.  </li>
      <li>I actually REALLY dislike the smell of the cream and find that it&#x27;s way overpowering.!</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>HOW DO WE KNOW THIS PRODUCT IS REAL??????????</li>
      <li>item was delivered very promptly by seller.  </li>
      <li>WASN&#x27;T REAL.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite facial cream.</li>
      <li>However, I think no over-the-counter facial cream is worth this much money</li>
      <li>A tiny bit covers the whole face and leaves even my ultra sensitive skin soft, smooth and nourished.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of other creams and this makes my 65 year old face feel better.</li>
      <li>BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE NEW NOT TO BID, WONDER WHY.  </li>
      <li>, I would definitely try a sample in a store first.  </li>
      <li>fairly young and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet</li>
      <li>i am 70 years old.</li>
      <li>Product arrived on time and in original packaging;  I was a little concerned when I learned that the Spa was in Hong Kong</li>
      <li>It is well worth the money to me since a jar lasts at least a year if you receive the whole package in pristeen condition.  </li>
      <li>The product is excellent and of all the other places we looked it was by far the less expensive.</li>

<li> Just like I would buy in Neiman Marcus for half the price...</li>
<li> And check to see that the jar lid is tight and the foil seal has not been compromised.</li>
<li> not worth the crazy amount of money spent on it.</li>
<li> Do not accept this product if there is any evidence that the outer cellophane wrap on the box is not perfectly sealed.</li>
<li> and yes it&#x27;s expensive  </li>
<li> Call it my guilty pleasure, except that I don&#x27;t feel guilty about it all.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the quality is very good</li>
    <li> Love this product! This is my third jar in 2 years. It keeps my face glowing. No one believes my true age. It&#x27;s expensive for my budget but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite facial cream. It makes my skin look great. I bought it once and really loved it. However, I think no over-the-counter facial cream is worth this much money and I decided not to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Outstanding in every way.  Smells great, too!</li>
    <li> fantastic product.  -  good reseller experience</li>
    <li> A little definitely goes a looong way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly young and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, therefore I cannot attest to any anti-aging statements.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to purchase a good cream to be proactive with good skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this product does not irritate my skin, is a little bit on the &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; side (but definitely not greasy), and provides a noticeable &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to my skin.  My skin feels slightly energized the following day when I apply it at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I would definitely try a sample in a store first.  I actually REALLY dislike the smell of the cream and find that it&#x27;s way overpowering.!</li>
    <li> The La Prairie Luxe Cream is the very best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have tried other creams in the past, but always go back to the Luxe Cream. None other can compare, and people always remark what beautiful skin I have. P.S. i am 70 years old.</li>
    <li> this stuff burns my face, leaving it red and irritated. not worth the crazy amount of money spent on it.</li>
    <li> The wife liked it it seemed genuine, when compared to the one we bought from abroad.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years now. It is well worth the money to me since a jar lasts at least a year if you receive the whole package in pristeen condition.  Apply the cream sparingly. A tiny bit covers the whole face and leaves even my ultra sensitive skin soft, smooth and nourished. Call it my guilty pleasure, except that I don&#x27;t feel guilty about it all.  Do not accept this product if there is any evidence that the outer cellophane wrap on the box is not perfectly sealed. And check to see that the jar lid is tight and the foil seal has not been compromised. I had to return this product once to a company that shall remain nameless because the imperfect packaging had caused the cream to discolor, but ordering thru Amazon was the perfect transaction in every way.</li>
    <li> Very good price and excellent product!</li>
    <li> This product seems to help. I&#x27;ve tried lots of other creams and this makes my 65 year old face feel better.</li>
    <li> This is a rich moisture eye cream that goes on easily and absorbs well. I am 63 and really like the results I&#x27;ve experienced from this product.

    <li> pricey but worth it!  my skin feels smooth &amp; soft.  item was delivered very promptly by seller.  very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Best cream ,I can see change in 1week on my face and i hope i will satisfated more. And good thing much cheaper than in store.</li>
    <li> Have always loved the product -- the boon here is that it was sealed and properly packaged and delivered on time for a discount of the department store price.  That is a win in my book.</li>
    <li> Saw the difference after one use!! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for my wife for over 10 years. It works beautifully. will continue to order it</li>
    <li> Love it. Great moistuizer!</li>
    <li> I have used La Prairie skin care for 26 years but recently switched from the skin caviar to face to this product. It is incredibly moisturizing and the service from sweet caress.com was excellent.  My order arrived perfectly in ten days.</li>
    <li> this is the most moisturizing cream i have ever used. i love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 25 years and yes it&#x27;s expensive  but I,m worth it and my skin looks younger and youthful and Pamala Anderson uses it but I was using it long before her. it tightens the skin. sincerely Kay Trammell</li>
    <li> great product fabulous price point</li>
    <li> This cream has done wonders for my skin. It&#x27;s light and fills my skin full of moisture.</li>
    <li> STAY AWAY THIS SALER!! THEY ARE CHEATR!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding, top-of-the-line product.</li>
    <li> my wife loved, good result</li>
    <li> I love the discounted price. I have been using this cream for years. I love this all of the La Priairie products.</li>

    <li> Best face cream on the market for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Very good firming and moisturizing cream.  Price is excellent compared to department stores.  La Prairie products are top of the line.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS THE REAL PRODUCT WHEN YOU CAN GET SO MANY INTIMATIONS WHEN BUYING ON LINE????????????  I ORDERED A TORY BURCH FLAP WALLET AND RETURNED BECAUSE I FELT IT WASN&#x27;T REAL.  I STOPPED A CHANNEL OFFER BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE NEW NOT TO BID, WONDER WHY.  BOTH TIMES NO PROBLEM WITH THE SELLER, JUST CREDITED MY ACCOUNT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO HOW DO WE KNOW THIS PRODUCT IS REAL??????????</li>
    <li> Its okay... Not worth the money, I wish I would have read more reviews. Amazon is great, however, LaPrairie can be but isn&#x27;t across the board.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good cream and I really like it.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent and of all the other places we looked it was by far the less expensive. We recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just like I would buy in Neiman Marcus for half the price...What a great find and hope they always have it</li>
