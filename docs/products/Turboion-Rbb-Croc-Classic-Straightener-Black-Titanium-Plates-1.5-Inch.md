<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought... Love it!!</li>
    <li> Only flatiron we use...was excited when we received item only to be disappointed when it didn&#x27;t work we had to wait over a week for entire process to be completed that is when we ordered it received it returned it then waited for refund.&lt;br /&gt;Now we have to purchase this item elsewhere and probably pay more for it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I didnt even order this one but this one came in the mail. I ordered the Croce with the mirrored plates. Anyhow I was happy to get it because it was recommended by a hair dresser and loved the results after it was used on my daughters frizzy hair.I was really excited to try it out and was dismayed at the settings. It says it goes up to 420 degrees but I have a Solara flat iron that reaches the same degree on it and its way hotter. It took me longer using the Croc  flat iron even while using  product in my hair. I tried it without product also ..same results. I think it would have been better to buy one of those cheaper drug store brands and probably get the same results if not better. I let my daughter use it and she said the same thing. I had thrown the box it came in out already so wasnt going to try and return it. It was an $80 sitting in my bathroom drawer lesson that I wont ever repeat with this name brand again.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this iron. The first one lasted me about a year and a half before the swivel cord broke off but it was worth every penny. My hair is just a bit wavy easy to manage. With the croc it takes about ten minutes to straighten my hair and about 15 to curl it with nice soft waves. It leaves my hair shiny with zero frizz.. I love it i hope my second purchase lasts as long.</li>
    <li> I have had the same Croc for three years and it works just as well today as the first day I got it. The only reason I am replacing it is because my toddler knocked it off the counter and one of the sides broke and it started to pull my hair when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I have very course and curly hair. People don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them because my Croc works so well. Even my new hairdresser didn&#x27;t believe me about how curly my hair was until it got wet, because my hair is so straight, sleek, and has zero damage from daily straightening.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, you need this flat iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick hair and absolutely loves this straightener. Her previous one was a CHI and she prefers this one. It takes her half the time to straighten her hair. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a back up while my t3 mane tamer was being replaced by manufacture. It&#x27;s a wonderful flat iron. Gets very hot and that is what you need if you have course frizzy hair. Shipping was fast and packaging was great. Glides through hair and doesn&#x27;t pull. This will cut down the time you spend on your hair by half. I have had t3, FHI, 3 or more CHI&#x27;s. The croc is way better than the FHI and the CHI and just about as good as my T3.</li>
    <li> At first it worked wonderfully. After one week of use it will not stay hot. It heats up to the programmed temperature and then after about 5 minutes it starts to cool down on its own.</li>
    <li> This product is great and I recommend to anyone looking for  a hot iron that will get the job done!</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to spend so much money on a hair straightener, but I have to say that I am very happy I did!  This unit heats up INCREDIBLY fast, about 30 seconds to 350 degrees.  I have crazy, thick, damaged and wavy hair that is so very hard to tame.  It used to take me 45 minutes to straighten my hair.  Now it takes me about 10 -15 minutes, and it lasts for days! I usually only have to go over a section once (maybe twice if it doesn&#x27;t fall right the first time).  The only thing I wish it had was a \\&quot;docking station\\&quot;, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it tipping over and scorching my counter top.  Luckily, that has not happened as I leave it in the sink to cool down.     Anyhow, great product, great results, good price.  Totally happy and glad I finally bought it!</li>
    <li> I bought the Croc Flat Iron back in January 2011, fulfilled through Amazon but sold through a storefront, Beauty Appliances (or something like that).  It was hands down the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever used. BUT a short month later, it completely died. Fortunately, it died one day shy of the 30 return period and I was able to get a complete refund.  I&#x27;m buying another one today in hopes of the last incident being a fluke. After reading some of the other reviews, this might be wishful thinking on my part but I loved the Croc so much I&#x27;m willing to give it one more try.</li>
    <li> Researching for a great flat iron brought up information and reviews from Amazon.com.  I have been using Sedu from Follica - their house brand for years. It is a ceramic flat iron and truly not the best.  The Croc, however, is a fantastic tool to have! It heats up real quick, has easy to use buttons and turns off automatically if not used for 30 minutes (have not had need to try this feature).  My hair has medium thickness, curly and wavy and the Croc straightens it out really well.  I am thankful to the reviewers who helped me with my purchase.  Don&#x27;t know what the big &#x27;do&#x27; about Chi.......is all about! The Croc rocks.  The prices is under $80, shipping was free and all you need to keep it clean is by using rubbing alcohol (per Croc instructions).</li>
    <li> this flatiron is wonderful i love it amazon is great.it made my hair silky and soft with only one pass and the effect last me for two weeks. very impressed. i am  black with curl thick hair.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! Bought one cuz my stylist uses it on my hair and wondered if I could get the same results.  I really love it! It makes my hair soft smooth and shiny...my daughter&#x27;s hair which is thicker than mine loves it as well...thinking about purchasing another one for her.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me onto this iron three years ago. When I found it online at Amazon, I was thrilled.  now my sister has one too.  It is by FAR the best flat Iron I have ever owned! everyone compliments me on my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t even frizz in the rain anymore!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic iron -- as good or better than Chi. I need intense heat to straighten my hair -- but the iron has to be top quality so as not to fry my hair off. This one fits the bill. It is replacing the Chi I used at work...and I will buy another to replace the FHI iron I used at home.</li>
    <li> I tried this flat iron for the first time last night and I absolutely LOVE it!!! I have curly micros in my hair(100% human weave) and I straightened it. As the flat irons straightened the hair, it also untangled it! I have yet to see how it does on my natural hair but I hope its just as well. The results were amazing. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough but I hope it doesn&#x27;t die on me like some of the other ppl said. I will update to let you know how it does on my natural hair and if it does die. (I hope not). But great  product. If you don&#x27;t got it, go get it!</li>
    <li> I have had my Croc for about a year and a half now. I absolutely LOVE it! I have fine naturally curly hair and this flat iron produces shiny, straight hair with one pass through. I like the digital temperature display and automatic shutoff feature as well. Truly a great product worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I got is as a gift for my sister, and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the Mrs and she loves it.  She says it&#x27;s the best straightener she has ever used.  Her word is good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s held up well so far and she uses it a lot over the past 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these hair straighteners for my daughter.  The first one lasted less than a year before the spring broke but I bought another one anyway.  The spring in the second one also broke after less than a year.  The manufacturer was rude and refused to send me a new spring with instructions how to install it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe their attitude and rudeness.  It was the worst customer service I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  I am done with this product and will buy my next hair straightener from a different company.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Fast delivery and great flat iron! Great for those who have unruly coarse hair!</li>
    <li> I love Croc flat irons!!  This is my second Croc.  I originally had the 1 inch Croc Infrared Flat Iron, which I love, but I&#x27;m growing my hair out so I wanted a larger iron so I could iron my hair faster.  I was going to buy the larger Infrared Iron, but I took a chance with this one and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other brands of flat irons, but I keep going back to Croc.  I really think theirs are the best.  My hair has been damamged by other irons that claim to be less damaging, but my hair always gets ruined.  Not with Croc though.  And I keep the heat very high (usually around 390), and my hair still turns out so shiny and stays much healthier.  I can flat iron my hair also with 1-2 passes, whereas other iron I needed several passes to get my hair totally straight.  I think that is another reason why my hair has so much less damage w/ the Croc - less passes equals less heat exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, when people are saying their Croc \\&quot;broke\\&quot; and the temperature is \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; at 280....it&#x27;s not actually stuck.  This happened with me and I thought mine was broke, too.  But what happened was the iron got set to C degrees as opposed to F degrees.  You just have to re-set the temperature to go back to F.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these... one for myself and one for my aunt, they both only lasted 10 months!! When it works, it works great, but it sounds like a lot of these give up on you before their 1 year bday! ha ha... now I&#x27;m going to look for a different brand...[[ASIN:B002I4Z6TG Croc Classic Nano-Titanium Flat Iron (Black Titanium Plate) 450 degrees]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll try to be short and sweet, well short and blunt. I was excited about this product. I straighten my hair every day and my salon stylist uses this brand. When it arrived, it worked great. I was impressed with my purchase and thought it was worth every penny I spent. Fast forward 3months later, the damn thing all of a sudden doesn&#x27;t heat up to 450* anymore, it now only goes up to 230*. I find it unfortunate that a product that I spent a good amount of money on didn&#x27;t even last me a whole year nor even 6months. I will be contacting the company and the product seller in regards to this. Read the reviews and think twice about buying this one. My other hair straighteners have lasted for years and this one didn&#x27;t even last for 4months. Buyer beware. If they were to work out this niche, It would be a good product.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Product more than incredible!  Straigthens hair quickly using only 310 degrees.  Easy to use.  Does not \\&quot;drag through hair.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this iron and suggested it to me.  I am very pleased with it.  Heats up quickly, and does the job.  This iron works effortlessly.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a good iron, I purchased it for the sole purpose of using it for keratin treatments. I love the swivel cord. My only complaint is that when you are working away, it&#x27;s not hard to bump the power button and turn it off. The up side is that it makes noise when you do, so you just hit the button again. It also remembers you last heat setting, so that&#x27;s not a problem.  I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t put power buttons where you grip. I also like that it tells the current temp. That is helpful when you need to cut the heat back during a treatment, ie around the hairline.</li>
    <li> I bought this in January 2012. In the beginning it worked fine but now it&#x27;s March (approximately 2.5 months later) and I noticed that the flat iron only works for 10-20 seconds until it automatically shuts off while I&#x27;m straightening my hair. I tried resetting but it still continues to shut off.    Steps I took to reset as provided by [...]  1. unplug iron, wait 10 seconds and plug in again.  2. Hold down the power for button for 20 seconds.    Now the warranty from this seller has expired and I&#x27;m left with a useless flatiron. Very annoying! My recommendation is to buy from a seller that will stand by their product and take care of their buyers by providing a longer warranty replacement or return policy. Returns are only 30 days and they do not honor the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty of 1 year. I wonder if this was a refurbished flatiron because if it was they should&#x27;ve told the buyers!    You can buy directly from Croc here:  [...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I need product that are dependable and this straightener isn&#x27;t it. The Croc worked great for 4 months then it wouldn&#x27;t stay on. If I wiggled the cord and got it in just the right position it would last till the end of my clients service. Very embarrassing. Obviously I won&#x27;t be sell this one to any of my clients.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. It makes my hair perfectly straight even if it&#x27;s been a pony tail all day long. Some of my friends used it and thought it was amazing. They are also looking to purchase. I&#x27;ve suggested this to anyone I know looking for a straightener who can afford to spend a little extra.</li>
    <li> the best hair straightener i have ever had</li>
    <li> Could someone who owns the Croc Classic flat iron tell me whether or not it has auto shut off? I&#x27;ve tried contacting Amazon customer service and they can&#x27;t tell me. The product description doesn&#x27;t indicate it, and I don&#x27;t see it mentioned in any reviews, but an employee at TurboIon HQ wrote in an email to me that it does. Thanks for your help.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever and I am a hairstylist. If you have difficult, curly hair this is a wonderful iron because it allows you to get as close as possible to the root and is very efficient.</li>
    <li> Not too much needs to be said about this iron, other then it is perfect! The price on Amazon was remarkable as well. It smooths out your hair beautifully with different heat settings, but the beauty is when you set your own heat temperature, it returns to that when you use it next time. Nice and light as well.</li>
    <li> The Croc is perfection. It works like magic on my thick, course hair. I would recomend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> After about ten months of this hot iron working flawlessly it now only heats up to 280 ... it&#x27;s stuck at that temperature which isn&#x27;t much use to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this flat iron for about 2 1/2 months, but it suddenly lost power due to a short in the swivel cord.  If the cord is in the right position, it will turn back on, but turns right back off if the cord swivels (which is the purpose of a swivel cord).  Even though there is a warranty card in the box, the warranty is NOT honored if the product is purchased through \\&quot;an unauthorized website\\&quot; like Amazon (and they list others).    I thought highly of the product at first, but I am not impressed with their customer service at this point.    Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I like the form, but it doesn&#x27;t maintain the heat as it did the first two weeks. Perhaps my unit is defective.</li>
    <li> I love the Croc...The plates run down your hair very, very smoothly and it heats up quickly.  I decided to go with the Croc because it was less expensive than the Chi, but it is definately not &#x27;cheaper&#x27;.  I have had 4 Chi&#x27;s in the past and they were used to the fullest, me and my three daughters all used it on a daily basis.  I am hoping the Croc hold up to the wear and tear a little better...we will see.  But for now, I am LOVING it :)</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE FOR MOTHERS DAY. SHE HADN&#x27;T HEARD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. BUT WHEN I TOLD HER ABOUT THE REVIEW&#x27;S THAT IT HAD, AND AFTER HER USING IT, SHE SAID SHE REALLY LOOOOOOVED THE CROC. VERY GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE, FOR SURE !!!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for a gift as she had used it before at the salon.  She really likes it.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Chi&#x27;s kill my hair, but this one has an adjustable heat setting which is perfect. Plus the plates don&#x27;t damage my hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the corners. I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Best hair iron ever!!! I have course unruly hair leaves it soft and very shinny.</li>
    <li> 3 days ago I used the hair straightener to straighten my bangs, this morning it won&#x27;t stay on. There&#x27;s some kind of problem with the cord, because if I hold it over my head while jumping up and down on my left foot and turning in a counter clockwise rotation I can get it on, but the moment I move the cord it turns right back off. I purchased this product in October 2012, and for $80 I really expected it to last me a bit longer than 11 months. While It was working, it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge dissapointment.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightner I have ever bought and I have bought a lot of straightners in my life.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener around 5 months ago and it had worked great!! I could straighten my hair within a matter of minutes. Then, after only 4 months the spring of the straightener gave out. Just the other day the entire straightener broke!! I would turn it on and the temperature was stuck on 80 degrees and then it popped up the word ERR and shut off. It has not worked since and completely wasted my money on it!! Worked great for around 3 months and could straighten the hardest to straighten hair, but did not last at all as long as I would hope it would last. If this is a straightener you will be using daily, I would NOT buy it!!! Complete rip off!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair usually takes forever to straighten. But not with this. Gets the job done quick yet very well. Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 8 months and all i can say is i wish i had this from the very beginning. it makes my hair very soft and smooth without burning it, and i only have to iron it once in between hair washes (wash my hair ever 3-4 days). it rains a lot where i live, but stays straight and soft. it takes quite a bit of humidity before i start see any friz. i love it. worth the money. i&#x27;ll never buy another cheap flat iron again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the suggestion of my salonist and it&#x27;s been one of the best purchases for my hair I could have ever made.  It arrived very quickly and I have used it twice a week every week since I have had it, which has been nearly a month now.  It heats quickly to the temp of my choosing and is light weight and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My normally overly wavy, thick and fluffy hair (think the movie Brave&#x27;s Merida, that&#x27;s my hair) is now a lot calmer and straighter.  I have gotten nothing but compliments from everybody that has known me for years on how nice it looks, and it&#x27;s now easier to maintain</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever!♡</li>
    <li> I am 46 with med. length dry, frizzy, hair that likes to curl up on its own at the ends- my morning have gotten busier &amp; I just don&#x27;t have the time for a making much effort to get the perfect hair- So I do the basic-I blow it, brush it, &amp; run out the door-  I  used to normally look ½ complete hair was clean but seemed to be all over the place (frown) Until the Croc classic came into my life-one day I thought what the heck let me try a flat iron-however since my hair is dry &amp; brittle at times I EXTENSIVLEY researched what would be the best brands would lest likely to cause hair damage- The Croc is Amazing it&#x27;s - straightens my hair in wide one strokes, without drying or burning, in minutes I am ready to run out the door but now  with PERFERCT straight Hair each time! &amp; and stays this way all day! I LOVE IT! I cannot. My advice don&#x27;t get fooled with some other (higher cost BRAND names) after extensive research I found some of them not only cost much more but there were complaints saying there iron overheated &amp; caused hair damage others were upset saying there iron didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt; I am very pleased with the Croc flat iron I Absolutely Recommend it! temp is set perfectly, holding &amp; postioning it is comfortable thus -making it a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: I did pick up the flat iron hair spray, and  a bottle of iron cleaner both were also purchased from amazon- excellent prices $$</li>
    <li> I have purchased many flatirons, but this one is by far the best one! It works wonders on my hair!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works super fast and way better than my Chi.  I bought this to replace the Chi and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say every single hair stylist I&#x27;ve ever been to has told me I have the thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever worked with.  Not only is it thick, but its coarse, curly, and dyed.  It usually would take me around 2hrs to flat iron all of my hair, but with this iron I have cut that down to 45 minutes!  And yes, the reviews are true - mine just died after having it for 2 years, but considering the time I&#x27;ve saved over these past two years and also just how well it works...I feel like it was a very worthy investment.  Especially when you look at prices of similar irons (like the GHD)  The trick is to just be sure to unplug it when you&#x27;re done (don&#x27;t just turn it off) - you&#x27;ll get a lot more life out of it.</li>
    <li> I originally received a product that was opened, and had been used, but I notified the seller and they fixed this issue immediately and sent me a new flat iron. I have used it three times and am so pleased. Unlike my previous flat iron (Chi) the ends of my hair were as silky as the rest, and I have gotten several compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic straightener. I have been using the Croc for years and have always been satisfied with it, love the digital temperature control!</li>
    <li> As a stylist comfort is very important. This iron fits well in my hand and is very easy to use. Most hair types will only need one or two passes to straighten. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these products in the last four months and both have stopped working.  They are great while they work but for this kind of money I expect a longer life.</li>
    <li> This will be my 3rd Croc.  It heats up quickly and maintains the heat.  The ceramic plates are smooth and prevent damaging my hair.  I tried a competing brand for a few months and came running back.</li>
    <li> Great easy to handle leaves hair soft and manageable</li>
    <li> I have thick, color treated hair.  This works great for my needs.  I love the quick heat-up and it has high temps.  My 21yr old liked it so much she asked me to purchase for her.  YAY...I have my 1st Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> Love! Best straightener I&#x27;ve used and the price is wonderful.</li>
    <li> When this flat iron works, it is great. I have very very coarse and frizzy hair, and I love the way this flat iron makes my hair look and feel. It hold the hair really tight which is hard to find in a flat iron. With that said, I have owned two of these. They quick working after a few months. The first time I thought it was a fluke, so I bought another one because I loved it so much. The second one did the same thing. I was traveling out of state when my second one quick working which was very stressful.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. My friend had one of these and let me use it when my other flat iron broke. I was instantly in love. I have very thick and curly hair, and this does wonders! Most people are shocked when they find out I have curly hair because my hair is always so straight from using this. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> A friend of my wife told me about it and I bought it for her as a gift. She really loves it,</li>
    <li> Broken after about 3 months of use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron get stuck at 80 degrees and displays an error message shortly after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money. Stay away from this product/manufacturer if you&#x27;re looking for something long term.</li>
    <li> I got this one for my daughter. It is exactly what is described. It is a classic one, and the price is reasonable. I requested for 2 day shipping, and exactly received it in 2 days. Great serves. So far  she is happy with it. It is a great design, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great flat iron, but it does not keep working.  I have had 2 now and both stop working after a year or so.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bough this product, because my new hair dresser was using it, and she recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;The price was OK as a product which pros use, however, I don&#x27;t like the design.&lt;br /&gt;The cord was attached to swivel around, probably the designer thought this would be helpful, WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;Because the cord constantly twirl around every time I pick up the iron, so I have to constantly unwind the cord!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the funny design of the opening, made to look like a crocodile mouth, WRONG AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;Because of the narrowed opening, it&#x27;s harder to grab hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for awhile now and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve had other straighteners that my hair would get caught in or it would singe the tips, but this straightener is amazing! I would absolutely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I Just got my croc I love the way my hair feels and love the fact its light weight. That being said it feels flimsy as soon as it hits the floor it will no doubt break into pieces :( guess I just really have to be careful with it</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron less than 2 years ago and there was a time I didn&#x27;t even use it.  It is short circuiting/ turning off several of times while trying to iron my hair.  Now it is past the warranty and I am stuck with a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after it was recommended by my hair stylist because my Chi broke.  It works really well and very quickly.  It takes me only about 8 minutes to straighten my hair.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is as close to the salon as you can get . I have thick curly hair and other straighteners I&#x27;ve used would never really quite do it. This is awesome ! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Broke after 2 uses. the cord stopped working. We returned and bought a Chi instead and it has been working great over and over. I do not recommend the CROC straightener.</li>
    <li> came a day before it said it would. its honestly an okay straightener but not super amazing. it&#x27;s at least better than my last cheap ghetto  one. With this straightener i also dropped it once and surprisingly it didn&#x27;t break so i am glad about that</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have super course curly hair and this flat iron is amazing!!! I recommend getting a flat iron spray to protect your hair from the high heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s digital temperature gauge is easy to control and change if need be. Heats up super fast too.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a month. Now it is stuck on 280degF. It will not go up or down in temperature, and it will not turn off with the on/off button. I can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit when it is first plugged in, so that is not the problem. It just will not heat up any more than 280 degF.  The seller only has a 7 day return policy if it&#x27;s unused, and when you read the hoops you have to jump through to get a factory warranty repair, it&#x27;s clear that the Croc people have designed their warranty so they never have to fix anything under their warranty -- you&#x27;ll never qualify! So I am stuck with an $80 paper weight.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Do not Waste your money buying a croc!! I&#x27;m the third person I personally know that had theirs quit right after the 1 year warranty was up!!</li>
    <li> This item is great and a great price considering the life span of a straightener.  I&#x27;ve always used cheaper ones and I feel this is worth every penny.  Shipping was fast as well!</li>
    <li> It worked for a about a year. My daughter was not overly impressed.</li>
    <li> I happened to see this product while having my hair done in an Aveda salon.  I asked my hairdresser about the flat iron and I was told that this was \\&quot;simply the best flat iron on the market.\\&quot;  I unfortunately was not able to have my hairdresser use it on my hair that day as it was raining, and once my hair gets wet, it automatically curls.  I also did not buy the flat iron because it was $200 at the salon.  So of course, I researched the iron and found it on Amazon - and at the time I was looking, which was early last spring, I found this model for $80.  I told a friend about it...and long story short...a group of my friends pitched in and bought the iron for me for my birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with my hairdresser - this is simply the best iron on the market.  I have very kinky, course, curly hair.  This flat iron not only straightens my hair within a pass or two, it STAYS straight, even after sleeping on it!  In addition, I absolutely love the fact that this is a wet/dry iron - meaning that you need not completely dry your hair before using the iron.  Actually, it is better to have your hair around 25% or more damp so that the iron can finish drying your hair and literally seal in the moisture.  This process leaves your hair very straight, soft and extremely smooth.  I can easily run my fingers through my hair without any tangling.  Many people have commented on how great my hair looks when it is straight, as well as how soft it feels when they touch it.  Several of my friends (with varying hair types) have purchased this straightener upon my recommendation and all have said that this was the best iron purchase they have made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital temperature setting is easy to use - plug in the iron, turn it on, and set the temperature.  Once the temperature is set, it remains in the memory.  So the next time you use the iron, it will automatically heat up to the last temperature setting you used.  You can go up to 450 degrees, if I recall correctly - so this iron can get very hot.  Avoid touching the actual iron pieces or you will get burned.  But it also cools relatively quickly once it is turned off - usually in five minutes or so it is cool enough to put away.  There is an automatic shut off mechanism as well if it is left on for more than 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that it will take a few uses to get used to using the iron and determining the appropriate temperature setting for you hair (for my hair type, I set it 400 degrees).  Once you get used to it and determine the best temperature setting for your hair, you will not be disappointed with this product.  It is an excellent investment for the money, especially at the prices here on Amazon.can get very hot.  Avoid touching the actual iron pieces or you will get burned.

    <li> Awesome product. Totally worth the $$$. Heats up super quick and very easy to use :)  Shipped quickly and has survived daily use plus being dropped (a lot! Oops!) and still works great :)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tool for relaxed or coarse hair.   Huge money saver and now i have no reason to wear my hair in a pony tail because i have no time or money to go to the salon. I am african-american and had to use this at 450 to get the look i wanted. Highly recommened this flat iron to all.</li>
    <li> I flat iron my hair almost daily. I have long hair and two kids. This has cut the time it takes me to get ready down by at least 20 minutes! I love this and you will too!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.  I like much better than my CHI and so much I suggested to friends who bought it too.</li>
    <li> I love this iron when it works! My first one had the spring break after about 1 year. This one started acting up after 6 months. It heats up fine but as soon as you start using it the temp drops way down and won&#x27;t heat back up unless you put it down and don&#x27;t move it! Something loose in the wiring. My moms is doing the same thing. Contacted manufacture about faulty wiring, but never got a response. Warranty not valid because I purchased on amazon and not an authorized dealer.</li>
    <li> Love croc irons,2nd one I have owned. My first one lasted two years.&lt;br /&gt;Good for fine, curly hair - easy to use.</li>
    <li> Made my wife so happy by getting this for her. She tried this product before at a friends house and said it made her hair feel and look awesome witch it did. Must have.</li>
    <li> i love the iron.  but i have bought two now and they both stopped working.  flashing error light and then shuts off, doesn&#x27;t heat up.  i called the manufacuter, and was told i had to send $15 for repair.  This is the second iron i explained, and told her they were a rip off.  i shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for an item that stops working after 2 months.  i told them they were con artists.  they told me that they wouldn&#x27;t repair.  i will never give this company a penny more of my money.</li>
    <li> i bought this product in november 2011 only to have it break in may 2012--it was great while it lasted and i even had many people comment about how awesome the flat iron was when they borrowed it. however i was really surprised/disappointed by the short life span of the product.</li>
    <li> I like that this flat iron automatically turns off after 30 minutes. It gives me peace of mind. Also, unless you have course hair.... Do not set temp above 350!!!</li>
    <li> Works great love it fast shipping</li>
    <li> Straightens my curly hair quickly and bone straight.  Heats up very fast too. It&#x27;s awsome.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is AMAZING! I don&#x27;t know why people wouldn&#x27;t want it. I bought this as a last minute thing because my old CHI broke. I will never go back to a CHI or any other flat iron for that matter. The CROC leaves my hair super straight, amazingly soft, and incredibly frizz free! I love this flat iron and would highly reccomend it to any and everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is compatible with my hair!!! Although I was very unsatisfied with how long it took the seller to ship the product, I was pretty happy with the quality of the product.  I&#x27;ve tried this product before at my Hair Stylist&#x27;s shop and I loved it. It makes my hair feel so soft and it heats up really quick.  With a Frizzy/Kinky hair I enjoy this product.  :)</li>
    <li> The best you can buy! Will smoke your hair literally and figuratively! Becareful if you don&#x27;t have thick hair because this will scorch your hair if not careful and the temp not right for your type of hair. The life expectancy of croc is ok. Look forward to replacing every two years. This is my third one in 6 years. But other irons don&#x27;t heat up and don&#x27;t run as smoothly through my hair to eliminate waves and patterns in my hair. The look lasts far longer than conventional irons. My suggestion is buy it you&#x27;re worth it and it&#x27;ll pay its self off in no time as you will reduce the number of times for a blow out or straighting session at your stylist.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and have even used it myself.  Cuts down time in half.  Nice product, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I replaced a broken HAI straightener with the Croc at the recommendation of my colorist and am not disappointed.  It came beautifully packaged and has delivered with superior performance.  I also love the rubber cord wrap.  I know it&#x27;s a silly little thing, but it helps keep my drawer looking neat.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my product it was worth the money spent on it, my hair looks great every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd turboion flat iron that I have bought- I had my other one for several years until I dropped it and the plates shifted out of line. Compared to other irons I have used, it&#x27;s great, gets up to 450 degrees. Much better than previous metal and ceramic irons I have used. My hair is straight, but thick and has a bit of frizz.</li>
    <li> this iron is stuck on 280 degress and then i rebooted it and now it only goes to 130!!! and of course warrenty is only for 2 months i am a proffessional and need to use it a lot seeems like i will be buying from a different manufactuer .</li>
    <li> Love the Croc products - can change the temperature based on touch up or full straightening!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Had one before but I broke it, now I no longer need to use a cheap flatiron.</li>
    <li> Great for Brazilan Blowouts!!!! Best investments I have made. A huge plus is I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my customers  ear&#x27;s :):):)</li>
    <li> I am in love with this flat iron!!!!!!! It is so awesome, the best flat iron I have ever had!!!!</li>
    <li> I loved how this made my hair look the few times I used it.  Then one day, I plugged it in and it simply wouldn&#x27;t heat up!  I&#x27;d read online that other people had this problem, but I assumed they traveled with it a lot or left it on all the time or dropped it.  I took meticulous care of this item!  I paid a lot for it!  It just stopped working for no apparent reason!  After the people at Croc wouldn&#x27;t talk to me because my iron was bought here, I&#x27;m very happy to say that Amazon refunded my money!!  THANK YOU for making this right, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Everything on time and as a described on image . I like it very very much. thanks a lot. Good.</li>
    <li> I really question whether this is an authentic Croc flatiron.  My flatiron stopped working after 6 months while I was on a cruise in the Caribbean!!  Worst time for this thing to break, my hair was out of control for my whole trip; I was not a happy camper.  I read the reviews about this iron breaking but I thought I would give it a try anyway, bad decision on my part.  There&#x27;s a reason this flatiron costs less than retail, and I truly feel it&#x27;s a fake...you get what you pay for.  Buyer beware!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase. Price, quality and how fast gets hot. I recommend this flat iron to all stylist.</li>
    <li> Hair comes out straighter and smoother with this iron than any other iron I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used many. I also like the extra long cord.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever used!!! It heats up really fast, it&#x27;s light weight and smooths the hair better than any other!!!</li>
    <li> I have had to purchase three of these irons in one year because they easily break. There is a manufacturing defect because Turbo Ion decided to take their manufacturing and outsource it to another country. Yes, the iron is amazing when it works. But it is not worth the money to have to constantly replace it.   [...]</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener. I&#x27;ve had many brands and this is the best one yet. The price is great too.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed.  I bought this less than month ago and have used it maybe 6 times.  I am a responsible adult who uses products carefully.  Today, when first using this iron, the iron heated up normally to 450 deg F.  I have thick, wavy hair so I need it to be that hot.  Then, after 5 minutes, a flashing white biking error light came on above the LED readout and the iron was losing heat!  I could see the degrees fall on the LED readout...it was going down on its own to 250 deg F and more.  I removed the plug, waited, and replugged and it would not heat up past 168 deg F.  Then I decided to read reviews and saw that this has happened to other people (I guess I did not read ALL of the negative reviews before buying)  It seemed like most negative reviews said it would not work after a year.  This was less than a month!  Anyway, I am returning it today.  I am somewhat sad since it did seem like a good iron initially.</li>
    <li> After being a loyal CHI user for many years, a friend introduced me to her Croc and I immediately fell in love. My hair is down to my waist and it VERY thick and VERY curly. Usually my hair takes well over and hour to straighten, but with the Croc it&#x27;s done in 20 minutes. I only have to go over each 1 inch section 1 time compared to my usual 5ish times. This is a miracle straightener!</li>
    <li> I used to use a chi until my mother in law let me borrow her croc. This is my second croc because they just don&#x27;t last foreve, and I&#x27;m still I love. I had my other one almost 4 years and it finally died. But it gets used everyday. Love love love this flat iron!</li>
    <li> This is BY FAR the best flat iron on the market! Being a professional hairdresser, I use the Croc both at the salon and at home. It leaves hair silky straight with just one go-over. I have bought many over the years for gifts, and will continue to do so!!</li>
    <li> I cannot seem to figure out how to contact this seller directly, but now it only heats up to a tempaure I can warm my hands with.  I contacted Turboion directly to confirm I could send this back and have it replaced as there should be a 1 year warranty. I received the following email from the company:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, as stated on our website on[ ... ]Croc TurboIon does NOT honor any warranty/sale from [ ... ], as these websites are selling refurbished irons and are not an authorized or legitimate sale. If you purchased from these websites, please contact them for assistance with your iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you please provide me assistance in replacing my hair iron?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;Because my order was \\&quot;Fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot; they are taking full responsibility for the product and issuing a refund!  THANK YOU AMAZON!  I will certainly continue to enjoy placing orders on your website!</li>
    <li> Croc is the best straighter available and I know I have tried them all. I have very frizzy cruly hair, and have fought it for years until I tried the croc, it took me hours to straighten my hair with known brands like chi, and other expensive brands, no amount of money was spared on my straightners, but no of them measured up to this Croc, I have had this Croc for over a year and it works great it takes me less than 15 minutes to go from frizzy to silky straight. Everyone thinks I have straight hair. Even my daughter&#x27;s modelings coach thought I had straight hair and couldn&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t had my hair professionaly straightened.  I love this Croc Straighter and so will you.</li>
    <li> It was a perfect gift for my daughter n Law</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  So easy to use  Works fast and I love the way my hair feels when I am done.</li>
    <li> I bought this very same straightener from amazon about a year ago. It works VERY well, even when I do it after I let my hair air-dry wavy. It started to short out after about a year. This made me mad, but I loved the product so much before it broke, that I bought another one just like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a less expensive zebra iron and it is much better than the croc.  It does not seem to heat up to the temp on the display.</li>
    <li> This iron works great, but my first one died after about a year. Mine does go through a lot traveling so that May have contributed to it. I did buy another one because it straightens better than all my backup Chi&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Good price. Easy to use. I will recomend it 100%&lt;br /&gt;Do not burn your hair. I would sugest you to buy the carry on bag</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, love the controlled temperature buttons, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast and does an amazing job!</li>
    <li> I got this iron on April of this year, I wanted it so much because mom has one and it really worked every time I borrowed. Got mine and worked perfectly well until today. Used to heat to 450 degrees and now it doesn&#x27;t go up to 250 degrees, still working but I don&#x27;t like it doesn&#x27;t go up anymore.</li>
    <li> I have had this product before and mine recently broke form being dropped too many times. I can&#x27;t find a better straightener than this! It is the absolute best! My hair is thick and frizzy/wavy and this straightener does the trick to get silky smooth hair!</li>
    <li> Croc&#x27;s TurboIon is my favorite and #1 go to flatiron. Its the best most efficient styling iron (with no hot spots) that offers one pass style-ability, and a  digital thermostat/heats to 450 degrees nearly instantly. It adds beautiful silky shine,  and managability to even the most unruly overly curly course hair instantly. Makes doing your hair at home so easy to master!</li>
    <li> Better than expected!  Straightens thick, wavy hair in no time.  Hair turns out shiny too.  After reading reviews, I don&#x27;t use it turned up to the hottest temperature and it still works beautifully. Price was much better than at the salon.  Would definately recommend it.  Amazon also shipped it very quickly during holiday season.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a month and then stopped holding temp would only heat to 140 or not heat at all.  Seemed cheaply constructed.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have purchased around 6 of these Crocs in the past few years. I had to switch to a different flat iron because it always stops working within a few months. I dont use it daily and when I do use it, its only for 15 min. as good as it is when it works it always stops working.</li>
    <li> BEST flat iron EVER. This is my second croc, doubt I will use another brand again. Also glad I found it for cheaper than $130 on Amazon!! :)</li>
    <li> I have finally given up on croc, after purchasing three croc straighteners in a row (because they really are amazing) I am finally fed up because each of them have broken in just over a year. The warranty is only good for a year anyways and they don&#x27;t recognize amazon as a proper seller so even if it breaks sooner your out of luck. If your okay with buying a new straighter every year then this is the one for you, but if you would rather buy a quality product that lasts then avoid this straightener.</li>
    <li> This is my second one I&#x27;ve owned. (Guess I dropped my first one too many times.) I love the larger-than-most ceramic plates. Great adjustable heat settings. Easy on the hair. Great product introduced to me by my hair stylist. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this Iron gives a smooth straight finish.  Love it much and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it, have very thick and wavy hair. This flat iron is the best.... Keeps my hair straight for days!</li>
    <li> First off if you are debating on getting this, GET IT! I have been flat ironing for years and this is by far the best one! I was very loyal to my chi but after numerous ones malfunctioning due to the cord wear (no I did not wrap the cord) I decided on trying this. I have since had a couple others that I got as promos or gifts and it never beats the croc. It heats up super quick and maintains the heat temp while using and the wider plates cuts the process time in half. The results are awesome! I live in a humid climate and this iron leaves my hair frizz free till the next wash. Also creates the nicest curls!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. Digital read out to 450 and heats up in seconds. I use this as my daily hair regimen for a polished sleek staight look. This straightener is legit.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the iron. It works much better than the CHI and HAI anf FHI ones that I owned before. Heat up very quick.&lt;br /&gt;One problem. The power cord connection broke less than a year. Because I bought it via Amazon, it&#x27;s not Croc&#x27;s authorized dealer, they do not accept it for warranty repair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE IT!! I&#x27;ve had my share of flat irons, and thought the CHI was one of the best, but after using the CROC I&#x27;ve been wrong! I definitely recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my hair stylist.  It works great and heats up fast. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. This is an exceptional flat iron and heats up in just seconds. Makes your hair feel great. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Heats up quickly and does a nice job. Doesn&#x27;t fry your hair or pull at it.</li>
    <li> This is the  straightener I have  ever had. It heats up quickly and is easy to handle.  I also love being able to control the temperature .</li>
    <li> Croc stopped working early last month. I tried to find someone to fix it but I have been unsuccessful. I would like to exchange it.</li>
    <li> Had  this used on my hair at the salon and got the same results at home! When does that ever happen?! So happy!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  She is impressed by how quickly she can straighten her very curly hair with this one compared to the others she has used.</li>
    <li> Really like this straightener! Heats up quite quickly and hot. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s damaging my hair either. Happy I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changed my review from 4 to 5 stars because as of today I have officially been using my trusty straightener for over a year and a half! I used to have to replace my straightener yearly and that&#x27;s no longer the case. It&#x27;s been all over the world with me :)</li>
    <li> This product has gone the distance and some not one single issue to date&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair that is hard and very time consuming to straighten, not with this one! I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;And recommend it to all my friends,</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace a flat iron I had that was well over 5 years old. I did a lot of research and decided on the croc iron, I have to say it saved me about 10 minutes on my hair, and my hair looked like I had left the salon. Very light weight and easy to use. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works excellent. Replaced a 1&amp;#34; Croc Flat Iron. Would rather have had a slimmer one, but this one works well.</li>
    <li> SOOOOOO disappointed!! I bought this straightener very wary about the reviews on here that say it stops working after awhile. I figured people were just dropping it or something. BOY WAS I WRONG. My straightener sits on my bathroom counter every single day and is unplugged when I&#x27;m not using it.  It worked perfect yesterday and this morning it just says ERROR and turns off. I am soooo upset and disappointed. WASTE OF MONEY!! I will be emailing amazon, the seller, and the company of this product. That is not acceptable and I find it way too coincidental that after 4-6 months, they stop working just as many other people said on here. That is NOT ok. I have had my chi for 3 years and it has been traveling everywhere with me and still works perfect!! &#x3D;(( I&#x27;m so sad &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter, she had one that burned out and really wanted another.  It arrived in time for Christmas and&lt;br /&gt;works great,  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> A GIFT FOR MY 17 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO STRAIGHTENS HER HAIR DAILY.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!  HEATS QUICKLY AND TAKES LITTLE TIME TO DO THE JOB.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> As many of the other reviewers have clearly stated, this Croc flat iron will break after a couple months of use. Mine was purely adult owned and operated, and only used about 2 times a week. After about 3 months, it was unable to get warmer than 280 degrees, which is pretty much worthless. I highly encourage you to scan the hundreds of reviews for this model flat iron, as you will discover this exact flaw has happened for many, many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon nor the manufacturer would accept it as a return, as 3 months had passed. $73 lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned.</li>
    <li> omg. omg omg. this thing is seriously amazing. if you read reviews on here that say its the only straightner that makes it look like you have a perm in your hair theyre right. i put it on 420 (if youre white you probably dont need all that heat but i do) and it does wonders. heats up much faster than my old straightner which took about 5 minutes didnt let you pick a degree just low medium or high sure my old straightner for 20 bucks gets your hair pretty straight but not like this. its perfect. spend a little extra if you want your hair to look extra good.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling silky.</li>
