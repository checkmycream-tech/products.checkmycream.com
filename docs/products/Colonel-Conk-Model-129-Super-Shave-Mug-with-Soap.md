      <li>Had I looked more closely, I would not have purchased it.</li>
      <li>Thought this would allow for the soap to sit in the mug and create the lather on top of the soap.</li>
      <li>This is a soap so lather is more of trick than a cream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The mug came without soap inside and no lid.  A separate plastic container (very small) of soap came, but you cannot put the soap in the mug.</li>
    <li> It is just the mug I have been looking for for quite some time.  It awaits my second use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mug to replace a long standing coffee mug I was using for my soap. It&#x27;s getting harder to find soaps at retail stores as well and most of what the drugstores carry locally is cheap stuff designed for beginners. My 16 year old son and I both use a mug and brush so I wanted to get something that looked nicer in our bathroom and felt the soap included with it would be a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug arrived well packaged and with a cake of the Almond soap from Colonel Conk. The soap is some of the best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: This mug is called \\&quot;Super\\&quot; for a reason. It&#x27;s 3\\&quot; diameter is larger than most normal mugs and the soap you buy from most places is roughly 2\\&quot; or less in  diameter. In fact, the soap included with this purchase is the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; size but if you search here, you will see that Colonel Conk&#x27;s does make a \\&quot;super\\&quot; size cake that&#x27;s bigger, is designed for this mug, and will obviously last longer. No matter, you can still use smaller soaps but you&#x27;ll have to work them a bit since they might slide a bit in the mug at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a mug and brush guy or want to get this for someone who is, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong here. I&#x27;ll be buying more stuff from Colonel Conk&#x27;s when I&#x27;m due.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product. It is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time. The Col. Conk mug is large enough to accomondate any size soap from almost every shave soap maker known. However, I use the Col. Conk shave soaps Amber, Bay Rum, and Lime.  They may be a little more expensive than most other shave soaps but they are worth every penny.  Pair this mug and the Col. Conk soaps with a nice badger brush and you will enjoy an old fashion shaving experience every morning.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Excellent.</li>
    <li> The soap was mediocre and the mug is poorly designed. A shaving bowl should be, well, a bowl. The round bottom makes it easier to mix the soap and water with your shave brush. This massive mug is too large and the angles at the bottom are to sharp to easily work up a lather, either with a soap puck or cream. Do yourself a favor and get a bowl. Seriously, any small bowl will do.</li>
    <li> I expected the final product to look a little more like the photo. The soap is a standard size, unfortunately that is much smaller than the cup, and the cup is so large that I am considering going back to my standard coffee cup. I  like the soap, but would not purchase the pair again, the cup is a waste of money, since it so significantly outsizes the soap.</li>
    <li> After deciding to return to soap and brush shaving, I purchased this particular item.  Although the mug is hefty and perfect for working up a nice lather, the incorrect soap was included.  The product description says \\&quot;unscented glycerin soap\\&quot;.  What I got in my package was a funky almond scented regular shaving soap.  Yeccchhh.  It smells like I&#x27;m shaving with marzepan.  Will keep the mug, but am throwing out the soap.</li>
    <li> Part of this might be preference, but I prefer a heavy weight mug/bowl to shave with.  If I heat the cup well the lather stays warm throughout the entire shave.    This product is very light weight and fragile feeling.  Where the handle is attached to the mug body there are holes, and the glaze seems cracked.    Col. Conk soap is some of the best, so the purchase was not a complete bust, but the mug is worthless, I get a better shave out of a $1 coffee mug from Wal-mart.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed using this mug with some almond soap to whip up a nice lather for my first DE shave.  Kinda pricey, but I do not think it would break if knocked in the sink lightly.  I recommend to anyone who wants a well made shaving mug.</li>
    <li> Great gift idea for anyone that shaves.  The soap is good but the scent reminds me of wet lambskin (I have a car shami that&#x27;s lambskin and that&#x27;s how I know what that smells like).  I recommend Col Conk Bay Rum scent as an alternative OR use Tea Tree conditioner.  I have thick Latino hair and the tea tree conditioner is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.  Back to the mug...I&#x27;ve microwaved water in it and it&#x27;s been fine. I recommend removing the soap after every use as there is a concave ring towards the bottom of the mug that when left unclean could be a pain to clean.</li>
    <li> Awesome shave mug.  Lathers well.  About the thickness of a coffee cup &amp; it has brushes as the print around the base if that&#x27;s hard to tell.  Has survived a drop or two to the sink.</li>
    <li> This mug is perfect for whipping up a super lather. I recommend filling your sink with hot water along with the inside of the mug then take a shower poor out the water and mix your lather in a nice warm mug so your lather is nice and warm as well. It is also a durable mug, my cat knocked it into the sink and it didn&#x27;t even chip.</li>
    <li> Very good smooth soap, and a very nice mug. Would have been nice to have a lid for the mug.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this cup, stays in place while I swirl my brush around, looks great although most soaps are a smaller diameter, but stay in the cup if you leave some of the packaging on the soap.</li>
    <li> Great mug!  Works like it should.  I like that it is shorter and not very deep.  Much better than the coffee mug I was using.</li>
    <li> Decent enough mug. Fits the larger col. conk soap cakes. Bigger than I&#x27;d anticipated; other soap cakes almost get lost in it.     If the mug were slightly smaller and heavier (thicker), I think it&#x27;d hold heat longer and keep the lather warmer.</li>
    <li> The image looks small - like a regular cup of coffee - BEWARE this thing is HUGE! Definitely returning! Not as pictured the soap is lost somewhere in the cavernous bottom of this huge bucket!</li>
    <li> The Mug-   No real frame of reference here since this is part of the first wet shave kit I&#x27;ve put together but it seems to be useful for it&#x27;s intended purpose. Nice and wide so you can really swish it around and work up a good lather. Depth seems good too, keeps the mess contained but not so deep you have to reach very far into it. Wide base balances it pretty well when I set it on the side of the sink.     The soap-  Was shipped with the almond shaving soap. I like it a lot. It smells good, lathers up well. I have to be careful not to use too much or too little water to get the consistency right but from what I have read this is typical.</li>
    <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t smell  fantastic, but it lathers well and the mug is a decent size.</li>
    <li> Seems like a sturdy mug, good weight and size. Came with almond soap, rather than the amber in the picture,</li>
    <li> I switched to this mug from a metal bowl due to the chemical reaction possible with a metal mug. This works very well for just about any size soap you get I just didn&#x27;t realize how big it was. I kept my last bowl in the shallow vanity above my sink this mug is way to big for that. It seems sturdy enough and easy to hold also does a much better job of getting a good foam going rather then splashing over like my last bowl did. Mine came with the almond colonel conk soap which is the blandest of the ones I have tried but probably your safest bet.</li>
    <li> Good quality product.  I am using the mug, but have not tried the soap that came with it.  I am currently using some olive oil soap from France.  The mug is perfect size for creating lather with a shaving brush.  Buy with confidence and enjoy the improved shaving experience.</li>
    <li> First of all this mug is of great quality like many other buyers have noted. its sturdy and has a great weight to it Im very glad I purchased it and know I will get many years of service out it if. This is my first Colenel Conk soap and I found its latter very good and provided a good shave. I will definitely be ordering more Col Conk soaps in the future&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;First I find it very chincy that its a Super puck mug and they send you a standard sided soap I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more and gotten the proper sized soap for the mug.... but it kind of worked out ok frankly I dont find the &amp;#34;Amber&amp;#34; scent that it comes with very appealing so im glad it is a smaller soap so I dont have to deal with it as long. but for those that do like the soap I think they would have preferred the larger size.</li>
    <li> This shaving mug is huge. Great to lather shaving cream or hold your col conk large puck of shaving soap. Classic design.</li>
    <li> Nice big mug. Look foward to shaving every morning. Comes with the shave soap, nice bonus! Should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to traditional shaving and this was the first mug I picked up.  Based on other reviews, it was well constructed and a nice quality mug.  That was very true.  I thought it would be around the size of a coffee mug, but it&#x27;s more the size of a latte mug.  Good size to work a nice lather.  Coming with a cake of Colonel Conk soap was nice too.  This is a well-crafted mug and I&#x27;m happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this mug. I ended up getting the Bay Rum scent when I thought I would be getting an unscented puck of soap and I love it. All the recommendations I got to try Colonel Conk shaving soap were very reliable. It lathers very well and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems with ingrown hairs, razor burn, or acne since switching. I like to soak the mug in hot water while I&#x27;m showering and it does a pretty good job of holding heat so i get a nice warm lather for my shave.</li>
    <li> Works well, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice shave mug that will give you plenty of room to mix your lather without clanking your badger brush and making lots of noise. The soap itself is OK. Shave soaps are a matter of personal preference. For me, Col Conk&#x27;s dry my face out too much although it does produce a very nice lather for a very close and comfortable shave. That part was great but the afte effect of dry and tight skin was not so great.</li>
    <li> Mine came with almond soap, which seems to lather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug, however, is the point of this review. This baby is solid, I&#x27;ve been a little fumble fingered, but it survived unscathed. For the most part, it&#x27;s easy to hold, until your hands get soapy. That&#x27;s not a fault of the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s decent looking enough to leave on the sink counter. There are more contemporary soap dishes, marble and so forth, but this has a handle. The handle is what has saved it for me, and my fumbles.</li>
    <li> Great shaving mug - just the right size.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now.  I had a red patch on my chin that would not clear up.  I switched to shaving soap and my face is clearing up.  I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s due to the fact there is no alcohol in the shaving soap like there is in shaving cream.  Plus, it&#x27;s fun!</li>
    <li> This is a very large mug.  The soap does not fit in as shown in the picture.  The handle seems flimsy for the size of it.  On the positive side, it has a broad base which makes it very sturdy.  It doesn&#x27;t slip or slide on the counter and doesn&#x27;t need to be picked up.</li>
    <li> The Colonel Conk Model 129 Super Shave Mug with Soap (soap with this mug came in almond) is big enough to handle the &amp;#34;LARGE SIZE Colonel Conk World&#x27;s Famous SUPER BAR Shaving Soap BAY RUM 3.75 Oz made in USA&amp;#34;. The mug is so big that the shave soap has room to move around whilst getting the lather up. Not a big problem, just thought I would mention that. This mug is bigger than my Burma shave mug, but I have retired that mug for the time being. Due to its size, the Colonel Conk Model 129 Super Shave Mug takes up a little more room in my medicine cabinet, but I can still close the door.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem recommending this mug or the large size Colonel Conk World&#x27;s Famous SUPER BAR Shaving Soap BAY RUM 3.75 Oz made in USA.</li>
    <li> I’ve had the mug and soap for 7 months and I still have soap left! I like being able to put my finger in the handle, it defiantly makes it easier to hold onto. The mug is nice and wide so with my big hands I can easily work up lather.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the design on the cup, when looking at it online. I was afraid it would be too bland looking. Now that I have it, I really like it. It&#x27;s nice looking and I like the design on it a lot. It wound up complimenting my other accessories on my counter quite well. Had it been busier looking, it would have looked weird on my counter with dark accessories. This would fit in well with pretty much any color scheme you have going on. If you care about such things. It&#x27;s pretty good size. It came with the big 3.75 oz soap. Mine came with Almond scent, which I was sure I would hate. Surprise! I really like it a lot. Which is good, because I have a huge cake of it. lol As others have noted, the smaller soaps work fine in it. I just wet the bottom of the cake and stick in on the bottom of the mug. Works for me. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Received item in just a couple days, I am very pleased with it, and looks great on my sink area, very well made would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really small and the soap is not as slick as other brands. You have to lather, shave, lather and shave again. Other brands I can lather once and keep shaving.</li>
    <li> The mug with soap has too high of a price tag. The soap alone costs $5.39 on Amazon, which means the remaining ~$16 is the cost of the mug and that&#x27;s quite high. Instead go to a local thrift shop where you&#x27;ll find PLENTY of ceramic mugs/bowls of the appropriate size for just a buck. If you want the vessel to fit a Colonel Conk soap (w/o the plastic) remember that it&#x27;s got a diameter of roughly 3.5 inches. Just make sure the mug/bowl has got sufficiently high walls so you can build your lather.</li>
    <li> This is a great combo kit soap feels great slides like butter</li>
    <li> My Husband loves this. Says it gives him a much wetter lather than what comes out of a can. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> The mug is alright, but it is hard to get a good lather since the opening is so small even with small hands. The soap isn&#x27;t bad either, but I will try a tube shave soap next time.</li>
    <li> Great shaving mug/ did not receive a lid.</li>
    <li> The smell is fine, not too strong. The soap leaves a film on my face after shaving that is tough to remove. It tends to dry out my skin some. I get razor burn with this stuff and it does not lather up well enough with my synthetic bristle brush. I will not be buying this again. The cup is nice but it is huge. The soap is wider than others out there but even so the cup is even wider.</li>
    <li> The mug itself is as described and works well.  However, I never received the free soap as advertised.  I&#x27;d rate this higher if I actually received what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After contacting Amazon by email they promptly responded within an hour.  They immediately shipped a new mug with soap at no charge.  All I had to do was ship the mug I previously received back to them at no cost to me.  Excellent service like this is the reason why I&#x27;ll be a life long customer!  This is now a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> It did say super mug, but I wished it would have fit a standard size 2.25 oz. soap, the soap kind of gets lost in the mug. It does have great styling though.</li>
    <li> I bought this mug because of the style and shape. It&#x27;s just to big for my use and takes up counter space.</li>
    <li> I collect shaving mugs(and soaps),and received this Colonel Conk model as a gift some time ago.  Shaving mugs have a pretty wide range of designs and styles, considering they all are pretty much created for the same purpose.  Any mug that is a little on the wide and deep side can double as a shaving mug when there isn&#x27;t anything more formal around. And there is no question that they can come in a whole lot cheaper than this one. But a solid well designed mug like the Colonels model here is a fine example of getting a simple idea just about as perfect as it can come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model 129 is very solidly built, (a lot of them are not, drop them once on the sink and that is all she wrote).  Its just deep enough to handle about any kind or style soap that you happen to have in mind or favor, but not so deep that you end up sticking half your hand inside to get at the lather. It has a good solid comfortable handle that will not slip out of your grip easily, and lastly this mug is a very attractive one at that.  It has a nice modern feel to it as far as convenience, but most definitely has an old style handlebar mustache barbershop look to it overall.  The simple design is handsome without being overdone, and the mug itself is made of a rich looking white bone china.  Although I do not favor the Colonel Conk shaving soap as my personal favorite, it is certainly not a cheap blend.  It has a very masculine fragrance, lathers richly, and comes in at 3 3/4 oz in size, one of the biggest cakes you will find at retail. (For a really super variety of shaving soaps mostly all home made I suggest checking out the wares on Ebay.  They have the biggest variety of fragrances, style, sizes, and prices around anywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you happen to be one of the few vanishing breed of men that still favor a mug and brush, or know a man that is and have in mind this mug as a gift, I strongly recommend this fine Colonel Conk model that comes complete with a cake of their soap.  Personally I much prefer this mug over the other Colonel model available here on Amazon that has a knob on the side as opposed to a handle.  The knob may look cool, but when your hands are wet and soapy its far easier to lose the grip on the knob than it is to let go of this handle.  Believe me, I know from experience!  Overall a fine handsome mug at a good price that would make the perfect addition to your gear, or as a gift.  It&#x27;s not one you will just display but enjoy using.

    <li> Yes,  my husband liked it very much. I thought the soap in it was very small! But it was fine.</li>
    <li> good mug. soap fits easily into mug. good quality. good delivery. all ok</li>
    <li> I ordered a cream colored mug with a design on it. I received a blue mug that doesn&#x27;t really resemble the shape in the picture and has no design. The mug is fine and I have no problem with it, but be wary of this if you are trying match colors to your other bath elements. Would otherwise give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is a little maddening, in that it is just enough wider than the soap that all the foam falls down the side and I have a hard time getting at it. I put in the microwave for 30 sec. and it melted the soap so it molds to the mug as it hardens - problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the almond soap with avocado oil. Will order more of that.</li>
    <li> Many Mugs are too deep or not wide to accept a soap Puck but the Super Shave has solved these issues. Just drop the soap wet the top ans build the lather with the brush of choice. also gone is the problem of the lather escaping up and over the side!!!! Would Highly recommend this item to all shavers</li>
    <li> I like the size of the mug, plenty of room to work up a good lather</li>
    <li> It is a little bigger around than I would have expected, given the size of the soap puck, but it works just fine.</li>
    <li> use every day best purchase ever</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this shaving mug I compared it to others on this site and read the reviews.  One review said the mug was too large and the regular size soap was too small for it.  I disagree.  The soap is fine and sticks to the bottom anyway.  Because the mug is so wide, it makes it much easier to get a good lather up without waking up the whole house clanking away.  The mug is light but sturdy; I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> The soap setting in the top of the illustration made me think the mug had a lid.  I guess I should have looked closer.&lt;br /&gt;Without a lid, just any old mug will do for this purpose.  Had I looked more closely, I would not have purchased it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the amount of soap provided and the fact the lid is just throw away, thin plastic Very little value for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this is a specialty mug for shaving. Its of nice quality, but it&#x27;s huge. It&#x27;s like one of those oversized bowl mugs you get at some independent coffeeshops. I actually have two Col. Conk shaving soap pucks in mine, at the same time, and it&#x27;s still larger than it needs to be. The diameter is half again larger than it needs to be, so the soap pucks slop around in the bottom. When I find something better I&#x27;ll retire this one and use it for soup bowl.</li>
    <li> Too Deep...Could not find a longer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others here said it was too big and got taken to the cleaners with not helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT mine that it is too large. I want something extra large.&lt;br /&gt;But it is too deep. I have three brushes and with all of them, I have to put my finders INSIDE the bowl to stir or whip.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a FOUR STAR if someone would have a five inch long badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;Merkru has one but it is over $110.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With  my fingers inside the rim, it was too difficult to whip and it HURT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some large chili bowls with a stick handle (stoneware). They hold about the same amount as this cup, but don&#x27;t limit my ability to reach inside and get some action going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I wanted to like it, but some of you will appreciate the truth or let me know where the extra long brushes can be bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased from ebay a longer badger brush made by Colonel Conk for $28.&lt;br /&gt;This should help, but I had to let viewers know that your finger will be inside the cup to stir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colonel Conk Wood Handle Shaving Brush Pure Badger Total Length 5-1/2 inches&lt;br /&gt;SKU: cc344&lt;br /&gt;I just found this brush somewhere else for $23 and $3 shipping at some knife center online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/14/2014&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the larger brush and DO NOT like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s NOT just a LONGER brush, it&#x27;s also a bigger HEAD on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is too big and the hair is uncomfortable on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a LONGER brush handle, with a typical badger hair brush of normal size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I JUST WANT MY FINGERS OUTSIDE THE BOWL WHEN STIRRING.</li>
    <li> This is a huge mug.  Very well built and will last a long time if you take care of it.  The mug came with the large size Amber shaving soap.  The soap is excellent...probably the best I have ever used.  Excellent product and arrived fast!</li>
    <li> Now this was a good value for your money, for a change. Large mug with the large size shaving soap. Good, clean lather; but don&#x27;t get it in your eyes - it burns.</li>
    <li> This mug is really thin and light weight, not what I expected from some other reviews. The handle is hollow. I would not buy this if I had held it in my hands first. I&#x27;m using it to hold random stuff until it breaks or gf tosses it.</li>
    <li> i bought this mug with soap after deciding to go from canned shaving gel, to shaving soap and brush. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the style and size of the mug. It&#x27;s large and has no problem with any size shaving soaps. Nice handle makes it easy to hold as you lather the soap. Had never tried any brand of shaving soap being new to the whole thing. I did review online some brands and heard great things about Colonel Conk. It was the main reason I bought this product. The soap lathers up great and the smell is fresh and clean. If your looking for a mug and soap, look no further.</li>
    <li> From a personal anecdote of a friend, I decided to pick up the old safety razor and an apothecary mug to shave the old fashioned way.  Always heard it was preferable to disposable razors, or cartridges.  The mug itself is fantastic, and comes with a small container of glycerin shave soap.  Although I didn&#x27;t care much for the soap, personally, I was able to give it to my previously mentioned friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly doesn&#x27;t detract from the value of the purchase, however.</li>
    <li> I use it everytime I shave. The mug is hard to get a good lather in as it is small for my hand to make a good lather in, but the soap is incredible. It gives a great foamy lather, easy to spread around the face.</li>
    <li> After my very first use I was washing the thing out and bumped it against the faucet. The thing cracked halfway down to the base. I am going to still use it, but its really annoying that it couldn&#x27;t withstand a simple bump. There is not a lot of heft to this thing and if I had to do it over again I would buy something else. This does not feel like a quality or durable product. The soap is decent.</li>
    <li> I really just needed a mug, the soap was a very nice touch though.  Soap is very nice, and smells great.  The mug is the perfect size for the soap, and it seems very light, yet it is very sturdy(I already knocked it against my faucet pretty hard, and it would have chipped or broke a lesser mug, came through with no damage.)  I think between the couple of Colonel Conk products I have tried out so far, they have won a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This soap and mug combo is awesome.  Colonel Conk soap is by far the best shave soap I have ever used.  I have a pretty tough beard and sensitive skin and shave a few times a week.  This stuff won&#x27;t dry out your skin either which is important when wet shaving.  I use an Edwin Jagger safety razor and Parker badger hair brush.  This soap makes my razor glide over my beard and minimizes nicks.  This stuff is legit and I would recommend it to anyone who wet shaves or is either considering wet shaving.  I highly recommend this soap and mug combo.  Just make sure you have a good brush because it really makes a difference in your shave.</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy mug and amazing smelling soap!!!!! That with the boar bristle brush make an incredible lather!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the look and the scent. The mug is short enough that you don&#x27;t have to shove your hand down into it to make your lather but not too short. Perfect set for the collection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a crack running down the edge of the mug to it&#x27;s bottom.  I&#x27;m not sure when it happened as it only shows up when it&#x27;s had a chance to soak up some water.  This mug is made from a really light weight ceramic so the damage may have occurred during shipping or from hitting my brush on the side or setting the mug down on my counter top.  I&#x27;m still using the mug as it doesn&#x27;t leak, but I don&#x27;t expect it to last much longer.  Most smaller pucks are going to slide around in the mug as it was designed for larger refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap I received with this the the amber glycerine soap.  It&#x27;s got a nice light scent, lathers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t sting like the Edwin Jagger soap I bought at the same time.  The lather the soap makes feels very slick.</li>
    <li> I recently started shaving with brush and mug and have really enjoyed this product. I saw this as a recommended product and decided to give it a shot. I can&#x27;t be more pleased. I&#x27;ll be a Col. Conk loyalist for now on!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a bigger mug. It goes great with the long handled col conk badger shave brush.</li>
    <li> The Colonel Conk Model 129 Super Shave Mug with Soap is very nostalgic, esthetically pleasing and durably manufactured. The basic design in white bone china is classic. I like to lather up with a mug and brush and have been doing so for years. I have a small collection of shaving mugs and shaving brushes and I continue to add to them from time to time. The Colonel Conk Model 129 is a great find.</li>
    <li> The mug works great for making lather, the soap smells kind of weird. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but there saw a lingering scent. Not bad, just a little odd.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap along with my Parker shaving brush.  I was not sure how the soap would work but decidede to give it a try....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i could not be more pleased with the ingredients as was as how much lather it would create.  i comes in various flavors and i intend to try them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaving product...i intend to make this my regular brand for shaving. Denver</li>
    <li> The mug is large enough for the bigger soaps but not overly so that the normal size doesn&#x27;t fit well.  The soap itself was decent.  It was the first soap I tried so I don&#x27;t know much about the other ones but for the price I felt like I definitely got my moneys worth.  I would highly recommend for someone wanting to get started with old school shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to purchase a badger brush and pre-shave oil to get the full effect.</li>
    <li> MEETS ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT I LIKE.  THE HANDLE LETS YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL IN HOLDING THE MUG WITHOUT LOSING THE BALANCE OF IT.  I&#x27;M COMPLETELY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.  THIS IS A ITEM THAT COMPLETES MY &amp;#34;TOOLS&amp;#34; IN THE DOUBLE EDGE RAZOR SHAVING EXPERIENCE.  THANKS COLONELCONK FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;  MARVIN------DAVENPORT, IOWA</li>
    <li> I like this mug and love the soap. The mug isn&#x27;t too heavy, and it&#x27;s big enough for the larger (3-3/4 oz.) soaps. It seems sturdy enough and is easy to handle. I read that many people had cracks in their mugs, but mine came intact and seems to be doing fine. It&#x27;s large enough to allow the brush to fan and swirl well for making a thick, luxurious lather. I don&#x27;t add water directly into the mug, but wet my brush and make my lather that way. I never have extra water in the mug and always have a perfect lather. Of course part of that is the soap.. I received the 3-3/4 Oz. amber soap as described, I love it. Smooth, soft and thick foam. Great for shaving! Leaves my skin clean and no residue, rinses without leaving any oily feeling. I am going to be using this soap for a long time. I am very happy with the scent and my wife loves it too!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these</li>
    <li> Definitely a cool shave mug! Very nice large sized mug with plenty of room to make/ pick up soap. Have used and still use other smaller mugs, though this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I got him a razor for Christmas so I got him the other item to go with them he like them</li>
    <li> I recently decided to alter my shaving routine since I now shave my head.  I found my previous style of shaving (using barbasol and Gillete Fusion) was simply not working, leaving me with too many cuts and requiring a long time.  Since I was not prepared to change razors at this point, I opted for a hybrid approach of using shaving soap, a brush, and mug along with the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth is any mug that will fit your soap will work and you only need a brush and the shaving soap.  However, being new, I splurged on the Colonel Conk Model 129.  The mug is just fine. It is solidly built, has a handle instead of a knob, does not slip out of my hand, and fits the Colonel Conk soap perfectly.  I am using a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] (least expensive decent brush I could find to start) and the Brush seems to be just about made for the mug. Since the soap came with the mug, it obviously fits.  However, a friend of mine who has been doing this a while said the mug will fit just about any size soap he has seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whipping up a really good lather will take some practice. Like another reviewer, I fill both the cup and sink with hot water, leeaving the soap in the mug, then pour out the water and whip up a warm lather.  This seems to work best for me.  I find the soap very pleasant but honestly thought it would be easier to create a lather.  It took me at least 4 attempts.  I ended up checking out some videos on Youtube to get a better idea of what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself has a great fragrance and definitely works better than any other shaving cream I have ever used.  I cannot believe I did not try this sooner. It&#x27;s just a much better shaving experience by any measure.</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad who wanted to go back to the barbership feel.  He absolutely loves the mug and uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. Hot lather for shaving!</li>
    <li> If you are new to straight razor shaving, this is a great combo for soap and mug. The Col. Conk shave soap is awesome. I used &amp;#34;can goo&amp;#34; for a while with my double edge razor, and while it got the job done, upgrading the shave soap provided a much better shave and treatment of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is nice, I just wish it were thicker. You can honestly just use a regular coffee mug to create a good lather, but this mug is short which makes it better to use with a brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Colonel Conk soap and mugs for years. The soap is easy on sensitive skin and smells good, too.</li>
    <li> I liked that it was a combo. The soap almond scent is really sweet but doesn&#x27;t stick around to much, especially with an aftershave. This is a soap so lather is more of trick than a cream. But with a decent brush I was able to whip up a lather in a reasonably amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Super Shave Mug&amp;#34; is a real disappointment. Thought this would allow for the soap to sit in the mug and create the lather on top of the soap. It&#x27;s a good size but the angles of the cup and depth makes it hard to get my girly hand and Omega brush in there to spin around. I could see leaving the soap in there to load the brush, then create the lather in a bowl. I&#x27;m using a cheap bowl from IKEA that works perfectly for creating lather. It&#x27;s just as easy to leave the soap in it&#x27;s plastic container to load the brush then move to the bowl. The mug is not needed. Bowls are the way to go.</li>
    <li> This soap smells.  Has a distinctive unwanted musky smell.  I does not produce much lather and what it does produces dries rather quickly.  Went back to my can of barbsol.</li>
    <li> The mug is plenty big enough and the product is refreshing and works well. I used some old fashion shaving foam with my safety razor, and it did not quite match up as well as the safety razor with the Colonel Conk lather.</li>
    <li> great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Much bigger than I anticipated.  It&#x27;s almost too big in my opinion.  The mug is much lighter in weight than I would prefer and seems a bit on the cheap side for the price paid.  Ordered a different one and am much happier with it.</li>
    <li> My husband was using a regular coffee mug for his shaving brush &amp; was always complaining cause it wasn&#x27;t big enough for the brush. He loves this one! It&#x27;s not too tall, but still has a handle to hold on to. Much better soap than what you find in the grocery store too!</li>
