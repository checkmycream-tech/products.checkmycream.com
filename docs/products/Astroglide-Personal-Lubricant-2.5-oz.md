<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works as expected. Trusted product for many years</li>
    <li> I am a porn producer, so I know lubrication. Tried a bunch, this is the one. I only wish it came in a gallon jug.</li>
    <li> do you really want play time interrupted by a lube which gives out before you do?  Do you really need to be sore for 2 days due to an underperforming lube?  We haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> This one really works. But it is Glycerin based so any spills are difficult to remove. Be sure to clean up any spills quickly.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2.5 oz and I received 5.0 oz. and for the amount of bottles the expiration date is to close. They expire in 2014. Product 3 star</li>
    <li> enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Have used this product for quite a while and we love it................  Way better than KY products...  Worth it!!</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to brand for years.  Works great, cleans up easy.  What else is there to say? ;)</li>
    <li> This lube is the best for personal pleasuring. My wife doesn&#x27;t care much for it because she says it gives her a burning sensation down there. But no problems for me here. Great for going solo!</li>
    <li> Being able to purchase these products and just about anything these days, for next to prices or less than what the big box stores offer is an eye opener. IF you calculated your fuel and time it takes to shop the traditional way you could easily spend an extra 20% on your purchases. Just the time alone is worth the shopping experience. Amazon is a very trustworthy resource for me and my family.</li>
    <li> The lube seems to come out even though there aren&#x27;t any cracks and the cap is tightly sealed. Skip this and try your local sex shop instead.</li>
    <li> Very thin, watery fluid which is very slippery, but QUICKLY dries and becomes very sticky.  Not at all good for the intended purpose.</li>
    <li> Astroglide is pretty much the best lube we&#x27;ve ever used.  We&#x27;ve paid many times more for MANY that do not work as well.  Will continue to purchase and use Astroglide and highly recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> In the past we have paid much more at our local drug store for this product.  The price at Amazon is reasonable.  Based on my limited research I estimate that one 5 oz bottle provides lubrication for 30-35 sessions, with one, mono-orgasmic female partner..........That is with application to penis only and insertion into vagina.</li>
    <li> Astroglide always performs excellently! Non-staining, no taste, washes off completely with warm or cold water. I have tried lots and lot of brands, this one is always the best!</li>
    <li> Better than K-Y.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> Slipping and sliding all night lol love this product after purchase was shocked to see it on the local grocery store shelf haaaa haaaa</li>
    <li> The best out there. No mess, doesn&#x27;t dry easily, and it does what its supposed to do ;)</li>
    <li> We have used a lot of lubes through the years, but Astroglide remains the benchmark in our book.  Remarkably slick, a little goes a long way, persistent, and great with toys.</li>
    <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. Cleans up nicely with water. No residues or greasy feel. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> What can I say? You have to purchase this product by multiples. We now have enough for a zombie apocalypse. Great product when you need a little help.</li>
    <li> You pick the situation, purpose, or reason for using.  It works every time (although sometimes it gets a little &#x27;sticky&#x27;... no pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used it to help remove a ring from my finger when my knuckle swelled up from an injury!  Double-win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  The injury was non-lube related ;)</li>
    <li> I actually prefer the silicone version, but accidentally bought the water based version.  Still the best lubricant we&#x27;ve tried.  Does not get sticky.</li>
    <li> Great product, the name explains it. What else can I say other than great for personal pleasure and bedroom romance. Have fun all!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Scott, Vermont</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Not like anything I have tried before.</li>
    <li> Does this need a review?  You know what it does, you know how it work.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff.</li>
