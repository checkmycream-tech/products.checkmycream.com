### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>excellent article</li>
      <li>Not the best brushes ever, but content with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Great for makeup beginners!</li>
      <li>Flawless application, and the case the brushes come in is awesome too!  </li>
      <li>Is The Best Part.</li>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>great experience</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>Product arrived in immaculate packaging; no shedding of brushes, very smooth, will be very good to start a makeup collection with.</li>
      <li>I was searching for this kind of brush case, and the case is great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for blending but not applying.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>LOVE these brushes!  </li>
      <li>Another AWESOME feature about these is that they are easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Good that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
      <li>But the brush roll (holds brushes) was really nice.</li>
      <li>Of course, I was able to fix this with two applications of Gorilla Glue.</li>
      <li>) it is soooo much better, and softer.</li>
      <li>I love the bag that the brushes came in</li>
      <li>Great gift for my 10 year old daughter who like to play makeup....</li>
      <li>The brushes are great for a beginning makeup wearer and a fairly nice back up brush while washing my higher end brushes.</li>
      <li>There are nice, large, zippered pockets on each side to store your cosmetics when you are traveling.  </li>
      <li>They Feel Cheap.</li>
      <li>I threw away all but three of the brushes, but my brushes fit in the case, plus my mascara.  </li>
      <li>(If you use a fat tube of mascara, it probably won&#x27;t fit.)  </li>
      <li>Not sure how good the quality of the brushes are, but my 16-yr-old niece loved it as part of her b-day gift.</li>
      <li>these are cosmetic brushes, they were new, in perfect shape, enough said.</li>
      <li>, I arrive as expected and good quality, I leave satisfied.</li>
      <li>Other than the fact that the price of this is insanely cheap, the quality is great and you are basically set for life if you buy this</li>
      <li>Overall a good value.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described! ...</li>
      <li>the brushes are worth what they cost.</li>
      <li>Nice low end brushes.</li>
      <li>Just use some soap and the debris comes right off.</li>
      <li>WRONG they do get the job done perfect!</li>
      <li>It looks exactly like the picture shown.</li>
      <li>(first set was for a friend-</li>
      <li>There was a strong smell of fresh paint odor when opening the package, but no big deal</li>
      <li>and I just wish I&#x27;d spent a little more money to buy something good.</li>
      <li>Expect the size of these to be relatively large.</li>
      <li>The case the brushes come in is large and includes two side pockets.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.....</li>
      <li>Brushes Are Very Flimsy.</li>
      <li>Finally I threw it at the trash can in a fit of rage one day and purchased a replacement from Target.</li>
      <li>Really like the smudge tool and the foundation and face brushes though.</li>
      <li>i would recommend these to a person who doesn&#x27;t care about high quality brushes, someone who is basically looking for cheep brushes...</li>
      <li>and I like the brushes except that they lose some strands a little more than I would like</li>
      <li>The brushes are nice in quality, the only complaint I have is that the very first use of the foundation brush (at the lightest of touches) broke.</li>
      <li>If you are an adult who actually wants to apply makeup I would suggest you look elsewhere for brushes.</li>
      <li>It was ok except for the contour brush and all round face brush</li>
      <li>The handles are pretty gross looking too.</li>
      <li>These brushes are really soft.</li>
      <li>I would only recommend purchasing these brushes if they are intended for a child or tween who wants to play with makeup.</li>
      <li>The reason for the 3 stars is that the eye shadow brush is too soft.</li>
      <li>The angel brush is too soft for eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The only reason it cost so much is because they are selling you a case for it.</li>
      <li>arrived early than expected and they are so soft!</li>

<li> but i should have invested into mac brushes &#x3D;/</li>

    <li> Fast shipping.....great experience</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the brushes use them every time she puts on her makeup</li>

(If you use a fat tube of mascara, it probably won&#x27;t fit.)  There are nice, large, zippered pockets on each side to store your cosmetics when you are traveling.  e.l.f. should sell just the case alone.</li>
    <li> It was ok except for the contour brush and all round face brush I didn&#x27;t like that they shedded</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! They came in a big pouch that had two pockets on each side. There were no shedding whatsoever. It looks exactly like the picture shown. I recommend this to everyone especially to those who is only beginning to wear make-up. Starting out with basic brushes is the way to go. There was a strong smell of fresh paint odor when opening the package, but no big deal (:</li>

Finally I threw it at the trash can in a fit of rage one day and purchased a replacement from Target. The rest of the brushes are passable and vary in their quality. I am still using those for the time being, but I haven&#x27;t even had these for a year and I just wish I&#x27;d spent a little more money to buy something good. The handles are pretty gross looking too. Just don&#x27;t bother.</li>

    <li> Honestly this was terrible. The bristles on the brush are so hard on the skin, especially the face ones. And it all goes downhill when you try to wash it. It changes shape and it starts to smell. The only reason it cost so much is because they are selling you a case for it. Don&#x27;t be tricked guys they say that this line of brushes from elf are terrible, get the studio one (the ones with a black funnel) it is soooo much better, and softer.</li>

    <li> LOVE these brushes!  Flawless application, and the case the brushes come in is awesome too!  Bought a 2nd set for myself (first set was for a friend- she loves the set too!)</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft. The reason for the 3 stars is that the eye shadow brush is too soft. It&#x27;s good for blending but not applying. The angel brush is too soft for eyebrows. Really like the smudge tool and the foundation and face brushes though.</li>
