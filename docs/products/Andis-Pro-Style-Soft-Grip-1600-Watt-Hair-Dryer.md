      <li>Great small dryer .</li>
      <li>Used one for several days in a hotel in Canada and liked it so much</li>
      <li>My diffuser fits really well because the barrel is shorter, it helps focus the heat much better than my old one.</li>

      <li>Relatively quiet, soft and pleasant to touch, and very lightweight.</li>
      <li>Not expensive either.</li>
      <li>Like a lot of reviewers said, I first used this hair dryer at a luxury hotel.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like it.  </li>
      <li>I used the dryer without problems until August 2013 when the handle started getting hot while I was drying my hair.</li>
      <li>I have re-ordered this product because it is Light-weight, powerful, reasonably priced and my wife wanted one.</li>
      <li>Funny</li>
      <li>Exactly what we expected and nice size.</li>
      <li>Sort of rubberized handle makes it non-slip, has 2 speeds for both heat and air flow, very lightweight so my arm does not get as tired, not as loud as so many others are, does a great job.</li>
      <li>experienced the same problem as a lot of other people - the on/off switch got lodged in one position and refused to budge.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t always had good luck in the past with hairdryers</li>

      <li>Great little hairdryer - especially for travel.</li>
      <li>I had another, more expensive hair dryer before and this one feels a little cheap, but it&#x27;s probably a great value considering the price.  </li>
      <li>The last time the dryer handle heated up so much you couldn&#x27;t comfortably hold it.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product (&amp; already have)!</li>

      <li>sized).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best suited for shorter hair styles, otherwise it may take longer hair longer to dry due to less air flow and it&#x27;s 1600 wattage (but it&#x27;s still pretty powerful for a medium</li>
      <li>It is more powerful &amp; drys better than other higher watt blow dryers i&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
      <li>I am right handed and use the dryer mostly with my left hand, with a round brush in my right.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this product because of the reputation of Andis products, the appearance, the size and the 1600 watt as I needed a dryer that would not blow fuses in an older home.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very nice, compact, high quality dryer with good controls - a good value.</li>
    <li> A hotel we recently stayed in had this hair dryer and I loved it so much, had to buy one when I got home.&lt;br /&gt;Dries hair quickly and is nice and light too.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this dryer and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want an ionic dryer or a dryer with 1875 watts. The dryer is quiet and does a works well. I find ionic dryers work terrible on fine hair and I hope they bring back the regular dryers soon.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that this blow dryer is this cheap.    I first encountered this blow dryer at a 5-star hotel room and felt in love with it. As soon as I got home, I just had to buy one. I expected the price to be way more than it actually is.    Awesome!!!    Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great little hairdryer!  Nice for traveling, but I use mine everyday.  It dries my hair very fast, and its so lightweight.</li>
    <li> Très satisfait, livraison rapide</li>

    <li> Great small dryer . What I love is that it is light weight, HOT, and small. First used it in a hotel where it was provided and loved it so decided I had to have it. Not expensive either.</li>
    <li> The very first time my wife turned it on, she could not turn the switch off.  She had to unplug it from the wall.  After she unplugged it and tried the switch again, it broke.  When she did have it on, she said it seemed much warmer than usual.  We will be returning and looking for another brand.</li>
    <li> The dryer itself is fine. Relatively quiet, soft and pleasant to touch, and very lightweight. If only it weren&#x27;t defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced the same problem as a lot of other people - the on/off switch got lodged in one position and refused to budge. Also, the handle tends to overheat very quickly.</li>
    <li> Even though this is a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; style pistol hair dryer it&#x27;s not  full sized  (it&#x27;s medium sized).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best suited for shorter hair styles, otherwise it may take longer hair longer to dry due to less air flow and it&#x27;s 1600 wattage (but it&#x27;s still pretty powerful for a medium dryer).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weigh and has a matte finish.</li>
    <li> I used this brand of hairdryer for the first time during a recent hotel stay, and I just loved it.  It&#x27;s light, fast, and easy to use.  The buttons are also conveniently placed so that my hand is not on them as I use the dryer.  I liked the dryer in the hotel so much that I immediately ordered one.  It&#x27;s a super dryer, just about the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I first used one of these dryers in a hotel while on vacation and liked it so well I ordered one on the spot on my laptop. This was December 2012. I used the dryer without problems until August 2013 when the handle started getting hot while I was drying my hair. This continued for about the next eight times I used it. The last time the dryer handle heated up so much you couldn&#x27;t comfortably hold it. I shut it off, and pulled the plug from the outlet. The on/off control had frozen in the off position and the dryer was inoperable. I contacted Andis, and they sent a replacement dryer. I took delivery of the replacement dryer September 15, 2013.I used the replacement dryer about three times and the handle started heating up, same situation as the last one, the on/off switch froze and the dryer was useless. I just sent that dryer back for a replacement. I give the dryer one star, Andis Corporation five stars for customer service. They have a five year warranty on these dryers and they sent the first replacement quickly. They will send a second replacement at no cost to me (the first return cost $10.00 to send the dryer back). Hopefully the second replacement will last a couple of years. I am suspicious though because the same problem developed in the second dryer,  only quicker. My concern is that if one would leave the dryer turned off, but plugged in to the wall outlet, would it overheat on its own and start a fire? Oh, and FYI I don&#x27;t have thick waist length hair. It is shoulder length and average thickness. These dryers were getting light use when they malfunctioned.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of reviewers said, I first used this hair dryer at a luxury hotel. I loved it so much that I immediately ordered one when I got home. This thing packs a punch for how small it is! I have thick wavy hair that is almost to my lower back. It used to take me at least 45 minutes to dry my hair (I use a diffuser) and it was still damp underneath because my dryer sucked my hair up like crazy, it was horrible. It takes maybe 20 now and I can actually dry it all over, even with my head upside down! Hasn&#x27;t sucked my hair into it even once. My diffuser fits really well because the barrel is shorter, it helps focus the heat much better than my old one. It&#x27;s also really lightweight, which is great because of how much hair I have, my arm doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s gonna fall off. I am so happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> I tried this hair dryer in a very upscale marriott hotel and was so impressed I came home and purchased. Lightweight and powerful.</li>
    <li> I originally used this dryer in a hotel when we were visiting Savannah, GA.  I tried to buy it from the hotel but they did not have them for sale.  After my dryer died, I found this on line.  Funny though because there were limited numbers of them out there, which makes me think everyone who has tried one, has been buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I love it but when I turn on the dryer it makes a noise, as if something has broken loose in the dryer and is rattling around.  Always just worries me that one day it&#x27;ll just take a poof and die on me.  The other negative is the air &amp;#34;return&amp;#34; where air is sucked in ... tends to suck my hair in and it tangles in the fan itself.  I am right handed and use the dryer mostly with my left hand, with a round brush in my right.  The issue only happens when I am blowing the right side of my hair ...</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer at a hotel in New York City and liked it so much that I ordered one.  It&#x27;s light and so easy to use.</li>
    <li> If I could, I&#x27;d give it 3.5 stars, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t let you.  I&#x27;m pleased with it so far.  I had another, more expensive hair dryer before and this one feels a little cheap, but it&#x27;s probably a great value considering the price.  There&#x27;s no way to clean the filter, and that may be a feature the way it&#x27;s designed it doesn&#x27;t need one, but we&#x27;ll see.  If I had to buy one again, yes, I&#x27;d probably buy this one, but we&#x27;ll see if I feel the same way a year from now.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is great for the price, very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> its ok... if it got hotter it would be better.</li>
    <li> Best for a guy or girl with short hair.  Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like it.  Very small in size.</li>
    <li> My hairdryer was delivered in early January this year and I LOVED it.  Good heat, lightweight, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Well it is not yet the end of March and the off/on switch has already gone.  Just beware of possible quality issues.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer!  Used one for several days in a hotel in Canada and liked it so much I ordered it when I got home.  Sort of rubberized handle makes it non-slip, has 2 speeds for both heat and air flow, very lightweight so my arm does not get as tired, not as loud as so many others are, does a great job.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a pistol style hair dryer these day. I assume that majority went less bulky shape because it look nicer. My first priority is quiet operations and this pistol shape produce quieter air flows.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair shiny and it&#x27;s so light making it easy to style hair! Great product at a great price!!!   Will even buy another for the teens to use. Would be excellent for travel too. Small and compact.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great seller</li>
    <li> enjoyed this dryer for many cruises and wanted my own, Have not been disappointed!!  Powerful and tiny, delivers as promised</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with products performance.</li>
    <li> I have re-ordered this product because it is Light-weight, powerful, reasonably priced and my wife wanted one. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Got this for more than just drying hair. These are handy for drying winter gloves, boots and hats. I also use this to shrink electrical insulating tubing and window insulator kits. A heat gun gets too hot for other projects and this is about right. Has a nice soft grippy feel in the hand too. Blows allot of aire on high.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does the job.  I wanted a small dryer with multiple heat settings and that is what I got.  I knew it had 1600 Watts when I ordered it, I wish it was a little bit more powerful.  Great for a mans short hair.  For a woman with long thick hair you may want something with more watts.  I have only had the dryer for several weeks.  So far no quality issues.  The guarantee on the box states 5 years.  We will see.  The price is so low for what you get if I get 2 years out of it I will be happy.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice dryer.</li>
    <li> Was recently at a company function in CT and this model was in the bathroom. I loved that it was so light and it had the power for my thick shoulder length hair. Not digital either - my old model would go to zero everytime it was unplugged (a pain). Bought two of these - one for home, one for travel.</li>
    <li> I researched a LOT of hair dryers, wanting one that wasn&#x27;t too noisy and that had BOTH temperature and fan settings-- Found it!! This is the one!! It wasn&#x27;t as expensive as some that just seemed like more than I needed. It does the job I need it to, in a short amount of time, w/o frying my hair!  It&#x27;s not the Large size so it fits easily in my suitcase and travels well. I love the matte finish, which keeps it from sliding off the counter-- just feels solid in my hand without being heavy!</li>
    <li> First discovered this brand of hairdryer at a hotel that my husband and I stayed at and loved so much that when we got home I went online to find one.  It is made very well, a little more expensive than what you would pay for one from walmart but that was okay with me.  I haven&#x27;t always had good luck in the past with hairdryers but I think I&#x27;ll have this Andis for a long time.</li>
    <li> THIS LIGHT WEIGHT HAIR DRYER FITS MY NEED.  SINCE I HAVE A TOUCH OF ARTHRITIS IN MY HANDS IT WORKS GREAT.  EASY TO HOLD AND STORE. SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS ITEM. SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS PRO STYLE DRYER.</li>
    <li> The dryer is quiet and powerful. There are three heat speed settings and one without heat. The dryer has silky-touch surface for smooth handling. We have used Andis hair dryers for years. They are used in upscale hotels.</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer in a nice Hotel in Baltimore and liked it so much we bought one when we got home. After a few weeks of use the dryer would shut down before I was finished drying my hair. We thought it had to be a defect so we wrote the company and they said we could return it for repair. We had to return it at our expense and they sent another dryer.  After only a few weeks of use this dryer is doing the same thing as the first one.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another Andis product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we expected and nice size.</li>
