### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best buy i have had on a product like this shaver</li>
      <li>Fits perfectly, does what it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>All good, but when you say foil and cutter, I expect to receive the cutter as well as the foil.</li>
      <li>Good close shave if you replace every 6 months.</li>
      <li>Product received in good condition and a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>and it fit perfect.</li>
      <li>Amazing just like they reccomend</li>
      <li>I have used Braun razors for probably 18 to 20 years and love the razors.</li>
      <li>So when ordering a replacement head make sure it&#x27;s for your shaver).</li>
      <li>need to change more.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and gives me a nice shave.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was some kind of irritation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and a half, and it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Shaver does not work any better than then the 6 yr old foil did - except - pinch more!</li>
      <li>Glad to have another new blade.</li>
      <li>One thing I have discovered in all this is that when I installed the new Foil and Cutter head, for the first several shaves when I would brush out the shaver head, the residue would be mostly metal shavings from the cutter head and or the foil.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I replaced the cutter cassette, the razor cut as if it was a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent over rating.</li>
      <li>after I checked my current razor it was clear that it was the right one.  </li>
      <li>At first I did not think it had both the foil and cutter since I have had several Braun razors some in which the foil was separate from the cutter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so I can&#x27;t speak for those who need a lawn mower to get a clean shave.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a regular normal beard.</li>
      <li>Since there is no other manufacturer of these foils and cutters, Braun has us all in a locked cage and knows it.</li>
      <li>Big difference over the old one.</li>
      <li>My personal feelings on Braun shaver foils and cutters is that they have fallen far short of the quality that they once produced.</li>
      <li>There is no way these new heads will last that long (unless you only shave once a month)!</li>

<li> (FYI, hard to tell from pictures - they all look alike to me.</li>
<li> As promised just slow delivery.</li>
<li> Quality of this is not good at all.</li>
<li> Once I inspected the cutting head I noticed the broken foil.</li>
<li> Braun recommends that you change foils and cutter heads approximately every 18 months!</li>

    <li> I have used this product for about 3 weeks. Out of nowhere the foil part just broke split apart leaving a jagged edge on it. I didn&#x27;t notice and shaved with. After some I felt my face irritated and burning and itching my wife noticed that I had cuts and scratches all over my face. At first I thought it was some kind of irritation. The next day, without inspecting the shaver, I shaved again and immediately my face started to burn. Once I inspected the cutting head I noticed the broken foil. Quality of this is not good at all. Stay away from it.</li>
    <li> Gave me 12 months of service.</li>
    <li> Product received in good condition and a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;When I replaced the cutter cassette, the razor cut as if it was a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent over rating.</li>
    <li> All good, but when you say foil and cutter, I expect to receive the cutter as well as the foil. All I received was the foil.</li>
    <li> At first I did not think it had both the foil and cutter since I have had several Braun razors some in which the foil was separate from the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;So after I checked my current razor it was clear that it was the right one.  Only time will tell if it last 18 months.</li>
    <li> I will order one again when needed. Great price and it fit perfect. Best buy i have had on a product like this shaver</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly, does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> My personal feelings on Braun shaver foils and cutters is that they have fallen far short of the quality that they once produced. I have purchased several heads in the last couple of years that only last from two to maybe three months. Braun recommends that you change foils and cutter heads approximately every 18 months! There is no way these new heads will last that long (unless you only shave once a month)! My beard is not a thick heavy duty beard it&#x27;s just a regular normal beard. I have used Braun razors for probably 18 to 20 years and love the razors. I&#x27;ve worn out two or three and I now have two, a series 5 and a series 3. I thought there was something wrong with the series 3 because it took 30 to 45 minutes to shave and even though I would put a new head on it (at roughly $25.00 plus shipping) it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. So I purchased a series 5.....same thing! One thing I have discovered in all this is that when I installed the new Foil and Cutter head, for the first several shaves when I would brush out the shaver head, the residue would be mostly metal shavings from the cutter head and or the foil. To me that means that the engineering is not precise enough and is allowing the cutter to interact with the foil an thus dull the blades and therefore not last as long as they should. Since there is no other manufacturer of these foils and cutters, Braun has us all in a locked cage and knows it. Well, that&#x27;s my feelings. I wish I had the confidence to try another brand!!!!</li>
    <li> Shaver does not work any better than then the 6 yr old foil did - except - pinch more!</li>
    <li> Reasonable price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and a half, and it&#x27;s perfect for me. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so I can&#x27;t speak for those who need a lawn mower to get a clean shave.

    <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric shaver for 3 years and works well with the cleaner. Glad to have another new blade.</li>
    <li> Good close shave if you replace every 6 months. Amazing just like they reccomend</li>
    <li> Big difference over the old one. need to change more.</li>
    <li> Ordered Series 3 foil &amp; cutter cassette replacement. Arrived without damage and are performing satisfactorily.</li>
    <li> The only complaint is that it took around three weeks to get it.</li>
    <li> As promised just slow delivery.</li>
    <li> This was just a replacement.</li>
    <li> It is what it is and was delivered as expected.</li>
