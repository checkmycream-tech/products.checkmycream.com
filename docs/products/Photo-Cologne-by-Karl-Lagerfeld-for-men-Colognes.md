      <li>The sprayer works fine.  </li>
      <li>The packaging looked absolutely genuine and the bottles as well.  </li>
      <li>This is somewhat close to the original scent</li>
      <li>Clean ,Fresh!</li>
      <li>Plus, everyone always compliments how &#x27;clean&#x27;</li>
      <li>Buy it someplace else if you want the true Photo scent.    </li>
      <li>it someplace else if you want the true Photo</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also uncommon to find any other guy that uses it, so it became my trademark.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still good, but I&#x27;d prefer something a little bit more</li>
      <li>Fresh clean smell.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;to be super close.</li>
      <li>it was based on true fresh Photo spray, I would rate it a five.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells very close but does not have the staying power of the original.</li>
      <li>I just love everything about this fantastic scent, it lingers on my skin all day long!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lagerfeld Photo is an amazing scent that smells fantastic on men.&lt;br /&gt;We used to purchase ours at Dillards, but no longer live near a mall.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle I received (and apparently others as well) purchased from THIS listing</li>
      <li>Nice smell, but not very distinctive.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and it seems to last all day.</li>
      <li>Looking for some chaps next. :)</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband because it was one of my favorite male calognes from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Its amazing and compliments after an other keep coming when I use this product.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m definitely coming back to purchase more!</li>
      <li>What a shame that the company decided to mess with such a FORMERLY great product.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>it was the real thing and cheaper than the stores have it.</li>
      <li>Which brings us to the bottom line: it is now much cheaper than before.</li>
      <li>But the scent of the cologne was very faded.  </li>
      <li>Everyone comments on how much they like the fragrance</li>
      <li>a shame that the company decided to mess with such a FORMERLY great product.what is being sold in THIS particular listing   is either tampered with or older than dirt itself.   </li>
      <li>regular Photo is fantastic, but what is being sold in THIS particular listing</li>
      <li>I still had some left of the original</li>
      <li>I do recall that the lid on the original had a knurled look reminiscent of a camera body.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to other people about this cologne.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how strong the odor is though as compared to my previous purchasing this cologne from a store.  </li>
      <li>either tampered with or older than dirt itself.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
      <li>The real thing can be smelled very clearly and you don&#x27;t have</li>
      <li>She had me try some high dollar stuff</li>
      <li>Put differently, it is permissible to ship hazardous materials to customers but not the other way around.</li>
      <li>nice mix of spice and wood scent, at least to me.</li>
      <li>shipment was quick, and it LOOKS like a new, sealed bottle, but when sprayed,&lt;br /&gt;you about have to stick a nostril directly on it to smell anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY not like regular Photo!!  </li>
      <li>But, know that with this purchase, you will get the new version,</li>

      <li>Time to look for a new fragrance for my husband.    </li>
      <li>It may be that these bottles are from a very old production year.  </li>
      <li>Scent did not last long and smelt nothing like the original.</li>
      <li>used a long time ago brings back memories of family and pets all of who I miss very much!</li>
      <li>Smells like a few other colognes I got for my hubby; but still smelled nice.</li>
      <li>The scent profile is more or less the same, but I believe the makers decided to forgo the more expensive ingredients to make for a cheaper cologne.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whatever is going on with it, it barely smells like Photo at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is barely any scent in the bottle</li>
      <li>and I should say the other ones I had were not only strong but lasted for a whole day at least.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know if what is being sent out on this listing is older than dirt and therefore&lt;br /&gt;weak, or it has somehow been watered down or forged and resealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is not the cheap stuff either</li>
<li> You now need to use quite a few whiffs for the smell to stay with you through the day (the old Photo only required a few drops).</li>
<li> But, know that with this purchase, you will get the new version, which   is a weak watered-down substitute of the old one in the black box.   </li>
<li> It lasted few minutes only.  </li>
<li> (Between you and me, I got it for about 1/3 the price here on Amazon over any other shops...)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, I love the way this cologne smells.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what to write in the review here, because I believe this is where you review the product,&lt;br /&gt;not the seller. But I cannot help but bring this matter up in here, to perhaps keep someone else from&lt;br /&gt;being ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband smells wonderful in Photo.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a while since we bought any, because it is fairly expensive and we&#x27;ve been through a rough patch.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d celebrate a change in the situation with a bottle of his favorite cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is barely any scent in the bottle we received.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if what is being sent out on this listing is older than dirt and therefore&lt;br /&gt;weak, or it has somehow been watered down or forged and resealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever is going on with it, it barely smells like Photo at all.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it was indeed a deal too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was quick, and it LOOKS like a new, sealed bottle, but when sprayed,&lt;br /&gt;you about have to stick a nostril directly on it to smell anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY not like regular Photo!!  The real thing can be smelled very clearly and you don&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;to be super close. Even after a direct spray and sniff, almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Something is very wrong here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lagerfeld Photo is an amazing scent that smells fantastic on men.&lt;br /&gt;We used to purchase ours at Dillards, but no longer live near a mall.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle I received (and apparently others as well) purchased from THIS listing&lt;br /&gt;barely resembles the Photo scent. If I was blindfolded and asked to identify the scent,&lt;br /&gt;I would wonder if someone was kidding with me - yes, it is that weak.&lt;br /&gt;On my rating - if it was based on this purchase alone, I would rate it one star.&lt;br /&gt;(Actually, less than one, but you can&#x27;t do half-stars.)&lt;br /&gt;If it was based on true fresh Photo spray, I would rate it a five.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I went with a two, because this is not a fresh product,&lt;br /&gt;and I feel a bit ripped off. It can&#x27;t be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE FOREWARNED:&lt;br /&gt;The regular Photo is fantastic, but what is being sold in THIS particular listing&lt;br /&gt;is either tampered with or older than dirt itself.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it someplace else if you want the true Photo scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JULY 2011:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other places that Lagerfeld has changed the formulation on this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Why, I do not know. But, know that with this purchase, you will get the new version, which&lt;br /&gt;is a weak watered-down substitute of the old one in the black box.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy it again.

    <li> Nice smell, but not very distinctive.  Smells like a few other colognes I got for my hubby; but still smelled nice.</li>
    <li> I use this once in a while, the wife likes it so what the heck. She had me try some high dollar stuff and I found it didn&#x27;t mix well with sweat. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is not the cheap stuff either but it will not break the bank. (Between you and me, I got it for about 1/3 the price here on Amazon over any other shops...) Go ahead, try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice mix of spice and wood scent, at least to me. I&#x27;m told it is an informal/casual sent, whatever that means...</li>
    <li> one of the packages rattled when it was delivered as it is a Christmas gift I have not opened the packaging.</li>
    <li> used a long time ago brings back memories of family and pets all of who I miss very much!</li>
    <li> Be cautious. I bought this cologne - which is sold and shipped by Amazon - and if it is not a counterfeit (I trust Amazon), it is expired. Its scent is weak and fades quickly. I am used to Lagerfeld&#x27;s Photo and I should say the other ones I had were not only strong but lasted for a whole day at least. I bought four of them, and I wanted to return the three unopened ones. This is what Amazon tells me:    \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.\\&quot;    Put differently, it is permissible to ship hazardous materials to customers but not the other way around. This is odd, to say the least.</li>
    <li> I use this product as it should be used. So if you do not know how to use it donot invest your money as you need to seek advice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to other people about this cologne. Its amazing and compliments after an other keep coming when I use this product. And I&#x27;m definitely coming back to purchase more! Fast delivery and the greatest shopping experience ever! See you soon!</li>
    <li> Love them smell. Hard item to find in the store. Always find a good price with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I cannot begin to tell you how many years this has been my favorite.  Manly, yet not over powering.  Use just a touch of spray and watch how many compliments you get through the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Photo since 1991.  There&#x27;s not a scent that gets my wife worked up more this.  Plus, everyone always compliments how &#x27;clean&#x27; I smell when wearing it.</li>
    <li> I use it, sparsely, as an after-shave.  Does an excellent job. A trace of the smell, just a trace, lingers for hours.  From time to time strangers (usually women), like in an elevator, will  ask me for the name of the source of that smell.</li>
    <li> is of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;m very pleased with the perfume. I hope to buy the coming year</li>
    <li> There is something definitely wrong with this product. Scent did not last long and smelt nothing like the original. I do recall that the lid on the original had a knurled look reminiscent of a camera body. This one does not. Caveat Emptor.</li>
    <li> Great price with a fast arrival time!</li>
    <li> Photo by Karl Lagerfeld and Kouros by YSL are the best EDT I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Fast shipping. Recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fragrance smells great on my husband.</li>
    <li> My husband has been looking for some photo cologne but this toilette works just as good. Looking for some chaps next. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because it was one of my favorite male calognes from the 90&#x27;s. I still had some left of the original so I could give it a comparison. This is not the same. It smells very close but does not have the staying power of the original. But because of the price it still was an OK purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this item for the past 20 years after reading about it in Playboy Magazine. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this cologne.  It is a great price for the size bottle and it is not always easily accessible to find in stores.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how strong the odor is though as compared to my previous purchasing this cologne from a store.  I don&#x27;t smell it as much, but have been told I smell good so others must be able to smell it.  All and all I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Of all the toilette I used, Photo by Lagerfeld is the only one I WOULD and STILL get compliments</li>
    <li> People who are saying this is a counterfeit or expired: it&#x27;s not. In the 1990s this cologne was indeed different. And yes, I can say this because I have a really old bottle of it with a tiny little bit left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a number of years ago, they changed the cologne to what it is now.  It&#x27;s no longer as... overpowering as it was before. You now need to use quite a few whiffs for the smell to stay with you through the day (the old Photo only required a few drops). The scent profile is more or less the same, but I believe the makers decided to forgo the more expensive ingredients to make for a cheaper cologne. Which brings us to the bottom line: it is now much cheaper than before. In the end, I think it was a good trade-off, so I can now wear Photo as my daily cologne without feeling I&#x27;m wearing an overpowering scent. It&#x27;s also uncommon to find any other guy that uses it, so it became my trademark.</li>
    <li> I really think this is a great Cologne for men. I use it on a regular basis and love it!!!</li>
    <li> el perfume muy bueno el costo muy económico lo recomiendo [[ASIN:B001CT09B8 Karl Lagerfeld Photo By Karl Lagerfeld For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2-Ounces]]</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend as a gift! They were thrilled with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this.  It hasn&#x27;t made me into a girl magnet yet, but I think that I smell better with it rather then what I smelled like without it, and no one has run away from me gagging yet!  I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.  The sprayer works fine.  What else do you want to know?</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I always get tons of compliments whenever I wear it!</li>
    <li> The Cologne is great, been using it since its introduction in the 1990&#x27;s..........the shipping was great too....arrived on time as promised ...thumbs up</li>
    <li> I just love everything about this fantastic scent, it lingers on my skin all day long! It smells clean, intense and in my opinion very erotic! I get compliments of how nice I smell everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> I bought it because someone recommended that to me, but I have never tried. It&#x27;s still good, but I&#x27;d prefer something a little bit more Sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Every opinion is relative.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles and they were received promptly.  The packaging looked absolutely genuine and the bottles as well.  I have used Photo for the last ten years.  But the scent of the cologne was very faded.  It lasted few minutes only.  It may be that these bottles are from a very old production year.  They cannot be returned but I was disappointed.  The rating is for the bottle not for the seller.  But by this time, from this review and others, the seller should know that there is a problem with the product.</li>
    <li> Is the best for me!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is somewhat close to the original scent but it&#x27;s not as subtle or distinct.  It does last fairly long.</li>
    <li> I recommended for every day use. Clean ,Fresh! You will turn heads. Compared with other cologne I use  it is affordable and a great product !</li>
    <li> It is the only fragrance my husband likes.Everyone comments on how much they like the fragrance</li>
    <li> it was the real thing and cheaper than the stores have it. i would recommend it to all who need cologne</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years! It&#x27;s one of the few constants in my life and I intend to keep it in my en suite for years to come.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Photo and so do I - he smells good always.  A little and the scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Fresh clean smell. Not over powering</li>
    <li> I have bought this for my husband in the past. When he ran out of his cologne, he gave me this bottle as a \\&quot;reminder\\&quot; of what to get when searching. I love the smell and it seems to last all day. Shipping was quick.</li>
