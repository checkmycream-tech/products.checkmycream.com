      <li>I got mine free as a birthday thing from Sephora, and now I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br</li>
      <li>-I would go with the cheap blister moisture melt instead, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
      <li>A pure delight ! :)</li>
      <li>you are lipstick wearer, the Fresh Sugar Rose (a slightly tinted version of Sugar) might be a great alternative to lip gloss or balm.</li>
      <li>this size (which is perfect for pockets &amp; small purses) seems pretty good for $9.50.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t checked the shipping, which can really kick up the price</li>
      <li>I have tried many other brands but this is by far the best.</li>

      <li>Well, as it turns out, I absolutely fell in love with Fresh Sugar and now I can&#x27;t live without</li>
      <li>A few years ago, I received a sample of a duo of Fresh Sugar lip products with a Sephora order - Fresh Sugar and Fresh Sugar Rose.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with them, so I do use them on occasion, but I had no idea just how tiny this size is.</li>
      <li>I would just recommend that everyone check the ingredients first to see if there is anything you are allergic to.</li>
      <li>First time in a long time that I have been able to wear lipstick.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this lip balm goes on and stays on, it is lightweight, smooth and long lasting.</li>
      <li>REALLY well....</li>
      <li>and it has really helped.  </li>

      <li>When you wait too long and your lips become cracked, this quickly helps calm the irritation and help the lips begin to heal.</li>
      <li>Definitely would just spend a couple more dollars and get the regular sized one</li>
      <li>I recommend the EGGS, particularly the mint one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never heard of the brand before, and they were so cute in their little metal tubes.</li>
      <li>There are some outstanding lip balms for far less money.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and smooth, but size was smaller than i expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive but worth every penny!</li>

<li> I always have dry lips.  </li>
<li> The taste is hideous and I do not think it helps with dry lips</li>
<li> no one ever heard of bubble envelopes seriously?), but as I product I highly recommend</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t get crushed or mashed in your purse.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had problems with other lip balms stinging when I put them on.  </li>
<li> Very small expected a little larger size even though they call it &amp;#34;half size&amp;#34;!</li>
<li> so I feel I have to push down and smear it around a lot to get a coat on evenly.&lt;br</li>
<li> Also, it&#x27;s half the size I was expecting.</li>
<li> Black market product.</li>

    <li> This is the best lip moisturizer I have used. Living in MT, I have tried many. I even had to buy one for my BFF to experience. She loves it too! Plus it has SPF!</li>
    <li> great product, works very well.</li>
    <li> I love Fresh lippies! Especially this one. It has this lemony scent. Makes me lips taste awesome. Its very hydrating for my lips too.</li>
    <li> I always have dry lips.  I use this I night before I go to bed and it has really helped.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and smooth, but size was smaller than i expected. Definitely would just spend a couple more dollars and get the regular sized one</li>
    <li> I have used this lip moisturizer for a few years now. I must say that it is the BEST so far ! It hydrates my lips a lot. Plus, it tastes like lemon pie. A pure delight ! :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite.  Plenty of moisture!  Nothing compares.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm out there.</li>
    <li> My lips get dry, miserable, sore and sensitive in the winter.  I&#x27;ve had problems with other lip balms stinging when I put them on.  This balm is an absolute delight.  It goes on so soft and smooth, and has a light citrus scent.  It keeps my lips soft and protected for hours.  The tube itself is substantial.  It won&#x27;t get crushed or mashed in your purse.  Yes, this is absolutely pricey, but it&#x27;s also wonderful.  It leaves budget lip balms in the dust.</li>
    <li> This lip balm smells WONDERFUL!  It goes on smoothly and moisturizes really well.  Also, Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment has an SPF 15 to protect lips from harmful rays from the sun.  Those are the pluses.  There are quite a few other lip balms on the market that more or less do the same thing for a lot less than $15.00!</li>
    <li> Very small expected a little larger size even though they call it &amp;#34;half size&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s expensive compared to other over the counter moisturizers but this one works. I&#x27;m buying the larger tube next time!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip treatment. Silky feel and not sticky. I have tried many other brands but this is by far the best. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Black market product. Came with &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34; inked out. Also, it&#x27;s half the size I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It more than exceeded my expectations. Leaves my lips feeling smooth and lasts through multiple cups of coffee. It&#x27;s become my new favorite lip balm</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. A little pricey for how small it is but nice to have an option of buying it without spending $25+ for a full-size!</li>
    <li> Great pocket size lip gloss with SPF...nice light fragrance and flavor.</li>
    <li> All the product quality&#x27;s  are superb.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t know about weight and it&#x27;s quite pricey for the size!!&lt;br /&gt;So I could pick it up at sephora at the same price!!!  Dissapointment!&lt;br /&gt;The product however is very good but no need to order it online!</li>
    <li> This is the best for creamy moist lips. I also found the tinted Fresh Sugar which is what I will use instead of lipstick.</li>
    <li> This is perfect purse size so you can have your lips handled when needed. I have tried a lot of lip moisturizers and this is the best. I have not checked the ingredients but hoping that there are no dangerous chemicals</li>

    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this lip balm goes on and stays on, it is lightweight, smooth and long lasting. This is a must have product for anyone who suffers from dry lips and wants true relief.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I&#x27;d buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was a tiny product. Love Sugar, but this was not a good deal. Check the oz.</li>
    <li> This product does make your lips smooth without being greasy and you don&#x27;t have to keep re applying. I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This gloss has some kind of magic property.  Even though it is colorless, it somehow creates a beautiful rich sheen that is as good as lipstick!  Moisturizing and not sticky.</li>
    <li> Slides on the lips very smoothly. A little goes a long way. A subtle but very pleasant scent. Long lasting and really helps keep the lips soft. When you wait too long and your lips become cracked, this quickly helps calm the irritation and help the lips begin to heal. The cost is worth it. Lasted the entire Minnesota winter with once daily use.</li>
    <li> Expensive but it def made my lips feel so nice. I wouldnt get it again bc i dont want to crave this feeling and the price if you know what i mean....... this was only a travel size and it was $10! ; /</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It is really amazing. I wish that it was cheaper, but it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who put this lip treatment on and got a weird burning sensation and weird taste in the back of my throat? No, I was not sick. It was always with ONLY this lip treatment.&lt;br /&gt;It sounds insane to describe it now, because this lip treatment is the one thing on the planet that has ever caused that to happen for me, but there was something in the formula that I must have been sensitive to. I remember dreading using this balm, because I knew the back of my throat would burn from the smell, or the chemical, or whatever caused the sensation, but I continued to use it because I knew that it moisturized my lips REALLY well....and the little fact that it&#x27;s expensive, and I would be crying all the way to the garbage can if I threw this away.&lt;br /&gt;I always used this as my go-to moisturizer every time I exfoliated my lips with a scrub, because I knew it would do the best job out of all the lip balms I owned. If it wasn&#x27;t for the horrible back-of-throat thing, I would give this 5 stars. I would just recommend that everyone check the ingredients first to see if there is anything you are allergic to.</li>
    <li> The taste is hideous and I do not think it helps with dry lips-I would go with the cheap blister moisture melt instead, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> First time in a long time that I have been able to wear lipstick. Don&#x27;t like the price and hope it doesn&#x27;t break</li>
    <li> Is it $20 lip? I&#x27;m not feeling it. There are some outstanding lip balms for far less money. I have real allergies with lip balm. I recommend the EGGS, particularly the mint one.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I received a sample of a duo of Fresh Sugar lip products with a Sephora order - Fresh Sugar and Fresh Sugar Rose. I&#x27;d never heard of the brand before, and they were so cute in their little metal tubes. Well, as it turns out, I absolutely fell in love with Fresh Sugar and now I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is costly, but my lips never feel better than they do after using this. It has a light citrus/lemony scent which I find extremely pleasant. It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t get tacky, and is perfect for ladies who don&#x27;t wear lipstick often. I usually put it on at night and when I wake up in the morning, I can still feel it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are lipstick wearer, the Fresh Sugar Rose (a slightly tinted version of Sugar) might be a great alternative to lip gloss or balm. It isn&#x27;t super glamorous or shiny, but your lips will be healthy. And for me, that is really all I care about.</li>
    <li> Adorable and works great, but these balms are SO overpriced. I fell in love with them, so I do use them on occasion, but I had no idea just how tiny this size is.</li>
    <li> As anyone who knows me can attest, I am an admitted lip balm,gloss,stick addict.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift for me, as I am never more than a few feet from one wherever I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I signed up for the ClubSephora (?) and was given this balm for free.&lt;br /&gt;Oh. My.  It is lovely.  Sooo incredibly smoothe; it goes on like a luxe dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am a sucker for fragrance / tastes, &amp; this is lightly orange scented.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is powder-coated metal so it&#x27;s just as silky as its contents &amp; twists up, so there&#x27;s less chance of smooshing it in the cap, or losing the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have decided I need this balm as a staple in my life &amp; found out the regular size is- wait for it-&lt;br /&gt;$22.50.  Y E O W C H!  .. So without doing the price-per-gram comparison,&lt;br /&gt; this size (which is perfect for pockets &amp; small purses) seems pretty good for $9.50.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t checked the shipping, which can really kick up the price&lt;br /&gt;(has no one ever heard of bubble envelopes seriously?), but as I product I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;  Just when you get hooked on it &amp; want its mommy, remember there&#x27;s always Christmas &amp; your birthday.&lt;br /&gt;;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: Purse-slappin&#x27; but Lip-Smackin&#x27; Goodness! &#x3D;9&#x27;</li>
    <li> This lip balm is seriously amazing.  I got mine free as a birthday thing from Sephora, and now I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smooth and stays on your lips without the need to reapply it every 10 minutes.  It is a tad expensive, but I promise you, you will love it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;d order again.</li>
    <li> I love this lip stuff it keeps my lips soft and moist.</li>
    <li> I personally really don&#x27;t like this lip balm. I have it from Sephora and am amazed at how much it cost. I don&#x27;t like it because:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lipstick itself is constructed as a very small cylinder. It covers little of my mouth at any time so I feel I have to push down and smear it around a lot to get a coat on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;2. The lip cream feels very thick and gooey. After I roll the stick over my lips a bunch of times, I feel like I have a thick layer of wax on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy Nivea or Lypsyl any day over this.</li>
    <li> Love it..Makes my lips so soft.</li>
