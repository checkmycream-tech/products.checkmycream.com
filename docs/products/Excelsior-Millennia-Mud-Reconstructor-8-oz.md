      <li>cheap drugstore conditioners have worked better.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s still the same great product I was introduced to many years ago.</li>
      <li>, I was impressed and found it for half of what she paid, wherever she got hers.</li>
      <li>This one is more liquid and emollient than the older formula that was more semisolid and had more &amp;#34;mudd&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>When my local beauty supply store didn&#x27;t have it in stock anymore, I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is a great deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>All I know is that my hair was damaged to the point of falling out and this product really made my hair feel nice.</li>
      <li>No longer available in my area.</li>
      <li>Used to work great to restore and deep condition my hair.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down and gives super fine hair wonderful body.</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant smell and is easy to rinse out after leaving it on your hair for a few minutes in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this on Sallys.com.</li>
      <li>I hope you keep selling it because it gives rich treatment for hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, permed and colored hair and live in a dry climate, so this product is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>It came very promptly and the size of the tube was a good large 8 oz.  </li>
      <li>It works so well for dry hair, and it smells great.</li>
      <li>I love it though, keeps your hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Does anyone know if this is true?</li>
      <li>I admit I did pay more to ship it than the product costs, but I like it so much that I was willing to do it anyway.  </li>
      <li>This is the same product I have been using for years, and I love it!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it is very hard to find, so I am happy to have been able to order it.</li>
      <li>I was quite surprised at how much more it cost than when I bought it at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I continue to use it every day and it keeps the hair healthy, soft but manageable.  </li>
      <li>The results are worth it.</li>
      <li>After using this, even a comb slides right through.</li>
      <li>I notice a difference right away.</li>
      <li>It is far more effective than more expensive brands-I noticed a huge difference in the condition of my hair after just one use!</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for making it available.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair and most conditioners just flatten it down.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t seem to get the same wonderful results I have gotten in the past.</li>
      <li>I would first strip the chemical off wiNeutrogena, then leave the mud over night.</li>
      <li>It conditions my hair, makes it soft, shiny and feel really clean.  </li>
      <li>it makes my hair feel full and soft.  </li>
      <li>use it in place of conditioner and it gives my hair more body and makes it easier to blow dry.</li>
      <li>Looks and feels the same, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same amazing properties it had when I was purchasing it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies.</li>
      <li>It does not, however, moisturize as much as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I really like the way my hair is after I use it</li>
      <li>This is a hair treatment that gives you a very noticable boost in thickness and shine.</li>
      <li>I like it that much.</li>
      <li>In fact, he is very well known in our area</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seller was very prompt in product delivery.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything to my hair..</li>
      <li>Now it is just too softening, just like so many other hair conditioners.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have hair that isnt super thin, but is somewhat medium thin. This softens my hair!! I will buy more of this when I need some more. I happen to use this product when my sister had it, I was impressed and found it for half of what she paid, wherever she got hers. Hopefully this product will work for your hair, but everyone is different.</li>
    <li> I originally found this product a few years ago but they stopped selling it in BC...when I found it online I was thrilled!!</li>
    <li> I have used Millennia Mud for about 30 years.  The best results I ever had were when I lost all my hair due to cancer and continued to use it on my bald head.  When my hair eventually grew back it was fuller and healthier than ever before.  I continue to use it every day and it keeps the hair healthy, soft but manageable.  I LOVE IT and couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff to help ones hair in need for repair and treatment Deff a must buy for over processed hair to help reconstruct and restore</li>
    <li> I had been using this product years ago and then could not find it anywhere.  One day I was sitting at my computer and thought I would check Amazon since they have everything !  Up it pops.  I admit I did pay more to ship it than the product costs, but I like it so much that I was willing to do it anyway.  It came very promptly and the size of the tube was a good large 8 oz.  I have fine, permed and colored hair and live in a dry climate, so this product is perfect for me.  It has a very pleasant smell and is easy to rinse out after leaving it on your hair for a few minutes in the shower.  I would reorder again even paying more to ship it than to purchase it.  I like it that much.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have used it for years.  Wish I could find it on the shelves.  Doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down and gives super fine hair wonderful body.</li>
    <li> I have used millennia mud for 15 years. It is the only conditioner that does not weigh down my fine, limp hair. It adds nice body and fullness. Sometimes I use it as a deep conditioning treatment by applying to wet hair prior to shampoo. I then rinse, shampoo twice, rinse, apply mud to the ends only,followed by a final rinse. It sounds like a lot of work, but my hair needs all the help it can get. And it is really no more work than a hot oil treatment.  The results are worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great deep conditioner. I notice a difference right away. Not tested on animals, and doesn&#x27;t stink. For a deep deep condition sleep with it on. I have been using this for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED  THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 25 YEARS.  I LOVE USING THIS FOR MY HAIR.  IF I CAN&#x27;T FIND IT LOCALLY I GO ON LINE TO FIND IT.  I NEVER WANT TO RUN OUT OF MILLENNIA MUD</li>
    <li> Perhaps this takes longer to work for some hair types because I have used it twice now and, so far, there is no difference. Not thrilled with the smell either but that is fine, I have smelled worse things in my life. I will use it again and if things change, I will certainly come back and change my rating.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, gray/silver hair that has been damaged over the years due to my going gray as a teen and having to dye it for 40+ years. We never think about what we are doing to our hair until the damage is done I guess. Now I just want it healthy because I have grown into my hair so to speak.</li>
    <li> This product is great for making my hair manageable after washing.  If I don&#x27;t use this, my hair is stiff and tangled, can&#x27;t even run my fingers through it in the shower.  After using this, even a comb slides right through.</li>
    <li> I love Millennia Mud, I&#x27;ve used it for years. It works so well for dry hair, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Excelsior Millennia Mud is a product that I always turn to when my hair is stress out and unmanagable. This is a hair treatment that gives you a very noticable boost in thickness and shine. I have had a hard time finding this product in stores lately so, it is great to find it now on Amazon. If you haven&#x27;t tried it please do and you will be pleasantly surprized!</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like anymore is that it does not come i in a bottle</li>
    <li> This is an above average hair conditioner. It does seem to give my hair more body. It does not, however, moisturize as much as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> This is the same product I have been using for years, and I love it! Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> love and wish I could find more</li>
    <li> This is the best mud for my hair.  I was very happy to find it here because I couldn&#x27;t even buy it from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Millennia Mud about 16 years ago after a bad perm. I immediately fell in love! Its thick consistency was easy to get through my long, coarse hair, and it was soft and manageable afterwards. I bought it at Sally Beauty a few times after that, but had not used it for a while. I have been highlighting my hair regularly for the past few years, and now my ends are in bad shape and I have a lot of breakage. I went to Sally to get my miracle Millennia Mud, but alas, they do not sell it anymore! I went online to find it and got it in the mail two days ago. It&#x27;s still the same great product I was introduced to many years ago. I am already seeing a decrease in breakage, and my hair is softer and my damaged ends seem less noticeable. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this on Sallys.com. For some reason they no longer sell it.  But I can&#x27;t tell you enough how my hair feels after an application!  Soft! Plus my 4A-C hair pops with curls! I&#x27;m actually addicted to this product! This has become my staple reconstructor.</li>
    <li> Was so upset when I found that Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply didn&#x27;t carry this anymore.  Found it on Amazon and was delighted.  This is the best stuff I have ever used.  Makes my dry grey hair shine and looks so healthy.  Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product several years ago.  I couldn&#x27;t find anymore when I wanted it and then forgot about it.  As I was spring cleaning I found an old tube of the Millennia Mud and decided to check on Amazon to see if I could find some again.  I was ecstatic and ordered this tube immediately.  Excelsior Millennia Mud Reconstructor is one of the best I have ever used.  It conditions my hair, makes it soft, shiny and feel really clean.  No residue and it does not weigh down your hair.  Amazing product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have anything as far as the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula goes to compare this too. All I know is that my hair was damaged to the point of falling out and this product really made my hair feel nice. I slept in it a few nights. I have babied my hair and it is trying to turn a corner (I also cut it quite a bit). I would def. purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Used to work great to restore and deep condition my hair. I have been very ill, so it&#x27;s hard to tell the results yet. I would first strip the chemical off wiNeutrogena, then leave the mud over night. The result was like having a beautiful new head of hair.,just have have to wait until I can get out and get the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. It didn&#x27;t really do anything to my hair.. cheap drugstore conditioners have worked better. If you need a real good conditioner for damaged hair, I&#x27;d recommend Neutrogena triple moisture deep recovery hair mask [[ASIN:B004AI8OTC Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask]]</li>
    <li> I can see no way to improve it. I get great results. I would like to buy this product in a container with more ounces.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t seem the same as when I bought it at Sally Beauty.  Someone told me that the store where they used to buy it told them the company was sold and the formula was changed.  Does anyone know if this is true? I don&#x27;t seem to get the same wonderful results I have gotten in the past.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 6 years. I have baby fine hair and most conditioners just flatten it down. Millenia Mud thickens my hair and gives it amazing body and shine. I color my hair and it keeps the hair cuticle healthy and smooth..none of that dry, straw texture of regularly colored hair. I would recommend it to anyone! When my local beauty supply store didn&#x27;t have it in stock anymore, I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have been  using it for years.  Love it. It makes my hair feel great and completely does away with split ends.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that is hard to curl with a perm. I asked my hairdresser to rub some mud on his hands and apply to the ends of my air before rolling the perm. It turned out beautifully. In fact, he is very well known in our area and he asked me to bring him some of the mud.  That is why I purchased more. I did not find it at the beauthy supply store for him. Please keep this product available!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and Sally&#x27;s, the beauty supply store has dicontinued carrying it.  Thiswas only place to find it until I checked here.  Thanks so much for making it available.  I ordered 2 tubes that will probably last me over a year. I hope I will still be able to find after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was very prompt in product delivery.</li>
    <li> I was quite surprised at how much more it cost than when I bought it at Sally&#x27;s. I really like the way my hair is after I use it so I  paid twice the price for it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  it makes my hair feel full and soft.  Using it once a week is definitely great!</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner after swimming in lots of chlorine and it does the trick.  It conditions and leaves my hair soft and shiny, but not weighed-down and greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this hair treatment.  I usually do not repurchase many items, I love to try new things, however this is one of the few I constantly repurchase.  It leaves my hair healthy, repaired, silky, and shiny.  It has a small earthy smell, but it one I can manage.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair reconstructor that I have used. I color my hair every four weeks and flat iron my hair several times a week, so I do everything I can to prevent dryness, damage and breakage.  I saw this product on Amazon and thought I would give it a try.  It is far more effective than more expensive brands-I noticed a huge difference in the condition of my hair after just one use! Rather than pay a lot of money for products that don&#x27;t deliver, I am going to stick with Millenia Mud from now on.  It is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever, doesnt weigh hair down like some other deep conditioners! No longer available in my area. Thank goodness for amazon!</li>
    <li> Looks and feels the same, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same amazing properties it had when I was purchasing it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies. It used to help hold the style in place till the next washing - now it just softens the hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I love it. They don&#x27;t sell it at the hair supply houses here so I have to resort to buying if off amazon. I love it though, keeps your hair soft and healthy. Just look at that shine! :)</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years with great results.  Thicker hair without the weight.  Was happy to find it on line.</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find product and I&#x27;m glad it is on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in place of conditioner and it gives my hair more body and makes it easier to blow dry.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have noted, the formula seems to have changed and I agree.  When I received this tube I compared it side-by-side to an old tube.  This one is more liquid and emollient than the older formula that was more semisolid and had more &amp;#34;mudd&amp;#34;.  Too bad - this used to be my favorite conditioner because the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; seemed to add volume to my fine hair.  Now it is just too softening, just like so many other hair conditioners.  I bought it on Amazon because Sally&#x27;s and the other usual beauty supply places stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> I have used this produce for many years.  They stopped selling it a the SALLY stores so I located it on line.  I hope you keep selling it because it gives rich treatment for hair.  I use it every three days when I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Nice product...I would purchase this again...</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used on my very fine, fragile hair. Unfortunately it is very hard to find, so I am happy to have been able to order it. Excellent service from seller, and I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother&#x27;s thin hair. I have assisted her in finding healthy hair products that would give body to her hair &amp; we found this one worked best without damaging her hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It can be hard to find--that&#x27;s why I love Amazon--but it is a wonderful hair conditioner that leaves my hair in great shape without the greasy weighty feel of most products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only conditioner I use.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best deep conditioners I have ever used. I have some allergies and this product does not bother them.</li>
    <li> I fried my hair bleaching it out. This product put the moisture back in, and now my hair is soft and manageable again. Will buy more of this product when I start to run out.</li>
    <li> My hair designer recommended this product to me! \\&quot;It is a MUST HAVE/MUST DO!!!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I totally agree!!!  Adds ...softness,youth and vitality to hair texture...even after perms ,dyes,and chlorine ,,,from lap swimming.,</li>
