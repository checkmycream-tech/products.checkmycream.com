### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome product and the best Ive found since Aussie stopped making their color enhancing line.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m quite impressed with it.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This has been wonderful for me because I don&#x27;t even have to dye or bleach my hair anymore.</li>
      <li>, this is one is a good one!!!  </li>
      <li>This is excellent for us &amp;#34;wish-I-was-born-a-redhead&amp;#34; women.</li>
      <li>I am a hairstylist and I use this product in the salon with beautiful results.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Lol</li>
      <li>This product works great for me when I use it correctly.</li>
      <li>I liked!</li>
      <li>When pouring it out of the bottle, it does have a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I did not feel this did anything to keep the color bright.</li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair, with z good amount of gray, and I have been coloring my hair for over 20 years a medium auburn shade.  </li>
      <li>which it a good indicator</li>
      <li>Maybe use a good conditioner for after.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>I heard a lot of good reviews for this product</li>
      <li>I just use the shampoo and my favorite conditioner and it works just great that way.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving this stuff.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>To be honest, this stuff scares me.</li>
      <li>I just couple my uses with good conditioner and my hair still looks healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>It smells nice.</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo.</li>
      <li>By the way, it also smells pretty good!</li>
      <li>a shampoo, it is fairly stripping, even on my fine sometimes oily hair.  </li>
      <li>the Henna Jasmine-Fluff at Lush is a perfect shampoo to trade off with.</li>
      <li>I have to use more product like a smoothing treatment, leave in conditioner, &amp; a straightening balm since buying this.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I recommend it to everyone who compliments my hair.</li>
      <li>and they gave you more product for the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>I have fire red hair &amp; this product works GREAT!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>#34;Clean&amp;#34; it more so feels like</li>
      <li>While i Love the color, two things were turning me off.</li>
      <li>Maybe the shampoo is drying and the conditioner is better to compensate for it?</li>
      <li>This shampoo works even better if you leave it in your hair for 5 minutes or more before rinsing it out.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is perfect to keep the brightness of red colored hair.</li>
      <li>But to be fair, I did not use it as much as I would&#x27;ve liked, because of the lingering smell.</li>
      <li>Not the best for bottle red hair.</li>
      <li>My hair seemed drier and more brittle.</li>
      <li>Even better than the artec</li>
      <li>Beware of the accompanying conditioner though, I threw out most of a bottle</li>
      <li>That worked but not as well as Riveting Reds...</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this product.</li>
      <li>However, you absolutely MUST use a good conditioner with it, and/or a leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviews that the conditioner isn&#x27;t the best</li>
      <li>My hair has been a beautiful strawberry blonde for about a month now.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with this product and it certainly prolonged the red color way beyond my expectations  Thank you.</li>
      <li>Great for keeping you reds looking red.</li>
      <li>Also silky smooth.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy the color,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>But as long as it maintains my color, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a break out before, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it was an allergy or severe sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to use it and see results.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive this shampoo after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo with the conditioner and my hair color has stayed bright red!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered some more henna, and this SLS-free shampoo I&#x27;ve heard so much about, Tressa Watercolors.</li>
      <li>I tried using just the conditioner, and didn&#x27;t notice much difference, so I think the shampoo deposits more pigment than the conditioner does.  </li>
      <li>It does not lather at all and has a pretty strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the strong smell that stayed with me even hours after showering.</li>
      <li>I leave it on for most of my shower; it keeps my hair healthy and red!!</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t wash my hair but 1-2 times a week (which helps) and after my most recent coloring, I did use Riveting Reds.</li>
      <li>and I love the vibrant colors</li>
      <li>I am overall very satisfied with this product, however to get a noticeable effect i had to leave it on longer.</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells very pretty.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it is suppose to do!</li>
      <li>And my husband is thrilled that I&#x27;m not going to be spending a ton at the salon on a regular basis!!</li>
      <li>I have never dyed my hair in my life, I just have naturally/sun dyed colorful hair.</li>
      <li>I alternate with Shikai&#x27;s Warm Shampoo (which has henna).</li>
      <li>I always go for a bright and vibrant red.</li>
      <li>Maybe I did not use it right,</li>
      <li>I use this product in conjunction with riveting reds conditioner for optimum results on anyone with red hair or hair with red undertones and they love the lasting results.</li>
      <li>read reviews thinking that this stuff would dry my hair out, but honestly this made my hair smoother than anything.  </li>
      <li>The red dye would fade quickly and it was too much upkeep, so this seems to be a much better option.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered the Ted Gordon captivating copper stuff based on its reviews, its about the only product I haven&#x27;t tried, my review of that will be coming soon!</li>
      <li>So, the second time, I purchased the Riveting Reds shampoo.</li>
      <li>First time I used it, I couldnt see any difference in the color.</li>
      <li>If you have medium brown or darker hair, the conditioner in this series would work ok, but the shampoo will likely disappoint.</li>
      <li>This is an OK shampoo, but does not deposit enough color on the hair to suit my needs.</li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll find there are better ways to maintain your red without this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty well.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair smooth and beautiful, can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
      <li>I decided  to change things up and dyed my hair a pretty auburn color a couple months ago.</li>
      <li>This stuff is working exactly the way I wanted it to.</li>
      <li>After I first used the shampoo, I realized I just had to be mindful of how I was my hair from now on.</li>
      <li>and it fades more quickly than any other color, so</li>
      <li>an extremely bright red, like mermaid red.</li>
      <li>I actually heard of this shampoo while watching YouTube tutorials about dying my hair bright red</li>
      <li>/&gt;This really should only be used during cool or nice days, avoid this during super hot and sweaty days as any sweat from your scalp will be pink and will stain your clothing or hats.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Anyone with dyed red hair knows the horror of seeing your beautiful color run down the drain).</li>
      <li>Another thing I love is that if I go a day or two without really leaving the Red shampoo in for long, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>The seller shipped the product fast, and it was packaged nicely, however the product itself is not worth the packaging it was shipped in.</li>
      <li>As any of you know with henna, there are certain products you can use on henna hair afterwards for up keep.</li>
      <li>although more faded but still very noticeable, normally by now they are very faded and almost back to the bleached.  </li>
      <li>My natural red high-lights are looking so much more vibrant, and my hair looks redder!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived busted with red shampoo all over the box. I had about 50% of the product to actually use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or greasy and I could tell it was revitalizing the color, which is great since my almost black hair has a hard time holding color.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders! It doesn&#x27;t matter what shade of red you have, it will preserve you color tremendously. I recently ran out of my Quantum Red before I had the chance to order more and I am struggling to preserve my color. No amount of expensive color preserve shampoo or ice cold rinses can keep it from rapidly fading. I&#x27;ve not had an issue with my hair drying out like other reviewers. I just couple my uses with good conditioner and my hair still looks healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of good reviews for this product so I went to Sally&#x27;s and bought both the shampoo and conditioner.  The first thing I noticed was the strong smell that stayed with me even hours after showering. Not pleasant at all! Not only that but my showers grout was showing more red than my hair was. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this product to enhance my dyed red hair once it started looking brassy. The results were not good. My hair seemed drier and more brittle. The color faded just the same as if I had used regular shampoo. I would not buy this product again, nor would I recommend it. The key to preserving dyed red hair is washing it less frequently, using cool water, and buying a good shampoo that is very gentle on dyed hair. Red hair is high maintenance. I&#x27;ve learned the only way to keep it from looking dull and brassy is to dye it often. I&#x27;m still looking for a product that refreshes red hair without damaging it.</li>
    <li> i have..... HAD very thick, fine hair. ny hair started falling out a lot, it didnt take me until about 2 months in to realize this shampoo was making my hair fall out in clumps. my hair is thin now and i stopped using this product 2 weeks ago and my hair has stopped falling out. i will not be using this product anymore..</li>
    <li> This stuff is working exactly the way I wanted it to. I have never dyed my hair in my life, I just have naturally/sun dyed colorful hair. On the bottom is dark brown with red undertones, and on the top where the sun hits is a lighter shade of brown, with blonde undertones. Years ago, I could see red and blonde in my hair when standing in the sun, but for years I haven&#x27;t been able to, and miss it. I don&#x27;t like the idea of dying my hair, as I never want to lose all of my colors. I have found shampoos that bring out my highlights, but the blonde usually triumphs. I bought it with little thought, and took a few days to try it out, just in case it did too much change at once.&lt;br /&gt;  There was no sudden change in hair color, after a week of using it, I can see the red undertones coming through like they used to, with a little but of color change in the blonde, but nothing too drastic. I&#x27;m loving this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;  When pouring it out of the bottle, it does have a pleasant smell. It is completely red shampoo- I would say maroon. I was per-rinsing my hair, lathering it in, and leaving it in, but I could see pink water dripping down onto the floor. So now I soak my hair, drain the excess water, work it in with my hands until my hands are no longer red, there are just suds, and leave it in while I wash my body, rinse out, and then use conditioner, which as of now is my highlight conditioner. Towel dry hair, and there is no red that seeps off, and style normally. It took a few days to see it, but so far, it&#x27;s a subtle, steady red undertone that I would love to keep.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I have naturally ash blonde-brownish hair (bleh) and I&#x27;ve wanted to have strawberry blonde hair since I was in elementary school. I&#x27;m now twenty and after trying different rinses and wash out reds, I decided to go for it and dye my hair strawberry. The first time I did it, I used the Garnier Fructis color shield shampoo hoping that it would be enough to maintain the color. It wasn&#x27;t. So, the second time, I purchased the Riveting Reds shampoo. Just the shampoo and it&#x27;s amazing. My hair has been a beautiful strawberry blonde for about a month now. No touching up or anything. I love this product and I recommend it to everyone who compliments my hair. And with this shampoo, you can expect to get lots of compliments.   What I do is use John Frieda&#x27;s lightening shampoo, then leave the Red shampoo in for a few minutes and finish off with Ion&#x27;s leave-in conditioner. With this routine, I find myself with pretty blonde, shiny hair with some streaks of strawberry. Not too red, but enough to where it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s there. These products are not drying out or damaging my hair either. I just got a hair cut the other day and the stylist couldn&#x27;t stop complimenting how healthy it was.   This has been wonderful for me because I don&#x27;t even have to dye or bleach my hair anymore. Anyone looking to maintain red color or just add a touch of it should definitely try this.  Another thing I love is that if I go a day or two without really leaving the Red shampoo in for long, it&#x27;s okay. The red does fade a little. But then, when I have time, I can leave it in longer the next day and my hair will look like it did before. It&#x27;s fun to play around with the different shades of red. And it&#x27;s acceptable too because the differences are very subtle.</li>
    <li> I am overall very satisfied with this product, however to get a noticeable effect i had to leave it on longer. Typically i would put it on, do laundry and some cleaning and then hop in the shower. 30 plus minutes. Does not stain tile or acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> Not what was hoping for.  But for $10 I am not too surprised</li>
    <li> Admittedly, i&#x27;ve never used any other red color replenishing shampoos, but i do know that i&#x27;ve had my hair bright red for a month now and this shampoo has kept it from fading AT ALL. ...Well, my hairline is a bit faded, but that part comes in contact with water/face wash multiple times a day and i only used semi-permanent dye to begin with, so i don&#x27;t fault the shampoo at all for that.     By the way, it also smells pretty good!</li>
    <li> I have brown hair which, recently I dyed a shade or two darker.  It didn&#x27;t look bad, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was going for.  After a couple of washes, the color was still very dark, but just light enough to take some color.  I picked this up (I was looking for artec, which no one seems to have anymore) and used it and it added *just* the right amount of red- literally just a hint of red - but it made such a difference and I&#x27;m quite impressed with it.  I used to get red highlights in attempt to get the same effect.  The red dye would fade quickly and it was too much upkeep, so this seems to be a much better option.  Even better than the artec I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews thinking that this stuff would dry my hair out, but honestly this made my hair smoother than anything.  Maybe the shampoo is drying and the conditioner is better to compensate for it?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other color depositing shampoos that actually gave my ashy highlights a warm glow. This one just makes pink lather, no matter how long I leave it in. I understand it&#x27;s meant to replenish color to hair that is colored treated and extend time between coloring - but if it didn&#x27;t deposit any color in my highlights, I don&#x27;t see how it could replenish anything at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well. I used it years ago but they stopped selling it in the stores locally. My hair is naturally red but got a little darker as I got older. This brings out the red highlights. Putting it on before washing and letting it sit for a few minutes helps. It can dry out your hair a little, so condition.</li>
    <li> This product definitely does the job! If you have artificially colored red hair like I do, you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things to note:&lt;br /&gt;1. In the moment, it will turn your hands red, as well as your bath water (and in the shower you will probably see red as you rinse your hair). Don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t actually dye your skin permanently. By the time I&#x27;m out of the bath or shower, my hands are back to normal again.&lt;br /&gt;2. If your hair is naturally blonde underneath the red, and if in some areas it has already faded back to blonde, this shampoo may give you an orangey-red spectrum of colors. I actually really like it, but use with caution if your color is faded to that point and you don&#x27;t like orange hues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3 Hannah</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this shampoo after reading so many positive reviews.  I have medium brown hair, with z good amount of gray, and I have been coloring my hair for over 20 years a medium auburn shade.  I purchased this shampoo as a way to touch up my color and/or hide my roots until I can color again.  I have now used this shampoo 6 times and I do not see any difference?  Now maybe, as I have read, I did not leave it on long enough?  I used it in the shower, and applied a generous amount, and left it on (I timed this) for a total of 5 minutes.  It did not color my gray hair at all, which is what I was mainly going for.  Maybe I did not use it right, long enough, too little and maybe my expectations were unreasonable to begin with.  I was expecting a result like I received when I used color depositing shampoos in the 1980&#x27;s.  Now those shampoos, were truly color depositing!  Maybe they found out the chemicals were toxic and had to pull them off the shelves and discontinue use of that ingredient in their shampoos, but in any case, I was disappointed with my results.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and I use this product in the salon with beautiful results. I use this product in conjunction with riveting reds conditioner for optimum results on anyone with red hair or hair with red undertones and they love the lasting results. I recommend this to clients as well as to my friends and family. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product on and off for years to maintain my colored red hair. I never liked the condition it left my hair in, and wondered if I was crazy when my hair seemed duller to me after using it. However, after noticing that it turns my shower pink, I started wondering: Auburn/red +pink wouldn&#x27;t equal more red would it? I decided to do an experiment. I washed one section of my hair with it and left it on for 20 minutes. When I rinsed it and dried it, I could see NO difference between that section and the rest of my hair, except it felt worse. I asked my husband and he too could see no difference. Perhaps if you had a really burgundy, cooler red, some pink deposit would give you a boost, but for most of us who want a more natural auburn/copper look, I don&#x27;t think its worth the shower stains or bad condition it leaves your hair in.  I have ordered the Ted Gordon captivating copper stuff based on its reviews, its about the only product I haven&#x27;t tried, my review of that will be coming soon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what people expect for the price. The reason it leaves certain people&#x27;s hair dry is because you&#x27;re washing and conditioning your hair with COLOR. If you think about it, coloring your hair too often dries your hair out. You should alternate between regular (safe for colored treated hair) shampoo/conditioner. This product works great for me when I use it correctly. I have been a \\&quot;red head\\&quot; for about seven years.</li>
    <li> Ehhh, doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair worse but I do not believe that it helped preserve my color and I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of color enhancing shampoos and spent lots of money trying to find the right one.  Red is ALWAYS the easiest color to fade out and it fades more quickly than any other color, so using a color-depositing shampoo is critical for maintaining the color between salon visits.  I&#x27;m a natural brunette.  After a coloring, it usually takes about 2 weeks of daily shampoos for my color to noticeably fade and become less red and more yellow.  With this shampoo, my color stays red for MUCH longer.  Now I only need to get an all-over touch up, once every 3 months.  Saves me a lot of money and my hair a lot of damage.  This shampoo works even better if you leave it in your hair for 5 minutes or more before rinsing it out.  I tried using just the conditioner, and didn&#x27;t notice much difference, so I think the shampoo deposits more pigment than the conditioner does.  I just use the shampoo and my favorite conditioner and it works just great that way.  Awesome product and the best Ive found since Aussie stopped making their color enhancing line.</li>
    <li> I think you&#x27;ll find there are better ways to maintain your red without this product. It&#x27;s ok. I can&#x27;t say I noticed a difference, but I appreciated that it was gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde and have kept my hair this way for most of my life. I decided  to change things up and dyed my hair a pretty auburn color a couple months ago. While i Love the color, two things were turning me off. The red faded out quickly leaving my hair brown, and where my hair was growing out...my blonde roots were making it appear that I had a receding hairline. I was having to do a root touch up every two weeks. Since I started using this shampoo and conditioner, not only is my red not fading as quickly, but the pigment in the shampoo is providing a nice transition in my blonde roots.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product. It stains my hands, which is to be expected, but does nothing for my hair. It washes it but does not deposit color. I&#x27;ve used other brands of color depositing shampoo without issue. For the price of this shampoo, I really expected more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It helps my box color stay for months. I use it as directed and I use it everyday. I have people asking me if I dyed my hair again after it has been over a month. Great product. Takes a few washes to work.</li>
    <li> It works very well.. Keeps the light white hairs of mine by my temples at a red color  now... Always use it from now on...</li>
    <li> My hair was a vibrant Crayola red.  I used this to stop, or at least slow, the inevitable color fade.  I didn&#x27;t  notice any real benefit to using this shampoo but my skin violently broke out all down my back and shoulderst.  I&#x27;ve never had a break out before, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it was an allergy or severe sensitivity.  I threw the rest of it away and within days the rash and irritation cleared up.  If you do buy it, test a little area of your skin first just to be safe.  I usually don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never reacted to hair dye (and I color my hair all the time).</li>
    <li> Winds up making my hands pink in the shower.. but I guess my hair keeps the color a little longer.</li>
    <li> This was purchased with conditioner. It was one of the brands I tried out recently to refresh my fading red hair. I did not notice much in the way of color refreshing, and it is by far one of the least conditioning conditioners I have ever tried. My hair was dry and stiff after using it. I was forced to rewash and condition with another brand in order to get a comb through my hair. The seller shipped the product fast, and it was packaged nicely, however the product itself is not worth the packaging it was shipped in.</li>
    <li> I use this to conceal a few snarky greys mixed in with my naturally red hair...it works well!!  I leave it on for most of my shower; it keeps my hair healthy and red!! I also used Clairol Shimmering Lights until Sally discontinued it.  That worked but not as well as Riveting Reds...the Henna Jasmine-Fluff at Lush is a perfect shampoo to trade off with.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for us &amp;#34;wish-I-was-born-a-redhead&amp;#34; women. However, you absolutely MUST use a good conditioner with it, and/or a leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Didnt notice any major changes in making my red not bleed out between salon visits.  No better or worse then any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is a must-have for colored redheads.  Dyed red hair is notorious for fading everytime you wash it so you no longer have to fear!!! not with this product!!! it deposits red onto your hair!! the actual shampoo and conditioner are red and when you wash it you can see it deposits color!  I have naturally black hair which I bleach then I dye red so trust me, this is one is a good one!!!  It leaves my hair smooth and beautiful, can&#x27;t go wrong.  This is a MUST-HAVE!!</li>
    <li> This is my go to shampoo for slowing down the red hair bleed. This shampoo deposits color which can help keep away the copper tones that develop when my color starts to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really should only be used during cool or nice days, avoid this during super hot and sweaty days as any sweat from your scalp will be pink and will stain your clothing or hats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviews that the conditioner isn&#x27;t the best but I still use it, I just blend it with another conditioner so I can get the benefit of some extra color deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful</li>
    <li> Great for keeping you reds looking red.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m spoiled my my paraban-sulfate chocked shampoos, but I hate hate HATED this shampoo. It was a weird consistancy, did not suds up at all, and it made my shower look like I had a visit from Dexter. I purchased at Sally&#x27;s on sale &amp; I was stuck with a vat of gross &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; bleh! really turned me off to the whole Quantum brand.</li>
    <li> Yes this helped with my red hair but it also did absolutely nothing for my hair it left it dry and seemed to do more damage then it did to help.  Now it sits next to it&#x27;s brother (conditioner) in my cabinet waiting to be used again one day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair red for almost 10 years. I do often get tired of having to recolor so often. But, that goes with the territory. For years I&#x27;d been using John Frieda&#x27;s Radiant Red. While not color depositing, it does leave my hair just that, radiant. Also silky smooth. Trying to find something that would help with fading, I set off to Sally&#x27;s and discovered Riveting Reds to be the only color depositing shampoo and conditioner for red and it was on sale. So, I figured what the heck. Now, mind you, I don&#x27;t wash my hair but 1-2 times a week (which helps) and after my most recent coloring, I did use Riveting Reds. I thought it was just because it was color depositing and for dyed hair that it felt the way it did in my hair. But, after turning my shower pink (that&#x27;s the only color change I&#x27;ve noticed anywhere), my hair looks dull. Trying to brush it (it&#x27;s a little longer than shoulder length, fine, and poker straight) is an absolute nightmare while it&#x27;s wet. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before with ANY other shampoo or conditioner I&#x27;ve used. I really wish this would have worked. But, my hair looking like I dyed it months ago and washed it a couple dozen times after TWO washes with what is supposed to help red hair, I&#x27;ll suck up my $ 15 loss and search for something else while going back to John Frieda in the meantime.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to order this shampoo as I&#x27;ve heard both good and bad things about it, but so far I like it. I don&#x27;t have any issues with it staining my shower or my towels as others have reviewed on here. I don&#x27;t really notice any change of texture with my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it makes my hair softer feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw or anything. I also really like the smell of it and my (dyed) red hair looked brighter in color after using it.</li>
    <li> My hair is a dark strawberry blonde, or very light red, super fine slippery texture (usually soaks color right up). This shampoo leaves my hands and shower PINK, but deposits no color in my hair, despite using is as directed for a full 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a shampoo, it is fairly stripping, even on my fine sometimes oily hair.  For someone with normal or dry hair, this would be even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the conditioner a year or so previous, and it does leave subtle but unevenly absorbed pinky magenta color in the hair, which for me, is not a good thing. I hoped the shampoo would be more subtle and less cheap looking on lighter colored hair.  If you have medium brown or darker hair, the conditioner in this series would work ok, but the shampoo will likely disappoint.</li>
    <li> I actually heard of this shampoo while watching YouTube tutorials about dying my hair bright red and it was highly recommended. I used Loreal Excellence HiColor HiLites for dark hair only in Red to dye my hair about a month ago. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo with the conditioner and my hair color has stayed bright red! Of course, i have been using other techniques for keeping my red hair like only washing my hair twice a week with cold water and using dry shampoo in between washes. I use this shampoo very sparingly since it is a bit pricey and the bottle isn&#x27;t that big. It comes out a deep red color that actually puts color back into your hair. (Anyone with dyed red hair knows the horror of seeing your beautiful color run down the drain). It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, skin, or bathroom surfaces. Honestly, this stuff is great. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and they gave you more product for the price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and I think I&#x27;m allergic because I have acne breakouts every time I use it but I did get what was described</li>
    <li> I bought my Shampoo from Sally&#x27;s for twice as much compared to the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Although the Shampoo is quite red in color, I did not notice it help much at all&lt;br /&gt;with the color of my hair, it smells okay, but it leave my scalp DIRTY?! Creates build up,&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s not me cause I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dandruff before and the build up is&lt;br /&gt;actually pink (from the shampoo &amp; conditioner.) Also when I stopped using this shampoo I no longer had&lt;br /&gt;any build up. Made my hair brittle, dry, and just awful really.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to tolerate using the rest of the bottles because I paid so much for them, but they&#x27;re really&lt;br /&gt;awful, even Hotel shampoo works better on my hair than this crap.</li>
    <li> I did not feel this did anything to keep the color bright. I think its a gimmick. Just use what you got. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair for some time and I love the vibrant colors, my current style involves a deep, rich and bright red with neon purple and pink stripes at the front.  My natural color is a strawberry blonde and although the reds tend to blend better with my roots as it grows out the vibrant part normally fades out along with the purples and pinks.  On my last color with a new stylist she told me to look for different shampoo and conditioner, specifically one designed for reds.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at several different brands and took the chance on this one and I was really surprised.  I am a mother of 3 with another on the way so I am busy, I get to wash my hair 1-2 times a week and this product has really kept my color, I am now at about 7 weeks since I had my hair dyed and I have 1/2&amp;#34; of new growth but the red is still very bright and only a few shades faded, the purple and pinks have also stayed in pretty well although more faded but still very noticeable, normally by now they are very faded and almost back to the bleached.  I don&#x27;t use much other product just some frizz-ez sometimes and maybe a small amount of moose when drying but I do use hair dryers and hair straighteners, the straighteners almost daily at the moment with the abundance of pregnancy hormones my hair is pretty crazy.  I have not felt any residue on my hair and have not noticed it feeling drier than before ( I used to use treseme products).  My hair is pretty unmanageable but it always has been and especially with pregnancy so nothing new since I changed.  I also have hot showers and not cool and still the color has lasted.</li>
    <li> Dyes both my hair and hands red. I feel it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job though, cleaning and slightly redying especially if you keep it in for a bit. As advice, I&#x27;d recommend only washing your hair twice a week and using ONLY COLD WATER. If you put other products in your hair, try to keep it in as short as possible.</li>
    <li> My hair is more strawberry blonde now and this shampoo has been helpful in blending the few spots of gray into the red and blonde. I alternate with Shikai&#x27;s Warm Shampoo (which has henna).</li>
    <li> I have used this for some time now as I have vibrant red (dyed) hair that as we all know is high maintenance. This shampoo seems to help keep my color from fading as fast. Be prepared to keep it on for a few minutes though in order for it to work. I do notice that with frequent use it tends to build up after a while. Other than that I really like the shampoo. Beware of the accompanying conditioner though, I threw out most of a bottle cause the conditioner is horrible. It left my hair dry and stringy and it doesnt even offer and benefits to my red. Ill stick with the shampoo and just use a different conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is suppose to do! Anyone looking to compare the Riveting Red Color Line with the Watercolor  line should go with this product instead of the latter. I&#x27;ve used both products and have been a redhead for over two years. The Watercolor products turned my hair slightly purple. Although if you&#x27;re a beginner with color deposit shampoos, I would go to the salon and get my hair professionally dyed red and then supplement it with the Riveting Red shampoo and another sulfate free shampoo. Dry shampooing several times a week isn&#x27;t a bad idea either. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product and it certainly prolonged the red color way beyond my expectations  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have colored my hair red (I am a natural blonde) using henna for over a year now.  Using this shampoo keeps it from fading and lengthens the time between having to have the henna applied.</li>
    <li> I have always had natural strawberry-blonde hair, but after having two kids and turning 30, my red was starting to fade out. My hair was looking more blonde, and I was really unhappy about it. Seeking to find an alternative to paying a lot at the salon for red high-lights, I did some research and found this shampoo &amp; conditioner. After just a few days, I could see a difference! My natural red high-lights are looking so much more vibrant, and my hair looks redder! I LOVE it! And my husband is thrilled that I&#x27;m not going to be spending a ton at the salon on a regular basis!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo / Conditioner really keeps my color from fading as fast, but unfortunately I&#x27;ve noticed it drys my hair something fierce. I have to use more product like a smoothing treatment, leave in conditioner, &amp; a straightening balm since buying this.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells very pretty. It does not clean my hair what so ever. I had done my hair in curls so i sprayed hairspray in it. I didn&#x27;t like the way it came out so i washed it. I blow dried it and it still smelled like my hair spray. A few days later it was sticky and itchy. The next time the same thing happened. I also noticed no difference in the redness of my hair. Definitely never buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I should have returned it because it&#x27;s not creamy at all, and I have fading red hair, and I saw no change at all.  In my opinion, it was a waste of money.  I have thrown it away.</li>
    <li> I have fire red hair &amp; this product works GREAT!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I recently dyed my hair with red henna. As any of you know with henna, there are certain products you can use on henna hair afterwards for up keep. Red can be stripped from your brown hair with any conditioner with alcohol (pantene for example), shampoos with any SLS, etc. I have had such a hard love/hate relationship with this shampoo. When putting it in your hand to shampoo, it comes out like fake blood - which it a good indicator it should have a lot of red pigment to distribute to your hair. I was so excited to use it and see results. I actually lathered it in, removed the extra suds since it lathers like crazy, and just coated some more of it on top. When I got out of the shower and blow-dried my hair, my hair has been looking less and less red. I&#x27;m not sure if this has anything to do with the fact his shampoo has SLS, and strips the color and tries to put it back in or whatever, but it turned out to be a dud for me. I&#x27;ve already ordered some more henna, and this SLS-free shampoo I&#x27;ve heard so much about, Tressa Watercolors. For the raving reviews, I have to wonder if this product only works particularly well on already damaged chemically treated/colored hair.</li>
    <li> I used this when it arrived yesterday along with the Conditioner. I didn&#x27;t see any results in my hair. My hair is dark with red on top and on the ends. I will continue to use it daily to see if it adds any color .</li>
    <li> At first this shampoo seems okay, it does have that chemical smell that most color-depositing/toning shampoos have, but it was tolerable in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;However, I did notice that it leaves a smell on my hair afterward that is very unpleasant. The only way I can describe it as a &amp;#34;burning plastic&amp;#34; smell. It lingered on my hair for hours and hours after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t notice much change to my red hair. But to be fair, I did not use it as much as I would&#x27;ve liked, because of the lingering smell.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed with this shampoo. It does not lather at all and has a pretty strong chemical smell. I do want to try to keep my red from fading but this is not good for an everyday shampoo. I use it like once a week, so not sure it really does anything at that little use.</li>
    <li> Being a red head is a lot of work! If you don&#x27;t have the patience, time, or money for up keep, then choose an easier color to work with! If you put up with all of what was mentioned above to be a sassy red head, then using a color depositing shampoo will help you out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am naturally a brunette, but have been a red head off and on for years. I only recently found out about color depositing shampoos from my hair dresser, and man I have to say that I wish I knew about them sooner! Now when I get my hair done I always go for a bright and vibrant red. I know out of all the redish choices I could choose from that choosing a more vibrant one is harder to keep up with, but I say go big or go home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with my vibrant red hair, this shampoo has definitely helped keep my hair noticeably more vibrant than if I had used my normal color protecting shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw in some reviews that people wrote that they didn&#x27;t like how the color gets all over the shower. I don&#x27;t think this would happen from just this partiualr color deposiiting shampoo, but I&#x27;ve tried another one and it happens as well with the other product. After I first used the shampoo, I realized I just had to be mindful of how I was my hair from now on. I couldn&#x27;t just go crazy and lather away like normal. This makes sense since after all your washing your hair with hair dye! Now I purposefully wash it and am really careful and nothing turns pink!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair dresser and I dye my hair an extremely bright red, like mermaid red. This stuff saved me from having to redye it every 3 weeks. I wash my hair 2-3x a week in slightly warm to room temp water with this shampoo, leave it in for 5+ minutes, and then condition my ends with intensive repair Dove conditioner and rinse with cold water. I air dry my hair and rarely put heat on it as well. Now I only have to redye every 10 weeks.</li>
    <li> I recently became a red head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dyed my hair red about two months ago and I enjoy the color,&lt;br /&gt;but like just about every person who has dyed their hair--they know&lt;br /&gt;its hard to maintain the color. To be honest, this stuff scares me. Lol&lt;br /&gt;It bleeds like a slit throat, stains your skin and scalp. I suppose it maintains&lt;br /&gt;the color, but I usually have to wash my hair with a different shampoo before hand&lt;br /&gt;because it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel... &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; it more so feels like&lt;br /&gt;I put blood in my hair, then rinsed it out. But as long as it maintains my color, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is perfect to keep the brightness of red colored hair. It smells nice. The product is red, and add some red as I wash my hair. Without it, I&#x27;d lose some red. Nice shampoo. I&#x27;ll buy more of it when my bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> This is an OK shampoo, but does not deposit enough color on the hair to suit my needs. First time I used it, I couldnt see any difference in the color. It takes several shampoos to see any color change at all. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I liked! Maybe use a good conditioner for after.</li>
    <li> Not the best for bottle red hair. Really washes out color. IT HAS SULFATE</li>
</ol>
