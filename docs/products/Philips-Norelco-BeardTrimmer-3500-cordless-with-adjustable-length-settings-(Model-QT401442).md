<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I own the QT4014 - Used this baby for nearly a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong. While I don&#x27;t aim for the bushy beard style (for now), I wouldn&#x27;t doubt its capability of trimming it nice and clean. I have my settings around 3-3.5, use it at least once a week (along with a razor for the extra hair on the neck), spend a minute or two, and it keeps me at a perfectly smooth scruff that people compliment me on.    People seem to complain about the shape, power switch, noise, whatever. I found no problems with any. I found the shape to be just fine as it makes the shavings less likely to fall all over your hands, and it is even better used for the neck area (just raise your head and enjoy the massage). I would assume it fairs just as well for my bearded friends. It is a little noisy, just a tiny bit, but that was never my concern since it&#x27;s a proud reminder that a man is simply grooming himself. As for power, It seems to run just fine for a while without charging. I think I&#x27;ve charged it maybe 4 or 5 times in the past 10 months, and only one of those times seemed like it needed a charge.    I&#x27;m not going to over extend, just buy this thing already.    I recommend getting the Philips Norelco NT9130 D-Finer Precision Trimmer along with this for the more precise work, such as hair reaching the lips, uneven levels, eyebrows, etc. Both serve well together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the smaller hair clippers for my beard, my brother bought one and recommended it. I purchased it and have received it about a month ago. It has the dial in the middle to adjust sizes, the whole top part comes apart for easy cleaning. No batteries, just has the wall charger which saves me on buying batteries. I love this thing, and would recommend it for any guy who likes to keep the stubble or a shorter facial hair look.</li>
    <li> Great item, but the adjustable head flexes and might not give you the accurate length in .5mm increments. But overall its good enough</li>
    <li> bought this for the sole purpose to trim my arm hairs and add a sort of &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34; effect to my arm hair(having just cut line from bald to hair is horrible and you should not do that to yourself) so i can be hairless from my shoulders to about my elbows and the rest just neatly trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product definitely does the job and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, easy to clean product.</li>
    <li> LOOKS GOOD;TRIMMING SO SO</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times so far, and it is nice to easily trim my beard quickly (I&#x27;ve been using small scissors for 30 years). I&#x27;m still learning what depth to use and how to manipulate the trimmer over different areas.</li>
    <li> Excellent at its price</li>
    <li> Nice easy action, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Did anyone else have a loose comb adjustment maybe mine was a defect :( if it wasn&#x27;t loose it would be 5 star</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for 40+ years.  This trimmer is just gold!</li>
    <li> I love it for its battery life.  I trim my beard every day.  One charge lasts me close to a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a few months now. At first I was unsure which trimmer to buy because it was my first time purchasing one. Now I definitely think I&#x27;ve made the right choice by getting this one! I&#x27;m very happy with it, it cuts my facial hair at all the lengths I would want it to. Very clean smooth trimming and I&#x27;ve never cut my face using it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different beard trimmers along the way that never really did the job well. This one trumps them all. I especially like the fact I dont have to use oil, I can wash the head off and the blades are never dull. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> The best trimmer I ever purchased.</li>
    <li> As most other reviewers have said, this thing works really well, its easy to clean, and the battery has a long life. My only issue would be that for people wanting the 10 or less day stubble, you will be using 2.5 to 1 - so most of the range provided is well past what you want. For me not a problem - I&#x27;m using 1.5</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a great job of trimming a long beard into what some consider scruff. Also great for trimming back and chest hair. Doesn&#x27;t cut too short, but it&#x27;s not supposed to. Cause it&#x27;s a trimmer, not a razor.</li>
    <li> my son requested that and is happy with it.  He looks better so i&#x27;m happy with it</li>
    <li> Works extremely well.  I highly recommend it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Norelco</li>
    <li> Based on the suspect packaging, I suspect I received a fraudulent product? Alternatively, the quality of this product is just embarrassingly poor. It felt lighter and less sturdy than one of my kids toys. Will be returning this and getting something that is a little more sturdy than this Pez dispenser doubling as a beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that something so cheap can do such a good job!  Call me a skeptic, but after reading other Amazon reviews, I figured I would give the Philips QT4014 a try.  I&#x27;ve typically spent $50+ on previous trimmers, but the last one that I bought two years ago was really disappointing.  I bought this Philips trimmer a couple of months ago, and have been very pleased with it&#x27;s charge, width of the trim area, and ability of it to trim my stubble with a single pass (and without pulling hair!).  The only gripe I have is that the adjustment control feels a bit flimsy, and doesn&#x27;t strike me as something that will last for the next 5 years.  Hopefully I&#x27;m wrong, as the rest of this trimmer will stay in my cabinet for the next 10 years.  And if it breaks, well - a good $25 trimmer that lasts 5 years is alright in my books - money well spent.</li>
    <li> garbage, using it for 6 month and it died out. It doesnt work anymore. Pure garbage.</li>
    <li> I have tried many trimmers over the years for my beard and this is the best one yet. I have different lengths depending on the time of year and my mood, and this one works great for shorter or longer lengths.</li>
    <li> Not worth for that money.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old model that finally died after years of use, and I&#x27;m happier with this one, so a nice surprise.  Sharp, fast, easy to operate, long battery life, and a 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> Great small trimmer that is very effective.  It charges quickly (1 hour) and last for 60 minutes after the charge.  I like the charging LED which many of the lower end trimmers don&#x27;t have.  The comb settings seem fairly precise and the blades do not pull the hair.  The small size makes it comfortable to hold and maneuver.  The comb pulls off to allow for side burn shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d like to see across the board is having plastic stands to hold the trimmers.  It takes up more room on my limited counter space because it only lies down.  With a stand it&#x27;s 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am not a hairy man. This is particularly the case for the crown of my head, which is one stressful working day from looking like misshapen toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, have thick hair round the side of my head, like a Chaucerian monk. I&#x27;ve been using this shaver since 2012 for my face and head, and have never been disappointed. Reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Quick to charge - Long life battery - excellent range of lengths - durable when dropped (hangover) - waterproof (when dropped in the toilet - hangover) - pretty sleek (as if it matters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say buy it - there will be no regrets.</li>
    <li> works good, battery is good, cleans easy, it just do its job the way it should</li>
    <li> This is an awesome trimmer for facial hair and does the job very well. It is highly adjustable starting at 0.5 mm and increments by 0.5 mm each setting. This makes for perfect stubble and fading thicker facial hair areas (for me my goat tee and mustache area has thicker coverage so I go down an extra setting to fade it perfectly). Seriously I get barber shop quality trims with this baby. No snagging of hairs and the plastic guard is very gentle on your face with no scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I gave it 4 out of 5 starts for a couple of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1) While using on your face, you have to pass over areas 3-4 times to get all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2) Not great for man-scaping. Just like reason #1, but on body hair it seems I have to pass over areas even more times just to get all the hairs cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this trimmer isn&#x27;t really marketed for body hair trimming I didn&#x27;t take another star away, but if that&#x27;s something you need, be aware that this may not be your &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; solution. I can&#x27;t speak on longer bear trimming, but if you are looking for a consistent and highly adjustable stubble trimmer, this is the one! I have used many different trimmers from different brands throughout the years and so far this is by far the best I have used to keep my sexy man stubble fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This is the beard trimmer you want! My previous trimmer was the wahl lithium ion, and though I am overall satisfied with the quality, it just doesn&#x27;t cut with the guard attached. I would have to trim my beard all the way down to a five o&#x27;clock shadow and let it grow back to my desired length. But with this bad boy, those days are over! Trims perfectly with one swipe, and not nearly as messy as my previous trimmer. If you are thinking about one for yourself or for someone else, BUY IT. You can&#x27;t beat the price especially for the quality.</li>
    <li> Delivers as expected !!</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. I bought this to replace my aging Norelco trimmer which had the old style batteries which required hours and hours of charging for a very short run time. This trimmer, on the other hand, charges up super quick and that lasts for weeks at a time with a few minutes of use every couple of days. The blades seem sharp and the motor is powerful enough that I have never had this trimmer stutter from the load. The length adjustment is extremely easy to use and the attachment pops out easily to give you the &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; length. Initially, I was concerned that the battery was not Li-ion, but so far the battery life has been great. The only downside I can see is that this doesn&#x27;t come with attachments that the other trimmers come with at a similar cost. But, I feel like you get a better quality trimmer and blade, and I don&#x27;t need all the attachments anyway.</li>
    <li> It works as it should. Charges quickly, cuts evenly. I like the adjustable clip as opposed to having several different size clips to keep around.</li>
    <li> The beard trimmer does what I expected of it: trims my beard. The charge is lasting much longer than my previous trimmer, which is a nice feature. I docked it one star because it does not trim as closely as I would like when the comb is removed</li>
    <li> Works ok.  Great for trimming for a shadow but definitely does not cut as close as a lot of others.</li>
    <li> its ok for its price. its loud and you need to run it several times to get a better result unlike my other shaver ( moser)</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  This is the best beard trimmer he&#x27;s ever had!  The length setting is very easy to set!</li>
    <li> Low-quality, disposable trash.  My previous Norelco trimmer finally died after nearly 10 years.  With a run like that, I was feeling quite a bit of brand loyalty.  That goodwill is gone now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is made of extremely lightweight, flimsy plastic.  The old trimmer was mostly plastic too, but it was an obviously higher grade/weight.  The old trimmer also had some rubber on the lower half to promote good grip.  This trimmer does not have that, and can be a little slippery if your hands are damp from washing or from sweat.  Even the clipper guard is lightweight and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe, though - and this trimmer&#x27;s unforgivable sin - is unacceptable mechanical performance.  It takes over an hour to charge, but that charge only lasts about 10-15 minutes.  You could get better from a solar cell!  Straight out of the box, the motor grunted and wheezed like a dying rhinoceros.  RPM&#x27;s varied wildly, often dipping alarmingly low, and as a result the trimmer did not cut well.  After a couple weeks, frustration caused me to give this trimmer a bit of &amp;#34;kinetic engineering&amp;#34; (i.e. a firm smack against the side of the cabinet), and lo and behold the motor instantly jumped up to a steady and robust RPM, which tells me something was either seated or soldered poorly at the factory.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), the cheap, flimsy clipper guard broke about a week later, so I&#x27;ve already replaced this low-grade junk with a Remington (model VPG6530), with which I am much more satisfied (it isn&#x27;t perfect, but for a sub-$50 cordless, it&#x27;s pretty decent).  This Norelco is junk, with 20/20 hindsight, I wouldn&#x27;t have even paid $10 for it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! Enough said!</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Worth the money.. Trims pretty even and fast. And with ease</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. Just used it and I look great. Great quality and guarantee. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one and good price. John Snuff</li>
    <li> A great trimmer. The best one I have used so far.</li>
    <li> Great Trimmer! This has a lot of settings to the 5 o clock shadow look and up. This is especially good if you like to keep your beard short. Not sure how good it would be for a very long beard. My husband wears his short and stubbly, and if you like that, you&#x27;ll love this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great I should have had one long ago.</li>
    <li> I see lots of silly reviews here, discussing things like &#x27;how its packaged&#x27; and how easy it is to turn on or off. Based on the growing incentives offered for some reviewers, it is no surprise that these reviews are beginning to pollute Amazon&#x27;s content quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my review is about the product, how it worked for me, and its quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came pre-charged and after reading the instructions I decided to charge it a bit further before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the three times I was able to use it as a beard trimmer, it offered a mediocre trim &amp; shave (I had to make several passes over the same location, and even then, the cut seemed a bit inconsistent). On the fourth time I used it, an initial flip of the power slider resulted in nothing. After tweaking the shave depth dial, the power kicked on. On the fifth time I used it, nothing. The Philips Norelco QT 4014/42 Beard Trimmer 3500, was dead inside of 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 1 star. Item is advertised as a beard trimmer. Item works poorly as a beard trimmer. Item is built poorly so as to break within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is pretty irrelevant to people, right? This isn&#x27;t a fragile item and Amazon does a good job packing. Unboxing is a stupid thing to review on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it once and giving it five stars is equally silly, especially if your 5 star review doesn&#x27;t focus on the quality of the shave.</li>
    <li> Does not have all the attachments.</li>
    <li> This was an okay beard trimmer, but become stuck turned \\&quot;on\\&quot; after only 8 months of use.  We returned home to find the device very hot to the touch and stuck in a turned on state.  We could not get the device to turn off and it was a potetntial fire hazard.  Due to the fire risk, this device had to be immediately removed from the apartment and thrown in the dumpster.  Due to the fact that we no longer had the device (it was a fire hazard and had to be thrown away, remember), I was informed by customer service that they would not honor a warranty claim on their faulty product even though I had my original receipts and documentation. Bad customer service and a faulty product. My advice to anyone reading this would be to purchase a device from a different company. Stay away from Philips Norelco and their poor customer service.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. Adjusts to every hair-beard length setting I might need. Don&#x27;t know why anyone would need one of the Phil-Norelco trimmer models that cost twice as much. This one is perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> nothing miraculous to add to the rest of the reviews. It does a good job. the adjustability without having to keep track of any guards is awesome. like others said, it is kind of loud for a beard trimmer but not so it&#x27;s obnoxious. it would have been nice to have come with a stand but I guess organized people just put theirs away &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I bought this for my goatee. Totally disappointed as I doesn&#x27;t do a clean even cut. Also the blade is no sharp enough</li>
    <li> Just Ok .Rsally cant so it the best out there , Found I get better results with the Whal &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> A+++! Great quality and great price!</li>
    <li> It certainly does the job. The lowest setting is great for getting a stubble look. And the battery lasts a lot, definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Very nice one. I used it for both my beard and hair trimming.</li>
    <li> Worked OK but I didn&#x27;t like the way I looked with 5 o&#x27; clock shadow. Returned it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works better than expected</li>
    <li> Its a beard trimmer and it works, what more could you want? Its a shame its not waterproof but for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be.</li>
    <li> Very good and fast trimmer.</li>
    <li> Bought this on March 24 2013, item arrived March 30 2013. It&#x27;s Sep 4 2013 and the thing no longer works properly.  The blades keep stopping altogether and that results in pinching of the skin or pulling of the hair. $40 is what I paid for it ... that&#x27;s $40 down the drain. I bought this to replace a cheaper Norelco G370. That trimmer lasted just over 2 years before giving up the ghost. This one couldn&#x27;t even make it a year. Definitely NOT a product I would recommend you buy.</li>
    <li> Awesome trimmer with various settings and adjustable guard for body or beard trimming!</li>
    <li> Should be noted that this trimmer is only useful for 4 - 5 day stubble or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as a trimmer for eyebrows, armpits, sideburns it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Cheap things very handy</li>
    <li> Works fine for the price.</li>
    <li> Adjustable trim length makes the husband very happy.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer. I can almost garantee that this is one of the best trimmers that you can find for this price. I use to have another one costlier....Philips as well.. what a waste of money. If you are looking a trimmer that can cut through a tick hair and a leave a nice shadow in your face, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> holds a charge for months. very good and sharp cut.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace a TERRIBLE Wahl kit.  My boyfriend loves it! Only downside is that the guard has to be emptied often from the hair collecting but that is no issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for months and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once. I have really curly beard hair, and I keep it really short, trimming every three or four days and I there is no reason not to like this trimmer. After the first use, something smelled bad, and it looked like something under the removable trimmer-part had melted, but since it works fine, I&#x27;m assuming that was either intended or not vital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have to make several passes with the trimmer when I have the black guard on. I&#x27;ts more than I&#x27;d like, but I can&#x27;t exactly complain either. For the money, I see nothing wrong with it and I&#x27;ve recommended it to both my brother and father who can never seem to find a good trimmer</li>
    <li> Trims good, easy to adjust and charges fast.</li>
    <li> one of the best I Have owned. very sharp.</li>
    <li> New to beards at 40 years old and love this great quality product.  It makes trimming my beard (which I keep short and trim) super easy and consistent.  Easy to clean too.  Feels really solid and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer with amazing battery-life. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for weeks without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to adjust.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good. Stays charged for a long period of time before it needs recharging. Owned a similar older model before, and it just wore out from all the use. Bought the new upgraded model and I am quite happy. Charges fast too. My wife even trims my hair with it.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. I basically never have to charge it. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I use this to maintain my beard length and mustache lining. It&#x27;s a great product. The sizes are good. I use a about a seven. If your beard is a couple inches thick, get the better version. Otherwise get this. Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I love the ease in changing length.  No need for attachments.</li>
    <li> It has a great battery. i charged it the day i received it and didn&#x27;t have to charge it again for more than 3 months. I use it about 1-2 times per week,&lt;br /&gt;However, the blades are a little rough on the skin when used without the comb. Otherwise, it is very hassle free.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews here and elsewhere, I had higher expectations of it. It works okay, and I like the titanium blades and the overall design. But in terms of performance, it cuts rather irregular and is hard to control if you want to keep you beard a bit longer. It seems to work best in the 1-5 mm range but gets messy in the 6-10 mm range.</li>
    <li> fast charge, charge lasts long.  good value</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
    <li> Too soon to give a comprehensive review, but I like it for the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it. After receiving it, I charged for one hour (as recommended in the manual). I only trim my short beard once a week, but I have yet to exhaust the battery to the point of needing a recharge. Will update my review in a few months.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has all the features that I need and none that I don&#x27;t.  Trims the beard very well, small maneuverable and easy to handle, quick to charge, low maintenance (no oil), works with or without the cord, easy to clean, comfortable comb on the skin, length settings from stubble to 10 mm.  Good value.</li>
    <li> If you want a beard trimmer,you can stop looking.  I just received this next day Saturday delivery.  I have had my beard for years and have 3 trimmers sitting in a drawer.  My last trimmer, whal,  comb malfunctioned and mess up my beard so I went for this.  Ordered it over night saturday delivery so I could correct my beard - was here the next day!  Here comes the bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;1.  this trimmer is faster.  the bladed move faster.  it just gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;2.  my hair does not get stuck on the blades making it so i have to clear it out every 30  seconds.&lt;br /&gt;3.  the length setting is very fine grained and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;4.  the comb is not as thick as others.&lt;br /&gt;5.  this was able to trim areas that my other trimmer would require multiple swipes with one swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is the best trimmer i have ever owned.  I don&#x27;t care it charges in an hour.  I dont want a bunch of attachments, charging stands, just a effective grooming trimmer.  I just recommend this product.  If there is a better one let me know, otherwise I&#x27;m sticking with this design. Wish I found this earlier.</li>
    <li> Works good. It&#x27;s nice having all the length settings, and very easy to adjust.</li>
    <li> I used my Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 3500 for the first time this weekend. The trimmer did a great job. There was plenty of battery power remaining after use and easy to open the blade and clean. In this price range it is an excellent purchase. I highly recommend the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer.</li>
    <li> Superb quality; comb &amp; lock wheel work great; no-oil mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with a stand; battery is not lithium-ion.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer and it has excellent battery life.</li>
    <li> Cuts well but very messy</li>
    <li> This thing turn on by itself and was not turning off, so i had to let it run untill the battery died, and I have recharged it again, so far its okey .. but it does feel like it might die soon. Also , I like a close shave, with this you can never get that .</li>
    <li> This is the first stubble-trimmer I&#x27;ve owned and it does a pretty good job. I have nothing to compare it with. I like the fact that it can be charged on a 220V outlet and so I can carry it around when I travel.</li>
    <li> For the price this thing is hard to beat.  It is the 1st beard trimmer I have ever bought with absolutely nothing to complain about.  The main reason I bought it was because it trims at 0.5mm which is hard to find.  Works perfect if you are guy like me who likes to sport a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.  Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Product is fine but this isn&#x27;t what I was looking. If you can let me know if there is any posiblity of returning I will return this</li>
    <li> im not crazy about the design on the the trimming plastic thingy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad about it so I&#x27;m sure he likes it.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller and lighter than my old Norelco which this is replacing. Had that one for 16 years and the comb broke. Couldn&#x27;t find the replacement part, so ordered this. Have only been using it a few weeks but so far am very happy with it. Also ordered the replacement comb from Norelco just in case. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Adjustments for the length of cut are easy and at your finger tips and yes they lock (click) into place so it won&#x27;t jump to another setting while you&#x27;re using it. Clean up is a breeze. Haven&#x27;t run the cutting blades under water yet like you can, I just use my  trusty old shaving brush. Also like the idea that you don&#x27;t have to lubricate it. My old one I would use 1 drop of oil after each use. Maybe that&#x27;s why it lasted 16 years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will up-date this post if I discover any negatives. Would recommend this for anyone looking for a straight forward trimmer without all the fancy attachments. Seems like that&#x27;s what leads to most issues anyways.</li>
    <li> awesome little shaver. has a great guard, no nicks. charges very fast. A single charge will last for weeks while not being used.</li>
    <li> My husband is so much more kissable now, and he does his own.  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> My original unit failed.  My warranty experience was okay and they sent me a replacement.  But then the replacement unit failed on first try.  Fully charged, but will not turn on.  It appears to be a short in the switch.  Warranty experience on replacement unit is okay.  I&#x27;m awaiting the third unit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two month, I use it to bald my head and trim my beard. It does both very well, I purchase this to replace a much louder Remington trimmer that went belly up after only two months. It holds well in the hand and the controls seem robust. My son took over part ownership in difference to his trimmer. I know what to get him for Christmas now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend this product? Why yes I do but remember I only had this for about two months bit am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Works great and not breaking the bank!</li>
    <li> happy with the purchase as a first time user for a trimmer..</li>
    <li> Bought this for my step dad. Seems to be pleased :)  update:since step dad loved it, bought one for me self also.</li>
    <li> I like the feature of being able to use it while it is charging as my last Norelco (which I loved) did not allow that. My one issue is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close as I would like. I keep a constant &amp;#34;5&#x27;o-clock shadow&amp;#34; as I hate to shave but this seems to leave it a little longer than my previous one. I also like the rotating feature for height adjustment as it seems sturdier than the old one. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is terrible. It takes dozens of passes to get a part of your beard evenly cut. The guide head is wobbly and imprecise, wobbling far more than the .5 millimeter that divides the length settings. I ended up bloody trying to trim on the shortest setting because the trimmer heads snag on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not sending this back for the money back guarantee is that it isn&#x27;t worth the cost of shopping it to Norelco and the hassle of mailing it.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to use about once every 3-4 days to keep my beard at a short length. After about a year and a half of normal usage, the trimmer constantly jams and has recently gotten to the point where it jams every 5-10 seconds, making it unusable. I have to keep removing the head and placing it back on. I&#x27;ve even tried lubricating it to no avail. DO NOT get this trimmer if you plan to use it for more than a year or so. Get one that is waterproof and can be washed so you can just run it under the water after each use. I&#x27;ve kept this trimmer clean after each use to the best of my ability but obviously it has still failed.</li>
    <li> The guard covers not only the top of the razor, but the front as well. That makes it somewhat difficult for the beard hair to actually reach the trimming part itself. Because of this, on longer settings (8-10), my beard hair is pushed against my cheek rather than trimmed to the appropriate length.</li>
    <li> Works well...plenty of length settings....very happy with it so far</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend since his completely died.  Good reviews and he seems to like it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great. Been getting great trims and after about a month of daily use I still have not had to recharge it.</li>
    <li> My old beard trimmer was a Andis T Outliner. As such, I&#x27;m used to a very close shave and I primarily use it to shape up my beard. I&#x27;ve had this thing a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like:&lt;br /&gt;-very compact&lt;br /&gt;-ergonomic design makes it easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;-moderately precise when sued to &amp;#34;shape up&amp;#34; a beard&lt;br /&gt;-relatively inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-rounded teeth make it easier (though not foolproof) to avoid nicking yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it ALWAYS LEAVES STUBBLE, even on the lowest setting. If you&#x27;re okay with stubble, this is a great buy. But if you need that fresh from the shop smoothness, get something else.</li>
    <li> I never really kept up with my beard before buying this...like I would grow one and then shave it off a month or so later when it got too unruly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what made me change?  My then girlfriend/now fiancee loves facial hair.  So I decided its time to drop some cash into making sure my beard looked manly and awesome by getting this trimmer.  I like how it has a bunch of different settings for all occasions - low for stubble beard and higher ones for fuller, thicker beards.  I&#x27;ve had a beard for months now and this helps me keep on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started going for a longer, fuller beard.  Definitely look into getting some beard oil if you have coarse hair (like me) to soften and groom it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the next time I buy a beard related item,&lt;br /&gt;beard on my friends, beard on.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as it says it does, so not the right shaver for shaping beards.  I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I settled on this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I do not grow long beards.  I like anything between a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow up to a week of growth, then I usually trim it back down to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not for close shaves.  If you want a close shave for cheap, go with Dollar Shave Club and line up your beard with those.  However, this will give you a nice, even trim, quickly and smoothly.  This also works well for the nether region, as the guard glides along, without snagging or pulling.  The guard comes off for an easy clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My trimmer came with a charge right out of the box.  I&#x27;ve used it twice now without plugging it in.  So far, I am very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great, precise, no problems - I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this trimmer, but alas it was a disappointment. I had a pretty full beard and I wanted to trim down for summer, so I purchased this trimmer. When using it I set the dial to 10 which is the biggest size. As I ran the trimmer through my beard the clip would just press the hairs down instead of acting as a comb to bring them into the cutting head. I tried running against the grain, perpendicular to the grain and nothing worked. I had to go over the same spot 5-10 times to get most of the hair trimmed. I think the problem is the that teeth on the clip are not pointed so as to act like a comb and grab the hairs to guide them into the cutting head, so the trimmer just rides over the hairs. The trimmer does have a strong motor, and the trimmer works well without the clip when shaping the beard. However, the bad design of the clip, makes this unit unusable for anyone with a beard longer than just a stubble.</li>
    <li> Very good 👍, no issues</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancé, and it works great!  I probably should&#x27;ve got the one with the vacuum that doesn&#x27;t make a mess, but all well.  So far this one has kept it&#x27;s charge from being plugged in once (used about once or twice a week for quick trims), and it works really well to even out his beard.  He keeps on a medium length and it works well there.  He hasn&#x27;t tried it at the lowest level for stubble, but with how he&#x27;s used it this far it works really well!</li>
    <li> Decent power and good price but it&#x27;s pretty brutal on your skin without the guard on...would not recommend if you plan on trimming your nether regions as well.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great for beard trimming and is easily adjusted to the length you want.  Easy to clean.  Good price compared to similar offerings.  Have only owned for about a month but its everything I ever dreamed of in the wide world of beard trimming</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping it would make it easy to trim my mustache.  The results were as good as I had hoped for.  The adjustments are precise.  The guide is easy to remove for cleaning but stays firmly attached during use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to watch this over time and see if it works this well for years.  But it won me over immediately with its ease of use compared to the stubble-vacuum version (T980 or something?) that I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star off was for the fact that stubble does go everywhere.  I have to stay close to the sink if I want cleanup to be easy.  Also I feel they probably could have made it a little quieter if they tried.  I would have paid $20 more for a quieter version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the 4 stars positive is for ease of use, easy handling (no awkward angles), nothing you have to be extra careful about.  It&#x27;s also easy to clean.  It arrived already charged and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet after a week of use so I&#x27;m pretty happy about the battery life too.  Adjustability is in nice fine increments.  Other reviewers said it&#x27;s not the #1 choice if you want to choose how many tenths of a millimeter for the perfect shadow/stubble, but I use it just between stubble and very-short-beard and it has plenty of settings right around what I want.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace a similar-looking Remington trimmer that had died and bought another Remington. Big mistake!!! Sure, it&#x27;s inexpensive, but it&#x27;s a lousy design and pulled the hairs my beard with the terrible &#x27;rake&#x27; tool rather than cut them! Sent that one back and put more $ in the game to buy this Norelco. It&#x27;s great! Small, light, good shape, and cuts like butter. Just glides over my beard like a trimmer should do. Highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Does not get down to a one or two day stubble on the lowest setting. Even taking off the guard doesn&#x27;t do much either. Highly disappointed</li>
    <li> Super Trimmer and worth for money</li>
    <li> It is smaller than what I thought!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using it every few days!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer if you like to keep some facial hair but want more of the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. Thanks!</li>
    <li> One of the best I have ever owned. Only ish that it had a completely secure/still clipper because sometimes pressing the unit hard makes the clipper move. But worth the money. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible! The item is called a beard trimmer and yet it clogged every single pass on a short beard (the length just long enough to say &#x27;beard&#x27; rather than &#x27;stubble&#x27;). Costco has a (corded) set for $25 that has been a fantastic replacement for this disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 1 month, and it decently what it is suppose to do. I do regret it can&#x27;t shave beard length beyond 10 mm, but it seems to be a standard feature for this kind of devices.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer for managing my stubble.  It&#x27;s not as loud as my previous trimmer, so thats a plus.</li>
    <li> Use it daily, I use it to shave, it does a pretty close Don Jonson shave!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. Iam highly disappointed</li>
    <li> Small, compact and easy to use. The blade cuts cleanly. The adjustable cutting height settings are great. Now, let me just see how long it&#x27;ll last. Overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> great product, my husband loves it!!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, easy to clean up my beard and mustache, charges quickly and runs incredibly fast, easy cleanup as well.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY beard trimmer I have found that gives me control over the length of my stubble. Most trimmers have a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; setting that is way longer than what I want, and the next shorter length would be bare blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine is awesome... you can select length in very tiny increments, I think it&#x27;s millimeters, or close to. Very precise control. Shaves smoothly without pulling. Charges quickly and the charge lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con.. the blade guard feels a little flimsy; however it has not broken so as long as it stays in one piece it&#x27;s not a big deal to me.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well. But it doesn&#x27;t have a setting for close cut. It seems to have a decent battery life.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is perfect especially if you prefer a stubble. The only suggestion I have is to make sure you have a good after shave because if you have very delicate skin like me your skin gets extremely irritated.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Trims very nicely.  Like the setting dial.</li>
    <li> This is too expensive. I returned few trimmers which I bought from Amazon. I felt like they were not worth and not maintaining the quality of the brand and also too rough while trimming. And the product which I bought now doesn&#x27;t look better than those two trimmers which I returned earlier. Now, I am bored of returning the products.I want to return this too but I am in dilemma whether returning it or not because the package was torn. Even though it was torn I decided to send it back now. I am looking for the good trimmer where I can trim my beard and sometimes hair too. Please  suggest me the best suitable trimmer.Cost doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> Now I have to shave. Thanks a bunch.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks bad . It&#x27;ll put holes in your beard doesn&#x27;t cut evenly!!!!</li>
    <li> I have course/thick/curly beard hair and that makes it hard to find a good trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does a great job! The length guide is great and it&#x27;s not hard to get an even trim, which is hard to say about the other half dozen beard trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually give this 4.5 stars because it is rechargeable and I prefer the kinds that take batteries (I always lose the chargers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> The power is great. The charge time is short. The precision is great. Biggest complaint I have with product is that it doesn&#x27;t have enough &#x27;short&#x27; hair/stubble settings. That is, it has 20 settings, but I only find myself using setting 1 (the very shortest setting), when I almost wish I could trim my facial hair a mm or two shorter. It&#x27;s a nitpicky detail for sure, but I like really short stubble, so I can only use setting 1 with the black cover attachment removed.  Great product if you don&#x27;t care about having multiple, super short stubble settings.</li>
    <li> My BF loves this beard trimmer.  It grooms his beard very well and there are so many settings.  Got it at a great price during Amazon&#x27;s Deal of the Day.  So happy with this purchase.  It does make a mess though, so ladies be sure your man cleans up after himself!</li>
    <li> Works great. Just as advertised. Wish it had a stand though..</li>
    <li> With promotional coupon and free shipping, I got this for $30 and it seems to do the job.  It has a strong running speed and trims my mustache and goatee well.  I keep these both fairly short and I have the setting all the way to the lowest (closest shave), and that&#x27;s perfect for me.  These may be a problem if I want to have a weekend stubble look beyond the goatee and mustache though since I&#x27;ll need to have that stubble even shorter and not quite sure how to accomplish that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slight negative is the plastic guard (the piece that moves up and down when you select the length of the trim you want). It may be common sense, but if you&#x27;re not very careful to use the consistent pressure on your face when trimming, the guard won&#x27;t really matter much and you may find yourself trimming off more than you wanted.</li>
    <li> Very adjustable, could have more oomph as it can bog down but otherwise it trims as it should.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that this product eventually did what it was supposed to do, which is the reasoning for 2 stars instead of 1.&lt;br /&gt;The length settings are good for getting the exact amount of facial hair one may be looking for. But before one gets excited by high expectations, they should know the negatives first. For one, most of the hair that was shaved off, stuck to my face. It was a pain to have to take a good 90 seconds every time to completely splash and rub all of the hairs stuck to my face to see what was properly shaven and what wasn&#x27;t. And that leads to my next issue-- how this item properly shaves. Well, it doesn&#x27;t actually. After I assumed I had gotten everything, I noticed that this razor left patches along my neck. One could argue that it was my own negligence that caused me to miss spots. But I instantly thought of such a thing, and proved my point, when I had to go over the patches several times to get them shaven. It doesn&#x27;t help that it&#x27;s not 100% clear at what exact angle you&#x27;re supposed to be shaving with. Finding the sweet spot with how much you need to tilt the razor to angle it correctly and get it to properly shave is hysterically comical at best, and frustrating at worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this all leads to my last point-- the time it took. With normal, trusty disposable razors, I would have to deal with my face being naked maybe 2-3 days before my stubble comes back. For those desiring longer &#x27;beards&#x27;, I cannot review this product properly for you. I just desire rough/heavy stubble. So shaving my face clean with a disposable razor doesn&#x27;t matter much when my desired look doesn&#x27;t take long to grow back anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I could deal with having a naked face for only a couple days, (let&#x27;s say a weekend) have it only take 5 minutes max, and be a heck of a lot less trouble and frustrating. Or I could continue with this product and have to deal with an annoying experience that takes around 20 minutes. I&#x27;m a busy gentleman. I&#x27;ll go with the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros --&lt;br /&gt;+&#x27;Feels&#x27; cool to use.&lt;br /&gt;+Length setting is something you can&#x27;t get with disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;+Clean up of the razor itself is simple and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons --&lt;br /&gt;-Hairs get stuck to face.&lt;br /&gt;-Must go over patches several times.&lt;br /&gt;-Not clear at what angle you&#x27;re supposed to point the the item.&lt;br /&gt;-Takes a long time to get what is desired.&lt;br /&gt;-Clean up of hairs getting everywhere is frustrating.</li>
    <li> This is a great stubble trimmer. I had lost my old Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer a few years ago. I replaced it with a much more expensive Norelco model and it never worked as good as my QT4021. I spent a couple years frustrated before I decided to try this one based on reviews. I&#x27;m glad I did. This model works very similar to way the QT4021 did. I wouldn&#x27;t say its better than the QT4021, but I&#x27;m not longer frustrated.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product. It actually gets the job done pretty well.</li>
    <li> First, some back story: I have stubble that grows pretty thick and very fast. My five o&#x27;clock shadow shows up at about 1 pm. I could never get my face to stay smooth shaven for very long. But then I didn&#x27;t shave for a couple of days and I got quite a few compliments on my &amp;#34;new look&amp;#34;. So I started searching for a trimmer I could use to maintain my stubble length. I came across this one and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, the box was pretty easy to open. I didn&#x27;t even need scissors. The charger isn&#x27;t very bulky and can be easily packed in a toiletry bag when traveling. I received this on 29 June and plugged it in overnight to charge. It is now 21 August and I still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet. I use it mostly everyday, but sometimes that stretches out to every other day depending on the circumstances for that day. I wouldn&#x27;t consider it very loud, but it isn&#x27;t quiet either. I&#x27;d say it falls in the middle. It isn&#x27;t noticeable too unless you&#x27;re in the same room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend growing out your stubble for a few days, then start using this trimmer on the highest setting and work your way down to whatever length you like. With the fine adjustment for length, you should be able to find an option that strikes your fancy. You can even take off the guard and use the bare blades on your skin. I don&#x27;t feel any discomfort when I do this to touch up the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic battery life&lt;br /&gt;Many options for stubble length&lt;br /&gt;Can be used while charging&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean the components&lt;br /&gt;Self sharpening blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Stubble tends to fly everywhere (I recommend standing in the bathtub to catch all the stray pieces of hair)</li>
    <li> works great so far, very powerful, convenient to adjust and clean, and has held its charge very well so far. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced trimmer.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve dreaded trimming my beard because it was tedious and uncomfortable. With my last two trimmers, I&#x27;d have to go over the same spot multiple times to get close to an even shave. This caused my skin to become super irritated and would make a relatively simple process take ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my old Wahl beard trimmer&#x27;s last failure (scalping the hair along my jaw line), I tossed it in the trash and started looking for a new trimmer. I was so impressed by the reviews of the Norelco QT4014 that I ordered it immediately and it arrived the next day. It worked right out of the package and looks sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it this morning to clean up my choppy beard and it worked like a charm. The motor runs quiet, I got a fast and even shave in one pass through, it felt smooth on my face, and clean up was easy. I simply took off the guard to get most of the hair out and then ran the guard under water to clean it the rest of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the Norelco to anyone looking for a great beard trimmer without dropping a lot of cash.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;Good battery. I bought the trimmer a few weeks ago. So far I did not have to recharge it despite frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve found.  The beard length guide does a great job of staying put so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any accidental slippage.</li>
    <li> Got two (one for my son and the other for myself) and got the same problem with both. Both Batteries died with a few days...</li>
    <li> The trimmer has good power, cuts well, is light weight and is adjustable but it is not as easy to manuever around as a trimmer with a smaller head, or one with exchangable heads like the one that I used to have that finally died.  The charge lasts a really long time and it only takes an hour to fully charge.  Worth 4 stars.</li>
    <li> 4 months of use on the original charge.  Love all the depth settings. Would definitely buy and recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Broke after 1 charge orange light keeps flashing but wnt charge</li>
    <li> nice product...fast delivery</li>
    <li> Good product, but struggles some on my thick beard.</li>
    <li> Finally found a trimmer that allows me to wear a clean permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Great product,</li>
    <li> Husband loves it!  And he&#x27;s very picky.</li>
    <li> Its a great trimmer all around. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but this product really has done a great job. I&#x27;ve used it for body and beard trimming and its precise and clean cut every time. The easy to use adjustment knob never goes out of place unless you turn the dial. Its very easy to clean, quiet and has a long lasting battery which is great for my work travel when I can be on the road for up to 4-5 days at a time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer for the price.  I think that this must be true for most beard trimmers, but note that beard stubble will be scattered around when you use this trimmer, but this is an easy clean-up.  The multiple length setting feature is really convenient and easy to set.  Would definitely recommend this beard trimmer for those needing the basics.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying this trimmer since some of the reviews were negative. Fortunately, the trimmer is great and works with my thick facial hair. Would recommend to anybody looking for a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> Wanted an affordable and cordless trimmer that made it easy to get exact lengths. This trimmer is a little loud but otherwise has decent battery life (option to use it plugged or cordless) and my favorite feature is the super easy &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; option to select the length of trim I want. This has settings low enough for even the shabbiest of beards, so no worry if you just want to trim up some stubble. This was made with stubble in mind and it delivers. Very lightweight. Also really nice that when you take the guard off for a clean shave, the blades don&#x27;t dig in.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace a Wahl trimmer whose battery had finally given out. I love the rounded tips on the blade guard, which is good as that was a deciding factor in this purchase. They come with a downside though. This trimmer doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as my old Wahl. That said, I could be a bit hasty with this trimmer and not worry about any catching or pulling, which is nice. Considering the options, I&#x27;ve made this my new body trimmer and it&#x27;s working out well for that.</li>
    <li> i bought this as an upgrade from a Norelco Bodygroom, which uses snap-on guards to trim at different lengths. While I still use the Bodygroom for (duh) body grooming, this trimmer is vastly better for precision facial hair trimming. I love the adjustability, ease of use and compact size, which helps it work well around the jawline and ears. It&#x27;s also easy to clean, which is a huge plus. Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Affordable and does the job.</li>
    <li> Reading the other reviews I was leery about this one, however I was pleasantly surprised.  The motor is strong.  The stable length is easy to use and cut much better than I thought.  The razor this replaced took 5-10 minutes to cut my beard and hair, this one took maybe 3-5 minutes.  The one big issue I have is the softer hair on my chest was near impossible to cut, even taking off the adjustable length devise.  All in all great for face, not so great body.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  This is a very small trimmer but the battery lasts a very long time.  I use this daily, works great.</li>
    <li> The trim guide flexes very easily even at the shortest settings. Its almost toyish and gimmicky how flimsy it is.   Plus, It doesn&#x27;t cut very well, even compared to a popular $15 Wahl aa battery powered trimmer here on amazon  I don&#x27;t understand all the rave reviews. I&#x27;m going back to the cheap battery powered trimmer that cuts much better    I would return it, but I don&#x27;t have the original packaging.</li>
    <li> Battery works well, cutter trims well.  I like all of the height adjustments, but I&#x27;m not sure how durable taking the black trim length setter on an off will last.  Sometimes I take the guard off, so I can trim neck hair or sideburns.  Doesn&#x27;t seem real durable.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Simple and efficient.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my side burns, which get a bit unruly if I go too long between haircuts. The blade is sharp; it cuts, never pulls. It&#x27;s easy to clean, which is important to me, too.  It came charged, which surprised me. I don&#x27;t have to use it too often, so I still haven&#x27;t had to charge it. It&#x27;s very easy to adjust and has 10 or 11 setting levels; I set mine at 7 and pretty much forget it.  It&#x27;s fairly sturdy for a home-use appliance. The adjustable blade guard, what is referred to as the &amp;#34;trimmer comb&amp;#34; in the instruction booklet, seems to be a bit fragile; if you drop the trimmer on a tile floor, the guard will most likely break. It may break even if you drop the trimmer on a carpeted floor. I don&#x27;t know if Philips Norelco sells a replacement for one. The included instruction booklet doesn&#x27;t explicitly mention replacement parts, although it does mention something about replacement blades, so I think the company does sell some replacement parts for the device. They&#x27;re not mentioned in the instruction booklet, though.  The trimmer comes packaged with a fairly thorough instruction booklet written in English and Spanish, a storage pouch and a cleaning brush.  The flimsy blade guard is my only complaint with the product. For me, it&#x27;s not enough for me to ding the product a full star. Bottom line, it works. I thought it was a good deal and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmers, does a good job.</li>
    <li> Works great.  When my razor blades started ripping my facial hair out, I started growing stubble in protest.  A beard itches too much, so I needed to keep it trim.  This got great reviews and was low(ish) in cost.  I wanted to spend enough so the product was actually good enough that I didn&#x27;t need to replace it in 2 weeks.  I think this was $30, and totally worth it.  The dial adjustment is super simple and once you find the length you want, presto.  I also could use it on my eyebrows, which unfortunately can get a little wily at times, so bonus use.  What&#x27;s impressed me most so far is that I charged it fully when I got this over a month ago, I use it twice a week and I have not yet had to recharge it.  So it holds a charge excellently, which is super nice.  I don&#x27;t like clutter, so this keeps me from having to have a charging trimmer on my counter all the time.  Good stuff.  Of course it trims evenly.  That&#x27;s kind of the point of it, so I glazed over that fact.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure before buying if worth the investment, but it&#x27;s a massive upgrade from my cheap trimmer and I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;d known the difference was so obvious I would have gone straight to this one instead of cycling through a couple of cheap ones first.</li>
    <li> This was EXACTLY  what I wanted.  Set the length desired and roll with it.  Precise, and easy.  I just use it every other day.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Easy to use and clean. A ton of length settings. Battery lasts forever on a full charge. The initial charge lasted about 4 months with every other day - every day use. I have had it about 6 months now and it is working great so far.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have ever used</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Excellent trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and have been less than satisfied with the product. I&#x27;m not sure if the product is defective, but it doesn&#x27;t cut evenly and I find myself spending 15 minutes just trying to even out my trim.</li>
    <li> The cutter is clinging my hair and this is painful, also, the result of the shaving is mediocre,  I have to make a few passes to get the result, my($12) 7 years old corded Wahl does better work</li>
    <li> The comb is a bit complicated to use, I don&#x27;t know which side to use to get the length I want. I messed it up the first time I used it and had to shave the whole beard just bcuz of the wrong size. But performance wise and the machine itself is great! Great charging time and battery life too.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Powerful motor, smooth trim, and I like the extra groomer on the back.</li>
    <li> I also bought this for my brother for Christmas.  He also felt that it was &amp;#34;pretty sweet&amp;#34; so again, five stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this for 35$ when my husband&#x27;s beard trimmer broke. He&#x27;s happy with it, so I am too. I can honestly say I would of went for a cheaper one had I seen the price now (55$) and even though it&#x27;s a good beard trimmer, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 55$ good and if it were to break today I&#x27;d go and buy a 20-30$ one.  Edit: they changed the price back to 35$ so I do recommend this trimmer. :)</li>
    <li> It works well.  A battery charge lasts a long time.  The on/off switch does not seem natural.  I think the ergonomics of the switch could have been better.  That is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> Great little tool to keep your beard looking great it has many settings the charge last long time</li>
    <li> breaks after 2 month of using</li>
    <li> These clippers do not cut as close as my old Wahls. The guard also traps hair and needs to be emptied often if trimming down a longer beard.</li>
    <li> Really great product. It does the job perfect.</li>
    <li> The head of the trimmer curves very far back essentially forcing you to use it up side down, which also makes it very difficult to use on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb positions lock nicely but do not actually catch hair very well.  It takes multiple passes to get a clean cut and it seems like it never evens out.  Also the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; feature just means that the blades are exposed providing the same effect as taking the guard completely off, and it does not seem to be able to reach the 0.5 mm Norelco claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only benefit to this trimmer is the charge time and battery life.  Otherwise I will probably switch back to Remington for a more thoughtful design.</li>
    <li> This works alright, about what you&#x27;d expect from a cheap trimmer. Sometimes I use it without the adjustable portion for precision lines and areas, and that is fairly effective as well. I usually keep it on the lowest setting because it is really easy to accidentally bump it down. Works great when you&#x27;re traveling since the battery lasts forever! I&#x27;ve done about 5 full beard trims and still going strong on one charge now.</li>
    <li> its a good thing I bought from Amazon this time, it&#x27;s body is slim and has many different hairs length options to meet my different requires. Would buy next time for other things.</li>
    <li> It has a built in length guide that is great for eye brows, side burns, and beards</li>
    <li> It works well and charges so fast, it probably took about 30 minutes from the blinking power light to fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the trim changes very easy with a twisting motion. My only issues is that it seems I need multiple passes to get a trim and my beard is not that thick to begin with.</li>
    <li> Using the stubble setting primarily I&#x27;ve been very pleased. I would like a lower/closer setting, but I do a couple of passes and it seems to work well. Rarely need to charge it as the charge lasts weeks the way I use it. Only downside is the very efficient blades tend to turn trimmed hair into powder so I lean in over my sink to catch most of it.</li>
    <li> Have used it once so far.  It seems to be doing the job but the only thing I would have preferred is that the comb teeth were closer together.  My beard lays real close to my face and more teeth would help lift it up better I think.  Also I looked all through the box for the beard comb and couldn&#x27;t find it only to realize the comb is what fits on the blades.  It&#x27;s not an actual comb.  Other than that, I&#x27;m glad I got it and plan on using it regularly.</li>
    <li> My husband has lost the use of his left hand and this trimmer with the dial down comb feature takes the difficulty of changing combs out of the equation.  Does a great job!  Note: If using for beard trimming start on a longer setting if the beard is thick to prevent snagging.  Go over the entire beard then dial it down to the desired setting.  We experimented a bit and his beard is very thick so we did long trim, medium trim and final trim to keep it comfortable for him</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about four months and use it less than once a week. It suddenly stopped working. We tried plugging it in the charge but it was already charged. The trimming piece won&#x27;t move back and forth. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> why did I spend so many years trimming with scissors?</li>
    <li> It works exactly as you expect. The guard is a bit too easily filled with hair, but it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Shopped around for the right one finally picked the right one The product is a good trimmer holds charge for a good while</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for</li>
    <li> This sounds weird, but I couldn&#x27;t even figure out which direction I was supposed to shave with it... An awkwardly shaped, curved, flimsy plastic attachment was scary to use, hard to approach, and difficult to imagine keeping it consistent enough to get an even shave. Where am I supposed to apply pressure on the head?!  I tried using it for stubble, but I could see how people who try to trim longer hair could have a patchy experience. Also, it can&#x27;t be used under water?! So no using in the shower and no rinsing in the sink, apparently.  The body of the unit, as soon as I picked it up,  felt very cheap.  I got it to replace my dulling Norelco, but now I&#x27;d rather just keep it and do a few more passes.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaving unit that I use for small trims, typically. The battery life is exceptional, and I have never had it pull out hair. It also works well for haircuts, and the included adjustable guide is handy.</li>
    <li> Does a good job trimming my beard.  Just know that it&#x27;s not gonna COMPLETELY SHAVE OFF a beard  Of course, it says it&#x27;s a trimmer in the title.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and great long lasting battery...I charge it every month or so since it keeps working very well after 6-8 shaves.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer ive had in years...</li>
    <li> I love shaving with this thing. Never would&#x27;ve expected a $40 beard trimmer to cut so well. All the size options are amazing.</li>
    <li> small convenient. runs on battery and also when connected.  battery lasts quite a bit.  at least 3 days for me.  easy to clean and adjust.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  It gives me the neat short trim i like.  I really like how easy it is to remove the depth guard.</li>
    <li> R. McAdams&#x27; video review notes that the shape of this trimmer (with its head bent away at a weird angle) makes it awkward to handle.  In my case, it renders the thing nearly unusable.  Maybe I&#x27;m clumsier than the other reviewers, or my guard is defective, but it&#x27;s easy to accidentally point the trimmer at my face in a way that brings the blade much closer than I have it set for.  Inevitably I end up with a trim that&#x27;s patchy and/or shorter than I&#x27;d planned.  I ditched this and got a Panasonic ER224S, which I&#x27;ll wait a while to review, but which has a sturdy guard that locks in place and gives me an even trim no matter how I push it around my fat face &amp; head.</li>
    <li> Cuts smoothly but very flimsy/uneven guard.</li>
    <li> I did not like it. I expected little better for the price. The settings are confusing. Does not do well for short beard.</li>
    <li> It says &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; trimmer but It works good for something else *hint hint*..... I&#x27;m talking about my nuts if you&#x27;re wondering</li>
    <li> So far so good, works well. Had a Remington with a lithium battery. It died after 2 months</li>
    <li> I think some people are just unsatisfied by the attachment if they use them a lot . Frankly ,we never use any attachment often . This works just fine for me . Great Product.</li>
    <li> Works great and gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Its not a bad shaver, but its not very accurate. The guide seems to have some flex, which causes it to be inaccurate.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, frankly, maybe because my beard is not completely straight, but it does not trim evenly, it still looks a bit like I have not shaved without really trimming my beard...so not very happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Trimmer because of the Reviews.&lt;br /&gt;So that´s why I decided to write a review myself.&lt;br /&gt;The one I had before was a Wahl 9918-6171, which I had to oil every now and then, and the battery life was not good.&lt;br /&gt;Now talking about the Philips Norelco QT4014/42. This one does not need to be oiled and the battery life so far is exceeding my expectations. I charged it as soon as I got it and still is working nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Does not pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it continues as it is!!!</li>
    <li> It was working great . thought I found a nice trimmer finally. After two months and couple of recharges it stopped working suddenly this morning. changed the power settings, power on/off no use. there was no power surge at home. very disappointing indeed.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how this item has received so many high-star ratings!  Maybe if the only thing you are using this for is to trim your head or if you have a big scruffy beard, then perhaps it might be useful and that&#x27;s the only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 0 (or 1 the minimum allowed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing, I bought this trimmer to use as a body &amp;#34;man-scaping&amp;#34; trimmer.  DO NOT, under any circumstances, use this product for that!  Especially down there!  The problem lies in the design of the &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34;.  It attaches to the unit on the back of the device, opposite side of the cutting edge.  So the part that covers the cutting edge is essentially floating in the air above the cutters.  Simple Physics 101 dictates then that ANY amount of pressure applied at the tip (where the razors are) is going to cause the guide to pivot at the back where it is attached.  Imagine you stand up straight and hold one arm out at a 90 degree angle to you.  If someone pushes downwards on your shoulder, your hand isn&#x27;t going to move, but the slightest amount of pressure applied downwards on your fingertips, will cause your hand to move downwards as well while your shoulder (the fulcrum) will remain fixed.  What does all this mean?!  Well, with the dial on this thing turned to 3 or 3.5 or lower, the guide is pretty much useless because the guide tip will duck down when slightly pressed against your skin to the same level as the cutting razor!  I learned that the VERY hard way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, the flat end of the guide, which is the part placed against the surface of your skin, is very thick, i.e., there&#x27;s a ton of surface area.  Placing all this surface area against your skin causes alot of friction.  This results in the razor not moving in the direction you intend, so naturally, you apply a bit more pressure to get it to move and before you know it, you&#x27;ve applied too much and, well, see problem 1 above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving credit forthe fact that the idea of not having to have all the little different sized guides lying around is phenomenal.  But the execution of that idea for this device was an epic fail!  Again, if you&#x27;re just trimming back a massive amount of head hair or beard, then this thing might work OK even though I don&#x27;t see anyway to get a consistent trim if it is completely dependent on the amount of pressure you apply, but whatever, i&#x27;m trying to give them a little bit of credit.  But for anything else, this product is completely useless!</li>
    <li> Bought so I could shave, job done.</li>
    <li> Happy after the first few weeks...</li>
    <li> Blades are high quality, but the comb does nothing to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the hair from the skin, so unless your hair grows and sticks perpendicular to the skin, this trimmer won&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> Seems to function well, the charge holds really well although I don&#x27;t use it often.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Have not used a razor in months because of this. The battery lasts forever and charges fast. The built in adjustable trim lengths are awesome.  Also, it cuts smoothly and doesn&#x27;t pull. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I travel overseas quite a bit, making weight and size extremely important to me. With its carrying case and brush, the razor weighs only 5.7 ounces and it is the smallest trimmer on the market. With a 90 minute battery life, there is no need to bring the charger on a month-long trip, even shaving twice a week. Nor is there ever a need to oil the cutter. More important, it does the job quickly and to perfection. I can easily change the length of the cut and I only need to blow on the razor to remove hair.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a couple of months now and it is going strong with a single charge. Used to trim beard to a short length and it gives an even cut without divoting.</li>
    <li> At the lower lengths the guard that guides your hair has a big gap right at the tip of the razor blades. In practice this makes it relatively easy to cut a line in your beard that is far, far shorter than you intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a beard anymore. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend a more traditional Wahl barbershop-style trimmer with plastic clip-ons that control the length of your bead more reliably.</li>
    <li> This trimmer just keeps going and going. I charged it once a few months ago and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use it about once a week for 7 minutes and it works great. It&#x27;s sharp, quiet, and pretty much easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only two drawbacks - the guard that comes with it has an unexplainable opening that runs across the middle of the guard. This opening tends to catch on my skin and seems utterly unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other drawback is the switch - it needs a better grip. Even with dry hands it takes an incredible amount of effort to switch it on or off. I think a little bit of rubber or deeper plastic grooves would go a long way in fixing this design flaw.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and it gives an even trim.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 weeks and so far no problems.</li>
    <li> Very glad I made this purchase. Best Trimmer I&#x27;ve owned (One of only two) but no pulling of hair and it works wonderful for my needs . I use it at a 7 and a half and my beard is quite curly. So I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old Wahl that broke after I dropped it. I keep a beard of 3-4 days&#x27; growth, and much of my beard hair lies very close to the skin or curls back towards it. On the settings I wanted this trimmer had a heck of a time cutting consistently, and I was never able to get a consistent trim all around. It was also difficult, with the trim guard off, to clean up the edges of my beard, again because the trimmer didn&#x27;t seem to be picking up the hairs. The battery does last a long time though and the trimmer seems well-constructed, so it might work for others. Just be wary if you have a beard like mine.</li>
    <li> Top Notch shaver. I even shave my head with it.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it too.&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW CHARGING INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU WANT IT TO PERFORM WELL A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> Previously owned the Philips Norelco QT4000/42 Beard Trimmer for quite some time and really loved it. Despite that fact this time i decided to go for this model for few reasons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wireless. This just beats off everything.&lt;br /&gt;2. Quick charging time. 4000/42 model taken almost 12 hours to charge and runs 20 minutes which this 4014/42 model takes just over an hour and lasts 40-50 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision for this model is 0.5mm which is not really much different than 1mm of 4000/42 model in practical terms. Both trimmers provide equally close results. Both the models have good grip and gives a really good experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i&#x27;d say go for the 4000/42 (cheaper) model if you just want basic. In case you are travelling a lot or want a wireless model, go for this 4014/42 model. Totally worth the price difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to register your product for an increased 2.5 years warranty.</li>
    <li> So far, I love this trimmer. I&#x27;ve charged it once and still holding on original charge after 4 uses. Also, it&#x27;s the easiest trimmer I&#x27;ve had (gone through 3 others), has all different settings which makes it easy to leed the length you need.</li>
    <li> Works great, it&#x27;s everything I needed.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Conair iStubble, which was a good trimmer, but was terribly designed, electrically and mechanically speaking. It stopped working, so I had to look for a new one. That being the case, I bought this trimmer a week or two ago, and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would trim as short as I would like (I used the .4mm setting on the Conair trimmer), but it does the job well. It&#x27;s also no less powerful when not plugged in than it is when plugged in (as far as I can tell), which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Since buying it, I&#x27;ve used it about 15 times and it&#x27;s still running on its first charge from over a month ago!</li>
    <li> Works great as a general trimmer, but not so great if you really want it&#x27;s advertised &#x27;stubble&#x27; function, which leaves you looking a little patchy because the comb design does nothing to lift the whiskers. You end up with some stubble and some beard. Works great from setting 2 on up.</li>
    <li> Underpowered, slow, and incredibly messy. Took twice as long as my previous trimmer, and flung whiskers EVERYwhere. Used it once, and already looking for a (much better) replacement...</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer!  I use it on my beard, neck, and hair (mainly around the ears), and have been asked by several people if I see a professional. That totally sounds like I was paid to say it, but it&#x27;s 100% true. Fo reals!  While this unit is easy to disassemble and clean, I still haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of putting it back together. It&#x27;s not difficult to the point of anger or frustration, but it&#x27;s qwerky enough to require a few attempts. Overall, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I regret the purchase of this item.  I purchased it because I had lost the &amp;#34;Comb&amp;#34; attachment to my old Norelco.  I find this 3500 to be almost useless for my type of beard (curley).</li>
    <li> stopped working after 3 months</li>
    <li> This trimmer was purchased to replace my T-6000 which finally gave out after 10 years or more. Lite weight, excellent charger, (holds a charge forever), you won&#x27;t be sorry you bought it but, its no Norelco T-6000.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the old model its replacing, looks like i need to find a new brand. This thing just doesn&#x27;t cut it</li>
    <li> this is a great product I&#x27;m glad about it I would recommend this product to anybody who likes a good grooming tool</li>
    <li> one hour charging time is nice...</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly what I wanted/needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hunting season, so the beard is grown.  It was looking kind of scruffy as it got longer and the old trimmer wasn&#x27;t cutting it - figuratively and literally.  Christmas gift idea! He says, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s easy to use, has adjustable measurements that seem accurate, it doesn&#x27;t tug or pull.&amp;#34;  And he&#x27;s looking fine!</li>
    <li> This shaver does work, but . . . It is shaped differently than the two Norelco beard trimmers that I have owned previously. I find it&#x27;s backward angling very awkward, and I find that it makes it not trim as well. It is also more difficult to use on awkward spots, like the back of my neck. For anyone replacing an older Norelco, look very closely at the photos, and notice the bend in it. It just feels backwards to me.</li>
    <li> Some folks report problems, but I think one just has to learn how to use this trimmer.  I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Trimmer works ok, takes a few tries to get the length settings right. However, last night at 4am the trimmer turned on on its own, even though it was on OFF mode. I couldn&#x27;t turn it off because the battery is internal, and it literally buzzed all night until the battery died. I can&#x27;t even return it because my return window has passed. Maybe I got a defective item, but i have never seen anything like that happen.</li>
    <li> I had a higher end Norelco beard trimmer with a vacuum for 7 years.  It finally gave up the ghost.  I decided to spring for the more spartan model this time.  I have no complaints thus far.  It does the trick.  It doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum and it feels a bit less substantial, but its still plenty sturdy and the price was great!  It does every bit as well as the last one.</li>
    <li> The guard is a bit flimsy.</li>
    <li> Great, but watch out! It&#x27;s so smooth I accidentally shaved my goatee off 😂</li>
    <li> I purchased as a gift for my son and he very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have tried several beard / mustash trimmers and this is the best.  Easy to use, easy to adjust, has all the settings.  And it is easy to adjust settings.  Other trimmers were cheaply made and difficult to adjust settings.  This one is well made and works great!</li>
    <li> Performed as expected</li>
    <li> This is far superior to my old trimmer that was 7 years old, easy to use, small and higher tech. Can trim very low for the shadow style also, bought two of them, one for home and one for travel.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price</li>
    <li> love it. it trims very close on the 0.5 mm setting, eliminating the need to shave every day. I have a sensitive skin and shaving every day leaves my skin rough and also causes breakouts. this trimmer is the best I have ever owned. A Charge lasts almost more than a week if you trim every day. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used in a couple of decades of trying different models and brands.  Love the range of trim lengths provided, the ease of cleanup and battery life.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Grooming my beard has always been a dreaded task.  The products I&#x27;ve used in the past always had guides that would slip and cause me to take a chunk out of my beard.  This guide adjust easier and stays in place...I always get the same results now.  The best feature is that the guide comes off so you can easily trim around the mouth and shape the sides.</li>
    <li> This thing is so inconsistent in cutting my beard.  It cuts very coarse beard hairs well, but soft beard hairs are completely missed.  I have to use different settings for the same length beard.  Leaves my beard completely uneven.  Will probably trash it and get another.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer. I like the adjustments, not too noisy. I use it daily and it&#x27;s help up well, even with my thick beard.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is well built and does the job. Its a good buy. It just trims and doesn&#x27;t have unnecessary bells and whistles of the more expensive models.</li>
    <li> works very good, happy with product....</li>
    <li> My husband has used the trimmer several times and has been quite pleased with the way it worked. It shaved a months-long beard and worked great.</li>
    <li> a bit weak, and feels a bit more like a toy...</li>
    <li> It lasted for 3 months. Simply stopped working.</li>
    <li> It is often difficult to find that perfect trimmer. Sometimes they don&#x27;t get a close enough trim, sometimes they run too hot and sometimes they just don&#x27;t hold a charge. This Norelco model has it ALL. The second you turn it on and start you can just feel the quality and the trim is EXCELLENT. A+ and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband has a very short beard, almost a stubble.  This gave him the perfect trim.  He popped the guard off to trim his mustache.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty limited amount of facial hair for my age so I can&#x27;t grow much without it looking bad. I can pull off a light stubble. Shaving with a razor really wrecks my skin so I needed a really close shaver. This thing gets the job done at a solid price.</li>
    <li> This replaces an older model Norelco trimmer.  So far so good with a few uses.  Settings hold and trimmer cuts evenly for that well groomed look.  I miss the vacuum feature though.  That model is more pricey.  Lots of stubble in the sink as a result of no vacuum.  But all in all, nice trimmer for the price!</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave! I love it and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Trimmer point options doesn&#x27;t work properly. Its better get one that has separate blade options like 0.5,1 and 2, which is easy to use</li>
    <li> My old Norelco broke, and I tried a Braun Cruzer, which was a piece of garbage, so I purchased this. It charges quickly, and easily trimmed by beard with nice power, providing a very quick and even cut. 10 times better than the Braun and better than my old Norelco. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on battery life.</li>
    <li> A very simple and effective trimmer to use.  An excellent piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> about two weeks ago i ordered a wahl corded hair/beard trimmer (as it was advertised), and while i was pleased with it&#x27;s hair clipping abilities, i was quite disappointed in the way it cut my beard.  it pulled hairs and cut unevenly on the face...so i figured maybe it&#x27;s too good to be true to have a head/beard trimmer all in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i ordered this...got it yesterday.  i admit, i&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far i&#x27;m very impressed.  it&#x27;s a simple hand held clipper, easy to hold, easy to use, and has twenty cutting settings set by adjustable dial on the unit.  i thought i wore my stubble pretty short, but i cut it on 1.5 setting and it was just right...this did not pull my hairs or irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it also works &amp;#34;down south&amp;#34; too.  i will update if need be...but so far i like this little trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as an added bonus for me...it&#x27;s small and comes with minimal attachments...so it doesn&#x27;t look bad or take up a lot of space if left on counter.</li>
    <li> I used to use another beardtrimmer, but it broke because it sucked, so I got this one instead. It is amazing. Recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works good.  Battery holds a charge very well.</li>
    <li> Cross-posting this from the Conair i-Stubble review.... This is a comparison of Conair i-Stubble vs Philips Norelco QT4014/42. I have both. Conair is a better trimmer from perspective of trimming dynamics. It simply cuts your facial hair better than the Phillips. I feel like I can trim with just a couple passes in a very controlled manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives about the Conair is that it is a little more flimsy than the Phillips. My first i-Stubble had a bad battery and died within a week. I contacted Conair and they replaced it with a new unit immediately. Since then I had ZERO issues with i-Stubble. The other negative is that the power button on the unit is very easy to press. So not really realistic to travel with i-Stubble in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of the Phillips is that it is sturdier than Conair. Better for traveling. No way to accidentally bump the slide switch on the Phillips. The battery also lasts for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, use Conair for at home. Take Phillips on the road. However, if I were to have just one, I would stick with the Conair. Just trim before you travel and don&#x27;t pack a trimmer, or pack the charger for the Conair in case you activate the power button by accident inside your luggage.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing purchase. A great price and Quality razor.</li>
    <li> I hate writing bad reviews but I have had such bad luck with Philips trimmers. This one started out cutting well but it stopped working within two months. Doesn&#x27;t respond after charging. Light blinks while charging but once I press the power button, the trimmer is unresponsive. I can&#x27;t even return it because I believe I&#x27;m outside my return period (only a month!)?</li>
    <li> Since I purchased the trimmer I have loved every minute of use with it! Always fast and the batteries stay charged for a very long time. The only issue I have had is that there are times when it doesn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like, but it isn&#x27;t a shaver so I can&#x27;t complain. With the simple design it is a breeze to clean off and tuck away, while it is even easier to use and adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Guys let me tell you, best trimmer out there for the price. After using it for about 6 months now it has worked like a charm for me and gave me just the precise length to trim at. Not to mention the battery life is amazing on this thing. I could use it up to 5-6 times before I need to recharge it for maybe about 2-3 hours for a full charge. Really impressed and will refer this to anyone or even buy again!</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer, and would recommend it, but hair can get everywhere because there isn&#x27;t really a guard to catch it. I bought it primarily because it can be used while plugged in or on battery. batteries quickly die on cheaper trimmers, which means they completely stop working and are useless. I will update in the future if this one keeps working for a long time.</li>
    <li> The click settings stay in place very well (I&#x27;ve had other trimmers that don&#x27;t). The trimmer cleans very easily. It&#x27;s comfortable to use. It wasn&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
    <li> Almost a clean shave!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can trim my facial hair to different lengths for my goatee, mustache, cheeks, and side-burns.  I love the clean look I get when I can make the different places on my face a consistent length as my facial hairs grow at a different rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a regular disposable blade to clean up under the goatee and cheeks as well as the miscellaneous hairs that grow above the cheeks, otherwise it is the trimmer that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Aim at the hairs with the hair pointing at the trimmer as many hairs will curl and aim in different directions.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my Norelco QT4022 and I am not satisfied.  Both units advertise that they can trim to 0.5 mm at their lowest setting, but this trimmer cannot.  I spent about three times longer than normal attempting to get my beard as short as possible, but I was unsuccessful.  The actual blades sit slightly lower on this unit, so I don&#x27;t see how Philips can advertise that it cuts just as short, it&#x27;s just not possible.  Despite being louder, I also do not think the trimmer is as powerful as the older model.  The design overall is poor, the switch is odd and the horizontal lines on the body of the unit get filled with hair.  I&#x27;m returning this unit and trying another brand.</li>
    <li> it works better than I expected! the dial makes it easy and convenient to get the right shave every time.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my son at his request.  Keeps his beard neatly trimmed.  He&#x27;s very pleased with the performance and control it gives him when trimming his beard.  Would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice correct shave every time</li>
    <li> Great deal!!!!!! I gave five stars cuting my beard, but today my wife cut my hairs using the set number 10 (brush style). The result was simply perfect. Now I&#x27;ll give 6 stars.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is exactly what I needed and does just what I wanted done. I have a combination mustache and goatee with an open space on my lower lip area. Trying to shave this open area and shaving close on the outer edges was nerve racking at best. This shaving attachment works perfectly for these areas. The ear and nose hair trimmer works well also. I have not tried the beard trimmer as I already have another unit for that. However, if and when I need it, I am sure that it will work fine.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very adjustable and does what it says it does. Great product. Produces a good even trim of stubble at length you set it.</li>
    <li> For basic beard and moustache trimming it&#x27;s fine.  As for durability, time will tell.</li>
    <li> Trims evenly, and the adjustment works well.</li>
    <li> Average in every respect.  Comb width too narrow for a smooth, even trim.  Comb/guard flimsy and cheap-looking.  NOT a good long-term choice.  Better choices are available.</li>
    <li> After years of fumbling around with less-than-stellar clippers for my beard, I bought this yesterday. It was delivered the same day, and upon receiving it I immediately plugged it in to charge it. In less than an hour, it was ready to trim my two-week-old beard. I set it for the closest setting, and was amazed at how smoothly it glided over my face, while still cutting close enough to give me the stubble look I prefer when I trim (1-2 week intervals are normal for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous clippers either tore my face to shreds or didn&#x27;t do much of anything at all. (Note: it may be possible that I was not properly using some of these other devices, but that&#x27;s another virtue of this one - it&#x27;s hard to do it wrong with the attached comb.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an effective, affordable way to trim your beard, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing battery life.  My wife bought this trimmer for me last Christmas.  I trim my beard once a week.  Now it is late June, and I&#x27;m recharging it for the first time.  Does a great job of trimming as well.  A wonderful product.</li>
    <li> pretty great. shaves really close (which I like) so you can do a stubble shave with it. Also has tons of settings, is rechargable, and quite affordable. perfect for all your man-needs</li>
    <li> Works well, no complaints here. I use it because I dont like to keep a clean shave.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is one of the lightest I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve not had to charge it yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on how much time it takes to charge it.  However, it is very good at trimming the parts of my face that I sometimes miss with my shaver (sides of my neck and around my Adam&#x27;s apple).  Overall, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for 62 years, and I continue to purchase their products.  This razor does a great job of maintaining the length of your beard, and it also trims very well to maintain a neat appearance.</li>
    <li> It is very good. Love the compact size. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I&#x27;ve had multiple other clippers that were not beard specific, and they all pull my beard hairs when going against the grain.  This one does not pull at all, has plenty of length adjustments, it&#x27;s battery lasts a long time, it is compact and easy to take traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I keep my beard at about a 2 week to 1 month growth level (depending on season).</li>
    <li> Have had a few beard trimmers over the years and this one is super consistent.  Hardly ever get missed hairs or uneven sections.  Nice even shave on the first swipe.  Been using this (3-4 min/time) weekly for 6+ weeks and have not had to recharge at all.</li>
    <li> Really precise, it has a lot of options on beard size. Good quality, and is really light and not spacey.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Battery charge lasted much longer than expected. Easy on the clean up. The multiple settings makes this very useful.</li>
    <li> I have gone though a boat load of trimmers.  I am no good and storing stuff.  So the little Beard Length adapters on your average razors disappear over time.  This beauty has the length adjustment built right into the thing.  You just twist a dial for the desired length.  I didn&#x27;t take long to figure out the best setting for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well.  Gives me that right beard length with ease. Not sure I can get a Homer Simpson five o&#x27;clock shadow with this, but that is not my thing anyway.</li>
    <li> A high quality product that would fulfill your expectations for sure.</li>
    <li> The face belonging to the individual writing this review has never seen a razor blade. No, in fact, I&#x27;ve always used a hair trimmer or beard trimmer to shave. After realizing my existing beard trimmers had a memory on the battery and would only run for a few minutes, I started researching trimmers. On my list of requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life - longer than 5 minutes in 1 charge&lt;br /&gt;Rounded blades - so you can shave sensitive areas without slicing them open&lt;br /&gt;Works while plugged in - in case you run out of juice&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable with minimal effort - meaning, I don&#x27;t have to carry a bag of guards with me when I travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meets my demands and then some. First, the battery holds a great charge, as advertised. It comes with a great travel pouch (fabric with a pull tie), and the trimmer guard is adjustable + removable. Plus, the top of the blade just pops off, and you can use the brush to clean out the excess hair. The trimmer is also relatively quiet. The one I was using before sounded like a weed-whacker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the rounded blades and adjustable guard. Yes, you can trim your nether-area without slicing it off. I&#x27;m not a very hirsute man and I can&#x27;t attest to the trimming of the chest or back hair with this device. However, facial hair - yes. The guard is great if you want a certain length, and if you want to wipe it clean, removal of the card doesn&#x27;t pull hair, prick, cut, or cause any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say? Philips made a great product... better than my cordless Remington is/was. Register it and get extra time on your warranty (or I did, anyway. Not sure if that&#x27;s a time limited promotion to be honest).</li>
    <li> Because it pulled my beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it is because  the knife wasn´t sharp enough. Or the machine wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does the job perfectly. As advertised, it fully charges in 1 hour  and lasts for 50 minutes. Light and easy to handle. I use it on the lowest setting and without the comb because it doesn&#x27;t do me any good. This is why I gave 4 and not 5. All in all this is a good product and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this Beard and Stubble Trimmer.  It takes me a long time to grow facial hair so the very small lengths help out big time.  I would recommend these for any one who needs a starter trimmer.</li>
    <li> I like to have that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look and these don&#x27;t quite get my stubble short enough.  Still is small and convenient for the gym.</li>
    <li> superbe battery life, recharge super fast. best trimmer i got so far.</li>
    <li> Works great and great price.</li>
    <li> Best affordable self grooming tool I&#x27;ve ever owned. I love the multiple settings and the battery life. Just be sure to keep on the guard, these teeth are sharp</li>
    <li> works perfectly . really great product</li>
    <li> Trims the beard and mustache just the way I want it....no troubles! I have only charged it once since I got it 5-6 weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Does not cut very close, but not a huge issue. Works great in all other aspects.</li>
    <li> It does the job for just the right price!</li>
    <li> I started growing my winter beard early this year and my old trimmer decided to call it quits. Glad I found this one as a replacement, there is a good range to length settings to dial in the right look. It has enough power to trim without needing to do multiple passes. My favorite part though is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing adapters since it&#x27;s just the one guard</li>
    <li> This product is very good, I like!</li>
    <li> cheap and poorly made imho. I sent it back and got the Norelco QT4050 Vacuum one and it&#x27;s fantastic.  I did not think I&#x27;d like the vaccum for some reason and now I can&#x27;t live w/o it.</li>
    <li> It does a good job trimming my beard. I like the range of settings, and the ease of cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd beard trimmer in 20 years and is my favorite. The first one was great, but the battery finally wore out after more than 10 years. The second I never liked, and got thrown out in a move. Now I own the Norelco 3500:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I love the fine adjustments available for the guard, and the fact that the number is easy to translate into an actual length (millimeters).&lt;br /&gt;-- The guard is very easy to remove and replace, which is nice for trimming my beard near the lips.&lt;br /&gt;-- The guard does not get stuck in my beard.&lt;br /&gt;-- These blades will not cut you the way that most blades will, meaning you have a much easier time of using the clipper with the guard removed, and can use it in sensitive areas without fear.&lt;br /&gt;-- The battery life is great. That&#x27;s not a big deal if you always leave the cord attached, but is important for vacations. One problem I have is beard trimmers (in general) sometimes activating in my luggage and going dead.&lt;br /&gt;-- I&#x27;ve never owned a vacuum trimmer, just FYI. Maybe those are worth the extra money, but I wouldn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: There is a cheaper version of this (the 3100), but I don&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;This one has titanium blades (which will outlast the internal electronics), 10 more settings/levels, and a MUCH bigger battery.&lt;br /&gt;Just spend the extra money for this model.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Great for trimming beard, moustache, eyebrows, and over the ears when the hair gets a little longer. Easy to clean. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> We have to use in opposite direction for complete function. Sometimes it cut our skins also</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco trimmer has an excellent height setting mechanism that holds its adjustment well.  I&#x27;ve battled an older Remington beard trimmer that has required two beard trimmer attachment replacements since they each wear out over time and can&#x27;t hold their setting.  Nothing like shaving and suddenly realizing that the shaver comb moved a couple settings and now you&#x27;ve got different stubble heights across your face.  The Philips&#x27; design has a positive adjustment that can&#x27;t be moved unless you purposely twist a dial --good design.  The trimmer is high quality and feels like it will last several years.  The handle is comfortable to hold and the comb has a nice contour without any sharp edges.  The comb is easily removable if you want the closest shave.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this trimmer.  Takes 20 minutes to do a mediocre job.  Keep looking I&#x27;d return mine if I could.</li>
    <li> States to cut down t o 0.5mm, I  doubt it because I have a Conair iStubble whose 0.6mm looks shorter. It cuts well at the length it can cut, but not a a great subble trimmer.</li>
    <li> Does not cut evenly. The front part guard tends to push some of the hairs down, rather than grab them and cut them.</li>
    <li> Works well, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> These is a very nice trimmer, easy to use and feels really good in the hand! The size is perfect and the cut is super! I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone. I&#x27;ve only used these to keep my beard trimmed short.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the sharpness of the teeth on the plastic guard, but it&#x27;s a nice trimmer overall.  The laser serves no purpose for me, just a neat little novelty unless you&#x27;re some sort of laser pro.</li>
    <li> -It works and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes it will trim the beard with accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes you can trim your pubic region.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes it gets warm.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes having a spray/lubricant for clippers is useful. I use the same stuff you find used by barbers.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes the battery eventually dies.&lt;br /&gt;-No it does not make sense changing the battery for the cost to benefit ratio isn&#x27;t there. You are better off just buying a new one when this does die and that should occur at a minimal 3 years from the time of purchase unless you got a lemon.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes you can cut your skin if you are not careful. The shorter you adjust the guide the closer it gets to the skin. Commonsense tells you to make sure it stays flush to the body, and keep the skin from curling so it does not get caught in the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-No it&#x27;s NOT waterproof so don&#x27;t do it while in the shower UNLESS the water is off. I am sure you are thinking duh! Trust me, I met plenty of people that needed that told to them.&lt;br /&gt;-A bristle brush IMHO is the best way to clean this thing. Remove the guide, do a few swipes of the clipper with a brush and it&#x27;s clean. The guide just rinse off and let it air dry before installing it back in the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;-What if I lose the guide? Really you are going to lose that guide? How about paying attention to what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;-It does hold a charge more than long enough with the amount of use I get out of it. In fact, I yet to charge it a second time since the time of purchase and that was literally months ago.&lt;br /&gt;-The only thing better than this for the pubic region is the Wahl Peanut due to it&#x27;s size/convenience especially for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should cover it. This review is based on a few things and in no particular order:&lt;br /&gt;1. Questions I seen on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;2. Personal experiences with manscaping; I learned what NOT to do&lt;br /&gt;3. Having used this model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want some more info about me and my qualifications, in my early 20&#x27;s due to complaints from a certain someone getting hair in a certain place I decided to start manscaping. For awhile used scissors but for all the obvious reasons I knew there had to be a better way. As soon as I heard of a person manscaping with a beard trimmer I had to try it. First time doing it I found it to be very easy and better results in comparison to scissors. The big thing was to be careful in certain areas and before this model I never went lower than a #4 but on this model I been doing #2 setting with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a &amp;#34;hair trimmer&amp;#34; versus a &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34; is night and day especially when you are talking about guides. For instance a #4 on a hair trimmer versus a beard trimmer has a significant difference. So if you want to trim your beard, back, front, or groin stick to a beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl Peanut by design is a tiny little unit so when you are dealing with obstacles it&#x27;s convenient. However, I didn&#x27;t buy the battery unit, I went with the one that must be plugged in. Not a big deal but requires a minute or more of prep work plus an extension cord so I can trim in places of my home where I don&#x27;t need to worry about the hair that falls. That is where this thing comes in; you can grab and trim at a moments notice as long as the battery power is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the other thing that kept me from returning to battery powered clippers for awhile is how the battery units usually are dead when you need them the most. Now that I have the plug-in Wahl it&#x27;s not a big deal, plus this thing being able to charge in 1-hour is a huge plus too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since I got this thing at a discount it was a no brainer.

    <li> So far, after a few weeks, works great. This replaced my old trimmer that I had for about 10 years, so that&#x27;s my standard. I would have given this five stars if it had a base, or was designed to stand up.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver!  So glad I got it.  So many shavers are crap.  I use this one for everything I shave (head and beard).  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Works great for thick beards, very happy.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend, he had a really long beard for years and used scissors for neatness, but now he has a shorter scruffy thing going on with a mustache- he was using plain clippers for a while, so now he likes this beard trimmer a lot. This dude has a lot of course facial hair that grows pretty much lightning-fast, but this works well for him. He is a carpenter and is pretty particular about his tools, so I knew if I bought a crappy one it would just gather dust so I shopped around a little. He had a beard trimmer long ago and says this one is way better. He sometimes uses it at the gym when necessary- it&#x27;s convenient and subtle. He told me he wasn&#x27;t into charging it and planned on just plugging it in old-school style (probably assumed it wouldn&#x27;t work well) but he likes that it holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> I have tried several of the &amp;#34;beard trimmers&amp;#34; available on Amazon. For me this is the best of the bunch and I love the long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my mustache and love it.</li>
    <li> it says it can cut down to 0.5mm and it is not true for the face. It may do it on a flat surface. I would return it but can&#x27;t return once package is opened and used. So, if you are looking for very short stubble, don&#x27;t waste money on this product.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer does a swell job of trimming my beard. It is thin and compact, and does not required to be plugged in to use. Good job, company who made this.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does an excellent job on preciseness. It trims your beard down to almost nothing or longer if you wish. It is excellent and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have had the trimmer for about three months now, and have used it weekly about 2 times every week. That being said, I have yet to charge it. It never dies! I love the battery life on this, but even better, the blades and shape of the trimmer make it extremely easy to create a very short stubble look. It is easy to adjust the length (although I just use the shortest setting) and it locks in place securely without worry. I cannot recommend this enough! I would like to point out too that it is fairly quiet, however, it can create quite a mess. There is another option by Philips that is only $15 more and is equipped with a vacuum if you&#x27;re worried about cleanup. I love this trimmer so much though that i&#x27;ll stick with it and deal with the 30 second cleanup. Plus this is the only one in the lineup that is washable which is nice. If you want a simple, well-designed trimmer, get this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use thos basically to trim my beard, I had it only for a couple of months but so far it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several trimmers including other Norelco models and like the convenience and clear settings on this one. The well that collects the trimmings is a little difficult to clean, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is one of those reviews that I may revise after I have more experience with the product. This is my first beard trimmer. I have now used it for only about month, so I am still making up my mind about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this trimmer after watching a couple of videos comparing different beard trimmers on Youtube. Unfortunately, both were used by someone with a stubble beard; mine is a more traditional length. Reviews of various brands and models on Amazon and elsewhere did not suggest a consistent winner at the $50 and below price point I was looking at, so I took a chance on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it seems to work OK with my beard. I have been using it about once a week to keep it looking neat and it seems to do a reasonably good job. I still need to finish up with comb &amp; scissors, but overall I spend much less time and effort in actually trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, cleanup takes at least as long as it did before I started using the trimmer. In addition to the clippings in and around the sink, the trimmer itself and the cutting head attract clippings. Although the cutting head is removable and washable, the area in which it sits in the trimmer can only be brushed clean—and it does attract lots of clippings. In hindsight, I might have considered one of Philips Norelco&#x27;s vacuum models, which apparently do a very good job of sucking up the cut hairs. These all come at a higher price, however.</li>
    <li> Its has an awesome backup...works for 1hr continuous abd charges very fast. Ideal for stubble look and hair trimminh if you have short hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer for about a month now and it works great.  I especially like the dial to adjust the guard on it and it works great.  I haven&#x27;t found that I accidentally change it at all.  Probably the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was it is a little bit of a pain to clean.  You can put the blades under the water, but I find the trimmings also get down under the blades and even using the included brush to clean it isn&#x27;t easy.</li>
    <li> Adjustable trim depth? Yup. Quick charge? Yup. Consistent trim? Definitely. Randomly turns on in the drawer while the power switch is in the off position? Yes, yes indeed. Around two weeks into owning this stubble trimmer this is exactly what occurred. Once it started there was no stopping it until the battery ran out -- took around an hour. So great battery life then! Customer service from Philips is sending a replacement -- seven to ten business days.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great for varying the length and thickness of your beard for seasonal changes, while still being able to trim clear and sharp lines between the beard and unshaven areas. It also does great for hair on the ear. I like the smoothe rounded head that determines the different lengths desired and glides over any imperfections (scar or mole) within the beard.</li>
    <li> Bought to trim my goatee. To get it even took too many passes - was like rubbing it over my face. Also not suitable as an edger.</li>
    <li> I am a kind of expert on trimmers as I use stubble for almost 15 years. If you do not like to carry many different combs (which I do not), this is the best product you can find. Phillips has learned from previous models and make this one which is  perfect.  It trims perfect, the comb is very gentle with your skin, the angle in which is build is perfect, is light . Of course if you use very short stubble then eventually you can see cut lines, but that is inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that is build of plastic, probably will not last much and if it falls probably will broke, but for the price I think is still good quality.</li>
    <li> Have used the qt4014/42 for about a month. It does not cut as close as I was expecting. I was wanting to use it like a razor to avoid razor bumps, and it does give a close shave with a midnight shadow look. It is light and easy to use and light weight. So far I have charge it up once and used it every morning for a month with no recharge. Wish it came with a stand. So far so good. Time will tell how it holds up.</li>
    <li> FINALLY I can trim my beard to Many Many different levels and lengths. I went with this over the more expensive ones cause it has more settings in a smaller range .... If you have a shorter beard or are looking to trim at lower levels (you know you can&#x27;t have an operators beard or look like you are duck dynasty). I like a short trimmed clean looking beard and this gives me the EXACT perfect length I am looking for an also gives me the ability to make it a TINY Bit shorter or longer due to the 20 settings within a small range.&lt;br /&gt;If you look at settings they have 20 over the more expensive one that has 18 ... BUT that&#x27;s not the kicker .... this has 20 levels of length &amp;#34;within a 10mm range&amp;#34; ... the more expensive ones have less settings at 18 BUT are spanned out over a range up to 18mm.&lt;br /&gt;So in turn if you have a shorter beard and want MANY more level settings then this is the one to buy .... if you have a longer beard and like it less clean looking then maybe the less settings spanned out over the 18mm length range may be better for you!&lt;br /&gt;The power seems okay and it cuts Perfect! Not Li-Ion battery but battery seems to hold up fine so far.&lt;br /&gt;I use a Wahl Li_ion expensive trimmer for all my grooming and trimming needs ... but for my BEARD ... this is the only way to go to get it just right and perfect! And I got it on sale on top of a $5 coupon clipped as well, only paid 25 bucks! Thanks :)</li>
    <li> It is very comfortable for beard shaving.</li>
    <li> Get a 5 o clock shadow look easily!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have been buying crappy $15 trimmers that always break down when a product like this is out there! Simple yet perfect.</li>
    <li> Perfect. My gf likes when I shave my face on the 1 setting and my neck on .5, it looks like 2-day stubble.&lt;br /&gt;You can also remove the plastic guard and touch up your sideburns and jawline as well. I can use it maybe 20 times on one charge, which makes it a great travel razor. Easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very powerful, it trims nice and even. However if you remove the guard it may cut you. I&#x27;ll spare the details, just be careful where and how you trim with the guard off.</li>
    <li> The battery so far is great, but user-replaceable AA or AAA would have made more sense than rechargeable battery you can&#x27;t replace, IMO. It only cuts so-so. Without the guard on, the shaver does not cut close enough so it looks like you shaved, but it doesn&#x27;t leave enough stubble to really be considered stubble either. It leaves you dirty-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the guard on, the shaver has a hard time cutting the hair, and it takes a really large number of passes to get the length indicated by the dial. Using a &#x27;real&#x27; hair clipper like a Wahl or Remington that&#x27;s meant for haircuts, the cutting goes so much quicker, in 1-2 passes instead of 9-10 passes for this Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer is made cheaply.  The mechanism that allows the length setting to change is easily moved, resulting in uneven trimming. Twice in a little over one month (just past the return cutoff), the beard trimmer has changed settings while trimming, resulting in me needing to shave my whole beard.  That really ticks me off. I cant return this item but I am purchasing a different product today.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco QT4014/42  My GRANDSON loves  this.  I gave it to him for his 25th birthday.</li>
    <li> Works good, Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best trimmer I have ever owned. For not much more money than some of the basic trimmers, this one is an incredible upgrade. The battery is extremely long lasting, and the trim guard adjustment is solid. The trim guard itself is easy to remove and reattach without feeling like your weakening the mechanism. The way the trim guard attaches makes it almost impossible to accidentally change settings or detach while trimming, but again, easily removes when you want it to. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve gashed (and ruined) my beard by knocking the trim guard off in mid-trim. That is not a problem with this bad boy. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works very well for cutting beard at a certain height but wish it had an easy trimmer for trimming edges.</li>
    <li> So far, this has been the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve had (I&#x27;m at 20 years of bearded-ness). It charges super quickly and the frame is very well designed. The blade removes easily and is a snap to clean. The guide is solid and clips in and out very easily and firmly.  The guide adjusts at 0.5mm increments, which makes the maximum length less than other trimmers, but personally, I&#x27;ve always found the max length settings on trimmers to be way past the point most folks would switch to a pair of scissors. I.e., I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used the top 3 settings on any trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, so &amp;#34;trading&amp;#34; those for more precise increments is a great feature in my estimation.</li>
    <li> Works great for me with the guard removed to trim my &#x27;beard&#x27; as short as possible without actually shaving. Doesn&#x27;t bite me as often used this way as the many year old trimmer it replaced. Also higher speed motor and blades that don&#x27;t need to be oiled.</li>
    <li> I got this strictly for trimming my beard and sideburns etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I am so glad I bought this.. works PERFECT and is great quality as well as the different length settings lock in well and make it super easy to get the perfect length!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased customer over here!</li>
    <li> The adjustable clip could be improved. As other reviews state it blocks some hair so you have to go over the same spot multiple times to get an even cut. Upside, the charge lasts a very long time and the titanium blades make for easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised Adjustments and blade guard taking minimal getting used to. It&#x27;s what I expected and works well.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product, glad I read the reviews and &amp;#34;traded up&amp;#34; over what I had planned to buy.This trimmer is far superior in power, quality and staying &amp;#34;charged&amp;#34; over the two that I had previously bought in department stores.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why they offset the handle. Everything else works very well, and I am pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
    <li> Pleasant surprise, I had low expectations after being disappointment buying other trimmers.  Great trimmer for home use or travel, small size, light, small charger 110-240 V, runs quiet, smooth and cuts with ease.  Simple to adjust the length, no extra attachments needed. Works great, very pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;update 3/2014&lt;br /&gt;still running strong, battery hold charge for long time.</li>
    <li> Works great, does my mustache &amp; beard the way I like it. Highly recommended. Good service.</li>
    <li> Nice compact design. Good range of trim lengths.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s waterproof so I&#x27;m always a little worried when I rinse the trimmer off after using it.  But so far no concerns.  Having said all that, it&#x27;s good value for the price you pay, but the cutting area (length wise) could be larger.  As I said it is compact.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to use. No problems</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband and he&#x27;s very impressed with how nice and close it trims his scruff. Great quality for the price I paid :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have been using the trimmer on a shaver with both a screen for shaving close and a trimmer for cutting things like sideburns for shaving my face to leave stubble, but the trimmer was not strong enough to cut all the hairs it went over at once.  I had to go over each area about ten times (literally) before everything was cut, making shaving take forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This QT4014, because it&#x27;s a dedicated trimmer I guess, is powerful enough that I only have to go over each area once or twice.  Finally it is quick and easy to shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can remove the guard completely so that you can get the actual metal trimmers right against your skin, so you can cut the hairs pretty close.  It is not as close as the trimmer on my old shaver, but &amp;#34;85%&amp;#34; as close I would say, so still very acceptable.  It&#x27;s pretty much as close as you can get before just shaving with an actual foil meant for cutting the hair off completely.  The trimmers don&#x27;t scrape my skin or catch my skin and cut it.  Feels pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Pulls hair if moved too fast</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, great value!  Don&#x27;t waste time or money looking elsewhere, this is the best trimmer I have ever owned, and for a great price.</li>
    <li> If you have under 100 hairs on your chin this beard trimmer may work for you.  I usually have to make 3 or 4 passes to get all the hairs.  The guard is a joke- it bends quite a bit during use and gets easily clogged with hair.  The pro is that the battery lasts quite a long time and the trimmer itself is pretty compact.</li>
    <li> I am totally shocked that anyone like this, let alone so may great reviews!! I really don&#x27;t get it. Is my product defective? Is this really how it&#x27;s supposed to work?  And people like it??? smh&lt;br /&gt;The guard that allow you to adjust the height of the trim is super flimsy. I used the &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; setting, but when I went to shave, it was actually the pressure applied to my face that determined how close it got.  I ruined by beard.  I now have patches and spots where it trimmed closer than the setting.  The the piece that adjust is only anchored on one end, which is why it flexes so much. I&#x27;m returning mine immediately and I am thankful that my beard grows fast and that it is a friday, because I couldn&#x27;t go back to work like this.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD TRIMMER. Just wish it had the vacuum and I could get to the really really really hard to reach places. Otherwise the half mm settings, the sleek look and the ease of use make this almost perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer, I use it to keep my beard short and defined.the battery lasts about a dozen shaves, and the trimmer is easy and comfortable to use. I would recommend this preduct to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is everything what it claims to be. No more, no less.</li>
    <li> Great features. It is nice to have so many lengths built into one trimmer. Now I don&#x27;t have to waste my time flipping through attachments</li>
    <li> Works well for stubble trim. Length guard is easily removed by sliding out completely. Actual trimmer blade mechanism is difficult to thoroughly clean and seem fragile when removing and replacing trimmer blade from plastic parts mating trimmer blade to main body of trimmer (motor mechanism). Can&#x27;t wash with water so best can do is blow out where trimmer blade mates to main body of trimmer with compressed air. Only time will tell if will last until non-replaceable battery runs out. All the manufacturers are making these with non-replaceable battery so have to throw it out and buy a new trimmer when battery life runs its course.</li>
    <li> trimmer itself is good, I just do not like the length adjustment clip( actual trimming length varies depending on the holding position)</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer.  Quality product and great adjustment features.</li>
    <li> Does a great job trimming my husband&#x27;s beard. several settings that make it as versatile as he needs.</li>
    <li> Nice product. gives a very close shave !&lt;br /&gt;worth the money</li>
    <li> Did not like this razor. The curved end did not let the hair fall away and would get clogged up and make it harder to cut also.</li>
    <li> Works very nicely. Had an old Wahl before this one and the good thing with the Philips is the adjustable comb, which maintains the right length of beard no matter at what angle you are holding the trimmer. It is also designed to catch a fair amount of the trimmings, although that does not worry me so much.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It&#x27;s good for what it is made for. Nice trimming, a bit noisy but not that much. If you want a better height regulation for haircut, for example, consider buying another one from Philips.</li>
    <li> I liked it, it was quality and fast shipping too, thamks</li>
    <li> lightweight easy to use. I like that the size selection is a dial. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it moving while trimming as some of the trimmers i&#x27;ve had in the past have. The plastic comb is a little flimsy but it should hold up if you not overly hard with it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months on and off and am still on the original charge. The instructions say when you first get it to use it till is runs out of battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to clean too, just rinse the blade under the faucet. It is NOT water proof so don&#x27;t use it in the shower. Just the blade tip can handle the water. The instructions say you don&#x27;t need to oil the blade but I do anyway. Its not a loud trimmer either its fairly quiet but has plenty of power. I use it mostly to trim around my ears and neck as well as side burns. The comb does fill up with hair quickly so needs to be cleaned often. No big deal as I know its not meant for hair cutting but for me its works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all its a great little buzzer and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Quality trimmer at an affordable price. Does the job, what else is there to say. Have had it for three weeks ... use it every 3 days or so. After initial charge, I&#x27;ve yet to see the LED light telling me I need to recharge. Cleanup after use takes seconds. Worth the price. Highly recommended as a first trimmer although I cannot imagine why anyone would spend more $$$ for anything else as this model does everything.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas because his ten-year-old trimmer was dying. He&#x27;s used it now, and it&#x27;s really convenient that it cleaned up much more easily than his previous trimmer (and now our bathroom drawers are also much cleaner). It wasn&#x27;t even quite as loud as his previous one. The main drawback for us is that the longest setting is still fairly short (I think it&#x27;s somewhere around an inch-- about a half inch or so shorter than the longest setting on the previous one).</li>
    <li> i love this shaver and the adjustable incorporated head was a great change from the individual adapters i had on my last shaver.  It cuts very nicely and the only thing i wish was that the base was water proof for easier cleaning.</li>
    <li> The single brush makes it very handy!</li>
    <li> perfect for beard trimming, battery life is amazing!!</li>
    <li> Cuts hair well, very easy to use, broke after one cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this trimmer a month ago and used it successfully for 3 weeks.  When it was time to shave again, I decided to rinse out some hair that had become trapped inside.  While rinsing under the sink with the trimmer on to help vibrate the hair out, the motor died almost entirely.  When switched on, it can still be felt vibrating, but it is almost imperceptible.  You can hear it humming more than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this might be a battery issue, so I let it recharge for several hours, sit for a couple of days, everything.  Motor is still dead.  Not sure how water is able to kill a device that is supposed to be water proof, but make sure to take care cleaning yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, I decided to clean it for the first time one day after I would have been able to return it.  I probably averaged about $5 per shave, which is still cheaper than a barbershop I guess.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this trimmer.  He uses it a couple times a day for about 1 minute each time. Keeps his stubble looking very neat.</li>
    <li> the comb teeth are too widely set, even slightly curly beard hairs slip between and away from the blades.  When you press firmly to try to eliminate this effect, it shaves much closer than the dial leads to believe.  Buyer beware,</li>
    <li> Tight compact and easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t feel like a professional model but way above quality of some cheaper models.</li>
    <li> Awesome for stubble look, but a little trickier to use for anything approaching a light beard and longer.</li>
    <li> Perfect trimmer. This is my first one and it is great. Nice and simple.</li>
    <li> works great - easy to clean and use</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough compared to other comparable products. Husband said he really had to work at it to get it to trim. Returned it and got another one instead.</li>
    <li> Works great, simple to use and clean.  Seems to keep a charge so far too.</li>
    <li> I have a really, REALLY thick beard and this trimmer does the job pretty well</li>
    <li> Perfect for &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; my head. Using the number one setting it gets the closeness in wanted.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller!</li>
    <li> Without the guard on you don&#x27;t quite get as hard a line as I would like, but keeping the blades away from the face is probably a safety feature. Otherwise all around 5 stars, hardly ever needs charging, and stays clean!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son. He started using it and looks much less like a billy goat and more like a handsome young man!</li>
    <li> Product catches easily on skin even with guard. The guard makes it difficult to get a quick trim in, I usually just use my clippers instead. I have maybe used this 10 times tops since I have gotten it.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s old one gave out and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. To replace it this was the closest model. I was a little skeptical when I saw it on Amazon as it looked nothing like the old one but times change and this one does the job for him. He does have to go over the area twice instead of once because the width of the trimmer is smaller than the old one which was wider but the dial up is nicer on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re replacing one of the old Norelco beard trimmers, this is your best bet.</li>
    <li> Much better, albeit smaller, than my previous trimmer.  It does not have a large head but that is good for fine trimming.  Good battery reserve and easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> the best I have used for my trimming needs</li>
    <li> I like this thing. It&#x27;s very convenient. I wish the shave was closer, though.</li>
    <li> The adjustable guard freely floats on the front side of the trimmer (the side you see in the picture). The guard bends up or down in length depending on how hard you push, which results in an uneven shave. Absolute terrible design. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> First off, this a not a multipurpose grooming tool; This is a trimmer, just a trimmer. You will not be able to shape up your beard or clean up some of your straggly hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that that is out of the way, Let me explain why is is a great trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco QT4014 rundown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1.) Cordless - but can use while charging&lt;br /&gt;  2.) Maintenance free - no need to oil the blades before you use it or after its cleaned and an easily detachable and washable head.&lt;br /&gt;  3.) 20 adjustable settings - 0.5 mm to 10 mm (1/32&amp;#34; to 13/32&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;  4.) Rounded tips - for a non-irritating shave&lt;br /&gt;  5.) Long lasting battery - 90 minutes of use on a 1 hour charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t tested it with my beard at full length because of work,  I still tend to accumulate about weeks worth of growth before I have to shave it back down. Until winter and I can have a full beautiful beard I mainly use this pre-shaving. That being said, I&#x27;ve never had any hair pulling, the Qt4014 hacks and slashed though my facial hair like knife though butter. When I remove the adjuster to get as close as I can before I shave it, the blades offer no skin irritation. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s do to it&#x27;s rounded tips and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I bought the particular trimmer is because is simplistic design makes it great for traveling. Its cordless, so if you&#x27;re going on a trip you can take it with you and with how long the battery lasts you may not even need to bring the power cord with you. Also, because you don&#x27;t have a million attachments to worry about its easy to throw in a bag and not worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to the QT4014 is that if I want to shape up my beard and get those nice clean lines i could need to get a secondary trimmer for that, but this wasn&#x27;t advertised as a trimmer to do that so I can&#x27;t really complain with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a multipurpose grooming tool this isn&#x27;t for you, but if you only need a great trimmer than this should be your first choice</li>
    <li> it is good and easy to use. nice purchase.</li>
    <li> I have owned many different trimmers and clippers in the past decade years. This is hands down the best beard trimmer for heavy stubble and trimming it evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable guard on this lets u change the trim size by very small amounts so u can find the ideal length to the millimeter (very important for me; i like to trim my goatee area 1mm shorter than my sides because of the differences in density of my beard hair in these areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the size you are trimming at is clearly visible on the spin dial (on other adjustable guard trimmers, it is sometimes hard to see what length u have set. Which leads to cutting shorter than intended sometimes...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the guard is locked securily in place (in some cheaper models of phillips adjustable trimmers, if you press too firmly down on your skin, you can move the guard setting to a smaller length and messup your beard!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are rounded edges so that when you use the trimmer with no gaurd to outline ur beard line, it doesnt hurt or cut you.&lt;br /&gt;The guard itself is also smooth and doesnt needlessly stick out with points like many common guards do. So you don&#x27;t stab yourself with the guard while trimming... and u can also trim more evenly the hard to reach areas like mustache and under the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for days for a trimmer that would allow me to perfect the heavy stubble look (5~7mm). All my past trimmers cut unevenly at heavy stubble or higher gaurd settings so I would get patches of hair noticibly longer than other hair, and lots of missed hairs. I was even willing to spend $200 on a trimmer if it would do a great job at cutting beard hair evenly. But it turns out that the best trimmer ended up being this model, which is relatively cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With most trimmers, 1~3mm will give an even cut. However the longer you want your beard trimmed (5+mm) the harder it is to get even because the hairs bend down and most guards do not pick them up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Using this trimmer the guard is smooth and not bulky so you can trim ur beard in a circular manner to get the hard to cut hairs and the ones that get bent down. Using this circular motion I am able to get very nice results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you should use this trimmer to define the neck line of your beard, but you should still have a razer to trim the bulk of the neckbeard for a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record I also own the &amp;#34;phillips norelco multigroom 3100&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;wahl 9854-600 all in one trimmer.&amp;#34; This trimmer beats both of them in everything, except i will admit the wahl seems to have more power to its blades trim speed, and i think the wahl is slimmer which I like better. In my experience wahl trimmers break easily, and phillips last a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this trimmer could be improved by being a bit slimmer and straight instead of bent. But as far as all the other trimmers i researched and have owned, this is as good as it gets for heavy stubble!</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this trimmer.  He even recommended it to&lt;br /&gt;our hair dresser.  She was very interested in this.</li>
    <li> Small and light trimmer that is convenient when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lifetime is impressive.</li>
    <li> was a gift for son, he really likes it says it does what he wants it to do, slender and fits into palm of hand easily.</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer ever, it is fast, sharp and the baterry lasts for ever. it charges in 1 hour, and i havent recharged it in 2 months!. Easy to clean and water proof for cleaning.</li>
    <li> It does a nice job trimming beards.  The cutting unit is a little thinner than others and it requires more frequent cleaning.  But it is very easy to clean, holds a charge, light, and does an all-around good job.  If you are looking for a simple trimmer, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Works as described.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has so far done just about everything I&#x27;ve asked it to do. I love the one piece unit with the various adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;Ansel.</li>
    <li> Keeps a good charge and shaves an even beard. Can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Charged well. Cuts well. Only con: feels a touch on the light &#x27;cheap&#x27; side. Wish they manufactured this with a sleek metal look. Otherwise great for the price and ease of use.</li>
    <li> works good.  Need to get used to speed/level settings.  Very nice product</li>
    <li> This trimmer has performed extremely well for me over the past 8 months of ownership.  The guard is very easy to use and the adjustments are equally as simple.  Very compact and lightweight.  The thing I cannot understand is the internal battery...I believe that since the initial charge, I have only charged it one time in the 8 months that I&#x27;ve owned it - this thing lasts forever!  I shave at least every other day with it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t come quite close enough to my skin with the guard off.  I like being left with a rough sandpaper-like stubble, but this leaves a bit longer.  Definitely more than my last trimmer.  I hate to dock it the star though because it&#x27;s not really designed to be a razor.</li>
    <li> arrived safe and sound</li>
    <li> This was perfect to keep certain beard length, exactly what i needed. i use this once a week (3 minutes) and the battery took several weeks to die</li>
    <li> Not a close shave as i expected</li>
    <li> Battery lasts forever! Well worth the $</li>
    <li> Is an adjustable height feature really necessary? My last beard trimmer had several attachable height gages. I may have tried a couple at first but once I settled on the one I liked I never switched. The only application I can think of for where an adjustable height might be useful is if the device shared by a bunch of guys who have beards from stubble to long. I do not like the adjustable height as much as a fixed height gage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 months and it still trims as good as the day it arrived. If you have sensitive skin and want something to give you a close shave I would recommend getting this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY: I charge it after every 4 trims. I&#x27;ve never had it run out of life on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING: The trim guard pulls right off and is easy to clean. The hairs really don&#x27;t build up much and I can usually clean it off just by wiping a tissue or finger across it.</li>
    <li> Love the battery life on this one.</li>
    <li> It holds a charge a lot better than my previous ones. I was concerned the guide may cause some uneven shave but it actually works well. I deduct a star because it gets a lot of hair beneath the actual razor so to clean you have to take it apart to get the hair out, which is time consuming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this beard trimmer.  It works well, holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time and is easy to clean.  I also like that it can be used with or without the cord.</li>
    <li> This trimmer replaces the one I&#x27;ve had for quite some time now. works just as good with a longer charge &amp; slightly smaller to boot!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, though the neck bend makes it a bit harder on the wrist. My only issue, and this may apply to all trimmers (this is my first, so I don&#x27;t know) is that a fair bit of the hair cuttings land as far as 18&amp;#34; away, which leaves a messy sink after. I use a trash can to keep the process cleaner, but some hair lands directly below, so it&#x27;s not a perfect setup.</li>
    <li> Awesome little trimmer and holds a charge at amazing level just make sure you charge it to the fullest when you open it. Mine lasted almost a year on initial charge when I sported an &#x27;iron man&#x27; looking goatee :). This makes it a nice for traveling. The little angle in the grip (as someone reviewed as negative point) is actually very handy should you decide to use this as a personal groomer, works great for &#x27;man-scaping&#x27;. Huge plus is that should you run out of juice it will work while plugged in the wall - many of the new units don&#x27;t have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they could drop the blades down to &#x27;zero&#x27; so it could be used a barber shop level trimmers but that is asking too much from this line of product. Placing the top blade piece back in the handle after cleaning can be little tricky as some plastic parts look fragile, so go slow and don&#x27;t use much force to click back in place. It doesn&#x27;t require that much detailed cleaning so not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price compared to other expensive and clunky units.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted me to have the stubble look so we gave this a try.  Works as designed but wish it would trim even a bit more closely.</li>
    <li> Loving it, just a bit hard to clean it, but thats not a product problem</li>
    <li> Pro: Many level adjustments, long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Uneven trimming (consistent during multiple uses), blades could still use oil despite manual saying it doesn&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Perfect trim, not pulling pinching or biting.  Easy adjust.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Although it works very will, It&#x27;s not Washable !!!&lt;br /&gt;How is that !! it&#x27;s a breadtrimmer ! it should be washable Philips !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know until I received the box, so honesty I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a friend.</li>
    <li> Got this for my SO and I&#x27;m really glad I did, he says it&#x27;s easy to use and now he looks more even dashing than ever :)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a cheap Whal that I bought from walmart. This trimmer is fantastic! Its really nice how the guard adjusts in half increments and that you can pop it of for close trimming and cleaning. The charge on it seems to last forever but then again I only trim my beard once or twice a month. Easy to clean and is great for traveling because of its contained form factor and charge. I clean it every use (real easy btw) and it cuts as good as the day I bought it (3 months ago). I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a relatively low cost, yet feature packed shaver.</li>
    <li> I have always went cheap on these things in the past, and they never last. And they pull the hair off your face. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;This one is GREAT! Even without the guard, it just glides across the skin leaving a very close, consistent shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more messy than the previous norelco that I had which uses a vacuum system.  This one slings whiskers everywhere.  It does hold a decent charge and cuts good which is why the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Returned this trimmer for refund. Adjustable guide actually pushed hair away from trimmer blade..</li>
    <li> After months of research I finally decided to go with this trimmer, for several reasons: the wider array of adjustments on the lower end, the simple design with solid feature set and nothing I didn&#x27;t need, and fast charging/long charge time. After three months of use, I&#x27;m very satisfied. The lower end adjustments let me add some definition to my scruff, and the shape of the trimmer works nicely - though it did feel a bit weird in the hand at first. It&#x27;s also fairly quite, which is appreciated.</li>
    <li> Got for kids. They really like it.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for husband and he hasn&#x27;t used it yet but it&#x27;s exactly what he was looking for</li>
    <li> This product worked well for a little under 1 year, then one day while shaving the clipper teeth stopped moving back and forth. I took the clipper part off, and the electronics inside still worked and spun around the bit that moves the clippers. But every time I put it back together, it would only work for a fraction of a second before the clippers stopped moving again. At this point I was half shaved and looked a bit like a fool. Luckily I had an old plug-in clipper around meant for cutting hair that did a good enough job on the remaining stubble.</li>
    <li> Great product works well nice adjustable settings.</li>
    <li> awesome and they do the job, strong enough for a thick beard guy.</li>
    <li> I had an old philips model from two years ago - it was &#x27;wet and dry.&#x27; This one seems to be dry only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic and i love it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing battery life, close trim for your stubble-style, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Great item - perfect size</li>
    <li> Works great. Great stubble trimmer. 20 length settings up to 3/8&amp;#34;. Long battery life. Inexpensive - this is all you need. Don&#x27;t waste your cash on more expensive shavers. Nice &amp; small so good for travel. Facial hair grows/lays in different directions so you have to shave against the grain accordingly for an even trim. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this is awesome. It does what it is supposed to do. I also stopped having so much acne since I stopped shaving and started using this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Short Answer -- Works as advertised.  Long Answer -- I keep a beard year round and change the length based on seasons, weather and mood.  My previous trimmer had 3 settings and it was impossible to get it to the right length.  This trimmer is excellent. It has 20 different lengths and allows me to blend my beard into my side burns by slightly increasing the length.  If you are looking for a great trimmer, look no further.</li>
    <li> This trimmer really does what I need.  On the closest setting it does leave just a little bit of growth, but then again it&#x27;s a trimmer.  It&#x27;s not advertised as a razor.  Very happy with mine.</li>
    <li> Not as close a trim as possible but is great for shaping. The guard does not come loose</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for 40 years, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had. No extra parts to loose, trimmer has 20 settings, one for everyone, just turn the dial. It also cuts very smooth and fast and the shape of the head feels perfect. Uses the NiMh batteries not the cheep nicads. Charges in just a hour and will run on the cord if needed. And not that it matters it looks good to !  Amazon has the best price by far, Beat even Ebay, this was a great purchase, very happy.  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;                                                                                                                                  Follow up---I am still waiting for it to need a charge, it just keeps running ! I use it a couple of times a week and it&#x27;s still running full speed going for 2 months now, WOW ! THE BEST TRIMMER I EVER HAD !</li>
    <li> Works well, no complaints. Good price</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t pay anywhere near list price on this, the sale price is half list price. From what I gather discounted sales are frequent.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the cutting length can be changed without changing blade guards. It has multiple settings from stubble to about 3/8 of an inch. I use it for both beard and sideburn trims between haircuts. The blade guard fits into grooves instead of snapping in so it will be less prone to breaking. Nice solid feel as it trims.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner.  Factory packaging.  Fully charged in a short time.  Works great with lots of settings.</li>
    <li> Been about 3 months so far. Works great. can set down low with no bites as of yet.</li>
    <li> Its an ok trimmer. I liked my Remington a little better before i dropped it. Still, its worth the $</li>
    <li> I use this to shave with every couple of days.  I trim my goatee on 3.5 and shave with it on the lowest setting (0.5).  I tried 3 other electric beard trimmers before I found this one.  This is the one you are looking for!</li>
    <li> As a Black man with a curly haired beard (50&#x27;s) this is a great product. I can easily get any beard style I like - and the five o&#x27;clock shadow is a WINNER! (set at 1.5-2.0)</li>
    <li> Great razor, good for stubble and large amount of hair. Easy to keep and clean. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works well enough, holds a charge for a long time, works with my other Norelco power plugs, and has a lot of adjustable heights. Does NOT painfully plug hairs like my old trimmer - much nicer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two complaints are:&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call them slick sides, but they arn&#x27;t grippy - have dropped it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;My beard hair is quite thick and wirey; the guard works well enough if you are after stubble, but I like my beard a bit longer and it takes a bunch of passes to get all the hair in the guard and trimmed and even then it misses some. If the guard had wider slots it would work better for me but probably not as good for others. It still beats my old trimmer which pulled hairs.</li>
    <li> works really well and holds a charge for a very long time.  only issue is that if you have longer beard hair, it might spray the hair around making a small mess.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, works like a charm and the battery lasts a while.</li>
    <li> dead after four months............as a beard trimmer three stars.........it was alright putting an edge on my mustache and keeping my beard at a medium length..........one day it up and died.......I must have missed the part in the advertisement telling me it was actually a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Terrific and dirt cheap.  Never been able to keep my beard trimmed for 20 years until I got this thing!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Also very QUIET.</li>
    <li> Length guide is cheap plastic and does not cut evenly.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did, pay extra for better quality.</li>
    <li> A great trimmer that does exactly what it was design to do and it does it well. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very powerful, I have a thick beard and this cuts right through it. Perhaps a little too powerful. Be careful if you use it on... um, places besides your face.</li>
    <li> I replaced another Norelco beard trimmer. I keep my beard very short, near stubble. This does a nice job of trimming it short, and it is fairly even. The charge seems to last for three or four weeks. It only takes an hour or so to charge back up. I prefer the trimmer head on the old product that I used as it was a little wider, adjustable, and a little more comfortable on my face. However I&#x27;ve gotten used to this pretty nicely. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. don&#x27;t like the adjustable head. Doesn&#x27;t cut body hair evenly. Had to go over many times. Good for face / beard</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for over a month now, and although the product description states that the lowest cut level is .5mm, you really have to work an area many times to get that result because although he guard is set low enough, the actual cutting blade on the trimmer is recessed too far. Therefore, working to achieve the advertised .5mm stubble takes time and exacts irritation on the skin. I owned an older model Norelco and it enabled me to achieve the .5mm stubble easily. Otherwise, the product appears to be as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is great for exactly the name of the trimmer.  This is primarily designed to use for creating the stubble look and in that it excels.  For a short beard, it also excels.  The maximum length setting however is 5 so if you have a beard longer than this, you&#x27;re not going to like it.  For a short beard, you will be very happy. The automated up and down of the device trimmer is exceptional.  What I don&#x27;t understand is why Conair is not making this same trimmer with a larger setting allowance for longer beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trim guard flips back and out of the way so you can use the bare trimmer to get around those tight places like your lips and nose. The snap up trimmer allows for easy clean up and also the trimmer is easy to remove if you want to clean even further. Conair even provides a tube of oil to lube the blades periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend it but would recommend Conair consider making a version for a longer beard.</li>
    <li> Really, hardly any directions needed to use this.  It charged in less than an hour and the built in settings are great for someone like me who tends to lose the pieces to other kinds.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t chafe, cleans quickly.  For a full beard it would be impractical but nice for sideburns, mustache, and eyebrows.  The carrying case is a simple pull-string bag that just fits over the unit.</li>
    <li> Trimmer died on first charge.  The battery got really hot and it wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge after that.  I&#x27;m going to contact the company to see about a replacement.  I bought this for myself and as a gift for a friend but now i&#x27;m wishing i hadn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Batteries drain out even on storing it fully charged .. Within 2-3 days. I have to use it most of the times in plugged mode :(</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected! It comes already charged out of the box. Clean up is easy, simply run the head under running water and you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> It is the first beard trimmer I buy. It is working very well for me. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> This is a great beard and stubble trimmer with a wide range of  settings. Best of all the settings are manually controled. I had a Conair i-Stubble which I loved/hated. It cut beautifully and also had a nice range of settings. But, it&#x27;s plagued with problems. Every once in a while it went bonkers and wouldn&#x27;t stay in any setting...it&#x27;s electronically controller. It finally wouldn&#x27;t give me anything but the lowest or the highest setting.  It also was not great at detail so I had another trimmer for that. I also had to recharge it periodically for 16 hours or it didn&#x27;t know whatit was doing. I like the Norelco mostly because I can set the height with a manual control knowing that if I set it at a certain height, it will stay there. It cuts very nicely (I don&#x27;t have a thick beard by the way, but if you do,  you may have a different experience. The Norelco is a little better for detailing...like trimming your mustache. It&#x27;s got a smaller head. But I still need a smaller trimmer for that. In the end I&#x27;m very happy with the Norelco because it just works...every time.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement for my lost trimmer.  I am very pleased with the adjustable cut and close cut features.</li>
    <li> Works awesome , just sometimes you have to work at it to get an even cut. I totally would but it again though</li>
    <li> I wish they made these better but works good</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed! I have had multiple trimmers in the past, but, never one that could really get the stubble look down for me. This one did the trick! Great battery life as well! Very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Nice and small ;)  super again !!!</li>
    <li> I have had many different trimmers over the years, (I am now 64 yrs old to put &#x27;many&#x27; in perspective), and this trimmer is the best design I have used. The best feature is being able to change lengths with the turn of a dial rather than having the 20 different attachments it would take to equal the different settings built in to this trimmer. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son to keep his beard neat. He likes it very much and found it very easy to use. My husband was so impressed he wants one like it for himself. Tons easier than managing all those combs etc for changing beard length. Just flip the switch and you can adjust the blade to whatever length you like.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> It takes me forever to trim my beard with this horrible trimmer. This is junk, I have to go over the same area 3 time to get a good cut. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Awesome beard trimmer. It helps keep my beard nice and stubble. Great price and luckily I had a coupon clipped, so it was even more inexpensive. No need to spend on $50-$100 beard trimmer, in my opinion, seriously. This gets the job done enough with great settings on how thick and short you want your beard to be.</li>
    <li> Before receiving this trimmer, I&#x27;d been using the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco QT4070]] with the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode and the integrated vacuum.  I prefer this model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has more length settings over a shorter range (20 vs 18, with a maximum length of 10mm vs 18mm).  The longer settings on the QT4070 were never any use to me -- if I tried to tidy up my sideburns with the longer setting, no hair ever made it to the blade, since the \\&quot;contour-following\\&quot; comb wouldn&#x27;t lift it up high enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model lacks the integrated vacuum, but I never thought much of that feature.  It didn&#x27;t catch all of the hair trimmings, so there was still a pile of cut hair in the sink, but I still had to clean out the little vacuum compartment (easily done, but an extra step).  What&#x27;s more, the door latch on the vacuum compartment eventually broke -- so that&#x27;s one less thing to break here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model lacks the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode, but I never noticed a difference between \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; and \\&quot;normal\\&quot; mode, beyond the pitch of the whine.  Maybe if I was trying to shave heads of new recruits to boot camp in under ten seconds, I would have seen a difference.  So, bonus: you&#x27;re not paying for a largely useless feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet run the battery all the way down, but despite the difference in battery technology between this and the QT4070 (NiMH vs. Lithium Ion), the published charge &amp; run times are the same.  Knowing how manufacturers spec their products, I&#x27;m betting the run time on the QT4070 is measured in normal mode, not turbo mode, so if you habitually run it in turbo (because honestly, even if I can&#x27;t tell a difference, OF COURSE I&#x27;m going to turn it on \\&quot;full blast\\&quot;), you may be getting less.  Either way, this will easily last more than a week without a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a really good trimmer for a really good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and easy to use. I have several other trimmers and find this to be the best.</li>
    <li> I think the basic design, if you are going for a short stubble beard, is not great.  It takes a long time.  You have to find the hair direction all over your face.  You have to get it even by going over and over all areas.  The comb part may not be sharp, as some have pointed out, but it is still uncomfortable and the gaps are big enough to catch your lip or edge of your mouth.  It adjusts decently and cuts decently, and I know this is the basic design of most of this type of unit, but someone needs to sit down and re-think the entire product group.  They took what a barber uses to trim the back of your neck and turned it into a beard trimmer.  That just doesn&#x27;t work.  I hear the one from Braun is a different design and, at least the people I know, really like it.  This is OK for the money, but as it stands, not a very good product and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about two weeks and I am  very pleased.  Using it is so simple ,no attachements to mess with and a very accurate numerical settings. I really like the  ability to have a great looking beard with no effort on my part. The price is very reasonable compared to other trimmers. Good trimmer, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> What a great trimmer. This trimmer charges within a half hour and stays charged for extended periods. I only trim my beard every 1-2 months so I can testify that this trimmer has a good amount of power. My only complaint is that you have to keep using the brush that is provided in the kit to clean the guard out. For me, this happen about 6 times on average while trimming. This product has lasted over a year for me with no issues.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now and am very impressed. You can use it for weeks maybe even a month before you have to plug in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet, easy to adjust and does the job!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this with a caveat; my previous &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34; was a piece of junk; a $12-$13 Wahl cordless trimmer that would invariably leave long hairs all over my beard which would need to be manually trimmed with tiny scissors - just did a pretty terrible job on keeping my beard actually trimmed. That, and the little plastic guards are easy to misplace/lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco GT4014/42 (catchy name??) fixes all of these problems. No guards to lose, and most importantly, it didn&#x27;t leave any goofy long hairs. Are there better ones on the market? Who knows. But not having to use oil to keep the blades lubricated, and a one pass trim keeping me looking less like a crazy person and more like a guy with a beard is win in my book. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer my husband has owned.  Great choice.</li>
    <li> Took a bit to get used to it but it cuts well and is light weight.</li>
    <li> Nice unit - does the job and holds a charge tons longer than my previous trimmer..</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for over 50 years this is the best by far. It meets all my expectations and then some.</li>
    <li> Great battery life. Trims nicely.</li>
    <li> excellent product , works very well almost foolproof</li>
    <li> Its good. Nothing special. But good</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve had two or three other brands and this one is so far superior it&#x27;s almost in a different category. The length guard is easy to use and works well, the trimmer is very easy to clean and the battery seems to last forever. Phillips Norelco should get some kind of award for this product.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer! Holds a charge for a long time and does a good job. Nice sharp blades.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver! Works as expected!</li>
    <li> This is a really good item for the price. I&#x27;ve owned mine for a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I can reliably trim my beard down to stubble. It should be noted however that it can&#x27;t really trim any further than stubble. If you&#x27;re planning on getting it to replace being able to shave down to the skin, this isn&#x27;t the right product. But otherwise, it&#x27;s very nice. It trims very easily, and very quick. Definitely beats the heck out of shaving! The only real complaint I have about this product is that hair tends to get all over the place after using it. However, it&#x27;s a fairly easy clean up, and not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> This is definitely cool!  Helps me keep an optimum beard length without expending large amount of time.  Easy to use with great results.  The price is good.</li>
    <li> Solid trimmer at a good price</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good price, well made. I like the variety of settings and the ability to trim sideburns .</li>
    <li> WOW on the battery life and charge time but cuts a litter higher then my older model</li>
    <li> It works as intended. Very nice and easy to use. Price is not bad either.</li>
    <li> I use it regurally - great trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. Very nice setup for switch on handle and adjustment of blade length. Cleans easily - just blow it off.</li>
    <li> Perfect. The item came as described.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, excellent shave. No frills or interchangeable heads. 100% of the cost goes towards the quality of the shave.</li>
    <li> It is great, very easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the older model and stuck with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product and I&#x27;ll recomend it to anyone who wants a clean beard and trim.</li>
    <li> Works very well on the beard with no attachments needed. Very compact and quiet compared to an older model that still works well.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this mustache/beard trimmer! Contrary to some of the more doubtful reviews on here, I&#x27;ll mention that the Philips Norelco QT4014/42 is a fantastically precise trimmer. First, the cutting element is extremely crisp and very safe: though I took the guard off to edge my sideburns this morning, this shaver did not irritate my skin in the slightest, and gave the most clean trim I&#x27;d had in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Second, that guard is very efficient and simple to use. Unlike other guards (which sometimes only cover the top of a blade set, resulting in an inherently uneven trim), this guard completely encapsulates the blades, making it impossible to trim your mustache/beard/stubble unevenly.&lt;br /&gt;Third, the overall design is simply awesome. The bend in this shaver makes it easy to get at those hard-to-trim places, such as right under the ears (below the lower jaw) and the entire neck area. Furthermore, I found that removing the helpful guard allows for a close shave nearly comparable to a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this sucker holds a charge like nobody&#x27;s business! It had a useable charge right out of the box, and even after I plugged it in to charge for the first time (as you should right when you start using it), it took less than an hour to gain a full charge. Sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this trimmer. Give it a try, and see why for yourself.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer, great size for traveling, id say it has a learning curve, i trimmed one of my sideburns and came out fine.  Went to trim the other side and Zap !!!! I messed it up. So i had to shave off both sideburns , my fault not the trimers , it will grow back !!  Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for a few weeks now. I&#x27;m very satisfied with Norelco products. They are well made, they hold a charge for what seems to be forever, easy to clean and easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the simplicity of this trimmer, i can now trim in a couple of minutes and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. My only issue with it is that hairs go everywhere and I always have to clean up the entire sink when I&#x27;m done but I guess that goes for any trimmer out there.</li>
    <li> This thing is great!  For those of you looking at minimum settings, it works well without the guard.  It cuts very close compared to others, 0.5mm as the discription says, and it does NOT cut or irritate the skin without the guard.  I&#x27;m pretty aggressive with it sometimes and it just doesn&#x27;t scrape like my other trimmer does (it&#x27;s still metal against your skin obviously, but it hasn&#x27;t cut me or left marks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as far as battery life goes, I&#x27;m writing this review because today was the first time the orange light came on indicating the battery is getting low.  It is also 6 weeks since I received it and charged it.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 2-3 minutes 5 days a week and it still didn&#x27;t die on me, it just calmly flashed at me to let me know I should charge it up.  I guess that&#x27;s just about the 90 minutes they advertise, but as far as holding a charge goes that exceeds my expectations and you should consider battery life a positive for this one.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought I was ordering.  Easy to use, does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Easy even trimming with 20 different settings.  Hold a charge for a very long time and is easy to clean.  Best trimmer I have had so far.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair well, and trimmer noise is relatively quiet.  The size fits well in my hand and easily light in weight. I actually use the beard trimmer to cut my hair (military style, high and tight) because of the closeness.  The guard adjustment is easy to use, and the loud &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; enable me to switch guard length without having to look down at it.  I gently clean and lubricate mine with a synthetic gun oil every 5 cuts.</li>
    <li> I decided in the early summer - shortly after retiring - that I would grow my beard out, something I had not done for about 17 years.  And I knew I would need a good trimmer.  I read all the reviews, asked my neighbor what he used, considered how reliable my Philips Norelco electric shaver had been over the years, and purchased this trimmer.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Works wonderfully, plenty of settings, comfortable, very affordable.  Excellent product....</li>
    <li> bought a few lemons before this and this was the cheapest and best. have had 10 shaves and it&#x27;s still not out of battery. super fast on grooming. easy cleaning. awesome product.</li>
    <li> Pleased with my purchase. However, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut my beard as closely as I would prefer.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer I have owned.  I keep my grille short and the adjustment works great to get the right length and once set, one can just run the device against the beard grain as the manual recommends and it&#x27;s done.  Works great on eyebrows too.</li>
    <li> excellent item. works as advertised. easy to use and versatile. Cuts smoothly and does not nick or pull hairs.</li>
    <li> This is a really good trimmer at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have annoyingly sensitive skin so I frequently got ingrown hairs from shaving. Prior to buying this trimmer, my electric shaver would pull a lot of my hair as I shaved making for a uncomfortable shaving experience and leaving me with lots of ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer helped stop that. The guard can be removed and the blades will not cut skin so I used this first to trim all my hair down to a super short length. After doing that I use my electric shaver which now works fine and no longer pulls my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batter seems to last forever and chargers quickly so that&#x27;s a plus although it doesn&#x27;t take me long to shave so I don&#x27;t know how necessary it is to have a battery that lasts almost an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of length settings though I mostly use 2mm or less. The guard can be safely removed for an even closer shave (which I prefer to do over using it at the .5mm setting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line this is a great trimmer and you can even almost use it an electric shaver. I would highly recommend purchasing one.</li>
    <li> Great product, and great price. I never have too long beard any more!</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Have been using it regularly for the last 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Usage - 10-15 mins a week for the last 3 months &amp; it has been running still with just the initial full charge to the battery. No hassle operation &amp; easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this to have that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.  Works like a charm.  Feels well made</li>
    <li> Have had for 3 weeks and still on first charge. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Solid trimmer for a decent price I would give it a 4.5</li>
    <li> Its OK does the job but takes longer than my other beard trimmer. I have a Go-T and have to use 2 different settings to get a nice even cut. One setting #9 to go against the grain of the hair and #5-6 to go with.&lt;br /&gt;The big conn is all the trimmers have these wide teeth. The should be a fine tooth comb for beards with any length. Havent these guys figured it out yet.  When you beard is longer it matter. But short stubble it doesnt.</li>
    <li> It replaced a trimmer I had for 20 years.  I figured it was time to get up to date.  It works well on my beard length and I like that I can remove the length adjuster for close trimming and simply re-insert it without losing my chosen length adjustment.  I no longer have to remember and count the clicks, simply take it off and put it back.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Had always used Wahl trimmers.  Needed a new one, so decided to try this.  It&#x27;s extremely sharp compared to the Wahls I&#x27;ve used, probably because of the titanium blades.  To use the Norelco, though, requires some getting used to.  With the guide on, the razor must be held at an unusual angle, but once you adapt to it, no problem.  The nice thing about the guide is that there are no sharp, pointy ends to jab into your skin; there&#x27;s just one guide that&#x27;s adjustable from the razor body.  It&#x27;s hard to describe without seeing and using it, but it gives the best trim of any of these types of razors I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Used it to trim beard.. didn&#x27;t tug and was easy to clean. After letting it dry completely per the instructions, I put it away and a week later plugged it in to charge overnight. Turned it on the next day and nothing - it wouldn&#x27;t come on plugged in or not, even though the green light was on solid indicating it was fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exchanged it for another unit, used the new one successfully once. A week later, went to use it again and the SAME exact problem. Charged overnight, green light on solid but still it was dead.</li>
    <li> This was the best shaving machine i ever had, the trimming levels are so accurate, you can really feel the deference when you set it from 1 to 1.5, product quality is also supereb</li>
    <li> This could be useful for travel. It&#x27;s lightweight, and a fresh charge stays fully strong for a full shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charger works on both North American and European (220) voltages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade assembly can be popped out to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t recommend this for daily use. Much better, for 2-3x more money, is a professional-grade clippers, such as the [[ASIN:B000BBF4L8 Andis 22315 Excel 2-Speed Professional Clipper]] or similar clippers. I have used a pair of Excel clippers for over a decade to shave my beard/stubble, and it&#x27;s much more reliable than I fear this Philips Norelco QT4014/42 will be. Compared to the Excel, the Philips Norelco takes twice as long to shave, pulled my hairs several times, and is flimsy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned lots of shavers and trimmers over the years. I&#x27;ve never found a shaver that can reliably give a close shave as well as a disposable razor. But, in order for the razor to work, facial hair needs to be fairly short. If I let it go three or more days, I have to use something to cut it back to stubble, before the razor can cut it close. For that, this stubble trimmer works okay. Just turn the comb to the \\&quot;zero\\&quot; length and it gets rid of everything but the last bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better on my goatee. I set it to \\&quot;five\\&quot; for my goatee and to \\&quot;three\\&quot; for my mustache, and then, every few days I&#x27;ll turn this on and run it through a few times, and I&#x27;m good to go. It works great, and keeps my goatee manageable and my moustache neat. It&#x27;s got a few nice touches, too, like the rotating knob for adjusting the comb length, that you can adjust from the front or the back. It comes with a handy bag that fits the trimmer nicely - I wish that it was a bit bigger so that I could fit the plug in there too for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to recharge, and, while I haven&#x27;t timed it, seems to hold its charge for a while. I can use it every few days for a few weeks on a single charge.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco QT4014 trimmer is similar to other models on the market but has several tweaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s a bit smaller and lighter than most and is much easier to grip and manipulate. The weight is well-balanced and it feels good in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length adjusting mechanism is very ergonomic with silicone strips and the wheel is accessible from the front and back so that both the thumb and forefinger can be used to to turn it very intuitively. The recesses also accomodate the fingers while using the trimmer. This is an outstanding feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, the on-off mechanism is a ridged, sliding panel that is effortless. Again, very intuitive and a vast improvement on similar models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting length is adjustable in 20 increments from 0.5 mm to 10 mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb stays put while in use but is much easier to remove and insert for cleaning than is usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges quickly, has an indicator light, and the converter is interchangeable with several other Philips Norelco trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is slightly louder than average though not nearly in the loudest quintile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the comb and blade are easily removed for washing, the unit itself cannot be exposed to water. As with most similar devices, frequent cleaning is critical for good performance and being able to rinse off the cavity under the blade would be a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming blade is 1.5\\&quot; wide which works well in a limited and sharply-curved area such as the face (as marketed) but of course it wouldn&#x27;t be as ideal for other body parts. It&#x27;s not intended as a shaver, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very nice little little beard and stubble trimmer that stands out from similar models for ease of use and handling.</li>
    <li> I prefer the waterproofed body trimmers because they offer more flexibility, but if you only want to use it on your beard, and dont need to take it to the shower, this is a solid choice. If youre looking for the little details, I&#x27;d get a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the closest setting it will leave you with a bit of 5 o&#x27;clock stubble. On the longest setting it leaves it a few inches. Its fast, but doesnt have a receptacle for the hair, so you may find yourself clearing it frequently, and having you partner get on you to make sure the sink is clean. It also doesnt include a stand, which means it takes up a lot of room on the sink lying down whilst charging. Another potential sticking point for you partner. But it does trim fast and efficiently.</li>
    <li> Very pleased and it holds a charge well</li>
    <li> Excellent Beard Trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my beard for the last 40+ years and this is by far the easiest beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used. Blades are sharp and protected, and the attached beard comb helps to keep everything lined-up and looking neat. I&#x27;d otherwise comment on the battery charge, but I&#x27;ve yet to run out of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From its ease of movement to cleaning the blades, this trimmer is all you need to keep your beard neat and trim looking. And given my experience with Norelco products, I expect years of service from this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product really did a number on the jungle in my nether regions. Thanks Norelco, &amp;#34;the best a man can get&amp;#34; ..wait nevermind that&#x27;s Gillette</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Been using it for a month.  I like that, even without a comb on it, it will not cut or nick</li>
    <li> Nice product - but make sure you test a spot before using for the first time.  My son trimmed his beard almost off (LOL) and wasn&#x27;t happy.  Oh well - Mom didn&#x27;t really like the beard anyway.</li>
    <li> When it comes to electric shavers it&#x27;s hard to find the perfect trimmer. This trimmer from Philips is one of the sharper electric trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. It cuts through tough beard hair like it was nothing, without any pulling. The adjustable guide is solid and it cuts very short at the lowest setting. It&#x27;s important not to take the guide off as shaving direct with the blades can result in cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver holds its charge well and it has a sold adapter which makes charging easy. My only gripe about it is that it tends to make more of a mess than some of the other razors I&#x27;ve tried. The blades are so sharp and move so fast that it tends to scatter the hair a bit more than some of the other shavers I&#x27;ve used (and there&#x27;s no catch basin or vacuum with this uint). Still, if you are looking for a solid affordable razor that performs well at varying lengths, this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> Satisfied. I should have gotten one of these a long time ago. Trying to pick one was kind of silly, with higher-priced ones having things like vacuums. But this is pretty well adjustable and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> does not trim mustache well</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Nothing really fancy but it does the job quite well and keeps whatever whiskers you want to wear at their subjectively optimum length.</li>
    <li> All my bearded folk, look no further. This trimmer has everything you could need. strong battery life that is rechargable. It has different settings for lengths to adjust and style the way you want. It also is pretty to look at, and cut really evenly. though there is a limit to its length setting so those with a very long beard this may not be the best option for you. perhaps some hair clippers would be ideal if your beard is to long for this(over 1&amp;#34; i guess).</li>
    <li> High quality razor. The battery has very good life. My last Norelco that was over 15 years old still held a long charge, however it was left behind after vacation. So I got in a pinch and needed a razor right away bought a cheap one at small discount store. To say the least it was a waste of money. Bought another Norelco it seems to be built as good as the last one.</li>
    <li> Wow I love this trimmer.  I used Remington trimmers for 20 years - after my last one died I tried this and boy do I wish my old one died sooner.  Perfect for trimming my beard and the detachable guide (slides right off) makes this a great edge trimmer too.  I have never had one that trimed this good.  Easy 5 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> perfect for my beard. Trims to the adjusted size.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer but the guide is rounded then curved and I find it quite useless.  My search continues for a good beard trimmer</li>
    <li> I have used many versions of a Norelco beard trimmer.  This one has the best motor and battery life so far.  It cuts very well without the guide (the plastic part on top that you can &#x27;dial&#x27; to different lengths).  The problem it shares with other models is that the plastic guard really does not work very well to help cut at a length.  It requires you make multiple passes over the same area.  Without the guard, I can control the length quite easily.  And it does it quickly and well.  I recommend this model over others.</li>
    <li> I loved it! The best trimmer i ever had</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. Works perfectly. Highly reccommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer. Wish it allowed the hair to grow a little longer.</li>
    <li> No problem, worked right out of the box. Charged up fine. Shaves great. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because it claimed to trim down to &amp;#34;1/64 inch (.05mm)&amp;#34;. False. After being unable to get a close trim, I noticed the box says it trims down to &amp;#34;1/32 inch stubble&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s twice the length! Even the trimmer on the back of my $40 braun series 3 foil shaver trims much closer.</li>
    <li> Works Great. The 1st trimmer made me happy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I did alot of shopping and comparing.  I love this model because it has so many different options for length.  I have a very heavy thick beard, and it has never had any issues no matter the length I want to cut.  Has a strong motor, and the battery life is very very good.  Could not be happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> works as expected, nothing special though. works great overseas too as the power adapter can convert the voltage. great buy.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a trimmer that really left stubble, just like I had shaved a couple days ago. This Norelco has the closest trim I&#x27;ve ever had, and the settings are significantly more fine than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only stubble trimmer I&#x27;ve ever liked. There&#x27;s so much control!</li>
    <li> Really easy to use, long lasting battery, really strong. Super happy with it.  Settings are soo easy to manage, i have it set to 3.5 mm for the beard, then i take off the top cover and shave the neck.  You can literally shave fast as hell when your late for work (EVERYDAY).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But In a perfect world, i would make the following changes to this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.make it waterproof (pain in the ass to clean right now).&lt;br /&gt;2. Come with a car charger  (doesn&#x27;t right now, also if it was a usb 2.0 input, than it would make our lives a lot easier and not have to carry that stupid cord everywhere, it doesn&#x27;t fit in the pouch that it came with it.)&lt;br /&gt;3. trap the hairs that get shaved, (right now hairs get everywhere in the bathroom.)&lt;br /&gt;4. come with a nose trimmer (lower end norelco model came with it, why couldn&#x27;t this one?? )</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, holds a charge, and the gradations for length give you a wide range of beard/stubble length. I settled on the 3.5 setting and it produces the unifom length I want every time. Because my beard grows in varied directions, I found ways to use the trimmer at different angles. That took some experimentation, but now I&#x27;ve got the hang of it. Highly recommended - a lot of value for low price.</li>
    <li> Pretty much works like the reviews said! Gotta make a couple runs if your hair is longer than 1/2 inch or so, but overall it works well.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Trimms evenly &amp; smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;2. Less sound.&lt;br /&gt;3. Light, portable &amp; comes along with pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Above average build quality.&lt;br /&gt;2. Trim blades are thin unlike the sturdy moser trimmers.</li>
    <li> I had a CORDED Norelco adjustable beard shaver for many years. About six months ago the on/off switch started to fail. I looked for a replacement at the stores and online but to no avail. I called Norelco asking about a replacement- at that time they said they didn’t have one. In a pinch, I purchased a Remington MB-200; it had the adjustable feature but was not corded.  I was lucky to complete a trim before the battery gave out.  I have since purchased this Norelco, am on the third weekly trim on the same charge.  This is definitely a 10 out of 10.</li>
    <li> I like: fast charge, long battery life, size, weight. I have no issues with the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like: I can go through my entire face over and over again on the shortest setting (0.5mm) and the trim is very inconsistent. I end up having strands with different lengths. It is not such a good look. The attachment head is not as good as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could have been perfect.</li>
    <li> Most trimmers come with a limited set of options for length.  I like to keep about 3 days growth and most trimmers don&#x27;t really support this.  With this little guy, I can do 0-14 days growth with no problem.  That means you can do your chest, stomach, and face and not have to switch blade guards and or even have to deal with blade guards.  It&#x27;s kind of genius.</li>
    <li> I needed a new trimmer and this one does the trick. I like the easy adjustable setting and it works perfectly. To get just under the nose I have to take off the adjusting plastic part to get in close enough. Hold a charge a long time.</li>
    <li> first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had(first beard I&#x27;ve had)... works excellent, does everything I need it to do, easy operation and breakdown for cleaning... costs good money, but after researching I decided to buy-once-cry-once.</li>
    <li> This is THE trimmer I was looking for. It works as expected. I have charged it for 90 minutes and till now got about 35-40 minutes of time from it. Still a great buy and worth the money.</li>
    <li> read all other reviews  , saw video on u tube ? that made up my mind .  just as they said . its great , very good trimmer</li>
    <li> Hubby loves the ease of use and I love the clean look</li>
    <li> Easy to use and to clean ! Sattisfied with the product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I love it!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and works very well.</li>
    <li> Nice, easy to use, no frills whisker trimmer! Makes your man have that macho stubble at multiple lengths! Would recommend AAA+++</li>
    <li> The perfect little trimmer. I recommend this to anyone who has a mustache or beard because of the ease of use and comfort in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my better half. Trims nicely, he loves the adjustable with one movement features vs putting on different tops. The battery lasts a long time on one charge. Easy to clean, he is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a thick beard for &amp;#62;30 years and now that it is gray it&#x27;s even harder to trim. I&#x27;ve been though multiple trimmers at home and everything from Conair to Wahl models. This model is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever owned. I am baffled by the poor reviews on this product. The charge last long and is quick to recharge. The cover is easy to remove and clean. The shaver is ergonomic and easy to change the beard length. It does not pull or scrape. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Trims evenly. Best I have owned.</li>
    <li> fantastic product and shipping!! accurately described!</li>
    <li> dont like how the adjustable height part comes all the way off.</li>
    <li> Very accurate and nice trimmer for beard</li>
    <li> Love it! Trims well and the length adjustment is precise. You can also get a pretty close shave if you remove the length adjuster.</li>
    <li> Writing from my wife&#x27;s account...This trimmer is TERRIBLE.  The guard itself is only anchored in one place over the trimmer.  Therefore, the guard will actually bend when pressure is applied.  I went from having a full thick beard to having to shave it off, because the guard on this trimmer is extremely flimsy, and ended up shaving bald spots in my beard.  This is unacceptable.  It will take me a couple month to grow my beard back like that.</li>
    <li> After 2 months it continues to be reliable, unlike other stubble trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my hubby. He is very lazy about shaving. But after having this he just enjoys the shapes of his beard ...and trimming...lol. He loves it..No charging problem so far.</li>
    <li> Fast charge, easy clean, doesn&#x27;t take off as much as I&#x27;d like on a single run.</li>
    <li> I got this as a preshaver for my other electric shaver to get a clean shave. It works pretty well, but it can take a while to get everything shaved at the finest shaving setting which is what I only use it for. It hasn&#x27;t broke yet after a month or so. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Simply can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think its very user friendly as other trimmer models are.  I find the turn dial settings to be easily changed.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer once a week for about a year. I wear a full beard and mustache trimmed to about 1/4\\&quot; in length. This product works as advertised, is easy to maintain, and with my usage the battery holds a charge for about three months. I am completely satisfied with my Philips Norelco QT 4014, and have gifted two of these trimmers to family members.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for the Norelco QT4021 that it replaced, which would only hold a charge enough for about 1.5 trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QT4014/42 has smaller increments than the QT4021, but I found that a 5 on the QT4014/42 is somewhere halfway between a 4 and a 5 on the QT4021, which is where I trim my beard. I&#x27;m actually using 5.5 now, and it seems near the 5 on the QT4021.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve charged it once since first getting it (it was up to a full charge FAST), and have used it for trimming my beard 6 or 7 times, and it still hasn&#x27;t needed to be recharged. Note that the head pops off for rinsing it off, but there appears to be some white grease where the bits for the head mate to the lower part, so be careful not to remove it. I&#x27;ve found that removing the comb (by CAREFULLY pulling straight up from the body..different than the QT4021)  and brushing it off is sufficient for cleaning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great beard trimmer, and hopefully the battery holds up!</li>
    <li> good trimmer and it give me an smooth shave for my skin</li>
    <li> This beats my regular trimmer on my Norelco shaver. It has an excellent height adjustment built into the shaver and it can be removed for a real close trim.&lt;br /&gt;I rate this a high five stars.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Impressed.</li>
    <li> I had another that lasted over 5 years and finally did not hold a charge (but still worked while plugged in) I&#x27;m going on a trip so I needed a chargeable one and this is perfect. Seller is great, great response.</li>
    <li> The previous model of this trimmer was my favorite trimmer ever made. Unfortunately, this model does NOT meet expectations. The top guard is incredibly flimsy. The design is pretty atrocious. When i say that, I&#x27;m referring to the fact that replacing the guard after removing it to get the close shave is really awkward. I don&#x27;t have much confidence in this staying together when I eventually drop it once. The increments you see on the dial are millimeters (with .5 mm as the dots between the numbers). While I like the way this trimmer feels in the hand and the job it does, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that in the process of slimming their trimmer down, Philips has made it feel so so cheap. Also the charging port is really awkward I wish they would just ditch their current plug and go with something magnetic or a stand.</li>
    <li> Excellent Trimmer. I&#x27;m someone who hardly ever shaves clean, but keeps a manicured stubble or sometimes a little thicker. I use this to trim my facial hair every few days. It charges very fast and keeps a good charge for a few uses. I love the different length settings and it&#x27;s very easy to adjust to each. The removable cover for the blades is strong plastic and is very durable. Great price as well... Definitely a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great, no issues or problems at all.  It took me a minute to grasp how everything works but I don&#x27;t think I could have designed it any better, lots of adjustments to pick from and it will reach whole face even under nose.  Battery holds a charge just fine, it took a few weeks before it needed the 1st charge and I use it every other day.  Just follow instructions and use it until indicator light goes yellow then charge to full, repeat.  I also like the fact that it will run off the cord if needed.  Comes with a little brush to clean after each shave, simple enough and you don&#x27;t need to rinse it or anything.  Happy customer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Item was as advertized.Arrived early and works properly.</li>
    <li> Easy to use buzzer, cuts well &amp; cuts fast. However, a major problem I&#x27;m coming across is cleaning the blades. There seems to be no way to remove the gate that covers the blades, so you need a long brush or some type of wire cleaner to get through them. Other than that, fantastic problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company also offers a free warranty for their product upon opening it. I suggest signing up right away, this service is rare and should be very appreciated!</li>
    <li> It works well, but some hairs on my cheeks grow in different directions and the trimmer has a very hard time cutting them, even if I go in all different directions.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is it could be slightly better. But for 25 bucks it&#x27;s still a great deal and it works exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed when I got it by looks, but after using it very impressed.</li>
    <li> i like the newer model but this one is great too</li>
    <li> This one is not as easy to clean as the model it replaced but everything else is improved.  Used every other day</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do.  The plastic add-on feels very flimsy and moves around a bit - don&#x27;t know if it is meant to have that give??</li>
    <li> bit disappointed that attachment don&#x27;t come out for close and low level cuts.  Still like it overall and i am using it for day to day trimming.</li>
    <li> Best parts: the guard stays put and has a lot of different options to adjust to your desired length, the rechargeable battery lasts forever and then recharges in no time. You can wash the hair out of the head easily enough and it cuts through thin and bushy beards with ease. The only thing to consider is there&#x27;s no vacuum on this thing, so shave in the shower or somewhere you don&#x27;t mind little hairs flying everywhere. I did it one time over the sink and won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. A quality product from Philips, with very good value. It is very comfortable to use , doesn&#x27;t make any problem in the skin, the head doesn&#x27;t get hot like normal trimmers, I can use it without the comb if needed, and the battery life is just AMAZING with fast charging!!!!</li>
    <li> Battery lasts a long time and works great. I&#x27;ve owned other trimmers and this is my first lithium-ion. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> If you are just looking for a normal and basic trimmer this will be the one to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design and quality are good.</li>
    <li> Trimmer works well and is exactly what it was advertised to be.  The battery lasts a long time, and gives this little trimmer a lot of power.  It is much more effective that my prior trimmer which was battery operated, did not have a lot of power, was not overly effective, and needed frequent battery changes.  I am female and have been using it for body hair including armpits, taming the winter overgrowth on my legs, and my pubes.  My only concern is that it works so well that I have to be extra careful not to get too close to my girl parts!  (ouch!)  The upshot is that these trim so well that I don&#x27;t have to use them as often.  I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Next, I want to invest in a shaver to get rid of the very short stubble these leave on my legs.  I was expecting this, as these are not intended to  provide a clean shave.  In the past, I would have simply used a disposable razor, but due to some current mobility issues, I want something electric as I am afraid of cutting myself with a blade.</li>
    <li> works way better than the Wahl cordless it replaced.  nice even trimming with plenty of battery power.</li>
    <li> Use it for my face and it works great for beard trimming, not so much to trim a sideburn.  My other trimmer was better for trimming the bikini region according to my GF.  She could get close enough to look shaved without the burn or a razor or shaver, this one she can&#x27;t get the same result (unless the built in gauge comes off and I am too dumb to figure out how to remove it).  That gauge is nice if you want the same results each time and no need to fumble with and look for traditional guards. Recharging is also a nice touch with a simple plug in (i.e. no need to have a stand on your sink).</li>
    <li> Perfect.  It trims my beard and mustache to my desired length.  It has many different length settings and the battery seems to last a good amount of time.  For the price of this trimmer you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> This is a great peice of machine.  i wish i had found this years before,  instead of buying cheap trimmers for all these years.</li>
    <li> This is a very comfortable, powerful and compact trimmer. It charges up very quickly. The included carrying case could be a little bit roomier, but it is just possible to fit the trimmer and power cord into the case with a bit of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro]], which has very similar specifications but includes a vacuum container to catch the hair. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch all of the trimmed hair, but it catches most of it; and while both the QT4014 and the QT4070 are supposed to trim to .5mm, I trimmed with the QT4014 on its lowest setting and found it didn&#x27;t seem to trim as close as my QT4070. I trimmed again with the QT4070 on my usual setting (number 2) and, sure enough, I was able to trim more closely; the QT4070&#x27;s number 1 setting would have trimmed even closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My findings: this trimmer is a great trimmer, less expensive and more comfortable against the skin and to hold than the QT4070, but it lacks the vacuum feature and doesn&#x27;t trim as close as the QT4070.</li>
    <li> Sometimes experience with a particular brand can be the best teacher when looking at new products, and such was the case with this one. Having a beard can present different daily challenges if one wants to keep it trimmed at different lengths over the changing seasons, shorter in the summer and longer in the winter, and this one is up to the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new [[ASIN:B00ARF44O6 Philips Norelco QT4014/42 Beard and Stubble Trimmer]] has proven to be up to a good one for general beard trimming. It has enough adjustments in approximate lengths from a very close 0.5mm (just under 1/64 inch) stubble, up to a 10mm (13/32 inch) longer beard length, in twenty precision length settings. Pop the adjustable comb assembly off and you have trimmer, which is excellent for mustache trimming and shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Full range of adjustments; 20 settings via adjustable dial on handle; lockable&lt;br /&gt;+ 1-hour charge; can be used while charger unit is plugged in&lt;br /&gt;+ Ni-MH powered; lasts longer than equivalent NiCad batteries&lt;br /&gt;+ Detachable cutting unit; can be rinsed under the faucet for easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;+ True ergonomic design; easy handling from any angle&lt;br /&gt;+ Battery light; green when full, blinking orange when low&lt;br /&gt;+ Worldwide operation; 100 to 240 voltage&lt;br /&gt;+ 2-year guarantee; extended with product registration&lt;br /&gt;+ Reasonably priced; excellent bang for the buck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly noisy, though not as bad as some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived in a sturdy cardboard display box, and inside was the trimmer, the charger/power adapter, a cleaning brush, a thin nylon travel case and a fairly thorough instruction sheet in both English and Spanish. Charged it for an hour before giving it the trial run, and found that it was very easy to use and quite ergonomic. It didn&#x27;t take long to figure out the best setting for personal use; my beard is fairly close, so the #3 setting on the dial worked well. It would be suggested to start with the higher numbers and work your way down through the twenty settings until you find the best setting for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pull the trimming comb attachment off and you&#x27;ll find a good titanium-coated cutting unit, which is excellent for trimming a mustache or minor sculpting. Most interesting was that this cutting unit is \\&quot;skin-friendly\\&quot; and rounded; it doesn&#x27;t dig into the skin like some. The blades are also self-sharpening, and no oil is needed. The cutting unit assembly is easily detachable, and can be rinsed under the faucet for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer can be used for about 50 minutes when fully charged, and can also be used when the battery is down by plugging in its charger/power adapter. The battery light glows green when full charged, blinks orange when it&#x27;s getting low and blinks green during charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted earlier, experience with a particular brand can be the best teacher when looking at a product. I&#x27;ve owned the more basic [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] since I purchased it in 2008, and it has proven to be quite reliable, as I had noted in my review of that product posted in 2009. It had been a replacement for an old Norelco Maverick TX-450 battery-operated trimmer that I had owned for over sixteen years before it quit. The Philips Norelco G370 is still functional and operating quite well, though it&#x27;s battery life is on a slight decline, after five years of use, I have no complaints. This new Philips Norelco QT4014/42 is more of a subjective evolutionary and convenience upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get this new model, be sure to read the manual first and charge the unit for an hour before its first use. Play with the settings, starting at 20 and work your way down until you find the right length for your own needs. If you want to use a more economical, cheaper trimmer, the Philips Norelco G370 is a good one. Considering the priceof that unit, it has worked out to be less than four bucks per year, and that makes it a bargain. If it died tomorrow, I would have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new [[ASIN:B00ARF44O6 Philips Norelco QT4014/42 Beard and Stubble Trimmer]] has quickly proven to be up to a very good one for general beard trimming. There are more feature-laden models of beard and stubble trimmers with integrated vacuum systems, such as the QT4050 or the QT4070, but it&#x27;s the simplicity and convenience of this QT4014/42 that made it so appealing. This new one is highly recommended to those looking for a mid-range beard and stubble trimmer, and I&#x27;m looking forward to summer to drop it to the #1 setting for the stubble effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/1/2013of that unit, it has worked out to be less than four bucks per year, and that makes it a bargain. If it died tomorrow, I would have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new [[ASIN:B00ARF44O6 Philips Norelco QT4014/42 Beard and Stubble Trimmer]] has quickly proven to be up to a very good one for general beard trimming.

    <li> Awsome product.  Really easy to adjust the length - I use a slightly shorter setting for under my chin and this makes it easy.</li>
    <li> Very helpful product. It does the job quickly, and isnt very big neither expensive at all. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third Norelco trimmer in eleven years. This one cuts the hair off my whiskers as well as its predecessors. It&#x27;s lighter but looks no less sturdy. Rick murkyvista.com</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he has thoroughly enjoyed this trimmer! He like the different levels you can make just by turning the dial. It is very easy to use, you just have to get the hang of a new trimmer! Another feature he really loves is that it is rechargeable, because before he went through so many batteries and it would die in the middle of him using his old trimmer. In all, I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, compact and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Seems strong, Cuts great, great control.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd Philips Norelco in like 10 years. They all eventually break, But awesome for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing trimmer! Especially for beard trimming and doing different sizes. I have tried MANY trimmers, but this is one of the best ones I have come across!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts for a long time as well. Easy to clean and operate!</li>
    <li> easy to use. every hair cut exactly the same  length. good charging system, all around good!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> Something is not right with the comb on this model.  I used it on my beard on setting 1 with the comb and it gave me bald spots!  I have another Norelco trimmer with a different style comb and never had a problem with it.  Very strange.  I will have to look for another model.</li>
    <li> This Philips Norelco beard and mustache trimmer works very well. I like the adjustable length settings; it&#x27;s easy to dial-in the perfect length and get consistent results time after time. The battery lasts almost literally forever. I&#x27;ve only charged it once since I got this, and that was a long, long time ago.</li>
    <li> Takes several passes to cut my thin beard.</li>
    <li> My husband enjoyed the simplicity and no fuss functions.</li>
    <li> I prefer the style with the vacuum, as it saves time cleaning up, but overall this is a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> Does the job, and the numbered trimmer length is a plus.  Not really that powerful, so I wouldn&#x27;t depend on it to trim stubble any better than your standard shaver.  Certainly not at the level of a barber shop trimmer.  Enough to trim the longer hairs of your beard, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to throw the cut whiskers all over the place, just like any other trimmer of this design.  Makes me think one with a built-in vacuum system might be worth a look.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. I like how you can get your beard down to a specific measurement. This trimmer is worth the price</li>
    <li> Very long battery life, I use twice weekly on a heavy beard, the first charge lasted four months.  I get the cut I want.  It did take some learning, but it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for my son and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Ok product, no rocket science here.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how long the blades stay sharp.&lt;br /&gt;For now it works as described</li>
    <li> I was looking for an economical beard trimmer that would travel well.  The dial setting for trimming eliminates the need for accessories.  I also like the fact that it will work for international travel with no converter required.  All in all, a great beard trimmer for my needs.  I would give this product five stars if the travel bag had room for the trimmer, recharger and cleaning brush to fit comfortably.  This is an area where many vendors skimp and where Phillips Norelco has an opportunity to achieve greater product differentiation - especially for those like me who are looking for a compact trimmer that travels well.</li>
    <li> Watch hockey? Know a great beard when you see one? New York Rangers&#x27; coach John Tortorella come to mind? (That&#x27;s spoken as a Capitals&#x27; fan.) This Norelco is beautiful and I don&#x27;t see how you can do any better. My wife of 34 years told me I looked nice the day I used it; then I told her why. A retired New Jersey judge I was chatting with on the beach in Costa Rica asked me if I had my beard professionally trimmed. Nobody had ever asked me that in the 35 years I&#x27;ve had the beard. &#x27;Nuf said.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is really good. I&#x27;ve charged a complete night and i&#x27;ve used it for more than 4 times. It has amazing battery back up. Mine is very hard beard so i usually prefer to shave as if i do trimm my beard, it does not look smoot. But this is not the case with this trimmer. I get a very smooth (almost a shave like) trimming. +1 for the setting/adjustments</li>
    <li> After many years of trimming my beard with scissors, I tried my son&#x27;s trimmer and decided to get my own.  Very easy to use, ergonomic, and with the attached grooming comb seems to cut evenly and without pinching or pulling. Very adjustable, with 20 settings.  I&#x27;ve been using the exact middle of the range which yields a shorter trim than I could get with scissors and is quite neat.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has a rechargeable battery that lasts a long time.  It is nice and small, so it works around tight spots well.  The adjustment for hair trimming length is really nice, and turning it on and off is easy, as the handle is slidable.</li>
    <li> Does not trim as closely as advertised without the guard.  Also it doesn&#x27;t edge as cleanly as I would like.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the product. Uneven trimming and on/off slide can be a little hard to move. Expected better of Phillips Norelco.  Sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> Review for: Philips Norelco QT4014 Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Adjustment for different beard lengths is implemented very well.  No need for other accessories or to change setting once you set it, even to remove guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Very EASY TO CLEAN.  Hairs get caught under the guard but the guard pops on and off easily, naturally, and quickly.  There is no need to change beard length setting to pop it on and off as with some other units out there.  You will also probably want to pop open the unit at the top to blow hair out at the end of each shave, but it&#x27;s easy once you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Feels good and natural in the hands.  Clearly a lot of thought went into the ERGONOMICS with the curvatures of the guard and the neck bend in the overall shape.  Not too big or small, just the right size, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) Looks good.  Some models out there just look cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) No stand, just plug a cord in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(6) Low noise, as quiet as you can expect for a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It is quite difficult to get an even length trim with an electric trimmer alone if your goal is a close trim, especially on the neck with all the long hairs that lay flat.  This is likely due to the DIFFERENT ANGLES OF ATTACK, DIFFERENT PRESSURE, and DIFFERENT HAIR ANGLES FROM FACE as we move over the face and neck.  If you can keep this in mind and keep it under control you might just get a more barber-ish even trim.  I have not mastered this yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wording it this way because I&#x27;m not so sure it is the fault of this razor or its guard, it seems to be a somewhat universal complaint by a percentage of users out there for most electric trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES:&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I use this mostly to make actually shaving easier.  I have a great shaver that causes me less irritation if I get anything down to very short in advance, and this does it quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It charges for an hour and is then useful for 90 minutes (untested, this is from manual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some trimmers out there claim you can use them in the shower, however some feel that is only relevant without the beard length guard and some feel it is tough to trim with them when the hairs are wet.  Also some of those wet/shower models have instructions not to use lotion with it, which for some is a real issue.  Consider calling the manufacturer and downloading instructions for such details before committing to such models vs. dry trim models like this one.  I had a likely well-meaning salesperson at a shaving boutique leave out such details for one such \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Indeed lots of hairs to cleanup vs. a vacuum unit as folks have noted.  However, it seems a fairly quick task to scoop up the bulk of them with wettened and squeezed toilet paper or paper towel to help avoid future sink clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some trimmers ask that you oil the blades every use, just something to look into as you go about comparing them.It charges for an hour and is then useful for 90 minutes (untested, this is from manual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some trimmers out there claim you can use them in the shower, however some feel that is only relevant without the beard length guard and some feel it is tough to trim with them when the hairs are wet.

    <li> Excelent product. Excelent service. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace a Wahl peanut as a beard trimmer. The Wahl is a great trimmer, but this is a lot better for beards, especially with how precise the adjustments are.</li>
    <li> Its so much better than i hoped for. I have a very course, sense beard and this trimmer made the job effortless. I&#x27;m much happier having is bears trimmer with how quickly and smoothly it trims my beard.</li>
    <li> First hair trimmer and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;However, it takes a while until I&#x27;m done trimming my beard (10-15mins)</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very ergonomic. Even with the guard removed, it is difficult to hurt yourself with. It mows right through a thick beard. I shave my head with this as well. I wish I would have bought this instead of the Oster. It is way more comfortable, is cordless and makes shaving a (much faster) pleasure.</li>
    <li> Could not find one like this locally, but I did not like what the box stores had. In fact, I tried a Wahl that looks similar to this and it pulled the hair on my chinny-chin-chin, plus the rubberized coating collected hair clippings that you simply could not clean off. The Phillips one has just the right shape, firm adjusting knob and a quick charger. Me like.</li>
    <li> Just got my new trimmer and gave it a much needed test. (my beard had grown out quite a bit) It charged fast, within an hour, and held the charge surprisingly well while &amp;#34;mowing&amp;#34; my beard off! It held plenty of charge for the amount of beard I needed to trim. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about, and it&#x27;s not a big deal, is that it&#x27;s smaller than my old Norelco...narrower in the hand. But that&#x27;s probably just a matter of getting used to it. Also, It CAN be used with the power cord to if needed. So, overall I&#x27;m pleased with it. And it was reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This comes with a 2 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used both corded and cordless.&lt;br /&gt;It has a &amp;quot;fast charge&amp;quot; where you can charge the batteries in about an hour. And they hold a charge for at least 50 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a tote bag, AC plugin, rechargeable battery, and a cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;Why it&#x27;s &amp;quot;bent&amp;quot; the way it is, I don&#x27;t know. But it doesn&#x27;t really bother me when shaving with it.&lt;br /&gt;I just received this so don&#x27;t know how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying from what I&#x27;ve experienced so far.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift. I didn&#x27;t know I needed one of these, but man, it&#x27;s a life-changer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen: I don&#x27;t shave every day. Maybe every three or four days. I just don&#x27;t care that much about it. But when you do that, the beard gets too long to effectively use an electric shaver. So I switched to using a disposable razor, which would clog with hair unless I rinse it after every single stroke. Which makes shaving take a long time, another deterrent to doing it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about this Philips trimmer is that the length of the hair you&#x27;re cutting is irrelevant to how long it takes you to do the whole face. It doesn&#x27;t clog, it doesn&#x27;t go past long hairs, it just gets everything vroom vroom vroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I use it more often, I can dial to specific lengths (2.5 on the face, maybe 1.5 under the chin) and it&#x27;s consistent every time. Easy to tap out the stubble into the sink when I&#x27;m done. No wasted water. The battery holds a charge a long time -- I think in the nearly six months I&#x27;ve had it I&#x27;ve charged it twice. And it&#x27;s small and seems relatively durable, with nothing protruding to break off (I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a consumer electronics product with which I&#x27;m totally satisfied, and let me tell you, those are few and far between.</li>
    <li> love this trimmer. Looks good and arrived on time</li>
    <li> Works great. No issues. Would recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am very, very happy with this beard trimmer. I normally keep a stubble-length beard (though I grow it out more in the winter). This is the best trimmer I have used, and I have gone through a lot in my day. At the lowest setting, is is a very short stubble, perfect for twice a week trimming. The adjustable head is makes trimming my side burns and mustache super easy as well. It runs a long time on a charge as well. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done and the trimmer hasn&#x27;t given me any really problems. I&#x27;m only about 85% happy with the guard, but not enough to dissuade use</li>
    <li> I really like it. You don&#x27;t have to put on an off other various blades, just rotate the gear and voila!</li>
    <li> very good trimmer all day</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Easily adjustable to your preference.  Easy to clean and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Each battery cycle last forever ! Super easy to use. Powerful little tool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040]] to trim my mustache, and it works well, if not perfectly. So I decided to give this Norelco a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed on removing it from the box was that it seemed small and not really well made. When I was ready to try it I discovered that the length setting is a dial that goes all the way through the handle. It is somewhat difficult to turn, but also fails to snap soundly to a setting. The trimmer does trim, but seems underpowered compared to the Remington. Removing the comb, the bare blade actually trims a bit better than the Remington, but the shape and angle of the handle makes it harder to maneuver. You can get the job done with this product, but there are better trimmers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this Norelco is a cut or two below my Remington.</li>
    <li> Personally highly disappointed with this product as far as a shaver goes but as far a trimmer goes, its okay, we&#x27;ll take it. So it gets a 3.5 stars. It will take off all your beard and leave all of your stubble that is why it is called Beard and Stubble Trimmer. It Chargers in less than an hour although the instructions say about 55 mins, and then advices you to let the item completely deplete the charge. I&#x27;ll repeat myself, it&#x27;s an okay trimmer but not a good or spectacular clipper for shaving. It will only trim. Not shave in the important areas or in important ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight, slim, longer than I would like (or am used to) but I will adjust to quickly. The selection dial is dead center just above the on off switch, which by the way is a slide not a button. I would not recommend this particular Trimmer but I would not not recommend it either.  This item is one of those your own choice type of items. Good luck.</li>
    <li> The QT4014/42 is a replacement for the less expensive Philips Norelco QT4000/42 beard trimmer that I purchased which only lasted through one (1) charge before failing to re-charge.  When I returned the QT4000/42 (after the usual 30 day return period) I was charged a &amp;#34;restocking fee&amp;#34;, even though it was a defective unit, and would not likely be restocked. This was tacky of Amazon to charge me this so called &amp;#34;restocking fee&amp;#34;.  Amazon is not Nordstrom or Costco in their return policy, and that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on the original charge with the QT4014/42, so it&#x27;s too early to tell if this one is a dud too, but time will tell.  If it is, it&#x27;ll be tossed in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the trimmer is ok, not great.  While it trims my beard, there are quite a few hairs that need to be touched up with a scissor.  If it did a more uniform job of trimming I would have given it 4 stars, but it didn&#x27;t so 3 stars is all it gets.</li>
    <li> The product works great.  The best thing being the battery.  It runs forever on a charge.  I&#x27;ve had cheaper trimmers and after a few months the battery dies.  Spend a little more and get a quality battery.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> stop working bad quality, i was firs time write 5 star and now it was stop</li>
    <li> Has 20 settings in 1/2 length settings (i.e. 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 etc. all the way to 10 which gives you 20 settings for length).  Clipper head pops off easily for cleaning and stays locked for trimming.  Best trimmer I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> I have used many trimmers over the years and this one is the best so far. I have had it for month and so far I like it. I can really dial in my desired length with ease. I change length with the seasons. Trimmers in the past had a hard time trimming my jaw line by my ear, not this one. Trims to perfection. I believe it has to do with the off set design. Makes it easy to trim hard places. Another must have feature it has for me is the ability to be used corded or cordless. How many people would by a new battery if it went? Not many in my opinion. This gives you the ability to have it for awhile. Great product! I would recommend highly!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a beard trimmer for a while now to replace my old trimmer. One of the biggest problems was finding one not in the standard #1, #2, #3.... guards length. This trimmer filled that gap. with half increments. With the half increments I can be real precise on how long I want my beard to be. It trims it very evenly.The battery life is so far really good. I have had it for 5 months and have not had to recharge it.  UPDATE: I have now had this trimmer for over 2 years and it still works fantastic. In that 2 years I have only had to charge it twice!! That is unheard of. Extremely happy with it. Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a trimmer it serves the purpose but you cannot get a close shave with it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this razor.  I got 26 shaves (average time 2 1/2 - 3 minutes) before I had to charge the battery.  It&#x27;s lightweight--good for trips.  I don&#x27;t clean it, just tap it a bit to get rid of the hair.  Like all portable razors, you have to move it slowly over your beard and repeat it a bit.  I particularly light the manual depth setting--nothing to screw up or worry about.  I wish I had found this razor years ago.</li>
    <li> ...purchased this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! I will be telling all my friends that they should throw out all their other trimmers and get this one. I have about 6 of them in my drawer and plan on getting rid of them. the one I used to like the best was the Braun body Cruzer until I was shaving and it started pulling and was painful. the one I still like the best for the back is the Mangroomer electric back shaver.</li>
    <li> This may be the best trimmer made</li>
    <li> best groomer ever , great price</li>
    <li> great trimmer hubby loves it</li>
    <li> Pretty nice, although I was hoping it would have more adjustable trimming lengths. Doesn&#x27;t really help trimming of you have short facial hair. I can&#x27;t imagine going over the 3 setting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for close to a year now and can say that it works very well. The battery life is fantastic lasting me 6-10 trims before needing a charge. The only thing that isn&#x27;t great is the built-in length settings feature which is essentially a plastic guard that is supposed to allow you to choose the length of your beard. This feature is quite frankly pretty bad. However if you are someone that wants a good trimmer that&#x27;s quick, painless, and is very portable this gets the job done. It is also very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> So far, this trimmer seems quite good, though slightly more complicated than necessary. It seems sturdy and reliable but a tad less user~friendly than expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent battery life.  I probably went three months without charging.  So simple to use.  Lightweight.  Easy to change length and to pop off all together to detail lines.  I love there are no interchangeable heads just rotate the dial for depth change.  I wanted simple.  This is simplicity at its best.  Exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box, fully charged in an hour, this does a great job on my forever stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another trimmer I&#x27;ve been using that I like very much (a Remington MB4040) but this recharges faster and the while the size of the trimming area is pretty close in size to my other shaver, the actual size of the shaver&#x27;s body is a bit smaller and fits nicely in the pouch that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on taking this with me on the road because of the travel pouch, fast charging and the great shave I get from the Philips Norelco QT4014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice now and it&#x27;s really nice, fits perfectly in my hand and shaves nice &amp; close in the zero setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used with the cord if you can&#x27;t wait an hour for the charging to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is a winner and does a Great job without doing a bad number on my skin, I Like it very much.</li>
    <li> A million time better than the other beard trimmers I have used and bought on Amazon!  Battery life is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have the whole range of Philips shavers, trimmers....&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s review the Beard and Stubble trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple that I got confused at first. There is a molette that can be turned to define the lenghts of the beard you want to keep.&lt;br /&gt;Careful because minimum is short of a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to trim my goatee and set it to the minimum, without removing the lenghts setting tool and I realized after one quick attempt that I had pretty much killed the goatee. I was eventually left with a shadow of a goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s to like:&lt;br /&gt;- Light&lt;br /&gt;- Fast charge&lt;br /&gt;- 1 hour battery life (per manufacturer)... All I know is that it never took me that long to trim.&lt;br /&gt;- Good quality&lt;br /&gt;- No extra things to carry along. It still comes with a pouch.&lt;br /&gt;- Charger compatible from 100 to 240V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like:&lt;br /&gt;- Not standard charger (I had to find one bad thing to say)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Convenient small size easy to hold.  Fast charging in about an hour.  Carry pouch to take it with you.  20 settings to get the length you want.  Water proof for fast cleaning, just hold under running water.  Self sharping blades, should last quite a while.  Over all a good deal.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday.  Bought a more expensive one on sale at Costco, but it did not perform as well.  The blade guard takes some getting used to, but ultimately it has been quite a great little trimmer.</li>
    <li> I finally gave up on shaving. Electric or manual, I always ended up with some irritation, despite trying all kinds of tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is simple, easy to use, and hopefully reliable. I looked high and low for the perfect trimmer that was dual voltage (for international travel), and I believe I found it (and surprisingly it&#x27;s not one of the more expensive options). The dial rotates so that the length locks in. The shortest setting gives me a &amp;#34;36 hour stubble,&amp;#34; though I&#x27;ve been opting for the 2nd setting (1mm). The guard is pretty good and seems like it will last. The cut is even and it doesn&#x27;t take many passes to get everything. The trimmer isn&#x27;t too big and the charger is tiny, which is good for travel. The only thing to note is that hair will go everywhere. Some other models have a vacuum, but the general consensus seemed to be that they don&#x27;t work well enough to bother.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought. I love the adjustable head on here, as there is no guess work, and the adjustment sticks perfectly with no slipping to lower settings. This device holds a charge extremely well, for weeks and weeks on end.</li>
    <li> Does the job and does it well. Bought this for my husband and his only suggestion was not trim settings (longer). Otherwise a great trimmer at a great price...</li>
    <li> I had problems immediately with first use: the trimmer seems to have a mind of its own, turning on and off on its own schedule while you try to use it.  If it worked properly, I would likely have rated it well, as it cut nicely, but I had to toss it after a few days of fussing with it.</li>
    <li> This was my first trimmer and the best trimmer.Very smooth,good battery backup.Great product to buy</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works great for the price.  Just dial the length you want and go.  Very simple to use.  Holds a charge a really long time. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Norelco.  Kinda shoots hair in a wide pattern around the sink (could just be me), but easy to clean up after.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Cuts well and holds a long charge. Will definitely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE MY PREVIOUS NORELCO BEARD TRIMMER THAT FINALLY WOULD NOT CHARGE ANYMORE, RECEIVED IT IN A TIMELY FASHION AND THE PACKAGING WAS NICE, I PLUGGED IT IN AND CHARGED IT FOR A TIME, THEN I USED IT TO TRIM MY ENTIRE BEARD AND IT DID A GREAT JOB, REALLY SHARP CUTTING EDGE, TOOK A COUPLE TRIES TILL I FOUND OUT WHAT SETTING I LIKED. BUT AFTER MY FIRST USE I CAN HONESTLY SAY IT DID A GREAT JOB OF TRIMMING MY BEARD. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE NEEDING A NEW BEARD TRIMMER. I HOPE THIS ONE LASTS AS LONG AS MY PREVIOUS ONE DID. NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW LONG I HAD PREVIOUS ONE BUT IT HAS TO BE OVER 10 YEARS..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Phillips Norelco QT4014/42 Trimmer for ten days now and it has worked great. Does not pull and snag hair, keeps a smooth even hair length. Very pleased thus far!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in two days free thanks to Amazon Prime! It arrived in a plain brown box for the outside container and the original manufacturer&#x27;s box (just like you would but it in an actual retail store). Inside the box it included the trimmer, charger, instruction manual, plastic guard, soft carrying/storage bag and a small brush to remove the hair from the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged the unit up for approximately three hours and I could have used it sooner but I actually forgot it was plugged up. It does have a charging light that indicates when it&#x27;s charging, when it&#x27;s done charging and then it will completely turn off after thirty minutes when it has completed charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set the depth a little high at first just to try it on my beard and goatee, I didn&#x27;t want to remove too much.  After a few passes I adjusted a little closer until I found the perfect height. I finally after years of trying, have a clean, even length mustache and goatee that looks 100% better and feels better too. My wife even complimented on how much smoother and not prickly to her now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another trimmer and I was having to use a comb to achieve my correct thickness because with the old one I lost all of the plastic guards because they were so hard to keep track of and so many of them.  This one is awesome!!!!  It has one guard to keep track of, you can remove the guard to get a skin close shave and it&#x27;s easily adjustable. Now I just use this approximately every other day to keep it neat and groomed and I have yet to have it go dead after ten days. I will also say it works well on body hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it broke I would not hesitate buying another one as it has cut down my time, no longer having to judge the length by using the comb and trimmer method. It&#x27;s powerful enough forme and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. If you&#x27;re considering this for a gift, I think he would love it. I&#x27;m 31 years old and I like things simple and that do the job the first time. Good job Phillips!</li>
    <li> I have used the item for about 2 weeks. It is easy to use and works as promised.</li>
    <li> It works awesome. I love the different lengths that are included. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Good shaver. Stupid charging adapter. Why can&#x27;t these be micro usb? Oh yeah, I forgot it is because when you loose the charger Phillips makes it so you have to buy a whole new shaver since even other products they make don&#x27;t fit into the charger port... Aside from that, it is a good shaver.</li>
    <li> Incredible product, charges in one hour, charge lasts for two weeks, very accurate mm length cutting, rinseable parts, worth the money.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3MSPO87AG12AY]]The video shows me walking you through what comes with the shaver, and how it works. I highlight that it has nice, simple mechanics behind it (no unnecessarily involved phone technology like USB charging, or touch controls), and that it shaves well. I do point out that I am not thrilled with the shape of the device, nor the location of the on/off slider switch. But, other than that, this is a pretty decent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars.</li>
    <li> Seems fine, see how long it lasts!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Works great!</li>
    <li> Battery lasts long, easy to clean, few parts: those are the pluses. Unfortunately I find it just doesn&#x27;t trim evenly. I have to pass over the same area 3, 4, 5 times to get an even trim.</li>
    <li> I have tried many sideburn and beard trimmers and there are a lot of not so good ones out there.  This one has a number of attributes that combine to make it the best that I have found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the blades on this trimmer are sharp and powerful.  My mustache is thick with tough hairs, and my old Wahl simply could not cut through the hairs well enough to give me a sharp mustache trim.  This unit does that.  I can trim my mustache and beard edges and get that sharp look that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this unit has an adjustable screen rather than several different screens.  You can adjust it for many different beard lengths to where it cuts down to a stubble, or barely trims your beard at all.  For me, this works perfectly and it eliminates the need to keep track of multiple screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit and finish of this unit are good.  This is a quality instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was a buck or two more than some of the competition but so far I am liking it better and it was worth the money.  RJB.</li>
    <li> Perfert. No accidents, large battery life, ergonomic, easy to clean. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I like this beard trimmer quite a bit, but there is one feature that it is supposed to have that doesn&#x27;t seem as distinctive to me that I had hoped.  I&#x27;d like to be able to trim my beard to a very short stubble.  Beard trimming is a lot easier on my skin than close blade shaves, so I&#x27;d like to have a beard trimmer that really cuts short without irritating my face.  Based on the trim length this razor is supposed to deliver compared against my old trimmer, I was expecting a closer cut with this one than I got.  So, maybe my old trimmer beats what it says it will do or maybe this one doesn&#x27;t really cut quite as close as it says it will.  Either way, I didn&#x27;t get the upgrade I&#x27;d hoped for.  Otherwise, everything about this trimmer seems good.  It&#x27;s compact and light.  Rechargeable.  Lots of adjustments.  A nice product.  If you don&#x27;t have the same frame of reference I do, this one will probably be just fine.  For me, it&#x27;s fine, but just not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> Trimmer works great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had razors that required changing the cap for various cutting lengths.  But dialing in is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I dove into my shave with a start of 6 and it did a great job.  Removing the cap for trimming is easier than the cutting caps on other razors.  And when the razor is taken off it snaps right back on.  I had a Brahn that was really complex to get the blade back onto the razor body.  Not this.  I like it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a replacement for my trusty older norelco. It has an easily adjustable plastic guard that lengthens with a thumb dial. It&#x27;s very light and not too large to be awkward for accurate trimming. Holds a good charge as well. It&#x27;s suitable for both beard trimming and &#x27;manscaping&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star is the fact that on the lower/closer settings it&#x27;s possible to nick yourself if you aren&#x27;t careful. Exactly that happened to me, and it drew blood. Granted I was getting a little stupid with it but still, it&#x27;s not TOTALLY idiot proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, good razor. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> As Described, Well Packaged, Promptly Shipped. Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the money. Works great, charges great, looks great and is easy to carry with you in your luggage when travelling.</li>
    <li> Awesome beard trimmer. I&#x27;ve always used a shaver to have a nice and smooth clean shaven look all the time, however this tool allows me to keep a 2mm beard all the time and not look like a child at work most days.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very easy to clean with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;The case/bag included is quite shoddy and has begun to unravel after the shaver head has caught some threads when pulling out and ripped some of them. But that&#x27;s a non issue with the trimmer tool.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and my son loves it.</li>
    <li> Lasted 15 months, not happy with quality at all. It&#x27;s past when I can return it, and would not advise someone to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Nice and quiet, and the guard is round and smooth so it does not irritate the skin even if you run it over the same space of skin a number of times trying to get that pesky hair that won&#x27;t stand up. The one thing I am a little disappointed with is that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my last razor. This is probably because of the guard teeth being round and a little thick so that they don&#x27;t cut. I am ok trading comfort for a slightly less close trim.</li>
    <li> I like this device.  Just not shore the plastic adjuster will last, the adjuster seems a little  frail.</li>
    <li> Really awesome and easy to use for beards and other hairs.  Only one thing I dislike:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable guard is great for determining what length you&#x27;d like the hair to be.  But while most guards I&#x27;ve seen are built like the front of a combine (protruding plastic &amp;#34;tines&amp;#34; like on a fork) this one has curved plastic instead.  To use a fork analogy, if most guards are standard forks, this one would be like if the fork&#x27;s tines were bent back over on themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this amounts to having to go over an area probably twice or three times as much as you would with a more conventional guard.  I guess you could make the argument that this design is marginally safer or more comfortable, but I prefer the combine/fork set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect trimmer otherwise.</li>
    <li> THis trimmer works much better than my old Philips Norelco QT 4070 vacuum trimmer. I get a nice even trim each time I use it. It holds a charge for two weeks easily. Great experience so far.</li>
    <li> only had it for about two hours. so far so good.Did not give it a 5 star because i have not fully used it yet</li>
    <li> Even with the guard off, it doesn&#x27;t really trim close enough.  Guess I made a bad decision on this one.</li>
    <li> Good buy. Best trimmer I have bought without a doubt. Does a great job and virtually fool proof.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Battery last for a long time and it cuts perfectly unlike my last trimmer.  Love the multitude of height settings on this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I was skeptic of this shaver at first. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t live up to the hype and would under deliver. (Little context, I have a 5 times more expensive shaver that while excellent, is not capable of delivering on the stubble/ beard trimming department. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses, though, I was truly surprised at how easy it is to operate this machine, how comfortable it is to use, and the great results it delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not as nice as my old Norelco from 10 years ago.  I think all products are cheapend up these days.</li>
    <li> Very quiet.  Holds charge well.</li>
    <li> great, works perfectly and the many levels make it awesome</li>
    <li> I gifted it to a friend, he used it for a week and thought it was great. But then it stopped working. Will need to have to replaced by warranty.</li>
    <li> I like this.  My only problem is that the angle of the head feels a bit awkward.  I don&#x27;t see how it helps anyone do anything better.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Failed in less than 5 months. Junk. It was nice while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Well built and precision settings. Best one that I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> For the price ($20), this trimmer cannot be beat. I also have the QT4050, and I feel this trimmer outperforms it by a mile. You will not be disappointed in this purchase!</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my beard.  good quality and price</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Many adjustments, long charge life and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, quick delivery!</li>
    <li> After watching a video on Youtube on how to trim your mustache (because it became a cryptic task), this machine was highly recommended among many beard trimmers. I ordered it immediately to see if maybe I had a subpar trimmer. And I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a couple of months now and I love it. It has many more length settings than the usual 1,2,3,4 that come with regular trimmers. Plus, it&#x27;s rechargeable and cordless if needed be. But being able to trim to a specific length is the best feature. And it is also very easy to clean, and can be dismantled for thorough cleaning, which other trimmers won&#x27;t allow. Finally, the trim attachment is much more gentle on the face and better at catching those loose sticking hairs. This is a great machine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty pick with my shavers and I once had one that cost me $5 and I loved it. It lasted for years but then it broke so I had to get something new. I bought this and have been pretty happy. I still like my old one a drop more but they don&#x27;t make it anymore and this one is still very good. I use it very often and it holds a charge for a while and does a good job shaping my beard.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well for the price. Have to see how long it will last.</li>
    <li> Just what I man with A beard needs.</li>
    <li> Have only used this a few times so I can&#x27;t comment on long-term use. I&#x27;m still using the first charge and haven&#x27;t had it plugged back in since the initial charge. It&#x27;s simple to take apart to clean out (which I do every single use) and I love that it has so many settings (makes it easier to fade the beard/side burns into the hairline). Again, haven&#x27;t used it long, but the last trimmer I had was a Phillips Norelco and it lasted close to 10 years. This one can work plugged in, as well, though, so that&#x27;s a big plus (because if it runs out of juice mid shave, the last thing you want to do is stop and have to wait to finish an hour later).</li>
    <li> everything I expected it to be and my son likes his also(a Christmas gif)</li>
    <li> Definitely great battery life!!! Only charged it like twice or so since I bought it.  Has been several months and still works great.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my stolen Wahl Groomsman XL2 (I got an early USA made non-defective one of those).    Pros:  1.  The blades do not make my skin red / chafe / cut when going over an area on my neck multiple times at the lowest setting without the plastic guard.  Great for if your rushing out on the town in a place only 10 minutes away and do not want to look like you just trimmed (waiting for redness to disappear).  2.  Adjusting everything is really easy and cuts evenly when I tried it to go to a 1/4 beard before mainly using it for stubble.  3.  At this point I use it 1-3 times a week and after 2 months of this, I think I only did an initial charge.  4.  Trimming to stubble from a week of growth takes only a couple minutes.  5. Comes with a little draw string bag that fits nicely in my black only version of [[ASIN:B00JJL3YMC Everest Deluxe Toiletry Bag]].    Cons:  1. The only con is that the XL2 had that smaller blade you could use.  That was a unique feature and no other beard trimmer has had it.  I did use it all the time and was easier to use on ears and nose even versus those round trimmers like the crap [[ASIN:B007HJ9VFM Wahl 5640-1001 Lithium Micro Groomsman Personal Trimmer]].    Misc:  While I am not a Colts fan, I do not mind them.  It was the lack of Andrew Luck having this that led to their terrible loss versus the Patriots in the playoffs LOL.  Mr. Luck, do your wife and mom a favor next year and get this!</li>
    <li> When I opened the trimmer and used it for the first time it switched on but when I switch it off it does not go off rather it keeps running. I dont know why but I am going to return the product now.</li>
    <li> Chops through any scruff I have even after a week. Originally, I thought it was waterproof, but only the blades can be washed.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is extremely easy to use. No need for attachments - you simply turn the dial to adjust the desired length. The charger is tiny: just a cord that plugs into the back of the trimmer, so its great for travel. Also, it goes for a long time on one charge, so you may not even need the charger. (One note: make sure you have it turned the right away, which is somewhat counter-intuitively with the power switch facing away from you... Believe it or not, the first time I used this, I was holding the trimmer backwards, which still worked but didn&#x27;t trim nearly as close as I wanted.)</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt; small, light, and easy to maneuver&lt;br /&gt; feels good in the hand&lt;br /&gt; great range of trim lengths&lt;br /&gt; easy to adjust&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;  it took three tries to get the hang of it&lt;br /&gt;  the trim height gard is attached at one end and so fold a bit (i got used to it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would highly recommend this trimmer, it is to easy adjust, operate, and just feel good in the hand to use.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor, and for the most part it does what I need it to do. Basically, my facial hair (goatee) tends to grow unevenly, and there are always certain areas that are longer than others. I ordered this to help me keep it more consistently even rather than having to use clippers to manually do it. For the most part it meets that goal. I can spend less time trying to get everything perfect and more time doing other things, because this only takes about a minute or two of my time to clean up my facial hair and make it even. If that&#x27;s about the amount of time that you plan on spending, then you should be happy with the battery life. The instructions say to charge it fully out of the box (it charges very quickly), then drain it all the way the first time before charging it again. I&#x27;ve had this thing for over two months and I am still on the first charge! The razor and the extra comb are easy to clean with the included brush, and the razor also comes with a small travel pouch. All in all it meets my needs and I can quickly and easily keep my facial hair even without having to attend to individual areas with clippers.</li>
    <li> Love it. Beard is on point!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these in 2005 and it died in 2013.  I purchased a 7300 model in August 2013 with a vacuum built in.  After 18 months the vacuum door latch broke.  I used it every two weeks and it was not abused so after 18 months it went In the trash!!!  I just bought this one without a vacuum and I bet it will last at least 8 years.  After 6 months of use I&#x27;m disappointed.  It does not cut well and seems too small in the hand.  I have now purchased the 7300 model</li>
    <li> working great an charges also very fast</li>
    <li> Great way to keep the beard evenly trimmed.</li>
</ol>
