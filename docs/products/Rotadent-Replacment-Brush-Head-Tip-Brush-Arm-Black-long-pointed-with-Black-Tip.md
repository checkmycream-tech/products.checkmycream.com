      <li>great product, does just what it is intended to do.</li>
      <li>Great brush.</li>
      <li>Not that happy with the quality of the brissels.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this replacement brush.</li>
      <li>I have been purchasing Rotodent products for many years now.</li>
      <li>Love that it reaches inside areas not reachable with the shorter version.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>with the tip of brush head, you can easily clean top of your teeth close to gum line, so you will not gingivitis.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed!  </li>
      <li>Brush head was great while it lasted, wore out real quick for some reason, only had it for a few weeks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been happy with ZILA brushes in the past.</li>
      <li>I received my brushes, I opened one, loaded it on to my Rotadent and after 3 times use a bunch of brush came off the tip,now the tip looks much skinnier!</li>
      <li>I love my rotadent and have had it for about ten years.  </li>
      <li>but I will not buy another one as I prefer the harder more compact tip.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than buying at my dentist office.  </li>
      <li>I had the older model that had a life time guarantee.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Rotadent Replacement Brush Head for the Rotadent electric toothbrush...</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t fit it tightly, so I did not want to use to damage the machine.</li>
      <li>I bought replacement heads from my dentist directly and from the manufacturer directly.</li>
      <li>The old brushes lasted for 3 months.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly what I expected  </li>
      <li>This new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; model only has a 4 year guarantee.</li>
      <li>This brush barely made 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>This replacement head&#x27;s tip is much softer and not as compact as the other...</li>

    <li> Product was exactly what I expected  I received it on a timely basis.</li>
    <li> I received my brushes, I opened one, loaded it on to my Rotadent and after 3 times use a bunch of brush came off the tip,now the tip looks much skinnier! So I&#x27;m not happy with this product and I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not from ZILA. I&#x27;ve always been happy with ZILA brushes in the past.What am I supposed to do with these 3 brushes?I need to replace these with ZILA brushes.</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t fit it tightly, so I did not want to use to damage the machine.</li>
    <li> I purchased the toothbrush from my dentist. The brushes are cheaper from Amazon than my dentist.</li>
    <li> is my toothbrush of preference.  Much cheaper than buying at my dentist office.  very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I would tell anyone to go and ahead and buy this product. I have been purchasing Rotodent products for many years now. The value it definitely there so don&#x27;t be afraid of purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Love that it reaches inside areas not reachable with the shorter version.</li>
    <li> I love my rotadent and have had it for about ten years.  I used to purchase the replacement heads from my dentist  but can now only find replacement heads online..</li>
    <li> great product, does just what it is intended to do.</li>
    <li> Brush head was great while it lasted, wore out real quick for some reason, only had it for a few weeks and it became disfigured</li>
    <li> Have used them before. Like them lot!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Works to get out everything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the rotadent for several years...I bought replacement heads from my dentist directly and from the manufacturer directly. This replacement head&#x27;s tip is much softer and not as compact as the other...it&#x27;s ok but I will not buy another one as I prefer the harder more compact tip.</li>
    <li> Not that happy with the quality of the brissels. I would not order again online.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Rotadent Replacement Brush Head for the Rotadent electric toothbrush...with the tip of brush head, you can easily clean top of your teeth close to gum line, so you will not gingivitis. I am very satisfied with this replacement brush.</li>
    <li> I have braces and i use this rotadent brush, it can brush to the area that non of the brushes can do the job! I like it! Time consumed! Helps me alot!! The only complaint is that the price since we have to change every 1-2 months since using braces the brush can be no longer in shape!</li>
    <li> I had the older model that had a life time guarantee. This new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; model only has a 4 year guarantee. The old brushes lasted for 3 months. This brush barely made 2 weeks. I stopped using it and bought an electric toothbrush for a lot less money and I get the same results on the gums. The brush lasts for 3 months.</li>
    <li> Did not fit my Rotadent</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!  Works great!</li>
