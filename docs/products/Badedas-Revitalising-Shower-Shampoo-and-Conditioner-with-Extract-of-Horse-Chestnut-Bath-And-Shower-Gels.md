<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The company delivered this product in well under the time they said which was wonderful as I was able to pack it for my trip to Canada (it was part of my mother in laws gift as she cant get it in Canada) Excellent service thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product it seems like forever. Cosmetic&#x27;s Plus was a chain on the East Coast that carried this revitalizing show gel, when they went out of business I bought up all that I could. It&#x27;s been years but I remember the fresh and clean smell that lifts you up. It leaves your skin clean, soft and moisturized. I really nice fragrance that is light, kinda woodsy, fresh. Whenever I get out of the shower I feel, clean moisturized and refresh it wakes me right up.</li>
    <li> Love this product, but this travel size is a deal breaker.  Put out a 32 oz pump bottle and I&#x27;ll be back.  Otherwise it was nice using you, but I won&#x27;t buy this teensy bottle again.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, plus it works well.</li>
    <li> Fresh clean energizing scent</li>
    <li> Everytime I used to visit Nassau, Bahamas, I would come back with all kinds of Badedas Products, sure I could of bought Vitabath in Florida but it&#x27;s so much more expensive than Badedas and its the same product... So when I found badedas online here at Amazon, I couldnt wait to get some for myself and my daughter. I am giving it to my daughter for her birthday, cant wait to see the surprise on her face.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite as a bubble bath soak, I was glad to see it&#x27;s now offered as a shower all-in-one  I&#x27;ve been using the Badedas bath product for years and find the all-in-one great.  Wonderful smell and makes you feel really clean after showering.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We know BADEDAS from Germany but it cheeper in Germany than here in the US It is verey good and we enjoy it</li>
    <li> Best shower product.  Ever</li>
    <li> I like the product, however it is not what I had in mind..I wanted something called  Badadas Cream body wash, but have not been able to find it so I&#x27;m guessing the product is no longer made? This product does have the distinct smell that is good for either gender and it&#x27;s the main reason I chose it. There are many other bath/shower gels on the market but this smell is unique and one I never tire of. I recommend it for a silky, clean experience. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband several years ago for a Christmas gift.  He loves it because of its clean smell.  It is also a multi-purpose -- for body and hair.  I buy at least four at a time so he can have one in his gym bag and one (or more) to keep at home.</li>
    <li> Yay love this will be back for more</li>
    <li> all went well product being usedall went well I like being used</li>
    <li> came in contact with this product over 14yrs ago in 2002...... LOVE EVERYTHING about it.. but was unable to find the products in the stores anymore..&lt;br /&gt;2014..decided to  search on-line...excited to find it again but not for long...&lt;br /&gt;THE QUALITY IS GONE...IT&#x27;S JUST NOT THE SAME.</li>
    <li> I have been searching the web for months to find this shower gel at a great price&#x3D;BINGO  Found with great price. I love this scent for men and women. I have to order more for my husband, in order to keep him away from mine</li>
    <li> I guess I don&#x27;t like the way it smells because it made me want to take another shower and to wash my towels.</li>
    <li> Once you try this product, you&#x27;ll never go back. The only problem is that the contents are limited to a small quantity.</li>
    <li> Very quick, no problem</li>
    <li> This product is exceptionally nice for hair, leaving hair&lt;br /&gt;smooth and feeling natural.  A little bit goes a long way,&lt;br /&gt;which always nice.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it for as long as I can find it!  Just love it!!!</li>
    <li> My wife, who is very very particular and has tried literally dozens of premium hair products prefers Badedas over all of the other shampoos she has ever used (including those provided at the fancy hotels and luxury resorts).</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it.  Would defiitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love Badedas--just not from this company. My order was poorly packaged and leaked all over the place. As it was to be a gift for someone in the same state where they are located I asked that they resend it to that address. They were very nice about it and agreed to do that. It never arrived. When I inquired through Amazon I learned that they had misaddressed the pkg and it had been returned to them. I wonder if they ever would have let me know? So--no Badedas, no present. I&#x27;ll look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of the great feel, fresh smell of Badedas.  Thrilled to find it online, as usually have to ship from some locale in Europe.  Makes the whole bathroom fresh.</li>
    <li> Badedas reminds me of european sower gel scents that somehow smell very clean. I do not know what its basic ingredient is, but it is some great perfume.</li>
    <li> It is good I just think it should be more for the money.</li>
    <li> I love it in the shower. Badedas bubble bath is absolutely the best.</li>
    <li> Pleasant and refreshing product and the seller provided excellent service.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh clean smell. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and smells good for hours.</li>
    <li> My family have always used this in the shower and bath.  Its a clean fresh scent, makes your skin feel great and for me brings back memories of my family.  It can be used for hair, and body which for many guys is convenient and easy. Keep it simple.  I have noticed when I shower or bathe with this and go out, I get asked what I use,  So its lasting.  I think anything that makes you feel good, and doesnt cost the world , is great.</li>
    <li> Luxurious --- I love fragrance -- I&#x27;ve been buying for years</li>
    <li> Do you love the smell of a pine forest in the damp morning or after a rain shower? Then this is the item for you. It just smells so natural.</li>
    <li> We have used this before, and Iove the way it makes your bathroom smell afterwards.  Great smell on hubby, too!</li>
    <li> Okay. I feel the formula has changed. It is not as thick as before and the scent is a little diluted.</li>
    <li> Love this item.  I have used this products for years.  I love it because It has a very refreshing scent.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to someone who had  used it 40 years ago.  I had to buy some more because all he was doing was taking off the top and smelling it instead of washing himself with it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, great price!</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with the size for the  price they charge</li>
    <li> The smell was a bit too strong for me but my husband uses it.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought this product at tj max. Turns out to be the best shower gel we have ever had.  The scent is refreshing and long lasting.  We will always have this in our home</li>
    <li> Beautiful sent stays with me all day from my head to my toes .I only wish the bottle was bigger !!!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for travel.  Love Badedas.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Used this product while in Europe and then returned to US and have used it since returning to US in 1985.</li>
    <li> Awesomel product. Great for my skin and offers a scent that stays with me all day. Great price as well!</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; fantastic product I used for a quite long time. Actually it is my best one.&lt;br /&gt;Try and you&#x27;ll love it too. Its perfect aroma will cherish your day. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Excellent and the fragrance is to die for!  I use it for body wash and for shampoo.  Great when traveling.</li>
    <li> Aroma last a really long time</li>
    <li> It know it is an expensive indulgence but sometimes you just have to spend some money to make yourself feel better and lift your spirits.  This simple product smells great and makes me feel better about facing the day.  So if it is a little expensive, who cares?  This is an indulgence I do for me and personally why save up the money to give it to bunch of ungrateful heirs who will squander it in a minute.  Wow, I vented.  I just like the product and if it is a bit pricey, I am okay with it because the smell just makes me feel good. Badedas is great!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived early, but smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Badedas is my favorite bathing/showering product.  I used this as a shower gel, but would have used it as a shamppo &amp; conditioner except for the fact that I&#x27;m avoiding sodium laurel sulfate shampoos &amp; conditioners.  However, if you haven&#x27;t tried Badedas bath products you are missing a real treat.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. it does make you skin tingle when washing with it and  for a little while after the shower. nice refreshing feeling great for both woman and Men</li>
    <li> Badedas is sold everywhere in Germany, but is hard to find here.  It is a wonderful fir needle scented bath oil and shower gel.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it were sold in the size they sell in Europe instead of tiny six ounce bottles!</li>
    <li> This is the most invigorating fragrance. I often order the shower and bath gel. I saw this and decided I&#x27;d try it but I find it is too harsh on my hair. It still has the great fragrance but I will use as a bath gel. I have fine hair that is color treated, this just isn&#x27;t the right product to use. This fragrance makes me think of the Irish countryside, green hills and stone walls.</li>
    <li> Use daily in shower. Not drying and smells great. Somewhat small size..  Need a larger size...as will need to re- order rather soon.</li>
