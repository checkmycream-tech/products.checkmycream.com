<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This really is a fantastic cleanser! It&#x27;s really quite gentle, but is still able to pull up dirt, oil, and make-up, and leaves no residue on your face afterward. You don&#x27;t need to use much- less than a full pumps worth. It can be a little bit drying, but that&#x27;s likely due to my skin generally being a little on the dry side. If you follow up with moisturizer (I use the Alba Botanica green tea moisturizer during the day, and the thicker jasmine moisturizer at night) you shouldn&#x27;t have any complaints.    I&#x27;m a little confused as to why people are complaining about this stinging the eyes. It shouldn&#x27;t be stinging your eyes unless you&#x27;re WASHING them, which you shouldn&#x27;t be doing in the first place. Always keep cleansers well away from your eyes.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this in the shower.  Works well but seems to be hard to rinse off.  Keep away from the eyes as it will sting.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while and I think it works really well at cleaning without over drying.  You almost want to eat it, it smells so good! I have never had it sting my eyes, as other reviewers have said, and I was surprised to see that.  Price here on Amazon is very good, a couple dollars below Target.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and It&#x27;s love it! It very light and gentle but can remove all my foundation and concealer in seconds. My face feels great and refreshed afterwards. Which is great since I have skin that dries out very easily. I don&#x27;t have that problem with this wash at all. I have to agree though with the other reviewers in that you do have to be careful about it stinging your eyes. I don&#x27;t put it anywhere near my them but occasionally I still get that stinging feeling. I don&#x27;t know if the fragrance or one of the ingredients but it can be irritating.</li>
    <li> I have used this for more than 3 years now and will not use anything else on my skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have combination dry skin in the winter and combination oily skin in th the summer.  It really cleans your pores.&lt;br /&gt;Do not use in your eye area because it stings like hell!&lt;br /&gt;Not for people with dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;Read a review about feeling like a lotion. I think the person mistook this pineapple enzyme cleaner with the coconut one...</li>
    <li> This stuff, as other reviewer noted already, really leaves itchy eyes.  my sister stopped using it because it was way too strong causing skin troubles.  but it&#x27;s alright for me. nice product.</li>
    <li> I see this cleanser has gotten good reviews elsewhere, but this stuff burns my eyes like no cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. It could possibly just be the acidic pineapple/citrus extracts, and so I initially thought it would go away or I&#x27;d get used to it, but it continues to burn my eyes every time. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s really healthy or not.    Other than that, if it doesn&#x27;t kill your eyes or yours happen to be less sensitive than mine, it&#x27;s a good cleanser. The pineapple scent&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love this company and what they stand for- finding them at a great price just sweetens this deal even more. I like this cleanser much more than their other creamy coconut cleanser, it works better for my combination skin. I love the smell, and I can tell that it has removed all of the dirt from my face without drying it out.</li>
    <li> Such a great facial cleanser for my skin. I was recommended by my esthetician to try an enzyme cleanser for my very dry AND very oily skin. Finally, my skin isn&#x27;t as red, dry, oily and painful during winter. The only issue I have is when I wash my face and get some product on my lips, they tend to peel the next day. Just shows the enzyme part really works.</li>
    <li> Amazing for oily, acne prone skin! I have been using Retin A Micro for 8 years which controls my acne about 85% but I need a good cleanser with it to keep my skin completely clear. I&#x27;ve found the &amp;#34;pore purifying&amp;#34; cleansers that work on me usually end up getting discontinued. Love the way this cleanser makes my pores tighten up. Havent found a cleanser that kept my pores this clear since Oil of Olay Pore Refining Mousse which was discontinued around 2008. Neutrogena pink grapefruit scrub works but not anything like this cleanser. Just saw online Alba also makes a pore purifying AHA peel I will be going out to get it tomorrow!!</li>
    <li> Love the product and it&#x27;s much cheaper here than in local stores. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I usually use a coconut oil based face wash but wanted to try something different so I bought this at whole foods. On the first use it completely burned my face &amp; left my face bright red. It appeared as though I had an allergic reaction but it states that it&#x27;s hypo-allergenic... I had to apply coconut oil to my face to help calm it down. My face still feels dried out the next day. Will never buy this product again. Only thing I liked was the smell</li>
    <li> This product cleans off make-up, gently exfoliates the skin and smell great.  Another lovely Alba product at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is another Alba product I love--it cleans thoroughly without being harsh or drying out my face. It has a very light, mild scent that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for people with allergies.  I have them, and I hardly smell it even while I&#x27;m using it. Alba is slowly winning me over. . .I started with the moisturizer and then the shampoo. . . great products!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have been using it about a week or so now, almost every day and I have noticed a marked decrease in dry, flaky skin on my face. So it is exfoliating my facial skin without further drying or irritating it!!...I&#x27;ve actually done double takes at myself  in the mirror a few times because I had become so used to seeing the dry patches or flakes of skin on my face that I wasn&#x27;t used to seeing softer, smoother skin! I am SO glad I bought this! I will continue using it! (and the 2 pack with Amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save discount made each bottle about $7.50 which is cheaper than I could find in any of my local stores so Amazon it will be unless I find a greater deal)  :)  Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Wonderful wash for face.  Little pricey but well worth the money.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other face wash.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I typically use Clinique, but that is so expensive I tried out this product, which I find very comparable and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> this and tea tree face wash are my staples.  I alternate between the two all the time.  it smells great and leaves your skin glowing.  try it with the papaya enzyme mask and the jasmine vit. e day cream.  i fell in love with Alba Haiwain after trying a travel kit.  the kits made it into christmas gifts for my sisters that year. I kid you not- your skin glows.  Best in the summer!!!</li>
    <li> leaves your skin smooth and shiny and gets rid of pimples easily. also it was cheap and it came with two bottles.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. Overall, it leaves my skin soft and it&#x27;s gentle enough for my teenager to use. I recommend it but it&#x27;s not better than Aveda and Aveeno products.</li>
    <li> It certainly doesnt help that the packaging on this product was the only one to leak all over the plastic bag it came in. Not sure what happened there but it was a huge mess and this is VERY soapy soap. This soap does NOT smell good - I have tons of plumeria plants at my house and this one smells NOTHING like them as well as it has a slightly rotting smell to it. I wont be using this and if it wasnt so much work to ship back I would return the product - but since both bottles leaked Im just trashing them - I use thier cocnut conditioner and pineapple scrub mask - both good products.</li>
    <li> A good, inexpensive facial cleanser that does the job just as well as any of the expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried. It really cleans my face and leaves it fresh but doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Smells good too. I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now, and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I had read so many fantastic reviews, I was excited. I have a blackhead problem and was hoping for something fantastic. This wasn&#x27;t it. I think it works just like anything else you can find at the grocery store. Nothing magical here.</li>
    <li> Cleans well. The scent is mild and fresh.</li>
    <li> Meant to order this one in the creamy coconut.  I don&#x27;t like this one at all.  Leaves skin feeling dry. I wonder if it&#x27;s meant for oily skin.  Would not order again. Problem is, I&#x27;m stuck with two.  Maybe I can exchange.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every facial cleanser out there.  I have combination skin (I&#x27;m in my late &#x27;40s....).  Some made my skin too dry, others didn&#x27;t cleanse very deeply.  THIS cleanser by Alba does it all. Cleanses deeply and gently, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  I use it with my Clarisonic every single day.</li>
    <li> Does not dry my skin out, smells delicious and works well the their toner which is fabulous also</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanica Pineapple Enzyme Facial Cleanser for several years now and it always does a great job and leaves my face feeling refreshed. This was my first time ordering this cleanser from Amazon and while it still works great, I have noticed some differences between this product and the one that I buy at Whole Foods or Target. First, the smell is different, not bad, just different, as well as the texture. I saw that a couple of people mentioned that it hurts their eyes, and I have to agree with that. I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my eyes, but occasionally the cleanser will run into my eyes while rinsing and it definitely stings, which has never happened to me with this product before. I don&#x27;t know why the formula would be different, but it seems like it is. But, again, it still works great, and if you can deal with the stinging eyes then it&#x27;s great deal. I just thought it was worth mentioning that it isn&#x27;t exactly like the product that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap based on the advice of a makeup artist friend, I have combination skin so I need something that won&#x27;t over moisturize or dry me out too much. I have the added difficulty of having extremely sensitive skin so that every other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used has caused actual open wounds on my face. Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this from Amazon, it shipped and arrived fast but one of the bottles broke open in shipping and the entire bottle leaked all over the inside of the package. At least the package was clean, I guess. But I notified Amazon and they gave me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this every day since I got it and my face isn&#x27;t breaking out or over dry. I don&#x27;t have redness or open wounds on my face, and my oil is a little more under control. I use this every morning with a Clarisonic Mia, it buffs away everything I don&#x27;t want without leaving behind any buildup I also don&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> will buy again pineapple is good for the skin good if you oily skin smells good ,good price for 2 bottles .</li>
    <li> Too soapy, makes my skin dry, does not really remove make-up , I love this brand but this one falls short</li>
    <li> My wife loves the Alba line. The items we bought are great. But they arrived semi opened with damage to the packaging.  The gray bag and the box the items arrived in were intact but the face cream lid was cracked and the face cleanser lid was unscrewed and a few ounces leaked out.</li>
    <li> Been using this line for 2 years now and it is perfect for my oily skin. I don&#x27;t break out and the best part is the smell! Love it!</li>
    <li> My spouse loves this product for her face.  I like the scent.</li>
    <li> For the past 2 years, I&#x27;ve only purchased products that are not tested on animals, as well as contains at least 70% vegetarian ingredients.  I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t discover Alba Botanica any earlier.  I&#x27;ve used numerous facial cleansers, both over-the-counter products, as well as products that were recommended from dermatologists.  This is probably the best over-the-counter facial cleanser out there. It does an excellent job of cleansing your face nicely, it is very gentle for your skin.  I use this every night, to clean my face (with make-up).  The impression is that if you have mascara, you really should buy a separate cleanser which its main job is to clean the mascara, so if you&#x27;re hoping for this product to completely wipe out the mascara, it won&#x27;t do that - it will clean it very nicely, but you&#x27;ll have to go over your eyes with a warm, soft cloth to take off the mascara completely.  I also use this product to clean my make-up brushes, which it does an excellent job.  Overall, I won&#x27;t need to look anywhere else to purchase another cleanser - it&#x27;s cruelty-free, it does a great job and it is an extremely reasonable priced item.</li>
    <li> I tried my GF&#x27;s bottle when I ran out of my soap and realized that the following day my razor bumps were reduced. I then experimented using it each time either before or after shaving and found that I have not been getting ANY razor bumps for the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also sometimes get clogged pores in my armpits with my deodorant so I tried it there and works like a charm. No more annoying bumps. Yeah yeah I know it&#x27;s only intended for the face but have also used it successfully elsewhere where I have a pimple or clogged pore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is great for anywhere you may shave or have potential for ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Worked for me!  Wonderful fragrance too!!  Face feels smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> My new favorite face wash. Smells great, no harsh chemicals, and completely removes all make up. Great price too! Very happy and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Alba Botanica&#x27;s pineapple enzyme facial cleanser for a long time and find it to be a very good product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice facial cleanser, I tried it after being happy with their body lotion.  It smells great and does the trick. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Love the suds and love the way it makes my face feel. Just be careful around your eyes and rinse well because even the fumes can make them water.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and always have to wash my face daily.I use a salicylic acid product everyday,so when my face gets dry and sensitive I use this cleanser with a Buf Puf or a cotton pad.It evens out and brightens my complexion,with refining some of my large pores.My daughter is starting to use this,it has cleared her mild acne evened out her complexion really good.Before she had blotchy area&#x27;s of uneven skin tone of dark and light.It made it all 1 tone.So yes it works pretty well and definitely would keep repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite - my skin has been amazing since using it!</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash. My boyfriend and I use this; he has oily skin, I have normal skin, and it does a great job cleaning our faces without leaving our skin dry or oily. We switched over from clearasil, and we&#x27;ve been using this face wash ever since for 5 months straight now.</li>
    <li> Only kind of cleaned the skin, but some makeup was still left on the skin. Made me break out. Once i switched cleansers, the breakouts  improved. Bad smell, smells like chemicals. Only positive side is that it is natural.</li>
    <li> Really really like this product. Enzymes good for the skin, very fragrant with pineapple. Non-drying, good quality and good price.</li>
    <li> I have combination-dry skin.  I use the Alba cleanser at night and the Cerave moisturizing cleanser in the morning.  Something about the fruit enzymes in this cleanser makes it crazy easy to take off all my makeup - I know, I know, cleanser shouldn&#x27;t really be used for that - and exfoliates just enough to make me have a soft glow, but not get dried out or red or flaky.  I want to say I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 or 5 years now, and I still love it.  I also always follow with a nighttime moisturizer, currently Night-A-Mins by Origins.</li>
    <li> When I got the cleansers in the mail I wasn&#x27;t too happy that they exploded, however they were in a plastic bag so clean up was easy and I didn&#x27;t lose a lot of the product. The product itself is great! It smells good, it lathers nicely, and it tingles( not in a omg my face is going to burn off kind of way, but in a cooling way). I use this with an olay cleaning tool(highly recommended).</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. It works well on my oily areas without overdrying in others. Like the company ethos of keeping it natural and no animal testing with recycled material bottles.</li>
    <li> Love this face cleanser, especially in the morning. It smells fresh and awakens my skin. Feels good going on. Great value too.</li>
    <li> No.  Nope.  Nada.  No Way.  No How.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this facial cleanser.  It smells really good.  I try to live naturally and organically as much as humanly possible; but this wash is just too harsh for my delicate skin.  My face became dry and cracked within the first use.  I had to Shea butter it down to bring it back to its calm state.  So no, no, no, no, no.  I cannot use this.  The surfactants in here are not good for my skin.  Alba definitely should seek out gentler surfactants for facial use.  I love Earth Science way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I thought that this would be a good buy, I purchased pack of two.  Oh Well, at least I have liquid hand soap for the near future.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cleanser.  Feels very natural.</li>
    <li> These products are outstanding I will continue to use. The smell good and are good for your skin. No Artificial Parabens. Thanks</li>
    <li> My wife orders it. She mentioned it is really an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a face soap to replace my purpose since they test on animals.  I really like this cleanser. It is best for oily to semi oily skin and has a great smell.  You don&#x27;t need much to clean your face and it lasts for a while.  My skin has noticably softer and less of that soap feel that I got before. I loved purpose and have used it for 15 years so I was very happy with the results of this product. I highly recommend. I have olive colored skin and my mom is fair and we both love this stuff.</li>
    <li> It is perfect for my skin..Not oily and not too harsh. I love it</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and tried this product because I use their Aloe &amp; Green Tea Oil Free Moisturizer.  I love the fact that this product does not dry out my skin.  I am an African-American woman with a T-zone. Oily around the nose and forhead and dry around the checks.  This product works great for me.</li>
    <li> The light scent is pleasing and the ingredients exactly as promised. My face feels clean and invigorating.  You should definitely try it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s a must have. It thoroughly cleanses my face. It&#x27;s made with organic/natural ingredients. It&#x27;s totally affordable. In fact, you get 2 bottles for the price of 1. And, as an added bonus, it has a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for th ed past 10 years...Nothing better...Cleans really well without stripping my skin of moisture.</li>
    <li> Works great and cheaper then local store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for 2 weeks. Works really well at removing dirt, oil, and make-up. I use it on my back too! My skin looks a little brighter and I have not had any breakouts. It does make my cheeks slightly dry right after washing, but my moisturizer is dealing with it just fine. I am surprised to hear other reviewers say it smells good...I don&#x27;t think so at all. Does not smell like pineapple nor does it remind me of Hawaii. In fact, it smells &#x27;chemically&#x27; to me and reminds me of Windex! Yeah, kind&#x27;a weird, I know!</li>
    <li> I have adult acne prone skin. I first learned about this product from someone on YouTube, so I decided to try it. At first my face hurt a little, like a mild chemical peel, it left my skin very soft and clean and not too dry. I really love this product, I&#x27;m no longer breaking out and my acne scar have cleared up some. I would recomend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love the enzyme exfoliant rather than having a scrub.  My face tends to suffer from redness, and an aesthetician recommended an enzyme exfoliant.  I love the way this feels and smells.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before but could no longer find it locally.  I like how it makes my skin feel when I wash my face with it, and it&#x27;s the best shaving product I think I&#x27;ve ever tried.  There&#x27;s no skin irritation and the hair seems to take longer to grow back, and it seems less coarse.</li>
    <li> It amazes me how this is practically a five star rating product. It has the consistency of lotion. I feel like I&#x27;m washing my Face with lotion. Then when I rinse it for - like ever my face feels tacky as though it left a sticky residue. Then it&#x27;s like my&lt;br /&gt;Face gets oilyz If it&#x27;s not cleaning foaming bubbling on my face and it&#x27;s leaving a sick sticky feeling on it too then all I have to say is I don&#x27;t reccomened it. But everyone has different skin. I just thought it sucked and luckily for me I got it at a health food store for 12.99. But still I can&#x27;t get that back. I won&#x27;t be purchasing from this company. I gave it two stars because it smelt tropical and amazing.</li>
    <li> After trying a myriad of facial cleansers, from the most expensive department store brands to the usual Oil of Olay and Neutrogena, i decided to give this a go. This cleanser leaves your skin feeling very clean and washes off completely, unlike some other soaps that tend to leave a residue. I have combination skin with extremely dry everywhere except the T-zone, which tends to be slightly oily. This cleanser seems to balance out my skin perfectly, leaving my skin just clean, not dried out or overly moisturized. my only gripe about this product is that the smell isn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;pineapple&amp;#34;...it&#x27;s got a bit of a strange pineapple smell, but not bad.</li>
    <li> Pineapple and papaya enzymes are great acids for those with sensitive skin.  This product is great for daily exfoliation and the price is excellent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this product does,  It is useless and takes up room on the shower caddy.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with an oily t-zone, and I am prone to breakouts around period.  This face wash is great because it&#x27;s sensitive enough for days when my skin is perfect and strong enough for breakout days.  My face feels oil-free after using but not so dried out that it will overcompensate and make even more oil.  It smells yummy too!  Also, it&#x27;s all natural and I love that it was not tested on animals.  I use lots of Alba products and I have yet to find one I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used nice and astringent excellent cleaning properties. I work with lots of chemicals (Spray painting) &amp; have found this product excellent do your self a favor &amp; checkout the full alba range.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face wash. Really the best I have ever used. No greasy residue, it removes ALL my make-up, keeps my face AND my Olay Pro-X face brush very clean! I use it both morning and night along with my face brush and my skin has been pimple free and clear. Sometimes my face feels dry after washing with this product (probably b/c I use the face brush) but I put Argan oil on to moisturize and it feels wonderful :)</li>
    <li> Smells nice ( Yum yum) and works well. Great price for package of two!It does the job well.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser, it lathers up well, removes makeup and is not drying.  The price is very reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> My wife bought one of these a year ago and we simply got hooked. She just told me &amp;#34;you gotta try this&amp;#34; and so glad i did. The feel of the skin after cleaning it through is so refreshing and also the smell is great (and not girly at all). I&#x27;d recommend it to any one with oily skin. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this face cleaner.  Leaves face smooth and clean without stripping</li>
    <li> Daughter uses this cream and loves it.  Its very expensive in the Brick and Mortar stores and is much cheaper to buy online, usually in quantities of two or more.</li>
    <li> This face wash always makes my face feel sqeaky clean without harsh chemicals or over drying my face.  It has a pleasant smell.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a film afterwards like some cream cleansers.  It is a clear, foam forming formula.  All round great product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Alba Botanica products for SOOO many reasons, including CRUELTY-FREE and PARABEN-FREE offerings. I use their Coconut Milk Facial Wash for my face &amp; also for my nethers! It&#x27;s a real treat for dry skin. My skin loves ALBA like my mouth loves Ice Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Pinapple Enzyme cleanser once when my source was out of stock on the coconut cleanser. I like the fragrance, but I agree with the reviewer who reported that it burned the eyes like crazy! So much so that I had to stop using it for my face. I have combination skin and the Pineapple product leaves my skin clean, but tight &amp; dry outside the T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, having recently spent a lot of time in Arizona wearlng open shoes in the heat &amp; dust, I have found that this product is AWESOME for removing grime from your feet! I also like it as a handwash. So I&#x27;m keeping it in stock for those uses!</li>
    <li> Cleans well.  Very drying.</li>
    <li> I am sure the product would havr worked great but the lids had loosened during shipment and they spilled ruining the entire package.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good at cleaning my face. no complaints. i like the nelson&#x27;s better, though (but the alba botanica smells nicer).</li>
    <li> The skin on my face easily dries out starts to appear almost flakey or shows noticeable speckles of dry skin. Most face cleansers don&#x27;t prevent this from happening. I had been using hydrocortisone creams, these work if I apply it 3 times a week, but I have to deal with a greasy feeling face all day on those days. This stuff clears up my flake skin and my face feels clean afterward! I&#x27;m really glad I started using this stuff. I originally got it at Walmart, but my local store doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
    <li> Right now my face looks like chewed food. This soap burned my face, what more can I say.  My face hurts when I talk. I put aloe vera gel to sooth my cheeks, but the side of my nose is still fire right now.  This hurts and looks so bad....I had to cancel my plans for tomorrow.  I will not go outside looking like this, I hope my face heals.  I have never experienced anything like this before and I truly don&#x27;t know what to expect. BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and I really enjoy it. It smells very nice and I feel like it cleanses my face very thoroughly. I cannot use this more than once a day because it can dry your skin out a bit if you aren&#x27;t careful. Other wise it&#x27;s great and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find a single thing about this face wash I don&#x27;t love. The easy lather texture. The amazing tropical scent. The fact that it removes all traces of my makeup, sunscreen, and the days dirt and grime. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or tight. My skin comes away soft, smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle is excellent, it dispenses just enough, and I can do a half pump if needed!&lt;br /&gt;Not all face washes are created equal, and this has beat the expensive department store face washes I was using... at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Probably not for the those with sensitive skin - if you aren&#x27;t aware of the role of fruit enzymes in skin care, do some research before you order. Nice cleanser with great ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smells great, cleans great and gentle on skin.  Second time ordering...love the 2pack option.</li>
    <li> I find this cleanser to be rather drying.</li>
    <li> This product makes your skin brighten and soft. I will use until I find something I like better.</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  I&#x27;m picky about face cleansers.  They have to work well and smell good -- and help mature skin.  This does all of that.  I plan to order again.  I&#x27;ve found very few cleansers that I have purchased twice.  This is an exception.  I feel that it gives me a deep cleanse and makes my skin look brighter.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Previously I was using the yes to cucumbers milk cleanser cleans face and makeup. This one does the same thing and I found it creates a richer lather, more foamy. Cleanses face and takes off makeup and its gentle on the skin. Its in my favorite cleansers list!</li>
    <li> Very good cleanser , great price came quick.</li>
    <li> This cleanser smells divine and works very well to clean my skin.  Not the best at removing eye make-up, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to do so, so that&#x27;s not a drawback.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> Stuff is great, but for me it really bothers my eyes when it gets near them. Not in the eyes, but anywhere nears my eyes bothers me. But it refreshes my face for sure, and is fine with my skin.</li>
    <li> This works well and it is nice to have pump bottle.  Goes a long way only need a bit to wash face.</li>
