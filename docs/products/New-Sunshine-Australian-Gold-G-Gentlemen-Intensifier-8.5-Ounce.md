      <li>Very moisturizing</li>
      <li>Suspiciously Smells exactly the same as the G Gentlemen after tan lotion that you can get for $20 at a tanning salon.</li>

    <li> Only thing that works for me!</li>
    <li> Used for 2 weeks and no results.  Suspiciously Smells exactly the same as the G Gentlemen after tan lotion that you can get for $20 at a tanning salon. Worst intensifier I&#x27;ve ever used in regards to results. I guess that&#x27;s the risk you take when you buy online. Spend the extra 20 bucks and buy from your tanning salon. At least you know what you&#x27;re getting is legit. Also the G Gentlemen bronzer is a much better product in regards to seeing results.</li>
    <li> As described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different tanning lotions, this one smells great!  It is NOT greasy which is important to me.  It also has NO bronzer, which is also what I was looking for!  I also like that it is a very generously sized tube, I can handle it well even though my hands are a little slippery, and I&#x27;ll be able to use it to the last squeeze with not much waste!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> This does an amazing job! I have been using it the past 3 weeks and is a great intensifier. Also this is an intensifier not a bronzer so don&#x27;t expect immediate results. After around three tanning session I could tell a difference. The smell is also great! I have gotten so many complements from everyone. It&#x27;s a men&#x27;s cologne smell and not too heavy compared to other similar products just the right amount to notice when close but not overwhelming. Also make sure to let the product soak in for around 15 minutes before to get the best results. But fantastic product, would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This item does NOT meet my expectations. I&#x27;ve given it three weeks and it does nothing more than any cheapo moisturizer would do from the pharmacy (aside from smelling like  a $2 stick of deodorant). There is ZERO noticeable change in the color and/or tone of my skin from this product as I&#x27;ve been tanning for 4 or 5 months now. I&#x27;m astounded they charge $35 for this thing at the store let alone the $17 I wasted here.</li>
    <li> Works great, has decent smell, not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I typically only tan in the summer time in high pressure beds. This stuff smells amazing. Not necessarily manly but clean, much better than coming out smelling like burnt cocoa butter. It&#x27;s super moisturizing and my tattoos haven&#x27;t sustained any damage (my main reason for buying was the tattoo protection). I definitely tan more evenly with this too.</li>
    <li> I got this lotion very quickly and have been very pleased with the results&lt;br /&gt;so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasing with a musky hint to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The darker results just after one session&lt;br /&gt;were very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of using this, people that I&#x27;ve seen in the salon for a couple of months in a row started asking me what lotion I was using.&lt;br /&gt;They noticed the results, and I told them where to buy it cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;The salon wanted $50+ dollars for this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this lotion again.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good,  40$ cheaper then in local tanning salons.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels legit. Have noticed results.</li>
    <li> Not the best tanning lotion. Kinda smells like cheap cologne &amp; farts after tanning session. End result, waste of money. Sorry Australian Gold, step ur game up.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I Used this with my ruby tingle to see if it helped that tan smell,  totally did,  the scent is unisex,  not manly or girly. Very moisturizing</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. Using it for under a week got me darker way faster and at a fourth of the cost of the upscale brands.</li>
    <li> This works great. I don&#x27;t like bronzers because they come off in salt water and then you&#x27;re left with a blotchy tan. This works perfectly for tanning without any bronzer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for 2 months it works great I tan easily in summer but wanted a jump on the season. I&#x27;m as dark as if it were August. Smell good also. Contains no bronzers so no \\&quot;fake\\&quot; color.I got a 2ndjump tube on its way.</li>
    <li> This smells good. I got it for my husband. He used it 3 times at in the tanning bed and got a rash from it. He doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin either, so it was kind of weird. We didn&#x27;t get to see if it does anything that it said it did since he only used it to few times.</li>
    <li> exceeded my expectations!  this product is so good that I want to use it everyday not just on tanning days.</li>
