### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works flawlessly even producing a finer spray.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome.</li>
      <li>All told I&#x27;m impressed with this product and will be repurchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great product and Great Company!</li>
      <li>Umm perfect smell, great for the shower and lingers into the hallway.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I eventually bought spray bottles and poured the eucalyptus oil into those, so now it&#x27;s all good!  </li>
      <li>However, what impressed me the most about Euro Spa is their excellent customer service.</li>
      <li>The eucalyptus oil is still great.  </li>
      <li>This works great for a steam room.</li>
      <li>great for bedtime excitement</li>
      <li>the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work - but it smells great.</li>
      <li>The exhilarating scent is great to start your morning.</li>
      <li>I use the Eucalyptus oil every day and love it!</li>
      <li>While it is quite potent (I got carried away with my spraying), I did find the scent dissipated in about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something about the Eucalyptus scent that is so refreshing</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I discovered this product.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>So it is just OK yet</li>
      <li>I would love to see a &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I am pleased I have this</li>
      <li>and I am thrilled it is 100% pure oil.  </li>
      <li>It is OK yet just not as refreshing as say the spa or even some oil drops I got at Whole Foods.  </li>
      <li>suspect it&#x27;ll last a good while as the bottle is quite</li>
      <li>This is powerful and is identical smelling to what they have in the gym steam room.</li>
      <li>I heard that Eucalyptus oil was a natural mold and mildew inhibitor in addition to the healthy benefits we receive from using the mist.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you enjoy the smell of eucalyptus.  </li>
      <li>After enjoying eucalyptus oil fragrance in the Ritz Carlton Kapalua steam room, I wanted to take some home with me and see how similar the experience was.  </li>
      <li>It even came with two spray tops, probably in case the first one didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>I run water in the shower until hot then just spray the oil one or two times into the hot mist.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the pure eucalyptus oil from Euro Spa.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have to use much at all to get the effect.</li>
      <li>I can highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Highly concentrated.</li>
      <li>need to transfer it to a new bottle.</li>
      <li>I have to get up very early in the morning for my job and</li>
      <li>It produces the steam vapor of the scent we wanted where it gets up high enough (while seated on a bench) to really breathe in and clear out your airways.</li>
      <li>Sprayer is very cheaply made and broke after only a few uses.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked in my home shower.  </li>
      <li>A few spritzes into the steam at the beginning of the shower and several more during it</li>
      <li>I was really surprised at how little I needed to use to get the full effect of the spray.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps EuroSpa should consider offer a lever operated bottle and refills instead of hanging in there with a poor delivery system notwithstanding the two top solution.</li>
      <li>When I called the customer service rep answered the phone on 2 rings and apologized and I received the right sized sprayers via UPS a few days later.</li>
      <li>The product was delivered in a few days and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sprayer is very cheaply made and broke after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at how little I needed to use to get the full effect of the spray.  I decided to use it as a pre shower mist.  I let the shower fill up with steam before getting in, then sprayed the mist into the steam.  Then I just breathed in the smell through the slightly opened shower door.  Later I added a few sprays during my shower.  This is powerful and is identical smelling to what they have in the gym steam room.</li>
    <li> I ordered the pure eucalyptus oil from Euro Spa. The product was delivered in a few days and it was exactly what I wanted. The only issue is that they provided the wrong size sprayers. However, what impressed me the most about Euro Spa is their excellent customer service. When I called the customer service rep answered the phone on 2 rings and apologized and I received the right sized sprayers via UPS a few days later. Great product and Great Company!</li>
    <li> I heard that Eucalyptus oil was a natural mold and mildew inhibitor in addition to the healthy benefits we receive from using the mist. While it is quite potent (I got carried away with my spraying), I did find the scent dissipated in about 20 minutes. All told I&#x27;m impressed with this product and will be repurchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect it&#x27;ll last a good while as the bottle is quite large.&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest starting out with just a few sprays in your shower and adjusting usage accordingly. The steam from your shower magnifies the scent as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to this. I find it so soothing, that I not only use it in the shower, I now spray it on my pillow before bed. It&#x27;s transporting.</li>
    <li> The eucalyptus oil is still great.  The problem has always has been with the sprayer bottle. I am updating my review (not the number of stars) because EuroSpa did address the problem with the sprayer bottle in a crude but effective way.  Instead of providing the product as before--one bottle with a sprayer top--they provide it now with one bottle and TWO sprayer tops.  I guess that is an improvement.  I would not know because I simply purchased a $4 8oz lever operated sprayer bottle from Amazon used by beauty salons. Transferred the oil from EuroSpa&#x27;s bottle to it and  It works flawlessly even producing a finer spray.  Perhaps EuroSpa should consider offer a lever operated bottle and refills instead of hanging in there with a poor delivery system notwithstanding the two top solution.</li>
    <li> This eucalyptus oil is just as it was described in the customer reviews.  It even came with two spray tops, probably in case the first one didn&#x27;t work.  Unfortunately for me, each of the two spray tops only worked the first time.  I eventually bought spray bottles and poured the eucalyptus oil into those, so now it&#x27;s all good!  I use the Eucalyptus oil every day and love it!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked in my home shower.  After enjoying eucalyptus oil fragrance in the Ritz Carlton Kapalua steam room, I wanted to take some home with me and see how similar the experience was.  A few spritzes into the steam at the beginning of the shower and several more during it made my shower a \\&quot;spa experience!\\&quot;  I can highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work - but it smells great. need to transfer it to a new bottle.</li>
    <li> We got some Eucalyptus shower bombs and this spray to compare. The spray is the winner... hands down. It produces the steam vapor of the scent we wanted where it gets up high enough (while seated on a bench) to really breathe in and clear out your airways.</li>
    <li> I run water in the shower until hot then just spray the oil one or two times into the hot mist.  The exhilarating scent is great to start your morning. I&#x27;ve been adding it to my shower everyday for a few weeks and used only around 15% of the bottle. Highly recommended if you enjoy the smell of eucalyptus.  I would love to see a &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; shower mist product for evening showers...</li>
    <li> It does the job in the steam shower.  Just go in and breathe deep!</li>
    <li> I am pleased I have this and I am learning no more than 2 sprays as the smell is not what I really like.  It is OK yet just not as refreshing as say the spa or even some oil drops I got at Whole Foods.  So it is just OK yet at least I have it and get a little of that spa feeling at home.</li>
    <li> Highly concentrated. Two sprays was all that was needed for the steam room.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It&#x27;s a must buy.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I discovered this product.  I have to get up very early in the morning for my job and a couple of sprays in my shower steam seems to help me wake up.  There&#x27;s something about the Eucalyptus scent that is so refreshing and I am thrilled it is 100% pure oil.  Hopefully it will make climbing out of bed on a cold Minnesota winter morning easier!</li>
    <li> This works great for a steam room. Don&#x27;t have to use much at all to get the effect. Should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it at the gym in the steam room. You can use it at home in the shower, but gym steam room works for me. Get a small spray bottle, transfer some to that and it becomes portable. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Umm perfect smell, great for the shower and lingers into the hallway.&lt;br /&gt;Also great for bedtime excitement</li>
