<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Weleda has been around the European market for quite some time and they offer high quality organic skin care products that work. This diaper cream rash works effectively to soothe the skin and contrary to other brands that contain mineral oil, this one does not. It let&#x27;s the skin breathe. I have used this cream for more than 5 years and it has always worked! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is THE holy grail of diaper creams.  \\&quot;Butt Paste\\&quot; can&#x27;t hold a candle to Weleda&#x27;s.  If my baby girl even has a hint of redness this cream will get rid of it in one application.  Sure, this diaper cream is more expensive than most but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great product. I haven&#x27;t experienced any rash issues since using this product.</li>
    <li> Great diaper cream..very thick and smooths easily.</li>
    <li> This cream has always taken care of redness at the first application for us. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have petroleum in it. I use cloth diapers and don&#x27;t have any problems with staining unless day care globs it on his bum. The few times that they did that, the discoloration came out in a couple of washes. But it is totally unnecessary to use more than a pea sized amount. A tube of this stuff will last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> Judging from diaper rash cream reviews it is clear the same thing does not work for everyone.  We have a two month old who is exclusively breastfed and wears mostly cloth diapers (Fuzzybuns and Bumgenius).  We&#x27;ve been able to avoid any serious rashes but have had some occasional redness which we have addressed successfully using three products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used the [[ASIN:B0021HR94K Earth Mama Angel Baby Angel Baby Bottom Balm, 2-Ounce Jar]] along with organic coconut oil as a preventative/maintenance cream for when the bottom is not red or there is only a slight pinkness since the Bottom Balm will not clear up the more serious redness in our experience.  For the handful of times our baby has gotten a more serious redness we have switched temporarily to Wedela and/or Burt&#x27;s Bees (see below).  However, for most diaper changes we only use the Bottom Balm, which is a wonderful product that is safe for cloth diapers and leaves the bottom silky soft and 90% of the time it is enough to keep our baby&#x27;s bottom redness-free and soft.  It is not a thick white cream but more like a jar of oily lip balm.  The jar is small but you only need a very small amount as the balm spreads very easily.  It smells a little \\&quot;herby\\&quot; but not in a bad way (in my opinion) and you don&#x27;t smell it once the diaper is on anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more pronounced redness we have successfully used this cream (the [[ASIN:B000V4813S Weleda Baby Calendula Diaper Care Cream]]) as well as the [[ASIN:B0014AEXUI Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee Diaper Ointment, 3 Ounce]].  Both these creams have cleared up redness in only a few applications, often only in one application.  These creams are more akin to the traditional thick white (wetness-barrier) diaper creams most of us grew up with.  Both the Weleda cream and the Burt&#x27;s Bees cream have worked quickly and effectively on redness but I understand they are not safe to use with cloth diapers (they will stain them and/or affect absorbancy) so to avoid ruining our cloth diapers we switch to a disposable diaper if we need to clear up redness. (Chlorine-free diaper brands such as Seventh Generation, Earth&#x27;s Best, and Whole Foods 365 are some brands we have tried and like).  Because of the thickness and incompatibility with cloth diapers we only use the thicker creams as needed.  We also still use a disposable diaper for the overnight stretch and using the Weleda overnight has prevented wetness-caused rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These three products have been essential in keeping our baby smooth, rash-free, and comfortable!diapers we switch to a disposable diaper if we need to clear up redness.

    <li> I only use Weleda products for my son and he has never had a diaper rash. I simply wash his diaper area with a washcloth and water in the morning and at night (I use wipes for diaper changes) and apply a thin layer of Weleda diaper cream. He has wonderful skin. I buy this for all new Moms that I know and they all love it, too.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  When either one of my twins get diaper rash, I put this on them and it&#x27;s gone with in 24 hours.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best baby diaper cream. We&#x27;ve tried all the major brands, including Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, and California Baby, and this stuff is thicker and easier to spread than the others. Our baby had a terrible diaper rash that wasn&#x27;t going away, even after a full week of keeping Desitin on the baby. 24 hours after using Weleda Calendula, the diaper rash was almost completely gone.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my litlle boy and he never had a rush o red skin. I love this product</li>
    <li> Bought this just to try. Wasn&#x27;t particularly dissatisfied with previous cream. It is a small tube but cream is thick and lasted 3 months. Baby&#x27;s butt looked great. When it ran out I decided to go back to old cream since it&#x27;s cheaper. After a week of that, baby&#x27;s butt is pink and I&#x27;m reordering weleda. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I tried several different diaper cream when my daughter had diaper rash, and this is one of them. I liked the fact that this is all natural. However, I think she had thrush on her butt, so none of these cream worked and I actually had to use anti-fungal cream, which worked great.  So I don&#x27;t know if this cream worked or not. My friend told me that she used this as a preventative care, though I in general didn&#x27;t put any cream if my daughter&#x27;s butt was perfect.  If I had used this, wouldn&#x27;t she get diaper rash? I don&#x27;t know...</li>
    <li> We tried at least 10 different creams to clear up our son&#x27;s horrible diaper rash.  None seemed to work at all until we tried Weleda.  It&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it. Others have commented on the smell--I think it has a nice scent without being over-powering.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product.  We use nothing else on our Child.  We have found Weleda to be a very gentle, and very effective Skin Care Cream for Diaper Rash, or really for any kind of rash or skin irritation found on our Infant Child.  We use Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food for our hands which is how we learned of it for Babies to begin with.  This Seller has adequate delivery time and packaging.</li>
    <li> Only cream we use even the adults in our house use sometimes.  Never a baby rash with this cream .</li>
    <li> Nice soothing cream. I use it too, works great for diaper rash, allergy/sensitivity rashes. I love Weleda products and like that you can actually read the ingredients. The baby toothpaste is nice, too!</li>
    <li> Works great and it&#x27;s cloth diaper friendly!</li>
    <li> Best diaper cream. We tried other creams found at natural food stores &amp; baby exhibited no redness when we used this. Strong calendula smell, which initially worried me.  But turned out great. Prompt delivery, no seller issues. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. All natural and does a very good job at protecting babys bottom</li>
    <li> Better than all the other less-toxic alternatives and very cost effective. Better than the crystal, better than coconut oil/baking soda, better than the other processed deodorants. I don&#x27;t have a baby, but I do smell sweet and clean.</li>
    <li> Great product for babies that have semsetive skin.</li>
    <li> The item we received is different from the order. We ordered Baby diaper care cream but received Baby and Child diaper care cream. The latter is priced much cheaper than the former at Amazon. The return is a hassle.</li>
    <li> We use as preventative care, and haven&#x27;t seen a rash yet! We like the packaging it comes in, it&#x27;s easy to get the cream out. Smells nice and it&#x27;s nice knowing the product is all natural and safe for our little guy</li>
    <li> I use so much less of this than I did with Desitin. It works great and helps with any redness right away.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I get this for all new parents. Baby has a touch of diaper rash. Put this on it. Gone the next day. It is magic. I got mine from my friend in Germany but I guess that the German and US formulas are the same.</li>
    <li> I trust this brand. Its clean and pure and does what its supposed to. Nuff said!</li>
    <li> The baby care calendula cream seriously works miracles.  it makes all skin blemishes, marks, scratches, everything, disappear within a few hours.  this is a MUST for any baby.  the diaper cream works very well also.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice product. I wouldn&#x27;t normally spend more for something like this but it smells so nice and has a great creamy feel rather than pasty. Plus it works!  One application is often enough to cure redness</li>
    <li> This creamy zinc based ointment is soft and creamy, clears up rashes quickly and is so pleasant to smell.  I actually like to put diaper cream on!</li>
    <li> This is the best product we&#x27;ve tried for this purpose. Seems to heal up overnight.</li>
    <li> My favorite diaper rash cream!  Fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product from amazon.  But I wanted to write a review about this cream and hence I am writing here.  We used several rash creams (12 different types) for our 1 month old baby and we tried them until her 3rd month with very minor improvement or no improvement.  When we tried this weleda baby calendula diaper cream (I bought from WholeFoods store; but it does not matter, you can buy from amazon), the rash went off in 1.5 days.  We are really happy that we tried this cream.  I will suggest this for every parent.</li>
    <li> My newborn son had the WORST diaper rash at 3 weeks old.  We tried EVERYTHING- Hydrocerin, then TriplePaste, then Budreux&#x27;s Butt Paste, then Burt&#x27;s...to no avail.  Got this, and literally in less than 24 hours it was almost clear and he no longer screamed when wiped.  I now use it exclusively.  There is an \\&quot;herby\\&quot; fragrance, but as someone who is VERY sensitive to perfumes/scents (give me instant migraines), this scent does not bother me at all.  And especially when I know it keeps his little bottom so perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret buying this!</li>
    <li> Best diaper cream ever.Swear by it</li>
    <li> This cream is great - a nice smell and the Calendula really helps with rash where the zinc fails.</li>
    <li> By far the best diaper cream on the market ... This is my go to baby gift for other moms.</li>
    <li> The best baby cream in the market!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had problems with diaper rash since using this cream!</li>
    <li> We had been using this product for a long time and just loved it. Will certainly buy some more from this store due to delivery time and price.</li>
