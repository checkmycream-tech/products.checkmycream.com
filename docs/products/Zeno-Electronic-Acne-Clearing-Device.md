### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Although all of the products have helped, Zeno is one of the best products I have encountered.  </li>
      <li>The results were incredible!  </li>
      <li>After 3 months, I have been very impressed with the results.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR ON THE GO SPOT TREATMENT!</li>
      <li>I take very good care of my skin</li>
      <li>Good for them!  </li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>You can also purchase some great glycolic/lactic peels here on amazon from cellbone.      </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 6 months now with great results.  </li>
      <li>Anything that helps improve self confidence for someone you love is a great investment!</li>
      <li>This is truly a remarkable product.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely fair skin</li>
      <li>My wife and I are very satisfied with our purchase and its results...</li>
      <li>This is a very interesting product that uses heat to denature acne bacteria heat shock proteins.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>And I really liked it for those deeper acne you can feel coming on.</li>
      <li>Sounds like it is a good product that is in fact helping most.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>The treatment cartridge runs out too quick!!</li>
      <li>You can even buy the $33 recharge tip with 90 cycles and still come out better by buying at walgreens....      </li>
      <li>So, I decided to give it a try after making sure the product was returnable (within 30 days)</li>
      <li>This thing is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>This worked ok.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love this.</li>
      <li>Several of my friends tried Zeno (all of them had awesome results).  </li>
      <li>it is going to make it magically disappear.</li>
      <li>In my personal experience, this product is absolutely wonderful.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed it.  </li>
      <li>So you will still see the pimple, but it clears in a day or a couple of days rather than many days.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Much better price.  </li>
      <li>My skin has never looked better since our family dermatologist recommended Zeno.</li>
      <li>You have to have these peels done at a spa and the price is typically high ($200-300) but the outcome is great.  </li>
      <li>But if that&#x27;s not an issue for you then this device is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Yes, the tip on the $149 version from walgreens is only good for 50 cycles, but you can buy the replacement tip good or 60 cycles for $25 from walgreens.  </li>
      <li>I used to treat it with hot, moist compresses which took days to be effective.  </li>
      <li>Eventually, the light does turn on; it just takes longer than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money in my opinion!  </li>
      <li>Well, he was right on the money!</li>
      <li>i.e. the tip was a full 90 day cycle tip.</li>
      <li>they just required more treatments (makes sense to me, since they are deeper than normal ones).  </li>
      <li>Be aware that the walgreens tip is only good for 50 treatments.  </li>
      <li>Has eliminated this kind of acne for me and often seems to even diminish / shorten white heads, though the manufacturer says it&#x27;s not suppose to.  </li>
      <li>The more expensive version is good for 90 treatments which makes it a better deal.</li>
      <li>but it definately IS worth purchasing.  </li>
      <li>and they are right</li>
      <li>The Zeno clears them up in a day or two if I catch them right away.</li>
      <li>I am so happy that a product is finally out there for pimples that does not dry out my skin...</li>
      <li>it is well worth the price, and it really works!</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time on a pimple</li>
      <li>That said, I consider the Zeno an important part of my aresenal for clear skin.  </li>
      <li>That seems safer, since the unit does in fact get hot.</li>
      <li>I believe this is because my acne condition is caused mostly by hormones and not necessarily by bacteria on the skin.      </li>
      <li>This means that for people that get more than the occasional breakout, you will be spending a lot of money if you choose to use the Zeno exclusively.  </li>
      <li>The first 2 pimples I used Zeno on reduced in size almost immediately.</li>
      <li>I am going to buy several more now as gifts for family members...</li>
      <li>I basically use it on the pimple (when it first comes up) until the pimple is gone.  </li>
      <li>I have used literally THOUSANDS of \\&quot;acne clearing\\&quot; products and this is the first one I have ever found that works.</li>
      <li>Frequent light to medium grade peels (like the Cosmedix purity peel and timeless peel) have done wonders for my skin condition.  </li>
      <li>I usually have pretty good skin, but when I&#x27;m stressed or \\&quot;once</li>
      <li>I paid a hefty price for it, but what I see so far is that it reduces the cyst type acne quickly.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this unless you have previewed it and are certain it will work for you.</li>
      <li>my skin is clear (for the first time in my life!)</li>
      <li>This product really does work.  </li>
      <li>I get the deep, under the skin kind that you can feel long before you can see it.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend giving it a try, you have 30 days and if it doesn&#x27;t work, you&#x27;ll know much sooner than that</li>
      <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t reccommend it enough, and if you&#x27;re worried about the cost, add up the cost you&#x27;ve spent on all those products in the medicine cabinet (none of which work) and see how much they&#x27;ve cost over the years.</li>
      <li>Admittedly, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks and hopefully, it will not stop working (this is true of many products once your skin gets used to the product),</li>
      <li>The acne does clear up fast - sometimes one day sometimes two days, but it does work.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, I would normally get some sort of scar that took forever to fade with a cystic pimple, but Zeno cured me of that too.  </li>
      <li>The instructions say to press the first button (that is a circle with a line in it) and wait for the clock light to turn green.  </li>
      <li>Zeno is well worth the initial price and the $35 for replacement tips too.</li>
      <li>I applied Zeno to my newly formed pimples (as the directions indicated...</li>
      <li>you will know because it shows one blue light left to warn you that you have almost used up the tip life...</li>
      <li>In my best friend&#x27;s personal experience, this product did NOTHING to help her deplorable skin situation.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>and I do more than 3 treatments, usually about 4 or 5.  </li>
      <li>one, the one that hadnt fully sufaced is now, GONE, completely!</li>
      <li>I have since been told that Thermaclear is the same concept, is a better product because it doesn&#x27;t require a cartridge change, AND it is faster, in that it is only seconds, rather than 2.5 minutes, which can cause minor burning if you hold it too zealously.  </li>
      <li>As soon as I felt the cystic pimple forming (they feel deep and hurt a little bit), I kept using Zeno on it till it started going away (it was more than 3 treatments, but I know my body...</li>
      <li>I suspect that these are already \\&quot;too far gone\\&quot; for the device to work.</li>
      <li>I have cystic acne and have done Accutane three times (yes, 3 times) as an adult to get rid of it.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised on how well it worked.</li>
      <li>My pimples disappeared completely during the treatment cycle.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is its high cost.  </li>
      <li>It seems like it takes a long time for the device to be ready to use.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine 24 years ago was married to a Doctor and told me of the advantages of zapping high intensity heat into a pimple to destroy the bacteria and make it heal.  </li>
      <li>After the initial $200+ investment, you have to spend 30 dollars every 90 cycles (to get new tips).  </li>
      <li>One major drawback is that every 100 or so &#x27;burns&#x27; you need to replace the cap.</li>
      <li>As near as I can tell, during this time, the tip is heating to the proper temperature.  </li>
      <li>(a) I expected as much and</li>
      <li>It is the only one that works immediately and completely.  </li>
      <li>And the other two witch were about a week old but still hadnt came to a head and still very painfull are now no longer red and have srunk to a 1/4 of the size they were.</li>
      <li>I use the old over-the-counter benzoil peroxide on the minor things, but anything that looks like it&#x27;s going to be major, gets the zeno treatment.</li>
      <li>Kinda disappointing to spend this much money and then realize you have to spend so much more if you want to keep using it.</li>
      <li>also, on rare occasion, get regular small whitehead pimples and this product did not seem to work on those.  </li>
      <li>So now, between two units and several cartridges, I have several hundred dollars invested, and not a single working Zeno device.  </li>
      <li>In the morning, following one application of Zeno (the whole thing took less than twenty minutes), they were all gone.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it painful, but it is most &amp;#34;painful&amp;#34; (referring to what others have commented on) when it&#x27;s really working, so perhaps this is why it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have two of these, one of which is for travel.  Same model.  They seemed to work well for a bit.  Then, both of them stopped working.  Lights lit, etc, but upon turning them on, they don&#x27;t heat up anymore and automatically shut off.  I have spare cartridges, which are quite expensive and not returnable,  so I purchased yet a THIRD unit.  You know what?  Right out of the box, failure.  Wouldn&#x27;t charge at all, so I returned it.  So now, between two units and several cartridges, I have several hundred dollars invested, and not a single working Zeno device.  I wrote to the manufacturer to see what they could/would do under the circumstances, as their product simply didn&#x27;t hold up.  Nothing but textbook response back, telling me to re-charge the units.  Well I did, for DAYS.  I have since been told that Thermaclear is the same concept, is a better product because it doesn&#x27;t require a cartridge change, AND it is faster, in that it is only seconds, rather than 2.5 minutes, which can cause minor burning if you hold it too zealously.  That seems safer, since the unit does in fact get hot. Plus, when you have oily skin, it is very difficult to hold something against a raised surface for 2.5 minutes and not have it slip. Suffice it to say, I am extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> The first 2 pimples I used Zeno on reduced in size almost immediately. They were the deep cystic variety.  I was ecstatic.  Unfortunately now that I have used the product for a month it seems like the gadget only works on approx. 40-50% of my total pimples.  I believe this is because my acne condition is caused mostly by hormones and not necessarily by bacteria on the skin.      That said, I consider the Zeno an important part of my aresenal for clear skin.  It&#x27;s definately not the miracle cure but it definately IS worth purchasing.  Frequent light to medium grade peels (like the Cosmedix purity peel and timeless peel) have done wonders for my skin condition.  You have to have these peels done at a spa and the price is typically high ($200-300) but the outcome is great.  You can also purchase some great glycolic/lactic peels here on amazon from cellbone.      Good luck!</li>
    <li> I had four different stage pimples on my face when i purchase this product. I have used the zeno on each one twice now....one, the one that hadnt fully sufaced is now, GONE, completely! Another witch had already turned white and came to a head is now 1/2 the size it was and not read at all. Almost gone. And the other two witch were about a week old but still hadnt came to a head and still very painfull are now no longer red and have srunk to a 1/4 of the size they were. It has&#x27;nt even been 24 hours!!! I highly recommend this procduct to anyone who has small problems zits. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR ON THE GO SPOT TREATMENT! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! IM SOLD!</li>
    <li> My daughter has had moderate/severe acne for the last few years - and we have been to the dermatologist seems every few months trying new creams (and yes, even tried Proactive with absolutely NO results).  The last visit they wanted to put her on pills, but then I saw an ad on Amazon for this product and wanted to try it out before going that route.  This thing is fantastic!  The acne does clear up fast - sometimes one day sometimes two days, but it does work.  Using this along with her prescription cream, her face has cleared up dramatically. It&#x27;s the boost her face needed.  Well worth the money in my opinion!  Anything that helps improve self confidence for someone you love is a great investment!</li>
    <li> Works like a dream.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt, put it up to a zit, and after two and a half minutes, the pain (from the zit) is completely gone, and the zit starts to fade.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is its high cost.  After the initial $200+ investment, you have to spend 30 dollars every 90 cycles (to get new tips).  This means that for people that get more than the occasional breakout, you will be spending a lot of money if you choose to use the Zeno exclusively.  I use the old over-the-counter benzoil peroxide on the minor things, but anything that looks like it&#x27;s going to be major, gets the zeno treatment.</li>
    <li> CAUTION - this device is not for cystic acne or serious cases of Acne Vulgaris.  It&#x27;s for the random pimple or zit you get every now and then.  The trick is to catch them when you feel them coming in.  The heat from the device somehow makes the pimple go away in like 24 hours.  I tried it for the first time on a pimple I could feel on my cheek.  I used the device just once for 2.5 minutes as directed and immediately the pain was gone.  The next day there wasn&#x27;t even a bump. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews that talk about how it didn&#x27;t work and they&#x27;ve tried everything even Accutane and Strivectin.  If Accutane didn&#x27;t work for you, don&#x27;t even attempt this device, that&#x27;s not the point.  It also isn&#x27;t going to work on white heads - think about it, you have an infection with dead white blood cells.  Nothing but manually popping it is going to make it magically disappear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - this device is a god send for the random pimple.  Keep it with you in your purse (if you carry one) or at home in the medicine cabinet like I do (I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t carry a purse).  You&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> I have used literally THOUSANDS of \\&quot;acne clearing\\&quot; products and this is the first one I have ever found that works. Admittedly, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks and hopefully, it will not stop working (this is true of many products once your skin gets used to the product), but until then, I have seen pimples disappear before my eyes. Honestly, I can&#x27;t reccommend it enough, and if you&#x27;re worried about the cost, add up the cost you&#x27;ve spent on all those products in the medicine cabinet (none of which work) and see how much they&#x27;ve cost over the years. That&#x27;s what I did and gave it a shot. I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> I was a little weary on buying this product, because it is a little pricey. I also wondered if it did work that well. I was pleasantly surprised on how well it worked. The only downfall is if you have a lot of acne you have to spend 2  minutes on every spot. This also means that you go through a lot of refills.</li>
    <li> Yes, the tip on the $149 version from walgreens is only good for 50 cycles, but you can buy the replacement tip good or 60 cycles for $25 from walgreens.  That&#x27;s still less than the $199 version with 90 cycles.  You can even buy the $33 recharge tip with 90 cycles and still come out better by buying at walgreens....      Update 10/1 - I ordered and received the zeno from walgreens and it came with the 90 day tip even though the product description on the walgreen site indicated 50.  And no, the tip didn&#x27;t come with half remaining i.e. the tip was a full 90 day cycle tip.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my pimple go away over night. It might reduce some healing time. The treatment cartridge runs out too quick!! You think 60 count is a lot but it&#x27;s really not. I bought another one for my friend as a gift. It didn&#x27;t even wanna turn on. I had to send it back. I called the number on the box. Their customer service sucks, they never picked up the phone or return my phone call ever. I had to send it back to amazon.</li>
    <li> Several of my friends tried Zeno (all of them had awesome results).  So, I decided to give it a try after making sure the product was returnable (within 30 days) if I did not like it.  This is truly a remarkable product.  I applied Zeno to my newly formed pimples (as the directions indicated...three 2.5 minute treatments within 24 hours).  The results were incredible!  My pimples disappeared completely during the treatment cycle.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I even had a cystic pimple that I tried it on...however, I experimented a little bit.  As soon as I felt the cystic pimple forming (they feel deep and hurt a little bit), I kept using Zeno on it till it started going away (it was more than 3 treatments, but I know my body...Zeno was definitely making the cystic pimple smaller with each treatment, so I just kept using Zeno until it was gone).  In my experience, it did work on cystic pimples...they just required more treatments (makes sense to me, since they are deeper than normal ones).  Anyways, I would normally get some sort of scar that took forever to fade with a cystic pimple, but Zeno cured me of that too.  I am so grateful!  You just need to be \\&quot;in tune\\&quot; with your body!</li>
    <li> This is a very interesting product that uses heat to denature acne bacteria heat shock proteins.But it seems to work only on acne that is just starting. Does not seem to work on cystic and conflent acne areas. One major drawback is that every 100 or so &#x27;burns&#x27; you need to replace the cap.</li>
    <li> Wow!  My skin has never looked better since our family dermatologist recommended Zeno. Of course I was skeptical at first, until my doctor told us that Zeno had a 30 day return policy (which we verified on the product website at [...] My doctor also said he had never had a patient return a Zeno. Well, he was right on the money! My wife and I are very satisfied with our purchase and its results...my skin is clear (for the first time in my life!) and she no longer complains about the monthly cyclical pimples. I am going to buy several more now as gifts for family members...it is well worth the price, and it really works!</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne and have done Accutane three times (yes, 3 times) as an adult to get rid of it.  Accutane helped but I still get about 1 cyst a month.  I&#x27;d read that Zeno did not work on cystic acne but decided to give it a try (but kept the receipt, in case it did not work).  After 3 months, I have been very impressed with the results.  I&#x27;ve used it three times where I could feel an acne cyst beginning (where I have a small painful lump under the skin).  I used it morning and evening for three days and the cyst never emerged.  I have extremely fair skin so my skin did show some reddening around the treatment area but (a) I expected as much and (b) it was easily covered by a little makeup and (c) it kept the painful cyst from emerging.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A couple of items to note (since expectations are key):   &lt;br /&gt;(1) It seems like it takes a long time for the device to be ready to use. The instructions say to press the first button (that is a circle with a line in it) and wait for the clock light to turn green.  This takes a little while.  As near as I can tell, during this time, the tip is heating to the proper temperature.  I thought it was broken because it takes mine a few minutes.  Eventually, the light does turn on; it just takes longer than I anticipated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(2) The treatment time seems like an eternity, even though its only 2 and a half minutes.  I suspect that (sad as this is) it is the process of doing nothing for that period of time except holding a device to my face.  However, I&#x27;m convinced that the entire treatment period is necessary, despite the fact that it always feels like I&#x27;m just sitting around doing nothing.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also, on rare occasion, get regular small whitehead pimples and this product did not seem to work on those.  However, I suspect that the reason for this is that by the time they emerge on me, they are already small whiteheads, so superficial that I just scrape them off the skin surface with my fingernail.  I suspect that these are already \\&quot;too far gone\\&quot; for the device to work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now with great results.  It has worked on all my pimples from whiteheads to blackheads to deep pimples.  I basically use it on the pimple (when it first comes up) until the pimple is gone.  I have had to replace my tip once during this time (it lasts about 90 uses before it needs to be replaced...you will know because it shows one blue light left to warn you that you have almost used up the tip life...once you use all the tip life, it won&#x27;t start again until you replace the tip).  I am so happy that a product is finally out there for pimples that does not dry out my skin...and it actually works!  Zeno is well worth the initial price and the $35 for replacement tips too.</li>
    <li> I am over 40 and get monthly breakouts.  If I feel like I might be getting a zit, I only have to use Zeno once and it never surfaces.  When I wake up with a zit, I treat it 3 to 4 times and it is gone the next day! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried it on a cyst but it did not work.  That&#x27;s no surprise.  The manual says it does not work on Cystic and they are right</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I have to admit this product does work.  I paid a hefty price for it, but what I see so far is that it reduces the cyst type acne quickly.  Either the pimple doesn&#x27;t come to a head at all or it rapidly comes to a head and clears.  So you will still see the pimple, but it clears in a day or a couple of days rather than many days. I have already had to replace one cartridge; I&#x27;ve tried it on different types of pimples and I use it religiously like the product says to.  It helps the whitehead type pimples move out faster too.  The cartridge is expensive, but I&#x27;ve found someone that can reset the cartridge for me.</li>
    <li> I have been treated for acne for twenty years.  I have gone through two accutane treatments (six months or so each) and have used oral and topical antibiotics as well as Retin-A and Tazorac for the last twenty years.  Although all of the products have helped, Zeno is one of the best products I have encountered.  It is the only one that works immediately and completely.  Acne sufferers everywhere should buy Zeno immediately.  Zeno should also be purchased by any person who has an upcoming event (wedding, performance, trial, etc.) where they cannot have pimple: I had a six-pimple break-out last week that included cystic pimples and whiteheads (which your product disclaims the ability to fix).  In the morning, following one application of Zeno (the whole thing took less than twenty minutes), they were all gone.</li>
    <li> This product really does work.  I enjoyed it.  But it stopped working altogether after a few months. A bit expensive for such a short time.</li>
    <li> FYI - Walgreen&#x27;s Drugs sells for $149 and the replacement tips for $25.  Much better price.  Just purchased yesterday and can&#x27;t wait to try.  A friend of mine 24 years ago was married to a Doctor and told me of the advantages of zapping high intensity heat into a pimple to destroy the bacteria and make it heal.  Apparently, it has taken this long for someone to actually put it all together and market it.  Good for them!  Sounds like it is a good product that is in fact helping most.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this at walgreens with the intention that if it didn&#x27;t work I&#x27;d return it.  I take very good care of my skin but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t matter and a pimple or several will show up.  Well it actually works, I guess it does depend on each person&#x27;s skin type, but on me it worked.  I usually have pretty good skin, but when I&#x27;m stressed or \\&quot;once a month\\&quot; I&#x27;ll get a deep pimple or two on my chin.  I use it as soon as I start to feel the pimple and I do more than 3 treatments, usually about 4 or 5.  I continue using it until I don&#x27;t feel it anymore, in 2 days it usually is gone.  In my opinion this little gadget is a miracle.  I highly recommend giving it a try, you have 30 days and if it doesn&#x27;t work, you&#x27;ll know much sooner than that and you can return it.</li>
    <li> This worked ok. And I really liked it for those deeper acne you can feel coming on. It definitely cut down on the time I had the acne for. Problem is that I didnt realize the replacement cartridges are about half the price of the unit. Kinda disappointing to spend this much money and then realize you have to spend so much more if you want to keep using it. But if that&#x27;s not an issue for you then this device is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I am nearing 40 years and have having problems with my skin lately.  Don&#x27;t know why, but this definitely has worked for cystic type acne that seems to fester for me for weeks, then painfully emerges for another week or two weeks.  Has eliminated this kind of acne for me and often seems to even diminish / shorten white heads, though the manufacturer says it&#x27;s not suppose to.  Spoke to my nutritionist and she says my body is cleansing itself so soon I will no longer &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; the Zeno, but I could cry it works so well!  Thank you!  It&#x27;s the high heat that helps destroy the bacteria.  I don&#x27;t find it painful, but it is most &amp;#34;painful&amp;#34; (referring to what others have commented on) when it&#x27;s really working, so perhaps this is why it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It might be a bit uncomfortable, but not really &amp;#34;painful&amp;#34; or what I consider to be painful.</li>
    <li> Judging from the reviews, I see that people don&#x27;t realize just how different people&#x27;s skin can be. Like any skin product, this can be hit or miss. In my personal experience, this product is absolutely wonderful. In my best friend&#x27;s personal experience, this product did NOTHING to help her deplorable skin situation. My advise is to go to a dermatologist&#x27;s office, make an appointment to the aesthetician, and have her do Zeno tests on you skin. That way, you can determine how well your skin will react to the product. Be informed consumers! Don&#x27;t buy this unless you have previewed it and are certain it will work for you. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just money wasted. A lot of money wasted. I hope this helps you guys!</li>
    <li> Yes, Walgreens sells this cheaper.  Be aware that the walgreens tip is only good for 50 treatments.  The more expensive version is good for 90 treatments which makes it a better deal. I love this product.  I do not get ordinary acne.  I get the deep, under the skin kind that you can feel long before you can see it.  I used to treat it with hot, moist compresses which took days to be effective.  The Zeno clears them up in a day or two if I catch them right away.</li>
