      <li>it&#x27;s the only mouth spray that I&#x27;ve found that lasts for any amount of time &amp; it tastes great!</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste great, but helps to alleviate my dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>Great product for dry mouth and also breath.</li>
      <li>Of course, what works for one will not work for all, but that&#x27;s true for every &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about the taste.</li>
      <li>At the time it was the only product of its&#x27; kind that I could find, along with the Biotene mouthwash, etc.</li>

      <li>Over the past 20 years I&#x27;ve tried several things, nothing has given me relief until I tried Biotin Mouth Spray last fall, so happy to have some relief, you have no idea.</li>
      <li>I like the Biotene products, and am using the gentle Mint spray, for during the day, if I am not certain my breath is fresh.</li>
      <li>Really helps with dry mouth.</li>
      <li>and I could have saved some restless times thanks to dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>Very good mouth spray for dry mouth and the bad breath that goes along with it.</li>

    <li> The only one that works, even a little.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the taste.</li>
    <li> I use this when I wake up in the middle of the night with a dry mouth.  It seems to take quite a bit to keep the mouth moist.</li>
    <li> If I have to use something, this is good.  You can spray it into your mouth anytime, day or night.  Easy.</li>
    <li> I like the Biotene products, and am using the gentle Mint spray, for during the day, if I am not certain my breath is fresh. It really helps a dry mouth feel better.</li>

    <li> It seems to work against dry mouth but the bottles leak. I got the spray to augment my large bottle of Biotene mouth wash so I could have it with me. I wound up with spots on my pants pockets.</li>
    <li> bought for my sister who uses this all the time</li>
    <li> Two separate dental professionals suggested Biotene Mouth Spray.  I&#x27;m a good little patient and generally carry out my doc&#x27;s orders.  I sure wish I had known about Biotene years ago and I could have saved some restless times thanks to dry mouth.  I only wish other simple mouth wash type products worked as well and were as reasonable in cost.  The positive attitude created by the Biotene carries over to so many other of life&#x27;s adventures.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect solution for dry mouth when you&#x27;re on the go.  One spray at a time is all that&#x27;s needed, and it&#x27;s packaged in the perfect size to carry in a purse or backpack.</li>
    <li> Best I have found for my dry mouth problem!  I&#x27;ve tried the others in all forms and this does the trick</li>
    <li> great product and does everything it advertises !</li>
    <li> Great product for dry mouth and also breath.</li>
    <li> Of course, what works for one will not work for all, but that&#x27;s true for every &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;.  We don&#x27;t like that the bottles tend to leak - the mixture is of course very oily.  The seal on the screw top needs to be tightened down VERY hard.</li>
    <li> It works well and quickly though the effects are very short lived</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare it with.  It doesn&#x27;t taste great, but helps to alleviate my dry mouth.  I have had to take medications in the last few years which make my mouth dry.  At the time it was the only product of its&#x27; kind that I could find, along with the Biotene mouthwash, etc., so I have been using it for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Works.  Recommended to others with similar problems.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve tried that has worked for my extremely dry throat. I have had lots of Radioactive Iodine to treat(?) Thyroid Cancer (I now have radiation Poisoning), the RAI left me with an extremely dry throat and mouth. Over the past 20 years I&#x27;ve tried several things, nothing has given me relief until I tried Biotin Mouth Spray last fall, so happy to have some relief, you have no idea.</li>
    <li> Due to his medications my husband has severe dry mouth. He keeps the spray in his pocket at all times, along with the gel.</li>
    <li> A refreshing relief from dry mouth, with just occasional use.</li>
    <li> This product helps my throat stay moist.  I like it</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Helped me a great deal when I was in the Hospital breathing through my mouth.  I continue to use it when I ever I have a dry mouth problem.</li>
    <li> I have Sjogrens and I carry spray everywhere I go.  I buy it in 3 pack.  Anyone with dry mouth with dry mouth issues for any reason would benefit from using this.</li>
    <li> It does work but still has a slight sting and the flavor is not  to my taste. However I am still using it. At night unfortunately it does not stop my dry mouth. Alas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAK</li>
    <li> A+ seller and Item!!!!!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> great product to have handy</li>
    <li> Works well to moisten the dry mouth even if only for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Very good mouth spray for dry mouth and the bad breath that goes along with it. Great price too.</li>
