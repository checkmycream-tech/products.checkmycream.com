<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only perfume I wear. I&#x27;m always receiving compliments.</li>
    <li> Good..like the smell alot. Is a bit thick in consistenCy but nice. Yes I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this scent...sticks with you all day!</li>
    <li> As other sellers have indicated, the scent itself was difficult to detect - it smells more like cooking oil than Egyptian Goddess. I&#x27;ve purchased this scent in the past from a local market that carried it and It used to be much stronger and last for hours. Definitely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume oil fast delivery</li>
    <li> Quick and as promised.  There are fakes out there, but this seems to be the real deal.</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing, stays on for a long time and is so convenient with it&#x27;s size! I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> First bought this product at Whole Foods and fell in love with this scent! It is amazing!</li>
    <li> I know liking or disliking a particular scent is one&#x27;s personal opinion, but I absolutely love the smell of this product! It has an earthy, musky scent that is not too strong, nor weak, and lasts all day. This is definitely my favorite perfume and I have received many compliments for it and have had many people ask me where I got it.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this perfume, but, it doesn&#x27;t stay with me.  Was hoping it had good staying power as other reviewers mentioned;  guess it doesn&#x27;t work as well with my body chemistry.  But, I do love the smell of it and highly recommend it for that reason.</li>
    <li> Not as fragrant as I thought it would be.  Could barely smell the oil on my skin from the beginning of&lt;br /&gt;the day.  As the day wore on, the fragrance was almost nonexistent.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent, but it does not overpower as so many products do.  Very mysterious the way it changes as the day progressess.  I feel as though it changes with my moods.  It doesn&#x27;t hit people in the face as so many scents do, but it is a subtle expression of you.</li>
    <li> This product has gone down hill. It use to be the best, But now it seems watered down and has no scent. I hear the company may have changed hands and formula. Sorry Auric I have to tell the truth. Get your act together when you do send me a free sample I&#x27;d love the old Goddess back really miss her.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast which it earned 2 stars. But the smell of the oil was not the smell its supposed to smell. The fragance was gone it smelled like cooking oil. Very disaapointed. Lately everywhere i buy the egyptian goddess it smells like if had gone bad. I wish wholefoods would sell it again and then smell it before i buy it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent..it&#x27;s soft, warm, romantic and comforting and it lasts all day with just a little bit. My oil is darker than what&#x27;s shown in the picture..more yellow, but it makes me itch where it comes in contact with my skin. Within an hour, my wrists start itching as does the spots on my neck where I put it. Even after washing it off..I itch. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something in the scent itself or if it&#x27;s something in the carrier oil. It could be just that particular batch had something wrong with it. I got it from a little store 5 or 6 years ago, so they could have changed the way they produce it by now, but I&#x27;m still afraid of repurchasing it. If it wasn&#x27;t for that itch factor, this would be my signature perfume..I&#x27;d never wear anything else. Auric Blends also has the spray perfume..so I&#x27;m hoping I could still wear that. It may not be as strong as the oil, but at least I wouldn&#x27;t itch..I hope! I contacted Auric Blends directly to ask what oils were used in the making of it and they said it was a proprietary blend and refused to tell me. I don&#x27;t need to know how much of everything..but shouldn&#x27;t they at least tell people what&#x27;s used so they can avoid allergic reactions?? That annoyed me. Even in telling them I had an allergic reaction and needed to know what I might be reacting to, they refused to tell me. Not a great way to do business.</li>
    <li> I love this smell, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the black opium though.  I will continue to wear and order more.</li>
    <li> I will never use this Seller again - they refused to work with me when I contacted them about this perfume oil.  The oil has no scent except for a faint cigarette smell. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I had found this sent at a fair, and have to say this was a great price and very quick to come</li>
    <li> This is a great perfume oil that lasts all day without being overwhelming. It&#x27;s got a soft warm scent and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my \\&quot;smell\\&quot; for years. It&#x27;s a comforting smell. It also smells natural, not machine made. I love scented products: candles, lotions, soaps and perfumes, but I find they all have the common machine made smell to them. This oil doesn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been wearing Auric blends oils for 14+ years. Egyptian Goddess is one of my favourite smells.</li>
    <li> Yikes!  Maybe this smells good on others, but it did not appeal to me.  Some reviews stated the scent was not strong enough but again, I did not find this to be the case.  This scent is plenty strong!  I do, however, have to praise Tom&#x27;s Incense on their customer service.  It was exceptional and I got my product in just two days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been so excited to get this scent as I love essential oils and earthy fragrances, but I am really disapointed!  I can&#x27;t really explain how it smells but I find it annoying like a Glade air freshioner.  Oh well, I&#x27;m not out much money and nothing ventured, nothing gained!</li>
    <li> Came fast. Smells pretty. 4/5 because of a package delivery error.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the price.  This oil is not easy to find, so I&#x27;m happy to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed!! I lost the first bottle I ordered that seemed ok, but not what I was used to buying previously at Whole Foods. The second bottle has no scent at all. Is this really Auric blends or just a label. Someone slacked off and we&#x27;re being sold God knows what. I loved the original. We should get a refund😢😢</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is not the same as it used to be. No scent at all, seems like it&#x27;s just oil.</li>
    <li> Auric Blends makes a superior Egyptian Goddess perfume oil.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product so much, I ordered two bottles this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite reports of it being diluted or watered down, I could find no evidence of this&lt;br /&gt;myself.  It is every bit as pleasing and long lasted as the same product I ordered a few&lt;br /&gt;years back.  The price is right and Auric Blends version is one of the best scents in the E musk&lt;br /&gt;category out there. Repeat customer also.</li>
    <li> I love this scent/oil I&#x27;ve been using it for a very long time, and it&#x27;s nice to have a company that will ship it to you within days at a great price!</li>
    <li> It arrived a head of schedule... I love it</li>
    <li> Just rec&#x27;d Egyptian Goddess Perfume Oil &amp; it seems diluted - not like it used to be.  Have worn this for years but the scent is different now.  Pls go back to original scent (very sexy &amp; long lasting) WAS a winner. New formula&lt;br /&gt;is less alluring &amp; weaker - BRING BACK THE GOOD STUFF, PLS.</li>
    <li> It smells absolutely wonderful, just as I remember. However, the scent only lasted about 15 minutes. Very, very disappointed. I used to get this perfume oil from my local flea market, and adored it bc it smelled so great and it lasted all day.</li>
    <li> I love Egyptian goddess but, I thought that finding a good deal would be the same stuff.  Boy, was I wrong!  Very little fragrance and very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Water down not a good buy</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, but will be putting it in a gift package and won&#x27;t be using it for myself this time.</li>
    <li> Great customer service but this blend smells like  very cheap bathroom cleaner</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product got such great review! It doesn&#x27;t have a scent.....what&#x27;s going on?! Do Not Purchase this product, you will be extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the scent is just so soft n beautiful. I have got so many compliments on it. I&#x27;m gonna order more 😊</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this sent for um 20 years and I always get complament on this it is a very clean smell..</li>
    <li> I have used Bonne Bell Musk Oil for years. Apparently it is no longer made in its original formula. Someone recommended Egyptian Goddess as a good replacement. It is similar but NOT the same. It also does not have much staying power.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance but I have to use very sparingly as it causes a slight rash sometimes.  Whether I use alone or blended in lotions or creams.</li>
    <li> Took a chance by the description listed on the product, received and loved it from the moment I opened the cap. If you&#x27;re looking for a sexy scent- this is it! Soft with musk properties. Lots of compliments on this one, ladies!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS FOR YEARS AND LOVE IT, BUT CAN NO LONGER FIND IT IN STORES IN MY AREA. YOUR COMPANY MADE IT VERY EASY TO ORDER FROM. I ACTUALLY ORDERED THIS ONE AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE. SHE LOVES IT NOW ALSO</li>
    <li> Price was right and the majority of reviews seemed promising, but I wanted something you can actually smell :(... Barely any fragrance and people actually asked why I stopped using perfume :( They thought I developed allergies or asthma... I don&#x27;t need to spend ANY money to put a little baby oil on my wrists.</li>
    <li> When I opened it the fragrance was amazing I used it but the smell of the oil did not last as I thought it would and now every time I open it theres really no fragrance just the oil. The reason I purchased it was because I smelled it on someone else and it smelled so good she gave me the name so I right away came on here to buy it.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent my husband loves this fragrance on me. its so soft and stays on all day, even when i cant smell it i get compliments.....(:</li>
    <li> Love it- I get tons of compliments on the subtle, myserious scent I am wearing. Very unique, lighter than my usual patchoulie, may be my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Been using this 20 years now, addicted to natural oil perfumes.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this scent for, um, about 15 or more years now.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed.  I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian goddess for years but the two bottles I just bought have no scent!  The scent used to last all day.  This smells like some kind of chemical, not the Egyptian goddess that I know.  I will not buy it again!</li>
    <li> Barely any scent at all.....compared to a bottle of the scent my friend purchased a year ago.  She was the reason I purchased.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice fragrance, really like it. As with other Auric Blends perfume oils though, you only need VERY little. I got Rasta for my husband at Whole Foods... Nice but only if you use very little!</li>
    <li> actually stopped a women in a grocery store to ask what scent she was wearing.  took me quite a while to track it down.  glad amazon provided a source.  just a drop goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is musky and exotic, and the scent changes over the course of the day you as you wear it. a little goes a long way, but it is quite captivating, I would have to say it is a favorite of mine. I am sure it would smell different on everyone, but I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not liking it. Used correctly, it tends not to be too heady, and definitely lingers well as you walk by. Lasts the whole day too. I recommend.</li>
    <li> My signature scent.  It&#x27;s a beautiful scent that is not overpowering (I am sensitive to strong smells) and the roller application is perfect.  LOVE!!</li>
    <li> From the reviews, I was hoping to find a auric blend that is feminine, floral with some musk, sandalwood, SOMETHING!!  But, little to no scent, much more carrier oil, probably almond oil, but very little scent.  I&#x27;ve never returned anything to amazon but I&#x27;m looking at how much it will cost me to box and return.</li>
    <li> I have been finding that  the scent is not as potent as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I feel like I am just rubbing oil on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know if they are adding less fragrance but it is noticable.&lt;br /&gt;might stop buying it.</li>
    <li> Smells like the store bought version but the two bottles I purchased were weaker in scent that the retail version. I Iove this fragrance, but this actual product was too weak even though the same labels. You can&#x27;t put enough on to smell good.</li>
    <li> This is not as I remember it. There is a strange chemical smell...almost like plastic or play doh. I usually wear Egyptian musk, by kuumba made, and get compliments all the time.  Kuumba made makes a warm, inviting Egyptian musk that lasts into the next day.  I&#x27;m so disappointed in auric blends, this and love were my all time favorites...until now. Like others have said, I think they changed the formula.  I was wearing Egyptian goddess today at work and someone told me I smell like play doh and potpourri....not good.  I really hope that auric blends hears what their customers are saying and goes back to the old formula. I&#x27;m so sad. :(</li>
    <li> I first day I wore this I was receiving compliments. It&#x27;s is a light musk with a note of floral.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle of this perfume, it smells very clean and is easy to apply with the roll on feature.  It isn&#x27;t an overpowering scent and people usually comment on how good it smells.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and have been ordering it for over a year. I will continue to order such a great&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE.  SCENT LEFT WITHIN SECONDS OF PUTTING IT ON. VERY DISAPPOINTED .</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter.  Smells really nice.  Quick service as well.  Would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> mostly oil.  Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This is very strange, but the first time I used this, there was a faint pleasant smell,  and now there is no scent at all! I don&#x27;t know if the oils are not mixing or what.  I have rolled a decent amount onto a sheet of paper and had other people at work do a scent test, and they said the same thing, they smell nothing!  I did receive my order super fast, so that&#x27;s good.  I also ordered Black Opium, and ironically that scent lingered even after showering.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t really care for that scent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Egyptian Goddess, and have never had any problems. This time around, I was pretty disappointed when I rolled on a faint oil upon my wrist. I understand that perhaps I received a sort-of defective one. I will continue to buy Egyptian Goddess, but was pretty bummed that I received an roll-on oil minus the scent of an Egyptian Goddess</li>
    <li> Whoa this stuff is magical!! Just received this in the mail &amp; omg the Egyptian Goddess is just magical!!!! Crisp, fresh but has this mysterious warmth to it k a soft dry down with a tiny scent of clean flowers...like a tulip or maybe a heliotrope...yummy can&#x27;t wait to bring thisin our tropical vaca next week, perfect!</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this - which is often - I get many compliments. I actually had a guy I was sitting next to at a stoplight (on my motorcycle) who told me I smelled really fantastic.  Well worth the price, I always get two or three at once.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. You only need a small amount &amp; it lasts for a while. Good price.</li>
    <li> Product is easy accessable-a roll on. I love the scent of Egyptian Goddess Auric Blends Pefume Oil, I will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used Egyptian goddess -auric blends perfume oil for many years. I just purchased two more bottles.  Delivery was quick and I do appreciate that, but ....I have to say the scent was not at all the same.  Actually there was barely a hint of any scent at all!  Needless to say, I am quite disappointed this time around.</li>
    <li> love, love, love this scent.</li>
    <li> Great, light nidy oil!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have to agree with many of the reviewers - there is no lasting fragrance.  When my wife first opened the bottle, there was a lovely musk but after applying, there is no fragrance.  It&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t make this with more of the perfume and less plain oil.  I would have paid more for quality perfume oil with lasting power because the initial fragrance was lovely.</li>
    <li> I love love love this brand of perfume oil. It&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve found. This scent is very sexy, smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this oil ,was introduced to  it by a coworker and was very happy to find that I could purchase at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Such a great aroma with no chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love the scent! Always get compliments!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for over 10 years. It does smell different on everyone. It is the perfect musk for a woman. Earthly smell with a tad bit of sweetness.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. On top of that, it is very reasonably priced. I get compliments on this ALL THE TIME. If this isn&#x27;t your scent, try another of their line and find the one that smells good on you. It wears all day without being overpowering. It will linger faintly on everything, though, so make sure you really like it.</li>
    <li> I love this smell its not too strong and the musk smell is amazing. I would definitely recommend this if you love musks.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best auric blend.</li>
    <li> This is something of a classic Eqyptian Musk scent. I was looking for an oil that is pretty close to some other Egyptian Musk oils that I like and this one is a good fit. Shipping was fine also. No problems.</li>
    <li> I love this scent...it&#x27;s not too strong like patchouli can be yet still has that musky scent. Not floral or spicy. .</li>
    <li> This oil is very long lasting!  I call smell it from the moment I leave work to dinner later that night.  I think it&#x27;s a nice light &amp; clean smell that is gentle and calming.  I was hoping it would be a bit more spicy and alluring, I will try something else next.  Great quality.</li>
