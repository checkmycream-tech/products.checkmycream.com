<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Thai stuff stinks and it&#x27;s impossible to blend in, also faded off extremely patchy.</li>
    <li> good color my daughters love the shade they get</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work so well for me. The pros were that it was easy to apply, went on without streaking (using a tanning mit) and dried quickly. The cons - it washed straight off in the shower the next day with no scrubbing or soap etc. I would still use it occasionally as a temporary fix - I can put it on very quickly to get a bit of color before a night out or something and its OK for that. I have used many self tanners in the past but unfortunately this one doesn&#x27;t last on me.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. The tint is very useful as to apply it evenly and the afterwards colour is beautiful. The seller was really nice and helpful. It is a purchase I would recommend.</li>
    <li> wish it lasted longer but the color is awesome!!</li>
    <li> This product was by far disappointing. What I do like about it though is that it has great color, but what I hate is that it is horrible to blend, or make it look even. I have the St Moriz tanning application mit, and I&#x27;ve even tried using my hands, which is horrid considering the fact it looks like a stain on your skin almost immediately and it&#x27;s so dark, neither of which blended good. It looks fake on my legs, and it was just dissapointing :/ I continue to use it occasionally on my stomach/back and use other-better tanning product on my legs, but I would not but this product again</li>
    <li> I bought this after hearing such great reviews and after I was finished paying for it I got an e-mail saying that it would take 2-3 1/2 months to be shipped to my house. I was really let down but when I came home today it was waiting for me, it took about a week and a half (which isn&#x27;t bad at all). I know some people said the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t as strong at St. Tropez (which I love!!!) but i can honestly say when I applied it I didn&#x27;t smell anything. Most if not almost all the color washes off after you shower (same with St. Tropez) but it left a faint bronze look. I don&#x27;t adore it yet but I don&#x27;t dislike it either, I&#x27;ll have to use it more than once to know if I love it or not :)</li>
    <li> I love the way tan skin looks, but if I go out in the sun or use tanning beds, I get freckles galore. Because of that, as well as my desire to not get skin cancer, I&#x27;ve been constantly looking for the right self tanning product for me. I think I&#x27;ve finally found it with St. Moriz - but it does take a bit of practice to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use disposable vinyl gloves to apply the tanner. They come in large, fairly priced boxes, and they completely erase any fear of the dreaded \\&quot;orange palms\\&quot; that are a dead giveaway of self tanning. If I want a super-even glow, I use a sponge round to apply the tanner in long strokes. If I&#x27;m looking for a super-dark tan, I just spread it on. I do look a bit like I rolled in dirt after I apply it, because of the bronze guide, so I always use it at night, and then shower in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing off the bronze guide (which does help to avoid streaks while you&#x27;re applying the product), my skin looks awesome! The tan is brown, not orange, so it looks natural, and I don&#x27;t have issues with streaks. However, if I&#x27;m not careful, my knees will turn brown from the product, which doesn&#x27;t exactly look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this product. People ask me if I&#x27;ve gone tanning whenever I use it. That&#x27;s great to hear, because I love looking tan, and now I can do it without sacrificing my skin&#x27;s health!</li>
    <li> Cheapest price I have seen. Excellent product as u can see where u have placed the tanning foam. Looks great not orange. Received in less than a week!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy. I will order again.</li>
    <li> The only negative about this self-tanner - it washes off fairly easily when bathing.  Love the color though.  My husband says it is the most natural looking of any of the tanners I&#x27;ve used.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> I like it but it washes off pretty easy so reapplying after showering is always needed but the mouse form makes is easy</li>
    <li> The product arrived in about 12 days after I ordered it. Unfortunately the product leaked (quite a bit) in the package, so when I opened it there was tanner everywhere, all over the packaging material, the bottle and my hands. However, I love the tan I receive when I used it. I actually combined the dark St. Moriz with the medium. After exfoliating and moisturizing my hands, feet, knees and elbows, I applied the dark to my body and the medium to my hands, and my feet. I combined the two because the dark always leaves my hands and feet too dark but the medium isn&#x27;t dark enough for my body. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it, but the first day after tanning, I tend to have an orange tinge that goes away after the second wash. I have been a self-tanner for years so I have come to deal with the slight orange color that follows a nice self-tanning. I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry, no suntanning here. I will definitely be ordering both the medium and dark again.</li>
    <li> Great color on my very fair pale skin! Doesn&#x27;t streak easily, and I honestly like the smell. The mitt makes it much easier to put on.</li>
    <li> It covered well, was absorbant and left a very even-looking tan.  Also it did not rub off on my clothes or sheets  It was also creamy, not oily</li>
    <li> I am a brand name woman when it comes to makeup and body care... So I was really skeptical trying something other than St Tropez. I am still shocked that I actually like this product much more! The color is a more natural, sun-kissed look rather than the bronzey-gold every other self tanner out there gives you. It goes on smoothly and leaves way less of a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; look than other tanners... Pretty great if you want to have it on all day or under your make-up. The smell is a bit off-putting at first, but I actually prefer it over the ridiculously strong scent I put up with using St Tropez. I definitely recommend this product! It&#x27;s not very often a quality product like this is priced so fairly!</li>
    <li> It goes on easily with a mitt &amp; gives instant results.It is alittle messy,that&#x27;s why I do it at night so I can shower off excess in the morning.</li>
    <li> I was super excited about ordering this because I have been looking for an affordable self-tanner.&lt;br /&gt;The good: It is applied evenly since you can see exactly what you&#x27;re doing. It does not have a really bad smell. I can smell it a little if I have been working out but for the most part I don&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: It barely gave me any color. It took me from a ghostly white to a pale. I am going to continue to use it to see if my color will build but if I order again I will probably order it in dark even though I am very light skinned.</li>
    <li> Great product definitively purchasing from here again!</li>
    <li> this stuff is the best self tanner out there it dosn&#x27;t smell n it goes on so smooth with a mitt i just love it n the color you get with this is awesome brown not orange ...get it an enjoy your faux tan   .........</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for products (actually, this is the first time I ever have), but my love for this tanner has motivated me to share my experience with others.  I have used tons of self tanners -- Loreal Sublime and Xen Tan were my favorites until I tried this.  I exfoliate thoroughly before applying and then I moisturize each night after showering to lock in the color. The color is completely believable and turns my casper-white skin to a golden tan! The guide color is great, as you can see exactly where you&#x27;re applying, but it is darker than what you will have when you shower it off the next morning.  It will stain your clothes and sheets though(left my white sheets pink!), but it will wash off.  My only problem with the tanner is that it dries really quickly -- you have to be very fast in your application if you want it to be seamless.  I have never had streaks from this product, and for the price -- you can&#x27;t beat the color.  I use the St Tropez tanning mit to apply -- this keeps my palms clean and I never have to worry about orange hands! I exfoliate twice a week, and that takes off the majority of my tan, so I can&#x27;t say exactly how long the tan would last if you didn&#x27;t do this. It&#x27;s buildable, and if you apply it every night for a few nights, you are going to get pretty dark. The smell is pleasant at first, but it does get a tad bit strange as it develops -- but there is no noticeable smell after you shower the next morning and wash the guide off.  I hope that I am never without this tanner - I no longer go to the tanning bed now that I know I don&#x27;t have to damage my skin to get a lovely, golden tan.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. As a regular self-tanner, I would have to say this is one of my favorites along with Tanwise. The color is great, not orange at all. In fact, I would say it almost has a greenish base, but does not look green on the skin. My only complaint is that it fades quickly and when it does, the color is a little uneven. This is definitely worth trying, though.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange. I wish it would last a little bit longer.  I will reorder this product.  I use it on my face and all over my body.  It is wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a self-tan connoisseur! I have strawberry blonde hair and naturally fair skin. Though I enjoy my natural ginger qualities, I also appreciate a sun-kissed look on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This self-tanner is in direct competition with St. Tropez, yet this is a budget friendly option that is sure to give the same great results with out breaking the bank!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam is easy to apply and dries quickly. The product leaves an immediate tint, but should be showered off after 6-8 hours to get the polished tint desired. (Before showering, skin appears a bit muddy....product must be showered off after wait time).&lt;br /&gt;This tanner also offers a buildable bronze when used consecutively over a day or two. Just reapply until you&#x27;ve reached a desirable shade of tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have great coverage and a natural looking tan after one application. I have never experienced an orange or unnatural tan from using St. Moriz. Typically, I&#x27;ll apply after a good scrub down in the shower the night before an event...I&#x27;ll sleep with the product on 6+ hours and upon waking....I&#x27;ll discover my pasty, pale freckled skin had been transformed leaving me looking as if I traveled to the beach in a nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not as awful as most products containing the ingredients needed in self-tanners (basically it&#x27;s a given...the smell is only a minor set back for the reward of a healthy glow without cancer causing UV rays!). However, it does not linger on the skin after the product is showered off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product last a long time, too. One bottle lasts for multiple use! If applied once a week, you&#x27;ll make it last for 2+ months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save time for shipping as I am fairly certain this is only available overseas. My order was delivered in a reasonable amount of time and....shipped free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to lose here, people. Give this a go!</li>
    <li> The color is natural, but it soaks into your pores pretty bad, making my legs looked like a spotted leopard. I exfoliated till my skin was red (I do this when I spray tan. I use st. Ives apricot scrub) but it still soaked into my pores. Looks good in pictures, but not in person</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it on the areas that don&#x27;t get any sun and after only 4 uses I almost have an even skin tone all over. Just be sure to thoroughly rub it in or else you will notice streaks. It gives you a brown tone rather than an orange tone.</li>
    <li> streaked me up something awful</li>
    <li> I love this self-tanner! It goes on light, airy and tinted, which I LOVE. So many other brands do not have the tint (guide) and it is extremely hard to get a realistic and even-looking tan without it. It dries super fast and isn&#x27;t sticky/tacky in the least. If I could give it more stars, I would! Also love the company in which I bought it from -- great customer service and communication! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on amazon via Blush Cosmetics on May 1 and it came on May 17...way before the estimated ship date YAY!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because others compared it to St. Tropez, which I really didn&#x27;t want to fork out $40 for.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I tried it this morning. It is a great mousse, nicely tinted with a milk chocolate brown color.  I was kinda nervous when I started to spread it on my legs because it did look kinda streaky. But I rubbed it in good and loved the nice tanned look I got right away on my pasty white skin. Then I applied it everywhere else.  I should note I got the medium color and it&#x27;s plenty dark for me. It looks as dark as the VersaSpa dark tan color I got at Suntan City. It&#x27;s been a few hours and I am definitely not the same color I was this morning which is exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Just a note of caution, when you put it on your face, put a good moisturizer on first and then use 1/2 a pump of mousse or less. For some dumb reason I used a whole pump and it was way too much, I kinda botched my face up with too much tanner. But now I know for next time. I am excited to use this product all through winter to keep a nice sunny glow.&lt;br /&gt;Since I can&#x27;t reach my back I can see on my sides where I stopped and it looks crazy. I need my husband to get my back for me because there is a noticeable difference in color. But now I can compare what my skin looks like with and without. The tanned part is a deep chocolatey color and not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very happy customer! Thanks St. Moriz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Updated August 18****&lt;br /&gt;Still a huge fan!  I bought the tanning mitt and that made all the difference when applying to all over your body. I suggest getting the mitt too :)</li>
    <li> My daughter is a teen with bright white skin.  She can&#x27;t tan and we don&#x27;t want to indulge in skin-cancer behavior. So instead of being self-conscious, she did her research and found this product. We&#x27;ve tried all kinds of other products and all turned her orange or streaked or were just plain yucky. This one is different. It&#x27;s a foam that spreads easily and evenly.  We&#x27;ve now ordered it several times from Amazon and are very happy.  Highly recommend it to anyone.  only down side is that it comes from the UK so it takes several weeks to get here.  So buy several so you don&#x27;t get stuck without it.</li>
    <li> This product goes on beautifully and achieves a wonderful olive tone. However, it doesn&#x27;t wear very well. If you get a drop of water on the skin where it&#x27;s applied--even hours after application--it&#x27;s definitely noticeable. Kind of embarrassing. Showering after 12 hours of application rinses off much of the color. With consistent use my skin will get darker, but will fade with patchiness. That seems to be a trademark of tanning mousses, which is why I prefer lotions. I won&#x27;t purchase this again, but if you like mousses, I think it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> I tried several self tanners over the years. This one has plenty of tint to see where you missed a spot or have a streak. I&#x27;m talking super tint making you look a little freaky but the outcome has been great and long lasting (good week). I recommend gloves and application mitt. Considering the price this is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> This self tanner was the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried! It was bronze and never orange and gave you enough color for 7 days. I tan all the time and this product helped me to space it out. Love love! Never using another store bought tanner again.</li>
    <li> Gives you a beautiful bronzed glow. not orange or dirty looking. You do have to use a tanning mit to prevent streaking but other than that it&#x27;s very easy to apply. My only complaint is that it does not last as long as other tanning mouses/sprays. This lasts on my skin for only about 4 days (only showering every other day and not exfoliating or shaving).</li>
    <li> St. Moriz was recommended to me by a friend last year and after going through 2 bottles of it, I needed more.  I am always pleased with the results when I use this.  It is very forgiving in terms of streaks, etc and you can see where you&#x27;re applying it which helps immensely.  Just make sure to wear gloves when applying or it will definitely stain your hands.</li>
    <li> Ordered this a few years ago but forgot to review it. It is a great tanning product, gives a gorgeous tan very fast and looks pretty natural. The only reason I have not reordered is because I have found better products. My main concern with this is the smell: upon application it is not too bad and has a soapy smell but many hours later the &#x27;&#x27;fake tan&#x27;&#x27; smell is fairly strong. I did not mind that much, but my husband could not stand it. As a side note, after 1-2 weeks of waiting for my product, I sent a personal message to the seller and he immediatly sent me another bottle, I was very impressed with the service.</li>
    <li> I use this mousse whenever I&#x27;m needing a quick sun-kissed look. I&#x27;ve never liked mousse over lotion until now. It has ultimately NO SMELL. Read the directions and wear gloves or tanning mitt and pretty soon you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;ve been to the bahamas. Also, my tan lasted for about a week with no re-application and showers every day as well as swimming in the ocean and pool. It faded gracefully with no splotches at all.</li>
    <li> it is runny  out of the can and does not spread so you look dirty and stained. it is not wearable unless you want to look like you are covered in soot. did not buy it from this vendor but do not want others to waste their time and money</li>
    <li> I have never tried a mousse self tanner before. I reviewed this product soooo many times before I bought it but its so cheap that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt if it didn&#x27;t work out. Ok so about the product: I didnt expect the bottle to be good sized. READ the instructions on the bottle before you apply even if you &amp;#34;know&amp;#34; what you&#x27;re doing already. (I&#x27;ve tried so many products) I moisturized with my Vitamin E with Argan oil creme I bought from DG but only on my feet, knees and elbows. I used a latex free glove and an old sock over the glove to apply it and started off with my feet first and went up. It will go on kind of dark but let it dry really good before bed. I slept on a towel just incase. I recommend applying some more lotion on your knees and hands after applying. Woke up, took a shower but did not scrub my skin with soap. The color came off but the actual tan stayed on my skin :) I am very happy with this purchase and will def be buying this again!!!! Oh, my tan is NOT orangey and I am an olived toned skin type.</li>
    <li> I have never been one for fake tan, either when i tried to put it on it went streaky, or was too dark for my pale red head skin. On a big occassion I tended to use the Rimmel Sun Shimmer, which was pale enough to suit me but also easy to wash out when it got streaky. One major problem was if it rained, it ran and I live in Ireland so not a good combo.....&lt;br /&gt;My friend recommended this product to me in Pennys (Primark) one day and if I think about it i think it was the price that made me try it . So first attempt - a disaster, streaks every where, then said friend pointed out you need to use the mitt. Second attempt - fantastic!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its a lovely light colour to stop me looking ill/vampire like during the week (with once a week application) and then if there is a night out that i want a bit more, one other application and i feel like a bronzed goddess (prob closer in colour to the average person but still!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product, that is a must have!</li>
    <li> Great product! I love the color, it looks really natural. Only issue was that my hands were stained after I applied the product, make sure to order than application tool!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff, it works amazing. Instant bronzing and turns into a nice tan, although i would wear gloves when applying because it does stain your hands.</li>
    <li> IM IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT!!! Im EXTREMELY pale and this shade makes me look perfectly Sunkissed. I was prepared to wait a month for it to arrive, and it showed up in 6 days. Ive gotten so many compliments on how natural it looks. And for the people that say its streaky, you obviously dont know that you must shower before you can judge the product. EVERY product streaks when applied. Im going to stock up for summer!</li>
    <li> has a weird green tint to it</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  Covers very well and doesn&#x27;t look fake like so many other of these types of products do.</li>
    <li> Apply with gloves!  Good color!  Very easy to apply.  I&#x27;m very pale and the medium tan shade worked just fine!</li>
    <li> This self tanner works well. It has a light consistency because it is a mousse so I recommend using a mitt to apply it. It gets you pretty dark and looks natural. It does have the self-tanner smell that they all have. It really does the job that many more expensive products do for a much better price. I like the shade that it gives you and I like to use this during the times of the year that I don&#x27;t get as much sun to keep a glowing complexion.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with St. Tropez and have found nothing like it until now.  I would say this is comparable to it in every way EXCEPT for the fact that it does not last on your body as long as St. Tropez does.  It goes on exactly the same, looks the same, etc.  It just does not last the way St. Tropez does.</li>
    <li> Great product and I received the item in the U.S. in under a week!</li>
    <li> The color is very believable.  Best to apply outdoors in a natural light to make sure you don&#x27;t miss a spot.  Be sure to wear plastic gloves under the mitt.  It bleeds through the mitt and is difficult to get off palms.  This will be my self tanner for summer of 2014.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, because I wanted a quick-drying foam.  Unfortunately, the temporary bronzer for this product is messy &amp; ugly.  It looks like you spread greenish mud all over your body... so you can&#x27;t go out in public with it on.  It also comes off on clothing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you rinse off the bronzer, the color of the tan is a nice color... but, for me, it&#x27;s just not worth the mess of the bronzer... so I&#x27;m switching back to my previous product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Neutrogena would start selling their bronzerless-foam again.  That was the best product.  It was a quick-drying foam... that was clear.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll be bringing it back.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different self tanners and this really is the best.  It goes on so even (with a mit) and looks very natrual.  No odor is also a big plus.  Lasts several days.</li>
    <li> Worked great, just don&#x27;t put that much. It may not look that dark when you first apply it, but once it sets in it gets darker. It looks like a real tan, no orangeness whatsoever. Use gloves and if you put it on your face, make sure it&#x27;s blended in with your neck too and be careful how much you put bc you will look like you just came out of the tanning bed or that you have a heavy foundation on. I have an olive complexion but am very white from winter. I used it and was tanner than my friends who have been laying out in the sun, but it didn&#x27;t look fake, looked like I had been out in the sun for a month or something. I used the medium, bought the dark also but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need it as medium is perfect for me. Great product for the money. Oh yeah WEAR GLOVES. Dries very fast so it didn&#x27;t get on my clothes at all, put my clothes on maybe 7-10 min after I applied it</li>
    <li> Still my go to, a million times better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  I like the mouse texture because its easier to apply quickly and get the even tone as apposed to thick lotions or sprays.  I use the dark usually and it turns out pretty well.  Exfoliate and apply after a shower, don&#x27;t leave on more that five hours or it will over develop and look slightly weird.  Have only had compliments on this product as apposed to there where people said i looked orangey.  Best of all its the cheapest.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, it goes on very dark, next day wash it off, and it looks good for about a week.  The only thing to remember is if you are going swimming in chlorine it will come right off.</li>
    <li> Application is very easy . As the tan starts to fade, unfortunately it was very uneven and blotchy on my skin.</li>
    <li> Im darker than what I had thought, so I need a darker color. but the smell is good, not that yucky self tanner smell.</li>
    <li> My bottle was spilled in the box and the cap was cracked. Was not pleased with this at all. Product doesn&#x27;t spread well. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> After I read the reviews for this product, I order me a bottle. I&#x27;ve tried just about every self tanner there is and this stuff is by far my favorite! It gives you a tan within seconds. I didn&#x27;t have any streaks, and I love how fast it dries. I prefer a dark tan so the second time I used it I put on two layers of the medium. It makes me look like I&#x27;ve been tanning all year. I ordered the dark after my second use of the medium. I will keep buying this tanner. I highly recommend it! The only con is that it is only sold in the UK, but it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
    <li> First of all wear gloves when applying this! It is the only fake tan anything that has ever made a significant difference on my skin!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use fake tanner because they always look orange and/or streaky, but after seeing my sister in law&#x27;s results with&lt;br /&gt;St Moritz I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to apply, and my legs were a perfect shade of tan! Love it.</li>
    <li> great dupe for St Tropez&lt;br /&gt;make sure you use a mit or gloves, let develop for 4-6 hrs &amp; rinse off with plain water to get rid of any transfer &amp; smell before dressing or workout.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is absolutely amazing. I bought this the day of prom and used it as last resort when my tanning salons spray tan machine broke. I will continue using this as it gave me a very natural tan in a short amount of time. The two pictures I have about three hours between them but the tan showed right after I applied it. I don&#x27;t notice too much of a green color but you can decide for yourself because I didn&#x27;t wash off the guard color in my second picture.</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with how quickly my order arrived! Estimated delivery time was 4-6 weeks and it was in my mailbox just 1 week after it was shipped out! The product itself is very good, a little streaky in some spots, but I believe it&#x27;s just because I put it on quickly before bed and wasn&#x27;t as thorough as I should&#x27;ve been. Still, it gave me a very natural looking tan. I told a friend it was a self tanner and she said she never would&#x27;ve guessed, and that it looked like I had been tanning in a salon! Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this shade out as a winter tan since the dark can look a little fake after a while.  This one is perfect.  It gives me a nice glow and I don&#x27;t look like I am too dark.  It has great staying power too!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I actually got it faster then I thought it would came, and the price is pretty decent and I tried it it was trenmended but it does get on your clothes so next time around I&#x27;ll buy a tanning lotion instead but that was my fault but it don&#x27;t hurt to try new things</li>
    <li> The St. Moriz Instant Self Tanning Mousse is fabulous! Both times I have used it, it looks like Ive been tan and playing in the sun day in and out! On the day I used it, I went to some outdoor events and got nothing but compliments on my tan. Once I let friends know it was a self tanning mousse, they had to have it too! Great buy for such a great product!</li>
    <li> My daughter told me about it but couldn&#x27;t find it at Ulta so went on line &amp; ordered &amp; I&#x27;m so very pleased about the results. The best ever!</li>
    <li> Love it! This stuff works great! I am medium-light skined and I only need one application to get me the right color. It stays for about a week. It leaves a nice bronze color. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> The package arrived stained and when I opened it there was nothing but the plastic cap left in the shipping envelope. Would have been nice to get to at least try it! Not happy.</li>
    <li> First of all, I only bought this because of all the other reviews. I&#x27;m glad I did because I&#x27;m impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin and most tanners simply make me orange so I was glad to see the golden brown color with St. Moritz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I applied it with some plastic gloves in circular motions and it created some areas with more product, which I just kept trying to rub in more as I was worried it would leave a darker streak. I don&#x27;t think plastic gloves were the best applicators and I will try to find a mitt for my next application.&lt;br /&gt;I did wash the product off after only 3 hours (they recommend 4-6hrs) to test how it it would work. I put it on my face and washed that after only 2 because I have sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t want it to be super noticeable in May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle had some great tips and directions and I did my best to clean it when I was finished. The foam is decent and turns into liquid when you&#x27;re spreading it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did not end up with any streaks and the color looked great. (I used the medium color)</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that the mousse tanned immediately,but I didn&#x27;t like that it comes off so quickly.  I really need the dark mousse but didn&#x27;t see an option when I ordered it.  I would like to try the darker and compare.&lt;br /&gt;Kaye Cole</li>
    <li> I ordered this product two years ago and it worked great, and recently I decided to return to it, much to my disappointment. The product from 2 years ago left good enough color for my naturally fair skin, hair, and eyes, but after applying it last night and showering this morning, everything washed off and I&#x27;m as white as ever.&lt;br /&gt;The package had also arrived with some of the product smeared on the outside of the bottle, leaking. I wonder if the leak is the issue...?</li>
    <li> This stuff. THIS STUFF. Let me just begin by saying that I have tried bajillions of self tanners and this is the one. Anyone that does fake bake knows that part of it is exfoliating before hand. With this stuff, it&#x27;s OK if you skip out on the skrub for the day! It doesn&#x27;t flake up on your skin and peel like a lizard. You get out of the shower (I put disposable gloves on) and rub this stuff on like lotion. It doesn&#x27;t have a terrible, over-powering smell like so many other self tanners. It kind of smells like old people.. which isn&#x27;t all that bad. It DOESN&#x27;T STREAK. You can cake this stuff on till&#x27; your tan heart is content and you aren&#x27;t going to look like a streaky oompa-loompa. That&#x27;s another thing, the tan isn&#x27;t orange.. It&#x27;s a brown tan unlike any self tanner that I have tried. Also, this stuff stays on your skin so well. There is no weird transfer onto your clothes or sheets. It dries immediatly after you put it on. I could go on and on about this. The price is outstanding for what this product does. One bottle should last you a good while.. if not, who cares?! It&#x27;s so damn cheap!! It was delivered sooner than the estimated time.. I mean, it&#x27;s perfect. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> the color is very natural , no streaking and fades wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts about 5 days w/o reapplication. Scent is light compared to other self- tanners.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must try.</li>
    <li> Goes on just like St. Tropez tanning mouse!  Prior to the St Moriz tanning mousse the very expensive St Tropez mousse was the only tanner that looked natural that I had found and that did not streak.  I hated paying nearly $50 a bottle but since there were no other options I stuck with it.  I stumbled across this St Moriz and watched some u tube reviews and it seemed like it was too good to be true for the price but I ordered it. It arrived 8 days later and we tried it out and wow does it work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is slightly darker than the St Tropez and it goes on just as easy and is streak free.  I put it on one leg and the St Tropez on the other leg and they both looked great with the Moriz maybe 10% darker.  The color is very natural, no streaks and it has a very pleasant and light smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 5 star product at a 5 star price, LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this. I have been using this product for well over a year, and it is how I maintain a golden glow throughout the year. It is easy to apply, easy to correct if you make a mistake, and looks very natural! I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased this produce because of all of the positive reviews. Yet again I feel burned from good reviews! I bought the medium and dark to have a variety of shades. It is very streaky when it dries which is unlike what people are saying in the reviews. I don&#x27;t think I am misusing the product at all because I have used many self tanners before and this one is a lot more streaky than others. Also, you need to wear gloves or your hands turn instantly orange (even if you wash them immediately after) - this is also unlike many self tanners I have used - so beware if you purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this self-tanner! Good color, looks natural, not streaky. The mouse application is very easy to do. The best part about this tanner is it&#x27;s forgiving. I apply and at night and wash off in the morning and I find that if I have any streaks or spots that I missed it evens out fine once I rinse. For the money you can&#x27;t beat this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well, you do have to be careful with application, can streak. Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Goes on well but it does not last long. Make sure to use a mitt. When you take a shower it washes off and the next day you have to reapply. I probably would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> St. Moriz is amazing! It has such a natrual looking color to it and it lasts for quite some time! I love the fact that its only less than $5.00. Any other store i purchase it at is $13.00 and up! HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I have ever used</li>
    <li> Old products laying around a warehouse somewhere. Looks like dog mess when applying. Its basically iodine mixed with some sorry of soap that makes it foamy. Don&#x27;t buy this stuff. Try the real thing.</li>
    <li> This Self-Tanner is the Best!  I recently purchased this self-tanning mousse and I absolutely love it!  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!  The smell is slight, but tolerable.  The color is very natural looking and lasts for almost a week.  It will be my choice from now on since being told I have basal cell skin cancer on my chest!</li>
    <li> I bought my daughter this tanning mousse for her birthday.  She&#x27;s used all kinds of artificial tanning products, and I encourage it since she is avoiding skin cancer  by not cooking herself in the sun or using tanning beds.  Many of the self-tanning products I&#x27;ve gotten her either smell bad or turn her an unattractive orange color, so we were looking forward to try this product.  She first heard of St. Moriz tanning mousse via a YoutTube video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Moriz tanning mousse turned her skin a nice brown color in just a few hours, and the effects last for days.  The only things we&#x27;ve noticed is that applying alcohol based (spray-on) sunscreen makes the color come off somewhat.  It also quickly stains palms of hands and fingernails, so perhaps using gloves when applying it is smart. It has a pleasant scent and the bottle is large by tanner standards - 200 ml is almost 7 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning - the vendor who sells this product on Amazon is in the UK, and shipping to the USA takes 5 or more weeks. This isn&#x27;t obvious when you place the order so if time is of the essence, order early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 12/11 to add:  I just ordered this product again, to give to my daughter for Christmas.  This time the bottle arrived in two weeks.  Bravo!</li>
    <li> Works well, no horrible self tan smell. Color fades within a day or two, not seven like I had read in a few other reviews. If you don&#x27;t mind reapplying ever other day this product is great!</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great product. It definitely can get too dark around knees, ankles, and elbows if you&#x27;re not careful. So, just moisturize before, and apply less tanner to those areas. Blend well with this product or you will notice streaking! I normally put this product on at night before bed mainly because you have to wait a few hours before showering. This product goes on TOO DARK at first, and smells like maple syrup. However, when you shower, you will notice the surface layer washing off and it&#x27;ll leave you with a natural-looking tan. I love this product, you just have to blend well to make it look natural.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Inexpensive, none of the awful smell self tanners usually have, and it works great! My co-workers have all ordered it after admiring my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this. After I received it, I showered, exfoliated, and used it after drying off. The color was nice. Then I showered in the morning to get the excess off and ALL OF IT came off. Completely. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and every time she gets low, we order more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written  a review before but this stuff deserves one. It goes on so nicely and dires so quickly unlike every other tanning product i&#x27;ve ever used. And the color isnt orange or unnatural! Though I would definitely recommend the mitt for application because its key. Also, If you live in the US make sure you choose a national seller opposed to a UK one because you&#x27;d be waiting weeks for it otherwise!</li>
    <li> This product is a little lighter in color than St Tropez and must be rubbed in quickly. Do not apply a lot of product or it will become gritty, easy to work with however and it does not have a \\&quot;self tanner\\&quot; scent at all, smells clean and dries nicely. Used to buy St Tropez for $30...not anymore, will be buying this for a third of the price!!  Great customer service.</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanner. I&#x27;ve used St Tropez for about a year but decided to try this since it is a lot cheaper.  I have to say that I really can&#x27;t tell a difference between the two brands.  I have very, very pale skin and one application gives me a hint of color but doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I put it on before I go to bed, then shower in the morning.  Some of the product does come off in the shower, but there is still a nice color left on my skin. If I use it a couple nights in a row, the color gets darker and looks like I&#x27;ve been to the beach. The key to this product is to use a foam application mitt. The mitt allows a perfect application with no streaks. This stuff will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t use a mitt.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive knockoff of St.Tropez! Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another self tanner- it&#x27;s the best product ever!! 1 application is all I need to go from SUPER PASTY to a light natural tan.  Must also get the tanning mit- NO streaks, and keeps the cracks on your hand from turning brown!</li>
    <li> This product works great and looked very natural! It is hard for me to find a self-tanner that doesn&#x27;t turn orange.</li>
    <li> Having very light coloured skin I&#x27;m always a little worried when putting fake tan on so I decided not to follow the instructions and leave it on for the 4-6 hours. Instead I leave it for about 1 hour and then jump in the shower, it then completely washes off and looks like I shouldnt have bothered, however, it&#x27;s clearly sunk into the skin as when i wake in the morning I have a light tan. Perfect for my skin type. If you want a darker tan then obviously you should leave it for much longer but this works for me for a bit of colour.&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight fake tan smell but nowhere near as bad as other products and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This tan, as long as it&#x27;s applied correctly, does not have the stereotypical \\&quot;orange\\&quot; look to it.  It lasts for several days and at this price you can afford to keep buying it! I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> loved it, I&#x27;m Twilight kid pale and this made me look tan, not orange which is great!</li>
    <li> Yes this tan mousse is everything the reviews say it is. This is my new tan. I&#x27;m so excited that I can get out of the sun now. Thanks for finding a mousse that isn&#x27;t orange, that blends well and that fades nicely. I bought six and I&#x27;m giving them all out as gifts. Ah oh. I better stock up on more.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all of my friends. Normally tanners make you look slightly orange but this one leave you with a golden tan look. (:</li>
    <li> This came 2 and a half weeks earlier than expected so super fast international shipping. If you apply this with a mitt you will have this best looking color. It goes on brown, no hint or orange anywhere to be seen. Smells like a foaming hand soap which makes sense.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and this is easily the best self tanner ever! Shipped from the UK but gets here quick. The color is even and believable, not orange at all. Also, not as smelly as most other tanners. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this self tanner. Its easy to apply and this was my first self tanner. It doesn&#x27;t smell and no one could tell it was fake. It looked so natural on me. I have used it twice and there is still more than half left. This tanner is awesome and very inexpensive also. I&#x27;ll be using this for as long as it&#x27;s available to buy. I will never have to tan again!</li>
    <li> Love this!! Have tried several other brands including fake bake and this definitely is the best! Easy application, never have streaks! I put on at night before bed and rinse off in the morning. Im pale and this gives me a natural dark looking tan. Last almost a week and fades evenly. Be sure to use a glove and mitt to avoid staining hands. Bottle lasts a long time. Well worth trying!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Just started using this product. Easy to apply. Since I&#x27;m not allowed to be in the sun this is great! Shipment came earlier than expected. USE gloves as others have recommended. And protect knees elbows etc. ( I&#x27;m using Xen-Tan blending balm.) Price vs some others is well worth it thus far. I actually found this brand on a review for Nex tan. Saved lots.</li>
    <li> by far the best tanning mousee ive used. and Ive tried EVERYTHING, including st. tropez tanning mousse and personally I like this product better, and not just because of the price. Everyone thinks im naturally tan :) thanks to this stuff . as long as you exfoliate and moisturize your skin consistently, youre set! but anyone who uses self tanner knows that important rule. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Great coverage, but does take a little longer than the Fake Bake to dry. That being said though love it. no lines, easy application, wonderful color with no orange, last for a couple of days, and covers my stretch marks and imperfections like a dream.</li>
    <li> This stud is amazing! Especially for the price. I like how it comes out brown so you know where you have missed. Ou really need to exfoliate before you use it. I wish this company would come up with an exfoliator.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Good product. Gives a natural looking tan. Must wear gloves when applying or hands&lt;br /&gt;stain purple  color. Great price. Tan last about 3 days.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to find a self tanner that stays on my legs. Others have stayed on the rest of my body perfectly fine but on my legs, they have always ALWAYS come off. I tried the St. Tropez mousse and it did give nice color but it didn&#x27;t last through the shower. This stuff craps all over the St. Tropez one. Not only is the color darker and natural looking, I can sweat, wash my hands, etc. without having to worry about this stuff coming off. And for only $4?!?!?! Yes please. I&#x27;ll take another one.</li>
    <li> Goes on very evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rubs in and does not leave a sticky, greasy, or wet feeling on your skin.  No bad smell...at all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Application is easy and dries quickly. I would definitely recommend this to others. Gives the perfect glow without looking orange.</li>
    <li> The color from this was nice, but it washed right off. I really wish it had lasted better as the price is great!</li>
    <li> this is great - gives a really natural tan colour - no orange!  Doesnt smell. Would definitely recommend and repurchase.</li>
    <li> works great, color is perfect, not orange.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how good this product works! So happy with it. I have never had a tanner work for me ever. I came across reviews for this one on pinterest by chance. All good reviews. So i googled the product and came to amazon. The price is super cheap. Great product! So impressed.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! I love it so much!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan but I like having a little more color in my skin especially in the summer. But because I&#x27;m so fair skinned and burn within 15 mins in direct sunlight, I can&#x27;t tan.  I used to use some gradual tanner from Jergens which smells awful and leaves streaks because I can&#x27;t see where I&#x27;ve already put the product. This has a color guard to tell me where I&#x27;ve placed it. Color shows immediately but I always put it on after a shower, sleep with it on and rinse off in the morning. Color is pretty natural considering I orange easy with fake tans. To apply I just use disposable gloves to avoid orange hands and tha works fine in blending in the mousse evenly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews but I love this product.  I have tried many products over the years and was fairly satisfied with the Neutrogena foam which they don&#x27;t make anymore.  I did find a few retailers on Amazon that had it for $60.00 + !!  No way I was paying that so I thought since this was a mouse it may be ok.  Oh my!!  I love the shade of tan this gives, not orange or fake at all, it looks like a natural tan.  I also love that the product is pretty much mistake proof because of the bronzer in it.  I was a little put off when I first saw the color and tried it on a hidden area in fear that it may be look green but I am sure its the green tint that makes it look natural and not fake orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great too!  And I received it in less than a week (the delivery time said 3 weeks) so I was excited that I received it much sooner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends. No smell or lines after applying. If you already have a tan I would recommend getting the dark color instead of the medium. I say its a must have!! Love love love!</li>
    <li> First a word about St. Tropez, as I recently finished my first bottle.  St. Tropez provided the best color, scent, and streak-free application I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;m fair, so the medium color makes a notable difference in my skin tone.  If they offered a fair - medium application, it would probably be perfect for my face, in lieu of foundation.  My only wish (other than a lower price) is that the color lasted longer - I only get 2-3 days&#x27; color per application.  Given the price difference between St. Tropez and St. Moriz, I then decided to try the latter, which others posted to be ST&#x27;s knock off.  I&#x27;ve found St. Moritz to be pretty darned close to ST in all aspects.  For the price difference, I&#x27;ll stick with St. Moritz.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite self tanner ever. It leaves a nice natural tan instead of a orange color. Only complaint is that i wish it lasted longer, but that may also be because i don&#x27;t properly exfoliate my skin beforehand.</li>
    <li> been purchasing and trying out alot of different self tanners, this one and Fake Bake are by far the best,  but for the price of this one, there is no need to even look any further! Dont buy expecting not to smell, all self tanners smell, its just part of it. Theres not much difference among all brands.</li>
    <li> although I got the product half empty because it spilled on its way to me! they refunded all of my money and overall good tanner so will buy again</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! It goes on even and dries quickly! It does stain your palms though so id suggest applying it with medical gloves on. Washing your hands does NOT help get the stain out. The &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade is very dark. I have medium toned skin and this makes me look like I&#x27;ve been at the beach for weeks! It does almost come completely off in the shower though :( but for the price, you can re apply when you get out of the shower. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best tanning method I have ever used. I&#x27;ve even cancelled my tanning membership because this makes me tan faster, is healthier, and looks completely natural. I love how easy it is to fix any mistakes the next day and how fast it dries. The best tip I&#x27;ve found is to use it before bed and take a light shower in the morning if you want it to be subtle. If you&#x27;re hoping for a jaw dropping makeover, shower 24 hours later. Would definitely recommend to anyone hoping to add some color.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Cheap.  Works AWESOME... However... it takes FOREVER to arrive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these last winter.  I believe the two bottles took over a month to reach me.  These two bottles have lasted me over a year.  Just threw the other one out and still have a quarter left to the other.  It comes out as a brown foam.  There is absolutely no orange tinge to this at all.  You MUST MUST MUST exfoliate/lotion/prep before using this.  If you are using this in the winter time and your skin is dry, DON&#x27;T DO IT!  You will look like a scaly lizard.  Make sure your skin has good moisture before applying.  Also- scrub the helllll out of your hands after application!  I use a toothbrush on my palms to get into the cracks and crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product, I just ordered another bottle.  Can&#x27;t do without it in these horrible New Jersey winters.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice self tanner. It works and looks just as good as St. Trpeze, but is friendlier to your wallet.</li>
    <li> I started using St Moriz products when recommended in a specialty store as a sunless product that won&#x27;t turn me orange and won&#x27;t clean out my wallet.  Just don&#x27;t over do it, use the mitt and you&#x27;ll be surprised as how natural you&#x27;ll look.</li>
    <li> I have used several self tanners and the color and scent of this one are by far the best. I can use it in the morning without having to worry about smelling bad, and it gives a nice even natural looking color. Highly recommend especially for the price!!</li>
    <li> The tanning mousse is good.  The color comes out nice, not too dark.  I did have to do about two applications to get a darker color like i wanted.  It takes a few minutes to dry.</li>
    <li> This is about the same as others, nice consistency, color is okay too.  But, this does a far greater job on your hands than where you intend it to be.  I don&#x27;t use gloves in the bathroom usually, but unless you want to scrub for awhile on your fingers and nails, wear some.</li>
    <li> When I received this product, the envelope in which it was shipped was soaked with tanning solution, leaving the bottle almost half empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I actually LOVE the product, I do not like the fact that almost half of it was gone upon arrival due to negligent packaging.  I don&#x27;t understand why/how the seller thinks this product can travel safely from the UK to the USA in a thin paper envelope.  Had this product been shipped properly within a small box, the margin for leaking and spilling would have been eradicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I contacted the seller to notify them that their product&#x27;s shipping methods damaged my item, I did not hear back from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the customer service would have been more attentive to my issue, I would have rated this a 5-star product because the tanning solution goes on flawlessly, dried quickly, and has virtually no sunless tanning after-scent.  I use latex gloves to apply it.  Also, the color is very natural.  I have fair skin and the medium solution is perfect.  It&#x27;s not too dark but it is a noticeable, light brown tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product took about two weeks to get to me, but was actually worth the wait.  I would stock this product if I knew that it would get to me without the spilling/leaking problems OR if I knew that the company&#x27;s customer service department would respond properly to my issue.</li>
    <li> I have tried many self tanners, but never a mousse before. I can honestly say I don&#x27;t ever want to go back to lotions or sprays after using this. I found the color to be a great color for this time of year (end of winter/ beginning of spring). The color is just enough to look sun kissed without looking like you are trying too hard. Which is always a plus to look effortless. The smell I didn&#x27;t even notice. I had to stick my nose in the bottle and sniff to smell the product because during the application I did not smell anything (again another plus). Overall it is my favorite self tanner I have used with my second favorite being Equate beauty spray. I do recommend gloves for this application. I think gloves would work better than a mitt because no product would be wasted, and also having full range of motion eases the blending process. Great product I already ordered another bottle in the dark shade for my summer regimen.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome! It&#x27;s super cheap and works amazing. It leaves some streaks when putting it on but I found once you shower the next day most of those streaks go away. It leaves a perfect color and I love it! The only bad thing about it is I found it doesn&#x27;t last very long! Definietly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> This tanning mousse is a great value for the price. The color is very natural and is noticeable upon one application. I would recommend this for those of you that have practiced application before, because it can develop streaky if not thoroughly rubbed in, and you do not have an infinite amount of time to do that in. I do really enjoy this mousse, and it is great for those on a budget. It can be a bit drying, so make sure you are moisturizing your skin, otherwise, this tan will fade a bit patchy.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed by this self-tanner! It doesn&#x27;t streak, the color is perfect, and it lasts for almost a week if you do your prep work correctly. It takes a little while to receive, but it&#x27;s well worth it.    I&#x27;m fair-skinned, and I use the medium. What I love the most is that you can put on more or less, depending on your skin tone at the time. For example, in the winter I&#x27;ll use one application and I get some color without looking like I&#x27;ve used self tanner. In the summer when I have a little more natural color, I can use one application to get a little darker, or I can use more than one application to be really dark. Either way, it never looks like self-tanner. It&#x27;s just a naturally beautiful tone. I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
    <li> the only self-tanner i&#x27;ve ever used on my pasty white skin that turned me brown and NOT orange! the smell isn&#x27;t horrible either.</li>
    <li> Great price and nice results</li>
    <li> Color to it was ok.  Use gloves when applying stains like crazy lol,...  But good product overall.  Smells funky too</li>
    <li> I generally use Jergen&#x27;s Gradual Tan lotion as it looks nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t give a fake looking tan but I wanted to try this St Moriz Self Tanning Mousse as I&#x27;ve heard many good reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely gives a nice color to the skin, however I find it rather inconvenient to use due to the guide color. Most folks who review it state they put it on at night and shower off the guide color in the morning - but for me being a woman with all white sheets this is not an option. I have only used the product once so far so I am going to use it up and try to find a system for it to work for me but I foresee myself going back to my Jergens.</li>
    <li> First of all I am a fair skinned redhead with freckles. As you can imagine, I don&#x27;t expect to find a lot of tanners that will look good on me, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them. I&#x27;m mostly just looking for a little natural color to take away the Elmer&#x27;s glue skin tone I got goin on. This tanner has a nice color, but that is all that&#x27;s good about it. First thing, it took FOREVER to get here - it is shipping from England so I expected a wait (delivery was expected in 5-7 weeks) Luckily I didn&#x27;t need it in a hurry - I hoped to have it for a trip to Mexico so I ordered it a couple of months in advance just so I could try it before the trip. When it was 5 days past the latest projected delivery date and I still hadn&#x27;t received it, I contacted the seller. They were very nice and responded quickly. They hadn&#x27;t gotten it back, so it got lost or something. They were great and immediately sent a new one out, and I got that in about 2.5 weeks. The 1 star isn&#x27;t for the customer service, because it was fantastic. When I got the mousse, it was in a padded envelope. I opened it and the plastic top on the bottle was coated inside with runny brown tanner, and it had leaked all down the bottle. I cleaned it up, shook the mousse, and pumped some out into my hand - it spit runny brown liquid (not mousse) all over my sink and cupboard. Huge mess. I kept shaking it and when I would pump it was the same thing. Finally it kind cleared up and came out as a mousse. I would never dare travel with this stuff seeing the mess it made. As far as color, it is really pretty good, but I find it doesn&#x27;t rub in very well. Maybe it&#x27;s the mousse consistency and I&#x27;m more used to lotion, but it was tough to blend. Unfortunately, the color doesn&#x27;t last at ALL. It reminds me of those bronzers you apply for immediate color that only last until you shower because that is what happened. I waited a good hour of drying time before I got dressed and it still totally rubbed off all over my bra and ruined it. I waited 24 hours to shower (with no working out or sweating - believe me, I know my tanner application do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts). When I got in the shower it was a river of St. Moritz running down the drain. I mean I didn&#x27;t retain the color AT ALL. Huge bummer. I was super excited for this due to all the reviews, and it was a huge disappointment from the delivery to the shower that washed it all away!</li>
    <li> The best self tanner out there! I will not buy another self tanner! I recommend this for any skin types! I have repurchased this item several times!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The color that you get is amazing, very very dark. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, I use a glove for application. This mousse does not streak and after you apply you are instantly left with a deep dark tan. The only things that I don&#x27;t like is how it fades after a couple of days, it looks very bad. Your skin gets a cracked look, like some sort of skin disease. For this reason I can&#x27;t use this everyday the way I would like to. I only use it on the weekends or if I am going out. The other thing I don&#x27;t like about this tanner is that if you get a drop of water on your skin while using this product your beautiful tan disappears from you skin leaving you with crazy looking white spots. I will still continue to use this mousse just because I love the color so much but like I said I can&#x27;t use it as often as I would like to and I am extra, extra careful as not to get any water on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have finally found something that works for me. I love this self tanning mousse...I always have problems with products turning orange on my skin, well no more.  You can see St. Moriz as you put it on therefore you can make it as light or dark as you want.  It has almost no odor, and the product leaves you with a warm brown bronze (not orange at all). It only lasts about 2-3 days but is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of heE St. Tropez that I purchased for about 50$.  I applied the St. Moritz on the right side of my body and the St. Tropez on the left.  very slight difference was the the St. Moritz side was a bit darker so I actually prefer the results of St. Moritz as well as the price over St. Tropez.  for me this is a no brainer Ill go with the St. Moritz any day</li>
    <li> Color looks natural and is pretty easy to apply...but you still must be careful and MUST wash the mit between uses or it will streak and look splotchy.</li>
    <li> This mousse is horrible.  I ended up throwing it away.  It went on super dark and looked so fake.  I was very disappointed and do not recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used. You definitely will want to wear gloves when applying. People comment about  what a great tan I have. They are fooled!</li>
    <li> Love this tanning mousse, it gives great natural looking color. I am extremely fair and I feel like it washes off very easily, but I just re-apply and it lasts about 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> It is super easy to apply, especially with the special application glove, no streaks, rich, natural looking color. I am very impressed especially for the price. I would recommend moisturizing dry areas on your skin before applying self tanner because color gets darker on dry areas.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the one handful of product I got to use it is a very nice color. However, I only got one handful. When I received the product the package was entirely folded in half the product was all over. Extremely poor packaging it was pretty much just wrapped in paper and I was highly disappointed in the cheapness of the company that sent this to me. I would like another product sent to me free of charge to replace my waste of money.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Has little to no smell!!!&lt;br /&gt;Color is great. You must get the mitt to go with the product other wise it won&#x27;t work right. Dries quick and really not many bad things to say about it. Only downside for me was the mitt only seemed to last for about 2-3 uses before I has to throw it out and get another, but that&#x27;s it. Super cheap and really great if you have super pale skin like me.</li>
    <li> Instant color! But wear gloves, will really stain hands! Blends well and looks natural, not orange. Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this self tanner and have tried all the top brands. You must wear gloves as it is a foam and immediately seeps into your hands. My hands were black within 30 seconds and i had to scrub to remove it. After it was applied it smelled worst then most of the self tanners and unfortunately faded very quickly (1-2 days). I also noticed it started to peel off on my neck leaving me with a noticeable spot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and liking it for years, but just a few issues of note. The package says &amp;#34;mess free.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s far from that and will dye everything it touches with muddy prints. Use gloves, otherwise your palms will instantly turn dark brown and it&#x27;s so hard to remove. It does give me a very natural tan, not orange at all, and I do like that it has a tint so I can see exactly where I&#x27;ve applied it. The tint is much darker than the actual tan, and will wash off, but it is pretty all the same. Toss the bottle after you&#x27;ve had it for a year, because the color will change to dark green over time. Yikes.</li>
    <li> I have used a dozen different self tanners and this one is the most natural looking.  It&#x27;s more of a brown then an orange.  It also fades slower then most others.  They aren&#x27;t joking when they say to use a glove to apply.  You will be walking around with brown hands of shame otherwise!</li>
    <li> Im a constant buyer of St.Moriz, I love their dark mousse and lotion, they give me a beautiful golden tan, which is shocking considering how all self tanners turn me orange. Back to the medium shade mousse, it goes on smooth with a mit, but unlike dark there is barely any real colour guide once you rub it in making it hard to see what you are doing, I put this on in the afternoon and washed it off the next morning only to be completely orange. I love the dark shade and will stick with it. The seller shipped it to my house in less than a week, so thats a plus.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it&#x27;s hard to work with. I read the reviews before I ordered and used this product so I was prepared. I think mousses are just harder to work with than lotions are. Definitely use gloves and make sure your skin is moisturized before applying, That can be probematic though, you don&#x27;t want to use a lotion that&#x27;s going to interfere with the tanning process of this product. Good luck!</li>
    <li> the color is hardly existant. maybe if you are really pale this will give you some color. leaves bad scent on skin as well</li>
    <li> I liked the color it turned my skin.  The problem is that it does come off on your clothes, even when dry.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is absolutely wonderful! It is fairly inexpensive, but works like a charm! I use the shade DARK because I am not too fair-skinned. The color is not orange at all, it blends evenly (I prefer to use the tanning mitt) and doesn&#x27;t leave that HORRIBLE self tanner smell. I typically apply this before bed, and it dries really fast! I just take a quick shower in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go! Great product! Would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Just as good as St. Tropez for 1/2 the price.  Easy to apply &amp; gives a nice glow.  Lasts for several days.</li>
    <li> Bought this on the spur of the moment.. OMG really worth it! Wear gloves. Lotion your ankles, knees, hands, feet and toes.  Vaseline will block it from nail beds but be careful...I had about a 1/2 in or less blocked on my toes the first time. Q-tip is best to use instead of finger. Fads off pretty naturally also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St Tropez mousse and really liked it, except for the price! I thought I would give this a try. I actually like the St Moriz BETTER! It has less smell when it&#x27;s developing. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have the green tint that St Tropez does. I can put this on and go out in public without looking a funny color. Try it if you&#x27;re a St Tropez fan. It&#x27;s much more affordable and you might like it just as well!</li>
    <li> Love the color and faded even</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Tropez for the last 3 yrs. Its getting very pricey so I figured I would try this instead. I prefer the mousse instead of a cream. I think its easier to apply. I am very fair skinned. Irish, blond hair, blue eye&#x27;s. This tanner is beautiful. The color is not as dark as the St. Tropez (which is fine for me) If you are looking for a darker tan, this may not be for you. I guess you could apply a second coat to darken it up. You can&#x27;t beat the price on this. Make sure you get a tanning mitt. It goes on so much smoother.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best find I had this summer.  I had no streaks and was super tan with a few pumps.  I used the medium and was way tan!  I hope they keep making this for a long long time.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this more... particularly since I love St. Tropez, and this is a knockoff!  The initial color is great, but when you shower, it&#x27;s much, much lighter, and it doesn&#x27;t fade evenly.  I&#x27;m a super pale redhead, and I really cannot see much of a difference after one application.  Pretty good for the price but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll re-purchase.</li>
    <li> PERFECT! especially for the price. I haven&#x27;t had it rub off on anything &amp; it drys so fast. what a great find</li>
    <li> Best product for the price! I&#x27;ve tried numerous expensive brands and this one works as well as salon overprice brands.  Best way to get even beautiful color is to use bare hands (the gloves make it streaky) it goes on with instant color so you know where you have missed and need to apply more.  Wash hands often during application using good soap so your hands won&#x27;t stain.  Let dry one hour before clothing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I love it because it goes on smooth and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. The only drawback is the color washes off during the shower. Do not use any white towels! Don&#x27;t let me mislead you, some color will stay, but you do lose a lot of color down the drain, if they could stop that, they would have one PERFECT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Arrived a week later after ordering - very good for it being in the UK.  Also I noticed myself getting a tan right after the first application...probably because I always forget to wash it off later that day so then the next day when I get in the shower viola&#x27; -I&#x27;m tan!  Note I am fair complected and I ordered medium and I wear it in the spring just to give myself a little color so that when I wear dresses or shorts I don&#x27;t look like Casper and blind everybody lol.  This won&#x27;t make you instantly tan if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for and if you&#x27;re like me and didn&#x27;t want to purchase a mitt then prepare to have brown hands even after washing them...but later on that day it wore off and finally looked normal.  Worth the $6!</li>
    <li> Works well. Looks real as long as you spend the time carefully rubbing it on to be sure it&#x27;s  evenly distributed.  Feet are the hardest to achieve this quality. I use a nail brush on my hands to avoid staining of the palms.</li>
    <li> I know the struggle is real when it comes to keeping a nice base color and not looking too fake and orange. This product worked wonders for me. My skin felt so smooth and healthy and looked like I was naturally sun kissed. It was so easy to apply and you didn&#x27;t need a lot because the mousse really spreads all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it sets in right away so your instantly golden. I would just recommend to moisturize your body and especially your face before hand. I liked to do it right after the shower so my pores are open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not streaky at all because of how I applied it: plastic gloves on and rubbing in a circular motion with both hands as if you were giving yourself a massage. Try to keep it light around the feet and when you&#x27;re done with your entire body and face you can take the gloves off, moisturize your hands with lotion, put a smidge of the mousse in your palm and rub it all around your hands and wrists. After a few seconds I wash my hands gently and it looks like the right amount of tan on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my back I just used my flexible arms to reach back there and rub it in because the mousse is so lightweight that it&#x27;s super easy to spread around. I did get a back reacher-thingy too but I prefered to use my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews. This is the first one I&#x27;ve ever written because this product just wowed me especially since I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for that perfect tan since I can remember. Definitely give it a whirl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Kate, 20</li>
    <li> I was nervous buying this due to the bad reviews , but this product is a wonderful brown color, no orange at all. I recommend some type of tanning mitt because it is tricky to rub in evenly but is wonderful for super pale people like me</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner available.  I am VERY fair and burn easily....and the burn doesn&#x27;t turn into a tan.  I have tried almost every other self tanner available and they always made me look orange or streaky....you could tell it was fake.  The first time I tried this mousse I was amazed because you immediately see the color. This tan looks completely natural!! It stays on for about a week with one application but if you apply every other day you will have an amazing tan all summer long.  It does have the typical tanner smell but that dissipates once you shower.  I have stocked up on this so that I never run out! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a bronzed look without using sun.</li>
    <li> The medium tint is both natural looking and easy to spot flaws before it&#x27;s too late! I bought the foam mitt, to help apply the product evenly. My tan lasted 4-6 days, showering regularly. I suggest leaving some tan lines, so you can see for yourself. My only complaint is that shipping took the legit 4-6 weeks - which feels like eternity if you&#x27;re spoiled by Prime membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results: read the instructions, apply lotion to key areas (knees, ankles, feet, elbows and wrists), apply with the mitt in sweeping circles... in the daylight, with a mirror available and TAKE YOUR TIME - the difference between a 10 minute application and a 2 minute pat down will show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For terrible results: Apply right after the shower to towel-dried skin, in fluorescent bathroom lighting,and/or apply in 4 minutes or less (I have done this, luckily only to my legs). Also, don&#x27;t apply with your bare hands - you&#x27;ve saved the money buying this product, splurge for the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve made a mistake, I have had marginal success lightening up the \\&quot;dirty ankle\\&quot; look (from my rush job), with a diluted mix of Spray&amp;Wash Clothes Stain pre-treatment with hot water &amp; a wash rag, otherwise a daily exfoliant will be your best friend.</li>
    <li> Works great! It&#x27;s similar to the St. Tropez line of self tanners. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results! I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this tanning mousse! It&#x27;s so much more affordable than all the other expensive brands and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I have a fair complexion and this mousse gave me a nice sun kissed glow without looking like an orange oompa loompa. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; without all the hassle of sitting out in the sun.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as St. Tropez but a whole lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried MANY different self-tanners.  It dries quickly, spreads evenly, and gives a great color.  It&#x27;s not orangy- much more natural and longer lasting than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Very natural and buildable tan.  I tried St. Tropez first and liked that too but I like this one better and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  Keep in mind shipping takes a couple weeks.  Manufacturer...please keep this product around and I will buy it forever.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the St. Moriz Tanning Mousse on Amazon after watching a review on youtube by laurenbeautyy. I am so pleased with the results! I ordered it when I was packing up my dorm at the end of the semester, and a week after I got home the product arrived in the mail. I was excited to get it so soon, because the predicted date of arrival was in the middle of July! The mousse gave me a nice, natural bronze color without looking fake, and the guide color made it easy to see where I was applying the product. I bought 3 bottles and paid $20 including shipping cost! Hey, that&#x27;s half the price of St. Tropez, and I can&#x27;t complain! I will definitely buy this product again :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  The application is easy, but you have to be careful because it can stain more in one area than an other if you are not quickly rubbing the product in.  It&#x27;s best if you take small areas at a time and apply.  The only problem I have had is that after I have applied it for a couple of days, after that I notice that it starts to apply uneven in certain areas.  This could be that my skin is not moisturized?  I tend to have more dry skin.  I do exfoliate before application, so I know that&#x27;s not the problem.  All in all, it is a nice product for quick color and I will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I am very very pale and I am really the only one in my family that is very pale, so I decided to order this on a whim. I am in love. The shipping estimate was about 3 weeks and I got it in a week! The color it gives is amazing for me. (If you are looking for something a little darker you can either layer it up or get the dark bottle) It lasted about 3 days on my upper body and 4/5 on my legs and feet. It is not at all streaky as long as you pay attention to where you&#x27;re putting it. If you do make a mistake just take a warm wash cloth and wipe it right away and start over. Over all this is a great product and I will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I like the color tan it gave me. It ships from outside the US when I got it it had leaked out some so I don&#x27;t know if that effected the color. I usually use fake bake but this was cheaper. Defiantly buy a mitt to put on</li>
    <li> Blows every other tanner out of the water. It leaves a tint on your skin after you apply it so there&#x27;s no guess work to where you&#x27;ve put it or not. This makes me a golden brown with 2 applications. (I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned). I apply once or twice a week and It lasts until I exfoliate again. Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and goes on even easy to apply, but the color does not last long at all</li>
    <li> The mousse worked okay.  I am pale with freckles and you could definitely tell after two hours that I had a \\&quot;tan,\\&quot; but it turned out to be too much of an orange-y shade for me.  The color was also very \\&quot;spotty,\\&quot; and I could see every spot of product making up my tan.  So it&#x27;s definitely not attractive up close.  When I took a shower to get rid of the color tint that everyone talks about, everything washed off.  Oh well! I really wanted to try this product and I&#x27;m glad I know how it works.  Since I have a whole bottle and it washes off I will probably try it again with a better applicator (makeup sponge or specialized glove)to see if that improves my experience.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I&#x27;m wondering if some of the unhappy users are confusing the temporary color on your skin from the tinted mousse (which rinses away the first time you shower, and then leaves you a slightly lighter color) for the actual tan. I&#x27;m glad the tint washes away (but be sure to wait 4-6 hours to shower) because right after I apply the mousse, my skin looks a little \\&quot;muddy\\&quot; from it. But that&#x27;s just to help show where you&#x27;ve already applied it.</li>
    <li> This turned a weird color on me and it was actually hard to blend. I was surprised it was compared to St Tropez.</li>
    <li> This tanning mousse exceeded my expectations! Once I applied and waited a few minutes- I absolutely loved the color. I had to use more than I expected but I still have most of the bottle. It goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This self tanning mousse is great! No streaks, no unpleasant odor, and it works! Plus, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price!</li>
