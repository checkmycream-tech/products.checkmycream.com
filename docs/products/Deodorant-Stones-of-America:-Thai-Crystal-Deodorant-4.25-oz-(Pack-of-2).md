<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is awesome! I really don&#x27;t know how it works but I know it works. No odors, no staining, no rashes for delicate skin. I even let my nine year old use with the same results. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wanted to move away from traditional deodorants, so I tried just about everything and had a negative reaction to just about everything. Tom&#x27;s of Maine (crazy underarm redness and skin peeling), baking soda and coconut oil (skin peeling), other store brand aluminum-free deodorants (ineffective AND skin peeling), and beeswax/essential oils (didn&#x27;t even come close to working).&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I stumbled upon deodorant stones. When I first started transitioning away from traditional deodorants, I used both a stone AND a crystal deodorant roll-on. Once the roll-on was gone, I was all stone and no stink! And really, no wetness either. My pits got used to not having that antiperspirant part so now they&#x27;re permanently dry. I shower at night, and apply this after my shower and in the morning for 24 hr protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Works extremely well!&lt;br /&gt;Healthy for your body!&lt;br /&gt;No artificial fragrances!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;You have to wet the stone and apply it to the underarms. Some people require a long (20 sec) application time. I only go for about 6 seconds, but to each their own!&lt;br /&gt;If you are of the armpit shaving inclination and you apply this right after, it&#x27;ll burn. Don&#x27;t worry! It&#x27;s not an allergic reaction! Shaving causes tiny abrasions in the skin, and you&#x27;re rubbing salt in it. No big deal. If you experience pain after more than a minute or two, reconsider using this.&lt;br /&gt;If you drop it, it might just crack. Drop hazard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product. Love it!</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve written in many other reviews, my wife is very fussy about the ingredients in the personal care products that my family uses.  She tries to avoid deodorants that contain aluminum chlorohydrate, perfumes, artificial colors, and any chemicals we cannot pronounce.  This stone is made of natural mineral salts with no odor or added chemicals. She swears that this works better than any other deodorant she has used, that it is non-staining, and likes that there is no odor.  She has recommended it to many people, who are now satisfied users.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Good stuff. So far no B.O. The hot chicks LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I like knowing that it&#x27;s a nature alternative to regular deodorant, but if you drop it, it breaks easily and you&#x27;ve wasted your money.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. I have tried many natural deodorants, none of which really worked. After finally getting fed up with feeling stinky all the time, I did some research online to find something more effective. Several sources recommended Thai crystal along with other (much more expensive and less long-lasting) options. I&#x27;d tried another mineral salt deodorant in the past (Crystal brand), but it ended up melting into extremely abrasive shards over time and I gave it up. I assumed this was just how crystals worked. So far, however, this has NOT been the case with the Thai crystal. In fact, it was another review mentioning specifically that it stays smooth over time that convinced me to try it. I just bought another for my oldest son and he quickly noticed that the package mentions that it works on feet, too. He suggested I buy one for his younger brother...</li>
    <li> I swear by these.  The only antiperspirant I will use.  The chemicals will not absorb into your body and cause the aluminum problems associated with commercial products.  You just have to learn how much to swipe it onto your body to give you protection.</li>
    <li> This deodorant stick WORKS! We have tried so many different natural deodorants and have a shoebox full of ones I&#x27;ve bought on amazon over the past year that don&#x27;t get the job done. With this one I don&#x27;t smell and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any perfume smell as that is the worst when you mix that with stinky sweat! It will last me all day if I put on a lot (like 25 passes under each arm). I&#x27;m sold on this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  Works just has it says, stay fresh all day, and cost will be so much less than old stick deodorant, because Stone is to last a year.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t and I know because let&#x27;s be honest ...I am way smarter than you are. Get Crystal.  I have never worked for Crystal but I have done some work on a Crystal before. Heyo!</li>
    <li> First I would like to say that I have a serious, very serious underarm odor of musty smell after being in the heat for lets say 10 minutes with regular deo! I am the cleanest person, shower 2-3 times a day, but its just those pits that wont quit! in the wintertime I&#x27;m fine, regular deo will do its job decently, but fall, spring and summer, be with me!! I guess when I sweat its over for me, the underarm smell hits hard, But not with this crystal, oh my goodness its the best thing that ever happen to me. I do use it accompanied with the crystal spray, since you have to wet it, I wet underarm with spray instead of wetting crystal with water, and then apply crystal generously, I really have to apply it in a big circle and in between for it to work like its suppose to and with the spray that&#x27;s what works for me the best! It does work fine on its own for my boyfriend also, who doesn&#x27;t even have to apply it everyday, every other and he is good! But that&#x27;s him, not me!! So if you have the problem like I do please give it a try, it really works!!</li>
    <li> It has no scent at all. This is a deodorant according to the label but it has absolutely no scent.</li>
    <li> Got rid of some odor the first 2 weeks, but then my armpits got a rash and an odd odor shortly thereafter.</li>
    <li> Your body needs a few days to get accustomed to it, but then after that it works really well! Now I always avoid putting on regular deodorant.</li>
    <li> Thought, hey why not try something different might work. If you like to feel dumb using something this is for you. If you have to tell yourself I think it&#x27;s working, maybe? It&#x27;s time to move on.</li>
    <li> I placed several drops of lavender oil and let it soak into the stone for a light fragrance and it has worked very well so far. I rinse to wet it and work it around under my arm for 5-10 sec. Then, I rinse and repeat under the other arm. Rinse one last time and store with the top off until it dries. It works just as well as the commercial products with highly ionized Aluminum in it for me.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase! This deodorant works very well and packaging was excellent and shipping was very prompt. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I decided to hold of on the review until i really get to see its long lasting effects. The good news is that it doesn&#x27;t make me itch like all those store bought deodorants, the bad, it&#x27;s not strong enough. If you dont sweat that much, this is a good buy, but as a guy who sweats a lot, and I&#x27;m in fairly good shape, this deodorant doesn&#x27;t do much. No wetness protection and starts to wear off only after a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. I suffer from sensitive skin, and regular deodorants cause painful underarm breakouts. Thai deodorant stick kept my skin looking great and I didn&#x27;t sweat as much. One stick lasted me over a year!</li>
    <li> Let me say that I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this product, as my experience with natural products is that they typically are not as effective as their \\&quot;man-made\\&quot; counterparts.  I decided to give one of these deodorant stones a try, though, and I have been amazed by it.  You simply run it under the faucet for a second and then apply it.  It is very easy to use, leaves no residue, and is highly effective.  It does not cover up the smell as other deodorants do; it kills the bacteria that cause the odor.  It lasts for at least 24 hours, too.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the quality of the product. Great deodorant, no smell, does not leave stains on clothes, goes on completely clear.</li>
    <li> This crystal did not work at all for me.  I think it might work for someone who is primarily sedentary, but its surely not an athlete friendly product.  I am disappointed to say this as I was very excited after seeing all these positive reviews.  But hey, maybe I&#x27;m just a really smelly guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m back to axe!</li>
    <li> I never had problems with body odor until after giving birth to my daughter. My hormones changed and BAM! Body odor problems. I tried numerous OTC deodorants and the only kind that worked for me was Secret Clinical Strength, and honestly, after a hard workout sometimes it failed me. My husband came across this product online and we thought, heck, lets give it a try. He doesn&#x27;t have problems with body odor, but me, I was SUPER skeptical.I was nervous about trying it out and really trusting this product to work as no one wants to be \\&quot;that person who smells\\&quot;. I have worn it for about 2 weeks now and I have not once had any problems with body odor. I have worked in my garden, been through hard core workouts at the gym and sweated like a pig, but not a bit of odor. I am so impressed with this product and would recommend it to anyone. My only slight issue with the product is that I can&#x27;t put it on directly after shaving my armpits as it causes a bit of stinging and little red irritation bumps, but I solved that problem by shaving my armpits at night, and using the stone the following morning. Since doing this I have had no problems.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a family member and I was truly amazed. After a few days of using this product I loved it. I switched to this deodorant so that I was not using a product that included the ingredient aluminum and I am hooked. Will buy this product for life. Thai stick was received within 2 days or ordering. The stick will probably last years!  For the price I paid i will not have to purchase deodorant for years. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used both the pump spray bottle of this brand (pre-mixed with water) and the stone and both work wonderfully.  The spray bottle I tended to use about 4-6 pumps per underarm and that would last me all day.  I tested this product in the heat of the summer near 90 degrees and in humidity.  If you sweat a lot or plan to be outside all day I would say you should carry it with you and re-apply.  In the winter time like it is now) I can just apply the stone once and it lasts all day.  The only down side to this product that I&#x27;ve found is that if I use too much my skin can become irritated.  I believe that your body chemistry and bacteria production changes daily so maybe my body doesn&#x27;t need as much at certain times and the skin finds the salt to be too much?  Not sure but when this starts to happen I just use less and have just as good of a result.  I have been using this for months now and will not go back to traditional anti-perspirants again!  If you buy the spray expect it to last about a month or two...it&#x27;s also great on your feet (no odor in your shoes).  The crystal will last a year+ (no kidding).  I have had my crystal stone for about 2 months now and can&#x27;t even put a dent in it.</li>
    <li> I have ezema and developed a strong odour...I was forced to use prescription strength deodorant. The strong stuff worked for a while but it seemed to only mask the odour. I grew concerned and started shopping around for stuff and bumped into this natural deo on my supermarket shelf. It is a gift sent from God...all natural and cured my smelly armpits. I was amazed and delighted because anti-persperants are unhealthy due to their aluminium content. I must advise that when you start using the stick you will need to lather it on well and then gradually you will realise that you can actually go  without deo and your arm will not smell! This is the best invention since sliced bread! I have recommended this to all my friends and family members...and the best thing is that my beautiful shirts and dresses don&#x27;t have discoloured armpits!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a natural deodorant free from aluminum. Bought this based on the reviews. I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater and had high hopes for this product. Well, it did not work AT ALL- yuck and embarrassing day at work.</li>
    <li> As someone who has become allergic to every deodorant on the shelves over the last few years, I gave this a try. Was not expecting the results I got!! It really works! I put it on every morning and am good for the day. I even do heavy manual work outside and have no odor after a day of being outside. I really recommend this product for anyone who finds themselves becoming allergic to regular deodorants.</li>
    <li> It took me a while till find a real natural product for sweating. I refused to use antitranspirant, I tried several organic deodorants but they didnt work so well. Now with Thai Deodorant I feel so confident that Im not smelling bad at all. As I read in another comment, you have to apply generously in all the area.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Lasts forever!</li>
    <li> This product is all natural and it works great. All you have to do is wet it and roll it over your underarm area. I like this better than the spray. The stick dries faster.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent seller.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all .  I am disappointed and was excited to try  after seeing all the positive reviews. baking soda and coconut oil worked better for me than this .</li>
    <li> I could never wear this and be confident around other people. It just doesn&#x27;t stop the smell as good as I&#x27;d hope. I might wear it around the house, but never out in public because it wears off on me. I wore it for a few months exclusively but it never got better. Even straight out of the shower, if I put this stick on I can smell some funk unless I wash the stick well before applying but that doesn&#x27;t always work. This could work for some people but I can&#x27;t trust if for long and it&#x27;s a hassle to reapply--take off shirt, wash pits, wet stick, reapply, dry, put shirt back on -- hope it works. I definitely can&#x27;t wear it all day and overnight but maybe in combo with another deodorant. I have yet to find a natural deodorant and have even tried many homemade/baking soda type. The baking soda works but is irritating. I have also tried crystal spray, herbal clear, tom&#x27;s, among others but only aluminum-based works so far.</li>
    <li> WOW!  This stuff is amazing!  Just for the hell of it, to test it out, I didn&#x27;t shower for three days to give this stuff the stink test.  It passed with flying colors.  Normally, I would apply regular deodorant after a shower and the next day...I wouldn&#x27;t pass the stink test. I don&#x27;t know what is in this thing but it is awesome.  To add to its awesomeness, there are no toxic chemicals in this product like there is in regular deodorant. So glad I bought two of them. Am considering buying a few more incase this product suddenly disappears from the marketplace.</li>
    <li> I have used a crystal deoderant stick for the last several years. (That&#x27;s how long one stick lasted!) I&#x27;m now down to a few little pieces of the original, and don&#x27;t remember which brand I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed they were all alike, and bought the &#x27;Thai Crystal&#x27; stick, which was definitely not the one I bought previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Thai product actually makes me smell worse!  (Actually, &#x27;stink&#x27; would not be too big a stretch.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like others have been very happy with this product, so it may be something odd about me.  And because I so loved my prior crystal, I&#x27;m going to try another brand...</li>
    <li> For years now I have been trying different deodorants and although most of them worked fine for me in terms of protection, my skin became so sensitive to most of them that after a while it became painful to put any kind of deodorant on. My armpits had these \\&quot;burn marks\\&quot; for years and although I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure that the deodorants were responsible for them I thought the marks would never go away. Then I found out about Thai Crystal and initially I was turned off by the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent. I didn&#x27;t think that would offer any kind of real protection so after buying it I didn&#x27;t even try using it for about a year. Then one day the burn marks got so bad that I was willing to try anything to get rid of them. After less than a week of using Thai the burn marks disappeared COMPLETELY! I just couldn&#x27;t believe it! I started telling my friends and family about this product and found out that some of them had been experiencing the exact same problems with their deodorants. It&#x27;s been almost two months now and I feel totally protected and it&#x27;s not harming my skin in any way. I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t sell this product in all stores, especially since it is kind of expensive so they would be making good money on it. I wish I had found this product years ago.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product, as I have tried many natural deodorant sticks throughout the years, but this time I was proven wrong!  I used the product as soon as I got it, and it lasted all day.  I can understand how some people might need to add it more than once a day (if you are a heavy sweater or extremely stinky), but that was definitely not the case with me.      This product does not keep you from sweating, which is fine with me, as I feel sweating is important to release toxins, but it does keep you from stinking.  I feel like I will get good use of this product - I can see it easily lasting a year.  I think this product is also good for children who are entering puberty.  If we can keep our kids/tweens from depending on products that contain potentially harmful chemicals (aluminum), than we are starting them off on a good path.  I also like that this product is cruelty free and uses natural minerals.      I am very glade I found this product and I am now a life-long fan!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It works better than any other deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s all natural. I didn&#x27;t believe it until I tried it myself! No odor - ever! I would highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I think it will last a really long time.</li>
    <li> The rock salt Thai deodorant stone works quite well as an antiperspirant, without any added scents or other ingredients, aside from, well, salt! It is not always quite as effective as other antiperspirants / deodorants, but it&#x27;s usually more than good enough on a daily basis, provided you don&#x27;t sweat more than the average person.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping for an alternative to the aluminum based ones normally used.  It worked fine for wintertime when I only had desk work to do.  However, with any amount of activity I found myself needing a deodorant.  I ended up throwing the stone away in search of something different.</li>
    <li> Product works very well &amp; lasts a long time, making it well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!! I&#x27;m a mitchum user and I have to switch up on deodorants for effectiveness but even that was not working for me anymore, I heard about this stone and thought \\&quot;yeah right\\&quot; BUT I gave it a try and IM SO HOOKED! This absolutely works miracles, the last reviewer is right when it comes to applying this apply it to the arm above and below which is in contact with the underarm is the secret. One stone lasts a year or more I still have mine from last year, talk about saving $$$! I constantly rave about this stone I should be a representative for this product lol    Another thing I tried was this...I have lost a bunch of weight but prior to losing weight (being heavy) my legs had no space between them so I would perspire more inside the crease of my legs (gross!) Anyway I gave this a try there as well and I DONT ANYMORE! No smell there anymore either. I&#x27;m also very large breasted as well and perspire under my breasts too, I use the stone there too and if there is ANY SMELL caused by perspiring its COMPLETELY GONE with this stone. You dont smell the stone (which has no fragrance) or yourself AT ALL, God, I just love this thing! If only I had bought this sooner but my skepticism gets the best of me, mostly because of false promises but this stone doesnt make those thats for sure lol All natural, lasts for over a year, saves money, works amazingly and I use it for multiple purposes in the perspiration dept. I&#x27;ll never use anything else but this stone it should be in every store, but I betcha its too effective and would put all anti perspirants and deodorant companies out of business if it was, you wont regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> Product works as described. Works all day long without any staining or damaging residue. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used crystal stone deodorants before with success but this one just didn&#x27;t work at all! A shame because it has such high ratings and i was really hoping it would work.</li>
    <li> I love my Thai Deodorant, it works and lasts a long time,it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using the thai stone for some time and it works great.  A while back I switched to the spray and then tried the roller.  They both work great.  I ordered the stone this time and with in a few weeks was reminded why I switched to the spray.  The stone is very brittle and will shatter if dropped.  The stone gets slippery when you wet it so it is easy to drop.  I was able to savage most of the stone by flipping it over.  I would give it five star if it did break so easily.  I would recommend the spray or roller if you are clumsy like me. ;)</li>
    <li> Like many who&#x27;ve come before me, I must sing the praises of the little stone that put me in the zone!  The &#x27;safe to stand next to hot chicks in a crowded elevator zone,&#x27; that is.  No joke, this product works.  Here&#x27;s the trick though - use some bad-ass soap like Dial antibacterial (white), and scrub your pits like a champ &#x27;til you&#x27;ve annihilated all traces of funk.  Then, apply this here salt of Zeus LIBERALLY, like for at least 20 seconds per pit.  You do that, Funk Fighters, and you&#x27;re good to go!    Oh yeah, like another reviewer said, don&#x27;t drop it.  Not only is it a sin, but it will shatter, like your dreams of freshness achieved.    Disclaimer: Some of you may be genetically predisposed to sweat like a mofo, and no amount of salt is gonna do you justice.  If that is your fate, then bite the bullet, and spring for some industrial strength stuff.  Just don&#x27;t hate on the stone; blame mom &amp; dad.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic until I tried it.  My husband and I were both amazed at how well it works without the chemicals of traditional deodorant.</li>
    <li> I am a young female with horrible BO!! .... Embarrassing but true. I was very skeptical about this product. However, after a day sweat-filled fun in the sun and NOT A HINT of BO I am impressed!! It works!! Try it .... you will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> On the first couple days of using this it did not seem that effective. I gave it a chance though and after a few days it seemed to work a lot better. I did what other reviewers recommended and applied it liberally to my armpit and surrounding area. I really have no idea why it would work better after a few days of use but my best guess is that the skin just has to become acclimated to it and the mineral substance most likely builds up from multiple uses making it more effective.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff!  Dries super fast, no odor ever, no staining of clothes.  Just wonderful and it seems it will last a very long time.  The first time I used it, I kind of went overboard rubbing that smooth cold stone around my pits, it feel very soothing.  I had some mild itching that day.  The next day and every day since, I&#x27;ve used it more reasonably and I&#x27;ve had no itching whatsoever.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Thus works perfectly for me. My main reason for buying was because other deodorants stain my under shirts. I was concerned that this would not stop body odor but it does. I&#x27;ve even gone 36 hours with it and even done yard work and no sweat smell. Some of those that say it doesn&#x27;t work may not be applying enough.</li>
    <li> A great product my last one lasted more than 2 years.  I use it every night  after my shower before bed.  It works all day long I have gotten four sticks  for other family members who are trying them now.</li>
    <li> The crystal deodorant worked amazingly for a week or two, but then I started to get stinky very quickly.    *sigh* I was so hopeful that a natural deodorant would work for me, but my quest still continues.</li>
    <li> I bought one and used it-that day I couldn&#x27;t hardly believe the results for it felt like I had nothing on my armpits at all and by the end of the day my armpits didn&#x27;t smell a bit. I figured it was a fluke since I didn&#x27;t really physically exert myself that day and didn&#x27;t have the objective feedback of anyone else (as if I would really want to ask someone to smell my armpits. lol). The next day I had to really test it to see if it was too good to be true. So I went on my long hike with the temp around 80-90 degrees. After I get home from those hikes I can always unquestionably smell the body odor from my armpits. I couldn&#x27;t believe it-my armpits did not smell bad at all! I still couldn&#x27;t believe it so I kept \\&quot;testing\\&quot; it and it really works! In my personal opinion it&#x27;s one of those rare products that almost seem too good to be true! I feel it delivers way more than promised and extra has benefits such as it&#x27;s cheap and no gunk, won&#x27;t stain shirts, perfect for travel, etc... Now my only concern is that they never stop making this product!</li>
    <li> great product, have used for years</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 8 years...works BETTER than any &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; I used for the prior 40 years. And I&#x27;m still using the same bar...Just remember to always apply to clean arm pits. I can go two - three if I have to - days without reapplying. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but none as effective as this product.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been very disappointed by this deodorant stone. For me, it completely fails to perform its advertised task. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much time I spend slathering it around in my nether-regions; I smell horrible. I had just run out of my conventional deodorant, and put my entire faith in this magical Thai crystal as I endured one stinking week waiting for it to arrive. Oh well, maybe I can find some other uses for it. Definitely gonna have to 1-star this one. What a shame.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended getting one of these stones.  After a few months and letting my other products be used up I finally got one.  I wish I had moved earlier and just thrown away the other products.  The Thai crystal stone is an amazing product and I have greatly enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> We have been using this for at least a year now. My son gets really bad, red, raised, itchy rashes from regular deodorant so we decided to give this a try. Now several of us use it! It really does work. I love knowing that my kids (and I) aren&#x27;t applying all those weird ingredients. It has always arrived quickly and well-packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you have to know what you&#x27;re getting. Maybe our experience will help if you&#x27;re trying to decide. No, it is not an antiperspirant. Yes, you will get wet since it is applied wet. Neither of these things bother me at all. Applying liberally in the morning and evening is best. If I&#x27;m doing a hard workout or will be very active, I use regular deodorant, or plan on showering or washing up immediately afterward and reapplying. This is a natural solution, so you can&#x27;t expect it to work like an antiperspirant. However, if you make a few adjustments and have the right expectations, this a wonderful natural solution.</li>
    <li> Arm pits stink like stinky arm pits!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several scented \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants and all of them left a red rash under my arm.  Plus, the scent would often fade away during the day and the stink would return, meaning I&#x27;d have to reapply. I was skeptical when I read about this product, but with all the good reviews I figured what could I lose beyond $8?  Besides, several people noted how the product lasted a year, so if it lasted, I figured, I&#x27;d be an even bigger winner.  Well, it&#x27;s been at least three weeks since I&#x27;ve had this product ... and I have not smelled stinky ONCE since using it, even after working out.  Yes, I still sweat when working out, I do not have any foul odors at all.  And I apply only once a day after my shower. I&#x27;m amazed. Also, I can&#x27;t tell that the stick has gone down any since using it, so it&#x27;s certainly lasting much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve ever owned. For me, this has been a great purchase and I would highly recommend it. The most you have to lose is $8 or so ... but the potential gain is so much greater.</li>
    <li> I discovered this a few years ago when I got worried about aluminum in brand name deoderants -- now I use Thai stone after each (daily) shower. The stone lasts nearly a year, so it&#x27;s cost effective as well as keeping me odor-free. Just don&#x27;t panic if it takes a week or so of applications to get rid of the oder-causing bacteria that supermarket store deoderants just cover up  - once you get through that initial intro, Thai stone works perfectly... so glad I found this initially in my health food store...[[ASIN:0823033112 Oil Pastel for the Serious Beginner: Basic Lessons in Becoming a Good Painter]]. PS - I now live in South Florida, with no air conditioning - so in summer I just take a shower morning &amp; night. Thai stone never fails me even in sweltering heat!</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day. It doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration, you need to know that. What it does is create an environment in which the odor causing bacteria will not thrive. Yup, that&#x27;s your pits and they can get pretty skanky with all those germs feeding under your arms but that&#x27;s enough of that! You have to get this wet and apply it rather liberally and not just the area with hair (for those of us who don&#x27;t shave there). I have to wet it at least once per arm and it works best if you start in small concentric circles, moving outward. You can go ahead and put clothing on even though your underarms are still wet - it won&#x27;t stain and it won&#x27;t hinder the odor protection. I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for about three years. The first one I had was not in the plastic handle and one morning it slipped out of my hand (it was wet!) and it shattered. This one is easier to hold on to. After some time it will feel loose in the plastic but I&#x27;ve not had any indication it&#x27;s going to come out. I guess I have been using this about 7 months now. Should get about a year and a half out of it the way it&#x27;s going.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same Thai crystal deodorant stick everyday (sometimes twice a day) for almost ten years and at the current rate, will have it for at least another 5 years. That&#x27;s a lot of money saved and plastic containers I don&#x27;t have to buy and dispose of. I work outdoors in the heat and humidity of the south and I sweat heavily. During those occasions (camping) when I am unable to shower daily, the Thai crystal keeps on working.  It is simply the most effective, safest deodorant I have ever used. This one was purchased for my son. I expect he will have it for many years if he doesn&#x27;t loose it.</li>
    <li> The best.   Forgot to mention: the glued-on paper over the case was totally annoying and frustrating to remove. Very troublesome.</li>
    <li> I find it hard to believe that something so harmless sounding could keep me odor-free all day long whereas every other roll-on product without aluminum or parabens have failed to do the same.  For example Trader Joe&#x27;s all natural product left me stink after only four hours or so.    Anyway, considering this product will last as long as half a dozen deodorant sticks, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  Really, you won&#x27;t believe how effective this simple product is.  And for folks like me with extremely sensitive underarm skin, it&#x27;s a godsend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an extremely skeptical person, but this stuff works.  I&#x27;m a very active 27 y/o guy and have had no BO since using this crystal.  The key is to put it on immediately after every shower when your armpit is still wet and put it ALL over you armpit and the surrounding area.  I sometimes use it in conjunction with a deodorant spray for the pine smell and double coverage.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and have had no issues.  Keep in mind, this is not an antiperspirant, so you&#x27;ll still sweat.  I&#x27;ll deal with the sweat over having itchy, red armpits.</li>
    <li> I was allergic to pretty much every type of deoderant+antiperspirant out there and then I became allergic to Tom&#x27;s deoderant sticks. This is my last option. I was reluctant at first since I like all modern consumers, tend to believe that if it doesn&#x27;t have enough chemicals in it, it probably doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this Thai deoderant crystal work, it works perfectly for preventing odors for more than a day. It feels like I am not wearing anything at all, and it never stains clothes. It will last me a long time, making it cheaper than any deoderant on the market. It is also very sturdy- I just dropped it on my kitchen floor on accident and it is still intact. It&#x27;s made with natural salts that prevent bacteria from growing in the first place, not that gross glue and harsh fragrances that try to \\&quot;stop it up\\&quot; and cover it up like traditional deoderants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no allergic reactions to this stone and no odor problems like I was worried about. Be sure to wet the stone before applying and apply generously. This is not an antipersperant- so if you are so repulsed by your body&#x27;s natural self-cooling perspiration system, then by all means use glue, aluminum, and petro-based chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I can use.  I am allergic to everything else.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> BE CARFULL WHEN BUYING,I PAID FOR A 2 PACK AND ONLY RECIEVED 1.I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT THEM TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO FIX IT BUT SINCE THEY ALREADY GOT THEIR MONEY THEY DON&#x27;T CARE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.SO BE CAREFULL WHEN BUYING YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR.YOUR&#x27;S TRULEY RIPPED OFF AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have tried a ton of natural and organic products and they just didn&#x27;t work. This actually works! I don&#x27;t understand because it&#x27;s just a solid cylinder block of salt but it works! You have to run it under water for a second to get it wet and then apply it to your armpit. It drys pretty instantly. Worth the $7!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for weeks now.  I have been working in my garden and perspiring and this product works!  I do cover all areas surrounding my armpit - including my biceps which come in contact with the \\&quot;pit\\&quot; area.  I skipped a day - the Thai stick still kept me odor free but this was not a day working outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend soap and water cleaning daily but I am happy to no longer need a commercially made deodorant.  I purchased an additional stick for my husband but he has not used it yet so I don&#x27;t have a manly recommendation except that he has had to be the \\&quot;smeller of the pits\\&quot; and agrees that it works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant stone! I was so sick of wearing deodorant that balls up into little clumps throughout the day. Moreover, by the end of the day my arms would smell like a mixture of flowers and straight mustiness!!! Not anymore! This rock works! I have been wearing it over a month now through crazy Texas heat and heavy workouts (I sweat a lot) and I have not gotten musty. I tell people about it. Give it a try. I could possibly go two days without reapplying the stone but in my paranoia I apply it anyway.  You smell like yourself. Not like fake flowers and lilies. My underarms smell clean, even after a workout. No mustiness,no disgusting deodorant crumble balls and no fake nauseating manufactured scent!! This rock truly Rocks!!!!</li>
    <li> All the positive reviews prompted me to go back and give this another try before reviewing, but my results were the same even with more liberal application.  You have to value the all-natural concept pretty highly to have the patience for what I found to be a rather messy application process--rewetting the stick multiple times and covering a wide area--compared to the quick swipes of an ordinary dry grocery aisle deodorant.  I do value natural products, which is what led me to try this, but I guess it just doesn&#x27;t work for everyone regardless of dedication to proper application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;d forgotten that perspiration can be pretty odoriferous since my regular use of Secret or another such product work well for me even when I&#x27;m working hard outside in summer.  Well, this is winter and I&#x27;m not working hard, so I was surprised at the not-so-pleasant results when using this product.  I can&#x27;t say if it helped with wetness because I&#x27;m not doing anything much worthy of that, but I can say that it had no effect on controlling odor even with mild activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the natural aspect is really important to you, it&#x27;s probably worth a try since based on other reviews apparently it&#x27;s worked well for others, but it&#x27;s not effective for everyone.</li>
    <li> I really hoped it would work, but I would put it on in the morning like regular deodorant and it wouldn&#x27;t work. I wore it for almost a week and it never worked. Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> When I first opened I noticed it didn&#x27;t look like the image provided which worried me a bit, but after trying it out that isn&#x27;t a big deal anymore. It truly meets all it&#x27;s advertised promises: Unscented, no greasy feeling, does not stain clothes, and though it did not mention this, I do notice that I sweat less during my daily activities. I have not tried any rigorous exersize with it though. One thing to remember: apply liberally.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product because I thought that it was safe.  Well, I did some research into it and found that this is aluminum in it&#x27;s truest form.  I was quite surprised to learn that this product is aluminum under a different name.  This is bauxite and bauxite is the raw state of aluminum.  Since that is so, we are still using aluminum.  I emailed the company almost a month ago and have not heard a thing from them.  I wish I had known sooner.    Update:  Dr. Mercola had this review 2-16-2010.  [...]  And I still have not heard from the company about this issue.</li>
    <li> This is basically the same product as the \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; brand (also sold on Amazon). Both are just cylinders of alum salt with a plastic housing around it. But this one&#x27;s plastic housing is much better designed, which makes all the difference.  With the \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; brand, the salt stick is loose inside a cylindrical plastic sleeve. This causes two problems:  1) When you wet the salt stick before using it (you have to do that), the water fills up inside the plastic cylinder so that when you turn it on its side to apply it, water dribbles out all over your chest and/or legs. Not good.  2) Since the salt stick is loose inside the plastic cylinder with that brand, when you turn it on its side to apply it, the salt can fall out if you&#x27;re not careful. And if it falls to the floor, the salt will shatter. That happened to both me and my wife.  With the \\&quot;Thai\\&quot; brand, the salt stick is attached to a plastic base. When you remove the cover, all that&#x27;s left is an exposed stick of salt stuck to a base. This solves both problems above. There is no plastic sleeve to trap water (the cyliner/sleeve is part of the cap, which comes off when you&#x27;re doing the wetting and applying), and the salt stick is actually attached to the base so it won&#x27;t fall to the floor when you turn it on its side.  So get the \\&quot;Thai\\&quot; brand instead of the \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; brand.</li>
    <li> Works well on order. Knowing how much your actually putting on can cause issues, too much and it can (even severely) irritate your skin, not enough and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. The rock lasts for a good bit, application gets more difficult as the crystal wears down.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for many years</li>
    <li> I bought this for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I wanted a deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t leave substantial residue on my clothes. In this, this crystal is a success. If you&#x27;re a fan of speed stick &amp;#34;invisible solids&amp;#34; like I am, this alternative is much less harsh on your clothes. You can apply it liberally and it won&#x27;t wind up deposited all over the pits of your shirts which is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I wanted a deodorant that would last longer than the power-stripe speed sticks that I usually use. This crystal also excells here. You can probably make one of them last for over a year if you use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t clog my lymph nodes. If you&#x27;re familiar with invisible solids, you know that putting them on can clog the lymph nodes in your armpits, resulting in discomfort and even pain in some circumstances. This product is completely exempt from this tenancy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons. You need water or sweat to activate this before applying to your underarms. Not a big deal, but instead of being pasty like an invisible solid, or goopy like a gel, this gets STICKY. Its a really gross feeling and I dislike it. You have two options here, use enough water to get the activation you need, but fight through the sticky grossness, or don&#x27;t use much water, but get subpar application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. So you&#x27;re still going to sweat if you live somewhere warm. Your armpits won&#x27;t stink, but you&#x27;re still going to do a lot of underarm sweating. This was a problem for me, as I live in Texas. I still wound up with pit stains during the day, even if I did avoid any unpleasant odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the effects of the deodorant are hard to measure, and minimal if you live somewhere warm, or tend to sweat under the arms a lot. For example, I&#x27;ll put it on in the morning, and by 1PM the effects have warn off and I can smell my underarms and tell that it isn&#x27;t working. Where as with a regular deodorant that typically gets more effective when you sweat. Sometimes you&#x27;re just not sure that this is effectively blocking odor until you come to the embarrassing realization that it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re only prone to minimal underarm perspiration or if you live in a cold environment. But if you&#x27;re active, live somewhere warm, or just do a lot of sweating, I can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> i purchased this and when i opened it for the first time and smelled it, it already smelled like armpit lol. weird i know...&lt;br /&gt;it works ok as long as its not a hot day, but if its hot....boy do i STANK!</li>
    <li> Some background:&lt;br /&gt;Had this for just about a year now and I use it quite a bit.  I bought these because I get rashes when I use regular deodorant sticks whether they be commercial brands, Tom&#x27;s, or other organic brands.  I have sensitive skin and it is a pain in the @ss.  Luckily I don&#x27;t sweat profusely or smell too bad.  I can run a mile plus without severe sweat marks on my back and just a little in pit area.  I would say I am just an average sweater.  (Weirdest review I&#x27;ve written so far)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in an office most days and sometimes out in the &amp;#34;field&amp;#34; doing more rigorous work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No rashes&lt;br /&gt;No itchiness&lt;br /&gt;Moderate effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;-4 hours before reapplying when being a couch potato or paper pusher&lt;br /&gt;-2 hours if doing something strenuous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not for heavy sweaters&lt;br /&gt;Not if you have a strong mustiness&lt;br /&gt;Reapplication is needed even if sitting at your desk&lt;br /&gt;After heavy use stick rattles because of wear&lt;br /&gt;Bits and pieces fall if dropped and if too wet it will crumble over time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;It works alright for my use since I don&#x27;t do heavy lifting all day everyday.  But if I have a meeting with the boss or have a presentation I&#x27;ll still use a commercial brand deodorant to ensure fresh smell.</li>
    <li> excellent product! going to give them to our children and adults for stocking stuffers at Christmas. Works like a champ!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this rock.    It&#x27;s amazing what natural salt minerals can do for you.    So I&#x27;ve been trying to find organic deodorant.  I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine, except it ended up peeling some of my skin (and it wasn&#x27;t really organic)  I was going to try arm and hammer, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;natural\\&quot; either.      So I decided to give this a go, and the results are fantastic!  Just run it over with water from the facet, and apply generously. It works like magic. I&#x27;ve also been told it lasts for a few years, so the price is worth it.     pros:  Everything.    It&#x27;s good for you.    The only cons I can think of are:   1. when you start sweating excessively, you need to re-apply.  2. it&#x27;s not as convenient as other deodorant. (you need water)    All it all, it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
    <li> Works great and I love it! I recommend using it 2 times a day at first. Once in the morning, and one in the evening. When first putting it on I recommend taking a shower and scrubbing down all old deoderont residue, dry... and then apply. For guys I recommend trimming down the arm pit hair and keeping it short so you are apply to apply it better. I noticed once I did this the product got on my skin better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one note: It was working great till it slipped out of my hand and hit the ceramic tile floor resulting in an explosion of salt. It literally looked like I just poured salt all over the floor. Wish it had more of a better grip rather than the small base at the bottom. Remember you have to wet it... so water is going to be prone to getting on your hands and making it slip out. Wish the base was larger to hold on too or better yet if it can be twisted and expose a little at a time opposed to the entire crystal rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it and love it!</li>
    <li> So one day after reading regarding the health concerns about antiperspirants I decided to find a different solution. A few months after trying all natural products out there, I accidentally stumbled across this one. Wow, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This product actually starts to work if you use it consistently. It basically suppresses the growth of the bacteria that produces the odors. It&#x27;s not a cover up, like other products - it gets right to the root of the issue. After about 2 weeks of using it, it&#x27;s perfect. No mess, no odors! Apply generously!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 4 years!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in good condition. Just as described. I was super skeptical but after throwing away another workout shirt I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. The other antiperspirant or deodorants didn&#x27;t seems to work after a little while or at all for me. I also read some of the ingredients and figured I could do without slathering some of them on my lymph nodes. So far I have tried this brand and crystal brand I found at a grocery store. I used this one for a month during which time I worked hard outside setting up new raised beds and filling them with compost from across the yard or weeding for hours or working out... You get the idea. No smell but lots of sweat. In fact it was so surprising my spouse started to use it. It is now his. I would suggest using after showering or at least wiping off well before applying. Tried to just put on after woke up without and could smell a little but still not much. I use the tip and sides and like suggested before spread it around about 2-3 inches away from hair line just to be sure. Just put it under running water for a second and apply. Rewet as needed and then get dressed. We leave the lid off so it can dry. Seems to work better than the crystal but not sure why if they are the same ingredients. I am a believer and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have always used the clinical strength deodorant until receiving this stick. It works great for both my husband and myself.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like perfumed deodorant, and are conscious of the aluminum issues with normal deodorant products, you will find this product worth your while.  Absolutely no odor problems at all using this product. I am 56 years old, and still work for a living and odor was controlled up to 3 days without a second application, during my testing and evaluation period.  I now use it regularly and have replaced all my previous products with Thai Crystal. Yes I am very surprised at how well it works.</li>
    <li> I use this salt stone, just wet and apply...as simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;No chemicals and surprisingly no odor from 6am-10pm.  Time and time again, I am floored at how a simple deodorant like this can be so powerful while not causing any toxicity in our systems.  I can not say enough about this one product.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this product a try because it was hypo-allergic. I still don&#x27;t know how to figure out if it even works. It&#x27;s a crystal stick that you wet and apply under your arm. It&#x27;s suppose to keep you dry, but that didn&#x27;t happen for me. It may work for others, but I ended up switching back to my normal brand. If you are looking for an organic deodorant,you may want to look into other options.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend discovered this product, because she is not a fan of the chemicals in deodorants and antiperspirants, and gave me one of the extras that she bought for friends.  I sweat a lot, and have used antiperspirants (AP from hereon, because I&#x27;m tired of typing that!) all my life, and the Thai Deodorant Stick has made me realize that AP, for me at least, is a farce.  Even when using AP, I still sweat a lot, and still developed a funk sometimes.  I&#x27;ve used this stick for more than a week, and it&#x27;s amazing.  I still sweat - no more and no less than when using an AP - but there&#x27;s no funky underarm odor.  I&#x27;m well beyond satisfied with this product and can&#x27;t imagine that I would ever go back to AP.  I haven&#x27;t dropped mine, but I read lots of comments that it can shatter if you drop it - so be careful.  Even if I did drop it and it shattered, I&#x27;d immediately buy another one.  Do the math - AP costs $3.50-$5.00 and lasts about a month.  This product costs twice that, lasts 10+ times longer AND is more effective.  So, I&#x27;ll be buying a second one to keep on hand in case my first one does break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m betting the shirt staining issue will be gone for good for my newer shirts, and that hopefully those with stains already will get better now that I won&#x27;t be coating them in chemical-laden sweat.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in some form for 4 years now. I went to my local natural grocery store in desperation one day 4 years ago after regular deodorants, which always failed me by the end of the day anyway, resulted in welts under my arms. I react to perfumes over time, and even though I was using natural deodorants with no perfume, I was beginning to break out even when I changed products. The natural grocery store employee saw me looking at all their deodorants in desperation, and when I explained what my problem was, she handed me the Thai Crystals in spray form. Within 2 days, I was experiencing no rash and no odor, and it&#x27;s been that way ever since. And I live in a town, Austin, Texas, where you sweat a lot throughout the year. I finally decided to switch to the stone 1.5 years ago because the spray is expensive and I was going through it fast. I am still on the same stone with what looks like another year to go! I apply it in the morning, and I never experience any odor. I notice that some people have said that it fails them over time, but I assure you that is not the case for everyone. Thai crystals were a lifesaver for me!</li>
    <li> This product works very well and I am a very active guy. I usually run two to three miles a day (five to six times a week). And I also do boxing twice a week. I usually apply the deodorant for 30 to 40 seconds under each arm and it works all day including my workouts. A few times it did lose its effectiveness but that only occurred when I didn&#x27;t apply enough. I would highly recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t have all those chemicals especially if you are person worried about what goes on and into your body.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter and she seems very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My pediatrican recommended that I get this for my daughter since regular deodorant isn&#x27;t healthy for kids. And honestly it works great. Works pretty great! I am now using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this, just to try it out, haven&#x27;t had any luck with my usual go to deoderant (Dove) so I decided to try this, I showered, put it on and it lasted over a day and a half with no issues what so ever.  I put it on every day now and never have any smell or wetness issus and it has no harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> So... my man card is made out of fricken steel lined titanium.  I work as an electrician and I&#x27;m always on the move. Some days I prefer to kill terrorists with just my bare hands while riding velociraptors. You know why? Cause I&#x27;m an &#x27;Merican, that&#x27;s why!  Needless to say, my pits stink.  Do I care?  Hell no!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the ladies seem too!  Yup, they swoon over my huge biceps, but once I raise these beast slayers, the ladies run out of fear of a Syrian gas attack fumigating the air around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have a sensitive side... my skin.  I&#x27;m like a vampire at a tanning salon that&#x27;s located in a green house.  I&#x27;ve even tried that bee keepers dudes deodorant and that tree hugging Tom guys woodland musk deodorant. Both gave me a rash like that time I... never mind.  You don&#x27;t want to know. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this has pink on the label. First strike against it right there in my book, but I gave it a shot anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked. It worked like a charm. MY PITS DON&#x27;T STINK AT ALL.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they still sweat like somebody turned on a garden hose, but they don&#x27;t stink. This is a deodorant stink, not antiperspirant right! Oh, you got to rub this stuff on generously.  Don&#x27;t be shy with it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used camouflage duct tape to cover up the pink.  I call it my man rock now.</li>
    <li> I never liked the smell of most deodorants, and for some reason finding an unscented deodorant is nearly impossible.  And then there&#x27;s the idea that aluminum chemicals are seeping into my body and slowly eating away at my brain.  So, I decided to give the crystal deodorant a try, and I found Thai Crystal on Amazon with pretty strong reviews.    I have been using the crystal now for about two months and it is amazing!  There is no residue so I don&#x27;t have to worry about white streaks on my clothing.  And best of all, there is no smell!  None!  Not of my body or of the deodorant!  I used this deodorant for a week in Vegas during the the peak heat of summer and only barely would start to smell myself at the end of the day.  And even then, it wasn&#x27;t the gross combo of old deodorant and sweat, it was just my sweat.  It costs a bit more than other deodorants, but it lasts way longer so in the end you are definitely paying less.    Some of the other comments here were very helpful to me.  I make sure to clean my underarms well in the shower, and I apply it liberally as soon as I get out.  It dries within a minute of putting it on.  I&#x27;ve even applied it at night before bed and then gone the entire next day without smelling.    So basically if you want to avoid harmful chemicals, save money and smell like a clean human instead of giving off a manufactured \\&quot;shower fresh\\&quot; aroma, you should try this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slowly converting my family to a more natural and healthy lifestyle. This product is great. The Thai deodorant stone is natural, lasts a long time and works great. The service and delivery was spot on. I will continue to buy this product for myself and my family.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;No scent. No residue. No body odor.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This is a life saver for hot summer sandal season in Arizona.  I&#x27;ve found it is much more effective on the feet than in the arm pits though!  I&#x27;ve even taken it in to my yoga class and mentioned it to the class as a whole (there are some who needs its deodorizing power).  One can only hope they take the hint!</li>
    <li> I look for aluminum free &amp; a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t suppress perspiration. That is why I like this product. The last one I bought lasted 3 years.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant of all times! This hidden gem is a product that most people don&#x27;t know about.  So easy to use, and one deodorant crystal last so long!  Also, gone are the days of your deodorant melting on a warm day.  Just apply water to the stone and apply to the underarms.  Your pits will be dry within moments and you can go about the rest of your day without worrying about smelling or even worse, deodorant stains on your clothing.  Highly recommend to all!</li>
    <li> This product works great as long as you&#x27;re not planning to use it during your workouts.  For everyday use this product never fails and I found it to last anywhere from 8 to 12 hours.  So far have been using for over 2 month with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as soon as any extra physical activity (like a workout or working in your yard) this product fails fairly quickly and once you try to reapply it the stick itself will pickup the smell and then will have a smell for at least a couple of weeks. This does not affect the product performance just the thing will stink for a while.</li>
    <li> No smell, no mess, and works great. Wish I had it before instead of all the big name deodorants.</li>
    <li> If you want a deodorant that works very well, saves a lot of money, and is much better for the environment and you, I strongly recommend the Thai Deodorant Stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that it is primarily a deodorant and not that good an antiperspirant. If you need an excellent antiperspirant, use something else. However most people do not need a high powered antiperspirant every day. For instance, if I&#x27;m headed into a situation where it is critical that I stay dry (like a tense presentation in front of many people under hot lights), then yes I still use a strong antiperspirant such as Dry Idea Roll On. However 99% of the time (even for most presentations -- and I give a lot of presentations) a good deodorant is all I need every day. Plus sweating is a good thing. It keeps you cooler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the Thai Deodorant Stone effectively, it is best to wash your armpits thoroughly, rinse just the top of the stick briefly to wet it (leave the sides dry), rub it back and forth on your underarms to cover them thoroughly, rinse just the top again, then leave it out to dry (which allows a bit of crystal to recrystalize lower down and provide a slip free rough grip for when the crystal is no longer held by the base -- it will eventually work itself loose). This takes a little more time than typical liquid underarm deodorants/antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saves money: The more powerful antiperspirants usually work well as both deodorants and antiperspirants and cost about $5 for 3.25 ounces (good for about a month of use). That&#x27;s about $60/year per person. Whereas a $7 Thai Stone (4.25 ounces) will last about 1 year (based on my use) for only $7/year per person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less waste: almost all of the Thai Stone is product you use -- it is a solid mineral crystal -- so there is little waste afterwards, just the cover and the base. Other deodorants leave you with many more containers made of much more plastic as a waste product in the end. If the manufacturer would pack this same cylindrical stick in a plain recyclable cardboard box then there would be zero plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fewer allergy problems: more people seem to react to aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex (or pentachlorohydrex), or the long list of other chemicals that are in other commercial deodorants. The deodorant stone is pure Alum (Ammonium Alum - Ammonium aluminium sulfate - (NH4)Al(SO4)2·12H2O ) and seems to cause many fewer problems. Please note that yes Alum contains aluminum but much less than the other deodorant compounds and in a form that is neutral and does not seem to cause any allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less damage to clothing: the Thai Stone is a water soluble salt that does NOT leave stains. Other deodorants often leave stains behind after repeated use. Some others may leave white marks. I know this from long term use of a number of others -- the armpits of many of my shirts and t-shirts were trashed by other deodorants but this has stopped since using the deodorant stone (since 2010 now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially infinite shelf life: As long as it is kept dry and out of the elements, the deodorant stone crystal should keep essentially forever -- it is just a rock crystal. Stones last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveats: The crystal in the Thai Stone can chip/crack if dropped on a hard surface. If it breaks, the resulting hard edges may discourage use. Since the stick lasts so long, this risk of breakage may be significant for some.a plain recyclable cardboard box then there would be zero plastic.

    <li> I have to admit I didn&#x27;t think this thing would actually work, but it does! I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and my armpits are funk free. Sometimes on hot days when I&#x27;m very active outdoors I sweat, but it never smells. The first day I used it I kept checking to make sure I didn&#x27;t smell, I was nervous, but I had nothing to worry about. When I used regular deodorants with antiperspirants I used to wake up and my armpits would smell, but with this it truly lasts at least 24 hours. I never smell, and it even works on my man. His old deodorant always failed after a 12 hr shift and he would come home stinkin&#x27;. But not anymore with the crystal deodorant. Thank goodness! Hopefully it will continue to work as well in the summer, but I have confidence that it will. Also, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and the crystal is still the same size! I can&#x27;t wait to see how long it lasts, it seems to pay for itself compared to buying a stick of deodorant every 2 months. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I feel so stupid.  I&#x27;ve used the chemical laden, generally inadequate, heavily promoted deodorants for my whole life.  I usually try to get off of the beaten path and not follow the trends, but I certainly failed in this area.  Until now, that is. (I prefer to drink upstream, rather than downstream of the herd.)  This really does work, and for days at a time, if that becomes necessary.  It has NO odor, and it prevents underarm odors from developing.  It seems to be almost magical.  An honest product, that really works, at a bargain price.  Use only after bathing.  Don&#x27;t try to use it as a cover-up for odors already present.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years now. No chemicals, yet this works as an excellent deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I am going through hot flashes a lot of the time and this cuts my older down by at least 50%. That says a lot for me.</li>
    <li> I think that this product is great. I really didn&#x27;t think that it would work but it does. The trick is to put it all over the under arm not just where the hair grows. You need to go lower down the side and higher up the arm. Form a large circle and wet it twice if you need to. My friend was disappointed with hers until I made these suggestions then she was quite amazed and it doesn&#x27;t stain as far as I know. So put it on liberally and don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s only salt. I did a test and mine lasted two and three days most of the time. &lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you&#x27;re going on a date, a wedding or something really important you might feel more comfortable with the old stand-by but for everyday use and to stay away from the chemicals this is great.</li>
    <li> For years I have struggled with finding a deodorant or antiperspirant that was both effective AND wouldn&#x27;t give me a burning rash in my armpits. I usually had so settle for mild versions that were not the best at fighting odors. This Rock Salt Thai Crystal Deodorant Stone has been wonderful--much better odor protection than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, and absolutely no rash or other side effects. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Now an official fan.  I took a break from using went to Tom&#x27;s and other chemically produced deodorants.  Circle back to this. No smell, keeps me from smelling, no chemicals and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a number of natural deodorants for more than 2 years. Some have worked (to an extent) and some have not worked at all.  I have also tried to get my husband to stop using harmful deodorants with aluminum. He has tried some of the natural deodorants, some of which didn&#x27;t work at all, and some gave him a rash on his very sensitive skin.  When he wanted to try the Thai Crystal I was very skeptical, thinking that it just wouldn&#x27;t work. We both tried it and have been using it for a 2 weeks now. We are both positively thrilled at how well it works!!   I have put it through the test (mowing the grass in 90 plus degrees in Alabama!) and when other deodorants would have stopped working, this one still kept me odor-free! I also went 2 days without a shower and it was STILL working!  My husband is very pleased with the results as well. He says that this is working even way after his other deodorant would have stopped AND the best part is that it has NOT irritated his sensitive skin at all!  I highly recommend this deodorant for anyone, especially people with very sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> My mom always used these rock salt crystal deodorant sticks when I was growing up but I never did when I got older b/c I tried them once and they didn&#x27;t work. Well obviously I was doing something wrong, b/c this thing works great for me now. I recently developed very stinky underarms towards the end of my work day no matter what brand of anti-perspirant I was using. It was grossing me out! So my mom convinced me to try the crystal deodorant again and showed me exactly how to use it. It needs to be applied on the entire under surface area under your arms, not just the area where you shave to work really well. This is the brand I chose and I just love it! I still smell fresh at the end of the day and usually the next day too! If I feel like I&#x27;m sweating to much or don&#x27;t like the feeling of sweat under my arms, I just pat a little bit of corn starch into my underarms and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> Cheap and delivered as expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slightly devastated because I thought this was the answer to my prayers!  I was so excited to try a deodorant without aluminum, especially in as awesome of a form as a crystal rock.  For some reason, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I read all the reviews, tried all the suggestions out, but it just got to the point where I was sitting there applying this from my upper waist all the way up to my elbow over and over and over, and I finally just had to accept that this isn&#x27;t the thing for me.  I love how it&#x27;s unscented and easy-to-apply - however, I found that my underarms still smelled after the normal course of a day.  Less than they would if I wasn&#x27;t wearing deodorant, to be fair, but much more than when I used regular aluminum-chemical-laden deodorant.  In fact, my boyfriend had to beg me to switch back to my old Secret deodorant before I finally conceded defeat.      Seems like some people love this product, though, so I guess it depends on the person. Just sad to find out it&#x27;s not universal!     As a tip:    Careful if you drop the deodorant - the sucker gets slippery to hold after you are running it under water and the plastic handle part gets wet, etc.  I dropped mine on the floor and the top part cracked and a bunch of pieces broke off - after that, it was like trying to apply glass shards to my underarms.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, my guess was that it at least had to help with odor, but I am totally surprised how well! I gave up using any conventional deodorants, let alone antiperspirants a few years ago for every reason under the sun. I have tried a few of the more natural brands like Tom&#x27;s and Natures Gate sticks, but was never impressed since most of the time the scents would change to something gross throughout the day, whereas my natural scent without actually smells better. I finally just gave up using deodorant entirely during the cooler seasons, because I despise deodorants, everything about them I hate. This is the only brand of crystal deodorant I have tried, but I must say, it is amazing and nothing like traditional deodorants. First of all it actually works. It doesnt clump or feel gooey on your skin, it doesnt get smudges or stains on your clothing and it doesnt have any odor itself. While it doesnt claim to be an antiperspirant, I can tell a difference in the amount of perspiration, although it doesnt feel like it&#x27;s plugging up my skin. It&#x27;s as if the salt it&#x27;s made from is causing the moisture to dry faster. Anyways, im completely sold. The can&#x27;t foresee trying any other deodorant in my future.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable product.  Worth every penny!  No dangerous chemicals, animal fats, carcinogens etc.  Vegan/Vegetarian Safe.  Lasts FOREVER.  I stay completely scent free for days from one application even after showers.  Works equally well for women and men!  No strong artificial scent, only pure natural (aluminum free!) you.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The Thai Crystal is a great natural deoderant. I have been using it for years and it does not leave stains on my clothing. I no longer get those clogged pores under my armpits from using regular deoderants. I really like this product and I also love the Thai Crystal Mist.</li>
    <li> The larger size is excellent and the product works great for me. You do need to apply multiple times per day, not a problem because I shower at least 2x per day. The best part is it will last forever and I don&#x27;t have to worry about ALU collecting in my brain.</li>
    <li> Ok there actually is no sent no perfumes and such, nor is there a sent of your stank :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna try to keep this short...&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this product about a year ago and can honestly tell you that I will never go back to a regular chemical laced deodorant/antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m assuming you know that all those products that go on your skin do get absorbed and get in your system.&lt;br /&gt;Lotions, sun screens, deodorants etc, most aren&#x27;t too healthy to the human body.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line it&#x27;s a great product that works and is great on your wallet since it last much much much&lt;br /&gt;longer than your average deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and one more thing these guys have the best deal on these...believe me I shopped around. :)</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m satisfied about the way that protect me against bad smell. What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that on ingredients states &#x27;mineral salt&#x27;. That&#x27;s it. So, you don&#x27;t know what ingredients are included. Are you sure that all &#x27;mineral salt&#x27; are good for your body? I&#x27;m sorry, but I can not recommended.</li>
    <li> I was sure  about using this. It works great for stopping stinky arm pits. It also says you can use it on your feet. One nice thing is that it last a VERY long time.</li>
    <li> i ordered 2 of this item seen in the picture except it didnt say thai but pure and natural which is the manufacterer of the deodorant stone. You can buy these stones with any labeling you want i think. anyway to the product!    what you basically do with this is you wet the tip with water and then just rub on your arms. you can even rub on your feet! how this works you say....? well the ingredient is pure natural mineral salts which kills the bacteria causing the odor. when you kill those bacteria you won&#x27;t smell the underarm smell.   I used it after i shower and i rub under my armpits one day later. Why....well it&#x27;s fun hahah i haven&#x27;t tested how long it takes for me to have the need to reapply it cause i guess it varies with people.      what&#x27;s so good about this and why you all should buy this is because its natural, there&#x27;s no aluminum like what the deodorants on the store shelves at walmart have, and theres no anti-perspirant which is just a bad idea!!! i mean sweat is the body&#x27;s natural way of getting rid of toxin and cooling the body temperature but i guess we are all vain and fall for the anti-perspirant idea of how it&#x27;s good. well when i used the anti-perspirant, at work i would sweat more than i used to and i found out that if you block the sweating in one area, then expect to find sweating in more embarassing places like forehead and stomach and chest!!!  i highly recommend everyone get this this is like a revolution or something i feel great using this product knowing that it doesn&#x27;t have ingredients that i can&#x27;t even pronounce.     bottom line : get it cause it will last more than 1 year!!!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and I would reccomend it to anyone. Not only does it fight odor it also keeps me comfortably dry! It works better then any deodarant I have bought at the store, and it also lasts in quantity for quite a long time! Therefore not only does it work better then the average deodarant it is also cheaper then the average deodarant in the long run. I honestly believe if you try this product your old deodarant will never be the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this deodorant for a while. When you first use it, it&#x27;s not too effective, but after a week or so, there&#x27;s little to no smell at all! You will still get moist, but you won&#x27;t have an odor. The price could be better, but it&#x27;s competitive.</li>
    <li> the product is very difficult to use. You should wash it well after each use otherwise it smells really bad.</li>
    <li> Miracle product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff WORKS! Its just amazing how well this works. Ever since I started using it I haven&#x27;t gotten any bad odor. I even went 2 days without showering just to test it and it was still working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to apply...I was expecting it to feel harsh against the skin, and I even feared it was going to pull my armpit hair. Yet, thats not how it behaves at all! All you have to do it wet it a little bit and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended.</li>
    <li> These just plain work!  They aren&#x27;t an antiperspirant so you may sweat, but it won&#x27;t smell.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing and so safe!   I think I&#x27;ve had about 3 or four crystal-deoderant stones in my life and I am always impressed.  I particularly  like this one because it&#x27;s in stick form and I can apply it while holding the container.   I am used to the free stone and just using that by itself, but this is so much better.   I recommended to a friend and she is also sold.   It was 105 last summer and after using it, there was never any odor even though I sweated a lot!   Of course, you need to be clean in the first place for it to work, but it definitely works for me.</li>
    <li> Love it. No poisons, no bad things to kill you or your skin. Does not stain clothing and keeps stink away even in the tropics where we live. only bad thing about it and similar brands is it never really lasts for a year as they say.&lt;br /&gt;You need to wet it before application [it is a hard stone after all] and then give it a quick rinse after use under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So water melts it and gathers at bottom - I ended up standing it on its head [with cover] just to drip water out.&lt;br /&gt;Very soon this melting weekend the base and entire stick came off.</li>
    <li> I had my baby in April and my hormones are still in overdrive. This is day 2 and it&#x27;s great. Im excited to use this as an alternative to regular deodorant!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have developed allergies to many deodorants. This on, no problem and works too! This not an anti-presparant, so won&#x27;t stop the sweat. But does work great as deodorant. Wet the stick before applying and apply liberally.</li>
    <li> The product was a solid block of what appeared to be, salt and water. It caused my underarm to get a rash but due to my own body rejecting it or having an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Yes! It works! No more white stains ever. No smell. I had to try it to believe it. And it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> After I stopped using deo with aluminum, I tried switching to this salt stone and stuck to it for several months hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep looking for more aluminum-free deos. But after the first few days, I could swear it was causing me to sweat randomly in my armpits during the day. It was pretty gross. I started developing slight BO too, which I&#x27;ve never had in my life. I think it depends on the person and how their body reacts to it as to your level of success with it.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how well this works. I put it on before I put on another natural deodarant simply because I want a nice smell. Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> This product gives great protection against odor and also leaves no tshirt underarm color.  Excellent product and well worth the price.  It lasts forever.</li>
    <li> In the Summer, I was having issues with having to reapply all the time. If you shave your under arms, I think it helps stay on. If you have little pricklies, it doesn&#x27;t work as well? I figured this out. During Winter, I don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling or anything, but Summer time, when I&#x27;m constantly sweating or in the heat, I did using this product. I give it four stars because I love using it in the Winter, and I love how there aren&#x27;t a lot of chemicals in it. Summer time is the only negative, but that could just be me. My mother-in-law to be told me about this product and she has no issues with it at all, even during Summer. Good buy!!</li>
    <li> Store the stick upside down.  If it&#x27;s stored on its base, the water will trickle down slowly eroding the stone, thus coming loose from the plastic base.  I learned this from the first stone I bought and ended up throwing away a half-used stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stone for years and I&#x27;m still quite happy with it.  I no longer have to constantly purchase white undershirts because of the armpits yellowing.  While this isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, it is a deodorant that eliminates any armpit odor for me.  To deal with sweating, I use something like Drysol at night, which eliminates armpit sweating altogether.  This combination results in dry armpits with no odor, all the time.</li>
    <li> so far it seems ok i have used this in the past and was satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> So i was suffering from irritated darken armpits. unfortunately i inherited my father hygiene  so i sweat a bit more than most (i think) so sometime i even use axe or degree (men deodorant)  to stop all that nastiness. BUT with this MIRACLE DEODORANT i went to the gym, worked out to the max. i got undress to take a shower then realized my armpit doesn&#x27;t stink :O&lt;br /&gt; NO IRRITATION, A BIT SWEAT IF U DO MANUAL WORK BUT OVERALL BETTER THAN THE REGULAR BRAND DEODORANT!!!! BROUGHT 3 MORE! for my family.</li>
    <li> As a personal trainer, sometimes I workout with my clients to demonstrate or to inspire them.  BO is something that is unacceptable.  I wanted something natural and after reading reviews, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, my Thai stick didn&#x27;t work for me when I first started using it.  I could still smell my pits.  However, after applying a little bit more water and covering a greater area, I don&#x27;t smell anything even after playing beach volleyball with a sleeveless shirt on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later found out that the main reason why it didn&#x27;t work was because I didn&#x27;t let the stick get dried in the open air.  Often times I would screw the top back on after drying it with a towel, which turned futile. I could always find condensation on the top that indicated moisture.  Even slightest moist caused the stick to smell.  The odor issue went away after I left the stick \\&quot;top less\\&quot; to get air dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about air dry is the stick last longer, by drying it with a towel or tissue the surface of the stick erodes a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to the functionality of the Thai Stick, it lasts for a long time.  I only have to apply it in the morning and it would last me a 8-10 hours.  If you are looking for a deodorant that is natural and functional, give the Thai brand a try.</li>
    <li> Wow - first day using this product, and it seems to be holding up fine.  I purchased this because I was looking for a deodorant that would keep me dry and odor-free, all while being less toxic (according to the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website:  ewg.org).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to spare my co-workers and customers of any stench in case the product didn&#x27;t work as advertised, and waited until I had a day off to try it.  This morning, I played a round of golf in sunny, 75 degree weather, and though it&#x27;s not as humid as it will get in the summer, should have provided a pretty solid test of the product&#x27;s usefulness.  I gave my pits the sniff test after the round and was pleasantly surprised to find nothing.  I was dry, with no hint of body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review if warranted, but so far it works great.</li>
    <li> So my wife went on the health food kick, and brought this little guy home. I am a sweaty guy, and have been using degree for years because it holds off the sweat. This deodorant works better than the store bought stuff. No perspiration, no smell, and if it lasts for longer than 6 months, I will be extremely happy. Great product- Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For the longest time, I&#x27;ve been slightly paranoid about the ingredients in popular deodorant/anti-perspirants. Axe is considered overbearing, and a lot of peeps overdue the application. When I found Thai Crystal at Whole Foods, I was trying to find something natural that would control odor issues. I have found it with Thai Crystal. It has a neutral scent, and the antibacterial action controls everyday odor. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week, and at the end of the day my armpits are 99% odor free. I highly recommend this product for many reasons, and it&#x27;s also a great value. A+!</li>
    <li> This works great.  I have only used the stone (not the spray) and I find I need to apply it twice a day as a deoderant.  I run the stone under water and then apply it. I have switched to this permanently and will not go back to traditional deoderants/anti-perspirants due to the aluminum.  The stone lasts awhile...I&#x27;ve had mine over a year and still have plenty left, so you can justify the higher cost because you won&#x27;t be buying it as often.</li>
    <li> This natural deodorant is more effective than any chemical laiden product on the drug store shelves.  It costs slightly more to buy, but it will last you over a YEAR!  And, those yellow stains on your white shirts that you attribute to perspiration...?  Guess what, they aren&#x27;t from perspiration... they are from the aluminum and other harmful metals and chemicals in traditional deodorants.  This product makes the entire deodorant/antipirspirant industry obsolete and a health harming scam.    The skin if very porous and absorbable, especially in the sensitive underarm areas and a daily dose of aluminum and chemicals will cause ill health eventually.  Stop using that crap and use this natural salt stone... it contains all of the trace minerals that your body needs and the salt helps to keep you dry.  If your body needs minerals it will abosorb them, if it doesn&#x27;t, they will add protection from odor and staining.  Need I go on???</li>
    <li> Haha, I can tell already I&#x27;m going to get low \\&quot;usefulness\\&quot; because this is a negative review. Lol.    Anyway, if you are like me and you have BO to high heaven and you sweat substantially (I actually don&#x27;t sweat too much I just have insanely pungent smelling BO--I&#x27;m female btw which makes it more embarrassing) and you try this it def. won&#x27;t work.     Rocks and crystal sprays last a maximum of 2 hours for me... with no physical labor... working out, less than an hour. Even during that active time, I still have slight lingering scent of BO. You&#x27;d probably be better of slathering anti-bacterial hand sanitizer on your pits (which actually works, believe it or not... good for those super bad days).    Yet to find an organic/natural deodorant--and now as my BO has gotten worse--a regular deodorant/antiperspirant that works well (that lasts at least 10 hours... my current d/a wears off at 2 pm--6 hours later--very VERY annoying... and I&#x27;m a student and I have a desk job; I do no physical labor).    If you sweat and stink only a tad, this is all you need. No need for any of the hardcore stuff.</li>
    <li> Rock Salt Thai Crystal Deodorant Stone is fantastic!  It works better than either cancer-causing or aluminum-free deodorant.  It also lasts all day, and even after a sweaty workout there&#x27;s no stink!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. It&#x27;s very effective and lasts for a really long time. And most importantly it causes less damage to clothing. .While many  powerful deodorants often leave stains behind after repeated use, the Thai Stick does not leave stains. If you are looking for a natural deodorant, this is your best bet.</li>
    <li> A good product that does not put toxins into one&#x27;s system.  Is great for preventing underarm comfort and no odor.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT. NO ODOR NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU SWEAT! IT IS A LIFE SAVER AS I AM ALLERGIC TO ALL \\&quot;REGULAR\\&quot; DEODORANTS. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> After looking for deodorants for a year since I break out with aluminum deodorants I finally found this and decided to give it a try, I LOVE IT! I tried Toms natural deodorant which SUCKS IT DOESNT EVEN LAST AN HOUR, but this Thai deodorant does even after working out in the gym you still swear but no smell! And it lasts along time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used crystal deodorant before, but as someone who&#x27;s sweaty allergic to perfume, and hates antiperspirants, this is awesome! Be warned that it doesn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re exercising, the one time I wore it while running I completely sweated it off and started to stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it as directed it was decent, but the real trick to getting it to work is swabbing your underarms with rubbing alcohol prior to application.  The salt crystals keep the skin bacteria from multiplying as quickly, but if you decimate the bacterial population with rubbing alcohol prior and let it dry normally then a 4 hour product turns into an 18 hour product.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and it works great. No white marks. Safe for sensitive skin. I will suggest to improve the package. It may works better with a twist to push up and down.</li>
    <li> Ever since the early 80s I&#x27;ve had problems under my left arm. I&#x27;ve tried deodorant after deodorant, only to find that they either don&#x27;t work at all, don&#x27;t work all day, or after a few days make a nasty rash, usually with bad itching. I finally found Naturally Fresh a few years ago, which did an okay job and didn&#x27;t cause a rash or an itch. Then when I bought a new bottle this past spring, I quickly (within a few minutes) had intense itching! I found out it had a new ingredient, zinc ricinoleate, and that&#x27;s what was causing the itch. Well, good riddance Naturally Fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a lot of research on the web, I had a few candidates and found a couple of them at Walgreen&#x27;s. In trying them I had the same outcome as before, and I was at my wit&#x27;s end. I then spotted the Thai Deodorant Stick here at amazon.com. I doubted it would work, but I ordered a stick. I tried it as soon as it came in, and lo and behold, no odor and no itch, even the next day! I suspiciously thought it might be a fluke, so I used it for several days to see if any itching, odor, or rash showed up. One day I did get some pretty significant itching, but I hadn&#x27;t waited until my underarms were completely dry before applying. After a little experimentation, I came to the conclusion that the Thai Deodorant Stick is an outstanding product for me. Finally...FINALLY...I&#x27;ve found a deodorant that works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with it is that I sometimes come close to dropping it because its base is a little too short. It would be nice if the manufacturer extended the base by 3/4 inch or so. That&#x27;s very minor, though. The great thing is... THIS DEODORANT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an alternative to the chemical sticks that are pushed on the masses and this is it!  I have not had an odor issue since I began using this and we have had a fairly hot and humid summer so far.  From other reviews, I also wet my armpit area and then rub the crystal on the area.  I bought this product for some friends and they all are now users.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this and deodorant crystals in general but I was wrong. I remember using a different deodorant crystal when I was in college but I don&#x27;t think I was applying it correctly. I have been through just about every natural deodorant there is to buy and I have also made my own. They are all convincing with their explanations of ingredients but they don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not a particularly sweaty or smelly person but I shower at night. Using all natural deodorants including the ones I made would leave me with the slightest hint of stink when I woke up. Not to mention burnt skin from baking soda. And a house full of beeswax, kaolin clay, essential oils etc. This is why I was suspicious of the Thai Deodorant Stone but I gave it a try. It kind of smells unpleasant itself but the smell does not transfer to the skin. I either wet it under the faucet or apply it while I&#x27;m still wet from the shower. The trick is to apply it in a much larger area than you&#x27;d typically apply traditional deodorant and to make sure to cover the area with several passes over. I haven&#x27;t noticed a bit of stink at all even after running. I don&#x27;t smell like anything. I reapply it in the morning as a just in case but have never had breakthrough stink overnight. I love it and hope it continues to work forever.</li>
    <li> Love this product and safe for our bodies too!</li>
    <li> I love the size of this and the ease of use and not being able to see it either on me or my clothes.  No more yellowing t-shirts!!!  I like to use it immediately when I turn off the shower before I even towel dry.  That way, there is plenty of water on my to make this work smoothly and efficiently.  Then, I towel dry.  Also priced right less than 5 dollars!!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have never felt so confident ...I usually have to change deodorants every couple of months...this stone got me through the summer months without a problem...love it!!!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by two of my coworkers. I have never had a problem with my armpits sweating with regular antiperspirant, but I have recently started noticing a lot of odor. I gave this a try and after about two weeks of use the odor was gone. I am amazed because there are very few products that actually stand out from the crowd. I think it took a few weeks for my pores to open up and get rid of the aluminum from the regular sticks. I have noticed on a few occassions that I get a minor rash. I think it is from storing my stone upside down and it gets minor abrasive qualities. All I have to do is rub the top of the stone after it is wet and it is smooth as silk. It really works!</li>
    <li> I am using this deodorant for an year so far and loving it. It works better when I apply it to the skin without any hair.</li>
    <li> I have mixed reviews about this thing. I also spend about 20 seconds per arm applying it. Yes, it works.. but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for long for me. Maybe half of a day? And you can&#x27;t just reapply it over smelly bacteria on your lunch break - which is inconvenient. I also use another roll on natural brand of deodorant for my mid day freshen up. I also don&#x27;t do really any strenuous activity either, I work on the computer and generally go for a 30 minute jog so it shouldn&#x27;t be wearing off like that. All in all, it works for a short time.</li>
    <li> The Thai Stone deodorant is EXCELLENT!  I had used the spray for many years with varying degrees of satisfaction, it didn&#x27;t always do the job.  I tried the stone and am pleasantly surprised to report that this works like a charm.  With the stone you have better control of where you place the deodorant under your arm.  I have a few skin tags that burn when I get product on them especially after shaving.  With the stone I can avoid those areas, so its much better for me than the spray.  I have been in the intense heat of Florida for the past month and since I use the stone I detect no perspiration odor.  (It is very HOT here and I tend to sweat a lot.)  I highly recommend this product, free of aluminum, parabens and other harsh chemicals and at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Have used for about a week.  I&#x27;m surprised by how well it works and how well it kept body odor in check.  I tried once before but wasn&#x27;t aware you have to wet the stone before application.  DUH!  So happy to not be putting chemical onto my lymph nodes:)</li>
    <li> For those with allergies to standard deodorants, this is a lifesaver.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years and never have to deal with underarm rashes from what I consider to be toxic chemicals.  This is all-natural and, most importantly, it works.  You put it on right out of the shower or you can run it under water for a second and then apply.  Also, a stone like this will last several years....just be careful not to drop it.  You can also buy mini-sizes that are great for travel.  Funny thing is that I&#x27;ve never been able to find this product (or a similar one) in Thailand.  Go figure.</li>
    <li> I tried a &amp;#34;crystal nugget&amp;#34; years ago and it made you smell musty near immediately after showering...so I was a bit skeptical about Thai Crystal. Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this is a &amp;#34;get on the natural bandwagon&amp;#34;  product. It is absolutely the best available. It really does work extremely well. I would highly recommend this item for healthfulness and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have many friends who use the Thai sticks and I&#x27;ve heard all their hype. I purchased a Thai stick and followed  the instructions, putting it on wet right after a shower. Within 20 minutes of sitting around my house, I stunk. I gave it several more tries over a few days, but I almost seemed to smell worse using this than if I didn&#x27;t use deodorant at all. If it won&#x27;t work for me during rest, then I can&#x27;t imagine it would work during a sweaty workout.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product; its reviews were terrific. I perspire very minimally without any antiperspirant, and not at all with typical drugstore antiperspirant. I tried thsi salt deoderant product for six days. Each day the product failed, I perspired, and so each day I applied more and more layers of the product. The additional layering made no difference. I wish I could recommend the product, but I cannot.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of natural deodorants because they never worked, but then i tried this! It really works! It does not keep you from sweating, but it keeps you from smelling. Works so much better than any of those other antiperspirants/deodorants.</li>
    <li> I have always used traditional anti-perspirants, but I knew deep down that the aluminum was bad.  Every so often I would try a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant and every single time I would be disappointed.  They looked like regular deodorant, but within a few hours I could smell that they weren&#x27;t working.  I came across this deodorant stone on Amazon was amazed at all of the great reviews.  I figured for $6, why not give it a shot?  So I did.  And I am so glad I did!  Yes, you will sweat, but if you apply evenly and thoroughly, you will not stink.  It is so refreshing to know something as simple as mineral salt is keeping me odor-free.  It&#x27;s a big relief.  So glad I came across this stuff.  And other reviewers are right on when they mention dropping it.  I have not done so, but I can see how easy it would be.  The base is not very big compared to the large size of the stone.  It is top heavy, so be careful when applying it!</li>
    <li> And amazing is right on. I&#x27;ve about worn my stone out- after over two years, of regular, once-a-day use. Seriously, these things last and last and last. In the past 8 months or so, mine even fell out of the \\&quot;lid\\&quot; so I have to pick it up by hand and rub it around in my pits. YES, the advice to wet it  before use is accurate, I never used mine any other way, and it&#x27;s definitely god for all day. I work hard and very little can out work this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back-story for me, is that regular, commercial deodorants and \\&quot;anti perspirants\\&quot; always burned my pits, or left me with a rash, or something- in short, I stopped using them. Eventually, I went to \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants, and none of them worked. Finally, I saw that my sister had a chunk of the Thai Crystal. I wasn&#x27;t ready to begin toting a \\&quot;rock\\&quot; around, so I wound up with this product- a sweet compromise between both worlds, and THE final word on deodorants! Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly amazed. I was skeptical, but took other reviewers&#x27; word for it, and they were right. The Thai crystal doesn&#x27;t block pores like aluminum-based anti-perspirants, so you will still sweat. However, body odor is almost completely eliminated, and only one application lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Very effective at preventing body odor. Smaller crystal than I expected, but good price, and this will last a long time. Simply moisten and apply, then dry crystal before replacing the cap to prevent dissolving it any more than needed while using. You want to completely avoid all aluminum-based deodorants, absorption of aluminum has been traced to things such as Alzheimers, leaving deposits over time time in the brain. Not good. So definitely choose this!</li>
    <li> I think they forgot a dash. Not 24 hour protection, 2-4 hour protection!  I realize this is not an anti-persperant so I didn&#x27;t expect it to slow down the sweating. I did expect it to at least get me through 8hours....and it doesn&#x27;t. Then again, I live in a hot climate so maybe the bacteria here are different from the bacteria where they tested this.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift from my mom and it works as it says. It keeps the odor at bay, but it is not an antiperspirant, so don&#x27;t expect it to keep you from getting wetness. I wear it during the cooler times of the year just fine, provides the odor protection without feeling like I&#x27;m caked in deodorant.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff, i find it works perfectly, no problems at all. My GF finds she has to apply it carefully and more often, but she is also very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used to use Crystal brand (the original stone deodorant i believe) but the holder is a much poorer design, and the stone can easily fall out and crack when it starts to disolve at the base. In the years since we switched to Thai we have never broken or cracked a single stone, this design has no issues with the base dissolving.</li>
    <li> I bought this stone only about a week ago but I am so happy with it that I had to share.  I am female.  Since I turned 40 two years ago all kinds of weird stuff has been happening with my body.  One of those weird things was funkiness to high heaven.  Before 40, I rarely had body odor (though I used deodorant regularly like everyone else) so this was a new struggle for me.  In the last two years, I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of deodorant, all of which I had used at one point or another in the past and all of which worked fine.  Post-40 they all sucked for me.  I then tried the clinical strength options.  I then tried layering different brands.  I then tried multiple applications.  Nothing worked.  I stank.  Last week, in our local Whole Foods, I ran across this Thai crystal stone deodorant.  I remembered a friend from years ago telling me she used such a product.  She was always a little on the cutting edge with natural products and healthful living.  I couldn&#x27;t remember her review of the product but decided to give it a try.  I actually bought two because it says it also works on foot odor and my hubby could use something in that area.  Anyway, this thing works beautifully!!!  I don&#x27;t stink anymore!  I&#x27;ve given it several tests:  teaching in a sweater in a hot classroom, sleeping under too hot covers, skipping a morning shower, being active at my kids&#x27; soccer practice.  This thing passed all the tests! I don&#x27;t stink anymore...hoorah!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bits of information you might find useful:  1. The first time I used it, it was effective, but not as effective as after the third time or so.  I believe this is because I still had regular deodorant residue and buildup under my arms. This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or buildup so by shower number three, my underarms were squeaky clean and the Thai stone was really reaching my clean skin.  2. I apply it all over my underarm area, not just where there&#x27;s hair.  Another poster mentioned this as well.  Since there&#x27;sno white or gummy residue, you can be super generous with the application without worrying about streaks or buildup.  Put it all over.  3. I do a double application.  I apply it as soon as I dry off out of the shower and then again just before I get dressed.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s necessary, but its what I do.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is a decent product. I don&#x27;t stink after 2 hours like the other natural deoderants in the stores. You do have to put a little water on the stone whenever you use it though because without water it doesn&#x27;t work as well to put on. The lifespan on this deoderant is about 2-3 months (I haven&#x27;t finished mine yet and I bought it in late august). It works, however i&#x27;m sure if you look hard enough you will find a similar product that isn&#x27;t as expensive when you apply shipping.</li>
    <li> Even after reading all the positive reviews I was very skeptical about this product. This deodorant has no scent (that I can tell) and isn&#x27;t visible when applied, but it seems to work. It wears down very slowly, I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months, and it will probably be useable for several years. I work as a night stocker at a large grocery store, and I haven&#x27;t had any odor problems while using this. In fact, it works better than any of the Old Spice stick/gel antiperspirants that I used to wear, which I always found frustrating to clean off thoroughly and ended up making me smell worse over time. I&#x27;ve tried using no deodorant at all, but I get smelly by the end of the work day. This stick gets me through a solid 24 hours until I have time for a shower. This doesn&#x27;t have any masking scent, so I wouldn&#x27;t use it while camping or anywhere where showers aren&#x27;t readily available, but its good enough to get me through a day, even longer if I&#x27;m not doing anything strenuous.</li>
    <li> Yes take a shower and scrub. Then dry your armpits with a towel. Wet the crystal and apply to your armpits. Now get a blow dryer to blow dry your armpits. Viola! The key is to let it dry before putting on your shirt!</li>
    <li> I started using this a few years ago and have only had to buy 2 stones and it will be a while before I buy another one since they last almost forever!! The other deodorants sprays, roll-ons and sticks always left a icky residue that was hard to wash off not to mention very irritating on the skin.  This stuff works, lasts longer nonirritating and feels like you are not even wearing anything. When you think of all the advantages of this deodorant, why even thinking about using the other deodorants on the market?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son who has the worst aempits you ever smelled.  I was considering taking him to the doctor to see about that prescription for excess sweat.  I used to spend megabux on the \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; strength anti-perspirants and he had to apply them 2x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally heard about this product and bought it for my son.  The reviews looked really positive and I didn&#x27;t want to keep subjecting my son to the high levels of aluminum in those strong A/Ps.  He put it to the ultimate test.  He applied ONCE, then over the next 3 days he showered once a day BUT made a point to not wash his pits with any soap, just rinsed with water.  At the end of the third day he was so excited wanting me to smell his armpits, LOL.  He was so proud that they DID NOT SMELL.  Well, maybe a little, but similar to what the typical person would smell like at the end of ONE day if they had used regular A/P in the morning, and remember this was after 3 days and he only put it on once!!  This stuff is incredible.  I just ordered one for me.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product but wanted to eliminate the use of aluminium based deodorant. After 6 or 7 months of use, I can highly recommend this product. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores or have any scent. At the present rate of use I would guess that it will last for years, which makes it very cost effective. Do be aware that the crystal is very hard and will chip if dropped or banged against something hard, the resulting edge can be sharp and create tiny cuts which will look like you are getting a rash. So if you are getting a rash try getting a new one.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything from clinical strength to homemade deodorant&#x27;s and NOTHING has worked for me.  They would wear off before the day was half over.  I tried the Crystal brand of these deodorant crystals a few years back and was terribly disappointed.  I was recommended to this brand and thought &#x27;what the heck, it&#x27;s worth a shot&#x27; and WOW!!  I put this on after my shower and I can go two days before having to re-apply, EVEN after showering!  That is unless I&#x27;m really active and get really hot and sweaty, then I have to re-apply the next day.  I am amazed by this product, and I am guessing it will last me at least a couple years before I run out.  So $7 for a deodorant crystal that will last a few years that actually works?!  YES PLEASE!  Thanks so much for this great product!!</li>
    <li> I read about this product on a travel site and decided to give it a try as my regular old antiperspirant/deodorant just wasn&#x27;t doing the job anymore.  I did a little research and found the Thai Stick stick at a good price.  What you have to remember is that this is not an antiperspirant.  You will still sweat.  The Thai Stick and products like it work by killing the bacteria on your body that feed on your sweat and cause odor as a result of their biological processes.  I use the Thai Stick after each shower and after I run.  It keeps odor down really well.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. As described by other reviewers, just wet and apply to larger area than needed. I only apply once a day and no smell no matter how active I am; living in south Florida you sweat constantly!  For me, began working the first day.</li>
    <li> I love this, much more affordable than roll-on or sprays.  Seems to last YEARS, really.  Mind you it is NOT an antiperspirant, and in hotter weather I (and you) may need an antiperspirant as well.  But this does a fine job as a deodorant. Wipe it onto your wet armpits, simple as that.  No fooling, several YEARS per stick.</li>
    <li> Amazing that this actually works.  You will still sweat tho as its only for stopping smell. Moisten with a few drops water and rub under each arm for about thirty seconds.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month or two now, and think it is absolutely great.    Rock Salt Thai Crystal Deodorant Stone is /not/ perfect.  There is still a bit of odor after use.  HOWEVER, it still works ten times better than the stuff you can find at any store on the shelf, composed of a lot of chemicals.    With everyday use, I can&#x27;t even notice that little bit of odor.  My under arms also /feel/ better.  Whatever I tried before, it tended to make my under arms sore every few months, give or take.  Nothing so far with this.    All it takes is some water to wet it, and then just apply it generously.  It really does last a while, I can&#x27;t really see it getting smaller yet.    One thing to remember, though, is that deodorant is one of those things that vary in effect from person to person.  Some have claimed that Rock Salt Thai Crystal Deodorant Stone has worked wonders for them, while others complain it hasn&#x27;t done a thing.    If you think it&#x27;s worth-it, you should try it out first and see the results yourself.  Give it a week or so to break in, then decide whether you like it or not.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these crystal rock deodorant things the price with shipping came to 18.40 !!! I could of went to the health store down the street and paid 5 $ each and saved $8 don&#x27;t make my same mistake shipping is very high for this product</li>
    <li> I love using natural products &amp; have been using &amp;#34;Crystal Body Stick Deodorant for years. I recently read the reviews &amp; thought I would give this brand a try. I was disappointed when it arrived because the stick is not surrounded or encased. You simply unscrew the lid and the stick is completely exposed. Since I carry one in my gym bag, it can get tossed around in the trunk of the car, or fall of the bench at the gym. With this design, if it fell, the stick would break very easily &amp; crumble. Crystal Body Stick is encased in the plastic container so it is better protected. They seem to be the same formulation so for me, the Crystal stick works better. You do have to keep any crystal stick stored upside down so that when you are done using it, the remaining water won&#x27;t leak down the stick &amp; dissolve the stick quicker than you&#x27;d like. I find they are very long lasting &amp; the Crystal brand is cheaper than this brand as well. I buy the 4 pack for $17.52 here on Amazon which only comes out to $4.38 each versus the Thai stick at $7.87 (both are 4.25oz).&lt;br /&gt;Just wet the stick slightly and rub it LIBERALLY under your entire armpit area. Store stick upside down after use. Summers here in CA can be in the 100&#x27;s &amp; the Crystal stick works great.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is not like other deodorants.  It kills the bacteria that causes the smell.</li>
    <li> This type of deodorant is the best.  Works good for odor but will not stop perspiration.  Lasts for years and no staining of clothing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say, it does a fine job at creating a barrier on your thighs for folks that create friction down there. I keep this stuff stocked.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as to wether this would work or not, but it DOES! I sweat a little less and when I do there is no smell.  I really love this product.</li>
    <li> I have had this deodorant for 3 months and I still have 1/2 the stick left.  It goes on very clean and the protection lasts all day.  The only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; I would make is, you have to wet the stick to apply.  Not a big issue but, if you didn&#x27;t have water available you couldn&#x27;t use it.  There are no masking scents or chemicals going on your skin.  Very clean.  I would highly recommend.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Not the first or last time I will buy this amazing product!</li>
    <li> Great product that I&#x27;ve been using for several years.</li>
    <li> Lasted 1 months before the plastic base came lose and fell off. Go with the pop up type. On a side not, the salt deodorant is great, never going back to a stick.</li>
    <li> Friend of mine wears this. I have trouble with most deodorant  and of course I was complaining about a other deodorant that I waste money on it. Either the deodorant gave me a rash or did not work. I found this deodorant does not give me any problem. It is a natural product and it last a long time.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. One stick a year. No by products, Lasts for over 24 hours. LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
    <li> Works well, and I think this little thing will last me for years to come. Do remember this is a deodorant, not anti-perspirant. It does not stain clothes and has no smell.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s like it should .No messes powder stains ....YES it is very important to have clean damp armpits.So far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d seen this product in the \\&quot;Natural Goods\\&quot; isle and always assumed it could not be as effective as my trusted aerosol. Boy, was I wrong!  A guy overheard me wondering out loud to my friend about its effectiveness and came over and raved about it. \\&quot;It works and that $8 will last 2 years!\\&quot; he said. Another guy walked over and said he uses it as well and loves it. So I bet my $8 and now I&#x27;m the guy raving. It has no scent and I don&#x27;t either when I use it. I still can&#x27;t believe how good it works for such a small price. I found the best way to use it is right out of the shower after toweling off, I leave my pits moist and then apply it. I will never go back to the expensive, scented spray that cakes up on my shirts. This stuff leaves no residue. Spend the $8.</li>
    <li> Some days it works great, some days, not so much.  Ah, the natural d.o. saga continues.  Works best if right after a shower, after that...use another natural d.o. for reapplies or at least use this then follow up with another natural d.o.-- that&#x27;s recommended at all times for best results, longer lasting less stinkiness</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this.  Occasionally I smell sweat on myself.  I&#x27;m learning I need to apply this product liberally.</li>
    <li> My husband has extremely sensitive skin in the underarm area.  We have bought and tried every kind of deodorant on the market and everything gave him a rash under his arms.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this deodorant stone hoping it would work for him. We are happy to report that it works great and he has had no issues of skin irritation/rash from this product.&lt;br /&gt;Usually, any new deodorant product gives him a rash within a few days to a week of using it. He&#x27;s been using this deodorant stone everyday for over a month and so far there are no signs of skin irritation. The price of this product is fantastic in my opinion and the 4.25oz. stone only cost me $7.50 and it is supposed to last for over a year!  We spent well over that in the course of a year trying out all kinds of store bought deodorants. LOL  Definitely a fantastic product and I&#x27;ll continue buying it for him EVERY YEAR! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Doesn&#x27;t stink or anything, but have to reapply. You are still going to sweat, it just isn&#x27;t so gross. It has to kind of build up. So after using it a week or so you should notice a difference. I was told that it makes your armpits so minerally/salty, that it makes the normally warm/moist area uninhabitable for the bacteria that would normally live there and so they don&#x27;t survive/stink. How true that is??? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was working at first, but then I soon realized that when I sweat heavily, it did not help to eliminate or reduce odor.  I think it may work better for females who shave their armpit hair so that the product is applied directly to the skin vs. the hair.  For me, if it doesn&#x27;t do its job when I need it most (when I&#x27;m sweating) then it&#x27;s basically worthless.  The one thing I will say about it is that it&#x27;s non-irritating, but it&#x27;s as effective as using nothing at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Thai Stone Crystal-Deodorant for 15 days and I really like it. In fact, I use the stone with the Thai Crystal Deodorant Mist 8 oz Liquid. Before buying those products, I read some reviews and someone recommended to use both products together (first the liquid and then the stone). I still sweat (a little bit less than in the past), but I do not have any odor from my armpit. I feel more comfortable using those products. I  recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years and they work great if your eating healthy. If not and you dont keep up with the applications things could get a bit noticeable...</li>
    <li> Product shipped quickly and works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I have used deodorant stones for years because I get a rash from antiperspirants. They work great.</li>
    <li> I was kind of exceptical but then I watched some videos and reviews. My conclusion: Natural with no chemicals and with amazing results try it.</li>
    <li> For my armpits I tried to stick with it for a while and see it would kick in but still no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I been using this for a long time now. Just not for my armpits. I use it for my groin area. I had jock itch a while back and after using jock itch cream and a period of time, it seemed to always come back on me. Well this works perfect. It doesn&#x27;t cure jock itch. Go buy proper medication for that. For me it prevents it from coming back. Best of all it keeps everything odorless around my main vein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and people that are over weight and start to get more skin on skin contact areas. Give this a try.</li>
    <li> Because I LOVE the product. I have been looking for something like this but haven&#x27;t found something that actually works..This products works GREAT.</li>
    <li> The first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that does not irritate my skin, AND works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants.. that don&#x27;t contain any aluminum and as little chemicals as possible.  Most of the time they either irritate my skin and / or don&#x27;t last as long as you can smell the sweat after some hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with this one!  I LOVE IT.  has no scent... but I put this on in the morning... and after a hard 8hr work day outside, with some sweating... I do not smell.&lt;br /&gt;This roll on works much better then the spray version.  I sometimes spray the spray few times, then apply this on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item.  I purchased several and will be giving them as Christmas Gifts to my family.  Get your loved ones to stop using those carcinogenic antiperspirant deodorants.</li>
    <li> I order Thai Deodorant for my son because he suffers with skin problems and this deodorant does not irritate his skin and lasts a very long time.  I am a true believer.</li>
    <li> Silly me!  To think that putting salt, which is what this is, under my arm pits wouldn&#x27;t burn like hell!  I tested this product on my forearm a few days before applying it as a deodorant. My forearm wasn&#x27;t immediately burnt.  However, a few weeks latter while on vacation and out in the sun, two streaks of darker skin showed up where I had applied it as a test. The streaks looked like someone had violently grabbed me by the arm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the night that I applied this as a deodorant was memorable.  A few seconds after application, my armpits were sweating, which does not happen with regular deodorants, and then the burning kicked in.  I had it on for about 12 minutes before I had to jump back in the shower and wash this off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why wouldn&#x27;t I have realized that putting salt under my armpits would burn!?!  The skin irritation that resulted was very painful.  It took three days for that to heal. This is just salt and you should not walk around with salt on your skin to begin with.</li>
    <li> I was at the point of going to a Dr. for clinical strength deodorant. I was told about this and tried it...I was frantic. I&#x27;m a police officer and I needed somthing to use with all the heavy, sweaty equipment. Guess what...I FOUND IT!!! Unbelievable!!! I have bought almost two dozen and given them away (sometimes causing a small misunderstanding...lol) My fiancee loves it as much as I do (maybe more)! No more odor, even when I sweat a gallon! AND NO CHEMICALS...Buy It!!!</li>
    <li> It worked for the first two to three weeks. Then it stopped. Aruptly. I did the whole \\&quot;generous\\&quot; spiel, wetting it repeatedly and rubbing it under my arms ALL over, and for some reason it stopped working a week or so ago. I&#x27;m pretty upset because I thought this was \\&quot;the answer\\&quot; and it was going so well, too... it helped me out, but now I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it. Does it run out? I did forget to put the top back on a few times, but would that make a difference in \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; or \\&quot;longevity\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll keep using it, but it won&#x27;t do any good.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and condition. I was expecting to get the big one as I paid for the big one, but received small. But it&#x27;s OK</li>
    <li> This deodorant is packaged such that the salt stick is attached to the base that you hold leaving no adjustment.  If feels very solid and unlike the adjustable sticks, nothing gets clogged in the mechanism. I cannot find these in stores anymore so Amazon is the place!!</li>
    <li> THIS &amp;#34;PRODUCT AND CONTAINER ARE  PRODUCTS OF CHINA&amp;#34;  Just ordered this product.  When I received it, on the back under the bar code it states, &amp;#34;PRODUCT AND CONTAINER ARE PRODUCTS OF CHINA.&amp;#34;  It is NOT made in Thailand.  I see on the picture here on Amazon it states it was made in Thailand.  Well, that isn&#x27;t the case anymore.  The one I received says it was made in China, and Amazon is issuing me a refund and told me to throw it out as it is a designated &amp;#34;toxic substance&amp;#34; and no company will return it to Amazon with that designation.  I would not put anything on my body &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; or that is a designated &amp;#34;toxic substance.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t trust things made in China.  For all I know there could be lead in it.  They&#x27;ve already sent us tainted dog treats that killed and injured many dogs in this Country, and children&#x27;s toys contaminated with lead.  Who knows what&#x27;s in it.  I am going to order the Crystal Body Deodorant Stick, which IS MADE IN THAILAND and not a designated &amp;#34;toxic substance&amp;#34; as per Amazon.  I also emailed Deodorant Stones of America, who said they would send me proof ASAP that it was made in Thailand; but they never asked for my address!</li>
    <li> I have found that some of the alum-free brands were possibly using these salts in their formula- but it was scratching my arms because the granules were too sharp, leaving red rash or chafing. What I use now is one of these stones, followed by a simple, natural deodorant (lately Trader Joe&#x27;s cotton unscented deodorant or Tom&#x27;s) as a lubricant + deodorant. I&#x27;m way beyond slathering toxic, sticky junk (regular antiperspirants) on my underarms but the salt stone alone wasn&#x27;t enough. I find that by combining this stone with either deodorant or a good powder such as the adidad powder or some gold bond (thymol/talc) powder, I get everything I need and none of what I seek to avoid. Get this stone and then find your right balance- you might be OK using just the stone if you aren&#x27;t a sweathog who eats lots of garlic. If I can use this then anyone can.</li>
    <li> No more BO and no more stained clothes.  Jackpot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scrub my skin daily with a rough loofa thingy and then apply this.  Ive noticed a marked decrease in BO and no more stained/waxy clothing.  Im a really sweaty person and no antiperspirant made much difference in reducing the sweat.  They just ruined my clothes.  Im much happier with this.</li>
    <li> So far it has worked well.  I bought it to use when I wear white shirts as regular d&lt;br /&gt;Deodorant leaves stains.</li>
    <li> Ugh. Do not apply this after you&#x27;ve shaved your underarms. It will hurt! It is very irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve followed all of the instructions -- let crystal dry between uses, wet crystal before applying, let product air dry. But it still didn&#x27;t work for me. And not only did it not work, but it also irritated my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this, I applied it right after the shower. It worked really well for that day. Next day, I tried to reapply. That was pointless. The only time I could get it to kinda work is if I put it on right out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it 3 or 4 times. It now no longer works at all. If anything, it makes me smell worse. My mild BO now smells like a wild onion patch. Sexy! Booooo. :(</li>
    <li> Amazing! I don&#x27;t know why, or how.. But it works.  It just works! I tried dozens of products over the years.&lt;br /&gt;This one.. It just works.  And works well.  What sort of strange, unearthly magic is this?! The Force is strong with this one.</li>
    <li> Works great! Not an antiperspirant, but it kills the smell that comes along with the sweat. Lasts all day! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the thai deodorant stone for about two yrs now- started using about a yr after I moved to central florida and it has never let me down despite the hot weather. Just be clean- apply to clean washed dried skin and it will &amp;#34;prevent odors&amp;#34;.  Very happy with the deodorant and definitely works for me.  Since switching over from conventional deodorants and antipersperants, besides the fact that this is a natural mineral stone and better for the body -contains no aluminum (very bad for health), the other perk I noticed is that it lasts a very long time so it has saved me money.  Very happy with and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I smell my armpits but there is no odor. Wha....? Make you get above the armpit and below the armpit a couple of times. Works right after a shower, thats how it&#x27;s supposed to be done. I gotta get used to the sweat coming from my armpits, I&#x27;m not used to it. It&#x27;s not like I sweat that much coming from my armpits.</li>
    <li> I am an unfortunate woman who sweats a lot.  This amazed me.  It keeps me odor free when other deodorants do not.  And no chemicals--yay!</li>
    <li> its very nice. I had some other crystal deodorant you had to screw up to advance the deodorant and it got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t roll up and left crystals every where and wouldn&#x27;t roll up after awhile. This deodorant is smooth and you don&#x27;t have to roll up so don&#x27;t have to worry about crystals everywhere!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now, and I love love love it. No, it won&#x27;t stop you from sweating, but for me it absolutely eliminates any underarm odor whatsoever. And I definitely do get that if I don&#x27;t use a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer to skip the plastic packaging. But, on the other hand, when I had the crystal deodorant that L&#x27;Occitaine used to sell (for a whole lot more $), not having the casing meant that the stone developed really sharp edges that could be quite painful (and it was hard to hold on to as it gradually shrunk in size). This stays smooth. And lasts forever—or at least six months.</li>
    <li> Since having my daughter, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good natural deodorant because the one I&#x27;d been using had too many chemicals that got into my breastmilk and gave my baby bad gas. I tried a few natural ones, but they always wore off after a couple of hours, or caused me to have rash bumps.  Thai stick is the first product I&#x27;ve found that is not only natural, but works REALLY well and lasts all day... AND my underarms are really smoothe now :-)</li>
    <li> I sweat like a... something that sweats a lot. I live in Florida and the weather is hot, humid and downright muggy. I might as well live in a steam room. I also sweat like crazy. After cutting the grass you cannot tell if I jumped in the pool with my clothes on or drenched myself down with the water hose.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying the only thing I miss about my previous antiperspirant is the nice smell. The crystal has no smell but the salt kills any bacteria that cause body odor and I&#x27;ve got cologne to smell good with. You were your pits really well in the shower, dry off, wet the salt crystal and apply liberally. After 1 week I&#x27;ve been to 4 football practices and a football game in 97 degree heat. The only thing that felt comfortable in that heat was my pits with zero body odors. There are reasons other than my sweating as to why to sought out a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to find an antiperspirant without Aluminum in it but was impossible to find in your standard stores. They have found an increased level of aluminum in Alzheimer patient’s brain and an increase in male breast cancer which is right beside your armpit. There is no proven link to aluminum and breast cancer but I&#x27;d rather do without it if I can.</li>
    <li> it really works. it helped me get rid of sweat</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work for me, but it does not. I&#x27;ve been putting it on liberally after I shower and even reapplying. I still smell.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work for me to use this daily (it probably would if you&#x27;re not very active), but it does work on an every-other-day basis winter and summer, and it is very good with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mineral deodorant for over 10 years now.  While living in CA I could purchase it locally.  But, since moving back to my little rinky-dink home town, I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I ordered another manufacturer&#x27;s product on line several years ago (I actually purchased 2), and it worked great, as always.  Then, after about six months, the product I was using started to crumble.  I located the second one I had purchased, and it was crumbling as well.  I was very disappointed.    I pulled out a hand-held (no applicator) version that I&#x27;d had for years, and continued to use it until it got too small to handle.    I like the Thai Crystal very much.  Only time will tell whether I will purchase another one, but I&#x27;m hoping it exceeds my expectations.    I like the applicator versons better, but if necessary, I&#x27;ll go back to the stone you hold in your hand - I know it works extremely well, and lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> For the last year i have been using Axe spray on deodorant to ward off nasty body Oder. Instead of getting the axe effect of hot women clinging all over me, I found suddenly have trouble with nasty BO. It has been this was for the last year and I hadn&#x27;t pinned it to Axe. Recently i have become interested in living an all natural life style and staying away from anything in it that takes me more than one attempt at pronouncing. So after doing some research online and on Amazon I discovered the Thai Rock Salt.    After having it for a week I am amazed by this product. At first, when I opened the package, this wasn&#x27;t a deodorant unlike any other i have used. It rough, has zero smell, and i can&#x27;t even tell if I have applied it to my under arm. Since using it, I have zero trouble with sweating. I do have some body Oder, but it is my body Oder with i am not sweating and dry, so it isn&#x27;t any big deal. Also I don&#x27;t have that nasty BO affect that I had with Axe.</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a better alternative to deodorants and trying to find a product that works all day.&lt;br /&gt;This does and more. This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that would last for more than 24 hours. NO scent or smell.&lt;br /&gt;But does it last, After about 4 months of great use it started to stop working for a bit and I bought the men&#x27;s rock recently to see if it would last longer. The actually rock is still intact but it seemed to lose its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used such an easy to use deodorant that works this good for so long. Simply amazing.</li>
    <li> These crystals do work, but you may notice a bit of a smell at the end of a long day. Not obnoxious, but the way to combat that as some readers have suggested is to do a large area of the underarm repeatedly.  The price went up by over $6, shipping is hefty, so at a total of $14 for this item, I am classifying this as a huge rip-off.  Walgreens and CVS sell the same deodorant crystals for $5 to $6, so save yourself some money if you are just testing. I bought \\&quot;Naturally Fresh\\&quot; with Aloe Vera and have been using it successfully for almost a year.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the Thai or any other label. Mineral crystals are all relatively the same thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same crystal rock deodorant for nearly two years now with no drop in it&#x27;s effectiveness against BO. It has worked very well when applied very liberally and it can be applied right after a shower which makes it very convenient for me.    The main reason behind my initial purchase of this crystal rock was a bad rash and large lumps that would constantly appear just a day after I began using regular brand name deodorants. I was seriously worried that I might stink for the rest of my life until I found this convenient little product and I can&#x27;t imagine living without it now. I haven&#x27;t gotten any rashes or lumps in the area in nearly two years and I smell great until my next shower.    The real miraculous thing about this product is the fact that the one stick I bought for ten bucks or so has lasted nearly two years and has helped me smell great at my highest weight of 265(I&#x27;ve lost over forty pounds since and it only improves haha).    EDIT:  Some of the extra details regarding the crystal rock deodorant that I forgot to mention are it&#x27;s effectiveness when I&#x27;m working out at the gym. I myself have had pretty good results with this crystal rock deodorant when I work out with heavy weights and 30 minute cardio(running, swimming and biking) sessions. I&#x27;ve come to think of this crystal rock as the perfect partner to any lifestyle whether it&#x27;s an active or sedentary lifestyle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at any negative reviews on this product as I, my wife and several family members both near and far have used this product for several years with complete satisfaction. It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant just a deodorant and for that use it excels. The main point here is you&#x27;re not slathering a plethora of chemicals on an area of your body that allows them to leach into your system. A big plus, it lasts a real lonnnngggg time.....</li>
    <li> I am blown away at how well this works.  Follow the suggestions in these reviews.  Cover a wide swath of armpit.  NOBO here!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe this thing works... but it does!</li>
    <li> For some reason this one doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well for both me and my husband as the one the comes in the basket. They are both the same thing so I know this makes no sense, but with this one I can&#x27;t get through a whole day before the deoderant quits. With the basket one I could do 2 days and work out and still be good!!!</li>
    <li> Well pleased.  Recommend it to others.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I was skeptical, but it keeps my dry and odor-free.  Simply run the end under water to wet it, and apply.  It dries  in seconds and lasts all day.  I wish I&#x27;d found it sooner and stopped using cancinogenic deodorants long ago.</li>
    <li> This is great!  The key to its effectiveness is PUT ON A LOT!  I have tried a quick swipe or two, and, in that case, it doesn&#x27;t work.  I usually wet it and then rub it around for about 30 seconds on each armpit.  When you do that, it works great, no body odor.  I have tried the crystal roll-on deodorant, and that doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I have tried Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant.  Likewise, that causes me to smell terrible.  So, as a woman who has the potential to be foul smelling, I can vouch that, as long as you put a lot of this on, it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This deodorant stone works well and does not stain clothing.  Run it under the cold water faucet and then rub in under you axilla or arm pit.  It works well for me, but my sons need a stronger deodorant.  I use it every day and if I work out side in hot weather I usually refresh is after coming in.  It is natural with no aluminum or other harmful chemicals.  I have been using it for more than 10 years and really like it.</li>
    <li> This deodorant did not work for me, even with wetting it first. Left me stinky. Too bad. Wish I could find one with no chemicals in it that works. So far I have not.</li>
    <li> works pretty well but starts to fail at the end of the day..allows you to avoid all of the aluminum in other antiperspirants..</li>
    <li> have used this now for years... My wife and I love it...  (just dont drop it)  try it you will be amazed!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but you have to use a lot of it. Other than that I like it.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. Much better than using chemicals.</li>
    <li> I smell, I sweat, I swear loudly. Rubbing this wet salt lick on my armpit did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I usually do not write reviews, but this product deserves one.  I have been using natural deodorant for many years, have tried different brands with average to poor results, some would work for a little while then stop working and the BO would come back.  This product is great, it keeps me dry and completely smell free.  I shared it with a friend who didn&#x27;t believe it would keep her dry an she is in love with it too.  This product is really unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I bought a stick of this product about 11 months ago--I was quite skeptical, but all the positive reviews intrigued me.  I wasn&#x27;t interested so much for the health benefits, although that&#x27;s a plus (no aluminum and all that), but I was really getting sick of all the shiny aluminum residue that was staying on my shirts even after laundering them.  Here&#x27;s the bottom line: No residue and no odor.  I still sweat quite a bit, but I always did, even with supposed antiperperant.  Give it a go, for $6 or $7 I see my lasting for well over a year, and my wife even uses it quite a bit.  Just don&#x27;t drop it, because it will chip off--I lost about a month worth of deodorant a while back when I dropped it :)</li>
    <li> Outstanding! Wish I had this years ago. We hesitated to order even after reading the positive reviews but finally did and my wife and I are greatly satisfied with the results. You do need to clean the area well and apply perhaps over a larger area than if you used typical deodorant sticks but it goes a long way and outperforms anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past and without the gummy feeling left by other deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would leave a review for a deodorant but it&#x27;s that good. It would make a good stocking stuffer but it&#x27;s not exactly something one usually gives someone or even discusses as hey, it&#x27;s the pits after all, it&#x27;s something you usually keep to yourself if you get my meaning.</li>
    <li> If you are considering this product, PLACE YOUR ORDER!!! I purchased it after a friend made me aware of it. This is an amazing alternative to any deodorant I have ever used. After two months of use, I have no complaints, although I would caution placing a salt product on freshly shaved armpits. Ouch! I was using clinical strength anti-perspirant that my odor would break through after a good sweat. I have not experienced this problem with the Thai Deodorant.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works! I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of natural deodorants for years and have never found on that actually does work and last all day.  This does the trick if applied liberally (like 25 swipes per side).  That&#x27;s the key to making this work.  My only complaint is the packaging. It is a huge stick of mineral salt on top of a plastic base. If you drop it, it looks like it could shatter completely, so I  use extra care when handling it over a tile bathroom floor. I feel like it could break in my bag when traveling as well because of the way the packaging is designed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked at how well this stuff works for me.  I&#x27;ve tried various types of aluminum free deodorants and this one is the best.  Prior to this I was using Kiss My Face liquid roll on, which does work well but I still would get a hint of BO at the end of the day (in all fairness I think I was the only one that smelled it).  Thai Crystal works better in my opinion.  When applying to your underarm, make sure you get good coverage...I&#x27;ll go a little further up and around my underarm just to make sure.  No problems at all...I use it every day.  I think its a better value than any other because while it costs more than almost everything else, it also lasts way longer.  Give it a try...I find that with some people these deodorants work and with others not so much, but I&#x27;ve got my wife using it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/11/15 - If you can believe it I am still using the Thai Crystal from my original purchase!  How&#x27;s that for value?  It still works awesome and its lasted me 2 years.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and loves it. There is no odor to it so I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well this works. I haven&#x27;t found a single deorant that worked on me until this one! I&#x27;ve been using this for years and still works great!!!</li>
    <li> I was doubtful for a while about this until I tried my husband&#x27;s (The deoderant stone with the velvet pouch) wow!! We live in Las Vegas and I tried it and went out for the day. I kept sniffing to see if I stink, and I don&#x27;t!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT an anti-antiperspirant. Which is fine, sweating helps you cool down. I&#x27;m more concerned about stinking. I work outside most of the day, and sure enough no stink after a 10hr day. My husband loves his as well, same thing, you sweat but don&#x27;t stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a salt, no aluminum or anything harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING! I shaved then put this on... IT IS SALT. IT DOES STING!!! Just a heads up &#x3D;o)</li>
    <li> My girlfriend says my pits don&#x27;t STANK anymore. That&#x27;s a plus! Took about 2 applications before it fully worked, but I am highly impressed. I have had major problems with rashes from both Deodorants and antiperspirants. Not with this salt lick though. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Delicious on pad Thai</li>
    <li> This deodorant is really quite amazing. There is no scent and this eliminates underarm odor better than the traditional antiperspirant/deodorants I have used for 30 years. I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stone is wet rubbed on your armpits, or just rub on them after a shower when they are still wet. It dries clear and does not leave a residue on clothing. I am not sure how long it will last because I just started using it in the past several days, but it looks like it might outlast traditional roll on bottles that I have used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much, that I am getting my wife to switch, and I am ordering the 2 oz size for travel.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works amazingly! I&#x27;m very satisfied and refer this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works amazing first few months! Then stops working slowly till it eventually works no more. I was excited to find this product to bad it didn&#x27;t have same results over time I used it.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for being perfect! I&#x27;m so glad I have replaced my typical deodorants with this stick.  I&#x27;ve tried so many brands to find something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and manage to hide my body odor.  Since the first day I started using this deodorant, my underarms are no longer irritated and it unbelievably covers up any odors.  Fortunately, I&#x27;ve never had any issues with wetness, so this stick is a good fit for me.  I&#x27;ve used this for almost a month already and it still looks brand new.  I can definitely see this lasting me for many, many months.</li>
    <li> Only as a deodorant, this is great. It leaves no residue on skin or clothes and so far seems to greatly help with odor. This is super cheap and lasts a long time with no dangerous additives. Others have explained in detail how to get best results, which I&#x27;ll replicate here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this to work, make sure to get it thoroughly wet and rub on the armpits and surrounding area (arm and towards the chest) for a good 30 seconds or so. Same goes for feet if you use it for that. Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other deodorants, this one is around the cost of a 2-month supply of commercial deodorants, yet is considerably cleaner and more effective and also lasts way longer. I&#x27;ve only been using mine for a while now, but I expect it to last at least a year. It&#x27;s a great bargain and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to using normal/regular store deodorants. Have used this for years and works for me. My sweating is normal not too much or too little; and body order can get smelly on heavy sweat days. This handles the heavy sweat days, with no sweat ;)  Added plus of not putting nasty chemicals under your arms. Oh and it lasts a very long time. Glad I found it here for sale.  Have read some reviews stating that, Thai Crystal Deodorant was now made in China and not the same quality. The 2 pack, received states that it is made in Thailand and looks just like previous ones ordered. This was ordered from &amp;#34;Avalanche Brands&amp;#34;.  Just be careful handling it [It can be a bit top heavy and I&#x27;ve broken one or two in my lifetime.]. Grip it firmly or else it will shatter. Once they&#x27;re shattered, it&#x27;s torture using the stick, in my opinion. ;)</li>
    <li> This stick did not work at all for me. I tried wetting it more and using it all up and down the inside of my armpit. I tried wetting it less and re-applying a few times. Nothing worked.</li>
    <li> I almost never write reviews for things I buy on amazon, but this deodorant has been so great I had to let my fellow shoppers know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I used natural deodorant ( arm and hammer, kiss my face, desert essence, toms of maine, trader joes...etc) and they were awful! After about four hours I always smelled rather like BO (and I don&#x27;t even sweat much!) Even though I knew that aluminum wasn&#x27;t good for me, due to the risks of breast cancer and such, I switched over to Secret Deodorant just so I could be sure that I smelled fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cue this gem! I was tired of the stains Secret left on my clothes, and how it built-up on my underarms and made it difficult to shave there. I also was concerned about the safety of using it, so I searched on Amazon and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS DEODORANT WORKS. Seriously. It does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this deodorant twice a day. Once a night after I shower (your underarms need to be wet before you apply it) and in the morning I wet the stick and apply it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stick completely blocks ANY scent of BO. I have no smell all day long! (and I have some pretty long, arduous days!) And not only that, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes at all! and it doesn&#x27;t build up on your underarms. How&#x27;s that for a triple threat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as a recap, if you&#x27;re reading this, and like me had tried a bunch of natural deodorants to no avail, buy this one! You definitely won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and I absolutely love it! I was skeptical at first thinking how the hell will salt take away that \\&quot;funk\\&quot;.  But after a trial run this product proves to be the best deodorant money can buy! Although it will not stop you from sweating like other deodorants out there, but it will definitely take away the \\&quot;funk\\&quot; and it won&#x27;t cause cancer or alzheimer from all those harmful ingredients they put into the regular deodorant such as aluminum chloride, aluminum zirconium, ticholorohydrex glycine, aluminum chlorohydrate, or aluminum hydroxybromide.  So I highly recommend this item for anyone that&#x27;s active and wants to get rid of that \\&quot;funk\\&quot;, naturally!</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant, it&#x27;s a guaranteed 12 hour protection for me and if I leave it on for 24 hours there may be a very slight odor but nothing bad at all.  I think it may help to have shaved pits for it to work the best but i&#x27;m pretty sure it should work just as well for those with hair.  Just be aware that if your have a cut or have irritated skin that you will have a slight burning sensation for a few mins but it will go away and it&#x27;s tolerable but the good thing is that the salt is helping to heal the skin so that&#x27;s why it feels that way.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better for you, NO BAD ALUM or other chemicals, less bad things to enter your body.&lt;br /&gt;It will last for almost a year or so, so it will definitely pay for itself.&lt;br /&gt;Plus I love the shape and the bottom plastic piece it&#x27;s attached to so you will less likely drop it and accidentally break it.&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s a great size to carry it with you in your bag or purse wherever you go.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and if you don&#x27;t like it rinse it off and give it to someone else hehe.</li>
    <li> Works great to keep odor out the door. However, I would have loved it better if it had a little soft scent  to it. I sometimes feel as though it may not work because its unscented.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to using regular deodorant or antiperspirant again. This stuff is clear and will not show up on your clothes. Ever. Although it doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating (which is fine with me), it does a pretty good job of keeping you from smelling. There have been a couple of days where I could catch a whiff of myself, but I blame that on the NC summer heat. I&#x27;ve been using the crystal for a few months now and I&#x27;m only halfway through it. I will say that since its used with water, the crystal has shrunk a little and falls out of the container. But as long as you know this, you can hold it in when applying to prevent that from happening. I will definitely continue to use this deodorant!</li>
    <li> Good but not 100 percent. Not like deodorant s with aluminum. .</li>
    <li> First there is no residue like other deodorants...&lt;br /&gt;No odor...&lt;br /&gt;No white marks...&lt;br /&gt;Lasts forever....&lt;br /&gt;And it actually works! Yay! :)&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this deodorant. I&#x27;ve been trying to use it for months. When I smell my skin after sweating, my skin doesn&#x27;t smell. However, my clothes do still smell, and they have developed a stink even after being washed. I think I&#x27;m going to have to switch back to a regular aluminum-free deodorant. :/</li>
    <li> Update - after using for three months I started getting horrible red and pure rash under both armpits. It works great with odor but I think it&#x27;s too much salt or something. It actually scares me to try it again. Stopped for a but used it again same story.  Was an Amazing product!  So very happy i found something that truly works great just wished the horrible embarrassing breakouts did not happen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20 years and am very satisfied.  You must use it every day for consistent protection.  It&#x27;s free of aluminum and other chemicals.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put behind my ears.  Seemed like no matter how much I scrubbed behind them with soap and water in the shower, they&#x27;d still have a foul odor a few hours later.  Just run it under water for a second and rub behind the ears.  I never have any odor behind the ears anymore and the product applies easily and doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything there.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little inconvenient feeling &amp; we&#x27;re so used to slathering something on, but if u can get over that - it works!!!</li>
    <li> I hate to give this a poor review, as I was soooo hoping to love this product.  I don&#x27;t sweat heavy so much as stinky, so this seemed so promising.  I am a 31 year old female, work a desk job, am fairly active (love my sweaty hot yoga!!), and I eat a very clean paleo diet (some have suggested in reviews/comments that diet is the key to less BO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed many of the tricks mentioned here to fully scrub my pits with soap before application, make sure to apply to the entire underarm area, etc etc...but this does not seem to do the trick for me.  I started to apply in conjunction with certain-dri as well, but that actually only seemed to worsen the agitation side effects of the certain dri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another weird thing...the stick itself starts to smell!!  I have had to wash it off several times...it starts to smell exactly like what it makes my underarms smell like.  I think my chemistry just does not like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this only seems to give me a weird smell to my underarms.  I try, try, try to make sure I am removing all of the bacteria from my underarms by scrubbing and scrubbing with soap before application...but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  If I apply it the night before and then use deodorant the next morning, it mixes weirdly and just to me smells like I am masking BO (gross). I have given this a couple of months and I am now off to search for something new.  Or back to certain dri, which so far is the more effective thing I have tried, as long as I can manage to bear the agitation to my skin.  Good luck, with all the good reviews maybe it is worth a try for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay is the best way to sum it up. I love the idea that there&#x27;s nothing bad in here like aluminum. I like how it goes on and feels comfortable. Doesn&#x27;t stain my undershirts. Has no smell. Doesn&#x27;t leave me itchy or give me rashes like some deodorants. HOWEVER, the most important thing about a deodorant is how it leaves you smelling hours later. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1, 230 lbs if that matters, but this deodorant doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling good toward the end of the day whereas other deodorants do. I only use this deodorant now if I know I am not doing any physical activity and am not going out anywhere after work. Or for a lazy sunday at home. For that purpose, it&#x27;s great. I will buy this again and keep it in the house alongside a more powerful deodorant. It just sucks to have to always buy two deodorants. Wish this was stronger.</li>
    <li> These deodorant sticks do a fine job of keeping odor away from my underarms, while allowing me to perspire naturally. In addition, they last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Lasts more than a year with daily use.  But adding water prior to use begins to dissolve the &#x27;knobby&#x27; section held in place by the plastic base.  Doesn&#x27;t help that the plastic base will hold some standing water further promoting dissolution.  Eventually the stick will come out, hopefully not dropping to the floor and cracking :)  I find it easier to cut off the base around month 4.</li>
    <li> These have been my favorites for years!!  They last a long time, no nasty chemical smell, nor cancer-inducing aluminum content like 99% of deodorant out there.  Recently, I have placed another order, expecting what I have always been getting.  I was sorely disappointed.  These are no longer made in Thailand.  They are now made in China!  Not only that, the content is less, despite the label still listing the same 4.25 oz weight.  Check out the picture I have attached.  The color of the stone is different, and it is smaller.  The cap on the old Made in Thailand stones have rounded top with the sticker &amp;#34;Over 10 million sold&amp;#34;.  The Made in China cap is squared off and has no sticker, as well as the tell-tale Made in China label.  I tried to return and bought from another seller with the same result, still made in China.  If anyone know any seller have Made in Thailand stones, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;1) DST, bring back the made in Thailand stones, and stop cheating us by selling less with the same weight listed.&lt;br /&gt;2) Amazon, please change the description picture, it&#x27;s no longer accurate.  The current picture is Made in Thailand one.  The stones being shipped have different packaging.</li>
    <li> Item came quickly and was packed well. I tried this because I was having problems breaking out with other stones. It does the job, perfectly. No more irritation.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stone for over 30 years, I started with a stone my Son bought me at a flea market at Rices market in Bucks county PA. I have used it ever since once I tried regular deodorant and broke out in a rash, I also use the liquid produce adding my own essential oil for a little spice. I would highly recommend this produce.</li>
    <li> Makes my armpit whiter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find an effective deodorant.  I was hoping to have something with no chemicals, but same odor by end of the day whether I use it or not so will not be reordering this product.</li>
    <li> The only problem is that you can&#x27;t take the label off of the top. Other than that, it works great!</li>
    <li> Folks, I&#x27;m sorry to knock what may be working for you, but in researching safe deodorant options, I came across this link --[...]&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, even though crystal rock deodorants don&#x27;t contain many of the potentially-unhealthy chemicals of antiperspirants, they do contain aluminum. Just wanted to share this, for those of you who may be interested.</li>
    <li> I found it to be not that good at keeping you &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; for long. But neither were the others I&#x27;ve tried, so it&#x27;s not any worse than the rest of the natural deodorants.</li>
    <li> It works...keeps me dry..and will last a very long time</li>
    <li> This deodorant stone really works. Finally!... and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> Crystal stick works great! Does keep the arms from creating too much sweat smell. I work in an environment that is constantly hot, so its usefulness wears off as the day goes on. Probably not the case for more casual work environments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside to stick - it dissolves. when it does, you&#x27;ll have to be careful as you apply it. I dropped my crystal and it broke into two pieces. Large enough to use, but awkward to wet it down, hold it and then apply in armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: if you&#x27;re a crystal deodorant wearer, this will work. If you&#x27;re interesting in switching from the white-stick deodorants, its worth a try at a low price</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect deodorant for years and I finally found it! Every other deodorant began smelling weird after a few hours of wearing it, but not this one. I smell great all day and night long. I think the difference is the lack of aluminum honestly.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Last almost a year</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I&#x27;m on my second one - I&#x27;ll never go back to standard anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> Keeps you fresh without a perfumey odor of its own.  Lasts a long time.  Unusual to get used to, but healthy and worthy alternative to more popular deodorants.</li>
    <li> The crystal deodorant is perfect for me.  There is no sticky mess under my arms, no fragrance - just natural crystal to keep odor in check.  It is not an antiperspirant, so if someone is looking for that, this product does not provide that.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating, but will keep you from stinkin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;This crystal has lasted me more than a year. If you have allergies to all the others, this is the one you want.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this actually seems to work at all, plus there are cheaper options at my grocery store --- but wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  Some deodorants have even left me with chemical burns.  I am not a huge sweater but I have had an issue with odor that no deodorant has ever been able to solve.  I have tried them all... and yes when I saw ALL I mean it! Every over the counter brands at major department stores.  A friend suggested crystal deodorant and I had tried a few with little luck.  So I decided to give this a try.  It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and NO SMELL! No smell at all!! I even tested it by working in the yard and not washing my pits for 2 days just to see if it really was the deodorant that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying right after shaving does leave me with a little slight sting.  I would like to remind that my skin is very sensitive and I am allergic to a lot of things.  This sting wasn&#x27;t bothersome enough to stop using the brand and it doesn&#x27;t last very long after applied.  My past chemical burn marks are clearing up nicely and I am again comfortable with going out and not smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is not scented!  I also love that I can wear my black tank tops without residue. I hear this works well with foot odor also.... I may try it out of my husband.</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot! My sweat mixed with chemical deodorants always ended up ruining my shirts and leaving a BO smell.  This stuff works like a charm!  No odor, No stains, and much less sweat in general! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> What, you don&#x27;t believe that rubbing a wet mineral stick under your arms could possibly prevent BO?  Well...believe it.  Between the fuss over the possible health consequences of antiperspirants, and the fact that normal deodorant- at best- masks the problem, these Thai Sticks are a GODSEND.  I&#x27;ve switched to using this each morning instead of normal products, and have never looked back.  Not to mention, no more white spots on clothing and these things last forever!</li>
    <li> 1. WASH the stick completely before, in between armpits, and after you are done.  Just rub the stick with your hand under running water.  This will clean most of the bacteria and preventing transferring between application.&lt;br /&gt;2. Do a wider range of application.  All places where skin-to-skin contacts when you put your arm down.  A bit above, below, and around where you normally would.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Air-dry before covering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can go over a 1-3 days after shaving and not smell.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money.</li>
    <li> True to other reviews, this Thai Crystal product really works.  Apply liberally, and not even the most remote odor at the end of the day.  My best major brand deodorant cant even do that.  It is not an antiperspirant, so don&#x27;t expect to stay dry.</li>
    <li> For years now I&#x27;ve been wanting to find a way to stop cramming aluminium and titanium into my pores. It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to realize that it&#x27;s bad for you. However, it&#x27;s hard not to worry that you&#x27;re going to become the smelly hippy as a result! Honestly I&#x27;d rather be that than to get cancer or whatever else it might cause...but social pressure is tough. Thankfully, YOU CAN BE  SAFE AND SMELL GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s possible and Thai Crystals are amazing. I recently made a major overhaul of my daily hygiene products in favor of non-toxic substitutes. I looked for items that weren&#x27;t super-expensive, were verifiably safe, and had solid reviews. It was hard to miss Thai Crystal Deodorant Stick on Amazon...so I gave it a shot. I am so glad I did. It&#x27;s important to note that for about $7 it lasts about a year. I&#x27;m just past 3 months and I&#x27;ve probably used about 20-30% of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, about me: I&#x27;m 29, male, in good shape, exercise frequently, play sports, and sweat like a maniac. Ever seen Andy Roddick playing tennis and the sweat is just pouring off of him? That&#x27;s me, without a doubt. Oh and I live in 100% humidity Miami, FL to boot. For years I have tried to find an antiperspirant that did the job...and failed. Even the clinical strength stuff made no difference. I don&#x27;t think I have any sort of odor problem but there&#x27;s no doubt that if I don&#x27;t put on deodorant in the morning I will get stinky by the afternoon. Even with my previous favorite, Axe Phoenix Dry Solid, I knew it was just masking the odor. At the gym I could tell my nice fragrance changed to a still-ok-but-not-so-great mix of odor vs. fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Thai Crystals. I read online that it might take a week of \\&quot;pit detox\\&quot; to really see how a new product works. Maybe that&#x27;s true for someone out of shape but it worked for me right away...and it was better! The perspiration that I never found a solution for is probably still the same - but certainly not any worse. The odor is, in my opinion, better controlled. Unless I&#x27;m working out or playing sports I can&#x27;t smell anything. Even during a heavy workout or a few hours of tennis (outside) all I get is a very natural smelling odor that is hardly what I&#x27;d call \\&quot;BO\\&quot; and it&#x27;s not very strong or even noticeable unless I lift my arms and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---3 months of use (threw my old stuff away) and I have not had one person mention that I smell bad (and I&#x27;ve asked my friends to be on the look out!)---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage tips:&lt;br /&gt;-The mineral salts in this product prevents bacterial growth. As such, it works better if you let it prevent the bacteria to begin with. If you decide to be lazy and skip using it and get a little smelly before you put it on, it won&#x27;t work as well.

    <li> I have a secret \\&quot;super-power\\&quot;. It&#x27;s not flying, it&#x27;s not lasers shooting out of my eyes, it&#x27;s being able to neutralize deodorants. Whenever I buy a new type of deodorant it works at first, then after a couple of weeks my body adapts to it and my powerful odors start to wilt nearby greenery. The clinical strength versions last a little longer, but I overpower them as well. Not something I&#x27;m proud of, but there it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I had nothing to lose with the Thai Deodorant stick, and six weeks later I&#x27;m still odor free. Yeah!  I put it on after showering in the morning and it lasts all day. Like one reviewer noted, I do need to cover a few inches more than just my armpits. Also after six weeks the stone doesn&#x27;t even look used, so it has a long life ahead of it and is a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Thai Deodorant Stick, you really are a superhero!</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever!  Natural, keeps odors away and lasts a long time!  I wish it were available in stores but getting it at Amazon.com is wonderful.  I buy two and give one to friends because it is great for people concerned about aluminum in most deotorants.</li>
    <li> Just love this deodorant.  It lets me perspire but there is no odor and it lasts at least 24 hours.  I feel this deodorant stick will last me a year!!!&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I am getting odor protection without harsh chemicals. After a family member was diagnosed with breast cancer, I woke up and realized I needed to do some research on, not only what I am putting in my body, but on it as well... There are minimal regulations on haircare, beauty and personal products despite all of the correlations between the chemicals in them and cancer. Deodorant and antiperspirant is one of the worst things a woman can use because of the close proximity to the lymph nodes. Thai deodorant stones do not prevent sweat which is the only downfall, but on the other hand, it is natural to sweat.  It does prevent odor and you never have stains on your clothes or those annoying white marks when putting on a shirt.  I am willing to deal with a little wetness. I&#x27;m a big fan of these :)</li>
    <li> Great, same and bigger than what I can get at my local store for a better price too. Fast shipping, very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have use this brand of deodorant for many years and find that it works really well. It was shipped on time and it was in perfect condition when I received it. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I have found with this after one year of almost continuous use....    It is very effective.  I sweat a LOT compared to many men.  There have been times when I have found that it does not work (seemingly), but I have found a few tricks in the process.  The first is that if you do not SCRUB under your arms in the shower it may not work.  If you come out of the shower and your arms have any stink to them, then you didn&#x27;t do your job in the shower correctly, and the stone will not work all day.  Second, my shirts often have smell in them, which causes me to smell when my underarms get wet.  The way I have found to combat this is to soak my shirts in epsom salt water for 24 hours before putting it in the wash.    Following these rules has made this stone work perfectly even on the hottest days.  After one year, I think my stick has gone down about half an inch.  I expect to get at least one more year out of it.  After wetting, I rub it about 20-30 times under my arm (I don&#x27;t know if it actually helps to repeat so many times, but it helps my peace of mind).    I hope this helps some in their decision!</li>
    <li> Contains aluminum, which is what most of us are trying to avoid by purchasing this type of item.  They just use another word for it...</li>
    <li> Original review July 4, 2012: Your underarm bacteria creates odor by eating your sweat and oils. The trick is that you must remove ALL the existing bacteria on your skin before you apply this Thai stone. You can shower and scrub but that is not going to kill all the bacteria. Scrubbing can also hurt your skin and cause chafing.  Shower normally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, use alcohol wipes (I recommend large size Webcol wipes or any other brand you like) to gently swipe your underarms a few times. NOT TOO HARD. Let it dry off for a few seconds - the alcohol drying effect lyses/kills the bacteria with minimal scrubbing and skin damage. Some of you might think that Dial/Irish Spring/ etc antibacterial soaps help, but all they do is damage your skin due to prolonged contact when compared with a few gentle strokes with alcohol wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then apply the stone. Wet the stone and apply all around your pits and even outside the area, like others have said. Let it dry before you put on the clothes. The salts from the Thai stone, when dried on the skin, prevents bacteria from growing. It does not \\&quot;kill\\&quot; bacteria - the alcohol pads do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila! Odor free all day! I&#x27;ve gone 2 days without showering, sweating like a mule in 90+F NYC weather, still no smell! I LOVE THIS STONE!&lt;br /&gt;The salt does NOT stain clothes; in fact it might even settle into the fibers and prevent future odor (not sure but it seems possible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Another tip is that your clothes must be odor-free initially. You can wash existing clothes with a little vinegar or start wearing new clothes. Some of the smell or bacteria in old clothes is re-activated when you sweat, leading you to think your stone is not working. No, it&#x27;s the old clothes. Either get new clothes or treat your old clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to Webcol alcohol wipes: [[ASIN:B0015TF8RK WEBCOL LARGE (2 PLY) ALCOHOL PREPS, 200/CARTON - Item #: 685110]]. You can use any other brand but I like this one because it&#x27;s large and saturated well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/19/13&lt;br /&gt;This Thai Deodorant Stick continues to work BRILLIANTLY. I am a dermatologist and I have been recommending this to everybody with sensitivity to regular deodorants, and even other patients who are looking for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; alternatives. I have phased out any of my clothing that had residual BO. Yes this is a problem if you continue to sweat - even if you apply this stick, your sweat will re-activate the odors on your old clothes even if you have washed them normally. Vinegar helps to remove old odors but I have not been fully successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now combined this with Botox of my armpits to stop sweating altogether. This stone, combined with little-to-none sweat, is my holy grail of odor and sweat control.</li>
    <li> I always worried about aluminum absorption but never heard good things about \\&quot;hippie\\&quot; deodorant products (and people I knew who used things like Tom&#x27;s always had the worst BO).  I tried several brands of salt deodorant products in the last year and have settled on this - it&#x27;s the best!    It is different than regular deodorants.  You need to apply it more liberally and more often, especially if you are sweating a lot.  It isn&#x27;t antiperspirant, so it will let you sweat as much as is normal for you.  It isn&#x27;t thick and gooey, so it doesn&#x27;t form as much of a film on your skin.  And if you do start to smell, you won&#x27;t smell like some rancid mix of and deodorizing chemicals and foreign scents.  You&#x27;ll just smell like yourself.    Since it isn&#x27;t scented, applying it when you&#x27;re already smelly won&#x27;t do anything.  However, it does inhibit the bacterial growth that causes smelliness as long as you get plenty applied.    Thai crystal is better than other salt stones.  Something about the way they make theirs prevents a major problem with other types of stones.  Other stones get eaten away by the water you use when you apply the product.  They get sharp swiss-cheese-like holes in them which are unpleasant to rub against your sensitive armpits.  My Thai crystal has stayed smooth and solid over several months of use, and prevents odor better than the other salt products I&#x27;ve tried.  It takes a few weeks to sort of ramp down from regular deodorants and get used to, so I would recommend that you not give up after the first day of using an unfamiliar product.    I would recommend that you give this product a shot for a couple of months.  Get used to the way it works and I think you&#x27;ll find you have less BO, your BO is less unpleasant, and you&#x27;ll have less anxiety about aluminums absorbing through your skin.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product in an easy to use package.  The container is critical because I usually drop and break the stick long before I use up the crystal material. The product works great and lasts for years (if you don&#x27;t drop it).</li>
    <li> Not *quite* as convenient as deodorant, but more effective in my experience. You have to get it wet and rub it all over your armpit area repeatedly. I find it easiest to do this right after showering. Your armpits are going to be wet for a little bit, which is a little uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS DOES NOT PREVENT YOU FROM SWEATING. Nor does it claim to. It simply prevents you from stinking. Even after sweating like crazy all day in the Arizona summer heat, there is absolutely no smell coming from my armpits. I&#x27;ve never found any deodorant or deodorant/antiperspirant to work anywhere near as well. Also, this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that, at the recommendation of another reviewer, I switched to an antibacterial soap for use in the shower. However, there have been a few days where I&#x27;ve used deodorant instead of this salt stick and the difference at the end of the day has been noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The [[ASIN:B000B969B4 spray version]] of this stuff does not work anywhere near as well.</li>
    <li> Lasts a VERY long time! Bought this 6 months ago and it barely looks used.  Great natural product that gets the job done.  I use it for daily wear and for when I go to the gym.</li>
    <li> this is the best deodorant. Others use a form of salt (aluminum) but this is the real thing and it last for a really long time! Love this!</li>
    <li> I used a similar deodorant  stone which lasted ten years.  So far this one is easy to apply, and I don&#x27;t stink!  And it will probably be another ten years before I need to buy a new one.- Janet</li>
    <li> The best deodarant you can buy. Very effective. Just put one in your shower area and use it when your armpits are wet daily after shower. You&#x27;ll never need another product that is as effective and safe as this. Should last pretty long as well so very cost effective as well. Any brand of thai Crystal/stone is good because it is the product that works great, nothing specific to the brand.</li>
    <li> This product absolutely does contain aluminum. Why do they say it doesn&#x27;t? From their website: &amp;#34;Alum is a salt. Aluminum is a mineral.&amp;#34; Here&#x27;s what you need to know: alum is a type of salt that has aluminum in it. To say alum has no aluminum is the same as saying table salt has no sodium. Sodium is also a metal, but when you combine it with chlorine (and an electron) and you get sodium chloride, aka table salt. Does your body still absorb the sodium from the table salt? Sure does. Can you imagine if McDonalds advertised their fries as sodium free because they use sodium chloride and not pure sodium? Something you should think about if you&#x27;re trying to avoid aluminum.</li>
    <li> This used to prevent body odor, but now it doesn&#x27;t. In fact, when I took the cover off recently, it smelled itself like body odor...really gross!</li>
    <li> This is like using nothing, I feel like I abused my armpits but it does nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great idea, and maybe it&#x27;s made for a woman and the hair stops it from being effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s made for people who just don&#x27;t ever smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This crystal did not work at all for me. I think it might work for someone who is primarily sedentary, but its surely not an athlete friendly product. I am disappointed to say this as I was very excited after seeing all these positive reviews. But hey, maybe I&#x27;m just a really smelly guy.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Thai Deodorant spray but decided to order the Stone when the spray bottle pump broke. I do like the stone better as there is less waste. Not knowing how long it will last, I don&#x27;t know if the stone is a better value. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not. Still I like the stone application method better than the spray.</li>
    <li> I switched to pit putty, which is a powder at the recommendation of a cousin, and that isn&#x27;t so bad thus far. And given its a powder, that should help you determine how inconvenient putting on this 1 was. It took too long to put on and it doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good idea, but apparently my needs for protection are higher.</li>
    <li> I am trying to go natural.  But I do not want to smell like the zoo.  After a week of using the Amazing Thai crystals, I gave up.  My smell was horrible.  I smelled like someone from Europe that does not use any deodorant,  Asia, from all those crazy countries that like the natural barnyard smell.  I am so pissed I am writing this review.  Why does natural meaning smelling like the packaderm house at the zoo!  All you natural smelling people tell me?  What am I missing here.  Please.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical that its a stone, thinking how can this possibly work? However, after using it I easily have 24hrs protection. I find that it works best if I put it on first thing out of the shower before I dry off so the stone becomes wet. I rub the stick in my armpit probably more than regular deodorant just because it seems like nothing is there. I used to put on regular deodorant two or three times a day and still end up with BO and I&#x27;m not that smelly of a person. I&#x27;m never going back.</li>
    <li> I call this the missionary deodorant. My husband uses it and it does the job. It does last a year and my husband has been using it for years and he does not smell.</li>
    <li> works awesome!! My only issue is my bf used it and is trapped his underarm smell in it haha. Use after shower, before you begin to stink, or it will smell like your stink.</li>
    <li> I bought a few 4.25 oz.Thai Deodorant sticks a couple of years ago. They were made in Thailand.  I&#x27;ve been using them since then because I really liked them. They&#x27;ve been doing a great job.Then I decided to buy a few more of 4.25 oz. Thai Deodorant Sticks for gifts. But this time it said on the container that the product and container were made in China. What was interesting, the Thailand sticks from my first order visually looked much bigger than the China ones from the second order (different Seller).Then I weighed them, after I removed their caps, and sure enough,  the sticks from the first order weighed 141 gr. and China sticks were 126 gr. Not only that. The surfice of the first sticks was smooth like  an ice, and after all this time of my using them, they are still perfectly smooth. But the surface on the second order sticks are all bumpy, not smooth  at all. I don&#x27;t know if they will scratch or not but I already regret buying 5 sticks this time. Also, I can&#x27;t understand how is it possible that both products labeled 4.25 oz. could have such a big difference in weight.</li>
    <li> I tried this years ago and wasn&#x27;t as excited about it, but I really love it now. Absolutely no body odor, but still allows you to perspire normally. I use it under my arms and under my breasts. Great stuff. Unscented, rolls on smoothly when moistened with water, dries quickly.</li>
    <li> If you are going to start the natural deodorant thing do it in the winter so you body can get use to it. I started in the summer and I could literally smell myself.Yuckkk.</li>
    <li> Good price, great product and service.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how effective this stone is against odor.  My spouse and I have been using it for a few weeks now and have found it to be easy to apply and more effective than any other natural option we&#x27;ve tried.  We both prefer this deodorant option to the toxic commercial antiperspirants/deodorants and even the natural options, such as Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  We will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Garbage does not work I smelled like an elephants rear end within a couple hours. Tried toms next also garbage. Back to regular anti prespirants</li>
    <li> Just bought. I love it. It feels like nothing&#x27;s going on you but it eats the odor. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great and no fuss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with thes deo-stick. No harmful chemicals and it works great.</li>
    <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think it would work. When I put it on wetting the stick per the directions, I could still smell body odor, but when the application dried, no BO at all! I switched to this because I started to become allergic to standard deodorant/anti-persperants. I&#x27;ve been using this about a month and no problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 1 mth.  No underarm odor and no perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural.  Make sure you put it on before dressing since having to get it wet before&lt;br /&gt;application. Water drip-page can occur.</li>
    <li> Does the trick, leaves no marks and has absolutely NO fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural fragrance free deodorant for some time now.  This fits the bill.  What more could I want?</li>
    <li> I initially treated this product as a curious novelty. However, I have found it to be amazingly effective! I definitely prefer it over traditional deodorant. It is odorless when applied; I have stayed odor-free even after the sweatiest nights out dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this product for others to try, and i know that they are happy to make the switch as well. At this price, it is worth trying for yourself.</li>
    <li> excellent, natural deodorant!</li>
    <li> I used to use the chemical deodorants until different persons in different countries told me about how harmful chemical deodorants are for your health and to use this. And this particular brand.  I was nervous at first.  So, when I started to put it, I constantly had to ask someone &amp;#34;am I smelling? I am asking because I just changed deodorants.&amp;#34;  And I was told no. So I grew confident.  Now, this is all I use.  at first, I used to use the way the instructions say, wet the stone and then use it. But one of my friends told me to use it as soon as I come out of the shower before I use the towel. I find it to be much faster, and convenient.  I purchased a number of them for family as gifts. It also lasts for a long time.  I honestly, honestly recommend it.  You will feel it and your body will let you know it is happy.  Also, the company that sells it is very professional, the item arrived quickly.  I was very pleased with the whole experience.</li>
    <li> very good... No stinky armpits any more...</li>
    <li> Only way to go...only thing that works (for me).  Good for a days protection against BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little inconvenient to apply, as you need to get it wet under the faucet first, but the results speak for itself, and you don&#x27;t have the sticky slimy feel of your conventional deodorants.</li>
    <li> I tried this a few times and only the very first time, did the deod dry good under my arms. i tried several times using different amounts of water and all times it seemed to just leave my armpits a little sticky. I also had to reapply several times when temps were only in the 70&#x27;s. Can&#x27;t imagine using it when we are in the 100&#x27;s. Looking for different natural products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item per the suggestion of some fora on acne control. In conjunction with my B5 regimen, salic acid cleansing, and now the alum stick, my acne has been under control. One might ask if the deodorant stick actually did anything or if the other products carried to cure; those products did indeed help tremendously, but the stick was added more than 2 months after starting on said products. It seems to have help stop the spreading of the acne. One very noticeable cause by the deodorant stick was it&#x27;s ability to leave me feeling less sticky throughout the days on the applied areas- in my case, face, chest, shoulders, and upper abdominal region. Even at the gym I was much less prone to the stickiness one would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of this all, it&#x27;s working like a charm as a an underarm deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. It was cheap enough for me to take a risk and I&#x27;m glad for it.</li>
    <li> This product must be made wet to use. I found this to be a bit inconvenient, so I went back to a less eco friendly product.  Too bad!</li>
    <li> Applied according to instructions and it did not work for me. Glad I tried it though because I am on a quest to find a natural deodorant that actually works. So far the best I&#x27;ve used is the JK Naturals Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree, but even that only works for a few hours, smells like wet cardboard &amp; peppermint and is outrageously expensive.</li>
    <li> Been using these for 20 years. No harmful chemicals and they work.</li>
    <li> Product works well but halfway through the stick the stick start to fall out of the container</li>
    <li> Never use anything else</li>
    <li> This is hands down the greatest deodorant that I have ever experienced. I have used every type of deodorant from every major brand of deodorant in the stores, every clinical protection, and even a couple of prescription strength ones too; nothing can hold a candle to the Thai Deodorant Stone. I apply this product extremely liberally all over my upper body, yes my whole upper body not just under my arms.  I use it on my chest, stomach, under arm, sides, inside of bicep, I&#x27;ve even used it on my traps. The thing is that the body has oil and sweat glands all over which means you can stink more places than just under your arms. Now if you just read that and thought &amp;#34;oh no that&#x27;s too much!&amp;#34;, WRONG. The ingredients are &amp;#34;mineral salts&amp;#34;... that&#x27;s it.  One thing I hate about other deodorants is that they blend with body odor and just make a horrible perfumy funk... and it&#x27;s disgusting. The thai stick doesn&#x27;t smell, and it doesn&#x27;t try to &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; body odor, it kills it.  I bought my stick on August 12, 2011 and I use it every single day, usually twice a day (early morning, evening after I shower), and as mentioned I apply it liberally over my upper body and I still haven&#x27;t had to buy a replacement stick! This thing works better than anything you will EVER find, and it lasts like 50x&#x27;s longer! Buy it, use it, love it.  UPDATE: I bought my last Thai Stick in March (9-10 months ago), and I&#x27;m replacing it now not because it&#x27;s gone, but just so I have another one available. I still apply this 2-3 times a day (depending on if I go to the gym etc). I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it, it just prevents the bacteria that hang onto sweat and cause body odor. So, if you&#x27;re a penny pincher, concerned about the chemicals you&#x27;re exposing your body to, or just want something that ACTUALLY WORKS, buy the Thai Stick. It&#x27;s unbelievable!  Update 2: I feel obligated to return here and mention that I&#x27;m ordering yet another stick... but again, not because I ran out. In fact of the handful I&#x27;ve ordered, I&#x27;ve never ran one out. I inevitably drop the stone and it breaks into a million pieces. I could still use the remnants, but jagged salt is really uncomfortable. I might just order like 5, and have deodorant on hand for the next 4 years.</li>
    <li> Love my Thai deodarant stick. Other deodarants don&#x27;t work for my and this one lasts for years and years.All natural!!</li>
    <li> This is a solid pillar of hard salt with the top rounded off so there aren&#x27;t any jagged or sharp edges to scrape your underarms. You simply wet the stick under the faucet, then apply as you would any other solid deodorant. It keeps you odor-free for hours and hours, and then some. There is no dangerous chemicals, and no fragrance to conflict with whatever scent you may wear. I love not having the nasty stick deodorant residue to deal with on my clothes or skin. This is a deodorant, not antiperspirant, so if you perspire quite a lot visibly, you may just want to wear this around the house, at least to see how it works for you personally first perspiration-wise to be sure how it will work in that way. So far, I have not had any problems with it, but each individual&#x27;s body is different. However, this does a great job at keeping you smelling fresh and odor-free, I think better than regular deodorants. This brand also makes a pump spray (liquid) if you prefer it, which can alternatively be used for foot odor issues. However, for me, I love the Thai Deodorant Stick, and it lasts for such a very long time, MONTHS, before you have to buy another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my deodorant stone for more than half a year now and I&#x27;ve still got quite a bit left (a little less than half). Granted, I don&#x27;t use it every day, but only on occasions when I think I&#x27;m going to need it. I don&#x27;t have terrible body odor so I can&#x27;t say how effective it is for those who do, but I tend to sweat a lot during the hot summer months, or in the winter time when I&#x27;m wearing stuffy sweaters and going back forth between the cold outdoors and the warm indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, simply wet the stone and apply generously to your DRY underarms! It&#x27;s important that your armpits are dry because it won&#x27;t be very effective otherwise. This is why many people prefer to apply it after they shower. But I apply it both after I shower and once again in the morning before I go out. If you touch the skin (once it&#x27;s dried) where you&#x27;ve applied the stone to, you&#x27;ll notice a velvety feel to it. This means that the stone is working because it is drying up the area and killing the bacteria that causes your armpits to stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice that this product is only a deodorant, so it will not stop you from regularly sweating. If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t sweat a lot, it might be worth investing in. If you want to cease/ slow the sweating or if you&#x27;re going on a date, you might want to keep a tube of anti-perspirant deodorant handy. For me, this product has not been fool-proof. It doesn&#x27;t always work as well as I&#x27;d like it to, but I use it because it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients and won&#x27;t clog up your pores. I also heard that it can be used on other parts of the body, but I have not tried. But since it&#x27;s just salt, it probably won&#x27;t hurt to try :)</li>
    <li> I have had great success with this, but follow these tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)don&#x27;t use if you have razor burn! Take a deoderant vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)dont wait too long after your shower or bath. Bacteria grows fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)i have found that I can smell a little  BO when wearing sleeveless shirts, but I think this is probably due to residues in my tanks and it&#x27;s right up there in my pit sweat! Washing with vinegar in the rinse cycle may help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)take your time; make sure you get all of the area of your pit that will close against skin when your arm is down. AND LET IT DRY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)clean your pits well!! Don&#x27;t just use a handful of soap. Get a scrubby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry around Tom&#x27;s deoderant for a &#x27;just in case&#x27; moment. I had to use it a couple times while razor burn was healing, but I HATED it after using the salt crystal. Even if you sweat, it&#x27;s meant to evaporate and it&#x27;s not something your body notices all the time. When you go back to slimy deoderants, YUCK! My pits bothered me the whole time because I could feel the slime. I actually washed it off and went deoderant free for the rest of my healing and I didn&#x27;t smell too bad anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for any arguments for it containing aluminum...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alum is a compound made of sulphur (sulfite), aluminium, and potassium (hydrated potassium aluminium sulfite- which is not aluminum) Just like pure oxygen is deadly and pure hydrogen is deadly...mix them together...WATER! I don&#x27;t know if alum is in this crystal (its in The Crystal), but it is the naturally occurring alum. Man has made alums from other chemicals like ammonia, but that&#x27;s not what you would find here.</li>
    <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right its a great little deodorant does the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Axe and Old Spice for almost 10 years and never was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wanted to give a try and I bought two of these. Now guess what, I&#x27;m totally happy with the product and the best part is these are &amp;#34;CHEMICAL FREE&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However there is a small problem though, the stick comes out of the cap after few uses and you will have to hold the rock with hand other than this its still an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you guys.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived as expected, made in Thailand. Lot 113014 Use by 8/15/2029. Over 15million sold, etc.  I previously had the one in the basket but I dropped it. It only cracked, but that crack turned into the Grand Canyon over time. That one now sits on my sink to help prevent slippery fingers while shaving. This stick version with the plastic base is easier to use, has a tight cap to prevent premature wear, and tastes just as good  (you know you&#x27;ve tasted it, too). &amp;#34;Paraben free.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s pretty-well stuck into that plastic base. The top twists-on snugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My typical usage is to wet my pits after a shower, and rub the alum all over my pits/underarms/sides. Then I shave, and the product has dried by then. I take some talc in my hands and rub it on my pits to help with dampness. Then I rub my hands on my feet to remove the excess talc, and put on my merino wool dress socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I briskly walk to the train, and to work, and back again. I do get some dampness (under-shirt helps with that), but no odor through the evening. The next morning there is some odor but, eh, shower time. The temp is low 90F at the moment. No issues. Coworkers have not told me I smell like a caveman.  Besides, no smell is better that that &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; deodorant smell, nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I buy new dress shirts I will test if rubbing the alum on my neck helps to prevent yellow collars. It seems like it helps to prevent crusty areas in my t-shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to removing the stains left on my arms from antiperspirants, I&#x27;m going to say that this alum has helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I used this for the past 25yrs of my life since puberty, as opposed to xxx brand with aluminium leeching into my body.</li>
    <li> I would have given this stick of deodorant 5 stars if only it could also cure cancer. Fortunately, it does just about everything else. I had been using Dove for Men: Deodorant and Anti-Perspirant for about the last year and my biggest complaint is how quickly I go through one. When my last one finally ran out I came to Amazon to search for a better solution. I stumbled upon Thai Stick after being inspired by my girlfriend to use natural products on my body. Review after review I saw people comment on how one stick would often last a year. I read a few other reviews that explained that the ingredients used to fight perspiration was one of the primary causes of discoloration. Since Thai Stick is all natural it wouldn&#x27;t cause the same discoloration. Despite these obvious benefits, I live in Houston where you begin sweating the second you step outside because of the intense humidity. You can imagine how hesitant I was to switch to a stick without an anti-perspirant. I simply had to convince myself that perspiration is natural and necessary to cool the body off, right?! So I took a leap of faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for less than a month and have been beyond impressed! I have followed other advice to wet the stick prior to applying and have had no issues with it \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; my skin. Surprisingly, it works just as well as my old anti-perspirant and I have yet to find myself emitting any unpleasant B.O. In fact, I sometime check myself at the end of the day to see if it is really working as well as I make it out to be in my head. As for the discoloration to my shirts, I haven&#x27;t had much time to test this. I&#x27;ll try to update this review in a few months after I can test this on some new undershirts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of salt deodorants over the years and I&#x27;d have to say this one is about average.  It does the trick for about the first half of the day, but then you have to re-apply.  Some of the better brands last all day.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used! Clean, odorless, effective, and really works!! For those with heavy odor, this is your best solution to great scent!! :-)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s a natural way to keep dry and smell good.  No chemicals to be absorbed into the skin.  I&#x27;ll never go back to regular deodorant again!!!</li>
    <li> I followed other customer application suggestions and have been happy with this product.  It feels different, I feel a little sticky without the old gel coating but I do not sweat through clothes.  I needed deodorant every day and this is my new daily deodorant.  I have used it for a month now and have never smelled bad or been wet under the arms.  I scrub clean in the shower and then apply liberally to the entire underarm.</li>
    <li> I think this is magic. Tried 3 days so far and my pits don&#x27;t stink. I just don&#x27;t get it. If this doesn&#x27;t stain your undershirts as it suggests, I&#x27;ll never wear the old stuff again.</li>
    <li> I love this item so much that I purchased 7 more to give to family members! I was looking for a natural deodorant since I breastfeed and felt horribly about using regular deodorant knowing of all the harmul ingredients in them and didn&#x27;t want my baby inhaling toxins or consuming them through my milk. I&#x27;m glad I finally did the switch &amp; I will never go back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stop you from sweating...I still seem to have my hormones out of whack post pregnancy so on some days I start sweating like crazy even in AC...but this keeps me fresh...sometimes I reapply halfway through the day just incase. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it still looks brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using his for a month also and loves it. He is very athletic and sweats a lot. I used to tell him to leave his basketball clothes outside after he came home because they would be drenched (every inch) and funky lol. But now he plays wearing this deodorant and sweats just the same...but no more funk lol. No more stained shirts either. This product is great!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about using this product. I have been looking for an alternative to the deodorants with aluminum, but none of the ones I had tried worked. I read about this one, and how good it works, from a writer that I follow. It works as promised! I have been using it for about a month now, and have been amazed. It does not, however, keep you from perspiring. Even so, I don&#x27;t expect that I&#x27;ll be using anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> great stuff here. i used during marathon training and its aeesome!!!!</li>
    <li> Favorite deodorant because it is 100% natural and it does the job without adding aluminum to my body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used  this product for several months now and I can&#x27;t complain.  It is definitely not an antiperspirant, which it doesn&#x27;t claim to be.  It very much works at deodorizing me for the day, depending on my stress, diet and activity.  I&#x27;m glad to find it as I don&#x27;t want to be exposed to and absorbing all the aluminum containing products.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and love it!  No issues with this vendor; arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I have used Thai deodorant stones for years. It is very convienent in this holder, it does a great job and it last forever!</li>
    <li> It works pretty well, does not contain a lot of - if any- synthetic chemicals, but do understand, it does contain aluminum, though in a salt compound. It&#x27;s too bad they appear not to be compelled to spell out the specific &#x27;mineral salts&#x27; in the ingredients list. While there is no proven link between applying aluminum compounds to your skin daily and, say, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, if your goal is to move away from aluminum contact, I would say this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the effort to go more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;. I knew going in that this probably wouldn&#x27;t keep me from sweating, since there&#x27;s nothing to block the pores, but I figure I should mention that to make sure readers are aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works perfectly! On cooler days, there&#x27;s no BO and no sweat. Now that summer is coming around, I definitely notice that I&#x27;m getting a little sweaty - but there&#x27;s still no BO! And when I do sweat, my clothes aren&#x27;t getting gross and stained like they do with regular deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful putting this on right after shaving - it stings!</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well and feels very natural.  No white stuff on your clothes and lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> Love the concept but I didn&#x27;t feel it worked that well after a few times. Maybe it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have lavender or test tree which is microbial and breaks odor. Not sure</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic i don&#x27;t think this works. I have tried it for my self to see if it works. I would recommend you save your money on this.</li>
    <li> I use this straight out of the shower and no odor whatsoever! I simply wet the top of the stick and apply. I love that it goes on clear so I don&#x27;t have to worry about any residue on my shirts.  Also I haven&#x27;t had to reapply throughout the day. I don&#x27;t sweat too much but have used this before a workout and I did not have an odor afterwards. Love this stuff wish I had found this years ago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a deodorant to hold up throughout the day since middle school and I am almost amazed at how well this odorless/transparent product works. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would do much when my mom told me she ordered it but it really does! I have tried so many different brands of deodorant. The one that worked the best for me was Secret Platinum but several years back it was discontinued (I assume because I never see it anymore). After that I kept switching brands until I could find one that works and none of them did! Before my mom ordered the Thai stone I was at the point where I was using two different deodorants. I did some research and found that it might have been the deodorant that was causing the odor and that people should actually avoid using it unless they sweat a lot (which I don&#x27;t). The compounds in deodorant actually feed the bacteria that is causing you to have BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after a couple of days I already noticed the difference with the Thai Stone. The key is to coat your entire armpit not just where you grow hair. I was nervous about not wearing deodorant at work for the first time but the thai stone held up for me perfectly despite that I do a lot of walking, bending, and consistently moving at my job. I cannot believe or say enough good things about this product. I use it once every day in the shower but right before I get out. It has eliminated the BO completely, something that I had a definite problem with before. I&#x27;m really excited about the thai stone and cannot believe I haven&#x27;t seen this in more places, because more people who struggle with embarrassing body odor should know about it!</li>
    <li> what a crazy product. couldn&#x27;t be more happy. totally works, and I can stink fast. used for several days and it is such a miracle product, don&#x27;t be scared to try it. make sure it says product of thailand</li>
    <li> PRO: Very good fighting perspiration. Just wet with cold water and apply.&lt;br /&gt;CON: The alumn jiggles in the holder as it gets consumed. Does not fall though.</li>
    <li> Who knew this would work -- seems like something out of the world of crystal healing to be used under New Age music -- but I find this product highly effective, and unlike most other deodorants, this has for me been totally non-irritating.  It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing either.  It must go on wet, and since it&#x27;s not a gel nor applied with a propellant, it takes a few extra seconds to use.  Most readily applied while still damp after a shower, spread it over a relatively broad area in your axillae; I find that if I spend an extra fifteen seconds under each arm, it remains effective as long or even much longer than conventional products, and I mean even when I am out exercising in hot humid weather for hours, profusely perspiring. My impression -- with, of course no science behind is -- is that using this over time increases its effectiveness, perhaps because it eliminates some of the odiferous microbiome under the arms (or I could just be making that up).  It also seems to take forever to use up, lasting some order of magnitude longer than conventional products.  One warning:  do not drop it on a hard surface or the crystal might fracture into an unusable jagged mountain range,  The one and only notable deficiency is that the screw-on cap doesn&#x27;t always hold as well as it should over time.  But that&#x27;s not enough of a problem to lose a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note:  This is probably not the right product for your brief case or carry-on travel bag since it only goes on wet and weighs a little more than a gel (or roll-on). There might still be a place in life for all those other annoying products.</li>
    <li> All expectation were met</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BOMB.  I&#x27;ve always had difficulty controlling my AO (armpit odor), but when I use Thai Crystal Stones, I have no problem.  Plus, I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about aluminum or other harmful chemical ingredients!</li>
    <li> Spouse and I swear by the Thai deodorant stone. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Thai Deodorant stick because I was curious if it really works and I was tired of my undershirts and T-shirts getting that yucky conventional stick anti-perspirant/deodorant residue in the armpit area. Also wanted to see if it would help keep the foot funk away from my socks and work shoes (bought a separate one at a local store for that purpose). I apply it when I get out of the shower before I go to work in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: My new undershirts show no signs of residue - yet. Using it on my feet made quite a difference - my shoes, socks, and feet have a marked reduction in odor compared to before using a older pair of shoes that got funked up. Wearing new(er) non-funky smelling shoes, my socks and feet smell more like the inside of the shoe itself, no hint of foot odor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not-so-good: Since this does not prevent perspiration, I do detect a hint of odor at the end of the day. Mind you, the smell is in the part of the fabric that absorbed the sweat - can&#x27;t really detect any from the armpits directly. Pretty much have to hold it up to your nose to smell it. If you have someone willing to do a sniff test for you, by all means do so and report your findings! Still, it is slightly worrisome if I sweat profusely since I&#x27;m wondering if others can smell it should they get close enough, like standing in the bus during a commute or working in close quarters. I, for one, do not want to be \\&quot;that (smelly) guy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though not \\&quot;perfect\\&quot;, I am generally pleased with this product and intend to use it regularly until someone tells me it&#x27;s not working.</li>
    <li> Love not having wavy metals and chemicals on my skin</li>
    <li> Excellent deodorant stone, especially when I am traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base provides excellent grip so I don&#x27;t drop it when it is wet and slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very much improved design from when your salt crystal stones used to come in a plastic bag as a standalone &amp;#34;rock&amp;#34;, which inevitably slipped out of my hands and created jagged edges with which to subject my underarms to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this version of Thai Deodorant Stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I haven&#x27;t used store bought deodorant in nearly a year. Easy to apply and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!! I purchased this in 2009 but just started using it. I noticed that when I played basketball even after just taking a shower my normal deodorant wasn&#x27;t doing the Job at all. So I decided to test this product I took a shower the night before and applied this deodorant. I went to play basketball the next day around 11:30am with out taking another preshower. After playing there was No smell I couldn&#x27;t believe it. So I tried it the next day, one again no smell, NONE!&lt;br /&gt;I guess the salt neutralizes the bacteria that causes smell. What ever it is it wonderful and all natural no chemicals. I would like someone to read this and prove me wrong I would be interested in the experience of others. As for now I am going to buy one for my whole family.</li>
    <li> Should have known about this product years ago!</li>
    <li> I am trying to get all of the toxins out of my house and stop using chemical products inside or on my body. I bought this because it has so many great reviews.  Perhaps it has to do with body chemistry, but this did nothing for me. I might has well not have been using deodorant at all! Yes, I wet the stick and yes I applied a ton all over my armpits and let it dry. I used it for 3 days before I finally decided it was better off in the trash than in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
    <li> I ordered this October 18, 2013, and it&#x27;s been more than a year and a half and I&#x27;m still using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well, with this deodorant you have to apply it in the morning and after you take a shower. If you&#x27;ve worked up a sweat, this product won&#x27;t mask the odor 100%, but no one should be able to smell your BO. As for a natural cheap chemical free product, this is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about the aluminum in the product. This product is a salt, hydrated potassium aluminium sulfate, when a salt is dissolved in water (which is what you do when you run it under the fosset before you run it on, and also when you sweat), the salt breaks into its ions ( it breaks up into potassium, aluminum, and sulfate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that when you&#x27;re applying this to your underarms, you&#x27;re exposing yourself to aluminum. I&#x27;ve heard that aluminum is bad for you, so ideally I should minimize undue exposure to aluminum. This means also not cooking acidic foods (I also heard salted foods) in aluminum. Acid dissolves aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might just be applying baking soda powder to my underarms</li>
    <li> If you want early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s and a lowered immune system, then by all means spread 61% Alum on your body every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the label doesn&#x27;t tell you exactly what is in the product. That is a huge red flag!  The company faxed me their ingredients and lo and behold it contains 61% &#x27;potassium alum&#x27; which is aluminum, which is toxic to the body.  They claim the crystals are too large to be absorbed but they provide ZERO scientific evidence that this is the case.  (I had to get them to fax ingredients because they sneakily omit the ingredients from their label!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; google the following words \\&quot;Mercola aluminum lurks deodorant&#x27; and see what Dr Mercola, MD has to say about these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label on the product is so misleading! Another red flag! It says &#x27;contains no aluminum chlorhydrate&#x27;, as if that is the only form of aluminum to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aluminum is extremely toxic and is absorbed by the skin. They say it isn&#x27;t absorbed but then how do they think it blocks the pores on your skin?  By magic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this product at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Yes it works, why? Because it&#x27;s made of aluminium crystals (or Alum). It&#x27;s no better health wise than your regular old stick of Degree. The manufacturers cleverly omit an list ingredients on the packaging but if you do your research, you will learn of the aluminium crystal content. Products manufactured overseas have very little health and safety codes so there&#x27;s no telling what else is in this stick of deodorant. You could well be spreading some serious toxins onto your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are claims that Alum crystals cannot be absorbed into the skin because of there molecular size which is just completely unproven. Molecular makeup changes upon becoming wet (you have to wet this stick to use it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want a better / much cheaper solution? Fill a spray bottle with Milk of Magnesia and you won&#x27;t have further underarm problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give the Thai Deoderant Stick a try.  I live in a very hot and humid state that really put this product to the test! I wish I had heard about a long time ago; it is fantastic and completely controls odor.  It works on odors caused by nervous perspiration as well as heat-induced perspiration, all day and all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait as long as I did to try the Thai Stick; it is worth every penny and more.</li>
    <li> This deodorant will NOT stop wetness. It will, however, stop odor, and it won&#x27;t stain your clothes like the sticks and gels and sprays do. It lasts a long long time - my first stone lasted almost 2 years, even though I dropped it and part of it broke off. If that happens to you, and it&#x27;s too sharp to use, just file down the jagged edges with sandpaper or a nail file. The stone works best if you use it twice a day, morning and night. I recommend this stone to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant my husband has used for years now. He has no allergic problems yet has the best odor control with this product...</li>
    <li> Works great and is fragrance free.  One deodorant stone lasts a long time.  Just be careful not to drop it on a hard floor as it will break and then you end up with jagged edges that will scrape your skin when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who isn&#x27;t familiar with this product, be aware that this is a deodorant product.  It is NOT an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this product for about twenty years and will never use anything else.  It prevents odor even in the hottest situations.  I&#x27;ve done volunteer work on construction sites in the heat of summer and this never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know people who also use it on their feet to prevent smelly feet.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I bought my first one just about a year ago, but this has never let me down.  I had been using antiperspirant deodorant for my entire life, and shirt after shirt continued to get stained over time.  Since I started using this, the stains stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stains stopped and odor is slightly less noticeable than with the traditional stick; most of this depends on how much time I take to spread this around.  It&#x27;s best to spread all around the area, and if you have time, I recommend trying to let the underarms dry as much as possible before putting a shirt on.  Typically at the gym I&#x27;ll use this, then do the rest of the morning routine before the shirt comes on.  12 months later, I have had no issues, and I&#x27;m on just my second (after a drop) stick.  These last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dropped mine a couple of times. The first, it was cracked to the point of unusability and I bought a new one.  More recently on the replacement, just a minor dent, still very functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using crystal deodorant sticks for over 20 years. Not only do they work better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, but they also don&#x27;t stain your clothes! No white residue nor yellowish stains on white clothing, no discoloration of any kind. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a  more tedious than an already liquid deodorant as you have to wet it and rub it on for a few seconds to make it work really well. I will be trying their liquid version.</li>
    <li> I tried this deodorant recently when a friend recommended it. I&#x27;ve tried a TON of aluminum-free/natural deodorants: Tom&#x27;s, Crystal, Dermalogica, Kiss My Face, Arm and Hammer, etc. -- I&#x27;ve literally tried dozens in the pursuit of finding one that actually works. This one does! I live in Texas where we have warm, humid summers. Even after sweating all day, I still have no odor. None. Even the next day, there is no detectable odor. Since discovering this deodorant, I will not use anything else. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t prevent sweating, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Hands down this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing. Like the other reviews say it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant so it doesn&#x27;t stop the sweating. But I do think compared to the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used, I definitely noticed significantly less sweating and almost no stink. There was only one day that at the end of the day I noticed a little stink. It&#x27;s summer and where I live it&#x27;s over for 100 degrees every day.</li>
    <li> Got rid of my father under arm odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this product but what made me gave it a second look is because of the name of the brand. I was from Thailand and this stone is quite popular as a deodorant and super cheap in Thailand. This is a form of Aluminium crystral (KAl(SO4)2.12H2O), so anyone who love this product because it&#x27;s all natural... DUHH. Actually it is chemical and is synthesized, not dig from the ground or anything. Also, most Thai people know that using this Aluminium crystral for a long period will cause your underarms to be darker in color.</li>
    <li> I have searched and tried MANY different natural deodorants. I have no idea how this works, as it feels like I have nothing on, but it is BY FAR the best natural deodorant I have tried. No stink at the end of the day! I wet it twice and apply liberally. My only complaint is I have dropped it twice and have to order a new one each time. It&#x27;s kind of a bad combo with having to wet it and having a smooth plastic place to hold onto - wish it was a better grip. But it&#x27;s worth it to have such a great product. I now just make sure I have an extra on hand just in case I get clumsy. ;)</li>
    <li> My son uses this and told me about it. I bought and used for the first time while on vacation in a tropical area (very warm) It does not keep you from sweating but there is no smell at all. The key is to put it on right out of the shower before you start sweating because once you start the bacteria start to form and that is what causes the smell. I will never use regular deodorant again . As for the sweat it does not bother me...its normal!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve used it for the past several years after developing an allergy to the aluminins in regular deodorant.</li>
    <li> The deodorant stone crystal works!!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I must say this is not as effective as other brands. Overall I think it&#x27;s ok, it prevents from smelling like for a couple hours, but for the whole day you need something better. I bought it along with travel sticks from other brand and they are way better and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this one for a friend who doesn&#x27;t smell as much as I do and she&#x27;s satisfied.</li>
    <li> OK, first thing you&#x27;d notice is that it looks kind of strange because we are not used to real goodness, has a nature provided alum salt chemical composition, round stick, odorless, colorless and toxin free and works extremely well. What? Do you still need more? OK then keep reading...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy, I do not really care about smelling that great as long as I don&#x27;t stink really, well maybe I do a little bit because I like colognes too. I started having an irritation to all the mass produced toxic junk deodorants that you will find in any department store. Then I was kind of forced to look into alternatives. I remember a long time ago a friend of mine had shown me a weird looking stone, he said it is a deodorant, all natural salts. At that time I could not care less, so I forgot about it the very next day, I was happy poisoning myself with the regular deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, after all these years of abuse, my armpits threw the towel and said that&#x27;s it, I am done smearing that junk on my face. So then I thought I&#x27;d try this, and I must say I have never looked back. And I will also tell you what, if I had not dropped it a few times, I&#x27;d probably go on for a couple of years with one single purchase, yes you read me right, COUPLE OF YEARS....!! How do you like them apples Ha?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion from personal experience I have is that you need to apply it on a large surface area beyond the main area. And make sure you hold the stick tight after shower, there is every possibility you will drop it a few times like I did, which means it might break on you. But then you can still keep the broken parts and keep using them, or just get the wide stick, I think it will grip better and that is what I am planning to go with my next couple of years of armpit happiness investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are smart and have a stedy head on your shoulders, you will drop your current poison in the trash as soon as you are done reading this review. Take your armpit&#x27;shealth into your own hands, :-) and live well my friend! Now is the time to switch!</li>
    <li> This sucks. I tried it for a week and I stank for a week. I thought about maybe waiting a little while longer but my job involves me being in close contact with other people and I just couldn&#x27;t be that stinky person or I would lose clients.</li>
    <li> I like it, I do find myself having to reapply.  It works really well UNDER deodorant though or in other areas of the body.  I also like that the stick doesn&#x27;t seem to get as musky from being wet as a couple others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years as it is the only one I don&#x27;t itch from but after a short time the smell is back. I don&#x27;t think any natural deodorant works more than a few hours. If you don&#x27;t sweat a lot or live in a cold climate then maybe it will work. Not if you live in a hot climate a year long. I keep using it since it&#x27;s a little bit better than nothing. If I just shower I&#x27;m good to go for a few hours without deodorant. With the stone it adds maybe an extra hour. I have given up ever finding anything that either doesn&#x27;t irritate under the arms like tea tree oil or  just prevents odor during a normal working day.  My husband says it does nothing, my brothers and sisters and friends have had no luck. It&#x27;s hopeless.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every natural deodorant out there</li>
    <li> I originally purchased one of these from A health food co-op. I called the company because I noticed that the product did not seem to be getting any smaller after a couple of months. I figured I must not be using it correctly, however the custumer service rep assured me it was normal to last for quite a while. Seems to work really well too. So, Again, I&#x27;m really amazed with this THAI Crystal. I hope they will consider coming out with a Thai Crystal car that would eliminate any need for maintenance...</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrific, effective and easy to use.  It goes on clean and kills oder.  I keep a jar of water to dip it in in my walk in closet where I dress.&lt;br /&gt;Thai Deodorant Stone Crystal-Deodorant, 4.25...</li>
    <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve ruined several nice white shirts with armpit stains due to the aluminum in every darn deodorant on the market.  So I decided to revisit the &amp;#34;deodorant stone&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ll never ruin another $100 white shirt again (or a $10 white shirt for that matter).  If this thing lasts as long as the stone I had 20 years ago, I&#x27;ll be fine for the next year or two at least.  It&#x27;s conveniently contained in a little &amp;#34;deodorant-like&amp;#34; hard case.  Just wet under the faucet and rub like deodorant under your arm.  I usually wet it a few times and apply really, really liberally all over my underarms and even arms and sides.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is happening, but it is...trust me. I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively now for a few months and have had no issues with any sort of stink.  Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been working out like crazy, so I&#x27;m drenched in sweat 3-5 times a week...still no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never, ever going to buy another $5.99 stick of deodorant again, for the rest of my life.  If you need the fragrant smell of deodorant, buy some cologne or some body spray and toss your old deodorant.  Get this product.  You&#x27;ll be happier and save soooo much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up: I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years now and still love it. I&#x27;m on my third order, so they actually last about a year + of daily, liberal use. No sweat stains on shirts, no stink, easy, dave money. What else I there to know?</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2.5 years now, and it is the only deodorant I will ever use. I&#x27;m sure the regular old speedsticks are fine and not chemically harmful, but I like the crystal stick for multiple reasons. 1) No funky residue that feels weird or discolors clothes. I sweat profusely, and all my clothes from high school had a nasty brownish yellow discoloration from my anti-perspirant wearing days. Plus whenever I go camping or go to Mexico where I am not guaranteed a shower for a week, reapplying the crystal is no problem whereas other stick deodorant just keeps building up until you have a disgusting layer of stickiness. 2) It actually WORKS. For most effective use, I apply it right after my shower. As other reviewers have noted before, applying it over a large area increases efficacy. It&#x27;s not meant to mask smells, so use this with the idea that it&#x27;s meant for prevention of odor. 3) Safe to use on other smelly areas: feet, crotch, you name it. Just don&#x27;t use it for bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time I accidentally left this at my parents house and ended up getting a Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand stick deodorant. I am sensitive to smells, and the overpowering aroma of lavender (which I like, I just don&#x27;t like it following me everywhere) left me missing my crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working on the farm, riding my bike to school daily, roughing it for a few day in the woods, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this product is fragrance and aluminum chlorhydrate-free, and for me it works quite effectively. But I have now broken two of these sticks, and there is no putting these Humpty Dumpties back together again. Granted, my arthritic hands don&#x27;t grasp things as well as they used to, but much of the problem has to do with the length and weight of the stone relative to the plastic base. It&#x27;s simply hard to hold, and if you&#x27;re using it while standing on a tile floor in the bathroom . . . well, bye-bye deodorant stone. A push-up or twist-up container would work much better, and if I&#x27;m not mistaken this type of design may be on the market now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, these sticks do contain atoms of aluminum, but since it is essentially ubiquitous in the environment (aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth&#x27;s crust, following only oxygen and silicon) you&#x27;re probably not going to avoid it unless you live in a bubble.</li>
    <li> Great product, but they need to figure out how to keep it from falling out of the plastic holder.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item on an everyday basis for about the past two months and have come to the conclusion that it just simply is not effective enough for me. There was not a single day where I applied this and felt like I was safe from bad stenches. I would often times be at work and catch a whiff of something bad, and sure enough, it was me even though this would occur less than 5 hours after applying it initially. The process to apply this is too messy for me to bring it to work and reapply. I will say that while it didn&#x27;t satisfy my needs to not smell bad, it did succeed in helping me not have pit stains on my undershirts. I just wish it was more effective in every other regard.</li>
    <li> At first, I bought the brick Thai deodorant and LOVED IT. But, after dropping it a few times it began to chip and scrape my armpit.&lt;br /&gt;I waited a while and reluctantly tried this form factor... It&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m not a huge proponent of the &amp;#34;plastic revolution&amp;#34; and I felt better about my first purchase in that regard BUT this deodorant has outlasted 5 Toms brand and probably 3 name brand deodorants and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve actually worn any down! So... It&#x27;s worth it morally, it&#x27;s worth it financially and most importantly it WORKS! You don&#x27;t smell flowery but you don&#x27;t smell... at all. Buy it. You&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> Excelent product it helps to avoid bad odors&lt;br /&gt;If coud buy it. Do it&lt;br /&gt;Cost vs benefits is perfect fir me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to aluminum-based antiperspirants for a while now, and nothing has managed to be all-day-worthy: until now. I&#x27;m truly impressed with how well this stuff works.</li>
    <li> Bought this more than a year ago (just checked my order history) and after daily use I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent in it.  WOW!  But more importantly.....IT TRULY WORKS!  I walk the dog 3+ miles a day and workout at the gym more days than not.  Yes, I will smell but only slightly and only after more than an hour of VERY INTENSE workouts.  Plus, the smell is faint and localized i.e., I&#x27;m not making enemies at the gym.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have posted the success of this product is mostly dependent on the application.  I wet the stone and blot off the excess water just so the stone will slide across my skin.  I apply it liberally --- all around the armpit and into my upper arm a bit as well as down my side too.  I sometimes go over it twice....point being that 100% coverage is key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when you try this product give yourself about a week to make the adjustment.  Your body will &#x27;clear out&#x27; from the chemicals of mainstream deos and the stone will work.  But for the first week I felt like it was sort of a detox or transition period (a little stinky the first day or so) but then the stone kicked in and it has been working ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  I bought the smaller stone just for travels (it&#x27;s lighter weight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No white messes.  No chemicals to feel guilty about.  It dries quickly.  VERY ECONOMICAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly feel that all products should be this simple and straightforward!</li>
    <li> I originally bought my first stone in 2009 which lasted me until 2013. I&#x27;ve been using it daily since. No one notices I&#x27;m using this. The stone is fragrance free and helps me stay fragrance free...</li>
    <li> After so many years of using chemical laden deodorant, I was intrigued by the Thai Stone which is nothing but mineral salt. Skeptical, I ordered one and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since because it works so well! It&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant but it goes on wet, dries quickly and I&#x27;m not aware of sweating or odor for the rest of the day. My husband has also switched to the Thai Stone and is very satisfied, and I am so happy not to smell those horrible concoctions mainstream deodorant companies conjure up, like \\&quot;ocean breeze\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh scent\\&quot; -- fragrance that just adds perfume to body odor which makes an icky smelling combo in my opinion. My teenage son has been using it and I haven&#x27;t detected any body odor, but he has asked for something stronger, so he&#x27;s comparing a few and maybe it&#x27;s not for everyone. But it works for me and my husband, and I think it&#x27;s a great find! Plus, it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Solid product that does what it says--but don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking it is an antiperspirant because it is not.  For wetness, I have a prescription from my dermatologist called Drysol that I apply only once a month and it seems to work for several weeks.  There is also a retail version available without a scrip called Certain-Dri.  But for deodorant, the Thai stone works great.  A word of caution: be VERY careful if you have a stone or otherwise hard floor in your bathroom.  I just dropped mine the other day and it shattered like glass.  I am still stepping on pieces of it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re allergic to the common antiperspirant deodorants, this is the way to go. Been using it for years, never developed sensitivity. Excellent odor protection, but keep in mind that it won&#x27;t reduce the sweating like antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> Ok, so like many others, I didn&#x27;t think that this product would work. But after using it for a month in the summer in Florida, I&#x27;m impressed. I would definately purchase again but think that will be a while because it seems to last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try if you suffer from wetness issues.</li>
    <li> good product and seller</li>
    <li> It keeps you from stinking. These things last for over a year.</li>
    <li> These deodorant stones are great!  The stuff really works and one stone lasts me a couple of years.  Very economical and effective, and no sticky residue under my arms like many stick deodorants leave.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works, no problems with body odor. Unfortunately, i had to stop using it. A rash developed on the skin of my armpits. It didn&#x27;t feel very good.</li>
    <li> works well for me without gumming up my underarms</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described and delivered promptly!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I switched to these deodorant sticks last year. I apply daily and they work great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my first stick on February 21, 2013, it was half this size (2.125 oz). Nineteen months later I am finally getting to the end of that stick. In other words, these things last a VERY long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I practice two forms of martial arts and am generally a pretty active person. This stick does not prevent sweating (as far as I can tell), nor does it make you smell flowery or like anything in particular. It does not completely eliminate bad odors, but from my experience it is more effective than other conventional deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to a product which prevents sweating and attempts to mask odors, this is not for you</li>
    <li> So the concept of creating an environment that discourages smelly bacteria growth under your pits WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not cover up odor, so its NOT a deodorant, and it also does not contain aluminum to block pores, so its NOT a anti-antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff because this product is made up of a salty solution that actually kills odor causing bacteria, by creating a harsh environment that bacteria will not thrive in. It has no odor, and you can even put on deodorant on top of this stuff for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works:&lt;br /&gt;Salt dehydrates bacteria through diffusion. The salty solution (among the other safe ingredients in this) create a hyper-tonic environment; water rushes out of the bacteria by osmosis, killing the bacteria as water goes from low salt to a high salt concentration, it dehydrates the bacteria cells into the salt, therefore killing the bacteria...and the odor it causes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this stuff for years, stink free. Make sure to apply liberally and all around your armpit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER  i defiantly PREFER the Spray version of Thai as it wont break if i drop it.</li>
    <li> Thai Deodorant is very effective to me, better than other brands. I do not smell whenever I wear this deodorant. My husband would smell my arm just to see if it really works Lol.</li>
    <li> It last several years unless you drop it in the sink and you are left with chards of hard salt stone that are difficult to use.  Hold on tight!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best personal hygiene products I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not only that my stick lasts me about 6 months, a savings in itself, I&#x27;ve saved hundreds more in preserving my dress shirts.  My old deodorants used to stain my dress shirts, and pretty badly so that they could only be worn 3 or 4 times in the summer before being thrown away.  After using this product, no orange stain!  Ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit more time to apply, and the stick has to be wet.  I apply mine right after taking a shower so not a problem for me.  You do have to apply it pretty liberally, and cover not just the under arm, but the area around it as well.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  I wanted to find a Deodorant to wear on my off days from work and this Thai stick does not stop the smell of BO.  I am just wearing it around the house so I am not doing anything physical that would cause me to sweat alot and smell (I am physically fit person so I do not just stink like BO all the time but this product makes you smell really strong like BO).  Stupid product not worth the money.  I was hoping to find something natural that works with no aluminum.</li>
    <li> NOTE: Salt deodorants work by killing the bacteria that cause odors under your arm. It is not an antiperspirant, it&#x27;s more a natural antibacterial.  You will absolutely not like this item if you are looking for something to stop you from sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Last a long time, no odor, natural, no chemicals or additives, works great on under arm smell, lasts a couple days after applied,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not an antiperspirant, some people find it ineffective, easily broken if dropped&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for the first time after trying many, many different types of deodorants and antiperspirant. Between living in Florida and L.A. heat was a given, and sweat happens. I would notice that when I used most deodorants I would not sweat, and there wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;sweat smell&amp;#34; under my arms, but there was a weird unpleasant smell that would happen sometimes. A sort of &amp;#34;dirty deodorant smell&amp;#34; that would appear towards the end of the day and the &amp;#34;deodorant balls&amp;#34; that formed under my arms (yuck) with some deodorants.  I tried all sorts of brands, different scents, unscented, roll-on, stick, gel based. Most were fine, no sweat, no gross under arm sweat smell, but by the end of the day it was all the same, almost like the stuff had broken down and got funky. I have a sensitive nose, and even if no one else smelled anything, I did and it was gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I was reading about using salt to kill bacteria that caused odors, and someone mentioned salt for deodorant. I was up for anything so I purchased some. I used it the day I got it, I was sure it would fail, and was actually amazed that it worked. While I did sweat in the heat, there was absolutely no odor, no sweat stains, no clumpy white stuff under my arms. The lack of smell was actually unbelievable. It took me a while to get used to feeling wet under my arms sometimes and not thinking &amp;#34;Oh no! I am gonna smell!&amp;#34; but after a while I just trusted I would not smell even while sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, who is very manly and can kick some deodorant butt when working in the yard, tried it after a few months of seeing me use it. Let me tell you now that I really did not think it would work on him and was shocked when it did. When he uses it he can sweat like a pig, but there is no odor. Actually works better for him when he knows he is going to be sweating because most antiperspirant aren&#x27;t going to stop you from sweating at the gym (or working in the yard) and fail you so why bother. The salt didn&#x27;t fail and he was odor free... sweaty, but odor free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, I found this out a few times while camping, that if I couldn&#x27;t put more salt on the next day, as long as you haven&#x27;t washed it off or showered, it works just the same! I also learned on that same camping trip that if you did start smelling you could rub more salt stick under your arms and it killed the smell within moments (It was a LONG camping trip -lol-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For smelly feet folks it will work on your feet, too. Jump out of the shower, rub it on your feet and between toes if you can, and let it dry a bit before putting on shoes. Wives, get your hubby to do this and you will thank me later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first use it it feels like you are putting nothing on and it can be weird. There is no white or gel goop to show you everything is covered. Just make sure to wet the stick and rub it EVERYWHERE under your arms. I actually go up my arm a bit and down my side a bit, not just the center underarm. There is no such thing as using too much, so go to town. After a little while you will get the hang of it and it will be nothing.  Putting it on after a shower makes it simple, I don&#x27;t even dry under my arms, I just rub the salt bar while wet and make it easy.  I also took mine out of the bottom part and rub it longways under my arms, it covers much more area per swipe and makes it much faster to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that if you drop this it can shatter and be useless. I dropped mine and had to purchase another after it broke into a million sharp pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I personally LOVE it. I use it everyday, and have never been let down, but I am ok with being wet under my arms on very hot occasions as long as I know I will not smell. For some people this will be a deal-breaker. It will not stop you from sweating, it will just stop you from smelling. If you are ok with that, you will absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> While I do understand that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, I will still recommend trying this product out. All natrual and non toxic to the body.....you can&#x27;t beat that. More impressive is the fact that is actually does work. I was EXTREMELY hesitant to purchase and then thought what do I have to loose but approx. 8 dollars. Big deal!&lt;br /&gt;I work at an industrial power plant. We make steam in order to make electricity. You can get a good idea of how hot my work environment is. I have put it through my tests of sweat and dirt. This works beyond expectaions and I am 1,000 percent sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews and take the tips. I wet it, rub it on and let it dry a few seconds. Make sure you rub a large area.....larger then just your hair section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This product works great!! I had been using Tom&#x27;s Natural deodorant for years and it suddenly stopped working. The lady at the health food store recommended this and I really like it! I can wear the same shirt twice and there&#x27;s still no odor in the armpit or the shirt. To apply, I put the ball under water for a couple of seconds, rub the ball under my arm, rinse the ball again, do the other arm, rinse again, put the cap on and set it in the medicine cabinet on a paper towel. No need to rub half way down the arm or scrub the armpit, etc. And seemingly this one container will last a long, long time.</li>
    <li> This is an all natural product with no scary ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given this as a gift to many people who are amazed at the efficiency of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even gave it to all the people in my office one Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very inexpensive as it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> The product itself is great and I&#x27;m only knocking off a star for the brittle plastic shell that is easily damaged in transit (one of my two was fairly smashed) or if dropped in the bathroom. Luckily the deodorant itself was just a little cracked, but not breaking apart and still fine for the purpose. My shipping issue may not be normal, and I still think it&#x27;s well worth the risk if you are allergic to aluminum hydroxide like I am. I am a moderate sweater, and don&#x27;t tend to be too stinky, so I may be an easy case. It does work very well for me, but I recommend that you be sure to go over the entire underarm and surrounding area with a couple passes to really deposit enough salt to keep the bacterial growth down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this product several weeks worth of try-out.&lt;br /&gt;It works great... IF you stay indoors, the temps are low and so is your energy level.&lt;br /&gt;If you work outdoors, or do any manual labor, or the temps are warm &amp; humid.....you&#x27;re going to smell like a lumberjack&#x27;s @ss crack in a couple hours and no amount of re-applying is going to make your friends &amp; co-workers nose hairs stop curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this is an awesome product for MOST people, but it&#x27;s about useless for those of us who work construction, demolition, farming, ranching, landscaping, exterior painting, forestry, welding, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Save it for the indoor, low activity, air conditioned times and you&#x27;ll be alright :)</li>
    <li> Love it! Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I am a believer in the deodorant stone. I used to use those deodorants that smell really good. Those were great. I liked using Dove for Men. I digress. I never noticed/cared that my armpits were dark. My sister got me this and told me that my body can absorb things through my skin and to be careful with products with lots of chemicals. I tried the product and have been using the same stone for over 3 years. I still have about 1/8 of a stone(4.25) left and I bought another to make sure I have some when I&#x27;m done, 6 months from now. Just make sure to apply the stone everywhere. A few times, I didn&#x27;t get far back enough and I smelled like sweat. That&#x27;s my own damn fault though. The product works great and I&#x27;m a repeat buyer. If you&#x27;re into antiperspirants and smelling good from your deodorant, this might not be for you but it&#x27;s a good move. Beware, your pits will sweat a lot, but you won&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 5 years since I&#x27;ve used regular deodorant. My main concerns about deodorants are parabens, aluminum, and strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced deodorant with a crystal deodorant which works for me. It&#x27;s easy to use and goes on clear. Simply wet the crystal under running water for just a tad and roll it under armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on clear.&lt;br /&gt;Really does control odor.&lt;br /&gt;Does not contain parabens or aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;Does not stain clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tendency to perspire heavily, this product won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tendency towards developing strong body odors this product may not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you drop the crystal it will separate from the base and you will struggle to use it.&lt;br /&gt;This particular size stick doesn&#x27;t travel well. I need to find a smaller one for my travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I use this product again? Yes this will continue to be my product of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who should use this product? This product works for people who do not perspire heavily and who are seeking alternatives to deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have used this deo stick for years and it works.  I use no other and feel confident all day long living in the tropics.  It is natural and one less toxin to worry about.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;No scent&lt;br /&gt;Does work&lt;br /&gt;Stick lasts for ever&lt;br /&gt;Does not stain clothes at all (no yellow armpits!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Stops most of the smell but I do still perspire which I can live with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only use this product now</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, Lasts for months, easy to use, no chemicals. This is odor control via killing of bacteria.  No perfumes or other harmful agents.</li>
    <li> I was having problems with odor because of hormonal changes, but now the problem is gone. After starting to use this product, I no longer stink no matter what I am doing or how sweaty I get. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  If you have had a mastectomy with lymph node dissection; you can&#x27;t use traditional deodorant.  This is all natural and the only thing we can use.  This doesn&#x27;t keep me from sweating but it keeps any odor away!  It also has no scent, so you can use any perfume you want and it won&#x27;t compete for smells.</li>
    <li> This is the best deordant I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;ve  developed allergies and/or sensitivities to several ingredients in soaps, lotions, deordants, perfumes, etc., imagine my horror when I couldn&#x27;t use my go-to deordant!! (I gave up the antiperspirant/deordant combo years ago)  I&#x27;d  heard of the Deordant Stone before so I gave it a try...I was blown away!!  This stuff really works!  It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain. There are times that I haven&#x27;t noticed any perspiration order either but I occasionally use an Organic Body Spray on my blouse (not directly on my Underarm) when needed.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is easy to use and hold on to while applying. I do store it in a dry cabinet with the cover on.</li>
    <li> Quality product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love the product, however they went from a hard plastic base to a soft plastic which, before the stick stayed FIRMLY in place. Through the whole use of the stick never once did I feel like it was going to come loose. But, with this new cheaper base, right when I opened it, the stick was loose and moved around. I kind of screwed it in tighter, and so far so good, but, I don&#x27;t trust it to hold the stick. So, now every time I use it, I fear it&#x27;s going to come out of the base and fall (and shatter) on to the floor. Which is why 4 instead of 5 stars. I don&#x27;t like the new base, it makes for a less pleasant experience because every time you use it, you have to make sure the damn thing isn&#x27;t going to come apart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, I like the product! It works well for me.</li>
    <li> So far, I love this stuff. No white residue, no BO, no blend of fragrance with BO :) I plan to take it on a trip to 11 countries, so we&#x27;ll see how it fairs in remote and hot locations!</li>
    <li> The cap on all three where cracked. Not sure if this is the real stuff you get from a health food store. Didn&#x27;t seem to keep the odor down. I have been wearing this brand for 10 years and never had a problem. Not happy with this order.</li>
    <li> Unscented... yeah... lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant. Buyers need to know the difference between a deodorant and an antiperspirant. This will NOT prevent sweaty underarms! But you won&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  May work for others.</li>
    <li> Not sure about extra hot days, but it works really well on regular days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it dries out my underarms immensely. That&#x27;s why I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they stay in business.  Great product, and each one lasts me over a year!  I like that I&#x27;m not putting bad chemicals on my body.  And, it works great!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is all natural and I am not putting chemicals on my body. It seems like it will last forever as it is hard like a stone. I was surprised at how well it works. I was skeptical at first and almost didn&#x27;t buy it. But I&#x27;m glad I did. Price is right. Delivery was great. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works like advertised. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Lasts a very long time- like a couple years. Great dispenser. No skin irritation. No sickening fragrance. No nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used every product on the market and the crystal stick is the only thing I have found to help my perspiration!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using the other type of deodorants years ago once I found out this consistently works.  It feels like you have nothing on (I don&#x27;t get those occasional rashes or painful lumps anymore). I definitely do not smell at the end of the day.  Even after hitting the gym after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still gets five stars although it has a tendency to shatter if dropped. You end up trying to salvage the smaller pieces which works too.  You just have to be careful and make sure you put enough water on the stone or, what I do, wet my hands and pat my (clean) armpits.  You don&#x27;t have to drench yourself so the wetness dries really quickly so it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but decided for the money it was worth the risk. I am glad I bought it, it does exactly what it said it would. Now, If you are a sweater I would consider the fact it does nothing for wetness.  The other thing to be aware of is its like glass, If you drop it, it&#x27;s gone. It will shatter like glass. This is my second attempt. The first one I had did not have a holder, It was just a block of product. I had it for at least 5 months before dropping it. Wet the stone, use it and forget it. One thing worth mentioning is initially I didn&#x27;t think it worked very well. I then expanded my &amp;#34;pit&amp;#34; zone getting the entire armpit and I have no issues at all. I like it for one because its natural. 2 because after using deodorant for years now I have some kind of issue causing me to itch horribly with regular deodorant. Not anymore. Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> the best deodorant I have ever used last me at least 12 hours others about 4 its my deodorant for the rest of my life everyone please try you will give 5 star just as I. Vicky in SC</li>
    <li> Great product and great service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure. Maybe I&#x27;m being overly judgmental, but I just don&#x27;t like it. I wanted a more natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t have all the chemicals but I think this swayed too far in the natural direction! it kind of smells after using it for a while (even after washing it off) and doesn&#x27;t seem to remove the odor from your armpit and it&#x27;s kind of annoying to apply since it seems you got to apply it a lot to get any effect. I feel bad even giving it a negative review because I am super pro-natural ingredients and maybe I am just use to regular deodorants I&#x27;m not appreciating what real deodorant should be doing. I think I&#x27;ll go to Tom&#x27;s of Maine or something like that.</li>
    <li> I recently began using this as an alternative to antiperspirants with aluminum. It holds and prevents ordor much better than other aluminum-free deodorants I have tried. I recommend this product if you are trying to cut out your exposure to aluminum-containing products.</li>
    <li> After reading all the scares of aluminum, ammonia, glycol, and all the other garbage put in conventional deodorants, I had to make a change.  After trying SIX organic natural deodorants (Herban Cowboy being the better of the pack), this one outperformed beyond my expectations.  It lasts a day on me.  Even after going to the gym, it works fantastic!  My biggest problem was not necessarily perspiration, it was the odor.  This one completely eliminates and blocks out any hint of odor.  I am beyond pleased with such a great product.  I originally bought mine from Whole Foods and it is similarily-priced here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough, the product says it is great for foot odor.  If you have that problem, might be worth picking up a second one just for that.  Another tidbit is I make sure to give the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; a quick 1-2 second rinse under running water and then apply under one arm, rinse again, and then apply to the other.  I&#x27;ve only applied it after taking a shower and never tried in-between showering as I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it wearing off.  The stick itself has a faint salty smell to it, but it is so minor and non-offensive that you don&#x27;t notice it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five star product and excellently-priced.</li>
    <li> Just started using it  -- not use to feeling \\&quot;wet\\&quot; under my arms, but the product is not an antipersperant, its only a deodorant (I don&#x27;t stink) so its doing what it is supposed to do. Just don&#x27;t think I like the wet feeling..</li>
    <li> I Purchased the Thai Deodorant Stick for my daughter and it truly did not hold her,her underarms were very smelly and wet</li>
    <li> So called \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; deodorant crystals make their claim to being \\&quot;all-natural,\\&quot; yet possess ammonium alum as a principal ingredient. Ammonium alum, or ammonium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate, is a sulfate of aluminum, and therefore is an aluminum salt, just like aluminum chlorohydrate, the principal ingredient in antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant crystal is actually one giant greenwashing scam designed to take advantage of \\&quot;green\\&quot; minds with clever marketing tactics. Just like with aluminum chlorohydrate, studies have suggested a link between ammonium alum and several types of cancer, osteoporosis, anemia, headaches, kidney problems, liver problems, gastrointestinal problems, extreme nervousness, bone softening, decreased calcium absorption, muscle aches, and even colic and rickets in babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of potential toxicity, aluminum chlorohydrate and ammonium alum are one in the same; as is potassium alum, or any other aluminum salt. Through clever greenwashing propaganda, these crystal manufacturers have marketed their product as being \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; or comprised of 100% natural mineral salts and nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arsenic, lead, and mercury are also \\&quot;all-natural,\\&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t exactly mean that they should be applied liberally to your underarms. All aluminum salts are \\&quot;natural mineral salts\\&quot; as they exist naturally in chemistry. Again, that does not necessarily mean that they are healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another piece of propaganda used by these crystal manufacturers is their insistence on claiming that their product is a natural \\&quot;African\\&quot; or natural \\&quot;Thai\\&quot; crystal. This can also be filed nicely into the realm of fantasy, as these crystals were all manufactured, and even if they weren&#x27;t machined the way they were, they&#x27;d still be potentially toxic, none the less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When forced to concede that ammonium alum is indeed a potential toxin that these crystals possess, deodorant crystal manufacturers will rush to claim that although their product does in fact contain potentially toxic aluminum salts, these salts have a chemistry such that the ions in the \\&quot;natural mineral salts\\&quot; are too large to pass through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or they will claim that the ions are negatively charged, and therefore cannot enter the body. Both of these claims are patently false and have about as much empirical evidence to substantiate them as the tooth fairy. Skin pores, especially in the underarm regions, are millions of times larger than the ions in question, meaning aluminum will get in your body like sand falling through a cargo net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now that you know the truth about deodorant crystals, don&#x27;t let these manufacturers off the hook for their outright, greenwashed lies. Let them know that we won&#x27;t stand for dishonesty when it comes to what goes under our arms.</li>
    <li> I like it for a deodorant. I made the mistake of dropping it and it shattered into alot of small pieces. It would have lasted a long time if hadn&#x27;t of dropped it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 47-year-old male and have been using these for years because they just work! I can work outside in the hot sun and they really do keep me odor-free. I usually apply it right after showering in the morning when my underarms are still wet. I LOVE that I don&#x27;t have to use aluminum or chemical based products any more!</li>
    <li> This product works great for my husband and I both.  We each appreciate that we&#x27;re not having to smear chemicals all over our under arms and worry about what is soaking into our bodies.  It is effective at combating body odor.  I purchased this for myself, and he ended up trying it once so he kept that one, and I bought myself the same thing in a spray.  I prefer the spray, he prefers the rock.  Both are great!</li>
    <li> I like this product. Under my normal day to day use I have been able to shower every other day with no odor. There are a few fabrics I wear that I need to use Young Livings deodorant; when wear them, as it works better.(but pricey)&lt;br /&gt;I love knowing this product will outlast anything; money saved. I eat very well; small amounts of sugar, no grains, and as natural as I can; so my body has minimal toxins to get rid of; I am sure this helps prevent odors also.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any irritation, no allergy issues with this product.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of trying crystals as a deodorant. But after hearing and researching about the terrible side effects of aluminum on the body that is in the majority of main stream deodorants, I decided to look for alternative products. My main concern was that I also wanted something that would totally combat order because i am not one of those lucky people who can go without deodorant....Let me tell you, this little stick works! It&#x27;s like magic or something, but you just wet it and rub it on your under arm, and VOILA! My only negative comment is that it can get a little messy with the water running down your arm while applying. But that is minor given you are odor and aluminum free! I can go all day and not a whiff of anything. Best deodorant around, point blank period.</li>
    <li> been using deodorant crystals for years. Yes, they actually work and NO aluminum.</li>
