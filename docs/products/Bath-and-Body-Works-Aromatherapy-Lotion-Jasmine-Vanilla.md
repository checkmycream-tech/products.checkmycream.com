      <li>i love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this lotion &amp; you can&#x27;t buy it in the stores anymore because it&#x27;s been discontinued.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and is nice to my skin as well.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>Love being able to buy stuff online instead of going to the mall.</li>
      <li>, I USE IT EVERY TWO DAYS, AND IT REALLY SEMALL GOOD,</li>
      <li>With all my bath and body work products they have had free shipping.</li>
      <li>liked the price and was very surprised to see Bath &amp; Body Works products on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Now that I know I can get them reasonably priced on Amazon, that&#x27;s where I will get them most of the time.</li>
      <li>It is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>THOUGH I PREFER MILD BODY LOTION.....</li>
      <li>It is a mild but desirable scent just like the hand soap was.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast too!!</li>
      <li>I wore it to a party with no other scents and I had several people say that I smelled soooo good!  </li>

      <li>THe first ones made about 4 years ago, stayed on skin longer, but hey today atleast we have it.  </li>
      <li>My wife loves this stuff - and I don&#x27;t mind it much either!</li>
      <li>This item is exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice tangy sharp skin invigorating scent and feel that is a bit &amp;#34;Sensual&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the name suggestion was what made me think about it in the description, that really the whole point of the Bath &amp; Body Works Aromatherapy brands of lotion, but remember, it is lotion ONLY.</li>
      <li>But it is just a little stronger than I would have liked.</li>
      <li>I absolutely loathe malls, but go often when B&amp;BW has these products on sale.</li>
      <li>This rich, creamy lotion has a heavenly scent, and keeps one&#x27;s skin so soft, with the aroma lasting for hours.</li>
      <li>This is a new fragrance</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the Bath &amp; Body Jasmine Vanilla hand soap but it is too hard to find anymore.  </li>
      <li>I wore this years ago and found an old bottle and decided to try it again.</li>

    <li> Actually received Black Currant Vanilla, instead of Jasmine Vanilla</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT, I USE IT EVERY TWO DAYS, AND IT REALLY SEMALL GOOD, THOUGH I PREFER MILD BODY LOTION.....</li>
    <li> When the Bath and Body decided to stop making this crea, I wanted to cry.  I saw it on amazon and just had to have it.  I smells divine and feel sso silky and stays on for a long time.  THe first ones made about 4 years ago, stayed on skin longer, but hey today atleast we have it.  Its still great.  Great buy. wish it was prime and shipping cheaper.</li>
    <li> The smell is very nice and others commented on it. But it is just a little stronger than I would have liked. The service was great. It arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This rich, creamy lotion has a heavenly scent, and keeps one&#x27;s skin so soft, with the aroma lasting for hours.</li>
    <li> Wonderful sent.  Bath &amp; Body works no longer carries this sent in the stores and it is my favorite.  It was very popular and I do not understand why they stopped carring it.</li>
    <li> The smell is so wonderful every time I were this people always ask were I get It from its a must get item. With all my bath and body work products they have had free shipping.</li>
    <li> This is my favourite scent, which alas has been discontinued. I am beyond thrilled I could get it from Amazon. I used it yesterday for my wedding and was so happy - I don&#x27;t wear perfume, and prefer scented lotions, and this one is just perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This is a nice tangy sharp skin invigorating scent and feel that is a bit &amp;#34;Sensual&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m sure the name suggestion was what made me think about it in the description, that really the whole point of the Bath &amp; Body Works Aromatherapy brands of lotion, but remember, it is lotion ONLY. But calling it &amp;#34;Aromatherapy&amp;#34;, and if you buy in to the psychological effects of the lotion, have at it mates, it really is great!</li>
    <li> Nice body cream but the smell is not what I had in mind - not enough vanilla for me!</li>
    <li> I wore this years ago and found an old bottle and decided to try it again. I forgot how much I love this scent!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother in law for Mother&#x27;s Day. This is a new fragrance and I&#x27;ve never been a Jasmine fan. I like this same product in the Eucalyptus scents. When my mother-in-law opened it, it smelled so good, I almost wanted to keep it for myself. She loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the price and was very surprised to see Bath &amp; Body Works products on Amazon. I absolutely loathe malls, but go often when B&amp;BW has these products on sale. The last sale was $5 for these products. Now that I know I can get them reasonably priced on Amazon, that&#x27;s where I will get them most of the time. (Except when they are $5 a bottle.)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It wasn&#x27;t any cheaper buying it online, than buying it directly from the Bath and Body Works store, but it was more convenient. Saved me a 100 mile round trip drive.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents.  Love being able to buy stuff online instead of going to the mall.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly what I ordered.  Delivery was perfect.  If anyone is looking for a great lotion I recommend you order this one.  I get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Gift for my sister. She loves it. She is using it everyday and she loves the smell too. Thank you</li>
    <li> I like the scent after it has been on for a bit and toned down. It is pretty strong. The lotion does moisturize well, but I only use it on my hands as I don&#x27;t think I could handle it all over.</li>
    <li> best shower gel and lotion, my wife favorite</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the Bath &amp; Body Jasmine Vanilla hand soap but it is too hard to find anymore.  I saw this and took a chance with it.  LOVE IT!  I wore it to a party with no other scents and I had several people say that I smelled soooo good!  I really am impressed.  It is a mild but desirable scent just like the hand soap was.  It goes on smooth and is nice to my skin as well.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff - and I don&#x27;t mind it much either! I get it for her because she loves the way it makes her skin feel and smell and I&#x27;ve found myself using it quite a bit too!</li>
    <li> i love this product.  Shipped quickly and in good shape.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> This is a long lasting scented fragrance. Great after a shower moisturizer and enhanced smell. I love this and reccomend</li>
    <li> I thing this is a very good brand of body lotion. I decided to try this scent. The only thing is that is glass and very heavy to carry.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  Even better, my husband loves it more.  I use it every day after I shower, and you can still smell it the next morning.  I hope they never discontinue it !</li>
    <li> Love this lotion &amp; you can&#x27;t buy it in the stores anymore because it&#x27;s been discontinued.  The lotion is in a glass bottle and it came wrapped in bubble wrap.  Delivery was fast too!!</li>
    <li> Bath and body used to carry this and it was discontinued.  I love the heavenly smell.  The hand wash foam soap is even better, but that also was discontinued</li>
    <li> This lotion is so decadent.  The scent lingers for a very long time and I always get compliments when wearing it.  I prefer to use this over any perfume.  And as an added bonus it&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizer!  Wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
