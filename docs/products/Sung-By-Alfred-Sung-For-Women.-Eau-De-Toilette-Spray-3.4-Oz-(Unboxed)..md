    <li> This is my go to fragrance and has been for 20 years. It lasts all day with just one spray! Wonderful, classic fragrance. Every time I wear it I get compliments from men and women.

    <li> This discontinued item can no longer be found in any retail stores.  Amazon is the only place I can purchase it.  Amazon - Please Stock Up for me.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product because of the great price and size.  When I received the item, it took forever to get here.  Plus when I wear it, the smell does not last as long as my previous bottle. I will finish this product but from now on I will pay alittle more to get it locally.</li>
    <li> Started wearing Sung by Alfred Sung about 10 years ago and never tire of it.  In fact, at least once a month someone will compliment me on my scent and ask what is the name of the fragrance.  And purchasing on Amazon saves me A LOT of money (the 3.4 oz bottle retails for over $60)...it is the tester bottle, but since it&#x27;s just for me and not a gift, I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  Would recommend Sung highly!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents. It&#x27;s very potent, so a little will do and will last all day. This is a classy scent that screams power!</li>
    <li> I wore this scent for years &amp; it suddenly vanished from stores; not even available in discount malls.

Now that I&#x27;ve re-found it, I&#x27;m getting the same compliments I got 15 years ago when I was a faithful wearer of this delicious cologne!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful Clean fresh light fragrance I especially enjoy for warm weather. One of my favorites. Would love a sample set of all Sung Scents.</li>

    <li> I received Sung By Alfred Sung For Women. Eau De Toilett Spray 3.4 Oz (Unboxed).&lt;br /&gt;I was very satisfied with the service and product and would highly recommend this to&lt;br /&gt;my friends.</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to have found this on Amazon, have worn this for years, it is an unforgettable signature fragrance - I get compliments all the time when I wear this perfume -  Thanks Amazon !</li>
    <li> The only perfume my wife wears.&lt;br /&gt;No package is fine.&lt;br /&gt; My wife wishes the full strength perfume is available&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mamoru Ogata</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE FRAGRANCE I SPENT AT LEAST AN HOUR SMELLING DIFFERENT SCENTS BEFORE PICKING THIS ONE, I HAVE USED IT FOR 10 YEARS AND ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS.  BE CAREFULL TO BUY ONLY ORIGINAL IN A BOX SCENTS AS THERE MUST BE CHEAPER COPIES ON THE MARKET THAT HAVE BEEN DILUTED.</li>
    <li> I  LOVE this aroma.  It&#x27;s feminine but not sickening.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sophisticated  but suitable enough for every day.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use much.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;knock people&lt;br /&gt;down&amp;#34;  when you pass by.  It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.  Always happy with my orders from Amazon.  I highly recommend this perfume for anyone that cannot find it in a retail store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on this perfume.  I wear it almost every day and even keep some in my car just in case.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about finding my favorite perfume that I have been wearing for over 20 years at such a great price, I even order 3 bottles at once. By once it got here, I found it almost watered down, very lite in color and the smell is very faint.... in all 3 bottles. I am not sure if these were testers or not but they did not come in a box like the picture showed. I will be finding this locally from now on.</li>
    <li> If my wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy.  The product was as advertized and delivered as agreed.  I would order it again if she wanted more.</li>
    <li> I have had several bottles of this wonderful perfume and keep coming back for more. Every time I wear it, I am questioned as to what is the wonderful perfume I am wearing. Considering how reasonable the price is, it last a long time. Always a winner in the compliments department.</li>
    <li> This perfume is my signature scent and was received as described. The size and box are a good value. The package was wrapped well and received promptly. I&#x27;m very pleased and will order again.</li>
    <li> The Sung perfume is probably great for others, but it is a perfume that doesn&#x27;t last for me. That may not be true for others, but I&#x27;m not that crazy about it. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
