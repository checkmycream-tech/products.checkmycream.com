      <li>Great for deep browning, great product.</li>
      <li>It works great and fast!</li>
      <li>Turns out I like Maui Babe much better.</li>
      <li>My face burned a bit, but it was really more of a tan/burn.  </li>
      <li>Many reviews said they never burned, so I went with that (against my better judgement).  </li>
      <li>Smooth!</li>

      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Favorite lotion.  </li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I would wear this unless I knew that I was going to be able to shower after I was done in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t go to Hawaii, this is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>my favorite tanning oil</li>
      <li>I am outdoors most days and spend hours in the pool.</li>
      <li>Ok, I don&#x27;t know what to say about this stuff.</li>
      <li>I really recommend this, honestly amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sweet smelling, almost like Pez.</li>
      <li>The original formula purchased in Hawaii seems to have worked better</li>
      <li>It words very quickly -</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and tan.</li>
      <li>I put the formula on and sat outside in the Florida sun for an hour and achieved a very nice tan that lasted almost a month.</li>
      <li>The product does say you can apply sunscreen first, and then this on top of the sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on the fence about this, it&#x27;s the oil one...not sure if really browns any faster than bain de soleil orange gelee.</li>
      <li>I already tan easily, but this really kicks things up a notch.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it was in Hawaii, from then I was hooked!</li>
      <li>Once you have a base tan you will love the hydrating effect of this combination of delightful scents and oils combined to give you a beautiful and lasting tan.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product, but I will just be cautious in knowing my own burn/tanning abilities.  </li>
      <li>I am a freckled red-head who rarely tans.  </li>
      <li>and it honestly feels really gross</li>
      <li>I quickly ordered some and was eager to try it out for the first time.  </li>
      <li>It feels great on my dry skin and it works better than any other leading brand I have tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably rotate back  and forth, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>I was so much darker after just 20 minutes!</li>
      <li>I love it and still use it living back on the mainland.</li>
      <li>This stuff tanned me sooooo fast!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what the secret is, but I have gotten such great color that many people have remarked on it.  </li>
      <li>I used this for my first real sunning session of the summer season.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands brown, like a self bronzer, but it is very greasy.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to spend too much time in the sun</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>but i really doubted this product.</li>
      <li>Fast to receive..</li>
      <li>I can definitely see the tan color, and as the burn is going down, I seem to be becoming more tan.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be careful if you burn easily, this stuff has no protection.</li>
      <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
      <li>I saw a friend recently who was so golden brown</li>
      <li>This product did it&#x27;s job and helped me get a healthy glow, but I had a hard time handling the smell.</li>
      <li>This is way too oily and also it isn&#x27;t clear on Amazon whether or not it contains mineral oil--which it does.</li>
      <li>and I have a sensitive</li>
      <li>If it is early in the season, I will most likely use this in conjunction with a sunscreen until I have a bit more of a base tan to work from.</li>
      <li>moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thick oil, mine like many of the others was leaking when I received it.</li>
      <li>Still too early to tell if it will last,  </li>
      <li>you really need to towel down well after.  </li>
      <li>last time I bought this---it was very different---it is now watered down....</li>
      <li>it smells like exactly what&#x27;s in it,  and it&#x27;s a little strange</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff tanned me sooooo fast!</li>
    <li> Now this is a product you want to use to darken your tan.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years of living on Maui....I love it and still use it living back on the mainland. Beautiful island tan for sure.</li>
    <li> The original formula purchased in Hawaii seems to have worked better I think.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizing oil. Gave me a nice color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this, it&#x27;s the oil one...not sure if really browns any faster than bain de soleil orange gelee. I&#x27;ll probably rotate back  and forth, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> Great product...for a great tan!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!  I have also tried the Maui Babe, but that stuff smells like soy sauce and is disgusting!  This Maui Island smells just fine and works great.  I already tan easily, but this really kicks things up a notch.</li>
    <li> Favorite lotion.  Fast to receive..Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this on vacation and while I think it helped my tan go to the next level, the smell is not pleasant at all. I would not purchase again based solely on the scent.</li>
    <li> Deep tanning,no sunscreen,I use occasionally after have good base tan.Absorbs quickly,not greasy but is oil so is alittle oily but absorbs well,light floral fragrance.I also add this on top of my sunscreen sometimes,to bump up tanning intensity.Works great.</li>
    <li> I was trapped between this tanning oil and maui babe! Glad I got this one, smells amazing and tans really fast; contains no sunscreen so try to get a base tan before using it before using it OR use sunblock then apply. I really recommend this, honestly amazing!</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t know what to say about this stuff. It does help you tan better but the downside is that it has the consistency of motor oil!!!!! Not kidding. It also has a funky smell that I can&#x27;t quite describe. It definitely helps moisturize and as I said helps get you over the tan hump but I just can&#x27;t get over how thick it is. When you have it on, literally everything sticks to you and it honestly feels really gross but I use it so be you own judge. In the end is recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! last time I bought this---it was very different---it is now watered down....no joke....:(</li>
    <li> I was so much darker after just 20 minutes! It works great and fast! I would definitely recommend! The best part is that you can use sunscreen with it and it still works and you won&#x27;t burn. I am very happy with it. :-)</li>
    <li> This is clearly the best suntan oil I have EVER used!  Ya just keep getting darker and darker!!  It feels great on my dry skin and it works better than any other leading brand I have tried.</li>
    <li> Turns out I like Maui Babe much better. This is way too oily and also it isn&#x27;t clear on Amazon whether or not it contains mineral oil--which it does. So if you have an aversion to mineral oil like I do,  this won&#x27;t be for you.</li>
    <li> This one is very good stuff goes along way</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t go to Hawaii, this is the next best thing. I am outdoors most days and spend hours in the pool. I use the oil each morning as a moisturizer and reapply in the evening. My skin is smooth and tan. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This boosted my tan but not much more then other tanning lotions, it does however make my skin incredibly soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thick oil, mine like many of the others was leaking when I received it. It was in a plastic bag and just a little bit had come out but the cap was not tightened on it at all.&lt;br /&gt;The smell... it smells like exactly what&#x27;s in it,  and it&#x27;s a little strange but it didn&#x27;t stick to me at all.  Certainly not as nauseating as some of the reviews had me worried about and I have a sensitive nose.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for indoor tanning,  and i think it works just as well if not better then the $100 plus lotions they&#x27;re selling in there,  but the short time in the bed doesn&#x27;t allow it to absorb so you really need to towel down well after.  Again not a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it about five times already and I have no issues with it staining my clothing. That along with the price, it does give me a slight boost and that it makes my skin so soft I would no doubt purchase again.</li>
    <li> easiest tanning lotion ever will definitely buy it again and again</li>
    <li> Still too early to tell if it will last,  but i really doubted this product. I am pale, and only burn. I used this and sat in the sun only 20 mins and got color without burning. Very nice!</li>
    <li> One of the best products on the market.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Once you have a base tan you will love the hydrating effect of this combination of delightful scents and oils combined to give you a beautiful and lasting tan.  It last a long time and you don&#x27;t have to reapply like a lotion so often.</li>
    <li> I put the formula on and sat outside in the Florida sun for an hour and achieved a very nice tan that lasted almost a month. LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> The best product ever!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all. Thin, watery.</li>
    <li> Best tanning oil ever!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this in a while - I was holding onto a bottle of it for years and then it ran out! I&#x27;m reordering today! This product has no sunscreen, so use with caution. BUT if you want to take your base tan to the next level, this stuff makes a huge difference. It is very thick, almost like syrup so you don&#x27;t need to use much. My last bottle lasted years. I only used it on my lower body because I didn&#x27;t want to burn on my chest, etc. Anyway, I saw there were no reviews and wanted everyone to know that this product delivers!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading reviews online.  I saw a friend recently who was so golden brown and I asked her what she was doing.  She told me the secret was using the Hawaii Maui Island Secret Browning Formula.  I quickly ordered some and was eager to try it out for the first time.  Here&#x27;s my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  This is an oil, and it looks similar to maple syrup when it comes out of the bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands brown, like a self bronzer, but it is very greasy.  I washed my hands with soap after applying, and I had to wash them twice to try to get all the grease off.  You will look oiled up after you apply this.  I don&#x27;t think I would wear this unless I knew that I was going to be able to shower after I was done in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I used this for my first real sunning session of the summer season.  There were parts of me that haven&#x27;t seen the sun for a while!  I did burn with this, so please use caution.  Many reviews said they never burned, so I went with that (against my better judgement).  The product does say you can apply sunscreen first, and then this on top of the sunscreen.  If you tend to burn, I would recommend you start out with a sunscreen base.  With that being said, my stomach burned the worse and it is the area that sees the least amount of sun normally.  My face burned a bit, but it was really more of a tan/burn.  I can definitely see the tan color, and as the burn is going down, I seem to be becoming more tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product, but I will just be cautious in knowing my own burn/tanning abilities.  If it is early in the season, I will most likely use this in conjunction with a sunscreen until I have a bit more of a base tan to work from.</li>
    <li> This product did it&#x27;s job and helped me get a healthy glow, but I had a hard time handling the smell. It&#x27;s very sweet smelling, almost like Pez.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of medium skin tone, I can get a tan in the shade! Lol!!! But using this product leaves my color looking bronzed! Rather then ash looking! I love it! The first time I tried it was in Hawaii, from then I was hooked!</li>
    <li> used it when we went on the cruise and havent quit since. use it every other day to keep your tan and the vitaim e in it keeps your skin so soft</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Use to order from website for $23!!!! This makes a little sun go a long way! And the results are DARK brown.. Be careful if you burn easily, this stuff has no protection. Not recommended for first time in sun, get a base tan first!</li>
    <li> my favorite tanning oil</li>
    <li> Awesome and love the warm brown tan it gives!!</li>
    <li> I tried this because all of the reviews were very good. Iv used it 3 times and I haven&#x27;t burned....which I usually do. But I haven&#x27;t tanned either.</li>
    <li> The best that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I am a freckled red-head who rarely tans.  I don&#x27;t know what the secret is, but I have gotten such great color that many people have remarked on it.  I don&#x27;t have to spend too much time in the sun or I can sit out at the less damaging hours, I haven&#x27;t burned with it, even though usually I can get a burn in March in a half an hour.  What a great discovery.</li>
    <li> Great for deep browning, great product.</li>
    <li> Smooth! Love it! Unbelievable tan!</li>
    <li> The best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve every used.</li>
    <li> Best tanning and moisturizer oil in one, it&#x27;s good for your skin too.</li>
    <li> Worked like nothing I&#x27;ve used before! Also leaves skin nice and silky</li>
    <li> I love the Maui Island secret tanning but half the bottle leaked out in packaging and it is not cheap</li>
    <li> Nice product have been using this product for a couple years, every winter when I travel to someplace warm this oil comes with me</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff love it</li>
    <li> The Best!!!!!  I have the best tan I have ever had.  It words very quickly - I recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> Was oilier than expected</li>
    <li> Smells bad but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it helps the tanning process.</li>
