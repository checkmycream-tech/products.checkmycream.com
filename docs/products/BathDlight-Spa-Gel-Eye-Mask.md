### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>(if you get headaches) it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>I wish I read the reviews before I bought these, but my mistake was in figuring one was as good as another!</li>
      <li>WARM.&lt;br /&gt;IT FELT NICE</li>
      <li>AND IT WAS VERY COMFORTABLE ON MY EYES.</li>
      <li>Very cheap quality, wont not have got this even for a 1$.</li>
      <li>I got this in the mail and would return it if it wasn&#x27;t more hassle</li>
      <li>I am literally not even sure this thing is sterile inside.</li>
      <li>I have used many eye packs, this is the thinnest one I have even seen.</li>
      <li>The string that you wrap around your head also seems to come out easily.</li>
      <li>It looks like they&#x27;ve filled it with swamp goo.    </li>
      <li>It came in a cheap plastic bag, \\&quot;made in China\\&quot;, and it shows.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
      <li>BUT THE ELASTIC BAND IT CAME WITH WOULDN&#x27;T FIT OVER A CHILD&#x27;S HEAD.</li>
      <li>I CHANGE THE BAND TO FIT, AND I USED IT</li>
      <li>I looked at the \\&quot;goo\\&quot; inside the mask and it is full of cloudy trails, and \\&quot;chunks\\&quot; of indeterminate origin.</li>
      <li>Other than the strap around the head, it works great.  </li>
      <li>Rarely used this but noticed how the gel inside the mask just dissipated one day.  </li>
      <li>then it was worth.</li>
      <li>If you dont have a large head, and just want it to cool your eyes</li>
      <li>Just because people get free shipping on your website does not mean we have no expectations of quality.</li>
      <li>bought this for my husband but his head is toolarge for the strap, but he likes to put it in the fridge for a few minutes and then place it right above his eyes or over his ees without using the strap and relaxe, he says its great for headaches and irnoically toothaches!</li>
      <li>On the first use, the metal barb broke off so we had to tie a knot in it.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found that my head is too big for most things, but it is for this.  </li>
      <li>The picture is very deceiving, but I still use it almost every morning</li>
      <li>Additionally the band is very tight - I had to make my own adjustments.</li>
      <li>I would suggest going to your local Target or Walmart or Sephora and spending an extra $5-$10 for one that isn&#x27;t filled with floaties!    </li>
      <li>There was another gel eye mask of a similar price and the only reason why I opted for these instead was because it was an add on item, so shipping was free with my order.</li>
      <li>I am seriously reconsidering ever buying any kind of spa product on amazon again.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
      <li>This product has a cheap elastic held on with little metal barbs.  </li>
      <li>These things arrived in cheap packaging, and the gel was completely dried out.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, THEIR TIME TO PACK IT, OR DELIVER IT.</li>
      <li>Smaller size, which I like, as my face is smaller, but I wish there was a little more gel.  </li>
      <li>in the picture appeared on Amazon, the green liquid is full, but the one I have received has quarter amount, its kinnda deceiving,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge face or anything, they&#x27;re just a little smaller than I think they should be.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a larger ask - it really only covers your eyes well, not so much the area around it.</li>
      <li>BARELY has any gel.</li>
      <li>The elastic makes it pretty tight against the head, especially if you have a big head like me.  </li>

<li> This mask has little to no gel at all, I went to the local CVS and got a good one instead.. disappointed.</li>
<li> This was almost completely empty of the green fluid shown.</li>
<li> I should&#x27;ve bought the one from Walgreens for almost the same price,its very small,cheap and there was barely liquid inside mine.its not worth it :(</li>
<li> The gel inside was not leaking, but still did not even fill up half of the mask.</li>
<li> This mask is very poorly made it came with very little of the green filler in the mask this mask is made for a 7 year old head.</li>
<li> There was not enough gel to fill both sides of the mask, therefore I cannot give a high rating of this awful product.</li>
<li> I would seriously reconsider buying this if you are reading this review.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s something that can be worked around, but a little inconvenient.    </li>
<li> It stays cold for quite a while.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid to even put this junk against my skin.</li>
<li> but this  had a horrible quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> We&#x27;ve gotten a product like this before that was a sinus mask instead of just the eye mask.  The sinus mask had the plastic wrap all the way around the head with a clip to tighten it.  This product has a cheap elastic held on with little metal barbs.  On the first use, the metal barb broke off so we had to tie a knot in it.  The elastic makes it pretty tight against the head, especially if you have a big head like me.  It&#x27;s something that can be worked around, but a little inconvenient.    Other than the strap around the head, it works great.  It stays cold for quite a while.</li>
    <li> It came in a cheap plastic bag, \\&quot;made in China\\&quot;, and it shows. I&#x27;m afraid to even put this junk against my skin. I looked at the \\&quot;goo\\&quot; inside the mask and it is full of cloudy trails, and \\&quot;chunks\\&quot; of indeterminate origin. I am literally not even sure this thing is sterile inside.

I would suggest going to your local Target or Walmart or Sephora and spending an extra $5-$10 for one that isn&#x27;t filled with floaties!    Hey Amazon! Just because people get free shipping on your website does not mean we have no expectations of quality. I am seriously reconsidering ever buying any kind of spa product on amazon again.</li>
    <li> in the picture appeared on Amazon, the green liquid is full, but the one I have received has quarter amount, its kinnda deceiving,</li>
    <li> THE GEL EYE MASK IN OF IT SELF WORKS WELL. BUT THE ELASTIC BAND IT CAME WITH WOULDN&#x27;T FIT OVER A CHILD&#x27;S HEAD. I CHANGE THE BAND TO FIT, AND I USED IT WARM.&lt;br /&gt;IT FELT NICE AND IT WAS VERY COMFORTABLE ON MY EYES. I WILL USE IT OFTEN.</li>
    <li> I have gotten one of these mask before and like it. The one that I got in this delivery BARELY has any gel.</li>
    <li> Smaller size, which I like, as my face is smaller, but I wish there was a little more gel.  I find myself having to spread it around to actually cover my eyes fully.  The picture is very deceiving, but I still use it almost every morning</li>
    <li> There was not enough gel to fill both sides of the mask, therefore I cannot give a high rating of this awful product.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband but his head is toolarge for the strap, but he likes to put it in the fridge for a few minutes and then place it right above his eyes or over his ees without using the strap and relaxe, he says its great for headaches and irnoically toothaches!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found that my head is too big for most things, but it is for this.  it doesn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy this! I should&#x27;ve bought the one from Walgreens for almost the same price,its very small,cheap and there was barely liquid inside mine.its not worth it :(</li>
    <li> Edges scratch the skin around my eyes. I don&#x27;t have a huge face or anything, they&#x27;re just a little smaller than I think they should be.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a larger ask - it really only covers your eyes well, not so much the area around it. Additionally the band is very tight - I had to make my own adjustments. I actually thought maybe it was a kids mask, although I&#x27;ve never seen one like that before. If you dont have a large head, and just want it to cool your eyes (if you get headaches) it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This was almost completely empty of the green fluid shown. Low quality and complete waste of my time. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail and would return it if it wasn&#x27;t more hassle then it was worth. The gel inside was not leaking, but still did not even fill up half of the mask. I will never buy from this manufacturer again. Ever.</li>
    <li> Rarely used this but noticed how the gel inside the mask just dissipated one day.  Eh...</li>
    <li> This mask is very poorly made it came with very little of the green filler in the mask this mask is made for a 7 year old head.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, THEIR TIME TO PACK IT, OR DELIVER IT.</li>
    <li> This mask has little to no gel at all, I went to the local CVS and got a good one instead.. disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye packs, this is the thinnest one I have even seen.Very cheap quality, wont not have got this even for a 1$.</li>
    <li> Look I know the say you get what you pay for but this  had a horrible quality. Virtually no gel , flimsy and the plastic seams were coarse to boot.</li>
    <li> There was another gel eye mask of a similar price and the only reason why I opted for these instead was because it was an add on item, so shipping was free with my order. These things arrived in cheap packaging, and the gel was completely dried out. Do not waste your money! I wish I read the reviews before I bought these, but my mistake was in figuring one was as good as another!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with the bags under my eyes but this didn&#x27;t help. The string that you wrap around your head also seems to come out easily.</li>
