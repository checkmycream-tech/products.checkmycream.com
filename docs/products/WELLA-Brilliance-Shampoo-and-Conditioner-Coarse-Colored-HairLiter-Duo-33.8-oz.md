      <li>My hair is dyed pink and using the conditioner allows you to infuse your hair with their wonderful fragrance without washing out the dye.  </li>
      <li>It is a decent product but not quite as good as the Humectress.  </li>

      <li>as not only do I want a quality product, it MUST smell great</li>
      <li>I love it and certainly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Conditioner is really rich</li>
      <li>I have very fine straight hair, but my ends almost frizz as though they want to curl, but isn&#x27;t allowed.  </li>
      <li>Great shine and feel to my long hair!</li>
      <li>I wanted a shampoo and conditioner to clean my hair, not make it greasy.</li>

      <li>Good price and exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>This stuff smells awesome, but for my very dry, coarse hair, it wasn&#x27;t as effective as other products I have tried.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Another favorite of mine and I can get it for less than local beauty supply store.  And I am pickya bout my hair products..as not only do I want a quality product, it MUST smell great or I refuse to use it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is awesome. I spend hundreds coloring my hair and it keeps the color longer. Smells lovely as well. Conditioner is really rich so you do not need much. I have long, thick hair and I go through nearly a bottle and a half of shampoo before I need to replace the conditioner.</li>
    <li> This purchase was for a friend and so far, she likes it.</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy hair, this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner! I have dry over processed frizzy hair and this shampoo and conditioner make my hair manageable and easy to brush out!! Great quality and the larger bottles are great!</li>
    <li> Although my hair seems to be soft and manageable, the shampoo does not lather up at all. I thought it was the transition to a new shampoo at first, but I have used it now for over six weeks. Consequently I had to use large quantities to work it into my hair. It did not seem to be worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner. Makes my hair smooth and keeps my color fresh. It also smells great.</li>
    <li> As described . Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Got turned on to this shampoo by my hairdresser.  My hair is curly, dry and almost 50% gray and colored red.  Redheads know that is the hardest color to keep from washing out and getting brassy.  Wella Brilliance does just that....or rather it DOESN&#x27;T.  I can go from coloring to coloring without getting that faded, washed out look.  It moisturizes wonderfully, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look dry and frazzled.  .</li>
    <li> I personally can not vouch for the properties because I purchased this for my wife. But she states that this is one of the few products she will use, so second hand I recommend this product. It was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I usually use Nexxus Humectress on my dry, coarse hair but thought I would give this a try.  It is a decent product but not quite as good as the Humectress.  Also, I like the pump bottles and these do not have them.</li>
    <li> I had proved several products for my colored hair and always got poor results but now my hair looks better than never</li>
    <li> Great product and resonably priced. My wife loves this product for her hair. No complaints at all, smells great as well.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it so I like it. Even I can tell the difference in her hair. Will order and recommend again.</li>
    <li> Wella Brilliance Shampoo &amp; Conditioner leaves my hair feeling so clean, soft, shiny, and it smells wonderful too! I was introduced to it at the salon I go to! I love it and certainly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my stylist, their salon sold two small tubes for the same price.  The product works very well.  We have well water and my color fades quickly... this product helps to stop the fade, suds well for my hard water and leaves my hair in great condition.</li>
    <li> These products work really with my Asian hair, which is thick, coarse &amp; damaged and dried.&lt;br /&gt;I really like these for daily use, but still my hair needs additional conditioner or serum.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner for coarse hair</li>
    <li> BY FAR HANDS DOWN THE BEST PRODUCT FOR MY HAIR....WHAT IMPRESSED ME THE MOST BESIDES THE RESULTS OF MY HAIR IS THAT I BOUGHT MY FIRST BOTTLE OF EACH LAST JANUARY AND NOW IN DECEMBER THEY ARE JUST BEING FINSIHED. WHO EVER HEARD OF SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER LASTING THAT LONG...YOU JUST USE A LITTLE AND IT REALLY IS GREAT FOR YOUR HAIR</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very nice and I go through this quickly. Helps save my color from the salon. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Love!  I&#x27;ve been using almost a month now and everyone compliments on my hair! &amp;#34;Did you get a trim?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Did you color?&amp;#34;  My hair is so much healthier and SHINY now. Even my split ends don&#x27;t look so frayed.  Will definitely rebuy!</li>
    <li> Is a good brand of hair product, smells good.</li>
    <li> Not only is this great for colored hair,  but it also softens coarse hair!  Will be the only product I use going forward.  Smells great!  Can&#x27;t find this in stores, and if you did I&#x27;m sure the price would be a lot more than buying it here!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my mother she absolutely loves this. She pays much more for a way smaller bottle at the salon.</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse hair which is highlighted and this produce works great. Leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product when I was looking for something different. I have long, thick, coarse, color treated hair.  I use this and leave in balm by the same company and receive compliments on how shiny my hair is.  Even after I straighten  it.  Will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> I liked shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is good and smell too.</li>
    <li> Probably the best smelling smampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. A little bit drying though.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome, but for my very dry, coarse hair, it wasn&#x27;t as effective as other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I actually have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair that is crazy right now from copious amounts of bleach. My stylist recommended the reconstructive elixir from Wella and it was so magical that I went on a Wella shopping spree. This product didn&#x27;t disappoint - it turned my cotton candy fuzz into HAIR. It&#x27;s actually too soft now and lays a little too flat but I&#x27;m not blaming the product because I don&#x27;t have thick course hair. Like the other Wella products, this smells amazing. I will by purchasing this shampoo and conditioner for thin to normal hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner is the BEST PRODUCT I have ever used in ENTIRE LIFE! Wow, it literally revived my dry coarse color-treated hair, and it even after the very first wash! It feels like I just came back from the salon every time I blow it out, and it took me half the time it normally does to dry it...I used to use the Moroccan oil volume shampoo, and this Wella product blows that out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
    <li> My Dove shampoo/cond work better than these overpriced hair products. Extremely disappointed especially the expense!</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister &amp; she LOVES it! Keeps her hair looking more brighten &amp; does keeping the color from fading. Highly recommend this is you color your hair a lot. The smell is nice too.</li>
    <li> Works well on my coarse, wavy, colored hair.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> The WELLA Brilliance Shampoo was good and the conditioner was good.  I do not feel that it was worth all the money that I spent on the product.  My hair has not had a lot of change to texture.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well on colored hair.</li>
    <li> We love this combo, all we use!</li>
    <li> My salon uses this shampoo and conditioner so i followed suit.  Works great and leaves my hair silky!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BE FOOLED THIS PRODUCT IS FAKE!!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ITS TERRIBLE FOR YOUR HAIR. SELLER WILL NOT ALLOW RETURNS</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! My hair feel so soft and it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Nice smell.  Nothing spectacular but does the job.</li>
    <li> The smell is so nice, I just like to smell this stuff. It has also helped my course, dry and damaged hair as well. I have Hispanic textured hair. Its naturally curly and puffy. After straightening it so much and using hair coloring it has gotten so damaged to the point of being mushy spaghetti type hair. Using protein treatments and Wella moisturizing treatments I have restored my hair. Now I use this conditioner to keep it soft, shiny, and manageable. Thanks Wella</li>
    <li> When my hair stylist recommended it, I knew I could find it cheaper on Amazon (which was in fact true).  I love it and will order more.  I put my hair through a lot of coloring and my hair actually looks healthier now.  I get compliments all the time about how bouncy and healthy my hair now is.  I feel like it&#x27;s reversed all the damage I&#x27;ve done.  I would recommend this 100%.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! I used to pay way more in the salon! So happy found for better price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!! Makes my hair feel so much softer &amp; looks healthier ! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more !!!! It has brought new life to my hair</li>
    <li> I love Wella. My hair is shine and looks really beautiful after I used Wella. I have been useing it for long time and highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Pretty good on my coarse-colored hair but was not the miracle I was hoping for unfortunately....but with the Arran oil I apply after...not bad results...smells like koolaid.</li>
    <li> Good price and exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Love love this shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> I have coarse thick hair and haven&#x27;t seen a shampoo/conditioner specifically for my hair until I came across Wella! The duo was reasonably priced and smells fantastic! I always change up my shampoo/conditioner once it runs out but I&#x27;m planning on reordering Wella</li>
    <li> It has a strange smell, unlike the original ones you get from the salon or Ulta. Not the real thing!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years, and it has never failed to take care of my hair, especially after i use color products on my hair.  If you need something to bring your hair to life &amp; have a nice smell after then this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Was excited to buy this product becuase the description was a perfect fit for my hair type. After a few days of use, it started to leave my hair greasy. I wanted a shampoo and conditioner to clean my hair, not make it greasy. I gave to my sister-in-law and she loves it. Works great for her.</li>
    <li> If you use keratin, the conditioner is all you can use to keep your locks soft and beautiful! Great shine and feel to my long hair!</li>
    <li> Particularly love the conditioner. Keeps my hair soft and detangled</li>
    <li> Love this. it smells great and works great on color treated hair.  Definitely worth it in my opinion. Will be buying more</li>
    <li> I worked at a store in a beauty supply store for a while and got to try this product free and loved it and have bought it multiple times since.</li>
    <li> I have colored and curly hair and this shampoo was the best one I have tried. My hair looks healthier and with a brilliant color. The conditioner leaves a wonderful smell as well.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing I do not like on it.</li>
    <li> A hair stylist recommended me this product and I have been using it for almost 2 years and love it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner made my hair smell wonderful.  You can wash your hair with the conditioner alone, which is what I did.  My hair is dyed pink and using the conditioner allows you to infuse your hair with their wonderful fragrance without washing out the dye.  I use the shampoo occasionally when I&#x27;ve put hairspray or other product in my hair for styling, otherwise, I wash and go with the conditioner only.  I&#x27;ve had many compliments about how wonderful my hair smells whenever I let my wet hair out of the bun.</li>
    <li> I have always had very course, dry, brittle, damaged hair. ALWAYS. I&#x27;ve been a brunette for years and NEVER colored my hair because it was bad enough already, and I feared coloring it would just make it that much worse. Well I finally gave in and put blonde highlights in my hair, which I absolutely LOVE, and after doing so I purchased this shampoo and conditioner to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is INCREDIBLE! I am in absolute awe of how silky smooth and healthy my hair looks and feels. My hair has literally never looked better. I first purchased the smaller set at ulta to try it out, and as soon as it was halfway done, I came on here to order the larger set! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch to another line of products. It also smells fabulous, which is another very important factor in choosing hair products for me! If I could give this product 10 stars, I most certainly would :)</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all</li>

    <li> My sister gave me the Wella Shampoo and Conditioner for Coarse hair for my birthday. I use to think that pretty much shampoo was shampoo but I&#x27;ve been using this for months and my hair actually feels soft and looks silky. I get compliments all the time and now am going to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo conditioner duo. Not heavy but still feels soft and healthy. Will order again from this seller!</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair, but my ends almost frizz as though they want to curl, but isn&#x27;t allowed.  I usually have to use a curling iron to give my hair body and straighten the ends.  With the Wella, even though it is for &amp;#34;Coarse Hair&amp;#34;, it works wonders and I do not have to use a curling iron, which is healthier for my hair anyway.  YEAH!</li>
