<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is outstanding.  It brings back life to your skin by rejuvenating it and adding subtle texture changes.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am so excited you are caring the Impress facial pads.  I have used this product for about a year. People always compliment me on my skin. That has never happened before in my whole life. I have given this a a gift to my sister and a few close friends. They have thanked me over and over, saying they get that same result of people complimenting them on their skin. I am glad you are carrying it because I can&#x27;t always get to their office. What a fantastic product!!!</li>
    <li> In the last 25 years  I have never come across a more simple and effective system!  I am a mother of 7, I can do this with out even thinking ! The results are amazing too!  Everyone has noticed how much younger I look... And I am a sun lover !  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Impress facial pads for about one year now. My skin has never looked better. For years I bought serums and creams that never fullfilled their promise.  My skin never changed. When I started with Impress skin care I immediately knew it was different from anything else I had ever tried. I simply use the convienient individualized pad on my face, neck and the back of my hands. There are three different pads placed in the order you will use them in one box. Something so genius and so simple. The best part is the results. I&#x27;m 52 and my skin actually has a youthful glow. Honestly this really is the only anti-aging product you need.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Impress Anti-aging Facial Pads for two years and my face has never looked better.  The peel pad leaves your skip glowing the next day.  The firming pad makes you feel younger and the soothing pad does just that, calms your skin.  I am very happy with this product and the results I have seen.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very beneficial. I am a male and an active cyclist. The summer sun is very hard on my skin and these pads have done wonders for the facial lines and dryness that I have accrued over the years.  I use the Impress Facial Cleanser and then the pads as my daily routine. Just wipe and go. So easy to use and well worth it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these pads!  I have used them for a couple of years and they are amazing, it is like getting a facial every week!  My schedule is very busy and I dont have the time to have treatments done on my face regularly, it is ok because these pads do the work.  They are a critical part of my regime and I would rather give up a meal or dinner out than go without the impress pads!  You will love them and people will notice your face and ask what you are doing differently.  The best beauty secret out there!</li>
    <li> I love IMPRESS! I have never written a review but feel compelled to let others know how great this product has been for me. Impress pads are easy to use and inexpensive. Instead of countless bottles and forgettable instructions, this product requires one step at night and your done. I have never received compliments on my skin. However, since using Impress over the last year, many people have asked what I was doing because my skin looked so good. Impress pads have surpassed my expectations and are so effective I have 3 boxes hoarded in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> My skin glows after using these pads for only 3 weeks. SIMPLE: It is so easy because you take the top pad each day so you don&#x27;t have to think, &amp;#34;Did I do a peel yesterday or was that 2 days ago?&amp;#34; Its all set up in order for the perfect skin care regimen. QUICK: You slip your fingers into the pocket of the pad, peel off the seal of the pad and wipe it all over your face and neck. THAT&#x27;S IT! This takes the place of an entire drawer full of different lotions, and treatments and masques. I feel like I could just throw almost everything else away. EFFECTIVE: You can feel immediately that the product is working. (I use them at night right before bed and I wake up with skin looking better than the day before.) My skin has a glow that I haven&#x27;t seen in years. (I&#x27;m 39 years old.) Other people have commented on how good my skin looks. I feel great! I am hooked on these and I&#x27;m telling all of my friends about it!! THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 62 years old and still hadn&#x27;t found a facial product and program I liked and have stuck with. I now use the Impress Anti-aging pads daily and really love them. I had a dime size dark place on my face that really bothered me. Last night it just peeled off. I&#x27;m so happy. I don&#x27;t have dead skin dulling my complexion and clogging my pores. The Impress pads have cut my nighttime program down by half.  Now I just wash my face and use the top pad. Every morning my face looks and feels healthy and I have a natural glow that I didn&#x27;t have before.  My favorite place to purchase the Impress pads is at RX Skin Clinic in Scottsdale AZ.</li>
    <li> As a Guy, I recommend this product.  It Great, has improved my facial skin...my grand daughters like rubbing my face, they say it is so smooth grampy thom...Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> You cannot find an easier and/or more effective product out there!!!!  I&#x27;m in the over 65 years group so I wasn&#x27;t sure how much help these pads could give me, but my skin has truly not looked this great since my early 50&#x27;s.  That sun damage DOES find it&#x27;s way to the top and it&#x27;s not pretty, but my skin looks and feels so soft now -- Goodbye big pores and roughness!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, the one-pad-a-day application (they come out the box in order) makes it so easy to do, it has kept me on track daily, which hasn&#x27;t  always been the case.  This product is very reasonably priced and what it can do for your skin and self-confidence is amazing and, I feel that the longer I use the product the better the results.  After decades of trying about every system out there, I&#x27;ve never had anything work as well or be as easy to use.  This is the ONE to get!!!</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with the Impress FacialPads. What an ingenious way to make your skin care easy! The pads fit nicely over your fingers and make your daily facial care a breeze. You don&#x27;t have to worry about which product to use as they are all stacked neatly in the box and ready to use. They are excellent for traveling, no more jars and security worries! I have never had more compliments on my skin! I am over 50 and live and work in the sun and they have been a live saver for my skin! I admit I was skeptical  at first. Over the years I have used many high end products, but none have had the noticeable results for me like this product. My husband is also using them now as he wants to benefit from them as well and it shows!</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old and after just two weeks of using this product people started to notice how great my skin looked and the compliments haven&#x27;t stopped.  I&#x27;ve even been told that I&#x27;m aging backwards!! My skin has tightened, my fine lines have been minimized and my sun spots have lightened significantly.  Over the years, I have tried many expensive products that promise great results but haven&#x27;t delivered or have caused my skin to break out.  Impress is the easiest and most effective facial product I have ever used. I recommend this product to any man or woman that is looking to achieve younger healthier skin.  Impress is truly an amazing product!!&lt;br /&gt;Sent from my iPad</li>
    <li> The Impress anti-aging pad system is a simple and effective way to keep your complexion perfection!  I have used the series for years and have given it as gifts to my children and to friends.  Everyone loves it!  The products work and you get results with a minimum of effort and it is less expensive than many other products.  It is also perfect for travel because you can take only what you need.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I have found that stops my seborrheic keratosis from growing on my skin.  I used to have my dermatologist burn off these leasons once or twice a year.  Now, my skin is healthy and free from these growths.  The product is very easy to use at home and while traveling.  (I know it is the pads that stop the lesions from growing because I have stopped using the pads in the past and the lesions come back right away.)</li>
    <li> I love the Impress anti aging facial pads.  We have our grandson in the evenings; in the rush to get the home work done, the reading done, I just grab the next in line pad and I&#x27;ve off to read level two books.  Great for traveling but more importantly, my skin looks so much better and I no longer have to search for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; product...it&#x27;s already in my bathroom cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
    <li> This is the best facial product I have ever used!  I have been using these pads for a couple of years now and I will never use anything else ever again!  Simple, convenient, and they work!  I am 55 years old and am frequently told I look a lot younger than I am.  How can you not like that???  Don&#x27;t waste any more money on other products. Get these pads!</li>
    <li> I love these pads!  They&#x27;re simple, easy to use and portable.  I&#x27;m taking a supply with me on vacation this year.  My skin has never looked so good and I&#x27;m in my upper 60&#x27;s!  Total strangers comment on what  a beautiful, fresh and clear complexion I have.  I&#x27;m so very pleased with this product and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended these pads to me, and I have to say I LOVE..LOVE them! it is everything you need for anti-aging put on disposable pads all in one convenient box. My skin looks so clear and healthy, and the pores on my nose have disappeared! No facial has ever done that. I travel for work and I am thrilled to take this product with me. I go for 3-4 days and I just grab the top 3-4 pads, throw then in my handbag and off I go. So simple and affordable, I replaced 6 items on my bathroom counter with one box of Impress! Thank you for simplifying my life.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s easy, affordable and it works! I&#x27;ve used this product for years and now it&#x27;s finally on Amazon. Yeah!!!  I used to waste so much money on products big on promise and low on results. I also don&#x27;t have the time to stand in front of the mirror putting on one cream after another. Why does every skin care company expect me to apply so many things? I never knew what worked, so I ended up putting a million different products on to make sure I was doing whatever I needed to do. You should have seen my my vanity. Loads of expensive half-used products everywhere. Then I found this one step a day routine that makes my skin look the best its ever looked. I just wipe a pad and throw it away. No time! So simple! Once I started using these pads I wondered why it took so long for anyone to figure this out? Needless to say, I&#x27;m so glad I found these pads!! I have all my sisters using the pads and not one of them would live without them. I always was the smartest kid in the family! LOL :)</li>
    <li> I am a licensed aesthetician for nearly 20 years. I regularly apply the peeling pad from the Impress box of pads to my clients skin. Our office charges $125 to perform a chemical peel at our medical skin care clinic. My clients absolutely love the pads! After I apply the peel pad, the client takes the remaining box of pads home with them. You get 4 peel pads in each box, enough for a month of weekly salon level peels plus 12 collagen growing retinol pads and 12 soothing and protecting anti-oxidant serum pads. This is the most amazing easy skin care system I have ever seen!  I no longer feel guilty recommending my clients buy one of those expensive 6-15 steps product lines. Now they have everything they need in one affordable and convenient box! One pad per day; you won&#x27;t find an easier routine out there. This easily replaces tons of expensive products!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and efficient.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product!!!!  It is so simple to use and produces amazing results.  Instead of using 10 different products to obtain minimal results you use a different pad daily and you get incredible results!  I even use it on my hands and chest to reduce aging spots.  I am 49 years old, and my friends and family are always asking me what I am doing.  A few have even asked if I have had surgery.  I have been using the pads for over a year and will continue using them because of the results I have had and the ease of use.  Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using these pads for years. The manufacturrer changed the packaging about a year ago and it is amazing. 30 pads per box in a rotating cycle. Skin care regiment made easy. They are so great to travel with and very affordable. I typically buy a 90 day supply. They have a good shelf life...about 2 years. This really is a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED MY IMPRESS ANTI-AGING FACIAL PAD PROGRAM FOR ONE MONTH NOW AND AM HOOKED FOR LIFE.  MY SENSITIVE SKIN LOVES THE EFFECT AND FEEL AFTER USING THEM EACH NIGHT, AND I LOVE THE LOOKS OF MY NEW GLOWING AND SMOOTHER AND FIRMER SKIN.  I HAVE GOTTEN COMPLIMENTS ON MY SKIN THIS MONTH AND THE PADS ARE MY SECRET!!!  I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO WASH MY FACE AND APPLY THE HEALING PADS EVERY EVENING!!!  I AWAKEN THE NEXT MORNING LOOKING BETTER EACH DAY.  THIS PRODUCT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR SO LONG AND  IS THE ANSWER TO MY PRAYERS.  I PLAN ON GIVING THIS PRESENT TO MY LOVED ONES FOR CHRISTMAS- THE PERFECT GIFT!!!  TRULY A GIFT FROM GOD!!!</li>
    <li> Love these pads.  I was introduced to these pads about 1 year ago.  Because of the rotation between peel, soothe and firming, my skin never gets irritated... and I have very sensitive skin.  They leave my skin feeling soft, smooth and refreshed.  They are very easy to use and add no additional time to my morning routine.  Plus, there is enough product to use on the face AND the neck.  Unlike getting a facial, this is an on-going program that helps to keep your skin looking it&#x27;s best.</li>
    <li> For well over a year I have been dealing with a skin condition (seborrheic dermatitis) on the bridge of my nose, between my eyebrows.  My dermatologist has had me on a variety of medicines to control it and told me it would never go away completely.  I have been taking docyclycline and tried several different prescription topical medicines.  At its worst, it was blistery, bumpy, itched horribly and was very red.  At its best it was bumpy but still itched.  I tried the pads for my overall complexion, and, lucky me, I had the unintended consequence of this horrible skin condition disappearing completely.  Of course, my overall complexion is improving too and I just purchased my second month of pads.  As corny as it sounds, getting rid of this rash is a miracle!</li>
