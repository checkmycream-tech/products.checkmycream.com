<li> I mean really...</li>
<li> Eventhough it&#x27;s only 2g, it lasts extremely long as you only use a small amount for coverage.  </li>
<li> because this was not the regular size i purchase at ulta, I paid less not realizing it.  </li>
<li> there is actually a pitiful amount of the stuff IN the little jar.</li>
<li> Also, the amount you use for application is so small that it&#x27;s lasting longer than I expected.  </li>
<li> It is small like their blush.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff. I have been using BB Minerals for years, I didn&#x27;t keep up with my supply and ran out...SO SAD&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;but now I am happy..yay for BB</li>
    <li> AS ALWAYS I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. THE COVERAGE IS GREAT AND SO LIGHT THAT U CAN SLEEP IN IT. I AM HOOKED ON BARE MINERALS...</li>
    <li> It feel great on my skin and it&#x27;s very easy to apply.  Gives me a nice, clean, fresh look.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Nice trial size of a great product!  I&#x27;ve always been curious to try this brand but was concerned about a possible reaction as my skin is really sensitive.  For this reason I didn&#x27;t want to order the whole kit and waste product and money if I had to toss it.  This small container was a great way to sample the product, brand, and color.  I am very happy with it!  No negative reaction, good coverage, and great match to my olive skin.  Also, the amount you use for application is so small that it&#x27;s lasting longer than I expected.  Overall great experience, I will definitely be purchasing more Bare Minerals products.</li>
    <li> I just received my order yesterday and it is amazing  and the shipping is fast will be order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I am a light brown skinned female with a neutral skin tone. I have tried so many Bare Escentuals foundations to get to the correct one. The tan shade is perfect. I am sure most women of color don&#x27;t know that the tan shade works the best on light skinned african american tones; as well as some darker hispanics, and Indians. This shade is wonderful.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;tan\\&quot; foundation beautifully compliments my \\&quot;medium tan\\&quot; foundation and it appears that I am not wearing any makeup at all.  Eventhough it&#x27;s only 2g, it lasts extremely long as you only use a small amount for coverage.  Once you find your shade, you will be sold!</li>
    <li> container smaller than I expected but overall very satisfied with product</li>
    <li> I LOVED MY BARE ESCENTUALS TAN FOUNDATION MAKEUP. I RECEIVED IT FAST! I WILL REMEMBER THIS COMPANY THE NEXT TIME I ORDER MY MAKEUP!</li>
    <li> I normally use the medium throughout the year until summer. I get tan from outdoor activity.  The nice thing about Mineral makeup is that you can blend some of your lighter color with this if it&#x27;s too dark for you.  It goes a long way. this is not the large size. It is small like their blush. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The product was factory sealed. I bought this to try bare minerals and it was okay. The color was way lighter than shown. It was more a medium beige than a tan.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It is so great! This powder is way better then any cream foundation. It last longer then the cream foundation I was using.</li>
    <li> Love Bare Minerals foundation... been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Same product as you would purchase at Ulta or anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Love it! Could never use liquid foundation again.</li>
    <li> Love Bare Minerals powder foundation.  It&#x27;s not heavy, skin still feels clean at end of day.  Doesn&#x27;t cause blemishes.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff and the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 starts is that for one, it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;factory sealed&amp;#34; and 2. there is actually a pitiful amount of the stuff IN the little jar. I mean really... for the amount of $ paid for this product someone could stick enough IN the jar so that you could feel you were actually getting something. that&#x27;s my take on that! lol</li>
    <li> because this was not the regular size i purchase at ulta, I paid less not realizing it.  It also did not come w a twist cap, so the powder is all over the place.  I would never order it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years it cover imperfictions really well and&lt;br /&gt;it looks very natural .  Does not cake</li>
