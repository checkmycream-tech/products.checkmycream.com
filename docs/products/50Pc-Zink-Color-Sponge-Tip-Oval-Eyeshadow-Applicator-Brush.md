      <li>If I do get to that point, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review.  </li>
      <li>I would like best, so I bought a palette with a lot of colors of eyeshadow -- only to find it didn&#x27;t come with any applicators!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Excellent product couldn&#x27;t find in local stores.</li>
      <li>I would look for a better quality applicator.</li>
      <li>Love them and will buy again for sure.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what color(s)</li>
      <li>I like sponges that are sturdier and just a bit more porous for a smooth, blended application.</li>
      <li>Bottom line, they do the job and are cheap, what more can you ask??</li>
      <li>Cheap, good quality, large quantity.  </li>
      <li>They pick up eyeshadow from the palette easily, and they spread it smoothly and evenly over my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>I used these for a makeup party and they worked just fine.</li>
      <li>These little brushes are perfect for my eye shadow.  </li>
      <li>I tried to choose the option from my Amazon Order History page to return or replace the item for the correct product, and the page told me that neither option was available.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always good to have back ups :)</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t cheaply made, and with one rinse it was clean again.</li>
      <li>I was even able to clean these off pretty well</li>
      <li>Great not only for eyeshadow application but to do fun nail art with.</li>
      <li>I purchased these because they seem to get a lot of positive reviews, but I gotta say I am less than impressed.</li>
      <li>The price for the quantity seems pretty good, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay a little more for a better product.</li>
      <li>Also,the quality is good enough for the price.</li>
      <li>They seem pretty securely fastened to the plastic handles.  </li>
      <li>Pretty flimsy cheap quality.</li>
      <li>I greatly prefer this method over a high priced eyeshadow brush for simply putting the color on the lid.</li>
      <li>They work fine and are slightly less quality then you might get from a make up kit, but better than most throw away type brushes.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>When I received them, I could see through the clear plastic bag they came in that these are very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I actually bought them while I was considering doing my own &#x27;obmbre&#x27; type nails, but have ended up using them for some make up</li>
      <li>Good stuff, worked as expected.</li>
      <li>Overall a nice product.</li>
      <li>Good for applying eyeshadow, but you just have to be careful with them.</li>
      <li>Price is right as well.</li>
      <li>the sponge tip looks like it would slip right off the moment you try to swipe it.</li>
      <li>Most applicators are too big, but these are not.</li>
      <li>Theses are exactly what I needed</li>
      <li>any rate, the price for these applicators was right, and there were a lot of them in the package (a fairly high quality zipper pouch, by the way).  </li>
      <li>Works great so far &amp; is small enough to fit in the eyeshadow containers I use.  </li>
      <li>Pretty decent quality considering the price.</li>
      <li>I liked the little bag they came in.</li>
      <li>If you are expecting to only use these a few times they are a great value...  </li>
      <li>like and the eye shadow didn&#x27;t stick to them very well.</li>
      <li>you just can&#x60;t really see the &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>thanks 👌</li>
      <li>These are very sturdy and hold up well to my abuse.  </li>
      <li>great price for 50 pieces, a little stiff and not as soft as I&#x27;d like, works okay.</li>
      <li>I just clean them and store them with the pad upward until the next time I wear that color.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that the foam tip can come off if using some force to clean and once they get some gunk on them.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find something to clean all my diecast with~found right product with these!!</li>
      <li>I use them to apply my Bare Escentuals loose powder eyeshadow and they do a faster and more thorough job than a brush...</li>
      <li>I bought these for a different reason than intended, so I can only speak to those who would buy these to help clean their airbrush: don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>The applicators actually looked a little better (to me) in person than they did in the picture on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>average nothing special</li>
      <li>Not so soft but does what it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>Thanks, these are basic sponge applicators.  </li>
      <li>These eyeshadow applicators are ok for the price but after only a few uses the sponge part falls off.  </li>
      <li>I have bought several different ones trying to find ones that do right.</li>
      <li>However, for basic use (including for eye makeup beginners like myself), I think these are a pretty solid</li>
      <li>I have worn glasses for most of the last 30 years, so I usually just didn&#x27;t bother with eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>The ones you can buy at the stores are cheap and fall apart after only a few applications.  </li>
      <li>That being said, I really don&#x27;t feel these are such a big deal at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> That is a good thing.  I just wish the handles were a bit longer.  I know a lot of cases are too small to hold longer ones, but my preference is not these shorter ones.</li>
    <li> arrived fast great quality</li>
    <li> Thanks, these are basic sponge applicators.  I actually bought them while I was considering doing my own &#x27;obmbre&#x27; type nails, but have ended up using them for some make up I bought that did not include applicators.  They work fine and are slightly less quality then you might get from a make up kit, but better than most throw away type brushes.  Bottom line, they do the job and are cheap, what more can you ask??</li>
    <li> average nothing special</li>
    <li> Sponge stays on the stick. It doesn&#x27;t come off after a few uses. Applicator lasts as long as the eye shadow, unlike the one that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
    <li> I purchased these because they seem to get a lot of positive reviews, but I gotta say I am less than impressed. It might seem silly to write a review about something as simple as a sponge-tip eyeshadow applicator, but with makeup, brushes, sponges, etc, quality is somewhat important. I greatly prefer this method over a high priced eyeshadow brush for simply putting the color on the lid. That being said, I really don&#x27;t feel these are such a big deal at all. When I received them, I could see through the clear plastic bag they came in that these are very cheaply made. On nearly every single one the sponge tip looks like it would slip right off the moment you try to swipe it. The cut is irregular and the sponge itself is thin. I tested at least ten of them with different highly pigmented eyeshadows on the back of my hand, and for the most part the application was sheer. I also tested with various primers. These sponges are not very porous, which makes for a softer feel on the skin. I like sponges that are sturdier and just a bit more porous for a smooth, blended application. The quality of these applicators suggest they are for one-time use, not worth washing them. The price for the quantity seems pretty good, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay a little more for a better product.</li>
    <li> The sponges are holding up without getting shabby or leaving tiny little fuzzies all over.  Cheap, good quality, large quantity.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I am very pleased with the applicators. I have used about fifteen of them for different colors and I have yet to have one come apart. I just clean them and store them with the pad upward until the next time I wear that color. At this rate it will be a long time before I run out of them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK for the price. Not so soft but does what it is supposed to. I would still recommend it though.&lt;br /&gt;How many times has your sponge broken or ripped apart because of extended use? It&#x27;s always good to have back ups :)</li>
    <li> These are very sturdy and hold up well to my abuse.  The ones you can buy at the stores are cheap and fall apart after only a few applications.  These are the best.</li>
    <li> I AM A MAKEUP ARTIST AND THESE ARE perfect for clients when you dont have brushes and do not want to use them on clients</li>
    <li> These are cheap and thin and too big to store in an average size shadow compact.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a different reason than intended, so I can only speak to those who would buy these to help clean their airbrush: don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll say up front that I am no expert when it comes to eye makeup.  I have worn glasses for most of the last 30 years, so I usually just didn&#x27;t bother with eye makeup.  However, earlier this year, I got contact lenses, so I recently decided to give eye makeup a try again.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what color(s) I would like best, so I bought a palette with a lot of colors of eyeshadow -- only to find it didn&#x27;t come with any applicators!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, the price for these applicators was right, and there were a lot of them in the package (a fairly high quality zipper pouch, by the way).  The applicators actually looked a little better (to me) in person than they did in the picture on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose a handful randomly from the package and pulled (lightly) on the applicator parts.  They seem pretty securely fastened to the plastic handles.  They pick up eyeshadow from the palette easily, and they spread it smoothly and evenly over my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;m still at the point where I&#x27;m only doing single colors of eyeshadow, so I can&#x27;t speak to anything relating to blending.  If I do get to that point, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review.  However, for basic use (including for eye makeup beginners like myself), I think these are a pretty solid choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note 2: The Food and Drug Administration recommends throwing out powder eye shadows after 2 years or after you&#x27;ve had an eye infection.  I assume this applies to the sponge-tip applicators, too (if you are not cleaning them regularly).  At the price you pay for these applicators, you won&#x27;t feel too badly about disposing of them when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, good quality, good price, good shipping.</li>
    <li> These eyeshadow applicators are ok for the price but after only a few uses the sponge part falls off.  I would look for a better quality applicator.</li>
    <li> All of my eye shadow applicators starting falling apart at the same time.  I have bought several different ones trying to find ones that do right. These were ok, but they were kind of plastic like and the eye shadow didn&#x27;t stick to them very well. they&#x27;ll do if your in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Good value for what you get - purchased for my wife&#x27;s Mary Kay business and she says this is a good deal compared to what else is out there. Because these are disposable, you don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on them!</li>
    <li> If you are expecting to only use these a few times they are a great value...  I use them to apply my Bare Escentuals loose powder eyeshadow and they do a faster and more thorough job than a brush...</li>
    <li> Great, hygienic way to apply eyeshadow. Very happy with the shape and surface.  Works great.  Price is right as well.</li>
    <li> They were smaller than I expected and did not have a tip both ends.</li>
    <li> Theses are exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> These are great for eye cream and you can use one for both eyes.  Good for eye shadow as well.</li>
    <li> 50 Sponge for this price ?!  I Still can&#x27;t believe it !.. Also,the quality is good enough for the price.</li>
    <li> Hard to find something to clean all my diecast with~found right product with these!! THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> Pretty decent quality considering the price. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased these worrying about the reviews I read and that they would be sub-par. I shouldn&#x27;t have worried, these are great. They are solidly attached to the plastic end and soft. The plastic is tapered out so it fits in my fingers perfectly. Plus, there are 50 of them! If one doesn&#x27;t work you still have 49 others to replace it with!</li>
    <li> Buy the white ones. I bought these for cleaning guns and they work great. I also, mistakenly bought the same items in black tips, from the photos you couldn&#x60;t tell they were the same. The only problem with the black tips is that you can&#x60;t tell how dirty they are. They work as well you just can&#x60;t really see the &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34;. I would and will buy the white ones again.</li>
    <li> These are very nice applicators for the price. They do a good job of applying makeup evenly. I like how they are small enough to help control the amount of makeup you are applying. Will be buying more of these when I run out! Very pleased.</li>
    <li> These little brushes are perfect for my eye shadow.  They fit inside the eye shadow cassettes so nicely, so I have one for each color!  No more sharing brushes between colors!!  Wal-Mart had 3 or 4 sponge brushes for sale for $4, and I got 50 for about the same price! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I used these for a makeup party and they worked just fine. I liked the little bag they came in.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, they apply eye shadow perfectly and evenly. Love them and will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find these in the stores.  I love the shape.  I can find the rounder ones, but I like the sponges with a slight point.</li>
    <li> Wish they were longer, but otherwise they do the trick.</li>
    <li> Excellent product couldn&#x27;t find in local stores. The were as described and&lt;br /&gt;arrived in two days. Wife could not be happier</li>
    <li> Just what I needed...used one of them and the brush itself is very good, and held fast. Isn&#x27;t cheaply made, and with one rinse it was clean again. I think I&#x27;ll have these for a while. They are small (take notice), as big as a pinkie finger, but it fits into my eyeshadow cases perfectly so no complaints!</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy...handy to have.  Better than some others I&#x27;ve bought, for sure!  Good price.</li>
    <li> These work great in my sample handouts for my biz!</li>
    <li> Brushes are great, but I love these spongies for their smooth application and blending. Good ones are becoming scarce, so I&#x27;m really glad I found these.</li>
    <li> The package labeling indicated the contents were &amp;#34;50Pc Zink Color Sponge Tip Oval Eyeshadow Applicator Brush&amp;#34;.  However, the contents were plastic make up spatulas, not the sponge tip applicators.  I tried to choose the option from my Amazon Order History page to return or replace the item for the correct product, and the page told me that neither option was available.  I will NOT order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Good applicators for the price</li>
    <li> Good stuff, worked as expected. the makeup applied well to my eyes, will buy again. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The aren&#x27;t the best or the worst.  I had to cut down the handles to fit in my cases and the foam is a bit stiff but they do work.</li>
    <li> Pretty flimsy cheap quality. Doesn&#x27;t hold shadow at all. Very hard to get a smooth application. Sponge tipped are better.</li>
    <li> Used it for cleaning guns and such.  Work well.  The only problem is that the foam tip can come off if using some force to clean and once they get some gunk on them.  Overall a nice product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t always be deceived by quantity. I ordered these thinking they would be like the ones I got at Target. When I saw them, I thought what a deal because at Target you get like 20 for $2. These don&#x27;t do a good job of applying eyeshadow at all. I tried wetting one of them, and it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> Great not only for eyeshadow application but to do fun nail art with.</li>
    <li> I use these for my glitter cream eye shadow. They work great and the amount for the price was very good. I was even able to clean these off pretty well so I could use them without having to worry about clumps or dry cream. I will order again when I need them for sure.</li>
    <li> great price for 50 pieces, a little stiff and not as soft as I&#x27;d like, works okay. They are too long to fit into my maybelline eye shadow compacts though :/</li>
    <li> Little sponges come off every chance they get. Good for applying eyeshadow, but you just have to be careful with them.</li>
    <li> Works great so far &amp; is small enough to fit in the eyeshadow containers I use.  Most applicators are too big, but these are not.</li>
