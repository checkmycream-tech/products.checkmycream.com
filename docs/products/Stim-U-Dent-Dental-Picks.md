      <li>/&gt;But the product is awesome.</li>

      <li>Best thing for gums and oral hygiene since sliced bread.  </li>
      <li>Very good portable toothpicks.  </li>

      <li>I like these stimudents because they fit in between my caps.</li>
      <li>These are shaped to fit.</li>
      <li>Indispensable.</li>
      <li>This is a great item we have gotten the regular stim-u-dents</li>
      <li>These picks are great for cleaning between teeth, especially if you cannot floss like</li>
      <li>the original ones won&#x27;t go between my teeth......</li>
      <li>Put one in your mouth first and let it get &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34; and it will become much more flexible (and durable).</li>
      <li>They have a lot more in the packet, but they are made of a different kind of wood.  </li>
      <li>Okay, my dentist really recommends the Stim-U-Dent Dental Picks.  </li>
      <li>They quickly get soaked and lose their rigidity; I use two at a brushing instead of the one medium thickness.  </li>
      <li>These are great for folks with tightly spaced teeth.  </li>
      <li>The picks are thinner than those I previously purchased, and break easily during use, requiring me to use easily 4 times as many picks at a time</li>
      <li>these thin dental picks are perfect for getting stuff out from between your teeth.  </li>
      <li>The thin Stimudents are perfect for me.....</li>
      <li>Far better than toothpicks.</li>
      <li>Works good for people with average spaced teeth.</li>
      <li>the normal Stim-U-Dent wouldn&#x27;t fit between most of them.&lt;br /&gt;Low &amp; behold they finally manufactured a thinner version, and</li>
      <li>The thin sticks are ideal.....</li>
      <li>These work much better than the thicker ones put out by the same company.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different toothpicks.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for that</li>
      <li>Now I won&#x27;t need to buy any for the next 5 years, most likely.&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
      <li>I love the thin ones, because they get in more places than the regular kind.</li>
      <li>I have small spaces between some of my teeth, and these help clean those areas and stimulate the gums, nicely.</li>
      <li>This product works much better than any of the dental floss I have used in the past- a true alternative to flossing!</li>
      <li>I find floss very hard to use since my teeth are really close at the top and the floss gets cut very easy and even pieces of it get stuck</li>
      <li>But watch out, follow the instructions, as being thinner they break much easier.</li>
      <li>Just be gentle with them.</li>
      <li>thanks for having them, as it is a must for me to use them.</li>
      <li>It really works.&lt;br /&gt;I can get the thinner ones between just about all of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
      <li>These work very well for getting food from between teeth.</li>
      <li>The thinness is really no advantage to between the teeth cleaning either; the medium ones did as well or better.</li>
      <li>The regular size is too big to get between my teeth effectively.  </li>
      <li>I did find a few in one package that broke really easy, but I think that is rare.</li>
      <li>have used the older thicker ones for about 50 years, yeah, 50, not a misprint.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the normal Stim-U-Dent for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>After my fourth checkup where she had to use the sonic thingy, my hygienist recommended that I find the regular version, which I had thought were no longer available.  </li>
      <li>This product is new for me, but upon using the thin stim-u-dent I am very satisfied</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>They are pretty sturdy as long as they are worked properly.</li>
      <li>They are more delicate than their standard thickness cousins and as such they tend to bend or fray</li>
      <li>floss.&lt;br /&gt;Being thinner you have to be careful since they break much</li>
      <li>The thin ones work better for me.</li>
      <li>They are OK but not great.</li>
      <li>They really do seem to help with combating plaque buildup and odd flakes of food.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased these local before, but can&#x27;t find them now.  So, of course I could here.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the older thicker ones for about 50 years, yeah, 50, not a misprint.  When I was younger my dentist recommended them to me. and I have used them off and on ever sense.  I now find the thinner ones much better.  But watch out, follow the instructions, as being thinner they break much easier.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do without them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. Indispensable.</li>
    <li> The thin ones work better for me. Unfortunately they&#x27;re not as widely available as the thicker ones. Glad I can get them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is new for me, but upon using the thin stim-u-dent I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> Perfect for after a meal.</li>
    <li> Works good for people with average spaced teeth.</li>
    <li> Thin design better than the wide design</li>
    <li> For some reason, the local brick and mortar stores carry the green ones. They are much larger than these. Lots of people tell me that I have a big mouth but it isn&#x27;t that big! These are perfect. Far better than toothpicks. These are shaped to fit. Just be gentle with them. Put one in your mouth first and let it get &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34; and it will become much more flexible (and durable). Then go to town.</li>
    <li> Stimudents have improved my dental hygiene noticeably.  My teeth are close together so the regular Stimudents (green package) are too thick, but it seems the only place I can get the thin ones is online.  All the retail stores I check only have the regular ones.</li>
    <li> Stim U Dents are great!</li>
    <li> I love these things. Works well with closely spaced teeth.</li>
    <li> I like these stimudents because they fit in between my caps.</li>
    <li> Excellent value and they are very hard to find at a retail store..</li>
    <li> so thin they break; first one got stuck between 2 teeth and broke off in there and stuck and took hours to get unstuck.  I regret my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product...I wish more stores would carry them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these all day long as my crutch after I quit smoking 7 years ago...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t leave home without them.</li>
    <li> Very good portable toothpicks.  Great for a ladies purse.  Somewhat too large to do a great tooth picking job but good and sanitary on the road.</li>
    <li> This product works much better than any of the dental floss I have used in the past- a true alternative to flossing!</li>
    <li> These work much better than the thicker ones put out by the same company.  I would recomend that you try them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get these at CVS or Walgreens anymore.  These are thinner than the regular ones an work great!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for keeping your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> We like these stim u dents.  They came on time and were what we wanted.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for that I couldn&#x27;t find in the stores. They are recommended by my dentist</li>
    <li> Just the thing for persons with tight spaces between teeth.  Very difficult to find in retail outlets.&lt;br /&gt;Very portable for dining out etc.</li>
    <li> They work great although this set of packages all had a funny taste, kinda like wood I guess.  I will still buy them though.</li>
    <li> I have been using the normal Stim-U-Dent for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth do not have a lot of space between &amp; the normal Stim-U-Dent wouldn&#x27;t fit between most of them.&lt;br /&gt;Low &amp; behold they finally manufactured a thinner version, and wow! It really works.&lt;br /&gt;I can get the thinner ones between just about all of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;No more food particles stuck that I miss with my dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;Being thinner you have to be careful since they break much easier.&lt;br /&gt;If you have teeth like mine you will really enjoy using the thin Stin-U-Dent.</li>
    <li> The picks are thinner than those I previously purchased, and break easily during use, requiring me to use easily 4 times as many picks at a time</li>
    <li> I found these in a local drug store, but I guess that not enough people bought them because they no longer stock them. They also come in a thicker size which is too thick for me. These work very well for getting food from between teeth. One reviewer said that they break too easy. I did find a few in one package that broke really easy, but I think that is rare. I can usually clean between most of my teeth with one. I find floss very hard to use since my teeth are really close at the top and the floss gets cut very easy and even pieces of it get stuck and it is hard to get out.</li>
    <li> these are fine, except flimsy; would be good to have some of the thicker ones on hand, too......</li>
    <li> Good price.  Hard to find the thin picks.</li>
    <li> They came out with this slimmer version which was great for me as my teeth are pretty close together. Cannot find them in stores here any more so really pleased to find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different toothpicks.  The Slim U Dent is perfect for my teeth.  They easily slide into places most toothpicks are too fat for.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering 2 of what was in the picture. They are multipacks with a set of toothpicks that are attached to each other. You pick one off at a time and use it. They are great! I keep them in my purse, my car, my drawer at work. Now I won&#x27;t need to buy any for the next 5 years, most likely.&lt;br /&gt;See what&#x27;s in the picture? I got 12 of those. I thought I was getting 2. Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product is awesome. I love the thin ones, because they get in more places than the regular kind. I&#x27;ve had mint flavor before. It&#x27;s ok, but if I had a choice (which I do), I&#x27;d go without. Just personal preference.</li>
    <li> Forty years ago I had gum surgery.  My dentist then told me that if I didn&#x27;t want to do it again, I should start using orange wood stimudents.  I used them religiously.  My gums never bled, there were no tea stains between my teeth, and I had really good checkups.  Then the stores I shop at replaced them with this thin version, which I used religiously for two years.  They have a lot more in the packet, but they are made of a different kind of wood.  They are quite brittle by comparison.  The thin ones poke the food from between my teeth like a toothpick, but they don&#x27;t scrub off the plaque and they often break, something that the orange wood stimudents seldom do.  After my fourth checkup where she had to use the sonic thingy, my hygienist recommended that I find the regular version, which I had thought were no longer available.  It made all the difference.  Six months later, no tea stains, no blood, no sonic thingy.  It&#x27;s  like they are an entirely different product.</li>
    <li> Love them . Thin to get between the spaces and helps gums too !</li>
    <li> The best toothpicks I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Okay, my dentist really recommends the Stim-U-Dent Dental Picks.  They really do seem to help with combating plaque buildup and odd flakes of food.  I use them and also floss, and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in my gums as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the thin ones are too thin.  They quickly get soaked and lose their rigidity; I use two at a brushing instead of the one medium thickness.  The thinness is really no advantage to between the teeth cleaning either; the medium ones did as well or better.</li>
    <li> This is a great item we have gotten the regular stim-u-dents and they were great but the thinner ones are even better</li>
    <li> Cheaper than a visit to the dentist, and more convenient than floss! Recommended by my hygenist.</li>
    <li> I got the Mint ones. They work well. I have small spaces between some of my teeth, and these help clean those areas and stimulate the gums, nicely. They are pretty sturdy as long as they are worked properly. No need to push them into the teeth; gently probing while removing plaque, works best. After years of being without Johnson &amp; Johnson Stim-u-Dents, I&#x27;m happy to find an able replacement. It&#x27;s bad news for my dentist, though, because I have healthier teeth when I have these little wood picks.</li>
    <li> Have used regular stimudents for years - love the thin ones!!</li>
    <li> Best thing for gums and oral hygiene since sliced bread.  Thin variety hard to find in stores.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> have used them for years. They work fine</li>
    <li> These are great for folks with tightly spaced teeth.  Floss does part of the job but these do stimulate the gums.  They are more delicate than their standard thickness cousins and as such they tend to bend or fray and you may need to use more than one to do the job.</li>
    <li> Good product and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> The thin Stimudents are perfect for me.....the original ones won&#x27;t go between my teeth......thanks for having them, as it is a must for me to use them.</li>
    <li> breaks easily during use.</li>
    <li> These were recommended to me by my dentist. They&#x27;re incredible!</li>
    <li> These picks are not &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; at all, they are no use to me unfortunately.</li>
    <li> these thin dental picks are perfect for getting stuff out from between your teeth.  i carry a pack everywhere i go and use one of them after every meal or snack.  get the thin ones - the other ones are much too thick to fit well between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Love these, so much better than toothpicks. Great before flossing and they help keep your gums healthier.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate to floss. These things are the answer, they work as good if not better than floss for me and are easier to use and accomplish the flossing task, which makes my dental hygenist very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular Stim-U-Dent picks; when I couldn&#x27;t find them online, I tried these. The tip of these breaks off sometimes. They are OK but not great.</li>
    <li> These picks are great for cleaning between teeth, especially if you cannot floss like I can&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these things, especially the thinner size here.  The regular size is too big to get between my teeth effectively.  I&#x27;m terrible about flossing, but I use these regularly and they are far superior to regular toothpicks.</li>
    <li> Started using sticks instead of floss from the time I lived in Europe. Using dental sticks is so much more effective and easier than floss. While using these I have never had problems with my gums. These sticks are not as good as the ones you get from Jordan in Europe, but they work fine.The thin sticks are ideal.....don&#x27;t know why these are impossible to find in a retail store.....the standard ones are too thick.</li>
