<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are the best scissors I have used on my Bf and myself (I trim my own bangs). Good price, fast shipping. I read the reviews regarding small finger holes, but my own fits perfectly and i feel I have regular sized female hands (never had a problem with gloves). However, it definitely does not fit my boyfriend&#x27;s fingers.</li>
    <li> Love them, be careful they will cut you.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good to use, and I have a small finger~</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly it was missing a cloth. They quickly responded and sending it out. I tried both scissors quickly on my yorkie they both worked well and quickly. I use to be a hair dresser so i have extremely expensive scissors for human hair only. But i have some cheaper ones too. So far id say they are definitely nice scissors especially for the price. Id recommend them. But dont expect them to be the same has the very expensive scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original set is for my yorkie. The price has dropped down by half i order another set for me. The shipped quickly. I had had no issues as of yet.</li>
    <li> WOW - GREAT PAIR OF SCISSORS - WELL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
    <li> These are great, everything I was expecting !</li>
    <li> The comb it comes with is garbage, I threw it away. The case in nice and professional looking. The thinning sheers work; they blend well. But, neither pair of sheers are sharp at all! They are not worth the price, at all.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these scissors. I looked up how to properly use the thinner and they work great as well as the shears.</li>
    <li> Sorry.  I used them only once so far, so my experience is limited.  I thinned okay.</li>
    <li> very sharp. I like it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product.  Finger holes are small but so are my fingers.  The plastic insert can be removed if you need bigger finger holes.  All in all, a very good product!</li>
    <li> so small a ant can&#x27;t use them</li>
    <li> A little big for my hands but over all for the price they were actually really good!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very great price&lt;br /&gt;Very nice quality scissors&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;You get the complete set of scissors for most common haircuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The case felt a little flimsy - but not a big deal&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to put the scissors back in their slots</li>
    <li> Very Happy with this product</li>
    <li> I use these to cut my sons hair. I am by no means a professional, but these work 10 times better than digging scissors out of the junk drawer! Very sharp and cut well.</li>
    <li> I actually like these shears but they are too heavy for me and arent as sharp as i expected but they get the job done</li>
    <li> I cut my husband and son&#x27;s hair regularly. They both have said these are the best scissors I have used on their hair. Great price too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied, works verry well!</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Rusts a little easy.</li>
    <li> It is very convenient when you do not have time to go to a hairdresser. A nice set you can take with you when you travel, nice case,</li>
    <li> Excellent scissors and thinners.  I have used both and are very professional and cut perfectly.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Fine for kids haircuts, but they are a bit clunky and not very sharp like I had expected. They can&#x27;t be used on thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great quality shears for a fair price.</li>
    <li> Received an item that was clearly used.  The case had crust on it.  The thinners had black hair specs in between the shears.  And they gave two thinners instead of one scissor and one thinner.  Comb was dirty.  Gross</li>
    <li> quick delivery! and perfect set!!</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck for shears!</li>
    <li> Solid.  Large fingers canfit in them</li>
    <li> Quality seems nice and the case is handy, but they aren&#x27;t sharp. Having to take them in to get sharpened is a nice excuse to get Baskin-Robbins though, so there&#x27;s give and take.</li>
    <li> Decent shears but have very tiny finger holes.I am a big  guy and can barely get my finger tips in the holes.They seem to be a little heavy also.&lt;br /&gt;They appear well made just not sure I can use them</li>
    <li> Kit contains essentials for hair trimming. Item delivered on time, Have not had item a sufficient length of time for complete evaluation.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy set for grooming hair. The shears and scissors work great and are a real bargain, especially with the compact leather case.</li>
    <li> loved cutting my new do with it.</li>
    <li> Bought these because I have curly hair and didnt  want to get my hair chopped funny at the salon. They are really nice. Heavy and sharp. Comes in a nice case with some cloths to clean with. The thinning shears seam good. I dont use them on curly hair but all in all happy. And my hair turned out good. :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy and surprised at the quality of these hair scissors and thinner scissors, they are very good quality and you can keep your scissors all zipped together in the handy zippered pouch. Nice!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scissors set - they work great for cutting hair and quick trims. Very sharp. I have had no difficulty with the size of the handle holes and I wear a size 7.5 - 8 ring on my middle finger.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> This pack scissors are a cheap oportunnity to become in a great professional hair cutting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! And you don&#x27;t have any regrets!</li>
    <li> Good quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> not sharp at all, they pull hair as you \\&quot;cut\\&quot; .. They are thick and heavy. I rather use the scissors that come with my kid&#x27;s  hair clippers they work way better. The finger holes are fine if you remove the blue plastic things. They didn&#x27;t hurt my fingers and are rather comfortable there. Too bad everything else stinks. (Oh and the comb is the cheapest plastic you could find, they arent the black colored ones you see on this photo. I got a yellow brush.) got 2 stars because the case is ok and the cloths cleaned my sunglasses nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my Yorkie.  The scissors are nice and sharp.  The finger holes are small but not too small for my hands.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> The finger holes are small, but you are not going to find a nicer pair of scissors for the price.</li>
    <li> Terrible! They didn&#x27;t cut the hair at all... I couldn&#x27;t even use them!</li>
    <li> The handle hole are too small for my hands ( I have average size hands so they are probably too small for you hands too)</li>
    <li> They cut hair and do it well.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this item I read the reviews on Amazon and the only negative ones were about the small size of the fingerholes in both the scissors and the thinning shears.  Since I have very small fingers I went ahead with the purchase and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This is a great set, very good quality, very sharp, and perfect for what I needed.  And for those people with larger fingers, there is a blue plastic insert in the fingerhole that is removeable.  When these are removed, the size of each fingerhole is a ring size 9.  With the insert, the size of each fingerhole is a ring size 6.5.</li>
    <li> Used the kit yesterday to cut my hair. It was excellent!! Well put together.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;m just trimming my sons ends after I use the clippers. Not flimsy. Works great! I love that it came in a case too!</li>
    <li> There are nice, but i received them scratched</li>
    <li> Meant for small figures</li>
    <li> They are cheap, cuts nicely and fits well. I&#x27;m going a haircut for my son and has no problems with the set.  Some people were complaining the it is difficult to put the fingers in, but I keep the schissors half way thought the fingers - I think that is what profeccionals do.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to invest in these instead of constantly spending money as the salon. Be warned- the holes for your fingers are very, very small. But it fits comfortable for me as I have a ring size of 6.  The thinning scissors did wonders for my hair.  I can say that I will save a lot of money with these in the long-run. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been trimming my own hair for years, but I don&#x27;t have any professional training, and I am satisfied with this hair cutting set. The main appeal to me is the fact that it comes with thinning shears as well as regular shears. I have very thick, fast-growing hair in a pixie cut, so frequent thinning and trimming is necessary, but I can&#x27;t afford to go to the salon every month. I used both pairs of shears on my hair tonight and found them to be adequately sharp, a good size and weight, and effective. The case they come in is nice, too. I am taking off one star because they do seem like they could be a little bit sharper, but for the price I&#x27;m still quite happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Nice weight and quality.</li>
    <li> Not a trained stylist or do it for a living. I cut my hair, husband&#x27;s, and kids at home. These work amazingly better than the Goodys hair cutting scissors. The tension is adjustable, and because of this yes they come loose over time. Just retighten. Love the finger guards. Only downfall is the finger hole size. It maybe just that Im using them wrong but my fingers get stuck. I have short and small fingers (size 6 1/2 ring middle finger). I can take the blue comfort rings out and it fits better but less comfortable. I&#x27;m not sure how professional sissors feel. Love the case too. There is room for my razor to fit in there. If you want to save money buy cutting hair at home and you need a decent set, this is it.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. The set was made for someone with very small finger. I can&#x27;t use the product because of the size of the scissor!</li>
    <li> I have shih tzus with thick silky hair which makes it hard for most scissors to cut it. These did great. They were comfortable and super sharp.</li>
    <li> These are great for cutting hair, but there is one problem the holes in the handle are quite small. Good thing my girlfriends hands are small so they are perfect for our needs.</li>
    <li> I cut hair all the time, this is great.</li>
    <li> Good price, nice kit .love it</li>
    <li> These scissors are well made and cut my hair very nicely. I was hesitant to get them because the main complaint in the reviews was the finger holes were deemed too small. They were fine for me but I have very tiny fingers. With what I spent, I consider it a very good deal.</li>
    <li> Holes were too small to even just use fingertips. To top it off they were full. The case itself is wonderful. Bought new scissors at a beauty supply store &amp; kept this order just for the case.</li>
    <li> Amazing shears for a really great price, the thinning/texturing ones are great for choppy layers like my hair and the regular ones for precise edges. Nice teasing and parting comb too! (Oh and irrelevant piece of info unless you&#x27;re dead set on the color blue, I got an orange comb with mine.)</li>
    <li> Good, but there are small holes for fingers</li>
    <li> Great set responsible price, the scissors cut good and  thinning shears are perfect.</li>
    <li> As of now, it was very sharp when I first used it.</li>
    <li> Great product I love it</li>
    <li> Dull,  very dull shears.  Not worth my money.</li>
    <li> Very Bad items and used</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, and nice case.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Both scissors have cut well and performed as expected. The size of the finger holds were not a problem for me. The scissors also come with the removable blue inserts, which I think would solve a lot of people&#x27;s gripe about the small finger holds. For reference, you can almost pass a quarter through the finger holes with the inserts removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern was that someone had used my scissors before. The pair of scissors I received was definitely not new; it is slightly worn from use  (scuffed, etc.) and may have been a refurbished pair of scissors. Disappointing but as someone who cares more about functionality, I only docked one star as the scissors were still in good working order and maintained a relatively sharp edge.</li>
    <li> Will get the job done but is lacking any quality. Blue plastic inserts are junk and fall out.  Blue rubber bump stop disintegrates with the first hair cut. ..but they do  provide you with two replacements.  It looks like the tensioner knob is anodized but it&#x27;s not, just painted with blue paint that is already chipped half off when received.  Not very sharp, had trouble cuting wet hair on a 5yr old.  Case won&#x27;t last long,  poorly sewn. Spend more and find a better one.  This is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a wig-trimming set so as not to dull my expensive hair cutting scissors. Delivery was on-time as promised with Prime, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the nice quality of scissors, plus the case is decently made with no issues. All these items sold separately add up to much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are sharp, comfy, and comfortable in my hand. They cut nicely on synthetic wig hair, and feel durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and feel I got a GREAT value for under $20.</li>
