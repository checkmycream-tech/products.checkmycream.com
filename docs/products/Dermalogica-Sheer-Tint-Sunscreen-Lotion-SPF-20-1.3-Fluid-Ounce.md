<ol>
      <li>Perfect for me, protects my skin and evens the tone a bit.</li>
      <li>but now I mix it and it is perfect!</li>
      <li>The product has a lot of moisture to it which is what I like best.</li>
      <li>Dermalogica is the best....</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>Looked great indoors.  </li>
      <li>As my face seems to sweat a lot in the summer, I thought this would be great instead of makeup.  </li>
      <li>The tint is also great</li>
      <li>All my products are from Dermalogica and this is one of my favorite ones!!</li>
      <li>so I can feel comfortable knowing that I&#x27;m giving my skin the best!</li>
      <li>but Dermalogica is good quality.</li>
      <li>and I have fair skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer, smells great, and looks so smooth on your skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>I love this brand!</li>
      <li>and it gives me a nice glow and a healthy color without having to worry about make up!</li>
      <li>It is a nice moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Specially good in summer as it easily blends into one&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>Good coverage, light weight</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of coverage and great colour.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer, with good coverage, great SPF protection everyday</li>
      <li>It also has a fair amount of coverage - it isn&#x27;t full coverage by any means</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 9-12 different drugstore brands and there are some good ones, but not as great as this one.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, light, tinted moisturizer that works well.</li>
      <li>Overall color, protection, and texture works for me best out of any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Coverage is okay.  </li>
      <li>If you want to have coverage without going through your entire makeup regiment, this product is perfect.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it has SPF.</li>
      <li>It is light, goes on smoothly and evens color nicely.</li>
      <li>I loved the old product.</li>
      <li>I very much fell in love with it at that point.</li>
      <li>What I&#x27;m saying is, the cost is worth the results.</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m a heavy believer that the drugstore has super products that are up to par with more luxurious brands, the Dermalogica tinted moisturizer isn&#x27;t one I&#x27;ve been able to duplicate.</li>
      <li>I often try other products sometimes with great success but return to this for its natural looking but adequate coverage.  </li>
      <li>I first started using this lotion about 3 years ago, where the salon I worked at sold it to employees at a 50% markdown.</li>
      <li>Brings light and evens out my complexion, while leaving me looking natural.  </li>
      <li>It protects from the sun… When I first bought it they told me to mix with my moisturiser…</li>
      <li>Since then - until a few months ago when I repurchased this one - I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a good drugstore dupe.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I ran out of it about a year ago and since I didn&#x27;t work at the salon anymore, didn&#x27;t wanna pay so much for moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping got what I wanted</li>
      <li>What I like the most about this is that it isn&#x27;t cakey at all - you&#x27;d be surprised at how some &#x27;hydrating&#x27; tinted moisturizers might cake up on skin which totally defeats the purpose of a tinted MOISTURIZER.</li>
      <li>It goes on a little shiny at first, but absorbs to a nice natural looking finish that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Sheer but definitely a great sunscreen - I use this product everyday!</li>
      <li>One note: I was surprised that medium was the correct color (chosen by a knowledgable consultant) for me even though I am fair and usually use the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade of any product.</li>
      <li>Dermalogica sheer tint is an outstanding light moisturizer with just enough tint to resemble make up without the heavy feel with the sunscreen rolled in!</li>
      <li>But apparently it blocks my pores, because as soon as I got outside in the heat, it ran right off my face.  </li>
      <li>My go-to for natural looking skin protection.</li>
      <li>As I am very into skincare, I am blessed with decent enough skin that I can get away with tinted moisturizer daily.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t tend to wear heavy makeup, and this is just right for me.</li>
      <li>If you have more serious blemishes or dark spots, you may find concealer paired with this would be helpful.</li>

    <li> Great moisturizer, smells great, and looks so smooth on your skin</li>
    <li> Good coverage, light weight and I love that it has SPF.</li>
    <li> I am alergic to everything so this is a godsend… I cannot use Titanium Dioxide products so have to seek out Zinc Oxide and I filly found this one. It protects from the sun… When I first bought it they told me to mix with my moisturiser… but I did not… so it got a little drying… but now I mix it and it is perfect!</li>
    <li> If you want to have coverage without going through your entire makeup regiment, this product is perfect.  Cleanse your face as usual, put the Sheer Tint Moisture on, add a little mascara and lip gloss - you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it never disappoints.  Dermalogica is the best....my skin has made a dramatic change since I starting using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and always get compliments on my complexion!  It is a nice moisturizer. I hate to see people looking like they have a mask on or makeup lines!  Definitely not an issue with this product!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light, tinted moisturizer that works well. Brings light and evens out my complexion, while leaving me looking natural.  I don&#x27;t tend to wear heavy makeup, and this is just right for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is weightless and works well. The color blends in well and I have fair skin. It gives just a little color. Not chalky.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Doesn&#x27;t make your face feel like you&#x27;re wearing thick sunscreen.  The tint is also great and I don&#x27;t wear foundation when I use this.</li>
    <li> I love this brand! All my products are from Dermalogica and this is one of my favorite ones!! Great moisturizer, with good coverage, great SPF protection everyday and it gives me a nice glow and a healthy color without having to worry about make up! It is a must for me everyday! No chimicals, alcohol or fragrances so I can feel comfortable knowing that I&#x27;m giving my skin the best!</li>
    <li> Sheer but definitely a great sunscreen - I use this product everyday!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping got what I wanted Thanks</li>
    <li> My go-to for natural looking skin protection.</li>
    <li> I am using this product along with Dermalogica ultracalming serum, barrier repair, and ultracalming cleanser. Together, these have been the answer to my roseacea problems. I use this tinted moisturizer as foundation and sunscreen. It goes on a little shiny at first, but absorbs to a nice natural looking finish that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this tinted moisturizer. Perfect for me, protects my skin and evens the tone a bit. Price point may be a little high but Dermalogica is good quality. I do wonder if they changed the formula though it feels slightly thicker than last I used it which was maybe a year ago.  Overall color, protection, and texture works for me best out of any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  I often try other products sometimes with great success but return to this for its natural looking but adequate coverage.  Specially good in summer as it easily blends into one&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> As my face seems to sweat a lot in the summer, I thought this would be great instead of makeup.  Looked great indoors.  But apparently it blocks my pores, because as soon as I got outside in the heat, it ran right off my face.  Very expensive lesson in what not to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased. I had been looking for something like this for several years since my previous product went out of production.  It is light, goes on smoothly and evens color nicely. One note: I was surprised that medium was the correct color (chosen by a knowledgable consultant) for me even though I am fair and usually use the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade of any product.</li>
    <li> First time trying this product, hopefully it will work like the past Foundation that Dermalogica took away... I loved the old product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a number of years and it never lets me down.  Just the right amount of coverage and great colour.</li>
    <li> As I am very into skincare, I am blessed with decent enough skin that I can get away with tinted moisturizer daily. It gives enough coverage to even out skin tone, especially this product. I first started using this lotion about 3 years ago, where the salon I worked at sold it to employees at a 50% markdown. I very much fell in love with it at that point. I ran out of it about a year ago and since I didn&#x27;t work at the salon anymore, didn&#x27;t wanna pay so much for moisturizer. Since then - until a few months ago when I repurchased this one - I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a good drugstore dupe.

I&#x27;ve tried about 9-12 different drugstore brands and there are some good ones, but not as great as this one.

It also has a fair amount of coverage - it isn&#x27;t full coverage by any means but it does polish up minor imperfections and redness. If you have more serious blemishes or dark spots, you may find concealer paired with this would be helpful. Another bonus is that it has SPF 20 - most brands have SPF 15.I also find the mica in here imparts a &#x27;glow&#x27; that isn&#x27;t shimmery or glittery which some drugstore brands were guilty of. At the end of the day, it says a lot that I ended up repurchasing this product at a higher price point when I failed to find something comparable at a lower price. What I&#x27;m saying is, the cost is worth the results.</li>
