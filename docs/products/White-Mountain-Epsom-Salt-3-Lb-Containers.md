<li> this end up in my vacuum.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been putting a little epsom salts in my kids bath and it makes their skin so soft.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really good on my skin but a little too expensive for the small amount if you plan on using this for saltwater baths.</li>
<li> These will last a while, but not for ever -  Using 3 cups per detox bath every other week, it makes a soothing, relaxing 20 minutes of enjoyment.  </li>
<li> I suspect the other brand has an anti caking agent and it seemed I needed less of the white mountain salts to get an expected effect/feel after a bath.</li>
<li> Packing was not proper for this product and it was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong if you are soaking in this right here.</li>
<li> All Epsom salts are magnesium sulfate, I&#x27;m not sure why one would be different from another.  .</li>
<li> I ordered something else in bulk when it was on sale, But that other brand ended up in the garden</li>
<li> item arrived in shrink wrap covering two cartons, when I removed the shrink wrap, the cartons were apparently slightly damaged on the bottom when the shrink wrap came off all the epson salt fell on the floor.</li>
<li> 3 lbs instead of the usual 2 lb from other places.</li>
<li> product seemed stale, crusty and lumpy in the box, but once dissolved in water was as soothing as other epsom products.</li>
<li> Less expensive at Wallyworld (Walmart)</li>
<li> needed this really bad and couldn&#x27;t get to the store, life saver</li>

    <li> Love my baths with this!</li>
    <li> Great in the bath and as a scrub mixed with almond oil, also works well as a fertilizer in the garden!</li>
    <li> Way overpriced. Walmart has 8lb bags for like 7$.</li>
    <li> I use this in my garden. You offer a great price for the qty.</li>
    <li> They worked fine for golf tournament for my husbands work. They held up in the rain. They were out all day</li>
    <li> product seemed stale, crusty and lumpy in the box, but once dissolved in water was as soothing as other epsom products.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, great value</li>
    <li> I ave been using this Epsom Salt for quite some time now and I like it very much. I use it for myself, my 2 young daughters and my husband uses it as well. It has so many uses and really does the trick in so many circumstances. I have used this brand in this packaging several times and have been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> needed this really bad and couldn&#x27;t get to the store, life saver</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very useful for soaking minor wounds to help discourage infection. A staple in our household.</li>
    <li> I ordered something else in bulk when it was on sale, But that other brand ended up in the garden and I went back to this for personal use ... All Epsom salts are magnesium sulfate, I&#x27;m not sure why one would be different from another.  . However this is a brand I trust and have used for years.  I suspect the other brand has an anti caking agent and it seemed I needed less of the white mountain salts to get an expected effect/feel after a bath.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I could not just drink this with water. I had to mix it with juice. Just didn&#x27;t sit well with me - caused bloating and gas. Worked great for baths though!</li>
    <li> this is my go-to epsom salt.  It&#x27;s the best!  I use it for baths almost daily.  You should buy this one!</li>
    <li> Not bad came in no open no wit marks, around the 2 boxes is plastic so it stays nice. Have not tried it in the drink yet, tho works good th I do not think I put enough in, just feeling the words so it will let me submit</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time and as described.</li>
    <li> It is what it is. It was delivered promptly and in one piece. It&#x27;s epsom salt. I haven&#x27;t used it all, yet, but will use it for the tub as well as homemade fabric softener.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to buy and have it sent tot the house than to have to lug it home from the store and it&#x27;s a better buy too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied with my purchase of the 2-pack of Epsom Salt. It&#x27;s exactly as described and will do wonderful things for my garden.</li>
    <li> effective in garden as magniesium boost and in bath to reduce sore muscles and in concoction to kill weeds in garden</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Appreciate how Amazon says they will deliver and always on time. This product was great because I didn&#x27;t have to haul it from store to door. Just opened front door and voila. Ready to add some lavender oil that I ordered and dry skin soaked up the luxery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been putting a little epsom salts in my kids bath and it makes their skin so soft.  I let them play in the tub as long as they want because there&#x27;s such good health benefits of soaking in epsom salts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve appreciated having this salt on hand. The quantity is enough to last, without trying to figure out storage issues. I use it frequently for soaks, as well as for making bath fizzies. No complaints.</li>
    <li> serves our purpose well.</li>
    <li> nice to soak in hot bathtub with epsom salts.....great relief for sore muscles.....</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
    <li> Magnesium chloride is a pretty genetic chemical, so price is the whole issue as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I bought this because it was the cheapest online at the time, and it works just fine in the jacuzzi tub.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go without! Less expensive at Wallyworld (Walmart) but I dislike that store. Plus this way it&#x27;s always here. 3 lbs instead of the usual 2 lb from other places. I use it for soaking and in my garden..</li>
    <li> Perfect product to soak up in the tub and relax in warm water, and let the minerals get in to your body through the skin. I recommend this product to all that have problems with joints, overworked body, muscle pains. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Have used this Epsom Salt on my tomatoes this year to great results.  Also works well on peppers, perked up and put out a huge harvest!</li>
    <li> Buying in bulk you can get it for $1-$1.50 per pound.</li>
    <li> Great product but overpriced</li>
    <li> They came right on time and were perfect for what I needed them for.</li>
    <li> These will last a while, but not for ever -  Using 3 cups per detox bath every other week, it makes a soothing, relaxing 20 minutes of enjoyment.  Very satisfied with the product and will be buying more in the not too distant future.</li>
    <li> item arrived in shrink wrap covering two cartons, when I removed the shrink wrap, the cartons were apparently slightly damaged on the bottom when the shrink wrap came off all the epson salt fell on the floor. Packing was not proper for this product and it was a waste of my money. I love Epsom salt! Its a real shame this end up in my vacuum.</li>
    <li> Not the products fault at all.  It worked great did wonderful for its purpose as a soothing bath.  But 3 lbs isn&#x27;t as much as one would think</li>
    <li> My gram used epsom salt, dad, now me. You can&#x27;t go wrong if you are soaking in this right here.</li>
    <li> I was told that these would be good for stress management so I bought them.  I can not confirm that they have relieved my stress but boy there is a LOT of salt here.  I&#x27;ll try more baths and see if I can shake the stress...</li>
    <li> Bought this for use in my garden --  add it to supplement organic fertilizer and really get good green, strong plants from it.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery.  Great in bath.</li>
    <li> I have been using epsom salt with a quarter cup of oatmeal body wash for my baths which includes washing my hair scalp and it is very relaxing.  Do not use too much epsom salt more than what the direction says or it will be too strong and you may feel dizzy.</li>
    <li> I still have a big supply and can&#x27;t say just yet but the product I trust</li>
    <li> Again, this is Epsom salt!  what else can i say!!!</li>
    <li> the epsom salts arrived on time and perfectly packaged.  the cartons were intact!  these are available locally, but since i do not drive i was glad to be able to get them in the mail....</li>
    <li> Very happy on a great services on both ends keep up the good work thank you</li>
