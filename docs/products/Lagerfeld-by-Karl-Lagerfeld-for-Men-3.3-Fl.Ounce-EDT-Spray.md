<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> SEXY......SEXY........SEX........Y</li>
    <li> Been using for years.  It still is a wonderful scent that lasts several hours.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a liter scents that are great, some of the citrus scents like Hermes Orange, TABAC and even Obsession are best of category.&lt;br /&gt;Wonder why there are no talcs available.&lt;br /&gt;A good talc for men are as, maybe more important than cologne. Lagerfeld , Obsession and other just disappeared in the last several years.</li>
    <li> I have used Lagerfield for years.  I am frequently asked what cologne I am using.  (I think that is a good thing.)  It hasn&#x27;t been easy to find locally, so I ordered from Amazon.  I thought it was a bit expensive but when I received it, the bottle was larger than I remembered, so I was satisfied with the price.  Delivery was on time.  All-in-all, a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Lagerfeld for years. I still get compliments on the scent!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance has become hard to find but it still gets compliments from the ladies.  Will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> I was asked to tell you why I like the product. Well, number one, it smells just like Lagerfeld. Need I say more. OK one more thing, women like it.</li>
    <li> OLD STANDARD this scent continues to impress me even though I have been using for over 3 decades, I have purchased many in the past and will continue to do so in the future</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cologne.  My favorite for my husband to wear.</li>
    <li> Smells great. My son loves this because his father wore it.</li>
    <li> Distinctive classic scent so people will ask you what you are wearing rather than tell you what you have on.</li>
    <li> I got this cologne after reading reviews....most of them were saying that it&#x27;s awesome...and very few saying it&#x27;s awful.  I wish I believed the latest.  I absolutely hate the fragrance.  May be the one I god is fake? Then Amazon have to do something with this!</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase.  Thankful, can&#x27;t find at local stores.  Very happy husband</li>
    <li> My wife biought some of this for me years ago and really likes it, if she likes I need it, if you get what I&#x27;m saying. Could not find it anywhere and then here it was. This old cowboy is back in the saddle again.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem like the buy at Maceys</li>
    <li> Smells good! People love the smell and ask me what is is and where I got it! Some of the people I know now use this product</li>
    <li> This cologne has been around for years. I purchased it for my brother and he loves it. Packaging came in perfect condition and he said the scent was still as great as ever!!!</li>
    <li> is of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;m very pleased with the perfume. i don´t know that i will buy this another time</li>
    <li> Great scent. Goes a long way, lasts all day. Great value for the money. I recommend this to anyone. Men that is!</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband and found better pricing on line. If you want to save some money and the box is not important to you, then sometimes this is available without the box for less.</li>
    <li> Excellent, everything in order, 100 % Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is my smell. I love it and have been wearing it since 87&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this fragrance for years for my husband.  He has been wearing this cologne many years - prior to my meeting him.</li>
    <li> I have worn Lagerfeld since I was a teenager. That is several decades. The only smellems I wear. There is no other product I have been dedicated to using for this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about ordering from Amazon because too many reviewers complained about getting bogus, knockoff colognes. I decided to risk it because I hate shopping at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is a Prime product, it took a week or so to arrive. However, it clearly states it will take longer for the package to ship. No complaint, just FYI. It ships UPS, not USPS, so fewer worries about mailbox heat leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne arrived in the same box with cellophane wrapping just like I get at the department store. The bottle intact, sprayer working properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first test spray I knew it was the real deal. That wonderful Lagerfeld smell.</li>
    <li> Love this! I buy this for my boyfriend just about every Christmas. It smells so good on him.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I both like the smell of this..</li>
    <li> What can you say? If you know Lagerfeld, its just that. I love the fruitiness of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know Lagerfeld, it is brilliant. I have never had a woman not enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it is the Chick-Magnet of guys cologne.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne since the mid 80&#x27;s and to this day I still get compliments from young and old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 30years. Every time we go out the women say I smell delicious. Ill never change.</li>
    <li> This review is for:&lt;br /&gt;Lagerfeld Classic Eau de Toilette Natural...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new fragrance, this might be the one for you.  It is quite manly and smells terrific.  I purchased it for my step-dad, who loves the stuff.  We want him to smell good, so we got this for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This classic fragrance has been around for several years.  My step-dad has been wearing it ever since I can remember.  Here is a big bottle of Eau de Toilette in spray format.  It&#x27;s easy to put it on, as little or as much as you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classic fragrance. Spray bottle.  Decent price.  This is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I purchased this product at full price for a Father&#x27;s Day present coming up.</li>
    <li> My fall and winter go-to cologne for work and play!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the colognes that when a man wears you kind of follow him around just to keep smelling the scent.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My husband wears the most awful cologne because a relative gave it to him, but when I buy him this cologne, he just wears this and I love it!</li>
    <li> Brought this for my husband. When we first met 23 yr ago he was wearing lagerfeld,and I came across it and surprise him wih it. He was so happy!!!</li>
    <li> I really thought this gift was going to arrive after my husband&#x27;s birthday....I AM SURPRISED AS HE WILL BE!  It arrived before his birthday without having to pay extra for faster shipping.  This is one of two cologne gifts. SPEEDY!  One happy customer!</li>
    <li> The real deal! Not a knock-off. This is the large one so you get a good deal. Smells perfect. A classic!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a Christmas/Birthday gift to a friend. He loves it (as I knew he would) It&#x27;s my favorite men&#x27;s cologne!</li>
    <li> I bought this because everyone always asks what it is I&#x27;m wearing. LOVE this cologne, even though it&#x27;s a throwback. Nothing else quite like it, and it lasts a long time, throughout the day. I&#x27;m almost due for another order, and it&#x27;s only been about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> awesome this is my husbands favorite and i have bought it before. i would also buy again and again. great</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have enjoyed for years.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> Been useing it for years that&#x27;s all I use now and that&#x27;s everyday</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne my dad will wear and I wanted to get him a bottle for Christmas. I could not find this stuff anywhere and believe me I looked everywhere! I finally resorted to just purchasing it off of amazon, and I was actually really happy with the price. It smells great and he loved it.</li>
    <li> Great Price for the size.....My honey loves it; I will be ordering it every two months....</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly !  Arrived in great shape and sooner than expected . Thank You !!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne and I used it for 30 years. It smells great and its fragrance is not overpowering when compared to other men&#x27;s colognes on the market today. It is a little more expensive than some other brands but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually get a gift set like this where you get the Eau De Toilette Spray and the aftershave in the same kit. It makes it a better buy when you buy the kit and the larger size. It&#x27;s a masculine fragrance that smells great, try it, you will like it.</li>
    <li> My top was broke on the bottle and it wasn&#x27;t all the way full but smell is great thanks ok</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lagerfeld for a long time after an old girlfriend bought it for me (decades, now that I think about it). I continue to use it and often get positive comments from passing strangers on it. It&#x27;s not the newest or trendiest cologne, just a pleasant masculine scent that does not overpower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other colognes but have not found one I (or my wife) likes as much. I believe it may have changed slightly in recent years but could be wrong about that. Regardless, I&#x27;ll continue using it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an exquisite, classic and at the same time modern fragrance. It is not disgusting and is durable. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cologne is &#x27;magic&#x27; for me. It&#x27;s something an old girlfriend recommended many years ago and I haven&#x27;t purchased it for many years, until now. Just the scent brings back some pleasant memories. This woman told me &amp;#34;That&#x27;s how a man should smell&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve been approached by women in grocery stores and a theater who actually echoed her words, and asked what I was wearing. I&#x27;m much older now, so it doesn&#x27;t happen as often, but it suits me!</li>
    <li> I like the smell and could not find it any place else. Karl Lagerfeld smell great everyone says it smell good on me</li>
    <li> I have not worn Lagerfeld for over 25 years and was very pleased to have found it on Amazon.  It brings back a lot of great memories.</li>
    <li> My father in law loved it!</li>
    <li> Not strong enough does not last more. Than an hour.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this and this was a good price for 4.2oz</li>
    <li> This is a classic manly scent. It was introduced in the eighties. Somewhat hard to find, but well worth it. I would recommend it to all men 40 and older.......................</li>
    <li> The best cologne ever....</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite frangrance for many years. Not always easy to find but here it was, and at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite, lasts and doesn&#x27;t over power.  I can&#x27;t tell you the number of times I&#x27;ve gotten a good comment.</li>
    <li> One of my first colony Exclusive and fragrance Excellent ..! for everyday wear. I like to use it every day&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it 100% you will not regret ...</li>
    <li> My dad liked this frgangrance as a gift for Christmas and I&#x27;m glad that I was able to locate it.</li>
    <li> My husband used to wear this cologne all the time when I met him.  Now I have found such a great deal I will be coming back on a regular basis to keep those memories growing!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite and his signature &amp;#34;smell.&amp;#34; It began getting difficult to find a few years ago, but it is worth the look. Rich, a little spicy, warm...</li>
    <li> I wear Lagerfeld, and get many compliments on the scent. Considering not only the scent seems to last an entire work day, a bottle lasts over a year. It is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> my husband has been wearing Lagerfeld for over 25 years, loved it then and still love it now, the end</li>
    <li> Great scent.  My man wears this and I love the fragrance.  For a while I couldn&#x27;t find it but it recently came back on the market.  It does not have that allergy-inducing undertone that Polo &amp; Calvin Klein have.</li>
    <li> Love the product but arrived with smashed lid.  Not very attractive sitting out without it.</li>
    <li> Thank you. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This cologne come out on the earliest part of the 80&#x27;s and at one time was number one for a while. But for me still the best out there.</li>
    <li> Well, it has been many years since I dated Suzi, but she thought it was the best.  That was more than 30 years ago.  I ran across it again recently and bought it just for the heck of it.  It really is a good, classic fragrance:  nothing but complements.</li>
    <li> This was my husband&#x27;s signature scent years ago. The current one doesn&#x27;t have half of the oomph that the vintage collection did. Disappointing.........no staying power, no silage.........a cheaper version for sure.</li>
    <li> My lady love it so I won&#x27;t change&lt;br /&gt;It lasts long and is fresh not sweet or overpowering  when my lady says it&#x27;s the best then it&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> Love that Amazon have this! My husband favorite perfume and not found in big stores! Love, love  the smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad this favorite is still around. Ran out of it and was afraid it may not be available.</li>
    <li> Not the same as the original in scent or brightness.  And it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the original.</li>
    <li> My oldest brother wore Lagerfeld when he was a college student in the early 1980&#x27;s. I was a pre-teen, but I have never forgotten that scent and all the ladies &amp;#34;associated&amp;#34; with my brother. It is such a masculine scent and my wife loves when I wear it. I bought 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s five stars because I smell great! Lagerfeld is one of the best colognes! Great price for the product. Hard to find at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> Thought I would never find this product again--I&#x27;ve ordered twice so far and have been very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> This is a classic.  Smells great - and lasts long enough. This size was a great deal. We both love this scent so I think it&#x27;s a win-win :)</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I have ever worn.  The smell is great.  Not too harsh.  It lasts for hours.  I get compliments from people all the time.  I probably shouldn&#x27;t be writing such a good review.  It might just cause a mad rush and demand for it.  I would hate to think I was responsible for making my favorite cologne so popular that it would be very hard to get in the future.  I hope not.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lagerfeld for long time and to it still rates up there with the best. Try 360 Red.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m guessing this is a knock off.  It has a chemically smell to it that is not what i am used to.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Lagerfeld.  It has a lasting pleasant fragrance to it and it is no overpowering.  Also, love the price through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years but local department stores have discontinued it for more trendy scents.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant but not over powering.</li>
    <li> exelente 100% original</li>
    <li> GREAT FRAGANCE AND LONG LASTING!!!</li>
    <li> Love this smell on my husband!!!  Need I say more?  Recommend this to every woman that loves her man!</li>
    <li> Came on time. I never knew about the cologne but my husband loved it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  I ordered Lagerfeld After Shave and I received Cologne.  I f you take notice of the ad, the after shave does not  have a spray tube in the bottle.  However, the cost to return &amp; the hassle isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This was the spray and not the splash.  All descriptions noted if it was spray, this one did not.  I could not return it.  So, I have 2 unopened bottles of this stuff I cannot use.</li>
    <li> was a gift for my dad its his favorite scent but it wasnt the original like i expected but a good buy and loved it anyways thanks</li>
    <li> Unfortunately with all the counterfeit goods and Amazon’s no return policy on colognes I learned a 24.00 lesson. I will go To Macy’s and spend more for the real item. At least they could have made it smell close to the original. Just smells like a bunch of chemicals in a bottle. I would not purchase this product here.</li>
    <li> This is the cologne and only cologne that my hubby uses. I purchased it as a stocking stuffer for Christmas because I noticed he was running low on his current bottle. Product arrived way before Christmas and I received the Seal of Approval from my hubby... Gotta love it!!!</li>
    <li> The colonge was good buit the ring on top came broken in many pieces. Would purchace again as the price was right</li>
    <li> This is retro and I bought it as such.  It all depends on what type of (age group ) you are wearing this around.  Mixed real person reviews.</li>
    <li> Surprise! This includes body wash too!</li>
    <li> Still my go-to summer fragrance.</li>
    <li> for some reason I think that the smell is not as pleasant as just to be,so next time I will get the Lagerfeld Cologne, the question is . Is the Cologne stronger....?</li>
    <li> This was a spray, but that was not revealed in the description.  I am now stuck with something I do not want since it is deemed not able to be returned..</li>
    <li> Was just what he wanted</li>
