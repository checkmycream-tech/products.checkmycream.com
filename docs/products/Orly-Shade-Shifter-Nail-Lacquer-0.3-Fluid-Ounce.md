      <li>It is great.</li>

      <li>I was worried about that, but it turned out great.</li>
      <li>I really loved this soak off gel nail polish.  </li>
      <li>in all, this is an amazing gel, and has become very popular with my clients.</li>
      <li>the bottle that I received was a great consistency and applied very easily.  </li>
      <li>This shade shifter gel fx is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>I really do love it!</li>
      <li>The formula was really nice</li>
      <li>When my hands are really warm</li>
      <li>I have been doing my own nails with gel for a couple of years now.</li>
      <li>And when your hands are warm it reveals the manicure underneath it.</li>
      <li>It removes easily which is another plus!</li>
      <li>I would say I am 99% happy with this - the effect is pretty neat.</li>
      <li>but most of  all I love how my nails change color throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I love this polish.</li>
      <li>More than two coats is a better idea.</li>
      <li>my ombre nails are fantastic!</li>
      <li>It cured just fine with my finger paints brand light!</li>
      <li>This polish is soooo cool!</li>
      <li>for the application of the gel itself, it went on smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;shade shift\\&quot; unless its a huge temperature difference.</li>
      <li>It does take 3 coats to cover light colors though.</li>
      <li>yes they put me under the UV light.  </li>
      <li>takes 30 seconds under my LED light..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a GEL polish, meaning you need a UV light to cure it, then apply a topcoat, cure that, and wipe with alcohol.</li>
      <li>YOU MUST CURE IT UNDER LED OR A UV LIGHT...</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
      <li>Firstly, I did not purchase this gel on Amazon, because there were better prices on eBay (around $10).  </li>
      <li>FUN!  </li>
      <li>No issues at all with placement, and I only needed to use one coat (I do my own nails at home using the gelish system mostly).  </li>
      <li>Once you can&#x27;t see it you won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s where it shouldn&#x27;t be until after, and you can&#x27;t clean it up</li>
      <li>It goes on easy, can be applied on any color, and is so fun</li>
      <li>I bought this and was super excited, so excited that I bought 2 of them.  </li>
      <li>I was super excited to recieve this ítem since I have another brand of mood changing polish (Gel II)</li>
      <li>I used it over a sparkly red polish from Gelish and loved the results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and its pretty easy.</li>
      <li>But really fun and gives you a cool ombre/french some of the time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much fun to put over any color.</li>
      <li>Though, it was surprisingly thinner than I expected.</li>
      <li>Be patient, and its worth it.</li>
      <li>When my hands were warm the nails were sparkly red,</li>
      <li>It ran into my cuticles and turned clear so I couldn&#x27;t properly clean it up before curing it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It gave a very squishy look to my nails along with the cool shifting effect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used orly gel before, I&#x27;m using it on top of Essie nail polish (even though it says to only use it on orly gel fx)</li>
      <li>It dries dull and requires a top coat on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i did not have to use several coats for it to work, one seem to be just fine.</li>
      <li>Seriously, I can&#x27;t stop messing with making it change, washing hands in cool water, then warm water, letting them sit over the AC in the car, it makes me amused just looking at</li>
      <li>Works well, but very runny.</li>
      <li>but the change is really neat.</li>
      <li>takes several coats and it does affect the under color if it  is really light</li>
      <li>It is also very streaky, even after 2 coats.  </li>
      <li>effect of the color change is very neat..</li>
      <li>It is very watery.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really experience this.  </li>
      <li>clear right as you begin applying it, so be prepared with using the less is more theory.</li>
      <li>It is very thin, so you might need to clean up the edges, and cuticles, but if you do that before you cure it, it&#x27;s super easy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After wearing this for a few days I have fallen in love with it.</li>
      <li>I wish It came in other colors other than just black, but the effect is awesome.</li>
      <li>Other wise, its just a crappy shade of black.</li>
      <li>My nail color actually looked maroon with the black over the bright red.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for my girlfriend because she got really excited about the idea of color changing nail polish and layering it with other colors.</li>
      <li>Well, it wasn&#x27;t stated that this is a GEL polish that can ONLY be used with a certain brand of Orly polishes.  </li>
      <li>1/2 clear</li>
      <li>The shifting effect is quick and very responsive to even small temperature changes.</li>
      <li>I have a blue on underneath so most of the time my nails are blue with black tips, like a gradient.</li>
      <li>Shade shifter is very sensitive to small temp changes and the majority of the time you get a really cool ombre/black tip effect.</li>
      <li>It does exactly as it says, However, it was a challenge to apply evenly, because it changes to clear when applied, due to body heat.</li>
      <li>My first application was a little sloppy because I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the gel to run so quickly, and I was left with a little pooling on the cuticle, easy enough to clean up, when it&#x27;s not cured.</li>
      <li>I love the idea behind this polish.</li>

<li> When you apply nail polish it turns clear while applying due to body heat on nails.</li>
<li> My nails look really neat with the black tips, but when my hands get cold you can see the black on my cuticles, and that&#x27;s not so cute!</li>
<li> I think the people who had problems with it &#x27;drying&#x27; are confused about what a gel is, it won&#x27;t air dry, it must be cured with a light, that&#x27;s what makes it last so long!</li>
<li> Finally they sprayed alcohol on my nails to dry it.  </li>
<li> it did however change my red into a redish pink once.</li>
<li> Dark when it&#x27;s cold, and transparent when it&#x27;s warm.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not supposed to air dry.</li>
<li> I took it to my nail salon and it wouldn&#x27;t dry,</li>
<li> It takes an hour to dry and it runny off you finger nails.</li>
<li> By this point I have left it open for a total of at least 12 hours to try to thicken it by drying it out.</li>
<li> changes to black inside and clears in the summer warmth outside.</li>
<li> It also has a slight grayish tint when clear, which can dull brighter colors underneath, which is why I only gave 4 stars.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried applying it multiple times failing every time as runs down the cuticles and down my hand.</li>
<li> Once finished applying the Black looks running and not a solid transformation to black.</li>
<li> did notice that it slightly darkened my chosen base color, (a hot pink for my first foray), but</li>
<li> And the wear time has been on par with any other gel application I&#x27;ve done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> IT DOESN&#x27;T AIR DRY!!!</li>
<li> Not worth the money, time or energy.</li>
<li> I got the nail polish in less than week.</li>
<li> Goes on a transparent black over any polish color.  </li>
<li> u apply it its clear, its will switch the color to black when cold, but not completely, so you will have 1/2 black and</li>
<li> no matter how little I had on the brush</li>
<li> I have at least 30 other nail polishes in my bathroom cabinet and NONE of them are half as runny as this.</li>
<li> I have applied multiple thin coats on my nails to avoid the dripping but no luck.</li>

    <li> This polish is AMAZING!!!!..,The effect of the color change is very neat.. I think people are confused about the application of it because it&#x27;s a gel polish..YOU MUST CURE IT UNDER LED OR A UV LIGHT...takes 30 seconds under my LED light.. I do have one complaint - it is a bit runny so two thin coats should do the trick... Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;When u apply it its clear, its will switch the color to black when cold, but not completely, so you will have 1/2 black and 1/2 clear nail.&lt;br /&gt;It wont go Orange/ red no matter what you do :(</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend because she got really excited about the idea of color changing nail polish and layering it with other colors. She loves it, shes happy, therefore I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> It takes an hour to dry and it runny off you finger nails. I shook the bottle to see if that would thicken&lt;br /&gt;up and improve the consistency of the polish, but it was still runny. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I really loved this soak off gel nail polish.  I used it over a sparkly red polish from Gelish and loved the results.  Goes on a transparent black over any polish color.  My nail color actually looked maroon with the black over the bright red.  When my hands were warm the nails were sparkly red, when cold, the nails turn back to the maroon color.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> I tried every trick in the book - dipping my finger nails in olive oil (after 2 hours), dipping my nails in ice cold water (after 2 hours), using a hair dryer. I&#x27;ve tried applying it multiple times failing every time as runs down the cuticles and down my hand. By this point I have left it open for a total of at least 12 hours to try to thicken it by drying it out. It&#x27;s still too runny. I will be continuing my attempt at thickening it up but this is basically some weird diluted frustrating nail polish.</li>
    <li> It seems alright but pools some if you don&#x27;t keep you nails even. Even so I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this polish. It&#x27;s so much fun to put over any color. And when your hands are warm it reveals the manicure underneath it. It does take 3 coats to cover light colors though. So be prepared to have a lot of polish on. It hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all though. It removes easily which is another plus!</li>
    <li> Firstly, I did not purchase this gel on Amazon, because there were better prices on eBay (around $10).  This is a gel polish and is meant to be cured under a LED or UV light--please disregard the low ratings from people that did not know what type of product they were purchasing. I also noticed low ratings from people who got pooling around the nail.  I didn&#x27;t really experience this.  Please remember to use thin coats, to prevent pooling, and to ensure proper curing of all gels.  Happy polishing!</li>
    <li> FUN!  Doesn&#x27;t have to be very cold to be totally black.  But really fun and gives you a cool ombre/french some of the time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! The people that left bad reviews didn&#x27;t read the instructions. It&#x27;s a GEL polish, meaning you need a UV light to cure it, then apply a topcoat, cure that, and wipe with alcohol. IT DOESN&#x27;T AIR DRY!!! It&#x27;s not supposed to air dry. It is very thin, so you might need to clean up the edges, and cuticles, but if you do that before you cure it, it&#x27;s super easy.</li>
    <li> This polish is soooo cool! It goes on easy, can be applied on any color, and is so fun I can&#x27;t stop staring at my nails and showing them off to everyone!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this nail polish. I have at least 30 other nail polishes in my bathroom cabinet and NONE of them are half as runny as this. Not worth the money, time or energy.</li>
    <li> takes several coats and it does affect the under color if it  is really light but the change is really neat. Im always freezing so this shows the best for me in the summer time. changes to black inside and clears in the summer warmth outside.</li>
    <li> When you apply nail polish it turns clear while applying due to body heat on nails. Once finished applying the Black looks running and not a solid transformation to black.</li>
    <li> I bought this and was super excited, so excited that I bought 2 of them.  I took it to my nail salon and it wouldn&#x27;t dry, yes they put me under the UV light.  Finally they sprayed alcohol on my nails to dry it.  It is also very streaky, even after 2 coats.  It does change color but not evenly, it&#x27;s bad.  I wasted $30.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to recieve this ítem since I have another brand of mood changing polish (Gel II) but it already comes with the color. I have been doing my own nails with gel for a couple of years now. For some reason Shade Shifter is difficult to work with. It is very watery. When I apply it, it just accumulates on my cuticles and the sides of my nail. I have applied multiple thin coats on my nails to avoid the dripping but no luck. It also comes out streaky. I recommend applying this in a cold room so you can see how the polish is being applied. I will have a profesional apply it and see if they struggle with it like I did</li>
    <li> Works well, but very runny. Be patient, and its worth it.</li>
    <li> works well. i did not have to use several coats for it to work, one seem to be just fine. it did however change my red into a redish pink once.</li>
    <li> It does exactly as it says, However, it was a challenge to apply evenly, because it changes to clear when applied, due to body heat. No biggie, just pop it in frig for a few minutes, and apply thin coats.  It also has a slight grayish tint when clear, which can dull brighter colors underneath, which is why I only gave 4 stars. I would say I am 99% happy with this - the effect is pretty neat.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  A lot of people seem to have had issues with application but the bottle that I received was a great consistency and applied very easily.  No issues at all with placement, and I only needed to use one coat (I do my own nails at home using the gelish system mostly).  I currently have this on over OPI you don&#x27;t know Jacques, and it looks awesome.  Shade shifter is very sensitive to small temp changes and the majority of the time you get a really cool ombre/black tip effect.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was a color changing topcoat. It is not. It dries dull and requires a top coat on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearing this for a few days I have fallen in love with it. It&#x27;s like a mood ring on my nails. I have a blue on underneath so most of the time my nails are blue with black tips, like a gradient.When my hands are really warm it&#x27;s all blue (or whatever color you choose as a base), when my hands are cold changes to all black. The formula was really nice but most of  all I love how my nails change color throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Whoa. This shade shifter gel fx is pretty awesome. Unlike traditional &#x27;mood&#x27; polishes or gel, you have the infinite possibilities of choosing whatever base color you feel like. The shifting effect is quick and very responsive to even small temperature changes. Seriously, I can&#x27;t stop messing with making it change, washing hands in cool water, then warm water, letting them sit over the AC in the car, it makes me amused just looking at it.&lt;br /&gt;As for the application of the gel itself, it went on smooth and easy. Though, it was surprisingly thinner than I expected. My first application was a little sloppy because I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the gel to run so quickly, and I was left with a little pooling on the cuticle, easy enough to clean up, when it&#x27;s not cured. However, because the shifting effect is so responsive it starts to go clear right as you begin applying it, so be prepared with using the less is more theory. Once you can&#x27;t see it you won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s where it shouldn&#x27;t be until after, and you can&#x27;t clean it up once it&#x27;s cured.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that it slightly darkened my chosen base color, (a hot pink for my first foray), but not so much that it was obvious unless you know your base colors.&lt;br /&gt;It gave a very squishy look to my nails along with the cool shifting effect. And the wear time has been on par with any other gel application I&#x27;ve done.&lt;br /&gt;I see this over orange next in my future for some baseball games, (go Giants!).&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an amazing gel, and has become very popular with my clients.</li>
    <li> I got the nail polish in less than week. It is great. Dark when it&#x27;s cold, and transparent when it&#x27;s warm. The polishes do not need to be the same brand either. I was worried about that, but it turned out great. More than two coats is a better idea.</li>
    <li> I really do love it! But this is the thinnest gel I&#x27;ve ever used! It ran into my cuticles and turned clear so I couldn&#x27;t properly clean it up before curing it! I&#x27;ve never used orly gel before, I&#x27;m using it on top of Essie nail polish (even though it says to only use it on orly gel fx) the color is neat! My nails look really neat with the black tips, but when my hands get cold you can see the black on my cuticles, and that&#x27;s not so cute! I will be using this again, but I&#x27;ll have someone else apply it for me! Also, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with this &#x27;drying&#x27; on my nails! It cured just fine with my finger paints brand light! I think the people who had problems with it &#x27;drying&#x27; are confused about what a gel is, it won&#x27;t air dry, it must be cured with a light, that&#x27;s what makes it last so long!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on here for this product. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and its pretty easy. Use a REALLY thin coat every time because it is a bit runny. my ombre nails are fantastic! I wish It came in other colors other than just black, but the effect is awesome.</li>
    <li> Well, it wasn&#x27;t stated that this is a GEL polish that can ONLY be used with a certain brand of Orly polishes.  Not cool at all to not list this &amp; not a happy person here.&lt;br /&gt;I would give 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I love the idea behind this polish. I found it to be a little difficult to apply because it is very thin and kept running over my cuticles no matter how little I had on the brush. I had to apply three coats in order to get solid coverage.  I will use it again but only when I have the patience to apply it.</li>
    <li> The polish goes on way too thin. And it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;shade shift\\&quot; unless its a huge temperature difference. Other wise, its just a crappy shade of black.</li>
