      <li>Like getting snapped with a rubber band, but on my underarms and bikini area it does not hurt at all in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway there&#x27;s my honest review.</li>

      <li>privacy of doing it myself in my own home</li>
      <li>I read in the directions that it can take up to 18 months for this to be effective though.  </li>
      <li>You need to be nice and pasty, if you have a tan (even a spray on one)</li>
      <li>It would be nice if it was, but the cord is a generous length.</li>
      <li>so honestly even with the downsides (slowness, sun issues, treatment length</li>
      <li>This makes me wonder how effective it&#x27;s going to be.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I am seeing quicker results which makes me super happy</li>
      <li>but I am seeing quicker results which makes me super happy</li>
      <li>Hair removal is supposed to hurt right?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use, point and click</li>
      <li>I am not one of those people who get paid or get free stuff by giving good reviews.</li>
      <li>It seems more effective to my wife then me.</li>
      <li>The flash of light it puts out can seem really bright, but if you are in a well lit room it&#x27;s not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Light-Based IPL Hair Removal System for Home Use has lots of built in safety features making me feel very comfortable using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product does need to be plugged in during use, so the photo on the box is deceiving, and it is also recommended that this product be used on fair skin with dark hair for best results.</li>
      <li>I love about this:&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am satisfied and don&#x27;t need to do again</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are many contraindications to use.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, totally recommended</li>
      <li>and I get rashes from shaving more often than not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m expecting even better results</li>
      <li>Most people get hair reduction in 4-5 treatments, and hair removal begins in 10 or more---3-4 weeks apart</li>
      <li>Please make sure you understand that your definition of permanent, is not the manufacturer&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>MOST of the rest of your body can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but mine sure doesn&#x27;t, I just sort of guess as I move it along)</li>

      <li>But definitely better than shaving.</li>

      <li>&lt;br /&gt;The better shaved areas of your skin will expose hair roots more,destroying them is the goal..</li>
      <li>The reality is probably much more.  </li>
      <li>so I expect to see much better results by then.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to buy replacement cartridges.</li>
      <li>it would be safe to say that i see just about 10% hair reduction in 5 repetitions.</li>
      <li>I just love not having to shave almost every day.</li>
      <li>Was a gift and she was pleased .</li>
      <li>Maybe shaving closer and exfoliating more will help that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I know I am a great candidate for this as I have had it professionally done.  </li>
      <li>it was easy.</li>

      <li>It is easy to use and set up.  </li>
      <li>It works fine</li>
      <li>READ THE FINE PRINT---ON THE BOX.  </li>
      <li>The adjustable intensity settings are good for sensitive people or for when you are just becoming comfortable using the system.  </li>
      <li>The hair seems to be growing faster than ever before, it&#x27;s getting much thicker and coarser causing me to have to shave more often!</li>
      <li>and as I&#x27;ve mentioned I&#x27;m a huge pain wuss...</li>
      <li>It appears to have removed hair, but honestly will have to keep doing treatments and see how much is thinned out.  </li>
      <li>It has a skin color sensor to prevent it from being used on skin tones that are not compatible with the system, a contact sensor so you can&#x27;t hold it away from your skin or stare into the light, and</li>
      <li>I cannot comment on the price, as, at this time, Amazon does not have it available for purchase, so I do not know what their price is/will be.</li>
      <li>Light brown to brown hair removal on the bikini line would require about 10-12 sessions about four weeks apart to see a 60% reduction in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>And the light didn&#x27;t flash after 3 times use.</li>
      <li>I guess you could say I am 25% hair free.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got it with coupon in a really good price. Tried it for the first time today. I used it in my lower legs and under my arms. It&#x27;s very strange that I saw the flash and heared the sound but didn&#x27;t feel anything! Yes I started from level 1. But people complain that it hurts even with level 1 right?&lt;br /&gt;Is there anything wrong with my feeling? Am I going to die?</li>
    <li> Only had one treatment and it seems to have slowed the regrowth of hair a bit some places more than others, im dew for another treatment in a week so I&#x27;m expecting even better results</li>
    <li> No use at all. The hair grew the second day. Rate 0!  And the light didn&#x27;t flash after 3 times use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just started use this,but i already have great outcome. If you are thinking that this is something for a once and have outcomes this is not for you, because this take a little more time for notice them. I mean, i only used three times y I can see the spaces without hair in my legs and armpits. But I knew that gonna take me a little while the real outcome before purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommended for those who are patients.&lt;br /&gt;Good look.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this device. I&#x27;d been going to a day spa for laser hair removal -- this costs less than one visit to the spa and I&#x27;m already seeing results, after two weeks.</li>
    <li> Painless!  Have had for two months now, and making great progress in removing hair.  I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to buy replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> The item is good so to say. But the light pulse isn’t that quick, one after the other. I don’t know whether this one what i got is like this or generally all the device are of this sort. But definitely better than shaving. I have done the first session. Feels good. Need to wait and watch. Hope for the best.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after two weeks</li>
    <li> so far no results at all.  I have fair skin and even after zapping some dark, course, hair multiple times there has been no reduction in hair at all.  I previously had professional laser hair removal at a med spa so I purchased this just to touch up some spots where I was having some new hair growth, total waste of time and money.  Do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Not&lt;br /&gt; Use every day,  after use hair remove then use it batter</li>
    <li> instructions are hard to understand, arrived as promised</li>
    <li> I bought this for my underarms and &amp;#34;intimate&amp;#34; areas ans after only 3 uses I&#x27;m seeing huge results. I don&#x27;t have to shave every 2-3 days and when I do have to shave there isn&#x27;t as much hair and its finer, softer. I did get burned the second time I used it but only because I jumped to the 2nd level too soon, I would suggest using the same level two uses in a row to avoid that problem.</li>
    <li> Good product! Deliver fast.</li>
    <li> Ok, let me say, I didn&#x27;t get this product for free, and I&#x27;ve been using it as directed for the last 4+ months, so I&#x27;ve had plenty of time to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that from right out of the box I used this on the highest setting (5) and have continued to do so each time thereafter. I don&#x27;t find it to be painful at all on the legs, and I&#x27;ll say it can be &#x27;uncomfortable&#x27; elsewhere (underarms and bikini) but definitely not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to tell where you&#x27;ve already treated, obviously, and it is also quite time consuming to do a consistent job ( I usually put something on TV and flash away). I&#x27;m petite, so not as much area to cover, but I&#x27;d still say a full treatment of legs, underarms, and bikini line in one go would probably take just over an hour. Wish the treatment head covered a larger area but I knew it would be tedious before I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely fair skin and dark coarse hair, and I have to say, this WORKS to make hair thinner, finer, and grow much much more slowly. By the 4th or 5th session I definitely noticed a big difference. By the 8th and 9th session I had big bald patches on my legs. I most definitely have to shave less often, which to me is a huge improvement. I&#x27;ve never before been able to go several days between shaving and still feel ok to wear dresses or shorts.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m still continuing treatments about every 2 weeks, even though it says you can reduce the frequency after 4 sessions. I will also say that this for whatever reason, seems to work best on my legs. I haven&#x27;t seen quite as good results on my underarms and bikini line as far as hair growing in MUCH more slowly, though it is finer and more sparse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m super excited with this product. If you have realistic expectations (this won&#x27;t make you a hairless baby overnight), then I think this is totally worth the money. Will definitely keep using until it burns out (its still going strong for me with several months of regular use) and I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since January with amazing results. I truly hate shaving and I live in Florida, so I don&#x27;t really have an option to not do it because it&#x27;s too hot to wear pants all the time. The first time I used it I noticed it took a little longer for the hair to come back. Same with the second time. Each time the difference is more dramatic. But after using as directed for the past few months, I can now go 2 weeks without shaving without noticeable regrowth. I&#x27;m still only on my 5th treatment and you are supposed to go to at least 8 so I expect to see much better results by then. I have since started using it on my underarms because I have darker hair and I used to get like 5 o&#x27;clock shadow the next day after shaving but my armpits were too sensitive to shave daily. Again, I have noticed a significant change in the amount of hair and the length of time it takes to grow back. I don&#x27;t care if it ends up coming back in a few years like some people have mentioned. I just love not having to shave almost every day. I&#x27;ll buy another one if I have to and start over.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all.  Boo.</li>
    <li> Was a gift and do not have answer.</li>
    <li> The surface are full of scrathes. It is more likely to be used instead of a brand new one. Feel so disappointed. Because I am a oversea shopper, which makes me hard to return the good.</li>
    <li> works well, but I used for one month and my hair still going fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product since the beginning of April and after using it MAYBE 5 times, it no longer works. It will emit one pulse and then die. Despite being plugged in and everything seeming to work, it no longer does what it is supposed to. EXTREMELY disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it, much much cheaper than other laser removal, and it just did the same work!</li>
    <li> this thing doesn&#x27;t work. i had 5 sessions on my hands so far and the hair keep coming back. it would be safe to say that i see just about 10% hair reduction in 5 repetitions. every time on the highest setting. do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> After using a few times,hair easy to pull out.Insist on should have effect</li>
    <li> does Not work for me at all so i gave it away</li>
    <li> Hair removal effect in general, there is a burning sensation</li>
    <li> Good so far. It seems more effective to my wife then me. And yes, it will take a very long process.</li>
    <li> this product does not work. I thought that because it had a high star rating that it might, but I was misled. Turns out that a lot of these high ratings were from people that were given the product for free and had to write a review after 30 days. The product claims you can see results in 4-5 session. Sessions 1-4 are supposed to be spaced 2 weeks apart, so that&#x27;s like 2 months. How can they review it after 30 days?! I did 8 sessions on two different areas of my body (lower legs and bikini area) and saw zero results in either area. The real reviews are catching up to this product. I paid nearly $200 and now it&#x27;s selling for around $130. Total waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> I have always had more hair on my legs than the average girl, and I can shave yet have stubble within a few hours. I have olive skin so I was concerned my skin wasn&#x27;t ideal. However, I did my 3rd two week apart treatment tonight and I am pleasantly surprised. I was NOT expecting to be even 25% hair free by now so perhaps my expectations were low. I went into it thinking even if I only do my underarms that would be great. My main concern was my legs of course. So after about a week from the first time, I noticed I would feel my unshaven legs and they weren&#x27;t as prickly. Then I realized there were small  patches of no hair. After the 2nd treatment, I noticed several blank patches and my hair was softer still. It was also obvious which areas I missed accidentally as it is hard to know exactly where you leave off. The light is small. And there isn&#x27;t a guide. You just guess. It does take about 1 hour per leg/underarm, but only twice a month. Update after 6 treatments: The patches without hair are more numerous, but some large patches I am sure I treated every time seem to be exactly the same as it was before I started. I guess you could say I am 25% hair free. Really, I still have to shave just as often as before BUT I&#x27;m hoping eventually I will be troubleshooting small patches rather than all over treatment. Some places, like my lower belly were DONE after two treatments. So it does work, but I&#x27;m wondering how long I will be motivated to keep trying in areas like the outer muscle part of my calf with no results. It&#x27;s hard to wait two whole weeks before trying again. I can now do everything I&#x27;m concerned about in 45 min. So I may be getting faster or due to hair loss I don&#x27;t quite have to do as much. It&#x27;s hard to remember where I needed to treat after I shave, which is when you do it. UPDATE-5 months in. I am now 50% hair free. Shaving is super fast as 1/2 of the work is done for me. Areas I started targeting that seemed slow to take effect are getting thinner and thinner. It is unbelievable!</li>
    <li> I just got this baby today and I am happy to report that this laser hair removal device works on North Indian skin!&lt;br /&gt;I will write a detailed review later but here&#x27;s my 1st impression anyway...&lt;br /&gt;You have to hold on the big &#x27;laser trigger&#x27; button as you press it on your skin a little and it would flash every few seconds,the flash is much like flash of a camera and relatively very painless even at level 4..&lt;br /&gt;The better shaved areas of your skin will expose hair roots more,destroying them is the goal..&lt;br /&gt;If you leave hair before,you might feel singed burned sensation with a burned hair and thats less than pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;As you apply the laser pulses,you just feel local warmth,I can easily tolerate level 4,will try out level 5 too.&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t work on upper lip area of the face as its too close to eyes,but other than that the device CAN be used on face too although this product says its not meant to be used above the neck.&lt;br /&gt;It has 5 levels,works on Brown skin  East/South Asian skin (Ind,China/Japan,Pakistan etc)&lt;br /&gt;I think it would work on olive complexions of the middle easterners just fine too (Israel,Lebanon,Arab countries) but thats just my opinion...&lt;br /&gt;I am using it and will update my review time to time,if you want to ask me anything ask me in the comments below and I&#x27;ll try my best to answer :-)&lt;br /&gt;Thx</li>
    <li> Was a gift and she was pleased .</li>
    <li> My wife usually uses an epilator or shavers to remove unwanted hair from her body.  Veet Infini&#x27;Silk Light Based Hair Removal System is the first of this type of device to reduce unnecessary hair that she ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is similar in size to an epilator and is easy to use.  The area should be carefully shaved before each use of this machine (which has 5 power levels). You just need to press several times to select the power level. During the first use, my wife has progressed in accordance with the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations and chose the weakest level (1). In the second application she chose power level &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; and the third application she used &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;5.&amp;#34; Between the fourth and fifth power levels she noted almost no difference when it comes to pain or discomfort. Certainly there is greater discomfort by applying it in the place where the skin is thinner, for example under the arms or in the vicinity bikini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already after the first application, she noted that the hair on her legs and armpits grew back much slower. Normally the next day tiny stubble is visibale. However, when she used Veet Infini&#x27;Silk Light Based Hair Removal System the first hair began growing back after about 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer assures us that the first permanent results we should be noticed after 4-5 applications. At this time, my wife is not able to determine whether the product actually works just like the manufacturer assures us, because she did not used it long enough. No doubt she is very satisfied with the fact that the hair does not grow back as fast as it did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is intended for people with fair skin and dark hair. It will not be at all effective for people with dark skin or light, red or gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a few months I&#x27;ll try to let you know whether Veet Infini&#x27;Silk Light Based Hair Removal System meet my wife&#x27;s expectations and the claims of the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving, then again who doesn&#x27;t? I think I tried my first hair removal item back in highschool... back then it was one of the early models of coil epilady devices and it felt like a million tiny bees stinging you at once... needless to say I didn&#x27;t keep using that one. I chugged along with shaving my adult life (I&#x27;m almost 40 now) as I&#x27;ve always been too lazy/cheap/awkward to go to a spa or salon for any sort of treatments and my few trials with wax weren&#x27;t worth repeating (also ouch). I did decide to try out an epilator this past year but I&#x27;ll be honest with you, I&#x27;m a huge wuss with pain (as in I get nauseated &amp; throw up) and instead of a million tiny bees this was more like hundreds of medium sized bees... I used it a few times on my lower legs but just couldn&#x27;t stand the pain, so I use it now on my toes only, I always managed to cut my toes shaving them so even though it hurts it&#x27;s been great and the hair barely grows back now so I rarely have to do it... but that still left me shaving my legs with a razor or the &amp;#34;crap I didn&#x27;t shave and my legs are furry and we&#x27;re going out in 10 mins quick grab the &amp;#34;it sort of works&amp;#34; electric razor&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all that said I was super excited when I saw this at home (no awkward moments in a salon) option. I also almost chickened out once I read all the warnings and honestly if you&#x27;re considering this I&#x27;d plan to use it in the fall or winter when you don&#x27;t expect to be outside in the sun at all... the main thing was me stupidly thinking &amp;#34;oh awesome, I can use it this spring and be hair free all summer&amp;#34; well 1) it doesn&#x27;t work that way, this will hopefully reduce your hair but that will take MONTHS of use and did I mention those warnings? You need to be nice and pasty, if you have a tan (even a spray on one) it won&#x27;t work correctly, it might not even work at all as it reads the pigments in your skin/hair follicle. You are recommended to stay out of the sun, it&#x27;s in the 90&#x27;s and summer here andI have kids, even with sunblock I&#x27;m going to be in the sun, A LOT. So I am using it but I might have to stop for a month or so if I end up with an unintentional tan... thus using it in the fall or winter when you will be keeping your leg covered is probably ideal. Also note that you are only supposed to use it every 2 wks... ONCE every 2 wks, and it takes at least 4-5 sessions to see anything per the package... I&#x27;ve done 3 so far and I&#x27;m going to have to agree, I really don&#x27;t see any decrease in hair growth yet... I&#x27;m hopeful I will though since it&#x27;s SO EASY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No really, it takes awhile... this model only has a small area that gets zapped at a time and you&#x27;re supposed to carefully move along while not overlapping (there is a claim of it leaving some sort of indentation or marks but mine sure doesn&#x27;t, I just sort of guess as I move it along) so plan for I&#x27;d say at least 30mins if you&#x27;re doing both legs, longer if you&#x27;re slower or not as &amp;#34;bendy&amp;#34; LOL (it can be a challenge to get the backs of your thighs trying to cover every area). The great news is though that there is NO PAIN... I mean NOTHING, NADA, ZIP (at least for the first 3 setting which is all I&#x27;ve tried so far), it warms up a bit but I felt nothing remotely close to pain and as I&#x27;ve mentioned I&#x27;m a huge pain wuss... so honestly even with the downsides (slowness, sun issues, treatment length) I still really recommend this and cross my fingers that it works. I&#x27;d love to only have to shave every few days instead of nightly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this one I&#x27;ve used it for a few more months!</li>
    <li> it really cost a very long seconds to wait a pulse, I am not sure if it works ok, wait to see the effect</li>
    <li> after 3-4 time, my leg hair has significant reduced</li>
    <li> This CORDED hair removal system seems like a dream come true, right?  Not really.  Before you think about buying this, read ALL of the information about it (skin tone, hair color, health conditions, etc....).  By reading those you may find out you don&#x27;t \\&quot;qualify\\&quot; to use this product.  I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, one treatment doesn&#x27;t work to zap your hair.  Neither does a second one.  You have to do several over a period of several weeks.  During the treatment phase, you also have to shave.  :(  This is so the laser can get to the root of the hair.  At first you&#x27;ll notice that there are levels.  The higher the level, the more you&#x27;ll feel the laser.  I chose level 3.  As you can see from the picture, the laser head isn&#x27;t very wide.  To me, that&#x27;s where part of the problem lies.  You can easily miss sections of your leg (or whatever you&#x27;re treating) and get uneven results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item can&#x27;t be used on your face.  :(  You&#x27;ll still have to go to a professional if you want laser treatment for facial hair.  MOST of the rest of your body can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of patience and don&#x27;t mind some hair re-growth, then it&#x27;s a good product.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, totally recommended</li>
    <li> Little results after consistent use. Not worth the price or the effort.</li>
    <li> This Hair removal system is easy to use, but takes &#x27;forever&#x27; the light flashes as you go down your leg, but each flash covers only a very small area...so to use this you do need time and patience.  10 treatments are recommended but over a period of time, as in months...so this is not a fast process by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt, you don&#x27;t really feel much of anything during the process....I only noticed that the &#x27;flash&#x27; is warmer as the setting goes up.  You can choose from 1-4 for strength and it is recommended that you use the highest setting you are comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does need to be plugged in during use, so the photo on the box is deceiving, and it is also recommended that this product be used on fair skin with dark hair for best results.</li>
    <li> The first positive thing I noticed is that even on 4 (of 5 settings with 5 being the highest intensity) this is far less painful than the epilator I previously reviewed :) However, while the epilator offered instant results (because it rips the hairs out by the root, ouch!) the Veet Infini&#x27;Silk Light Based IPL Hair Removal System does not. It definitely does require multiple treatments over multiple days. While my legs are by no means hair free they definitely feel less stubbly by the end of the day and I can sometimes (although not often) go without shaving my legs on the second day without my legs looking terrible, which isn&#x27;t something I was able to do before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Light-Based IPL Hair Removal System for Home Use has lots of built in safety features making me feel very comfortable using it. It has a skin color sensor to prevent it from being used on skin tones that are not compatible with the system, a contact sensor so you can&#x27;t hold it away from your skin or stare into the light, and a quick disconnect power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some users have said, the pictures of the device on this page make it look like it might be cordless when it is, in fact, not cordless. However, I found the cord to be plenty long enough to sit comfortably on my bed or in a chair and zap my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the instructions for how to use the device were detailed, easy to read and easy to follow, the instruction booklet failed to include instructions for how often I should be using the device. There was a chart indicating the number of weeks to use the device and what the expected hair reduction rate was, but it didn&#x27;t tell me how often per week I should be using the device. Once a day? Twice a week? Every other day? Once a week? I don&#x27;t know! I did use it on my legs once a day for about four days straight and didn&#x27;t seem to have any ill effects from it although your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I get brave I&#x27;ll try it on my underarms and let you know how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the item for now but only time will tell if the results are really worth it.r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the item for now but only time will tell if the results are really worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now.  So far I have seen very little reduction in my hair growth.  I have used this on my under arms, legs and bikini line. I read in the directions that it can take up to 18 months for this to be effective though.  I will continue to use it every two weeks for that amount of time and see if it actually reduces the hair to an amount worth the effort.  It is painless for me (although the directions say you can feel a little bit of a hot burning sensation and it says that if you use it on the highest setting you may experience burns.  I have not had this as a side effect or anything. I have notices a small reduction in hair around my Bikini line. My leg hair seems to be about the same but it is now more blonde ( I have very dark brown hair normally) so it is much harder to notice the hair that is there.</li>
    <li> I received this through the Amazon Vine program so I&#x27;ve only had an opportunity to use this 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was excited because I thought it was a cordless model, as shown on the picture on the box. This turns out not to be true: it is corded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s small and light.&lt;br /&gt;* It fits comfortably in right and left hands.&lt;br /&gt;* It lets you hold down the button and keeps pulsing light, after a recharge, making it quick and easy to treat large areas like a leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* It hurts not at all. Why is this a con? Well, in my experience, laser-based hair removal that is effective actually hurts - less than epilation, and less than electrolysis, but it still hurts. This makes me wonder how effective it&#x27;s going to be.&lt;br /&gt;* Battery/lamp not replaceable. This means that you&#x27;re disposing of this item when it&#x27;s finished, rather than just replacing the lamp. This is the first system I&#x27;ve used where the bulb was not replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;* Area of treatment from the bulb is small. This means that while the bulb is good for 50k pulses, you&#x27;ll be pulsing a lot more frequently to get large areas treated.&lt;br /&gt;* If you aren&#x27;t using the hold/pulse technique, it can be hard to see the indicator whether the bulb is recharged enough to pulse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got to demo the Infini&#x27;silk PRO, and I&#x27;d choose that over this item. It has a larger treatment than this model. This cuts down on the amount of time needed for treatment. It also has a replaceable bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 treatments, I have seen no decrease in hair, no hair loss from the areas, and I started out at level 5, having already had experience with IPL. I&#x27;ll continue to update as I use these products.</li>
    <li> This Veet hair removal system may be just what I need.  It is easy to use and set up.  It has a good instruction book that covered all questions that I had about usage and side effects.  I was a little cautious about using a laser hair removal device because I am black.  I have never seen anyone on the commercials or talk show promotions mention skin color as a factor, but it is.  I do not have dark skin, but I do have very dark hair.  Actually skin and hair color have to be considered.  It is all detailed in the safety warnings, but basically, you can&#x27;t have dark skin or light hair for it to work.  There has to be a color contrast for the laser to correctly target the hair follicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to the picture, the system is not cordless.  It would be nice if it was, but the cord is a generous length. The system is not bulky or awkward to use.  The adjustable intensity settings are good for sensitive people or for when you are just becoming comfortable using the system.  The actual pain is tolerable to me even on the highest setting it reminds me of the snap of a rubber band.  The removal process is simple, but time consuming.  I worry about the fact that you have to be careful not to overlap your pulses and the treatment area is very small.  You are only supposed to treat the same area once every two weeks, so I haven&#x27;t had time to get the full effect of the treatments.  I have mainly used it on my legs so far because I never wear shorts, so they aren&#x27;t tanned.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any loss of hair growth yet, but it does seem like it may be growing a bit slower than usual.  I will continue to update my review throughout my treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small problem that I have is that the system is supposed to be stored in a place where it cannot get anything on the light area, but no container or pouch is supplied.</li>
    <li> I received this to try back in May. You start out using this only once every two weeks after shaving, then once every four weeks and then you treat as needed. The first couple treatments I didn&#x27;t see any results. The next couple treatments I noticed a difference in the coarseness of the hair, it seemed too be a bit finer and softer, seemed it was growing slower and some places not AS much. I&#x27;ve recently completed my 6th total treatment (the second time 4 weeks apart) and sure am seeing a difference.. but not a positive one. The hair seems to be growing faster than ever before, it&#x27;s getting much thicker and coarser causing me to have to shave more often! Kinda defeats the purpose of using the Infini&#x27;Silk. I will keep using this, although I may just go back to using it once every two weeks to see if that helps. As of right now I don&#x27;t see this being worth the price tag at all, which is a shame, I was really looking forward to having positive results.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet.  First treatment and No reduction of hair</li>
    <li> how often do i have to use it? like do i skip a day or two to let my hair grow after shaving or i use it whenever i want?</li>
    <li> Does what it says its suppose to do</li>
    <li> This review is for Veet Infini&#x27;Silk Light-Based IPL Hair Removal System For Home Use, with non-replaceable cartridge. I can highly recommend this product. I purchased it when it was on sale and I believe it is one of the best ~ $100 s I ever paid. I followed the instructions carefully and after the 8th treatment I can confirm that I observe significant hair reduction in the areas I have used with more black hair. As mentioned in the instruction booklet, I have observed less reduction in areas with brown hair. It is true that it has a smaller effective emitter area when compared to other products, however, the 50,000 pulse cartridge feature over-shines that disadvantage in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> Effect is not as good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking of trying out laser hair/IPL removal after I saw the first NoNo hair removal commercials.  Then I would go online and read some of the reviews and found that the results were less than stellar and the customers seemed very unhappy with the results.  I&#x27;ve continued to look at them as new ones have come on the market, but after weighing the cost, with the results described in the reviews it just didn&#x27;t seem worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate shaving.  Hate.  I&#x27;ve used Veet hair removal cream before and it works well, but smells awful!  Not to mention all of the chemicals used to remove the hair, so when I saw that they had a light hair removal system that wasn&#x27;t outrageously priced I decided to finally give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is based on my first two treatments, and as the instructions imply it can take 4-5 to see the results you want (in essence several months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first treatment took me about 30 min.  I decided to try on my underarms first as the hair there is coarser and darker.  I have very pale skin so I figured if it was going to work, this would be the perfect trial spot.  It took me about 30 min to do both.  It was easy to use and I didn&#x27;t experience the amount of pain that I expected after reading reviews of other products.  The picture on the box doesn&#x27;t show a cord, but this product does have to plug in.  A bit inconvenient, but I actually prefer that since you don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery losing it&#x27;s charge before you are done with the area you are working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice much change after the first treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second treatment went a bit faster since I knew what I was doing.  However, the light area is not a bit area so it will never be a quick process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that there might be some hair reduction after this treatment...at least enough that I am willing to continue with the treatments.  I&#x27;m hopeful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m impressed with this hair removal system.  I don&#x27;t know if I should be worried about all of the warnings this product has, or if they are being cautious against lawsuits.  I do wish that it worked on more hair colors than just dark.  The hair on my body is practically a rainbow of hair colors.  The hair on my legs and underarms are dark and should respond well to the IPL.  The hair on my arms and elsewhere I might want to use it is much lighter and I fear falls into the blonde, red, white category that they say you shouldn&#x27;t use it on.  I wish there was one light treatment that worked on it all.  Face, body, any hair color...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m doubtful that I will truly get permanent hair removal, even though this product says that you can.  Please make sure you understand that your definition of permanent, is not the manufacturer&#x27;s.  They describe permanent as &amp;#34;Permanent hair reduction is defined as a long-term stable reduction in the number of hairs re-growing after a treatment regime.&amp;#34;  Set your expectations accordingly.  If I get anywhere near to permanent hair removal then I&#x27;ll be happy.  I&#x27;ll try to remember to update the review with my subsequent treatments.</li>
    <li> My hair actually grew in faster and thicker then before using this product. I used this 3 times  and I know I am a great candidate for this as I have had it professionally done.  Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Veet Infini&#x27;Silk IPL Hair Removal System  is a consumer grade item that&#x27;s designed to reduce unwanted hair on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it used Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) and not a Laser, it&#x27;s safer to use overall, but isn&#x27;t as effective as a Laser. Like Laser, the unit works best when the user has light, untanned skin and dark hairs since the light has to penetrate the skin and be absorbed by the hair root. Coloring light hair dark will not work, since only the hair shaft is darkened and the light won&#x27;t be absorbed enough to have any effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is very light and simple to use. There are multiple intensity settings and the user is instructed to begin at a lower level and work upwards to reduce the likelihood of burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the unit is very simple. You position the unit on a shaved area, press the button then move to the next area. The process is very time consuming and multiple treatments are required over several months since some hairs are actively growing while others may be dormant and won&#x27;t be affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to have help in reaching some areas effectively. My daughter began using the unit at the same time as I, but her summer tan made her skin too dark to continue for her. In the nearly 30 days I&#x27;ve used the unit, I&#x27;ve seen a slight reduction in hair density. I plan to keep at it several months more at least and will post updates as things progress.</li>
    <li> This thing zaps flashes of light rather quickly. It gets hot and you can really feel it with every burst.  Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair growth. I&#x27;m a somewhat hairy (not like an ape or anything) slightly light skinned male. I used it repeatedly over nearly 3 months and found no difference in hair growth.</li>
    <li> Ive had this for a month and used it everyday on high by company recommendations I have perfect skin tone and hair and have not seen much reduction in hair growth</li>
    <li> Took a bit of getting used to, but once we got the hang it was easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for 144.99. I am not one of those people who get paid or get free stuff by giving good reviews. I bought this on March 13th and it is April 9th. I used it the first day on the first setting but didn&#x27;t realize I needed to shave first so I waited 2 days and used it again after shaving (and reading the directions). This time I also started my bikini zone area as well. I know the directions that come with it say to wait a certain period of time (i think like 4 weeks) before using again but I&#x27;m not one to follow directions (so I&#x27;m not recommending you to do as I do, this is just my experience with it). The instructions say any sooner than what they recommend and it can have a reverse effect.&lt;br /&gt; Anyway my underarm hair has always grown back over night which I&#x27;ve hated. I am white with a very mild year round tan colored skin (so white but not pasty white...) and live in the middle of missouri (so we get about an equal amount of all 4 seasons). My hair is dirty brown, but my underarm hair and bikini zone hair is almost black. After I used the second time on my arms I did it again after about 4 days. Then I waited about a week and did again. Then I noticed my underarm hair hadn&#x27;t grow back in about 3 days and when it did it was less course. (Oh, did I mention my hair is very course in both places, after a day it normally looks like a mans 5 o&#x27;clock shadow if not worse). Once I noticed the hair had grown back some I shaved and did again. I am noticing really good results. Right now my hair is taking about a week to grow back and it is much thinner and way softer. Hair removal systems do take time. I understand they are not going to be an over night fix. But I am very very glad I spent the money I was very hesitant on spending for this, but I calculated how much professional laser hair removal costs and considering they make you wait weeks before coming back and where I found it was like $200 a setion, this was worth a try. I have now started using it on my upper lip just because I am 30 and I know that hair only gets darker with age. It does not hurt. The first setting feels like a small blow of warm air. I now use it on 5 (the highest setting) and it doesn&#x27;t bother be either. I can say that more sensitive areas (like the back of the neck) do hurt a little on the 5. Like getting snapped with a rubber band, but on my underarms and bikini area it does not hurt at all in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway there&#x27;s my honest review. And like I said I know I&#x27;m not supposed to use more than recommended (due to possible side effects, idk) but I am seeing quicker results which makes me super happy considering summer is almost here and I wont have to shave as much. So good luck to you &#x3D;Dper lip just because I am 30 and I know that hair only gets darker with age. It does not hurt. The first setting feels like a small blow of warm air.

    <li> Good product, waiting to see if it &amp;#34;removes&amp;#34; hair as claimed.</li>
    <li> LOVE!  I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months now and I do use it a bit more then the recommended use, but am having no irritation form it and my hair growth and slowed so much.  Only down side is it&#x27;s time consuming.</li>
    <li> I went to pros for a long time. This has yet to really remove anything. I was hoping it would work on strays and my face. I have yet to see anything.</li>
    <li> READ THE FINE PRINT---ON THE BOX.  It says \\&quot;hair ******REDUCTION****** system\\&quot;.  This is not a hair removal system.  You have to do it over and over and eventually, the hair thins and goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BASIC PROCEDURE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- SHAVE the area---no waxing, SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;2- Turn on unit&lt;br /&gt;3- Go over area in small rectangles, 3x4 inches, etc. with pulse (on unit)&lt;br /&gt;4-  Most people get hair reduction in 4-5 treatments, and hair removal begins in 10 or more---3-4 weeks apart is 30-40 weeks minimum to being to see removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatments are done a few (3-4) weeks apart.  This is not an overnight process.  It might take you 1-3 years to actually get any kind of noticeable permanent hair removal.  Some friends of ours claim to see thinning after 5-6 treatments, and the hair getting finer, but so far nothing for us.  I don&#x27;t think anyone knows what will happen after 5, 10 years because these home units are relatively new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it might be good to use in cooperation with other methods, but do not think you can do this and hair will magically fall out and be gone.  NO.  So far after one month we have noticed NOTHING.  However, that has only been 2 treatments.  We bought it thinking it would work immediately.  Not happy but we are willing to hang in there and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.  Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> waste of money.  piece of do do...</li>
    <li> Good But the range is too small..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products as directed for almost three months. And my hair is coming back thinner and slower then it was. In a month my hair is at the point it would be two weeks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to others; with the recommendation to get it near winter time, so that by time spring/summer gets around the results will be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, be careful about using the 5th setting. I have burns on my arms from the strength. but after a month they have gone away.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is worth it. I use much more frequently than suggested. I couldn&#x27;t wait two weeks between when clearly the hair was continuing to grow. It doesn&#x27;t work like laser where your hair immediately falls out. It can continue to grow, and later some do fall out as with laser. I do it as frequently as every 3-4 days, depending on growth. One area I worked on is complete, and took maybe 5-6 series over the course of a month-6 weeks. I am satisfied and don&#x27;t need to do again (it&#x27;s been without hair for almost a month). Another area has significant improvement, and I expect will be complete in a few weeks. This takes a very small amount of time...just a minute or two for small areas like underarms. I have not tried on legs, I can imagine that would take a lot longer.  Also, I use on level 5 every time. Try a lower level first, but if you have no reaction, bump it up as high as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this:&lt;br /&gt;-the cost (very very low compared to laser and you can do areas you would not have considered with laser)&lt;br /&gt;-the privacy of doing it myself in my own home&lt;br /&gt;-the time (I don&#x27;t have to schedule an appointment, drive up there, have someone else do it, pay, tip, etc)&lt;br /&gt;-I also love being able to re-do an area again in a few days to a week. With laser I feel compelled to wait the requisite 4 weeks given the cost involved. At that point, I sometimes felt that I missed the window of time where a hair was in active growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that you don&#x27;t have the immediate results like you do with laser. A little patience is required. I agree with others who say that it take a long time to see results using as directed. My approach is to use it again within a few days of seeing growth again. Otherwise you will be looking a glacial time, and won&#x27;t notice the reduction even though it&#x27;s happening. If you aren&#x27;t having any negative reaction, use up to twice a week.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  The device is easy to use, and low on the pain scale - mostly it&#x27;s sensitive bits like the underarm that make me yelp.  At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working, as other users were posting results after the 2nd or 3rd use and I wasn&#x27;t seeing any, but now after the 5th application I&#x27;m seeing several large areas of low or no growth (front shin area) and multiple smaller spots of low/no growth all over the lower leg.  If the hair reduction continues at this rate I&#x27;ll consider this one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made - with an Irish/Italian/German genetic background I&#x27;ve got pale skin and DARK hair that can be seen even after shaving.  Killing at the root like this will make my life much easier.  Beats the heck out of waxing, that&#x27;s for sure!  Edit 9/11/15: The hair reduction has continued!  Just as good, shaving now lasts for days instead of hours as the hair thins out.  Got my money&#x27;s worth out of this one, and still going.  Step 2: thighs. XP</li>
    <li> Like it alot as now I can do hair removal at home. Size of the device is right size for me to hold. I used level 1 &amp; 2, personally feel no impact on hair removal. Level 5, the speed of pulse become slower and slower. So normally I use Level 3 for sensitive areas and Level 4 for arms &amp; legs.</li>
    <li> The heat&lt;br /&gt;Stinging&lt;br /&gt;Not removed.</li>
    <li> I used it twice in 4 weeks. I have seen noticeable change. I am light skin with low volume dark underarm hair.  Some hair just stopped growing.</li>
    <li> My daughter is trying out this product.  She was lusting after a similar product advertised on television and was thrilled to have the chance to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because she doesn&#x27;t happen to be in any of the numerous categories of people who apparently cannot (or should not) use this product, she has been using it for a couple of weeks.  (Read the warnings carefully -- lots of skin types, medical conditions, etc., are not candidates for this type of hair removal.)  So far, the results are fairly scant, but she hasn&#x27;t suffered any of the side effects that the manufacturer warns may occur.  We&#x27;ll update this review as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the unit is simple to use.  Unlike some, the flash bulb does not appear to be replaceable.  After its lifetime of thousands of flashes, that apparently is it for this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for an update in a month or so.</li>
    <li> Good condition need to fix good on hand or leg to get flash</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product that, if used correctly over a long length of time, will become obsolete. Once hair growth is eliminated, you will no longer need to use the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had Infini&#x27;Silk for over a month but I have only been able to use it twice. It should only be used once every two weeks for the first few sesions, as per the lengthy instructions. I&#x27;m not sure how other reviewers have been able to use it four or more times during this period.....but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that this is not a hair remover, it is a hair growth eliminator. Prior to using, you will have to shave (not epilate, not wax) the area you are planning to treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What comes in the box? The device, an electric cord and a 50 page instruction book with very, very small type in English, French, and Spanish. This very small type is unfortunate as the instructions are detailed and considerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many contraindications to use. Some are printed right on the box, some are only printed in the small print. Yes, this laser only works on fair or light skinned people with medium to dark hair, but it also should not be used if you have recently:&lt;br /&gt;- used self-tanner&lt;br /&gt;- used or applied Retin-A, topical retinoids, Alpha or Beta-Hydroxy Acids, Accutane&lt;br /&gt;- taken aspirin, ibuprofen, tetracycline, steroids, or diuretics&lt;br /&gt;- have been exposed to strong sunlight in the last 4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;- have a tattoo&lt;br /&gt;- have freckles, scars, moles, or dark spots&lt;br /&gt;- suffer from psoriasis, eczema, cold sores, herpes, epilepsy, or keloidal scarring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you should not expose the treated area to strong sunlight for at least two weeks, and if you must, be sure to wear SPF of at least 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the best time to use this device is the dead of winter when almost no parts of one&#x27;s body is in danger of being exposed to the sun......or coated with self-tanner or body creams containing retinoids or Hydroxy Acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using the Infini&#x27; Silk in the late spring, I decided the only place safe would be to work on my bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As recommended, I started on level one. I felt no discomfort whatsoever. The second treatment I moved up to level two and used the gliding technique. This time also, I felt no discomfort. I have also seen no reduction in hair growth, so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction book states that the typical full hair growth cycle is about 18-24 month. This means that treatments need to continue for 1½-2 years in order to experience \\&quot;full results\\&quot;. Light brown to brown hair removal on the bikini line would require about 10-12 sessions about four weeks apart to see a 60% reduction in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I stick with the program? I am committed to testing this product for at least several months. Hopefully, I will begin to see some results ......s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using the Infini&#x27; Silk in the late spring, I decided the only place safe would be to work on my bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As recommended, I started on level one.

    <li> I have had professional laser hair removal treatment as well as having used one of the more expensive at-home options.  This is, by far, easier to use than the other at-home option.  It is smaller, so I can wield it much more easily, and it operates on an adapter rather than relying upon a charged battery, so there is no need to worry about running out of juice or the death of the battery pack.  I have only had it long enough to use it once, the instructions state that it should only be used every four weeks, so I will update after a bit more use to note the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be updating this review to detail my ongoing usage of this, but will detail first impressions and first usages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, of the at home hair removal (well the &#x27;permanent&#x27; variety anyways), the light based ones work the best, this device being of that type will probably have the best chance of working.  However there are only a few of these devices approved for home use so far.  It&#x27;s also different than the more powerful laser hair removal treatment that is applied by a professional (and could be quite a bit more dangerous at home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that said, you have to fit into a pretty narrow profile in order for this to work effectively.  Dark hair, light skin.  Anything else could actually cause burns and not actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to use it.  You&#x27;re supposed to shave the area and then apply it, so it&#x27;s not as simple as just going over the area with a device without much hassle.  It has 5 modes or strengths, you choose one and then push the button to activate it.  It goes through a safety check to make sure what it is pointed at is good, and then fires it off.  If you hold the button you can have it keep triggering (the idea is that you can quickly move it spot to spot, not stay in the same spot).  The higher the intensity you have set, the longer it takes to get ready for the next one.  At max, it&#x27;s at least a few seconds between things, which is slightly annoying, but doable.  In practice it&#x27;s also hard to keep track of what it&#x27;s been pointed at.  As far as pain, there isn&#x27;t much, some slight burning, but nothing more than a light sunburn would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness.  Well that&#x27;s the important thing here, and it should be noted that even with laser hair removal a lot of times the hair eventually grows back, and since hair grows in different stages, it&#x27;s going to take 5+ treatments to get it all, even if you manage to do it perfectly each time.  The reality is probably much more.  So how has it worked.  It appears to have removed hair, but honestly will have to keep doing treatments and see how much is thinned out.  I don&#x27;t have high hopes, but at least hope it can help.</li>
    <li> I have fair Asian complexion with black hair, so the light should work perfectly on me. It works fine and I do see my hair growth at at underarms reduced by a bit. I bought this mainly for my bikini area. The hair growth at that targeted areas at the bikini line have not subsided very much. But the texture of the hair does get softer by a teeny tiny bit. I used it on level 4 power as level 5 is a little painful on me. As someone who have had experienced salon IPL, this gadget is less intense and the effect is not as good as salon IPL (this is expected though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the reason why I gave it 2 stars is because it stopped working after less than 10 uses. I cant return this and I doubt it will make a lot of sense sending this back for repair to the US since I live in Singapore. Just my luck.... &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> While not a substitute for professional laser hair removal, this product offers a viable solution (fairly economical, also) for home use, as long as it is used according to the directions and all of the warnings are read and heeded. The box shows someone using the unit without a cord, but the unit is not cordless and must be plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using this on my legs and have had decent results, as, being older, my leg hair had already naturally thinned out. The areas I have treated now have almost no hair growing back after several weeks.  However, people should be aware that using this device is a very time consuming process, as each area of your body must be treated fully and slowly with the laser (and generally you only get a small area treated in one sitting). However, you only re-treat every 2 weeks, which is better than shaving every day or every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the patience, then this may be a good solution for hair removal. I cannot comment on the price, as, at this time, Amazon does not have it available for purchase, so I do not know what their price is/will be. I will update this review a little later to comment on further results.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t new, it is used.</li>
    <li> need to give it a few more weeks</li>
    <li> My wife used only two times, and the unit light didn&#x27;t turn on anymore . How can I replace it?</li>
    <li> I want to love this very bad, but I&#x27;m really skeptical that it will not live up to the manufacturer&#x27;s claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to use on my legs and underarms. I have pale skin and dark, coarse hair that grows very quickly. My skin is very sensitive and I get rashes from shaving more often than not.&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved, waxed, tweezed, epilated, and had professional laser hair removal done. I have tried depilatory creams and lotions that claim to slow hair growth. Waxing has been my go to for a few years now because the results are smooth and long lasting. I had professional LHR done on my bikini line and would get it done everywhere if I could afford it. It HURT, but it worked the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that being said, I&#x27;m hoping the Veet Infini&#x27;Silk gives me results similar to/slightly better than waxing. I don&#x27;t think the hair will ever go away permanently, but I can live with only doing a treatment once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this twice so far with about a week and a half in between sessions. Compared to waxing and Pro LHR it is painless and gives a pleasant, warm feeling while using it. This part alone makes me worry that it&#x27;s not working. Hair removal is supposed to hurt right?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use, point and click you might say. It is tough to tell which areas have already been treated during sessions. If I press hard though, it will make a slight outline of the area I&#x27;ve just treated. The outline only lasts about a second though so I have to really be paying attention. The flash of light it puts out can seem really bright, but if you are in a well lit room it&#x27;s not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet as far as hair not regrowing. The hair seems to harden after I finish a session and it gives the skin an almost sandpaper feel that is not the greatest. Maybe shaving closer and exfoliating more will help that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it&#x27;s much too early to tell if this product will make a difference for me or not so I plan to keep at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~Update 12/3/14~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just finished my third session and I&#x27;m pleased to say that I can see considerably less hair on my legs. I can go for a few days without feeling the need to shave and I am not having as much trouble with rashes after shaving. Before, I would shave in the morning and by evening there would be some stubble. Now, I don&#x27;t notice any stubble for at least 48 hours after shaving and there is much less when it does show up. I still have around the same amount of hair on my underarms, but it does seem to be growing slower. To be fair though, I didn&#x27;t have the Infini&#x27;Silk on the highest power for the first session because I wanted to make sure my skin didn&#x27;t react differently there. It was on power setting 3 that first time and on 5 since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Infini&#x27;Silk on power setting 5 on my legs since I started using it. I made sure to shave very closely beforehand so I didn&#x27;t have the sandpaper feel to my skin after the treatment this time. I&#x27;ve been doing the treatments every two weeks so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I don&#x27;t have to let my hair grow out at all to use the Infini&#x27;Silk. That was my biggest problem with waxing, the furry stage before I can get smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update again after the next session in a couple weeks : )t so I plan to keep at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~Update 12/3/14~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just finished my third session and I&#x27;m pleased to say that I can see considerably less hair on my legs.
