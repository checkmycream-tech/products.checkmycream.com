      <li>The smell is delicious.</li>
      <li>this is the best self tanner ever.  </li>
      <li>This product is the best and Amazon is the best to.  </li>
      <li>If you are a fair skinned person, this product is for you!</li>
      <li>This product produces great results.  </li>
      <li>The 3 pack was great.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizes great too.</li>
      <li>I do avoid putting it on my ankles, tends to look orange there for some reason, but great everywhere else.  </li>
      <li>This lotion I use in the summer to get my tan going, and it does a great job.  </li>
      <li>The lotion gives me a great tan but the smell is a deal breaker for me.</li>
      <li>I am delighted to find the product listed on the Amazon site.  </li>
      <li>There is no streaking and it provides a light, even color, I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>and I loved it until they changed it to a bronzer</li>
      <li>Just stared using and believe it is the best moisturizer with tanning available.  </li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Gives a nice, even, non-streaky and gradual &#x27;glow&#x27; as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I am torn on this because I remember trying this lotion years ago and loving it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 3 weeks now and have been told by several people since that I have beautiful, bright skin.</li>
      <li>So glad that I am able to buy this through Amazon....</li>
      <li>No, I don&#x27;t want to maintain a tan, nor even look like I have one, but rather want to maintain a healthy glow.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Jergins has an ok one</li>
      <li>but I love how this one works on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance.    </li>
      <li>I just need to read the product labels a bit more closely.</li>
      <li>this lotion is not what I thought it would be found some much better lotion</li>
      <li>Excellent for places that self-tanners don&#x27;t do well with such as the bony areas of your feet, legs and arms.  </li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s such an awesome lotion+tanner.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and information regarding the product is great...</li>
      <li>Just make sure to wash your hands afterwards.  </li>
      <li>no one has noticed anything \\&quot;different\\&quot; and so I&#x27;m quite pleased with Olay.</li>
      <li>I went on Amazon and was able to order it.</li>
      <li>Overall the color is good and it&#x27;s very nice to put on</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and would constantly hear comments from people saying that I need to get more sun, etc.  </li>
      <li>Olay Touch of Sun also has a light clean scent and absorbs quickly leaving a nice glow to the skin.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel feverish and to top it off, it smells really good!</li>
      <li>Touch of Sun and sure enough was successful.  </li>
      <li>Olay is a great product in all I have purchased and this product was recommended from a friend to help give some color especially to my legs for summer clothes.</li>
      <li>and that was to get a light glow to eliminate the washed out look without looking unnatural.  </li>
      <li>I like this product very much and was glad it came in a pack of three as I will use it all summer.  </li>
      <li>and it is actually quite pleasant.  </li>
      <li>love the light touch of color, but I&#x27;m sure if you want to get a darker one you would apply it in a different manner.  </li>
      <li>As a fair skinned irish girl, self tanner is a must.  </li>
      <li>The color is subtle, but flawless.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue.  </li>
      <li>Rather than rinse them I use a soap because it feels as if it gets the residue off quickly and</li>
      <li>I use this lotion on a daily basis and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>After it is absorbed into my skin I quickly wash my hands.  </li>
      <li>So this is a great product for those who need a little color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more on the watery side as far as lotions go</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and I have picked up color, but the color is more like permanent Day 3</li>
      <li>and I definitely have a nice glow.  </li>
      <li>The old one was so good, it didn&#x27;t have such a strong odor, and it did not streak at all, the new one streaks.</li>
      <li>I am more interested in my new look - gently &amp; responsibly tanned.  </li>
      <li>The smell is so strong in the \\&quot;overnight touch of sun\\&quot; and \\&quot;quench touch of sun\\&quot; that I have stopped using the product completely.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy that I purchased 3 tubes because I had I difficult time finding this in stores(drug&amp;retail).</li>
      <li>In the middle of winter, even though I&#x27;m outside for about thirty minutes a day, I can end up looking fairly washed out.  </li>
      <li>No streaking &amp; either a light or dark tan available.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to give me some color but light enough to not look fake on my very fair skin.</li>
      <li>Love the touch of sun look without the hassle of turning everything colors and having to wash your hands carefully.  </li>
      <li>Shipping is fast and cost is comparable to what I used to pay in the stores.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very disapointed in the \\&quot;new\\&quot; olay touch of sun lotion.</li>
      <li>It is so light weight and adds just enough glow without streaking or looking like I have put on a self tanner......</li>
      <li>it really does look like you got just a touch of sun.</li>
      <li>Use this on my face for color instead of makeup and it works very well for me.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m finding that just a light application daily is doing the trick.  </li>
      <li>So much for the tube&#x27;s new look.  </li>
      <li>will attest that I don&#x27;t really have streaks and that the color is very natural.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I also seemed to tan a little better, but could be my imagination.</li>
      <li>It does moisturize well but could give a little more color.</li>
      <li>Please note, that you should exfoliate a few times per week to make sure that no staining appears on your skin.</li>
      <li>friend also recommended [[ASIN:B001YTD3BE Jergens Natural Glow Healthy Complexion Daily Facial Moisturizer]] in order to keep up appearances so to speak.  </li>
      <li>It is a light tone which is natural for me, the fragrance is fine as long as I do not put it on too heavily.  </li>
      <li>This is the first sunless tanner I have used that actually works.  </li>
      <li>, this lotion gives me the natural looking color I want!</li>
      <li>Also, do not apply right before wearing white, it may cause stains if you don&#x27;t let the product dry first.</li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t any luck with self tanning products.</li>
      <li>Use it to get that early start on some color every March.</li>
      <li>The color is a natural brown, not orange.  </li>
      <li>I used to use it daily before they added the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; scent.</li>
      <li>I finally get a natural looking tan without getting in the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>If you remember those old Coppertone days you&#x27;ll probably think along the same lines.  </li>
      <li>I went crazy looking for it after I found how good it Tanned and moisturized my face.</li>
      <li>I am extremely fair-skinned, and the color I got from this product is very natural-looking.</li>
      <li>The secret is in the repeated application, each of which is fairly light but gives a natural glow by the end of the week.  </li>
      <li>I did notice lotion needs to dry completely before getting dressed.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone particularly sensitive to smells, but for those who aren&#x27;t sensitive or who are at least in the normal range (like myself), it&#x27;s tolerable enough to wear.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m very disapointed in the \\&quot;new\\&quot; olay touch of sun lotion. The smell is so strong in the \\&quot;overnight touch of sun\\&quot; and \\&quot;quench touch of sun\\&quot; that I have stopped using the product completely.  I used to use it daily before they added the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; scent. The lotion gives me a great tan but the smell is a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> So glad that I am able to buy this through Amazon....can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores.  It is so light weight and adds just enough glow without streaking or looking like I have put on a self tanner......</li>
    <li> Olay Body Touch of Sun has been difficult to find on the shelves lately.  I believe this is because Olay did some re-packaging.  So much for the tube&#x27;s new look.  I am more interested in my new look - gently &amp; responsibly tanned.  I am delighted to find the product listed on the Amazon site.  This product provides a natural-looking tan with minimal to no streaking, even when application is somewhat casual and isn&#x27;t proceeded by meticulous exfoliation. The secret is in the repeated application, each of which is fairly light but gives a natural glow by the end of the week.  It comes in two shades - as a blonde who does not tan well in the sun, I prefer the light/medium shade.  Olay is branding the product well...it really does look like you got just a touch of sun.</li>
    <li> Love the touch of sun look without the hassle of turning everything colors and having to wash your hands carefully.  It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands if you don&#x27;t wash them immediately.  Moisturizes great too.</li>
    <li> As a fair skinned irish girl, self tanner is a must.  I have tried them all and this one does NOT stink!  The color is a natural brown, not orange.  It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue.  Amazon is the only place I can find this product and I order it regularly.  Shipping is fast and cost is comparable to what I used to pay in the stores.  I do not know what I am going to do if Olay stops making this product...it is a summer staple for me!  If you are a fair skinned person, this product is for you!</li>
    <li> I use this lotion on a daily basis and am very satisfied with the results. This lotion has a subtle effect so there are no streaks or orange stains on the palms of your hands due to application. Olay Touch of Sun also has a light clean scent and absorbs quickly leaving a nice glow to the skin. I did notice lotion needs to dry completely before getting dressed. I am very happy that I purchased 3 tubes because I had I difficult time finding this in stores(drug&amp;retail). I highly recommend this product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am not kidding you...this is the best self tanner ever.  It is so subtle, but all my friends think I have been tanning.  I cannot find it in stores anymore, but I have ordered it off of amazon 4 time now.  I literally use it every other day and it never streaks.  You have to try it...I am hooked.  I finally get a natural looking tan without getting in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunless tanner I have used that actually works.  I was hesitant to purchase this product because some reviews stated the scent was bad.  But I find it only has a slight scent and it is actually quite pleasant.  I have only noticed a little bit of orange near my ankles, nowhere else.  There is no streaking and it provides a light, even color, I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion and use it everyday.  It doesn&#x27;t make you tan but just gives enough color especially during the winter months. I have very fair skin and would constantly hear comments from people saying that I need to get more sun, etc.  Well, I can&#x27;t because of previous skin cancer issues.  So this is a great product for those who need a little color.  Please note, that you should exfoliate a few times per week to make sure that no staining appears on your skin. Also, do not apply right before wearing white, it may cause stains if you don&#x27;t let the product dry first.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much and was glad it came in a pack of three as I will use it all summer.  It is a light tone which is natural for me, the fragrance is fine as long as I do not put it on too heavily.  I only use it about once every couple of days and that is enough.  It is just what I hoped it would be.  Wish I could pick it up at drugstores though.</li>
    <li> The color is subtle, but flawless. The smell is delicious. This is the only self-tanner I have ever used that has actually worked, and I will never - NEVER - use any sunless tanner but this product again. I am extremely fair-skinned, and the color I got from this product is very natural-looking. It does not feel oily or sticky. I have applied it only twice in the past two days, and I can see the color already. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have some seen some pretty artificial results but I love how this one works on my skin.  I do avoid putting it on my ankles, tends to look orange there for some reason, but great everywhere else.  I am fair and this gives me a little color without looking artificial.  I also seemed to tan a little better, but could be my imagination.</li>
    <li> I am torn on this because I remember trying this lotion years ago and loving it. After that bottle, I could never find it again until I stumbled onto it via Amazon, where it comes in the three-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the main thing would be to say that I am definitely not disappointed---but I am also not really thrilled. My skin is soft and I have picked up color, but the color is more like permanent Day 3 and I have used it about 4-5 times a week now for two weeks. I also use the Aveeno daily exfoliating scrub, so that might have something to do with it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will attest that I don&#x27;t really have streaks and that the color is very natural. I just don&#x27;t know if it is as dramatic as Jergens would be by this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like the lotion and deal with the color because Jergens makes me break out, but I think it&#x27;s a little &#x27;eh&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they changed their product.  The old one was so good, it didn&#x27;t have such a strong odor, and it did not streak at all, the new one streaks.</li>
    <li> Did not add any color to my pale skin. I should&#x27;ve got a darker color. So far I haven&#x27;t any luck with self tanning products. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> This lotion I use in the summer to get my tan going, and it does a great job.  It also moistens my skin</li>
    <li> I was pleased that I didn&#x27;t experience any streaking and the color was good, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell, it&#x27;s an awful chemical smell.</li>
    <li> In the middle of winter, even though I&#x27;m outside for about thirty minutes a day, I can end up looking fairly washed out.  No, I don&#x27;t want to maintain a tan, nor even look like I have one, but rather want to maintain a healthy glow.  I&#x27;m not using this as an all-over body lotion, but rather one to moisturize my face and, of course my neck to maintain an even color.  I was turned onto this by a friend who wanted to use it for a different purpose and that was to maintain that tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend also recommended [[ASIN:B001YTD3BE Jergens Natural Glow Healthy Complexion Daily Facial Moisturizer]] in order to keep up appearances so to speak.  No, I don&#x27;t want to look as if I have a tan, nor do I want to use makeup so I&#x27;m finding that just a light application daily is doing the trick.  FYI, this does not have an SPF, but the Jergens is rated as a 20.  I&#x27;m using just a little bit, about the size of a dime, and rubbing it into my face and along my neck each night.  After it is absorbed into my skin I quickly wash my hands.  Rather than rinse them I use a soap because it feels as if it gets the residue off quickly and thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the light touch of color, but I&#x27;m sure if you want to get a darker one you would apply it in a different manner.  I haven&#x27;t tried to get that tanned look because that&#x27;s not what I want.  The washed out look is gone and I definitely have a nice glow.  One friend was worried that I&#x27;d turn orange, but that decidedly was not on the Olay agenda.  If you remember those old Coppertone days you&#x27;ll probably think along the same lines.  Does it work?  Yes.  It did what I wanted it to and that was to get a light glow to eliminate the washed out look without looking unnatural.  Works for me and no one has noticed anything \\&quot;different\\&quot; and so I&#x27;m quite pleased with Olay.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to give me some color but light enough to not look fake on my very fair skin.</li>
    <li> Just stared using and believe it is the best moisturizer with tanning available.  The 3 pack was great.  I will use it all summer.  Olay is a great product in all I have purchased and this product was recommended from a friend to help give some color especially to my legs for summer clothes.</li>
    <li> This lotion slowly keeps a base line tan going. I love the fragrance.    Meg F.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the brown spots on my legs looked darker after the application, and the product definitely has a \\&quot;smell\\&quot; to it!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like a mix between banana and cat pee.  Let&#x27;s just get that out of the way.  Why four stars?  Because it&#x27;s such an awesome lotion+tanner.  Gives a nice, even, non-streaky and gradual &#x27;glow&#x27; as advertised.  Excellent for places that self-tanners don&#x27;t do well with such as the bony areas of your feet, legs and arms.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone particularly sensitive to smells, but for those who aren&#x27;t sensitive or who are at least in the normal range (like myself), it&#x27;s tolerable enough to wear.</li>
    <li> Use this on my face for color instead of makeup and it works very well for me. I have tried other products but some have burned by eyes if I get the lotion too close; this product doesn&#x27;t.  FYI, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This product produces great results.  No streaking &amp; either a light or dark tan available. Use it to get that early start on some color every March. Just make sure to wash your hands afterwards.  Also never leaves a stain on clothes.</li>
    <li> It does moisturize well but could give a little more color. I&#x27;m afraid to go to the next color level though, because I just know it would be too dark. Oh well. This is acceptable color, I suppose. So, four stars.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years.  I was on my last tube and decided to try and locate&lt;br /&gt;Olay Touch of Sun and sure enough was successful.  Thank You</li>
    <li> I ordered what I thought was another product of Olay.  This may do the same thing but it is not the same product. I just need to read the product labels a bit more closely. I thought this was the same product, just a change in the packaging &amp; labeling that companies make from time to time.</li>
    <li> I do not get the Olay Body Touch of Sun Daily Moisturizer but I do get the Olay Touch of Sun Daily Moisturizer and Face self Tanner. My friend bought a tube at The Christmas Tree Shop, did not like it and gave it to me. I loved it. I went crazy looking for it after I found how good it Tanned and moisturized my face. I could not find it anywhere. I went on Amazon and was able to order it. I tried a simmilar product from Clinique and I loved it until they changed it to a bronzer and it was to fake looking so I stopped using it. Jergins has an ok one but if I start to sweat it comes off onto my shirt collar. I stopped using that one too. I hope that Amazon will continue to sell it to me and notify me when it looks like they cannot get it any longer. This product is the best and Amazon is the best to.  Fast shipping and information regarding the product is great...They don&#x27;t keep me guessing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;Reggie and Debbie</li>
    <li> this lotion is not what I thought it would be found some much better lotion I did not see where you look like you never got a tan</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Buy a supply every summer.</li>
    <li> No streaking AS LONG AS YOU APPLY IT DAILY OR EVERY OTHER DAY, if you try to go every 3rd day you get some splotchyness. Overall the color is good and it&#x27;s very nice to put on</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It gives my skin the glow that I want without going overboard and making me look like I&#x27;ve been using a tanning lotion! It isn&#x27;t a self-tanning lotion so it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel feverish and to top it off, it smells really good! It&#x27;s more on the watery side as far as lotions go but I like this about it because it makes it easier to apply to larger areas. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 3 weeks now and have been told by several people since that I have beautiful, bright skin. No longer the pale girl I used to be, this lotion gives me the natural looking color I want!</li>
