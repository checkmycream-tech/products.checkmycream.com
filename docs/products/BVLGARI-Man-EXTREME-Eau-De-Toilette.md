      <li>I am so glad I found this on Amazon for the price.</li>
      <li>Amazon must do everything to make sure that bootlegs are not sold through it.</li>

      <li>Actually better than the sample I had.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with price, you can&#x27;t find this locally for that price anywhere.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want a strong cologne, but I do want it to linger throughout the day; this one does not.</li>
      <li>It is a very masculine scent - pleasant smell</li>
      <li>The cent is just fine</li>
      <li>Shipped fast:)</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>Mild scent not too strong with a very masculine scent.</li>
      <li>Great scent, but it does not last for more than an half an hour to an hour.</li>
      <li>My man puts this one on and I&#x27;m ready to take him to bed!  </li>
      <li>I have gotten so many &amp;#34;you smell good&amp;#34; comments that i&#x27;m gonna buy another bottle before my current one runs out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;NO ITS NOT THE REAL THING!</li>
      <li>Only thing better is Tom Ford Oud Wood</li>
      <li>/&gt;AMAZON has sold me a handful of knock offs since i first started buying scents on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have purchased cologne from Amazon before and have always received authentic stuff - I don&#x27;t know if this has got something to do with the the third party (Discount Fragrance) involved here</li>
      <li>Italian men are manly and this is even my favorite smell as his wife.</li>
      <li>Very convenient spray applicator.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s $85 at Nordstrom, you&#x27;ll have to pay it if you want the real thing.</li>
      <li>This cant be the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But very mood lifting grape fruit scent.</li>
      <li>but this has been a very experience.</li>
      <li>I really wanted this for My husband.</li>
      <li>IT!(the real parfume</li>
      <li>Very masculine orange manly smell which I can not pinpoint but its a mans, man smell!</li>
      <li>I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>its a clear bottle coated (if you understand what I am saying) if you were your self to scratch the bottle it would &amp;</li>
      <li>I purchased from amazon directly.</li>
      <li>Smells close to the same but the scent is gone in minutes vs. the real one.  </li>
      <li>Does not smell as good as I hoped for&lt;br /&gt;Bottle difficult to use</li>
      <li>Smells great and a lot less expensive than high end stores!</li>
      <li>No imitation.  </li>
      <li>I read the other reviews and thought, &#x27;it&#x27;s amazon, surely it&#x27;s not fake.&#x27;  </li>

    <li> Loved it and Arrived before time</li>
    <li> This cant be the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO ITS NOT THE REAL THING! Goes away in an hour and nothing is left behind (NO SCENT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to go into how it smells because as I said its FAKE (NOT AUTHENTIC)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle was &amp;#34;defective&amp;#34; so the &amp;#34;knock off kings&amp;#34; didnt do a very good job on this one as you can see in the picture the lines in the bottle like cuts in the glass it self! It wasnt made after the manufacturing it was DURING! If it were these cuts and defects wouldnt be silver in color becuase the bottle it self is a coating and not made of that silver/grey its a clear bottle coated (if you understand what I am saying) if you were your self to scratch the bottle it would &amp;#34;bleed through&amp;#34; and it would take off the finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UPC code taken off and one was taped on! LMAO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON has sold me a handful of knock offs since i first started buying scents on Amazon. While many were authentic this one and others were and are NOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures speak for them selves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This **when authentic** is a GREAT smelling fragrance! Very masculine orange manly smell which I can not pinpoint but its a mans, man smell!</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly.  Love the product!</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve ever bought. Definitely for the collection. Mild scent not too strong with a very masculine scent.</li>
    <li> Purchased &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; but the cologne box was already opened...</li>
    <li> I like the scent although initially the scent was off. My complaint: bad longevity and projection. But very mood lifting grape fruit scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake.  I read the other reviews and thought, &#x27;it&#x27;s amazon, surely it&#x27;s not fake.&#x27;  It&#x27;s fake.  Smells close to the same but the scent is gone in minutes vs. the real one.  It&#x27;s $85 at Nordstrom, you&#x27;ll have to pay it if you want the real thing.</li>

    <li> ITS A FAKE ! DONT BUY IT!(the real parfume its great but NOT THIS ONE)  YOU CANT SEND IT BACK</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. However the price is great.</li>
    <li> this is one of those fragrances that you dont notice after you spray it on but everyone else does.I have gotten so many &amp;#34;you smell good&amp;#34; comments that i&#x27;m gonna buy another bottle before my current one runs out.</li>
    <li> I think that three price I paid on this site was fair. However, the product itself didn&#x27;t meet my expectation. The cent is just fine but Bvlgari dad made better fragrance gran this one. EXTREME is definitely not PARFUM. The cent does not last all day as &amp;#34;eau de parfum&amp;#34; does.</li>
    <li> Fast service and perfectly packaged!!!  The product was as described...and was in time for Christmas, even though I had waited almost till the last minute on my shopping!!  :-D</li>
