      <li>Great size, good quality, nice color, excellent price!</li>
      <li>And my daughter loved it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m make up artist, I bought three for my classes and this is certainly one of my best investments.</li>
      <li>But it was for my daughter anyway, which works out kinda nice.</li>
      <li>I liked this product for the color (of course) but also the fact that I can just pick up and move it anywhere I need without having to plug it in.</li>
      <li>Magnification is nice.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty good and great for a teenager.</li>
      <li>I read reviews here that the light isn&#x27;t very bright, but I decided to buy it anyway, b ecause it was so cheap</li>
      <li>, it is a good mirror, its fine, but it&#x27;s not what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute but the light is not as bright as I would have liked</li>

      <li>, I wish that portion had been just more mirror instead.</li>
      <li>It looks more than it is</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I give it three stars because it is cute</li>
      <li>Love the mirror.</li>
      <li>but i was expecting something better...</li>
      <li>but the color really is cute, and I like the magnifying side.  </li>
      <li>You can do better.</li>
      <li>However, I like the color, and the mirrors itself are okay</li>
      <li>Since purple is her favorite color</li>
      <li>I would get a better quality model.  </li>
      <li>(yes, I read the dimensions) and the light isn&#x27;t super bright.</li>
      <li>I bought this mirror and light set to have better lighting while putting on my makeup.</li>
      <li>Mirror is ok if you do not need the light.</li>
      <li>I LOVED the color of this so much</li>
      <li>(I need a brighter light and more magnification for more detailed application).  </li>
      <li>Very nice looking product but light is very very dim.</li>
      <li>so I was hoping that this would be an easy and affordable solution to my problem.  </li>
      <li>The mirrors themselves work fine</li>
      <li>Got for Christmas and battery or either light burned out by February.</li>
      <li>I still need another light source.</li>
      <li>and you can&#x27;t even tell when the light is on.</li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like the light to be brighter, although I suppose you don&#x27;t want it to be blinding either.</li>
      <li>i bought this because it was really cheap as an add on item and the purple would match my vanity.</li>
      <li>So if you need a light all around the mirror don&#x27;t purchase this one.  </li>
      <li>Light stopped working immediately.</li>
      <li>I think the light could be brighter.  </li>
      <li>She loves it because it is purple and has a light</li>
      <li>i love the color, fan of purple violet plum , but the light isnt that bright enough to help me color</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a mirror with a light, look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I was excited to purchase this mirror as an add on item.  </li>
      <li>They are just getting into makeup and were excited to receive them.</li>
      <li>but the light wasn&#x27;t really bright and the mirror broke 4 days after me receiving it &amp; the batteries that came with it died the same day after using my mirrior for 20mins the day I received it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t buy it for the light, I just wanted a simple swivel mirror to do makeup in my dorm room.</li>
      <li>This is made of plastic and takes batteries which run out quickly.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly, works well</li>
      <li>This is the first lighted mirror I&#x27;ve tried and I know it&#x27;s cheap, but I wouldn&#x27;t even bother.</li>
      <li>A handy little mirror for travel, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily because it isn&#x27;t that sturdy and the light is not that bright.</li>
      <li>The light is not all around the mirror it only appears at either the top curve or on the bottom curve of the mirror.  </li>
      <li>For the price, it was worth it though.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I bought this, but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>But it was useful in the days I had it.</li>
      <li>I bought this to be able to apply my make-up in the early morning without having to hold a mirror or turn on the main light and wake mu hubby up.</li>
      <li>Well everyone was right</li>
      <li>The light barely gave off any light and didn&#x27;t help anything</li>
      <li>As listed everywhere else, yes the light is very dim.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to love this mirror but the light is not very powerful, and it just feels bulky</li>
      <li>the batteries die very fast never will i will be so upset</li>
      <li>Not very bright but very handy to have.</li>
      <li>But I am satisfied with it because of the low price.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was battery at first.</li>
      <li>The color is exactly how it appears and the devise works</li>
      <li>However, the light is so dim that it provides almost no improvement to my situation.  </li>
      <li>Dont waste your money its not as good as it looks in the picture.</li>
      <li>Not that the dim light really made a difference in the first place.</li>
      <li>If I could I probablky would have spent a little more on one with a better light.</li>
      <li>im going to suck it up and use it because im too lazy to return it and spend twice as much for a good one</li>
      <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t care for is that the light is not as strong as I would like it to, BUT the directions do say you can change out the light bulbs, so you could possibly get brighter lights (they do caution about overheating--with every other light mirrors as well).</li>
      <li>This is a nice little make up mirror for the price.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, I threw away the packaging and then 2 days later, the light wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect a lot of light from this mirror, it barely lights up, bought it because it was purple to match my nine year old daughters room, five stars for pretty color.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The lighting on this does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Okay for my 13 year old, but will be purchasing something of a little better quality in the future.</li>
      <li>I deem it too small to actually be effective</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not worth more than $5 to me.</li>
      <li>But my biggest problem is that it uses alot of batteries (meaning the light draws alot of energy and we have to change batteries often) for the low dim it gives</li>
      <li>I use it in the living room and it is better than my little compact mirror I had been using.</li>
      <li>, it is really too dim to see anything.  </li>
      <li>unfortunately, the light on this is hardly bright enough to even see the mirror in the room.</li>
      <li>This is a good mirror but the light on it does no good at all unless you&#x27;re in the dark</li>
      <li>The light brightness was the only thing that I have an issue with, but again, possibly fixable.</li>
      <li>i knew some aspects of it would be cheap but the light dosent really do anything, unless the power went out its useless.</li>
      <li>A few days after I got it, I accidentally knocked it against the edge of my desk, not too hard, but it was enough to put out the light for good (not that it made a difference</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much smaller than it appears and drains batteries unbelievably fast.</li>
      <li>are so dim or something.</li>
      <li>Ordered this product twice and each one completely drained batteries after only a few days use and was not in use for more than 15-20 min.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use it much as it&#x27;s just a odd height</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s flimsy, too, so light that I&#x27;m not sure</li>
      <li>Light is not very bright.</li>
      <li>The light lasted only a few days before it stopped working and the batteries exploded and started leaking fluid.</li>
      <li>Purchased two of these for my young teen nieces.</li>
      <li>My 13 year old daughter wanted a lighted makeup mirror for her 13th birthday.  </li>
      <li>When you turn this thing on it barely lights up the bulbs</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice looking product but light is very very dim. Does not last very long with batteries. I turned it on and the lights went out within 2 min.</li>
    <li> This mirror is lightweight and perfect for my 7 year old diva to gaze at herself. The batteries that came with it only lasted about 2 days though.</li>
    <li> I opened it, tested it, noticed that the light is a dull yellow glow (not enough to see without another light on behind it) and decided to just keep it and use it with another lamp behind it. It&#x27;s flimsy, too, so light that I&#x27;m not sure jt&#x27;s even metal. I think it might be metallic plastic. Anyhow, I threw away the packaging and then 2 days later, the light wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. Defective and I can&#x27;t even return it because I threw away the packaging. Save your money, folks, don&#x27;t buy this junk.</li>
    <li> disappointed, light was not very bright</li>
    <li> i bought this because it was really cheap as an add on item and the purple would match my vanity. i knew some aspects of it would be cheap but the light dosent really do anything, unless the power went out its useless. the mirror face is a BIT small but definatly doable. im going to suck it up and use it because im too lazy to return it and spend twice as much for a good one but if i would have saw it in person i would never buy it.</li>
    <li> the batteries die very fast never will i will be so upset sorry but i was expecting something better...feel upset</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these for my young teen nieces. They are just getting into makeup and were excited to receive them.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror and light set to have better lighting while putting on my makeup. When you turn this thing on it barely lights up the bulbs are so dim or something. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> The lighting on this does absolutely nothing. This is the first lighted mirror I&#x27;ve tried and I know it&#x27;s cheap, but I wouldn&#x27;t even bother. I ended up giving this to my daughters to play with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but the light is not as bright as I would have liked but it was an add on item and it&#x27;s satisfactory for the price.</li>
    <li> If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. The light is useless!!!!!! What a waste! Cheap and you can&#x27;t even tell when the light is on.</li>
    <li> The actual mirror is a little smaller than I thought it would be (yes, I read the dimensions) and the light isn&#x27;t super bright. Okay for my 13 year old, but will be purchasing something of a little better quality in the future.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. I wish I would have gone to Ross or Target. This is made of plastic and takes batteries which run out quickly. Also the lighting is poor</li>
    <li> Mirror is top-heavy and where it is attached to base broke after 4 months.  I would get a better quality model.  I kept this on my desk and never dropped it.</li>
    <li> The mirror, itself, was what I needed, the light of mechanism was very pale and weak. Total let down. I still need another light source.</li>
    <li> Since purple is her favorite color I knew this was the one I needed to buy.  She says it is wonderful!  It takes up a lot less space than the larger mirrors with the rows of lights down each side.  Perfect for her bathroom vanity.  And she informs me that it works great!</li>
    <li> I LOVED the color of this so much I almost kept it, but ended up returning it because the light was worthless. I wanted it for some extra brightness to put on makeup (to get rid of shadows) but even in total darkness you could barely tell it was on.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The light lasted only a few days before it stopped working and the batteries exploded and started leaking fluid. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Useless mirror. The light is horrible &amp; crappy &amp; the mirror is make of a cheap plastic material .</li>
    <li> Love the mirror. Hate the light. It&#x27;s not strong enough to even show up when your doing your make up.</li>
    <li> Does not light up the face even in a dark room.  It only glows. The product is not worth it.</li>
    <li> This mirror meets my needs for basic make-up application (I need a brighter light and more magnification for more detailed application).  I recommend this mirror for basic, day-to-day, no frills make-up application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like the light to be brighter, although I suppose you don&#x27;t want it to be blinding either. Magnification is nice.</li>
    <li> I was excited to purchase this mirror as an add on item.  I have poor lighting in my room for makeup application so I was hoping that this would be an easy and affordable solution to my problem.  However, the light is so dim that it provides almost no improvement to my situation.  However, I like the color, and the mirrors itself are okay so I&#x27;m keeping the product.  But I would suggest purchasing a different lighted mirror if you are considering buying this one.</li>
    <li> Like this mirror but the light wasn&#x27;t really bright and the mirror broke 4 days after me receiving it &amp; the batteries that came with it died the same day after using my mirrior for 20mins the day I received it. But it was useful in the days I had it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product twice and each one completely drained batteries after only a few days use and was not in use for more than 15-20 min. each day. Returned both and will not order again.</li>
    <li> A handy little mirror for travel, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily because it isn&#x27;t that sturdy and the light is not that bright. But I am satisfied with it because of the low price. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter wanted a lighted makeup mirror for her 13th birthday.  She loves it because it is purple and has a light and it is her makeup mirror.  I think the light could be brighter.  But my biggest problem is that it uses alot of batteries (meaning the light draws alot of energy and we have to change batteries often) for the low dim it gives off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give it three stars because it is cute and my daughter loves it plus it didn&#x27;t cost alot of money.  So, if the gift was for my daughter and she is happy with it - then I am happy.</li>
    <li> Light stopped working immediately. Not that the dim light really made a difference in the first place. It sucks though I like that it is purple that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to be able to apply my make-up in the early morning without having to hold a mirror or turn on the main light and wake mu hubby up. unfortunately, the light on this is hardly bright enough to even see the mirror in the room. For the price, it was worth it though. I use it in the living room and it is better than my little compact mirror I had been using.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Light is not very bright. Planning to return. Mirror is ok if you do not need the light.</li>
    <li> The light barely gave off any light and didn&#x27;t help anything, I wish that portion had been just more mirror instead. A few days after I got it, I accidentally knocked it against the edge of my desk, not too hard, but it was enough to put out the light for good (not that it made a difference really.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t buy it for the light, I just wanted a simple swivel mirror to do makeup in my dorm room. The mirrors themselves work fine and I like the color.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, works well but the light is useless.  If you need a mirror to put on your makeup at the office or in your dorm this should work well.</li>
    <li> Not very bright but very handy to have.</li>
    <li> Hue color was awesome! And my daughter loved it. I guess for the money it&#x27;s pretty good and great for a teenager. But there is no mistake it is plastic</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect a lot of light from this mirror, it barely lights up, bought it because it was purple to match my nine year old daughters room, five stars for pretty color.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money its not as good as it looks in the picture. It looks more than it is</li>
    <li> This product does not last long with batteries and the light is not very bright. It is hard to use and sit down because there is not much light put out by it.</li>
    <li> Broke within a week!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to love this mirror but the light is not very powerful, and it just feels bulky, it is a good mirror, its fine, but it&#x27;s not what I was hoping for. I don&#x27;t really use it much as it&#x27;s just a odd height, the mirror is pretty small</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I bought this, but I am pleasantly surprised. It is battery powered (3AA) so a chord is not going to get in the way. There are 2 mirror magnifications (flip mirror). It is an electric purple color. There is also the &amp;#34;light ring&amp;#34; around both sides as well. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t care for is that the light is not as strong as I would like it to, BUT the directions do say you can change out the light bulbs, so you could possibly get brighter lights (they do caution about overheating--with every other light mirrors as well). I liked this product for the color (of course) but also the fact that I can just pick up and move it anywhere I need without having to plug it in. The light brightness was the only thing that I have an issue with, but again, possibly fixable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m make up artist, I bought three for my classes and this is certainly one of my best investments. Great size, good quality, nice color, excellent price!</li>
    <li> The light is not all around the mirror it only appears at either the top curve or on the bottom curve of the mirror.  So if you need a light all around the mirror don&#x27;t purchase this one.  The light is not bright at all.  Got for Christmas and battery or either light burned out by February.</li>
    <li> As listed everywhere else, yes the light is very dim. If you&#x27;re looking for a mirror with a light, look elsewhere. Another problem I had was that the box led me to believe the mirror was a lot larger than it turned out to be. I deem it too small to actually be effective so I ended up returning it. You can do better.</li>
    <li> i love the color, fan of purple violet plum , but the light isnt that bright enough to help me color</li>
    <li> I read reviews here that the light isn&#x27;t very bright, but I decided to buy it anyway, b ecause it was so cheap and i like the color.  Well everyone was right, it is really too dim to see anything.  but the color really is cute, and I like the magnifying side.  If I could I probablky would have spent a little more on one with a better light.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little make up mirror for the price. I didn&#x27;t realize it was battery at first. But it was for my daughter anyway, which works out kinda nice.</li>
    <li> This was the least expensive lighted mirror and now I know why.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  Batteries are in correctly and it worked a couple days and then not at all.</li>
    <li> This is a good mirror but the light on it does no good at all unless you&#x27;re in the dark</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed With this mirror! It&#x27;s much smaller than it appears and drains batteries unbelievably fast. The color is exactly how it appears and the devise works but if I could go back in time and not buy this product. It&#x27;s not worth more than $5 to me.</li>
