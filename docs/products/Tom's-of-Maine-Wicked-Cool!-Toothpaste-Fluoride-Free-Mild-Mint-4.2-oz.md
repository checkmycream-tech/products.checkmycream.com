<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Another fluoride free toothpaste that the kids hated. Try Jack &amp; Jill. Small tubes and more expensive, but the kids actually love that one!</li>
    <li> Too &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for my kids.</li>
    <li> This is a great mild flavored paste. The mainstream mint pastes are exceedingly minty and dare I say spicy? My kids don&#x27;t like that biting, over the top flavor. This suits our needs and its fluoride free.</li>
    <li> Slightly more mature taste for my 8 year old.  He likes it and I feel better knowing it is made with less harmful comfortable.</li>
    <li> My son uses this, but he isn&#x27;t a huge fan of how minty it is. We had some trouble with toothpaste that had fluoride and so this was our next try. We have been pleased with the results and my son seems to be getting used to it.</li>
    <li> will not buy again.  had switched to Tom&#x27;s years ago due to their commitment to conserving our waterways and more &#x27;natural&#x27; and &#x27;naturally derived&#x27; ingredients.  when we learned the family would sell the business, we had heard that part sale required these values continue on,&lt;br /&gt;but after buying this, took a more careful look and was surprised to find Tom&#x27;s toothpaste has sodium laurel sulfate as an ingredient. I am fully aware the within the product it is a small amount, but obviously we bought this for our child and they will swallow some until they learn proper technique, years from now.  in the meantime they will ingest unknown quantities of this kind of product.&lt;br /&gt;also noticed the rivers initiative hasn&#x27;t appeared on the packaging in years, so that must have been done away with too.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t have any packaging from the time before Tom&#x27;s was bought out by &#x27;big name company&#x27; but I don&#x27;t recall seeing SLS on the ingredient list.  maybe I&#x27;m wrong, either way we have to switch all our toothpaste in the house away from Tom&#x27;s.  sad.</li>
    <li> My toddler loves this toothpaste. I love that it has a mint scent not fruity so her breath actually smells fresh after she brushes her teeth. I chose the no fluoride because she has not learned to spit the toothpaste out instead of swallow it.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste my 6 yro will use and being able to have it delivered it wonderful!</li>
    <li> We love Toms and this taste just the same as the fluoride version.</li>
    <li> I liked the &#x27;original&#x27; Tom&#x27;s toothpaste.  They changed the recipe a year or so ago and it is too soft and not as good.</li>
    <li> My kids love the strawberry toms, hate this! Too yucky they say....</li>
    <li> My boys have a hard time with minty flavor, but this was great and they are very happy!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also always liked Tom&#x27;s toothpaste, we use the non fluoride ones and we&#x27;ve always had very good dental hygiene.  Very few cavities or plaque problems.  Most of our problems are from our own fault of not being diligent about taking care of our teeth.  :-)  Great products.</li>
    <li> Been a great toothpaste so I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Minty, but not too strong for my 6 year old.</li>
    <li> My kids love this and so do I. It&#x27;s fluoride free and has a mild taste of mint. Teeth feel squeaky clean after brushing. 😉</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients but my daughter hatesssss this toothpaste. I gave it to my sister and my nephew is using it now.</li>
    <li> This is a good toothpaste for anyone, not just kids. I&#x27;m not a conspiracy theorist, and my kid gets fluoride treatments (I also had them). However, at some point, you might be reaching a point of overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste cleans well and doesn&#x27;t sting. It doesn&#x27;t have little bits of plastic in it or triclosan or any of a number of questionable ingredients. It also doesn&#x27;t have fluoride, which you can decide for yourself whether you want.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old still doesn&#x27;t spit all the tooth paste out when she brushes, so I&#x27;m glad we use Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is my children&#x27;s favorite toothpaste. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients like flouride. My kids love it because it doesn&#x27;t burn their mouth like lots of natural toothpastes tend to.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to learn once I received it that the label states it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Made for Ages 8+.&amp;#34; The description on Amszon doesn&#x27;t mention this. Thankfully Amazon refunded my purchase.</li>
    <li> my kids love this flavor</li>
    <li> My daughter love this toothpaste.  Just the right amount of mint for young people.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride free so I can use on a younger child who still tries to eat a little bit&lt;br /&gt;Natural mint flavor:Not candy flavored&lt;br /&gt;Easy to open and squeeze for children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find a fluoride free mint toothpaste in stores. I think the fruity stuff promotes children eating the toothpaste. This is way better and gives him fresh breath.</li>
    <li> ....and frankly, after trying lots of natural toothpaste they hated, this gets and keeps them brushing which is pretty much the point of toothpaste.  Ok, maybe not the only point of toothpaste but seriously, when you have three boys who have all, on occasion told me they have showered or brushed their teeth when they have only turned on the water for a preset amount of time instead of actually doing it, anything that makes brushing easier is good.  The last two dentist visits have resulted in no cavities and cleaner teeth.  I&#x27;d say success!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this toothpaste! Not too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; like other tooth pastes! Plus, we love that it&#x27;s flouride free! Works great she&#x27;s never had a cavity!</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter loves this toothpaste,  She likes not using the &amp;#34;baby toothpaste&amp;#34; (Tom&#x27;s Silly Strawberry) anymore and this minty toothpaste is not too hot for her.  I like the fact that it does not have Fluoride, a waste-product of aluminum-mining.</li>
    <li> I like it, but my kiddos don&#x27;t.  lol</li>
    <li> Not the greatest taste, but my kids enjoy it without any complaints!</li>
    <li> I love that it is fluoride-free, but the kid did not like this flavor. She&#x27;s fine with most minty toothpastes, and the strawberry Toms, but this one was a no-go for her! Might be ok for some, but not loved in this house.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, taste great. My Dogs breath is minty fresh. She loves it. I wanted a chemical free toothpaste to brush my pibbles teeth to keep them tartar free, and the &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34; toothpaste must be awful. She hated every brand I tried and they all have questionable ingredients. I found Toms without fluoride and other chemicals that could potentially make her sick if she swallowed any ( I actually know what everything is and there are only 7 easily pronounceable ingredients! What parent doesn&#x27;t love that?!). I use a very small amount- about the size of a pencil eraser head- just enough to get in there and scrub her back teeth/molars really good and she really loves it, I don&#x27;t have to fight except maybe to keep the toothbrush! For now I&#x27;ve just been using a people brush but the search is on for  a good doggy toothbrush. I will be ordering this again when the time comes up.</li>
    <li> Works great, cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t have nasty taste fluoride has after you brush.. My kids love it!!! no wired taste and the mint makes it good for them.</li>
    <li> I was really just looking for some natural, fluoride free toothpaste for my 2 year old and couldn&#x27;t tell or didn&#x27;t notice that the package says 8+&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s way too minty and strong for a kid that young. Boo, wasted purchase in my case. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for older kids, but just make sure you see that it&#x27;s for older children, and not just that it&#x27;s fluoride free.</li>
    <li> Great minty non-flouride toothpaste for toddler.  I didn&#x27;t want something fruity and I wanted it flouride free.  This is perfect.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the flavor and it is Flouride free so I am happy</li>
    <li> It is really hard to find fluoride free toothpaste these days--especially for kids. We&#x27;ve been using the strawberry a long time, but I love the mint. I even use it sometimes rather than the adult Tom&#x27;s because the mint taste in your mouth fades faster. I assume because it&#x27;s less powerfully-minty for kids.</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothpaste and their breath smells great and their teeth are clean!</li>
    <li> Like that it is fluoride free. My son isn&#x27;t a huge fan of the taste, but still uses it. It might be a little strong for him.</li>
    <li> Great product perfect.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste has propolyne glycol.</li>
    <li> My kids love mint, but most toothpaste is just too strongly flavoured for kids to brush without gagging. Berry, bubblegum, and other fruit flavours are just sickening, and my kids never last more than two brushings using them. Tom&#x27;s is mildly flavoured and has no fluoride, making it great for kids.</li>
    <li> Kids love it. Very minty</li>
    <li> Not for kids under 8 years of age</li>
    <li> I love it. My daughter hates it &amp;#34;too minty&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> All three of my kids tried this product, My oldest didn&#x27;t care for it at all!! She said it left a bad taste in her mouth and she needed something to drink after brushing her teeth! She said her mouth felt clean but the taste was something to be desired. My middle child liked it.. Of course he typically likes everything and my youngest didn&#x27;t care either way! I would by it again if it was on sale but prefer something different.</li>
    <li> My 12-year-old never liked the strong mint flavor of regular toothpastes. Then we tried Toms of Maine Wicked Cool in the Mild Mint flavor. He loves it!! I can see us buying this for years to come!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My kids loved this toothpaste!  No complaints at all about brushing their teeth! Definitely recommend it.  My son actually asked when he could brush his teeth again..I  got a free sample from smiley 360 to try!</li>
    <li> I have twins and sometimes it is easier to give each their own tube of toothpaste then deal with the fights. I gave Toms to my daughter, and yesterday she told me it was already empty. Her thoughts.. either the tube was smaller then most, or her brother had been sneaking it!  Yup, brother loved it too and was into it instead of his own (other brand). Great to have a toothpast that the kids want to use and will actually sneak from each other.  \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!</li>
    <li> My kids loved the taste compared to the adult toothpaste I usually buy. Was good to try out since I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the taste of this tooth paste, she says it doesn&#x27;t burn like other ones!&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> 2 of my kids tried this toothpaste and gave it 5 stars. They liked that the mint flavor is not really strong like in many other mint toothpastes. The liked the mild mint flavor. I am hoping that they will brush their teeth longer due to this! Just so you know, I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this as we are on a mission from Smiley 360 and received a sample tube. Shes 11 so she dislikes the kids toothpastes. She loves the mild minty flavor. She recommends this to any kid over 10!</li>
    <li> I recieved a free sample of Toms of Maine toothpaste for kids from smiley 360. My son loved this new toothpaste. He said it was not too minty like all of the others he has tried in the past. The best part about it, is that it is all natural. that really means a lot to me and the rest of my family. thanks Toms of Maine!</li>
    <li> I got Wicked Cool as a sample from Smiley360 and my son loves it. He likes the minty clean feeling and I like that its natural. I was afraid he might not like it since it was mint and he loves his fruity toothpaste but he did.</li>
    <li> My 9 yr old recieved this tooth paste from Smiley360  and she loved it . It had a mint taste but not over powering and it left her mouth feeling fresh . We will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this toothpaste, she&#x27;s 10 so she&#x27;s at that age where your kind of in between toothpastes. She doesnt like the fruity kids toothpaste but my toothpaste is too strong for her so we&#x27;ve been trying out different kinds for a couple weeks now. I received a free sample of this toothpaste and she loved it! She said it&#x27;s the perfect minty flavor to where it doesn&#x27;t burn her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Recently I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360 to have my boys try out for them. They liked the mint taste and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any artificial sweeteners or dyes. I think we found them a new toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I like getting a toothpaste that my kids want to use.  The mint isn&#x27;t too strong but still refreshing.  I&#x27;m trying to get my kids used to mint toothpaste instead of bubble gum and fruit flavors.  This is helping.</li>
    <li> My kids really liked this toothpaste they want me to buy it all the time. I first got a free sample at smokey 360.</li>
    <li> My daughter tried  Toms&#x27; of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste. This was a free sample we received from Smiley 360. She likes the flavor just wishes that it was a little more minty. But if you need a softer mint then this is for you!</li>
    <li> All three of my boys (ages 15, 13, 10) tried the new Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste.  They liked it a lot and told me it did clean their teeth as well as the colgate or crest brands they were using.  They liked the flavor, not as minty but they liked it.  Thank you so much for the opportunity to try it.  We recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot; My 12 year loved the perfect balance of mint, not too grown up but yet not that kiddie flavor toothpaste! Would recommend to everyone with kids 8 and up.</li>
    <li> The mint flavor was refreshing. The kids loved that it was not strong and that the toothpaste did not produce lots of foam.  I like the fact that it also has strong cavity fighting ingredients. I will buy this tooth paste to keep my kids brushing. This was a great mission. I&#x27;m happy I was picked to receive a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great toothpaste for kids specially 8 yr olds. It has different tastes. It leaves a fresh and clean mouth and easy to use. &amp;#34; I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Fluoride Free Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> I got a free sample through smiley360 to try and I love this toothpaste cause it is mild and my son loved that it did not burn his mouth. I love that is is natural and no sweeteners added to it. Its a great product for kids 8+ they will love it for everyday use better then most toothpaste. Its a most buy.\\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My 10 year old son didn&#x27;t like it. But his teeth were nice and white. My boyfriend&#x27;s daughter loved it and smiled nicely when i asked how it tasted.</li>
    <li> So my daughter being the comedic type that she is says that Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool is wickedly refreshing. I suppose that&#x27;s a pretty good stamp of approval. When she uses it she laughs and smiles because she feels like a hipster brushing her teeth. What is even cooler is the conversations it&#x27;s stirred up at the watering hole (school). Apparently she decided to ask her friends about what kind of toothpaste they use. She told them all if they wanted a wickedly refreshing smile that they would need to make the switch to Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste. According to reliable sources at least one kid went home and asked their Mom to buy it for them. Apparently being hip is pretty important nowadays. So if it takes a cool tube and a clever name to get children talking about brushing their teeth than who am I to complain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> The kids love the minty sensation of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! paste and honestly, so do I. I always try out products myself before I give them to the children and this toothpaste is one product I feel confident giving the little ones. Both and kids and I thought the packaging was super cute, which shallow as it seems, is important when trying to encourage children to develop a dental health routine all their own. For those who are skeptical about health effects versus benefits of fluoride, this toothpaste is fluoride free- a plus. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter is quite enamored with the cool packaging and decided the toothpaste was good simply for that. I received our sample of Toms of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> We received a free sample of Toms of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste through Smiley360. I wase&#x27;t to sure that my kids would like it so I was surprised whem they did. I was surprised because I have trouble in the mornings because they do not like any of the other toothpaste brands I have bought. i will def buy it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing toothpaste - in fact, the only reason I did not give it five stars is that my 7 year old and 4 year old can&#x27;t use it yet!  My ten year old loves it though.  She says that the mint flavor is subtle and not as strong as in other toothpastes, which makes her prefer it to them.  I can vouch that her breath smells minty fresh and her teeth even look whiter after just a few days of using it.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it has no fluoride in it either! I will be buying it in the future and would highly recommend this for all kids!</li>
    <li> not only did the kids like the taste, i did too!  i always try the products i get for my kids, its only fair.  left my mouth feeling clean and fresh - and didn&#x27;t affect the flavor of my morning coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have used several different Tom&#x27;s products over the years, and this one did not disappoint.  i love that their products are natural and family friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> I received a sample from smiley 360 which my eight year old daughter used. I liked the idea of a more natural toothpaste however my daughter does prefer a stronger flavor. She did really like the look of it though which is important when getting a child to use a product.</li>
    <li> My two girls 8 and 11 tried this toothpaste and loved it not too minty of a taste. And they were happy to not have a bubblegum flavor toothpaste. I got a free sample through my 360 Smiley account to review and I will buy this for my girls again.</li>
    <li> I had received a free sample of this toothpaste in the mail and my kids love it. They always want to use our toothpaste but they don&#x27;t like the taste very much. Once I had shown them that they had their own mint toothpaste, they think its awesome.</li>
    <li> My 10-yr-old daughter has outgrown the kiddie toothpaste and their sweet flavors, but she didn&#x27;t really like the stronger minty flavor of any adult toothpaste I&#x27;ve bought for her to try. I am a member of smiley360.com, a site that will send you FREE samples (or even full size products) to try and then share your experiences with. The items received often come with very good, high value coupons to use &amp; to share with your friends and family. I received a FREE tube of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste for my daughter to try out. My daughter absolutely LOVES this toothpaste she was able to try through my smiley360.com account. I will definitely be buying this toothpaste from now on &amp; I will be passing down several unopened tubes of Aquafresh Kids toothpaste (that I stocked up on during a good sale) to my sister who has younger kids who will use it! :0)</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from smiley360.  And it seems to be a big hit at my house. The mint flavor wasn;t too overpowering like in a lit of other toothpastes out there.</li>
    <li> Very cool packaging and very cool taste! Not too intense...even the 3 yr old loved it! And he ususally says that minting tastes HOT. Would recommend this tooth paste we love Toms.</li>
    <li> My kids are picky about toothpaste that tastes \\&quot;too strong.\\&quot;  This toothpaste has a mild flavor they love and I like that it&#x27;s all natural and does not contain the dreaded tricolsan ingredient in many toothpastes today.</li>
    <li> My kids tried out Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool Toothpaste. They loved it. It did not burn their little mouths or leave tons of plaque on their teeth. They said the taste was really good. Since I have a toothpaste they love I plan to buy this again. If it work it works. At least it makes it enjoyable for my kids to brush.</li>
    <li> My almost 10-year old child liked the toothpaste very much. He likes that the mint flavor isn&#x27;t too strong and he likes the idea that there&#x27;s toothpaste that isn&#x27;t for adults but also not for little kids, i.e. for big kids. My almost 7-year old child insisted to use it too. She liked it so much. I didn&#x27;t mind since she already uses adult toothpaste sometimes but she thinks some are too minty. Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool is a great choice.</li>
    <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t usually like mint toothpaste because she says it is to spicy, but she doesn&#x27;t mind the Toms Wicked Cool and she likes that it is mint like mine. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! It&#x27;s as effective as any other toothpaste and is slightly more expensive than other brands. However, my kids say it tastes great.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothpaste and have asked me not to buy any other! I have always bought Aquafresh, but not anymore.</li>
    <li> Son really likes this toothpaste</li>
    <li> My 6 yr old loves this toothpaste. He used to use the Toms Strawberry but decided he wanted to get something new. He loves this mint flavor and it is just right for him!</li>
    <li> My kids absoluely LOVE the great taste of Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool tooth paste, and how it foams up!  I tried it the other night, and although I am a minty kinda gal, I too liked it.  Definately leaves your teeth feeling extra clean!  I would recommend this tooth paste o anyone and everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED A FREE SAMPLE OF TOM&#x27;S WICKED COOL TOOTHPASTE FROM SMILEY360.COM</li>
    <li> My kids loved the mild mint flavor of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste. We got a free sample of the toothpaste thanks to Smiley360. Now its their must have toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from Smiley360, my children were TOO excited to wait until bedtime to try it. SO up the stairs we went, grabbed our toothbrushes and brushed away!! Yummy refreshing flavor, no aftertaste, just clean teeth and happy kids!!! Came back to get more!! [...]</li>
    <li> My children are very particular when it comes to their toothpaste. When I received a free sample for being a member of Smiley360 I couldn&#x27;t wait for my kids to try it. My four year old and 7 year old happily brushed their teeth. My son usually says that minty toothpaste is \\&quot;too spicy\\&quot; for him, but there were no complaints from him on this one.</li>
    <li> My son really liked this toothpaste.  I got a free sample from Smiley360.com and my 12 year old tried it.  All natural and  a great taste.  I even caught him brushing his teeth the next morning without being asked/reminded/nagged! Great marketing calling it \\&quot;Wicked Cool\\&quot;.  It really appeals to the 8 to preteen crowd.</li>
    <li> I was a little afraid that my 10 year old son wouldn&#x27;t like this toothpaste because he doesn&#x27;t like anything with a strong mint taste. To my surprise he loved Tom&#x27;s of Maine wicked Cool toothpaste. He said it wasn&#x27;t too minty for him. So I guess this will be his new toothpaste. Thanks for the free sample!!!</li>
    <li> Received this as a Free sample and had my son try it out. He liked the taste more then any other toothpaste we&#x27;ve had for him. He did say that there was any after taste he didn&#x27;t not enjoy though. Clean wise he felt like it did the job and lasted. So over all I think its definitely got a taste quality hard to find for this age bracket. \\&quot;I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received a FREE sample because I belong to Smiley360 and my kids love it!! The smell is minty but not overwhelming and both my 9 year old and 6 year old prefer it now to any other toothpaste!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this toothpaste. We received a sample in the mail, and I didn&#x27;t think she would even use it because she has refused every other minty toothpaste I&#x27;ve given her due to being burned on the tongue by others previously. But, she was familiar with the Tom&#x27;s logo because we use the Strawberry flavor, so she was interested in trying it. She has used it every night without me having to ask her to and she&#x27;s begging me to buy a full size tube. I&#x27;m really grateful that Tom&#x27;s has created a kid-friendly mint toothpaste that she can enjoy using. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> My household received a sample of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste and my eight year old daughter (Honey) loved it. As soon as she finished the sample she begged me to buy more while we were shopping. I am so glad that she has a toothpaste that she is excited to use and really enjoys. It&#x27;s a great product for tweens.</li>
    <li> My oldest son is Autistic, and will ONLY use Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste, in Strawberry. My other two will use whatever, they&#x27;re pretty indifferent about toothpaste. With that said, they tried this and absolutely loved the flavor (the name is pretty \\&quot;Wicked Cool\\&quot; in the 7-11 age group too!). The only downside is they throw a fit about going back to the old toothpaste, so it looks like we&#x27;ll be buying Toms of Maine exclusively from now on, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great Taste kids love it.</li>
    <li> According to my daughter who hates all mint items for being too \\&quot;burny\\&quot; this one has enough mint to freshen breath but not as strong as most mint flavored brands. Plus the toms brand is natural which is nice too. I received a free sample of toms wicked cool from smiley 360!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley 360. Before giving this to my kids to try I tried it. I enjoyed the mild mint flavor and it did a great job at cleaning my teeth. My kids liked the packaging and flavor! We have two different flavors and brands of toothpaste in the drawer and Tom&#x27;s is the one they grab first!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste as a great, natural option.  Taste great and teeth feel clean.  Better yet, the kids love it!</li>
    <li> We received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! toothpaste from Smiley360. I love the fact that it contains no artificial dyes (something I&#x27;m becoming more and more conscious of), sweeteners or flavors. I also was really intrigued by the concept of a &#x27;bigger kid&#x27; toothpaste that featured a mild mint taste, since my daughter is very sensitive to anything she deems to be &#x27;too hot&#x27;. Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! toothpaste definitely lived up to it&#x27;s claim by providing a mild mint flavor (my daughter didn&#x27;t seem to mind it one bit- success!), but the aftertaste was too off-putting for my daughter to try it more than a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> We received this sample from Smiley360.  My son often complains about any toothpaste other than bubble gum flavored.  I am happy to report that he uses this and says he likes it.  It&#x27;s a plus that there are no artifical ingredients!!  Very glad to have received this sample.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter tried the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste, and she didn&#x27;t really enjoy the flavor.  She said that it tasted like a fake mint flavor. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!™ Toothpaste from Smiley360. My 9 and 3 year old really likes this paste. The 3 year old always want to brush now because the taste is not strong.  I would get this for them again. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste and would recommend to any parent!  It is fluoride free and has a mild mint taste.  My 10 year old says she really likes it and not only does it taste good, it is also smooth in your mouth!</li>
    <li> We love all of the Tom&#x27;s products for their quality, value and use of natural ingrediants. This toothpaste was awesome and my son loved it.  \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste and it has replaced my usual brand as my one and only toothpaste as it gives me that \\&quot;just been to the dentist\\&quot; kinda feeling.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old son tried this and loved it! He usually says other brands are too minty and he hates brushing. He loved brushing with Wicked Cool! I even love the name! We will be using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool from now on. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> my son hates strong flavored toothpaste, so he was reluctant to try this one. to his surprise it wasn&#x27;t strong at all. he loved the soft mint flavor. it left his teeth so bright and white. he is already asking for another tube when i go to the store. he also likes that it is natural.</li>
    <li> I was worried this would have too much of a medicine type flavor. The kids here who were able to use it really seem to like it. They loved the taste and did not think that it was too strong, it was requested to be bought again. The only complaint I have is the high cost of product!!</li>
    <li> I have really picky kids.  They&#x27;re even picky about the flavor of their oral care products.  So I was a little skeptical when I was given a free sample from Smiley360 to try.  We&#x27;re definitely all for natural and organic foods and are using more natural cleaning products.  But, I haven&#x27;t fully embraced using natural personal care products.  Mostly because I find they don&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my 8-year-old daughter try the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste this morning and surprisingly, she liked it!  She didn&#x27;t mind the flavor at all and liked the name and packaging of the toothpaste.  She liked that it was made for kids 8+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the toothpaste, too.  I found it does indeed have a very mild mint flavor.  It wasn&#x27;t strong enough for me.  If I were to use this myself, I&#x27;d probably have to apply more toothpaste to my toothbrush halfway through brushing because it didn&#x27;t seem to lather as well as my normal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, overall, I&#x27;d definitely buy it again for my kids.  I like that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial dyes, flavors or sweeteners.  Plus, it isn&#x27;t any more expensive than other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> My daughter used to HATE mint toothpaste and would only use the fruity kinds.  I received a free sample of Toms of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste and it is now the only kind of toothpaste she will use.  It has just a hint of mint, so its not over powering!  And it is all natural, can&#x27;t go wrong!!  I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool toothpaste in the mail from smiley360.  I was apprehensive of how my 13 year old son would react to something new.  He&#x27;s partial to a certain kind of toothpaste.  He really liked the minty taste and loved the look of the logo.  I think the \\&quot;Wicked Cool\\&quot; helped!  I love that it&#x27;s all Natural!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool! Toothpaste from Smiley360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen P.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this toothpaste for my kids to try.  They all loved it.  They said it wasn&#x27;t too spicy but just the right amount spicy.  It seemed to get their teeth really clean too.</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360 and my boys really seem to like it.  This morning my youngest told me we were almost out and had better get some more soon.  They like that the flavor isn&#x27;t too intense and my middle son said it feels smooth in his mouth.  When I asked what he meant he said not grainy.  He is very picky about textures and was glad he likes it.  I haven&#x27;t had to stand over him to get him to brush his teeth.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and have just placed an order for more.</li>
    <li> Only could find fluoride version locally, so glad this was available. Was looking for a not fruity not too spicy alternative and this is a great option.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Unfortunately my two year old has not figured out that you don&#x27;t EAT the toothpaste. Luckily I can feel at ease knowing this will not harm him.</li>
    <li> The kids weren&#x27;t wild about it but since we discovered it contains carageenan we will no longer be using it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360 and I&#x27;d have to say, it&#x27;s awesome! I love the taste, and so doesn&#x27;t my niece! The mint isn&#x27;t strong, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get your mouth clean. Not to mention, it&#x27;s cheap and ALL NATURAL! The one thing I don&#x27;t like, is that it does leave a weird after taste, but once you use it for a while, it goes away!</li>
    <li> The grandchildren couldn&#x27;t wait to try the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool tooth paste when it came in the mail. One liked it, one didn&#x27;t like and the third said was okay but needed a stronger spearmint taste. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My kids really like the way Toms Wicked Cool toothpaste, in fact that is all they will use now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy as we like the fact Tom&#x27;s is a natural toothpaste.  \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My son got a free sample of this from smiley360.com for the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool campaign and absolutely loves it. I don&#x27;t have to beg or stand over him while he brushes his teeth now. He loves this toothpaste. I give it an A++++++++++</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste is all natural and sold at my local health/natural food store.  I have been using this brand for awhile and was quite excited to see a children&#x27;s version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son is used to mint (adult) toothpaste and doesn&#x27;t really like any children&#x27;s toothpastes.  They are too sweet and usually \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; flavored.  He was really exited to try Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste.  He loved it!  There was no bitter aftertaste and the paste was smooth, not gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a thumbs up from him and me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My 9 yr. old didn&#x27;t like the taste at first, but has gotten used to it. Great toothpaste!I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> We have used a lot of Tom&#x27;s products and I was not disappointed with this one either.  I tried it so I would have a sense of how it worked and tasted, and the girls loved it!  I did receive this product free from smiley 360, however my opinions are always my own and are true.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for letting us try it!</li>
    <li> I received Tom&#x27;s of Maine wicked cool toothpaste for kids from Smiley 360. The toothpaste was a big hit. Great flavor so kids don&#x27;t mind brushing there teeth. And it&#x27;s from Tom&#x27;s of Maine so it&#x27;s of the best quality. I am very pleased with this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on my 9 year old daughter who i could barely get to brush her teeth. She loves this toothpaste and reminds me every morning and night that she has to brush her teeth lol. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is suitable for children over 8 years old, I seen eight months。&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is now of no use for me。I do not like it</li>
    <li> The kids seem to enjoy the flavor of this toothpaste. The fact that it&#x27;s a healthy alternative to the fluoride containing toothpaste is a pkus.</li>
    <li> My kids are not fans of the typical strawberry banana flavored Tom&#x27;s. And honestly, I can&#x27;t really blame them. So, I decided to give this wicked cool mint flavor a try. They all love it. (They are 8, 7, 5, and 3.) It isn&#x27;t as strong of a mint flavor as most adult toothpastes, so the younger ones don&#x27;t find it spicy. But it is a light mint flavor that they prefer to fruit or candy flavored toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It was for my son,he like it.</li>
    <li> The only thing that&#x27;s appropriate for my grown autistic son: minty but not too overpowering. Fluoride-free because he doesn&#x27;t understand about spitting it out.</li>
    <li> I love this fluoride free mint toothpaste option for my 8yr old. The mint taste isn&#x27;t as powerful as the adult stuff.</li>
    <li> Finally, a toothpaste my kids will use.  It&#x27;s not too minty for them but I like they are using it smell a little minty when they are done. Good product</li>
    <li> I only allow my children to use fluoride free toothpaste and my oldest child likes this kind and flavor.</li>
    <li> Children with very good</li>
    <li> Daughter enjoys this toothpaste, I need to research though, someone stated they were bought out by one of the big companies, too bad.</li>
    <li> It is almost tasteless but my child is happy with her own paste.  I am happy because it seems safer than other products.</li>
    <li> Good non fluoride toothpaste</li>
    <li> My daughter normally dislikes anything mint flavored, but she did like this Tom&#x27;s toothpaste.  She said it really didn&#x27;t taste like mint and her mouth felt fresh.  I like that it has all natural ingredients and is dye free.  I received a free product from Smiley 360 to test and review.</li>
    <li> My kids thought it was \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and not at all flavorful. It seems like a decent toothpaste, but it is very minty and super pricey. Plus kids like flavor in their toothpaste. I reviewed this for my Smiley360 mission.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample in the mail via Smiley360 and my daughter wanted to immediately try it. She has been using the Crest kids line and said she preferred the mild mint flavor of Tom&#x27;s better than the Crest. She said her teeth felt \\&quot;as clean as the dentist makes them\\&quot; and asked if this could be her new regular toothpaste. A coupon was also included in my free sample from Smiley360 and we will definitely be putting it to good use!    [...]</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360 and my son was instantly happy to try it out for me.  He loved it so much his older sister wanted to try it.  She loved it so much they both argued over who would get to use it.  Their breath smelt fresh and teeth looked squeaky clean.  The minty flavor must have been a bit more mild than regular toothpaste or my son wouldn&#x27;t have liked to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Silly Strawberry Tom&#x27;s of Maine in the past and the kids seemed to like it. It wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;too hot\\&quot; like a lot of kids toothpaste, and it&#x27;s dye-free so great for me since I was sick of scrubbing blue stains out of my sink and off the front of their pajamas. Got a free sample of this new Wicked Cool toothpaste from Smiley360 and let my 11 year old try it out. The mint isn&#x27;t \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; for him, but tastes fresh still. And still dye free. The only 2 things I don&#x27;t like is the cost, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come in a sensitive teeth formula.</li>
    <li> This is not just for kids!  Not only did my kids enjoy the toothpaste, but I did as well. A nice, subtle mint taste. I really like that it is all natural too.  I received a free sample from Smiley 360.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this toothpaste for my kiddos, and while it does a great job and the taste is great, I am sad that it contains SLS. Many folks interested in natural products steer clear of SLS, so it surprises me that Tom&#x27;s still chooses to use it. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> Both my kids liked it.. And they can be picky.  Love the natural ingredients and flavors.  Definitely would recommend to other moms</li>
    <li> Bursting with mint, NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+  was a big hit with the flavor in our house with the kids, but not with me. Ingredients include:&lt;br /&gt;coconut oil and peppermint oil &amp; one ingredient I&#x27;m not fond of though is the carrageenan. Carrageenan is disolved  by a powerful alkali solvent and can cause awful reactions in gut bacteria. Yes it evolves from red seaweed, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good in your products. You&#x27;d have to consume larger amounts of it to become worry-some, but the idea, period, that this is in a supposed \\&quot;non-toxic\\&quot; product is a farce. This would be a constant staple in our house if not for the un-natural (in my book)carrageenan carrageenan has to be removed by a powerful alkali solvent and can cause awful reactions in gut bacteria. I did receive a free sample from Smiley360:).</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool toothpaste from Smiley360. I can&#x27;t believe all 3 of my kids can agree on this toothpaste! Just the right amount of mint and not too spicy. You can&#x27;t beat all natural :)</li>
    <li> Smiley 360 sent me a sample of this toothpaste to try, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. As a mom, I was happy to see that it was all natural and especially that it was dye free. I just wasn&#x27;t sure if my son would like it, but he did. He is 11 and has been using my toothpaste for awhile because he no longer liked the kids kind that his younger brother uses, and he really liked the taste of this. :)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley 360.  My daughter absolutely LOVES this product. I am always so happy when I see a sample offer I can take advantage of, but we buy it for her as often as we can, as it is her favorite brand of toothpaste. Perfect for kids who are ready to advance from the sweet kids toothpaste, but arent ready for adult toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Great products.</li>
    <li> My kid loved this toothpaste.  So much that we bought more from Target.  Not really too enthused with the sls that it has in it though.  Other than that it cleans really good and has a great taste.  I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>

    <li> My son loves it. Not only did he said it tasted great, but he wants to brush his teeth now. I am glad I don&#x27;t have to fight him for it and the fact that there isn&#x27;t any animal ingredients and not tested on animals makes it that more wonderful.

    <li> I was a little skeptical when having my daughter try this toothpaste,being that I wasn&#x27;t too familiar with the brand. But to my surprise she loved it! She told me that it taste good and it doesn&#x27;t make her mouth burn like all the others, so i am very happy that she is now brushing her teeth without complaining anymore. Will be the only brand i buy for my daughter now. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>

He loved the taste, and that it was minty like adult toothpaste. I love that there are no artificial colors or flavors! It&#x27;s a win-win toothpaste for parents and kids.</li>
    <li> My daughter actually enjoys this toothpaste.  I was shocked since she normally doesn&#x27;t like mint.  However, this was mild enough for her taste. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was great. It was the first toothpaste that was mint that wasn&#x27;t too overly minty. Not to mention it&#x27;s natural so I love it.</li>
    <li> we got Tom&#x27;s of Maine wicked cool toothpaste from smiley360 and I was so impressed with its fun packaging and a product thats good for the kids too, and my lil one loved the flavor and wants to brush his teeth , so i m happy mamma and hopefully no more cavities!</li>
    <li> My kid liked this toothpaste and thought it was cool.  He said it wasn&#x27;t real minty and didn&#x27;t last long. It wold be better if it did.</li>
    <li> my children absolutely loved the flavor. made brushing so much better. less of a chore. definitely have found a new brand</li>

    <li> This is a great toothpaste for kids!  I received a sample from smiley360.com to try. My son loved the mild mint taste compared to the strong mint taste of other toothpaste brands.  Usually the other brands burn his mouth, but this toothpaste did not.  I like that it does not have a fruity taste to it so that it can better freshen his breath.  I look forward to buying this toothpaste for him in the future.</li>
    <li> My kids love this tooth paste because it tastes and smells like mint chip ice cream!</li>
    <li> Hey, it gets them to brush their teeth!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste! Ever since I learned that your &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; grocery store toothpaste contains some sort of sugar - for flavoring - as well as of the dangers of overuse of fluoride, I began the search for an alternative. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different fluoride-free xylitol-based (and baking soda-based, and some other formulations as well like eucalyptus etc) toothpastes before stumbling onto this one. It is very gentle on your teeth, does not overkill it with the mint and leaves your teeth squeeky-clean and gums happy. Yes I know it is designed for kids 8+. I am 8+. :) Love package design too!</li>
    <li> A toothpaste my kids and I can agree on! :-) Minty, good texture and cost effective. Plus it&#x27;s fluoride free!</li>
    <li> So happy w/my purchase and glad Amazon is selling Toms. Love the taste.</li>
    <li> Useless toothpaste, my mouth does not feel clean after I use this.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t expect this one to be ages 8 and up. ul it in the picture but not description. would be helpful in description as well</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Wicked Cool! Toothpaste for Kids from Smiley360 to try.  My two daughters age 9 &amp; 11 both used it last night and, honestly, they couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it.  My 9 yo said that she had never had a better tasting toothpaste because \\&quot;toothpaste usually doesn&#x27;t taste good\\&quot;.  In her words, \\&quot;it tasted like mint gum\\&quot;.  She also said it was \\&quot;smooth and creamy\\&quot; and left her teeth feeling really super clean.  My 11 yo said it actually makes her want to brush her teeth more often!  (This is a major accomplishment for our family.)  Based on THEIR recommendations, I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> **** Updated Because I read through the ingredients and found SLS and carangeenan.  What?  How can this be marketed as a natural toothpaste? Disapointed  in Toms. Seems like they are selling out too :(     it&#x27;s a shame because my son likes the taste, he doesn&#x27;t like the fruity ones.</li>
    <li> My very picky 9 year old didn&#x27;t like it she said it taste like the stuff at the dentist office.I didn&#x27;t think it tasted bad so I will be the one using it.\\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this toothpast for a campaign fron smilely.com. My daughter loved this toothpaste.  She liked the mild mint flavor that wasn&#x27;t strong like other toothpastes that stung her mouth. She also loved how squeeky clean her teeth were.....literally they were squeeky clean. This toothpaste was a hit in my houaehokd</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this toothpaste and my 14 and 10 year old daughters tried it. My 14 year old liked the taste and said her mouth felt clean and fresh. My 10 year old daughter did not like it, she thought the taste was too strong.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste from smily360.com so that I could review it and share my opinions with others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 4 kids (11, 11, 9, 8) all LOVED it! It is the first natural toothpaste they have tried, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but they all said that it tasted good and they would use it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m psyched that I finally found a natural product that my kids actually *want* to use!</li>
    <li> My nephew really liked the taste of this toothpaste. I was sent a sample by Smiley360.com. I have not found a natural toothpaste that had a pleasant taste before so this was a nice change! I am going to try the adult version for myself after hearing my nephew talk about the kids version!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! No more fussing with the kids to brush their teeth! The ask me now! I received a free sample from Smiley360 this in no way influenced my review or thoughts on the product.</li>
    <li> I received a Free sample of this product to try and my daughter was very reluctant at first because she says mint always burns her mouth. Though in the end she and I both tried the product and we both love it!!!  the mint is not what you would expect and she says MOM it does not burn.  I will definitely be buying more of this when it runs out!!!</li>
    <li> My girls LOVE this toothpaste!  As soon as my free sample arrived from Smiley360 in the mail, they both were off to brush their teeth.  My daughters are 7 and 9 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They love the mild mint flavor, as it is not as overpowering as other mint toothpastes.  As a Mom, I love the fact it has natural ingredients and is dye free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a fun name \\&quot;Wicked Cool\\&quot;!  What child wouldn&#x27;t want to try this toothpaste?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My son prefers a much stronger mint flavor, but I really liked this. My tongue is sensitive and this toothpaste was minty but did not burn my mouth.

    <li> The name of the toothpaste excited my son and the colors were cool.  We also really like the Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand because they are natural.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing!  It is difficult to find fluoride free toothpastes for my kids at a decent price that the mint taste wasn&#x27;t too strong.  This ones perfect for my kids ages 4-13.  I signed up for the automatic shipments to make it easier.</li>
    <li> My almost 4yr old requested to have mint toothpaste like her parents &amp; couldn&#x27;t be happier with this. Previously, we&#x27;d used the Tom&#x27;s Flouride free Strawberry flavored but it didn&#x27;t foam like the mint which was the desired effect by our child. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool toothpaste and my daughter loved it.  She said it made her mouth feel cool and refreshed!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste recently for my son to use from Smiley360. I always try out new products first before giving them to my son and I will say that this tastes to much better than the bubblegum flavored toothpaste we had been using before. The mint flavor isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as in an adult toothpaste so it is perfect for children. The toothpaste cleans well so I found it a great alternative to other brands on the market.</li>

    <li> good if your a kid, but for an adult you will want something stronger and more quality</li>
    <li> My kids loved this toothpaste.  My youngest; who I thought we be most opposed to the idea of a \\&quot;minty\\&quot; toothpaste, actually said it wasn&#x27;t too minty and it had a very nice aftertaste.  The fact that it&#x27;s dye free is an added bonus!  I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get my son tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked cool toothpaste! I was a little concerned he wouldn&#x27;t like it because we have tried mint flavors before, and he always said it was too minty for him and he didn&#x27;t like it. I thought I would have him try this since it says it&#x27;s for kids and not too minty. To my surprise not only did he not complain about it, he loves it! He said it tasted like a mint candy! The best part I like about it, is that the toothpaste is all natural which is very important to me and my family!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> This was a great mission. I&#x27;m happy I was picked to receive a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360. My son was hesitant at first, he is only 11 and enjoyed his Spongebob Toothpaste. When he tried the Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) he loved it! Now it is all he will let me buy for him.</li>
    <li> My 10 yr. old daughter sampled this product as a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.  She was not very keen on the taste, but the toothpaste did clean her teeth well.  I would recommend this product as an effective toothpaste that does not have a strong flavor.</li>
    <li> We received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine wicked cool toothpaste from a mission on Smiley and my little girl was very surprised with how great the flavor is!!  She said the minty taste was just right. This was coming from a girl who begs me not to buy minty flavored toothpaste!!  So we have found a new favorite toothpaste!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I think this product is wonderful because it is all natural. However, my 11 year old daughter was not impressed with the flavor. She did not like the taste at all. She says it is far too strong of a mint taste.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using my toothpaste because she feels grown up (she&#x27;s 8) but she says it&#x27;s too \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; for her. With Tom&#x27;s Of Main Wicked Cool toothpaste and she have the same flavor of mine without it burning her mouth. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of this toothpaste from a Smiley360 campaign. My daughter is very picky about her toothpaste, she usually only likes a certain brand and flavor. To my surprise she really likes the Toms of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste. She said it had a good taste and made her teeth feel clean.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this through Smiley 360-- my daughter tried it and enjoyed brushing her teeth.  She said it had a good taste and even brushed a little longer than ususal...</li>
    <li> My kids are not fans of the overly minty toothpaste just yet, but this was right up their alley.  They both liked it (ages 7 &amp; 10) and are now fighting over the tube.  Just enough mint to give them fresh breath, but not enough to \\&quot;burn\\&quot;.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360. This is a great tasting, mildly minty, fluoride toothpaste for children. My daughter loved it and is still using it. If you are looking for a new fluoride toothpaste for you child, check out Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure if my son would like this,he is very picky about flavors (he is autistic,and s&lt;br /&gt;rong mints or fruit flavors bother him)but to my surprise he really liked it! I dont have to fight to get him to brush his teeth now,so its wonderful to have 1 less battle to fight !I highly recommend this product and I will continue to purchase this! \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> After receiving the sample for My Smiley mission,I gave it to my son to try.After a couple of brushes,his teeth look clean and the taste wasn&#x27;t bad.I would buy this product.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from a Smiley360 campaign.  My 10 year old daughter agreed to try the product and give me her feedback.  She thought that it was OK, but nothing spectacular.  She wanted the mint flavor to be stronger and was turned off by the white color of the toothpaste.  I tried it myself so that I could add my own review and agreed with her assessment that it was a very mild mint flavor (which would be a good thing if you have a child who doesn&#x27;t like strong mint flavor).  I didn&#x27;t feel like it got my breath clean and minty (but that isn&#x27;t the goal for most kids, I guess!)</li>
    <li> This is great for the kids, my kids love it. It has no artificial dyes, sweeteners or flavors. I received a free sample of Toms Of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste from smiley360</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;  I have since bought another tube.  My kids love it and I love it because there is no begging to get them to brush because they love it!</li>
    <li> My son has tried at least 10 different toothpastes but couldn&#x27;t find one that he truly loved until he tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! toothpaste.  He said that all of the other ones were too \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; or too fruity.  This toothpaste has just the right amount of mint for children.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.com, I must say that my kids really loved it, the flavour is refreshing and age appropriate. I&#x27;ve had to buy 3 more for my other kids, I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any artificial dyes, flavors  or sweeteners, so they really care about our kids oral health, thanks!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was excited for my 8 year old daughter to try this product because she has been using this Colgate kids mint toothpaste that she says is too \\&quot;hot\\&quot; or \\&quot;spicy.\\&quot; I wasn&#x27;t aware of any other mint toothpastes for older children and I got this sample in the mail free of charge from smiley360. After my daughter used it for the first time she said it was not spicy at all, and she loved the flavor! I will be re-purchasing this for her. I got rid of all her baby-ish flavors of toothpaste like watermelon and bubblegum.Those flavors didn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for her breath. This one makes her breath yummy! haha.</li>
    <li> My sons received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s Wicked cool toothpaste to try out.  They liked that it was a mint flavored toothpaste but it wasn&#x27;t too over powering.  I like that it clean their teeth and got rid of bad breath! I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My kids thought the smell was overly minty but upon use loved the flavor and clean feel. Will defiantly be purchasing again</li>
    <li> My son loved the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste! He actually liked the minty taste and said it wasn&#x27;t too strong. I liked that it didn&#x27;t have sparkles or fruity smells that do nothing to help freshen breath. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I had to use a different kind of toothpaste for my 2 year old since its not recommended for children under 8. &amp;#34;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!™ Toothpaste from Smiley360.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this as a toddler toothpaste, but its not actually safe to swallow. As its marketed as a kids product, I was surprised. It&#x27;s ok though, the light mint is a good way to get kids used to the minty flavor of adult toothpastes.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite toothpastes.this is my son&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is great toothpaste for little ones because it&#x27;s floride free but it is still minty and gives them a real &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; of what toothbrushing is all about, not bubblegum or strawberry...my 2 year old uses it no problem!</li>
    <li> I AM A MEMBER OF SMILEY360 SO I GOT T O TRY THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE. WELL ACTUALLY MY KIDS TRIED IT OUT. THEY LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN TOOTHPASTE &amp; THAT ITS NOT THE \\&quot;BABY KIND\\&quot;. ITS ADA ACCEPTED &amp; NATURAL. ITS GOOD FOR KIDS BECAUSE IT HAS A MILD MINT FLAVOR, NOT TOO OVERPOWERING &amp; IT LEAVES NO FILM. I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> My daughter tried this toothpaste for the first time yesterday, after we received a sample from smiley.com.  She said she liked the minty flavor and also noted that her teeth felt really smooth after using it.  She asked me to buy it next time I go shopping, so that tells me that she really liked it.  I like the fact that it has no artificial colors or preservatives.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine also does not do any animal testing, so I have no problem supporting a company like that.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool Toothpaste from Smiley 360 and gave it to my 8 and 11-year-old kids to try. My daughter (who I have to beg to brush regularly) LOVED the taste! She even brushed a second time right away! My son also really liked how fresh his breath was after brushing. I will definitely buy this in the future! Anything that can get my kids to brush without a fight is a winner in my book!</li>
    <li> Have your kids like my son outgrown fruit or bubblegum flavors of kids toothpaste yet don&#x27;t have a taste for the strong mint flavors found in many adult toothpastes?  Well Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste features mild mint flavor for kids 8+. It&#x27;s ADA-Accepted to help prevent cavities, and also strengthens enamel and freshens breath. Plus like all Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes, Wicked Cool! has no artificial dyes, sweeteners or flavors. But don&#x27;t take my word for it her is what Little Man has to say after trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said a little went a long ways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also said he didn&#x27;t care for the taste or lack there of taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However he did like that his mouth felt clean and didn&#x27;t have an after taste left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mom I liked it didn&#x27;t contain dyes or sweeteners that could harm his teeth after all we have gone this far with no cavities. I also liked it was good for his teeth. That being said if he doesn&#x27;t like it then there isn&#x27;t a reason for me to buy it because it would go to waste. You however can be the judge for yourself or let your child by visiting their website HERE to purchase your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Smiley360.com.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool toothpaste and it is awesome.  My 10-year old daughter who dislikes most other mint tooth paste because she says it is \\&quot;too spicy\\&quot; loves it.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product through smiley360.com. We have a lot of kids in the house so I wanted to try and find something a little more natural for them to use when brushing their teeth.  I was a little skeptical about them not liking the flavor, but so far.. no complaints.. they&#x27;re happily using it.  Definitely a good alternative to the other brands out there.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Toms of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste in the mail from Smiley360.com. My daughter shared the toothpaste with a group of her friends at a sleepover and they all loved the taste. The toothpaste contains natural ingredients like peppermint oil and no dye. I really like the fact that the fluoride content is relatively lower than most brands I compared the toothpaste with and I intend to buy it again in the future. I highly recommend this toothpaste for children!</li>
    <li> My 9-year old son has been brushing his teeth with Tom&#x27;s of Maine products since he was a toddler.  I&#x27;ve hesitated to buy the Wicked Cool! toothpaste previously, since he doesn&#x27;t like the strong mint flavor of many toothpastes and mouthwashes.  We normally use the fruit flavored toothpastes from Tom&#x27;s.  I gave the Wicked Cool! to him to try for a few days and asked his opinion about it.  He said it was okay.  --He&#x27;s a boy... it&#x27;s hard to get a comment out of him!  I asked him if he wanted to switch to the new flavor.  He said &#x27;no&#x27;, but did say that we could buy the Wicked Cool! as well as the other flavors we normally buy.  I asked him if it made his mouth feel fresh and clean (getting adjectives out of him is hard!), and he agreed it did.  I would rate it a success with my son.  I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My kids are so picking with tooth paste. And they love this one. It is the only one they will let me buy for them</li>
    <li> My daughter has a hard time using adult toothpaste because she thinks it&#x27;s \\&quot;too hot\\&quot;. This has a great cool minty flavor without being overpowering! We love Tom&#x27;s of Maine products and this is definitely one we&#x27;ll be using around the house thanks to our free sample from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My kids are picky about their toothpaste and do not like the strong mint flavor of most toothpastes. They loved this and I love that it has no artificial flavors and dyes.</li>
    <li> Got this for my three ur old, he didn&#x27;t like it as it was too minty. The mint is too strong for a toddler, I will stick to the fruit flavors</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find fluoride-free toothpaste. This is a good price too!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot; and my kids loved it! I have one son that doesn&#x27;t really care for minty things, but he really like the flavor of Tom&#x27;s. We were really please with it and as a mom, I was really happy because all three of my kids liked it and used it.</li>
    <li> My kids have started using Tom&#x27;s recently. I love that it&#x27;s natural, and they love the flavor. It used to be hard to get their teeth as clean as I would like using regular children&#x27;s toothpaste, but Tom&#x27;s works much better.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is awesome.  My daughter REALLY likes it. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>

    <li> My 11 year old loves this toothpaste! She says it makes her teeth feel clean, but it&#x27;s not too strong (like adult toothpaste). I love that it&#x27;s free of artificial colors, flavors and preservatives.  We received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste from Smiley 360.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Smiley360 and my youngest was in love at first bruhing!!!  My oldest (who is cranky anyway) smiled and said...\\&quot;eh\\&quot; But he&#x27;s been using ever since! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I received a Smiley360 sample of this toothpaste. I love Tom&#x27;s products anyway, but this was a great toothpaste. There is no stinging, harsh sensation, and it has a great taste. A bit pricey, but woth it when you consider that you are skipping the fake additives and sugars. Will buy this!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste.  Will continue to buy it for my granddaughter.  It is also a natural product too.</li>

    <li> My son absolutly loved Tom&#x27;s of Maine wicked cool toothpaste. I also loved how well it seemed to clean his teeth and how fresh his breath smelled. I would recommend this to anyone with children! Its a great buy and a great toothpaste.</li>
    <li> We received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste through Smiley 360. I remember Tom&#x27;s of Maine as a kid and it wasn&#x27;t so great for kids. Thankfully Tom&#x27;s of Maine has become \\&quot;cool\\&quot; and designed a toothpaste just for kids, ages 8+. The only disappointment for me was that my youngest  My kids loved it because it isn&#x27;t too spicy for their taste buds and I like it because it cleans their teeth well. I&#x27;m not sure if I consider all the ingredients to be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but it is much better than many toothpastes you find in the grocery store so I am definitely more comfortable with them using Tom&#x27;s. I give it a 3 out of 5.</li>
    <li> My kids totally love the mild mint taste.  It makes them want to brush longer since it is not as strong as adult toothpaste.  It has no artificial dyes or sweeteners which I love</li>
    <li> Great tasting mint toothpaste for kids. My 8 year old daughter loved it. Left her mouth feeling refreshed! The tube is easy for kids to use on their own, and easy to squeeze. Great Kids toothpaste</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! The mint flavor is mild enough that kids LOVE it! My daughter doesn&#x27;t really care too much for the bubblegum flavors anymore but most adult toothpastes are too strong. This was perfect!!</li>
    <li> My kids all enjoy this as it has that &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; flavor/feeling without the &#x27;burn&#x27; of adult toothpaste. I&#x27;ve even used it myself a time or two when I wanted a milder mint. I am very pleased and will for sure purchase again!</li>
    <li> Found a Fluoride-free formula for my child finally!&lt;br /&gt;We use Tom&#x27;s product quite a bit, even the mouthwash so this is a good compliment.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Smiley360.com for the free sample! My 8 year old tried the toothpaste and he didn&#x27;t care for the mint flavor although he did say it was better than other mint flavor toothpaste he has tried.</li>
    <li> Thanks to smiley 360 I got to sample the tooth paste for free. While I thought the packaging was cute and kid friendly, my 8 yr old son didn&#x27;t like the taste of it. While he is one who doesn&#x27;t like a strong mint taste to his tooth paste, he said the flavor of this want strong enough and he didn&#x27;t like the taste...</li>
    <li> My son loved the taste and I love that it is natural. I got a free sample from Smiley 360 to try.</li>
    <li> I received a free trial from smokey 360. When my kids tried it they liked the taste so much they actually want to brush their teeth.</li>
    <li> For the first time, my daughter brushed her teeth without being told to.  I really like this toothpaste as she has never found a toothpaste that she&#x27;s not complained about, and this one she has NOT.  I recommend this to any parent that has issues with getting their children to brush their teeth.  I got a small sample from smiley360.com for her to use to see if she would like it...and for my honest thoughts.</li>
    <li> I got Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool Toothpaste to sample from Smiley 360. I thought my granddaughter wouldn&#x27;t like it, but to my surprise she loved it. She even insist to brush her teeth on her own now. You just don&#x27;t understand, she dislikes about every toothpaste out there. So I know which one I will be buying from now on. Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product. I had a hard time getting my kids to try it because it said mint. Once they did try it they loved it. Both my son and daughter will contine to use this product! Thank you for having a great product!</li>
    <li> My son loves this toothpaste! He didn&#x27;t want to try it at all because he saw it was mint. I explained to him that it was a mild mint. He wouldn&#x27;t budge. I told him he needed to test it out so we could let the company know if other kids would like it. I went on to explain that it may be really good and the kids won&#x27;t know unless we tell them and if it was really bad we would need to warn children everywhere so they would not try it. That worked! He decided to try it:) He really does not like mint toothpaste so I have always bought him another flavor. The first thing he said after trying the toothpaste was &#x27;Hey, this is not bad at all. I like it!&#x27; Boy, that was a relief. I asked him why he liked it better than other mint toothpaste and he said it was because it didn&#x27;t &#x27;burn&#x27; his mouth. I love that it is natural and I can trust the ingredients:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste free from Smiley360!</li>

    <li> I received a sample of this from Smiley360 and I was so excited to try it! We have major issues with our 9 year old son and brushing his teeth. At times I felt like we&#x27;re fighting a losing battle. He constantly complained that the adult toothpastes were too strong and that they burned his mouth. He also didn&#x27;t like the sweet bubble gum and candy flavored kids toothpastes. We were running out of options and getting tired of having to stand over him to make sure he brushed long enough. This toothpaste is a must for anyone dealing with this issue! He loves the taste and says he wants me to only buy this brand from now on. We haven&#x27;t had to fight him to brush his teeth or watch to make sure he brushes them well. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
