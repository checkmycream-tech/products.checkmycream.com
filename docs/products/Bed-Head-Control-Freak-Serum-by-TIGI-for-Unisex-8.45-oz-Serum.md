      <li>This is the best hair gel there is.</li>
      <li>I layer it on after my leave-in conditioner and among the millions of products I&#x27;ve tried it&#x27;s one of the best frizz fighters.</li>

      <li>I love the scent, and my hair does not feel crunchy or flake.</li>

      <li>I loved this so much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that if I actually blow-dried my hair, this stuff would work great.</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff ever for frizz and taming those flyaways I use it right after I get out of the shower while my hair is drying and also while pulling it back</li>
      <li>Hands down best product for curly hair girls!</li>
      <li>I have fine wavy hair, and this product keeps out the frizz and gives me touchable hair that still keeps it&#x27;s shape.</li>

      <li>Works great for lightly slicking back a man bun as well.</li>
      <li>My hair is frizz free with this stuff in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really light; doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair</li>
      <li>I had literally perfect tamed curling iron curls after my hair air dried from being cut.</li>
      <li>It does control frizz and smooth hair out a bit this way, but it makes my hair almost greasy if I do this.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s an indispensable part of my beauty regimen.</li>
      <li>My first thought - this is a fairly inexpensive  bottle when you realize how much product you are getting.</li>
      <li>When she went to use it on my hair my first thought was \\&quot;okay here</li>
      <li>This product has helped my gargantuan hair greatly.</li>
      <li>On hot and humid or rainy days, my hair still frizzes, but this does help a lot and makes it more manageable.</li>
      <li>Great for using to blow dry curly hair.</li>
      <li>their Catwalk Fashionista Smooth n Shine but have yet to find one that I love as much.</li>
      <li>I apply it while it&#x27;s wet/amp and comb it in, making sure I apply enough on the ends and when it dries and I straighten my hair, it looks amazing.</li>
      <li>I have thick and wavy hair, and I wasn&#x27;t looking for a straightener, but this is perfect for my wash and go routine in the morning.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy and it leaves your curls nice and soft.</li>
      <li>The much cheaper Ampro worked way better than Bed Head.  </li>
      <li>:) and it really helps with frizz.</li>
      <li>Absolutely great, I have long thin hair and this product is perfect for those who suffer from frizz.</li>
      <li>I have super frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>This particular product is what pushed me from hating my curly hair to embracing and enjoying it.</li>
      <li>This product tamed my frizzy and my hair felt smooth and straight!</li>
      <li>Decided to try it again 10 years later and am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>My hair is very thick and curly and this stuff works awesome holding my hair in place.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, dry, curly hair that frizzes easily.  </li>
      <li>Really helps keep curls smooth yet flexible.</li>
      <li>For as much as you pay, it really is a bargain and is so much better than products you find at a department store.  </li>
      <li>As a result, it&#x27;s worth the subscription offered on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Had purchase a bottle some years ago and it seemed to last for ever and did a great job on my old tired hair and was happy to find it on line !&lt;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband and I both use this product and love it. We live in Hawaii and it&#x27;s humid a lot so this really really helps.</li>
    <li> My hair is tough and after trying just everything out in market this one worked.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite frizz control hair product! I have very unruly \\&quot;wings\\&quot; on both sides of my temporal hairline, and this product works wonders on them!</li>
    <li> Product is ok not sellers fault</li>
    <li> Love it - use all the time</li>
    <li> The serum controls hair, gives it body and prevents it from being fly away</li>
    <li> This product has great hold and will reduce the frizzy hair look if you have a problem with that - as I do.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it tends to make your hair look wet, and if you wait for it to dry you can break your hair out of that look.</li>
    <li> This serum is an essential part of my hair routine. I have very fine, wavy and frizzy hair that I used to have to straighten daily. Using this serum, I don&#x27;t have to use the straightener -- just using the hair dryer I can straighten my hair without damaging it. It is a bit sticky, as in, if you touch your hair all day then your hands will get sticky. Other than that, this stuff gives me super smooth and shiny hair that looks healthy and it&#x27;s the best humidity-resistant serum I&#x27;ve ever used -- and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the years. Along with the Tigi Strong Mousse, I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: To everyone who says this product makes their hair look dirty or flaky: You&#x27;re NOT supposed to put the serum on your roots! That seems obvious to me, but it sounds like everyone who gave this a poor review put the product on their roots. Evenly distribute the product through the ends of the hair while wet, then blow dry straight with a paddle brush. Easy enough. This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> I use this serum with the shampoo and conditioner. I think the serum makes the difference however. When I apply it to my hair once its dry, I notice very little difference. When I apply it after I shampoo and wash my hair, I notice a HUGE difference. I have very long thick hair. I apply it while it&#x27;s wet/amp and comb it in, making sure I apply enough on the ends and when it dries and I straighten my hair, it looks amazing. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love to use this when I get out of the shower on damp hair and I let my hair air dry.  Generally my hair gets sooo puffy I sometimes look like i have a lion&#x27;s mane!! However, once I started using this that was absolutely decreased!  It makes my hair much less frizzing and sooo much easier to straighten!</li>
    <li> I really like what this does for my hair.  I have thick and wavy hair, and I wasn&#x27;t looking for a straightener, but this is perfect for my wash and go routine in the morning.  I just put it in my wet hair and it prevents frizz, and my hair dries nice, still wavy, but not fluffy (if that makes any sense).  I&#x27;m sure that if I actually blow-dried my hair, this stuff would work great.</li>
    <li> I have unpredictable, medium thick, curly/wavy hair with a bit of kink to it and this is the only stuff that feels completely non-sticky and weightless but still controls the frizz and makes my hair more manageable. Put it on wet and blow dry and it feels like you didn&#x27;t use any product but your hair is much more controlled. I think the negative reviews are coming from people who either put it on wet hair and don&#x27;t blow dry it or else put it on dry hair, neither of which are the best use for this product.</li>
    <li> My hair became completely dry and brittle after using this. I love other bed head products I have but this was horrible for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff...holds nicely but not stiff. I use a little on towel-dried hair and let it air dry -- my waves get fabulous-looking.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great, I have long thin hair and this product is perfect for those who suffer from frizz. Works great for lightly slicking back a man bun as well.</li>
    <li> I got this way back in... about... 2003... around there.... and have used it ever since.  This is absolutely mandatory in the summer because I love to spend a lot of time outdoors, where it&#x27;s humid or wet or I&#x27;m sweating.  My hair is frizz free with this stuff in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of a sticky, runny gel with sparkles!  It works best right after a shower - it&#x27;s better at PREVENTING frizz than removing frizz.  After towel drying my hair, I run this through with my fingers making sure to get the ends (it only takes about a nickel-size amount to cover my hair and my hair is long).  This works especially well with blow-drying, I don&#x27;t get those really annoying little flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whole bottle will last you a looooong time.  For as much as you pay, it really is a bargain and is so much better than products you find at a department store.  It leaves no leftover smell and it&#x27;s really light; doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty medium hair as in it&#x27;s not too dry nor is it too oily. It&#x27;s naturally a bit wavy.  This might not work for all hair-types, but make sure to check the whole bed head line if you&#x27;re not sure!  They have specific stuff for curls and flat hair etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be great for any type of hair though.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with the correlating shampoo and conditioner, but by itself it is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the sparkles in it don&#x27;t show in your hair so don&#x27;t worry about looking like a glitter magnet.</li>
    <li> Feels kind of slickery gross but absorbs into hair very well. I&#x27;ve used this about 6 or 7 years and haven&#x27;t been able to give it up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for years and absolutely love it. It keeps my hair frizz free as I have curley thick hair especially when I straighten it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was just what I expected.  The value of this product made the purchase worth getting it online instead of in a store.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really helps to style and hold my naturally wavy hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and this is one product I make sure not to give out of.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that I dye red; there were times when I looked like Larry from the Three Stooges because nothing controlled the frizz.  So now I use Control Freak and it&#x27;s great!  I apply to damp hair, comb it through, and I can either let it dry on its own or blow dry it.  Control Freak leaves some of the wave in but keeps the frizz at bay, which is especially helpful when going for a 1920s, 1930s, or 1940s hairstyle, and using a three barrel curling iron will give my hair marcel-style waves without having to perm it.  To go completely straight, use the blow dryer and flat iron if necessary.  I had to try a few times to get the amount to use right, but since I did so, it&#x27;s worked well.  It softens my hair and controls it without obvious residue or stiffness. The Amazon price is less than half of what the local stores charge.</li>
    <li> This product smells OK, but that&#x27;s where the good part ends for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy, long hair, and this product did nothing for my hair. After towel-drying, I put a small amount in my hair, and blow-dried. However, I did not notice any difference in the way my hair felt or looked. I did notice my hair getting oily after only a few hours.</li>
    <li> One of my fave Bed Head products. Works great when you apply before blow drying. Helps hair dry much straighter. Saves time and damage with the flat iron.</li>
    <li> Have used for years on mine and my daughters naturally curly hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> The price is really a good bargain The product is very good I been used this for years I recommend to people with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. On time delivery for Amazon Prime Members.</li>
    <li> This is what I&#x27;ve used on my cowlick for years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s half the price of the local beauty shop. Good buy!</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy hair, and this product keeps out the frizz and gives me touchable hair that still keeps it&#x27;s shape. I didn&#x27;t get any flaking or stickiness. Maybe the stuff flakes when you use a flat iron with it or when you&#x27;ve put some other product on your hair first?</li>
    <li> no real extra shine...dries my hair out so will not continue to use</li>
    <li> I layer it on after my leave-in conditioner and among the millions of products I&#x27;ve tried it&#x27;s one of the best frizz fighters.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair is so frizzy and in tammed. This did nothing at all for it!! All it did was goo up my hair and weigh it down!!! 😒</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the local grocers for $18 along with another brown gel called Ampro of which I paid $2.19.  The much cheaper Ampro worked way better than Bed Head.  Bed Head flaked like crazy.  I have dark hair, and Bed Head made it look like I had a lot of flaky dandruff in my head.  I will call the grocer today to see if I can get my $18 back.</li>
    <li> Really gives my hair texture.  Recommended by my hairdresser and it really has made a very big difference.  As a result, it&#x27;s worth the subscription offered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I did try using this, and used it according to the directions but it did not work for me. Even as I was straightening my hair, it was still dry and it didn&#x27;t really do anything for the end pf my hair. I can see the product works for a lot of people apparently, but I myself wouldn&#x27;t try it again. I would still support the product, but I myself will stick it my Ion spray for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Notes:&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t have a bad or good smell.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s VERY greasy on your hands. Each time I rubbed it in my hair I rinsed my hands tgo get ready for the next round.</li>
    <li> Great for using to blow dry curly hair.</li>
    <li> This was the first Bed Head product I tried and it didn&#x27;t live up to my standards. I have wavy hair and all it did was make my hair look like it needs washed. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s versatile.  I have naturally curly hair so it works well if I allow my hair to dry naturally or if I decide to blow dry it straight.</li>
    <li> Definitely tames my frizz for awhile. It has a bit of a funny smell I guess but nothing too bad.</li>
    <li> I have used Bed Head for a few years and I haven&#x27;t found anything that tames my frizz as well as this product. I shopped around and found this to be the best price at the time.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel there is. I have been using it for years and was really happy to get such a good price.</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel soft and looks healthier. :) and it really helps with frizz. ive bought bed head for year and wont go back to anything else</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever for frizz and taming those flyaways I use it right after I get out of the shower while my hair is drying and also while pulling it back</li>
    <li> leaves my hair feeling strange,,,but it does work pretty good.</li>
    <li> Good item.  Have used it for years and works well.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and curly and this stuff works awesome holding my hair in place.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for my fine hair--control and shine--great product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, any time.</li>
    <li> I love this jell for my hair, have used it for many years.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick, curly hair and I tried so many different hair products that really didn&#x27;t alleviate the frizziness, but I tried this and it worked wonders!  She&#x27;s been using it for four years and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!  I don&#x27;t like their other products as well, but this gel is fantastic!  Also, the price on Amazon is about half what you pay at the drugstore, grocery store, or big box store.</li>
    <li> Love this for my natural curl. Gets rid of the frizz and leaves it normal feeling once my hair dries (not greasy/sticky)</li>
    <li> Yes, yes, frizzy hair, blah, blah, blah. I feel like when I start each beauty review that has to do with hair I state that I am a frizz-ball. A new product I have tried recently is from the Bed Head line. A girlfriend uses many of these products and swears by them, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. I picked up the Control Freak serum. My first thought - this is a fairly inexpensive  bottle when you realize how much product you are getting. I have been using this a few times a week for about two months now, and it looks like I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it. My second thought - I really like this serum. It works best for me straight out of the shower and before I blow dry. The frizz is decreased and my hair is shiny, which is clearly fab. I&#x27;ve tried this before on dry hair (as instructions say can use on wet or dry hair) and the result is not as fab. It mostly just feels like glop in my hair and does not look good at all. This is one I would recommend for wet hair - and I like the smell too!</li>
    <li> I have super frizzy hair. If I don&#x27;t flat iron every day, the Florida humidity makes me a total frizz ball. This actually tames the frizz. It&#x27;s the only product of the hundreds I&#x27;ve tried that actually works.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product to manage those curls, especially on natural 4c hair, this is your go to.</li>
    <li> This product is helpful for when I need to tame my natural wavy hair, or keep my straightened hair from frizzing. I apply it right as before I leave the house and it makes my hair look so much better. I have thick hair and I only use a dime-sized amount each time and it works perfectly. I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for the past 5 years and I use it frequently, so I&#x27;m definitely getting my use out of the $11 bottle! I would definitely recommend this serum!</li>
    <li> Best product for my naturally curly hair!</li>
    <li> Great price for this item.  Works well.</li>
    <li> My daughter swears by it!!</li>
    <li> I do love me some Toni &amp; Guy products. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for their Catwalk Fashionista Smooth n Shine but have yet to find one that I love as much. Control Freak works great for smoothing but doesn&#x27;t really give me the \\&quot;umph\\&quot; I&#x27;m looking for in shine. I will always have it on hand though, at least until I can find a suitable replacement.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, dry, curly hair that frizzes easily.  For years I HATED my curly hair because all it ever did was frizz, especially around my face.  I tried using several other frizz control products, and many of them did help.  I found this product in 2004. This particular product is what pushed me from hating my curly hair to embracing and enjoying it. Once i began using this product, I started getting compliments on my hair, regularly.  I could write epic depressing novels on all of the horrible comments I got from people up until the point I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;It controls my frizz, in almost every type of weather.&lt;br /&gt;It smooths out my hair making it easier to comb, brush and style.&lt;br /&gt;It provides a nice glossy finish.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t heavily scented, and the little sparkles in the bottle don&#x27;t show up in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;A few other products have come along in the last few years that work well for me, but I still keep coming back to this one.  It still works that well for me.  All curly hair is a little different, but this one is a must to try if you are looking to control your curly frizz.</li>
    <li> Helps hair from the frizzies</li>
    <li> This product is good to remove flyaways and had control to your hair but because of the sparkles inside it, it&#x27;s a 1 star. If they could sell this without the sparkles in it, I will use it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can use it to shape my tight curls into looser ones.  I do so by dividing my hair into six sections, applying the serum to a section (dime sized amount), and then twisting the section around two fingers from end to root.  I carefully unwind it and let it air dry.  It&#x27;s very pretty, and I will sometimes use a little extra on the ends to keep them under control.  I love the scent, and my hair does not feel crunchy or flake.</li>
    <li> This product seriously blew my mind! I went to the hair dresser to get my hair cut and the lady that did my hair used this product. Now from being in beauty school I know that hair dressers are suppose to use products in their hair so that they can recommend that product to you so that you will buy it and make more money for the salon. But they always tend to be super expensive over rated duds that you blow your money on simply because a professional told you to buy it. Not this one! This product is literally so amazing. When she went to use it on my hair my first thought was \\&quot;okay here we go she is gonna recommend this really expensive product and tell me how it will do wonders for my hair blah blah blah.\\&quot; The first thing that hit me was the smell and in one word the smell is simply this. Delicious. I had told her my hair type was naturally a big fizz of curl but that it had a wavy texture to it and she immediately pulled this out. My hair was just DAMP not wet! I wouldn&#x27;t suggest to use it on completely wet hair. So she ran it all their my hair and said that it will calm down your frizzy and help tame the curl in my hair and that I could even straighten my hair if I wanted with this product. I thought oh okay maybe it will work but I have pretty thick hair so I didn&#x27;t expect much especially from a product you could find at your local Wal-Mart. Let&#x27;s just say I was FLOORED when I got home! My hair looked amazing! It looked as if I had just curled my hair with a curling wand and I just let it air dry! I had literally perfect tamed curling iron curls after my hair air dried from being cut. I literally did nothing to my hair but walk out of the salon. I am a avid hair straightener user and wanted to straighten my hair when I got home from the salon to check out my new hair cut but took one look in the mirror and was stunned by how beautiful my hair looked! I couldnt stop admiring how perfect my curls were! Hands down best product for curly hair girls! Odered this literally right after I looked in the mirror. 5 stars hands down!rally right after I looked in the mirror. 5 stars hands down!</li>
    <li> Hate gummy gel. Lots are. Enjoy the fresh, non-sticky quality of Bedhead!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps down frizziness without the helmet head.&lt;br /&gt;Yay!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;After I started using this product I can not use another.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks great.</li>
    <li> I have used this every day (about a tablespoon) after my shower for a month and can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;ve put anything on my hair.  It does not help with curl, fullness or frizz at all that I can see. A simple gel did more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it on my curly hair before diffusing, so it&#x27;s not just for straightening! Really helps keep curls smooth yet flexible.</li>
    <li> As some other reviewers have stated, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting this in your hair dry. It does control frizz and smooth hair out a bit this way, but it makes my hair almost greasy if I do this. I put it in my hair wet and dry it. Completely different results. My hair is still extremely soft, smoother, and with less frizz. It doesn&#x27;t look or feel like there&#x27;s product or grease in it. On hot and humid or rainy days, my hair still frizzes, but this does help a lot and makes it more manageable.</li>
    <li> This is a good, reliable hair product for controlling frizz. It has a pretty neutral smell. It is not very natural. It works, but I think for the price there are better products.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this product</li>
    <li> This product has helped my gargantuan hair greatly. It&#x27;s too long to wash every day, and while it has lovely curls on hair washing day, I still need to leave the house in between these hour long time suckers. I just use a small amount of this, work it in, and crimp with my fingers. Looks almost as good as it did on washing day.</li>
    <li> I use this every few days when I straighten my hair with the blow dryer.  I have really thick, curly, course hair and this helps make it straight and takes out the frizz.  It also makes my hair really soft.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have never found a product I like as much.  Just don&#x27;t use too much or it will weigh your hair down and blow drying will take hours.</li>
    <li> Puts a little bit of shine in my hair but still lets it curl once it dries. Doesnt feel or look greasy at all</li>
    <li> works pretty good reducing frizz…..</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS! I have frizzy wavy thick hair. This product tamed my frizzy and my hair felt smooth and straight! I loved this so much I bought some for my daughter. ..she&#x27;s lives it to!</li>
    <li> I know this product is supposed to be for straight hair, but I use it for my really thick naturally curly hair as a frizz tamer and I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy and it leaves your curls nice and soft. I put this in and let my hair dry naturally.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of curly/wavy/fine hair. This stuff legit provides a shield against humidity. I put it on my damp hair before blow drying then proceed to flat iron with a serum. This stuff definitely helps reduce frizz! The smell brings back memories of when I used it when I was younger. Decided to try it again 10 years later and am so glad I did! Good product for an awesome price!</li>
    <li> Had purchase a bottle some years ago and it seemed to last for ever and did a great job on my old tired hair and was happy to find it on line !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !!!!</li>
    <li> It exploed so I couldn&#x27;t use it but they refunded me so I gave them 2 stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on nearly a daily basis since the late 90s -- no kidding! I have fairly fine, wavy long hair and this stuff works great for me, smoothes my hair and keeps frizz down. I work through a quarter-sized dollop when my hair is damp and then blow it out. If my hair does curl due to humidity or getting wet, it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy and still looks styled. Its worked so well for me I didn&#x27;t try many other products, but the ones I did were heavier, or greasy, or seemed to attract moisture. It&#x27;s not perfect (nothing is!) but I honestly love this stuff and it&#x27;s an indispensable part of my beauty regimen.</li>
