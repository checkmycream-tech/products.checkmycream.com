### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Probably the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard this is best rubbed evenly all over your face,</li>
      <li>It works perfectly at reducing, almost eliminating redness.</li>
      <li>Great product, will continue to use!</li>
      <li>Looks great and feels great!</li>
      <li>This is a great product, I haven&#x27;t worn any makeup all summer, I just use this and it looks like I have makeup on.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great if you know how to use it.</li>
      <li>Great Job at getting rid of redness.</li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied and very happy with this cream!</li>
      <li>It is a good product</li>
      <li>My complexion is really fair</li>
      <li>you are fair, skip this.</li>
      <li>Avoid if you are fair skinned.  </li>
      <li>Like I said, I did put too much in, tried to rub it in the best I could and even wiped some off my face, and also it might not have looked so cakey if I had used a brush for coverage.</li>
      <li>It has just the right amount of coverage, is nice and light weight, and turns a perfect shade on my skin.</li>
      <li>Great product and it arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>The Loreal is near perfect!</li>
      <li>Would not recommend for very light (ivory like) skin tones.  </li>
      <li>I have more of a light olive complexion but it works nicely for me.</li>
      <li>Loreal Magic Anti-Redness</li>
      <li>My skin has yellow undertones which work perfectly with it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I use it as a primer and then put my foundation on top</li>
      <li>Perfect for red blotches and those with rosacea.  </li>
      <li>I have somewhat oily and acne prone teenager skin, so most foundations and BBs just seem to cover my face and look like cake.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>, I almost felt like I didn&#x27;t even need any more make up</li>
      <li>, I thought it was just a BB version, which could be interesting.</li>
      <li>light weight and non greasy.</li>
      <li>I have Rosacea, and have been using another L&#x27;Oreal BB cream with success in controlling the redness, but this works even better.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not something to wear by itself if you&#x27;re light skinned.</li>
      <li>that it feels light on my skin.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and it turned my skin completely Orange.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>I am really excited to find this.  </li>
      <li>The other was a good color, but had a lot more coverage than I want.</li>
      <li>use this BB cream and follow with &amp;#34;Being True transforming skin tint&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I use the fair color of this BB cream, but sometimes has red face due to my allege, so think this one will be good, but the coverage is not as good as Korean brand Natural Republic&#x27;s CC cream or BB cream</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing again, this is a terrific BB cream, and an excellent price for the quality.</li>
      <li>I spend a Good deal of time outside, so I am somewhat medium light but by no means fair, and this was just so far from a natural color.</li>
      <li>This BB cream color is too dark for someone have fair or light skin, I try to blend fair color with this one, the result are better, but really to heavy to use 2 BB cream together.</li>
      <li>is super light and easily blendable to my skin tone (think revlon nude or loreal natural beige).</li>
      <li>The other BB Magic Beautifier Cream in Fair actually works way better than the anti redness cream.</li>
      <li>It DID calm the redness of my rosacea, however, so I found a way to use it:  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re fair or light, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try if you are dealing with blotches or rosacea redness.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen dilutes the BB just enough to lighten it to match my skin tone and still be effective in reducing the redness.  </li>
      <li>For some reason, this product just can&#x27;t come out the right color.</li>
      <li>so when I do get redness, it doesn&#x27;t stick out very much</li>
      <li>That, instead, this yellow foundation was basically disguised as a version of a product I love--</li>
      <li>But anyhooo I followed the directions and applied evenly all over my face which was my first mistake.</li>
      <li>in that I had flashbacks to tween me over applying too-dark foundation for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>I only wish I could find it on subscription so that I could automatically get more.  </li>
      <li>Orange is a warm color that enhances redness, and the green is quickly blended away.</li>
      <li>One other was nice, but had a grayish cast to it.</li>
      <li>I then cover this with a light dusting of Bare Minerals Mineral Veil.  </li>
      <li>But I found that if I use a foundation brush to kind of move it around then it doesn&#x27;t get too dark.</li>
      <li>The product did what it said and DID reduce the redness in certain areas.</li>
      <li>this is amazing, it&#x27;s green when you put it on &amp; it blends to your skin tone.  </li>
      <li>That would&#x27;ve been a help that I&#x27;d have appreciated.</li>
      <li>gives me light but enough coverage</li>
      <li>I really like this anti-redness cream.  </li>
      <li>I am blond and light skinned, didn&#x27;t cover the red, just turned me orange.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really need this product.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product:</li>
      <li>The product boasts that it starts green but turns to a &amp;#34;universal shade&amp;#34; when you apply it, but most people suffering from redness, rosacea, etc are fair skinned or medium at the darkest, but their universal shade is a dark orange-ish tab color, which does nothing to reduce redness.</li>
      <li>The bottle and label look SO MUCH like the green Loreal Magic anti-redness I use</li>
      <li>Just a little concealer on top and my Ben Nye banana powder</li>
      <li>There is no weird green tinting but a light skin tone tint after its blended.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like many others, I was duped into thinking this product was going to be green, like the package.</li>
      <li>If this had been labeled and packaged more accurately, I never would&#x27;ve bought it, knowing it&#x27;s not made for me.</li>
      <li>itchy(I have very sensitive skin)</li>
      <li>Happy that the product did what it was intended to do; however, most green based anti redness will cover up red spots since green is opposite red on the color wheel.</li>
      <li>Just wow, it works!</li>
      <li>I had the same experience as Cottonsue; the cream has far too much pigment for me and looks like a mask.  </li>
      <li>(I put it on anyway because I&#x27;m too self conscious</li>
      <li>Not a green primer.</li>
      <li>and I was completely in awe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The result is a soft, natural look that lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Would have rather it stayed green to even out the redness and use with a light foundation.</li>
      <li>I have some red patches on my cheeks, so it really evens out my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Helps to apply a mineral powder over it that is a bit darker than my natural skin color.  </li>
      <li>This bb cream may actually change my life because something that makes me really self conscious has been fixed.</li>
      <li>so far non greasy my skin doesn&#x27;t feel</li>
      <li>have used foundation since I was a teen because I felt like nothing else could help make my face look better, then I discovered these green primers meant to counter redness</li>
      <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t typically have a lot of redness, and I&#x27;m not fair or super light skinned</li>
      <li>It seriously makes you REALLY tan if you have light skin.</li>
      <li>: when you&#x27;re applying it seems to pick up all the dead skin and make it look SUPER noticeable.</li>
      <li>I love it although I can see how it can be a little dark for some.  </li>
      <li>I am going to investigate different ways to apply this product and next time put it only on spots I need instead of my whole face.</li>
      <li>I bought this product hoping it would reduce some natural red tones and some sunburn on my skin.</li>
      <li>It really takes away the redness from my acne marks, active acne, and rosacea.</li>
      <li>even though like I said, I really only needed it on a certain little spot.</li>

    <li> ITSOK... not quite my shade</li>
    <li> Probably the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried so far non greasy my skin doesn&#x27;t feel itchy(I have very sensitive skin) gives me light but enough coverage</li>
    <li> Perfect for red blotches and those with rosacea.  I love it although I can see how it can be a little dark for some.  Would not recommend for very light (ivory like) skin tones.  I have more of a light olive complexion but it works nicely for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I was duped into thinking this product was going to be green, like the package. The BB cream is grainy and certainly green, when it comes out of the tube, but after rubbing it into my skin, it turned a rather alarming shade of orange. I wouldn&#x27;t call their &amp;#34;universal shade&amp;#34; universal by any means. If you&#x27;re closer to the medium shades, you might want to give it a shot. If you&#x27;re fair or light, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This did nothing to reduce the appearance of redness it actually made me look like a clown. I have fair skin and it turned my skin completely Orange. The other BB Magic Beautifier Cream in Fair actually works way better than the anti redness cream.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be oily and the coverage was not very good.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this anti-redness cream.  I feel like it does counteract the red in my skin tone. I would have given it a 5, except that it seems that it also darkens my skin tone. (I have fairly pale skin).</li>
    <li> For some reason, this product just can&#x27;t come out the right color.</li>
    <li> Awful. Not a green primer. It turns into a medium tan color when you apply it to skin. Horrible. Looks horrible.</li>
    <li> The product boasts that it starts green but turns to a &amp;#34;universal shade&amp;#34; when you apply it, but most people suffering from redness, rosacea, etc are fair skinned or medium at the darkest, but their universal shade is a dark orange-ish tab color, which does nothing to reduce redness. I spend a Good deal of time outside, so I am somewhat medium light but by no means fair, and this was just so far from a natural color. Orange is a warm color that enhances redness, and the green is quickly blended away. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Avoid if you are fair skinned.  This product looks like fake tanner on my face.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  It &amp;#34;corrects&amp;#34; redness by covering it with a terrible fake-tan color.  It was anti-aging, in that I had flashbacks to tween me over applying too-dark foundation for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;If you are fair, skip this.</li>
    <li> I had the same experience as Cottonsue; the cream has far too much pigment for me and looks like a mask.  It DID calm the redness of my rosacea, however, so I found a way to use it:  I put a dab of my Dermatologica sunscreen in my palm, add a very small amount of the BB cream to the sunscreen and mix them well.  The sunscreen dilutes the BB just enough to lighten it to match my skin tone and still be effective in reducing the redness.  I then cover this with a light dusting of Bare Minerals Mineral Veil.  The result is a soft, natural look that lasts all day.  I believe L&#x27;Oreal could lessen the amount of pigment used in this cream and have a very efficient skin-soothing and tone-evening foundation without that heavy made-up look.</li>
    <li> This product has been a miracle for my red toned skin. Combined with a sunscreen and a CC Cream, I&#x27;m set for every morning!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I haven&#x27;t worn any makeup all summer, I just use this and it looks like I have makeup on.</li>
    <li> Wayy too orange for my pale skin and looks cakey, even with primer underneath. I really wanted to like this product:( but it is making me break out very badly. Unfortunate.</li>
    <li> Just got this yesterday afternoon so I added it to my make up routine this morning and I was completely in awe.&lt;br /&gt;I have used foundation since I was a teen because I felt like nothing else could help make my face look better, then I discovered these green primers meant to counter redness and I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and all my redness just disappeared, I almost felt like I didn&#x27;t even need any more make up (I put it on anyway because I&#x27;m too self conscious but that&#x27;s me) and I could not believe it.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a miracle!</li>
    <li> Great product and it arrived quickly.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at either Target or WalMart for $7 something. I had heard a lot about it and wanted to try it for myself. First of all, I don&#x27;t typically have a lot of redness, and I&#x27;m not fair or super light skinned so when I do get redness, it doesn&#x27;t stick out very much so I don&#x27;t really need this product. I will occasionally get redness around a pimple if I continue to mess with it. Another note, I apply all make up with a matte primer in the beginning, and that&#x27;s also what I did with this product. I&#x27;ve heard this is best rubbed evenly all over your face, even though like I said, I really only needed it on a certain little spot. But anyhooo I followed the directions and applied evenly all over my face which was my first mistake. The product is SUPER runny, very annoying because it dripped all over the counter and down my arm. Was only a little thicker than water. I applied it/rubbed in with my fingers. The turnout might be different if you use a foundation or buffer brush to apply or a beauty blender sponge, idk, I will investigate that at another time. I also put too much on :/ haha beware a little goes a long way! The product did what it said and DID reduce the redness in certain areas. But after I finished my make up and set it, it looked awful and VERY caked on. I eventually had enough of the cakey mushy look and cleaned off my face mid day. Like I said, I did put too much in, tried to rub it in the best I could and even wiped some off my face, and also it might not have looked so cakey if I had used a brush for coverage. I am going to investigate different ways to apply this product and next time put it only on spots I need instead of my whole face. Happy that the product did what it was intended to do; however, most green based anti redness will cover up red spots since green is opposite red on the color wheel.</li>
    <li> I am blond and light skinned, didn&#x27;t cover the red, just turned me orange. Bummed.</li>
    <li> This helps to cover redness; it turns from green to tan.  Depending on skin color, it may or may not blend in well.  Helps to apply a mineral powder over it that is a bit darker than my natural skin color.  Definitely worth a try if you are dealing with blotches or rosacea redness.</li>
    <li> I adore this. It really takes away the redness from my acne marks, active acne, and rosacea. I actually don&#x27;t wear any foundation with this. Just a little concealer on top and my Ben Nye banana powder and I&#x27;m done. Looks great and feels great!</li>
    <li> Finally! a product that works without having cake it on.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have some red patches on my cheeks, so it really evens out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> The bottle and label look SO MUCH like the green Loreal Magic anti-redness I use, I thought it was just a BB version, which could be interesting. There is, however, NO indication of the color this stuff will actually turn out to be in a few seconds, and the statement that it &amp;#34;Transforms&amp;#34; is smaller than anything else on the completely mint green bottle. Why they&#x27;d think I want to buy a specific color correction then have it CHANGE is beyond me, but there is no such thing as the &amp;#34;Universal&amp;#34; color they mention in the small print either. On my pale skin, the yellowy color looks like the messy lining of a baby&#x27;s diaper. If this had been labeled and packaged more accurately, I never would&#x27;ve bought it, knowing it&#x27;s not made for me. That would&#x27;ve been a help that I&#x27;d have appreciated. That, instead, this yellow foundation was basically disguised as a version of a product I love--Loreal Magic Anti-Redness Correcting Primer, YAY!-- really made me angry. I felt duped.</li>
    <li> Great Job at getting rid of redness. Leaves my skin even tone.&lt;br /&gt;very light weight and non greasy.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied and very happy with this cream! I normally buy a far more expensive brand, and purchased a few other inexpensive BBs just to see what I could find. One other was nice, but had a grayish cast to it. The other was a good color, but had a lot more coverage than I want. The Loreal is near perfect! It has just the right amount of coverage, is nice and light weight, and turns a perfect shade on my skin. My skin has yellow undertones which work perfectly with it. It did not discolor (like turn orange) all day, even after I worked hard out in the hard and perspired. I will definitely be purchasing again, this is a terrific BB cream, and an excellent price for the quality.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and it gets rid of my redness, but it basically does it by tanning your skin evenly between the red and your skin. It seriously makes you REALLY tan if you have light skin. It is a good product but it&#x27;s not something to wear by itself if you&#x27;re light skinned. I use it as a primer and then put my foundation on top and then my powder.</li>
    <li> The green turns into a &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; shade and on my Fair/Light skin it turned almost orange. Would have rather it stayed green to even out the redness and use with a light foundation.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you know how to use it. I would never put it on and go! Apply it only to the red areas. It changes from green to sort of an orangy color totally covering the redness but you need to apply foundation or skin tint afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I use this BB cream and follow with &amp;#34;Being True transforming skin tint&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The only product that I&#x27;ve found that works to cover my rosacea. My complexion is really fair and if I rub in the bb cream it is way too dark and orange-y. But I found that if I use a foundation brush to kind of move it around then it doesn&#x27;t get too dark. I have never worn foundation because it doesn&#x27;t really cover the redness and then actually makes the problem worse. This bb cream may actually change my life because something that makes me really self conscious has been fixed.</li>
    <li> OMG....I am really excited to find this.  I have Rosacea, and have been using another L&#x27;Oreal BB cream with success in controlling the redness, but this works even better.  I only wish I could find it on subscription so that I could automatically get more.  Just wow, it works!</li>
    <li> Thought it would be a creme, its just green water.  Never again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would reduce some natural red tones and some sunburn on my skin. It works perfectly at reducing, almost eliminating redness. I have somewhat oily and acne prone teenager skin, so most foundations and BBs just seem to cover my face and look like cake.&lt;br /&gt;This is super light and easily blendable to my skin tone (think revlon nude or loreal natural beige). There is no weird green tinting but a light skin tone tint after its blended.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: when you&#x27;re applying it seems to pick up all the dead skin and make it look SUPER noticeable. I suggest using a face wipe or washing your face before applying.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> I use the fair color of this BB cream, but sometimes has red face due to my allege, so think this one will be good, but the coverage is not as good as Korean brand Natural Republic&#x27;s CC cream or BB cream my friends have. This BB cream color is too dark for someone have fair or light skin, I try to blend fair color with this one, the result are better, but really to heavy to use 2 BB cream together.</li>
    <li> this is amazing, it&#x27;s green when you put it on &amp; it blends to your skin tone.  I like that it feels light on my skin.</li>
