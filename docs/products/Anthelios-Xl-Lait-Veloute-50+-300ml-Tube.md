### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful stuff!</li>
      <li>My dermatologist told me that these sunblocks are the best.</li>
      <li>Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Probably best for the body.</li>
      <li>Great stuff!  </li>
      <li>But this one you just forget it&#x27;s there, very nice!</li>
      <li>I have allergies to the sun &amp; wind, so this helps greatly.</li>
      <li>Great to find it on line.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product to prevent sun burn on the face.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy and offer great protection.&lt;br</li>
      <li>One of the best you can buy and you can&#x27;t find it in US stores because the FDA is dragging their feet on approving newer, better sunblocks.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Really works well, provides good coverage,</li>
      <li>Good protection for your face.</li>
      <li>(bonus - nice stamps for the kids to collect).  </li>
      <li>By far the best sunblock I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this brand for years and there is nothing better for the face.</li>
      <li>HUGE size, this will give me several months of excellent protection.</li>
      <li>This makes application easy and appealing.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, simply the best chemically-based full spectrum photostable sunscreen today.</li>
      <li>Shipping was much quicker than anticipated and arrived in good condition.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not as easy to apply and leaves a noticeable pallor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and works well.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly for a long time, even at high altitudes with more UV (I use it when paragliding), and most surprisingly it&#x27;s COMPLETELY NON-GREASY.</li>
      <li>I have been rash free all summer for the first time in over 5 years!</li>
      <li>This is specially true when compared to most U.S. sunscreens, particularly when it comes to UVA shielding.</li>
      <li>The Anthelios Sunscreen from Parapharmacy Store arrived quickly even though shipped from Greece</li>
      <li>Very large bottle for the price.</li>
      <li>I received doubled the size than what I usually ordered, love it!!</li>
      <li>Very smooth application, not too white.</li>
      <li>Goes on light and clear and STAYS on.</li>
      <li>Ingredients provide a truly broad-spectrum protection because of more stringent European standards.</li>
      <li>The tube I ordered last October (from _Greek Market Goods_) is very large (300 ml) and a good value.</li>
      <li>And I really love the price for such a large quantity.</li>
      <li>but Ill gladly pay a few more bucks for a superior product!</li>
      <li>any case, either the Anthelios (which you can get in the USA) or the Anthelios XL for me offers the utmost protection, is easy to apply, and does not leave the pallor that many of the other brands do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are three important ones acting synergistically and this product has them:</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This particular sunscreen has a PPD of 30 according to the literature inside the packaging.  </li>
      <li>Price was better than at my local drug store and tube of sunscreen was larger too!  </li>
      <li>I was informed by a dermatologist here in the US that Asian and European sunscreens are better for you.</li>
      <li>Had first used when traveling in Italy last year.</li>
      <li>They are not listed in big bold lettering and can only be seen buried in the list of ingredients:</li>
      <li>Its a little pricier than stuff available OTC in America</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is actually the product, I stll got sunburned and the last tube from a different seller worked fine.</li>
      <li>this isn&#x27;t hard to find :)</li>
      <li>Recommend by my dermatologist for my sensitive combination acne prone skin</li>
      <li>got the new Anthelios XL from a company in Poland because, unfortunately, it apparently isn&#x27;t FDA approved yet for the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Totally unacceptable for something like sunscreen, where the expiration date actually matters, and the product is less effective after such a span of time.</li>
      <li>Make sure you order the big 300ml tube...you need to be careful before you hit &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; or you&#x27;ll pay too much for too little.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and is much less &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling than other sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>but, hey, we&#x27;re talking about Cancer and about big old Geezerhood wrinkles after a life in the sun.</li>

<li> but, hey, we&#x27;re talking about Cancer and about big old Geezerhood wrinkles after a life in the sun.</li>
<li> For example, I can feel a Neutrogena at the back of my neck all day long.</li>
<li> Other products that last long and are prespiration-resistant retain a greasy feel that never goes away.</li>
<li> The only other photostable sunscreen I&#x27;d consider is a Titanium Dioxide-based one</li>
<li> other sunscreens today are NOT photostable–they break down and allow UVA (the cancer and wrinkle causing frequency) to deeply penetrate the skin after a half hour or so of sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
<li> This product is significantly less viscous than some of the U.S. mainstream brands.</li>
<li> A hidden gem of a sunblock.</li>
<li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist since it is one of the few found that gives protection from both UVB and UVA.  </li>
<li> Anthelios is a small price to pay.</li>
<li> sunscreens protect against UVB but, unfortunately, people erroneously think they&#x27;re being fully protected because they don&#x27;t burn–not</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist since it is one of the few found that gives protection from both UVB and UVA.  I have allergies to the sun &amp; wind, so this helps greatly. Only when it is made in France will you find the UVA protection as well as the UVB.</li>
    <li> Good protection for your face.</li>
    <li> By far the best sunblock I&#x27;ve ever used. Works perfectly for a long time, even at high altitudes with more UV (I use it when paragliding), and most surprisingly it&#x27;s COMPLETELY NON-GREASY. Other products that last long and are prespiration-resistant retain a greasy feel that never goes away. For example, I can feel a Neutrogena at the back of my neck all day long. But this one you just forget it&#x27;s there, very nice! The tube I ordered last October (from _Greek Market Goods_) is very large (300 ml) and a good value. Its expiration date is January 2017.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people asked about the ingredients. There are three important ones acting synergistically and this product has them: Mexoryl XL, Mexoryl SX, and Tinosorb S. They are not listed in big bold lettering and can only be seen buried in the list of ingredients: DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE (that&#x27;s Mexoryl XL), TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID (that&#x27;s Mexoryl SX), and BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (that&#x27;s Tinosorb S). From what I hear not all Anthelios products have them, so check the ingredients if you want to buy a cream without the &amp;#34;XL&amp;#34; designation.</li>
    <li> I received doubled the size than what I usually ordered, love it!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Have been looking for this type of product which contains ingrediants not in U.S. manufactured sunscreens. Had first used when traveling in Italy last year. Great to find it on line.&lt;br /&gt;Really works well, provides good coverage, no flaking or greasy feel you get with some sunscreens. Does not keave my skin feeling irritated or cause any burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Im a Biker so I spend ALOTof hours in the sun. The only American products that I could ever find that worked also painted me white and only worked for a short period of time. Anthelios WORKS. Goes on light and clear and STAYS on. Its a little pricier than stuff available OTC in America but Ill gladly pay a few more bucks for a superior product!</li>
    <li> This product is significantly less viscous than some of the U.S. mainstream brands. This makes application easy and appealing. Formula is well-absorbed as well. Ingredients provide a truly broad-spectrum protection because of more stringent European standards. This is specially true when compared to most U.S. sunscreens, particularly when it comes to UVA shielding. A must-have for your daily skincare routine. Period.</li>
    <li> This particular sunscreen has a PPD of 30 according to the literature inside the packaging.  It goes on very smooth and is much less &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling than other sunscreens.  I wear this every day and I love it.  I even went snow skiing and my skin looked like I never even stepped outdoors!  Wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I use it everywhere including my face to keep protected from both UVA and UVB.  One of the best you can buy and you can&#x27;t find it in US stores because the FDA is dragging their feet on approving newer, better sunblocks.  Shame on them!  Make sure you order the big 300ml tube...you need to be careful before you hit &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; or you&#x27;ll pay too much for too little.</li>
    <li> Great product to prevent sun burn on the face.  I have been using this brand for years and there is nothing better for the face.</li>
    <li> Very smooth application, not too white. Probably best for the body. Very large bottle for the price. Contains Mexoryl SX AND Mexoryl XL.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me that these sunblocks are the best.</li>
    <li> I have PMLE and this is the only sunscreen that works to stop the rash I get from the sun from developing. I have been rash free all summer for the first time in over 5 years! Shipping was much quicker than anticipated and arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is actually the product, I stll got sunburned and the last tube from a different seller worked fine.</li>
    <li> HUGE size, this will give me several months of excellent protection.</li>
    <li> Recommend by my dermatologist for my sensitive combination acne prone skin and it&#x27;s perfect.  Not greasy and offer great protection.&lt;br /&gt;Am a big fan of la roche-posay</li>
    <li> The product I received expired 8 months before it was sent to me. Totally unacceptable for something like sunscreen, where the expiration date actually matters, and the product is less effective after such a span of time.</li>
    <li> I was informed by a dermatologist here in the US that Asian and European sunscreens are better for you. She suggested I use anthelios but the one made in France. So far so good. And I really love the price for such a large quantity. Thanx to Amazon this isn&#x27;t hard to find :)</li>
    <li> A hidden gem of a sunblock.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, simply the best chemically-based full spectrum photostable sunscreen today. The only other photostable sunscreen I&#x27;d consider is a Titanium Dioxide-based one and it&#x27;s not as easy to apply and leaves a noticeable pallor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most other sunscreens today are NOT photostable–they break down and allow UVA (the cancer and wrinkle causing frequency) to deeply penetrate the skin after a half hour or so of sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All sunscreens protect against UVB but, unfortunately, people erroneously think they&#x27;re being fully protected because they don&#x27;t burn–not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the new Anthelios XL from a company in Poland because, unfortunately, it apparently isn&#x27;t FDA approved yet for the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, either the Anthelios (which you can get in the USA) or the Anthelios XL for me offers the utmost protection, is easy to apply, and does not leave the pallor that many of the other brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than the others but, hey, we&#x27;re talking about Cancer and about big old Geezerhood wrinkles after a life in the sun. Anthelios is a small price to pay.</li>
    <li> I have had melanoma and use this every day when I get out of shower.  It goes on smoothly and works well.</li>
    <li> The Anthelios Sunscreen from Parapharmacy Store arrived quickly even though shipped from Greece (bonus - nice stamps for the kids to collect).  Price was better than at my local drug store and tube of sunscreen was larger too!  Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order again.</li>
