<li> The case is  always slipping off.</li>
<li> My only disappointment is that the white design with the floral print is some sort of sticker, or paper adhered to a clear case, and that has started to peel just a bit, and I haven&#x27;t had it for very long.</li>
<li> but ive used it for less then 2 weeks and its already lifting at the corner waste of money</li>
<li> , I thought it was going to be a hard case but its kinda rubber and a little flexable</li>
<li> I was looking for a case that could bend but still be hard</li>

    <li> Cute case but doesn&#x27;t fit my phone properly which was my fault when I order it.</li>
    <li> Very Cute and stylish. its a slip on gel type case and protects my phone from scratches and dust. Print is beautiful and fits my LG G2 like a glove. The only downside is the fact that it is shipped from Hong Kong so i had to wait about 4 weeks. But for what i paid for the case it was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I love how it was rubber not plastic!!</li>
    <li> This fits my Verizon lg g2 and its cute, but some how i think it got bent or something because it will no longer stay fully secured on my phone. It pops off on the edges. I liked it at first but now not as much and its hard to keep it plugged in with the case on</li>
    <li> came fairly quick and was exactly as pictured!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  It&#x27;s so beautiful.  Slips on the phone easily too.</li>

    <li> Love it. It fits perfect and looks great!</li>
    <li> Love it so much just what I wanted, and I get soo many compliments, thank you</li>
