      <li>I purchased this NutraSonic 9 months ago and loved it-----while</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT</li>
      <li>I really loved the way the brush worked, and how my skin looked and felt after using it.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not as nearly as good as this productis.</li>

      <li>The Nutrasonic is great, but the Clarisonic is WAY better.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with it and have been using it for about two months now.</li>
      <li>thinking of getting in touch with Nutrasonic to let them know how great it is and that they should get their product out there more</li>

      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this from the company in exchange for an honest review.d this to everyone.</li>
      <li>I received this from the company in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>I bought my daughters their own brush</li>
      <li>It kind of massages too.</li>
      <li>After probably 3-4 months it was still working, and once again we were VERY happy with how well it worked in cleaning our faces (we use separate brushes) and making our faces feel soft.  </li>
      <li>I can also tell that lotion absorbs into my skin much more effectively after using the body brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not a happy girl right about now.</li>
      <li>I realize it&#x27;s more important than ever to take good care of my skin</li>
      <li>I felt better ordering what seems to be a superior product knowing that I am protected for a full year if I get a dud.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so powerful and wonderful even at that setting that it takes a greater speed on the Clarisonic to even come close to the first setting on the Nutrasonic.</li>
      <li>I really thought I had made a great decision, choosing the NutraSonic over the Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to write this review having used both and figured that would be helpful for all prospective buyers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and obviously it is a better price.</li>
      <li>I often use my NutraSonic in the shower and love the waterproof aspects of it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>but after it was stolen, she bought the Nutra Sonic and thinks it is a better product</li>
      <li>My skin also seems to better absorb the creams I use.  </li>
      <li>Still use it approx 3x&#x27;s a week and have recommended it to many people I know</li>
      <li>, as I said above, we were very happy with our purchase...</li>
      <li>THOUGHTS: I love it.</li>
      <li>After recently purchasing a Sonicare toothbrush and declaring that it was one of the best purchases we had ever made (never had an electric toothbrush before), I read about sonic face brushes in a news article and decided to give one a try.  </li>
      <li>the most lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read reviews about the Clarsonic and the Nutrasonic and Nutrasonic seemed to get the better reviews.</li>
      <li>I am sooooooo pleased that i bought this.  </li>
      <li>top things off</li>
      <li>It is fun to use and feels so good while washing.  </li>
      <li>I love this face brush.  </li>
      <li>I will be looking for a longer-term, more fulfilling relationship.</li>
      <li>To reduce splatter make sure you lean over the sink more so it mostly falls into the sink.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that my face is already clearing up</li>
      <li>Thicker cleansers work better than foaming ones for splatter.</li>
      <li>and I enjoyed using it about 3 days/week.  </li>
      <li>Opt for a better quality product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m SO glad I got this one.</li>
      <li>I would never travel without protecting the top of the brush.</li>
      <li>PURCHASED THE CLARISONIC AND LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>So I took it back into the shower, dropped it from about 2 feet, and it started working again perfectly.</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE</li>
      <li>You have to make sure you register your unit</li>
      <li>( My sister has owned hers for over 18 months without an issue (she said it still holds a charge for about 5 or more days).</li>
      <li>Wish I would have bought the better product because now I have to replace it and it won&#x27;t be with another Nutrasonic.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I really love this.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my wife and she was very excited to receive</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife and she loved it for the first week or so.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product after reading so many good reviews about how well it cleans your skin, how much cheaper it is than its clarisonic competitor, etc.  </li>
      <li>I actually look forward to putting on foundation now because my skin is so smooth and wonderful now.</li>
      <li>was the most important thing regarding any type of skin care, creams, make-up, anti-aging, etc.  </li>
      <li>I thought I was making an intelligent choice (largely based on the \\&quot;most helpful\\&quot; review right here on Amazon)</li>
      <li>It does a great job of cleansing my sensitive skin and it is helping to reduce my blemishes and fine lines.</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, I was very happy with this product while it still worked.</li>
      <li>- you will learn easily how to work around that and keep it from happening.</li>
      <li>NutraSonic is wonderfully easy to use.  </li>
      <li>That power just gets my face much more clean than the Clarisonic ever does.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and</li>
      <li>and it is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>The brush was working fine for 5 weeks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really thought I had made a great decision, choosing the NutraSonic over the Clarisonic.  I really loved the way the brush worked, and how my skin looked and felt after using it.  Unfortunately, after less than a month, the NutraSonic has completely stopped working.  It won&#x27;t turn on or charge.  So, big fat waste of money.  I guess I&#x27;ll splurge on the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great!  I&#x27;m using it on my face twice a day and really love the results!  I would highly recommend the NutraSonic face brush skin care system.</li>
    <li> Well the reviews that said this thing died and refused to take a charge appear to have been true-at least for me. The question is why should I cared given that it didn&#x27;t seem to perform as advertised. Oh yeah..cause I paid for it!</li>
    <li> I have been in the beauty industry for 10 years.  I was constantly having our clients come in asking for the clarisonic face brush.       I thought to myself \\&quot;  it must be great\\&quot; so I started to research.  I came across the nutrasonic brush.  It has all the same features as the clarisonic pro but instead of $225 it was only $101.  In just one week my skin is smooth the color even and I feel like I look as if I&#x27;m 20 again.  BUY IT TRUST ME!!!</li>
    <li> The product actually worked well, when it worked. I had to recharge it every 2 uses, just washing my face. Can&#x27;t imagine it would last long enough to use the body brush on any other part. Product info claims the charge should last a week. After 3 months, it died. Will no longer charge, no lights on. Should have bought the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I have had mine since I got it for Xmas 2010.  It has now been nearly 18 months and it is still going strong.  All I have done is get replacement brush heads.  I use it at least once to 3 times a week.  I even used it to help with my daughter&#x27;s cradle cap (she was pretty much bald probably would tangle longer hair).  I would purchase it again if/ when it poops out and have recommended it to friends and clients.  (NYS licensed esthetician since 2009)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It is now July 2014 and it still works!  In fact I just used it last night.  Only con is that the replacement brush heads can be difficult to find sometimes.  I have just gotten into the habit of looking for them on amazon and buying them when I see them approx 2x&#x27;s a year instead of waiting until I NEED them and finding out that they are sold out. I still love it, still would not want to be without it, especially because I use Retinol and my skin can get flaky from it, works well for that.  Still use it approx 3x&#x27;s a week and have recommended it to many people I know and I have yet to hear anything but positive feedback from any of them.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine highly recommended the Clarisonic brush to me, but I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much.  After scouring reviews, I decided to give the NutraSonic a try.  I was very pleased with the way my face felt and looked immediately following the first use.  My skin felt very soft, and my pores were noticeably smaller.  I am using the same face wash and toner as I was before my purchase (Proactiv).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 20&#x27;s and am now battling pimples that I never had as a teen.  After beginning to use the NutraSonic, my acne did seem to increase in amount.  However, after a couple of weeks of using it [almost] daily, the pimples and blackheads begin to disappear, leaving my face looking much clearer than before I started to use the product.  I stopped using the brush for awhile, and of course my face slowly resorted back to its old, bumpy, dull look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, it definitely has a tendency to splatter your mirror.  To combat this, I just started using it in the shower instead of at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use the body brush setting and attachment in the shower.  It really leaves my skin looking and feeling much better, especially my legs.  I can also tell that lotion absorbs into my skin much more effectively after using the body brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning the product for about a month, it stopped charging.  When I called NutraLuxe, they said to simply mail it to them, and they will send out a replacement the following day.  I was also relieved to learn that DNA Response, the seller I purchased this through on Amazon, is an authorized dealer.  (Otherwise, I would have been out of luck).  The unit definitely shouldn&#x27;t have died on me so fast, but I am very pleased with the response from customer service.</li>
    <li> Update at the bottom comparing the Mia and Nutrasonic Bella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted a Clarisonic Mia, but I could not justify the cost. I looked at some of the less expensive drugstore ones (like that Olay makes) and after reading reviews decided a sonic brush really is better than just a normal vibrating one. I also was VERY set on a rechargeable rather than one that took batteries. I&#x27;m SO glad I got this one. I love it! I am a real gadget person and if something I routinely do can be improved with a gadget, I go for it, even if it&#x27;s a gimmick. It&#x27;s so fun to wash my face with this little gadget! It kind of massages too. I really love this. I used to be pretty bad about washing my face daily, but now I do. Let me tell you, if you&#x27;re hesitant to jump on the face brush bandwagon, these things are worth every penny. My skin has never been softer or smoother. People comment on how amazing my skin is regularly with adjectives like \\&quot;glow\\&quot; and \\&quot;luminous.\\&quot; Everyone (including me) wants to touch my face because it&#x27;s so soft. I can&#x27;t get over it. I actively need to think \\&quot;don&#x27;t touch your face\\&quot; or I will rub it all day and make myself break out. And yes, I have broken out because now I can&#x27;t stop touching my skin. I know it&#x27;s the rubbing and not the brush because it&#x27;s only on the one part of my face where I can&#x27;t stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry somewhat sensitive skin (redness, not acne) and this does an excellent job of controlling flakies/skin dandruff. I use this with the sensitive brush head with a creamy cleanser and only at night. It took me awhile to get the movement/pressure down. If you press too hard it will hurt and it won&#x27;t clean. You want the brush to barely be on your skin and just do little circles with it. It does make me a little red immediately after using it, but it goes away within 10-15 minutes. I think once a day is more than enough with this. If you have sensitive skin you may even want to only use it every few days. This totally replaces scrubs I think. If you are exfoliating on top of this, you are exfoliating too much! You don&#x27;t want to remove your healthy skin! You need to get in with your fingers to get the small areas, like beside the nostrils. I didn&#x27;t realize I was missing that area with the brush until I started getting a few pimples there. I also go in with fingers to get near my hairline so I don&#x27;t get soap sprayed into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus from this brush is that it really massages your skin, which seems to have firmed it up significantly. It feels a lot firmer to touch than it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does an excellent job of removing makeup you were certain you had cleaned off but didn&#x27;t. The bristles on this always turn the color of my concealer even after using makeup remover prior to washing. My face just feels totally squeaky clean after using this! One important thing, they will dry you out more than normal with the same cleanser (just because it&#x27;s more thorough). So make sure you have a good moisturizer to use after this. I use the Nivea Creme in a blue tub and slather it on until I look like a greaseball, then sleep on it. When I wake up my skin looks fantastic. I don&#x27;t even wash it again, I just put on sunscreen and go. If it&#x27;s summer I&#x27;ll quickly wipe my face with a Yes to Blueberries wipe to get the excess greasies off my forehead and \\&quot;refresh.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things. 1) don&#x27;t put the brush in the charger wet. I don&#x27;t know why since there are no metal contacts, but just don&#x27;t do it. I wipe the brush off with a towel and then let it dry overnight and put it in the charger in the morning when it&#x27;s totally dry. I don&#x27;t know how long it can go without being charged, but I once had mine out of the charger with daily use for 16 days and it didn&#x27;t beep at me to recharge. The battery life is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) unlike the Clarisonic this does not have a layer of bristles that don&#x27;t move, so it does spray a little. Since I normally use this at a sink this can be a problem. To reduce splatter make sure you lean over the sink more so it mostly falls into the sink. When you wet the brush, turn it on in the sink and shake it a little to get excess water off. Thicker cleansers work better than foaming ones for splatter. Even with those precautions my sink is a bit of a mess and I have to wipe off my mirror constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the little travel bag this comes with and the bristle protectors. I hate throwing face products or anything similar straight into a compartment with shoes or something. I would never travel without protecting the top of the brush. I treat this the same way I&#x27;d treat a toothbrush since it&#x27;s going on my face. I wish the bristles from this with antibacterial hand soap once a week, and then wash the soap out with some J&amp;J baby shampoo so it won&#x27;t irritate my face. If you don&#x27;t occasionally wash the brush it will grow lots of bacteria that can break you out and it will smell nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I dropped my brush from shoulder height onto shower tile and it stopped working. I hit on the counter a few times and it buzzed, but still wouldn&#x27;t work. So I took it back into the shower, dropped it from about 2 feet, and it started working again perfectly. If it can get through that, I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s pretty well made. If it stops working because I broke it (my fault, not the brush) I think I will try out the Clarisonic Mia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: I dropped my brush AGAIN and this time it is permanently broken (my fault entirely, I do not blame the brush). I found a Clarisonic Mia for the same price as this one and there is absolutely no comparison between the two. The Nutrasonic is great, but the Clarisonic is WAY better. The Nutrasonic bristles are much stiffer (even on both brush heads being sensitive). The Clarisonic I have to be trying to irritate my skin and the NS I have to be trying hard not to. The brush on the CS is also significantly bigger and the brush simply feels nicer in my hand. And much as I wishthis wasn&#x27;t a factor, the fact that the CS doesn&#x27;t splatter my mirror is an ENORMOUS plus. I didn&#x27;t think it would be so nice, but it really is. It&#x27;s not just the mirror that gets splattered, the counter starts looking disgusting as does the faucet and knobs. It&#x27;s worth the extra money for the CS in my opinion, absolutely. Yes the NS feels a bit more powerful than the CS, but skin is delicate. You don&#x27;t want to over-exfoliate your skin and the NS does do this in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and charged it per instructions.  The next day I used it and it worked great.  I left for several weeks and when I came back started to charge it and the charger wouldn&#x27;t work.  I had gone beyond my period to return it 60 days and had to call Amazon for a refund.  The product is great but the charger is useless and severely flawed.  Kudos to Amazon for their guarantee.</li>
    <li> Excellent skin improvement! If it stops working or acts weird , it needs a charge, it is fully charged when it stops blinking. I have been using this product for 3 months, very pleased with it, I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m getting older- I realize it&#x27;s more important than ever to take good care of my skin so I splurged and purchased the skin care set.&lt;br /&gt;I charged it for 24+ hours, however, in use -  it would turn itself off, and wouldn&#x27;t charge correctly. (and yes- I had it in the cradle properly)&lt;br /&gt;For the few times I did use it- felt good on my skin, and got the circulation going, but I returned it and I&#x27;m just going to use an old fashioned wash cloth instead.</li>
    <li> great sonic facial cleanser brush.&lt;br /&gt;price helped too....&lt;br /&gt;have been using nutra sonic for years.....&lt;br /&gt;really helps my oily T zone.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT MY NUTRASONIC-ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT-HAD ONE SENT TO A FRIEND. HERS BROKE DOWN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, MINE LASTED UNTIL JUST OVER THE \\&quot;RETURN BY\\&quot; DATE. IT&#x27;S A GREAT PRODUCT, BUT NOT IN ANY WAY RELIABLE. TOO BAD. I WAS INFLUENCED BY THE REVIEW OF THE WOMAN WHO PREFERRED THIS PRODUCT OVER HER CLARISONIC. THAT, I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND.&lt;br /&gt;I PURCHASED THE CLARISONIC AND LOVE IT. TRAVELS WELL, HOLDS CHARGE, DOES NOT BREAK DOWN-MY ADVICE IS TO SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY ON THE CLARISONIC, EVEN THOUGH I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT&#x27;S OVER-PRICED.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product and took impeccable care of it-I never overcharged it, as my mom had one that stopped charging. Nutrasonic told her it should not be left in the charging cradle too long or the battery will burn out. I thought it did a great job cleaning my face and I enjoyed using it about 3 days/week.  I purchased mine from Amazon in May 2012 and I guess mine lasted at least longer than some other buyers. If it lasted, I would have given it 4 or even 5 stars, but given it&#x27;s short life span, I am giving it only 2. When I contacted Nutrasonic this is the response I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry you have encountered this issue, unfortunately our warranty is only available for 1 year when its purchased from an authorized retailer. Your unit is past that one year and amazon.com is not an authorized retailer. I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t help you with this matter\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I replied that I would be leaving a negative review on Amazon, the \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; associate replied with a curt \\&quot;You have a good day too.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying a Clarisonic next time.</li>
    <li> My NutraSonic arrived two days ago.  I charged it for more than the specified 24 hours, which seemed like a very long time to charge such a little device.  But hey, it was going to hold the charge for at least 5 days, right?  Not even close.  Although I followed the instructions to the letter, the battery lasted for 1 cleansing, for a total of 2 minutes.  The second time I tried to turn it on, it sputtered to life, beeped a few times as if to reprimand me for waking it out of a deep slumber, and then died.  So, in summary, this product was nice and effective while it lasted, but lasting 2 minutes before needing a recharge is not good enough for me.  I will be looking for a longer-term, more fulfilling relationship.</li>
    <li> The brush was working fine for 5 weeks. When I wanted to use it next time, it did not turn on and did not charge anymore. Dead and useless just after 5 weeks!</li>
    <li> I had it just over a year when it stopped working.  It did make a huge difference by eliminating many pores - really noticeable.  But to have it stop working so soon is unfathomable and inexcusable.</li>
    <li> I love this face brush.  Not only does it clean gently and completely, it also stimulates my older skin.  I have a glow after only two weeks and my skin has a much more dewy look.  It is fun to use and feels so good while washing.  I look forward to washing my face every night!!</li>
    <li> After an initial 24 hour charge, the product worked once. When I tried charging again, it would not hold the charge. Complete dud, complete waste of money, complete joke of a company and of a product. Stay away!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I was very happy with this product while it still worked. It did a great job exfoliating and made my skin cleaner and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and a half and it&#x27;s pretty much fried. :( It started turning on and off on its own a few months ago, and now it won&#x27;t fully charge anymore at all (light never turns green). It still works if I can get it to turn on - which takes 10 minutes of finagling and luck. And then it takes an equal act of god to shut it off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I would have expected it to last longer, and now I&#x27;m hesitant to buy any face brush, really. :/</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading so many good reviews about how well it cleans your skin, how much cheaper it is than its clarisonic competitor, etc.  I was so extremely disappointed.  The first model I received never worked properly, and after about a week it quit working at all!  I received a replacement from the nutrasonic company...after I had to repeatedly contact them for about a month.  Then, when I received the replacement, it quit working after about a week as well.  I can&#x27;t get my money back after buying this product, but I wish I could.  Please don&#x27;t waste $100.00 buying this hunk of junk.</li>
    <li> I ENJOY USING THE PRODUCTS AND HOPE WITH TIME THAT IT WILL DO WHAT THE JOB THAT IT WAS INTENDED. wE ALL NEED TO HAVE \\&quot;FUN\\&quot; WHEN WE WASH OUR FACES AS OR MOM&#x27;S TOLD US TO DO!</li>
    <li> I am sooooooo pleased that i bought this.  Ive had it for 6 months and feel starting out with CLEAN skin was the most important thing regarding any type of skin care, creams, make-up, anti-aging, etc.  Buy extra brushes, they are VERY expensive to purchase later.  I cant write 1 other bad thing except that prior sentance.  Im 51 yrs old, white, female, normal skin.</li>
    <li> I read reviews about the Clarsonic and the Nutrasonic and Nutrasonic seemed to get the better reviews. Based on that I bought mine and have been loving it ever since. It is really helping with my dry skin and other skin problems as well. I love it and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I checked all of the reviews before I decided to purchase this product. I am very pleased with it and have been using it for about two months now. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with the unit and it seems to stay charged for at least a week with no problem. It does a great job of cleansing my sensitive skin and it is helping to reduce my blemishes and fine lines. I would recommend this product to anyone considering to purchase a skin care system.</li>
    <li> After seeing a few reviews stating that this product \\&quot;worked for a few days and then failed\\&quot;, I still made the purchase figuring those were one-off instances.  This was a gift for my wife and she was very excited to receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We carefully followed the charging instructions (charge for at least 24 hours before first use) and six days later, the unit failed to start and when it was placed on the charger, no charging light illuminated.  We left it on the charger for several hours and after that, the unit still does not operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.  Apparently, the failures noted by other reviewers are not one-off&#x27;s, but more the norm.  Don&#x27;t take the chance.  It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my NutraSonic for several months now and I LOVE it!!  I use it daily to cleanse my face and neck and have noticed a wonderful difference in the smooth texture of my skin, and my pores are getting smaller.  My skin also seems to better absorb the creams I use.  The fine lines on this 57 year old face are diminishing and the deeper lines are also getting smaller.  I LOVE that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NutraSonic is wonderfully easy to use.  It holds a charge for several weeks before I have to charge it again. Then I simply charge it overnight and I&#x27;m good to go for another several weeks.  The brushes have also lasted since I purchased it, and still have a lot of life to them. I often use my NutraSonic in the shower and love the waterproof aspects of it.</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a little crazy in that I own both but I got a great deal on each one. I&#x27;m able to write this review having used both and figured that would be helpful for all prospective buyers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the Nutrasonic- hands down winner! I missed it when I switched and just used the Clarisonic. It will spray a little water when you first put it on your face but that&#x27;s ok - you will learn easily how to work around that and keep it from happening. But, it is totally worth that bit of spray. It works so well and I look forward to washing with it every day. No more flaky dry skin that my makeup just made worse. No more embarrassment about walking around with those dead skin cells covered up with foundation - ick. I actually look forward to putting on foundation now because my skin is so smooth and wonderful now. Has a great glow and looks more youthful. (Hate to talk about this but, the blackheads do not occur as much and those that are there just want to come right out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarisonic is much less powerful and when you compare the two brush heads the Nutrasonic has many more bristles. I&#x27;ve owned the Nutrasonic for a few months and I&#x27;m still using the sensitive skin brush on the lowest speed setting. It&#x27;s so powerful and wonderful even at that setting that it takes a greater speed on the Clarisonic to even come close to the first setting on the Nutrasonic. That power just gets my face much more clean than the Clarisonic ever does. I read somewhere that the brush on the Clarisonic was made in a special way so that it doesn&#x27;t give that initial spray of water as I mentioned before. But, I say, who cares? It doesn&#x27;t come close to cleaning my face the way the Nutrasonic does! I actually put the Clarisonic away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been thinking of getting in touch with Nutrasonic to let them know how great it is and that they should get their product out there more - just can&#x27;t stand how Clarisonic is in the stores and it&#x27;s not as nearly as good as this productis. That&#x27;s how much I think it&#x27;s a worthy purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought smaller Nutrasonics for travel because I can&#x27;t live without it. Buy it! It&#x27;s much cheaper than the Clarisonic and worth every penny! Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/2/12 - Wanted to add a few things about the Nutrasonic- it is wonderful for ingrown hairs on your legs! If you are a curly-haired gal like I am you will find this a great thing! I try to use the body brush a few times a week and have noticed that the little bumps are so much better (virtually gone!) and the exfoliation is preventing a lot of them from occurring in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the Nutrasonic gives you a warning that it is going to need charging soon by indicating this a few uses before it runs out. This is very helpful. The Clarisonic seems to simply die when it needs charging and that is frustrating.</li>
    <li> THE UNIT: It&#x27;s 7 1/4\\&quot; long and is very comfortable to hold. With a brush and cover on it, it weighs 7.1 oz. The unit has to be charged for 24 hours before you can use it. I&#x27;ve been using mine for a full month. I use it about twice a week and it&#x27;s still on it&#x27;s initial charge. After it&#x27;s fully charged, you don&#x27;t need to store it on its base. I store the charger, cord and two other brushes inside the little bag that comes with it. I store the hand-held unit in a drawer when I&#x27;m not using it. It comes with a cover to protect the brush from getting mashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRUSHES: It comes with three brushes, two of which are for the face alone: one for sensitive skin, one for normal skin, and a larger one for the body. I prefer the brush that&#x27;s for normal skin. The sensitive skin brush seems to be a little too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAG: This comes with a silver metallic storage bag. It&#x27;s 8\\&quot; W x 6 1/2\\&quot; H x 3 1/8\\&quot; D. There&#x27;s plenty of room&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW IT WORKS: The brush oscillates over 400 times per second. It moves so fast you can&#x27;t really see it moving. It has four speeds: high, low, one just for the body and jitter mode. There&#x27;s not much difference between them so I use them all. I like the jerky motion of the jitter mode so I&#x27;ve been using that one the most lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE IT: When you turn it on it&#x27;s automatically on low speed. You can then choose from three other speeds. You wet your face, add your cleanser to both your face and brush and gently move it around without pressing it into your face. The spinning brush does all the work. Don&#x27;t stand too close to the mirror because suds fly all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY THOUGHTS: I love it. It&#x27;s fun to use and you can see and feel results immediately. You can clean your face quickly, in under one minute, or you can take your time and spend a couple of minutes. It just depends on how sensitive your skin is. When you&#x27;re rinsing your face off by splashing water on it and your hands touch your face, you can feel the smoothness right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone. I have no complaints about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this from the company in exchange for an honest review.d this to everyone. I have no complaints about it.  I received this from the company in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been back and forth for weeks on which to purchase - Nutra Sonic or the Clarisonic. The esthetician that did my last 2 facials recommended the Clarisonic but when I asked my sister (who is also a licensed esthetician but lives on the other side of the country), she recommended the Nutra Sonic. She told me that she had owned the Clarisonic but after it was stolen, she bought the Nutra Sonic and thinks it is a better product and obviously it is a better price. However, when I went to buy it there were a bunch of bad reviews about the unit dying:( My sister has owned hers for over 18 months without an issue (she said it still holds a charge for about 5 or more days). While I have been wavering, I have been trying to research the product as much as I could and what I found out is that Nutra Sonic offers a 1 year warranty on all their products - and it includes units that stop charging or stop working! I imagine you have to buy through an \\&quot;authorized dealer\\&quot; to get the warranty but what you find out with a little bit of research is that the company selling this product through Amazon IS an authorized dealer! I went to their website (buy nutra sonic - no spaces!) and purchased it through there - which links back to AMAZON! I still got to use my free shipping as a prime member and all the protections that Amazon gives buyers are still there! You have to make sure you register your unit though when it comes - the downfall of EVERY warranty. There is a link at the bottom of the dealers page under customer service. I felt better ordering what seems to be a superior product knowing that I am protected for a full year if I get a dud. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I am blown away by the results! I will update my review in a few weeks/month after I have used it for a while.</li>
    <li> I loved the way this product performed - while it still worked - but it died on me after only two weeks.  I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Well, like many other reviewers, I decided to take a gamble, and purchase this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping they replace it or give me a refund, because after a couple of months of use, mine&lt;br /&gt;too stopped working!!!! I hate writing negative reviews, but this is ridiculous!!!&lt;br /&gt;I charged it for the full 24 hours before using, and would put it back on the cradle (properly) seeing&lt;br /&gt;the light blink, until it turned green again, and than would use it, until again, it needed to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;For the first month I had no issues, than toward the end of the second month, it just stopped working properly.&lt;br /&gt;It would turn off while I was using it, wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and finally just stopped charging all together.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing, I will change this review if I get a new brush, that lasts (or a refund, so I can purchase one that works)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a happy girl right about now.</li>
    <li> First order failed within a year. Ordered another one, it also failed within a year. Nutra sonic would not back their warranty because I purchased them thru Anazon. ?????</li>
    <li> After a few days, I liked the results.  But then it started turning itself on in the middle of the night. After 2 weeks, it died completely and won&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
    <li> Four days after my 30 day return window closed this product stopped working and stopped charging.  It remains to be seen if I receive a partial refund.  I was happy with the system but $100 for a month of facial and body cleansing is too high a price to pay.  I&#x27;m purchasing a Clarisonic from Nordstrom.  If the unit or charger ever stop working I know Nordstrom will make it right no matter when. I thought I was making an intelligent choice (largely based on the \\&quot;most helpful\\&quot; review right here on Amazon) but in this case I should have heeded the warnings of the, at this time, 4 other reviewers whose units went kaput within 6 weeks.  As of this writing, that makes 8 customers with decent reviews and 5 who wasted their money.  How much do you like to gamble?</li>
    <li> I purchased this NutraSonic 9 months ago and loved it-----while it was working.  I used it exclusively on my face with the sensitive skin brush. I do not have particularly sensitive skin but found that brush to be more than adequate for exfoliation and cleansing. After a few months, I noticed that my skin appeared smoother, cleaner and absorbed moisturizer better.  I never did get the hang of not spraying cleanser all over the mirror and countertops so used it only in the shower, 3-4 times per week. When charging, the light only came on sporadically but it did fully charge and would last several weeks with my rate of use.  Last week it stopped charging at all, no matter how much I jiggled it in the cradle or wiggled the cord. Sure, it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than the Clarisonic, but, if I have to replace it this quickly, I&#x27;d rather pay more for the Clarisonic, and hope for a longer lasting product, making it less expensive in the long run.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Nutrasonic brush a year ago. Since then, I have liked the product when it works. Unfortunately, I had to use the 1 year warranty twice. Now that the one-year is up, I am left with a product that does not work. Three brushes have worked for few weeks to a couple of months then completely died on me. Usually, after charging, the brush starts working sporadically when it isn&#x27;t even turned on until it dies. Once it is dead, it never works again. I now wish I would have gone with a competitor&#x27;s product because I have not had a consistently working product. Unfortunately, I will not be receiving a refund.</li>
    <li> Broke after 1 month of use. It stopped holding a charge then just dies all together. Do not buy. Get a Clarisonic instead. Don&#x27;t try to save a few bucks, buy the real brush and save yourself the headache. Seriously.</li>
    <li> So, this was a great product.  I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews after I got this because it worked so great for a year of regular use.  Today ... I shut it off and set it down and it turned itself back on.. I turned it off and it didn&#x27;t want to turn off.  I finally got it to turn off and then it started making this high pitch tone... ???  It&#x27;s not like it has batteries that can be removed to make it stop, it wouldn&#x27;t shut off.  I banged it on the counter and it stopped... temporarily...  My son told me it&#x27;s most likely the quartz oscillator (whatever that is).. but it&#x27;s BROKEN.  It won&#x27;t turn back on.  Wish I would have bought the better product because now I have to replace it and it won&#x27;t be with another Nutrasonic.</li>
    <li> This brush quit working after about five weeks, just long enough to not return it.  The brush handle will ABSOLUTELY NOT accept a charge, making it completely useless. The first brush I bought lasted three years, so I bought another thinking it would be worth it for another three years of use.  Costco used to sell these, it doesn&#x27;t anymore, now I know why.  Neither the seller, the manufacturer nor Amazon (A to Z guarantee does not apply) will take responsibility.  BUYER BEWARE!!!  Stick with Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I will never buy here again. Seller doesn&#x27;t stand behind product. Worked only 2 weeks and because it was a Christmas present and I could not possibly know it didn&#x27;t work in the 14 day return time, (bought Nov 23rd, given Dec 25th, worked thru part of January), they will not replace or refund me. Most companies give extra time at Christmas due to gift giving. Will not recommend this company. The manufacturer states they haven&#x27;t produced this product since September 2012.</li>
    <li> I am so sad: I researched this NutraSonic against everything else on the market including the ClairSonic. This was the best product for the money. I received it, charged it for 24 hours, used it once and it crapped out on me and will not charge again. It says it will hold a charge for a week depending on use. The one and only time I was able to use it I was in heaven. My face was so clean it absorbed tons of moisturizer. Before, moisturizer would just sit on my skin and do nothing. I used the body attachment on my extremely dry legs and the same was true, my skin accepted tons of moisturizer and I could wear a dress with smooth moist bare leg. I hope this was a fluke because as soon as I get my refund I will purchase another one just like it. I am sold on the product but am sad that it crapped out the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and upon receipt it sounded like the motor was not quite right.  I took my chances and while in travel status this past week the product will not charge!  It lasted all of 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> This would have been my second NutraSonic Face Brush.  Unfortunately the NutraSonic Face Brush I received was defective, had to be returned and I&#x27;m currently waiting for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought one which is not the exact same one pictured here in TjMaxx on clearance and of course know why now. Is absolutely a piece of JUNK. Will go ahead and invest in a Clarsonic the next time I catch it at a good price.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about this product not working well, but I didnt believe it could be true.  WELL, it was.  I never got more than a few buzzes out of it and I followed the instructions to the letter.  The only reason it gets even one star is because Amazon took it back and I got a full refund.</li>
    <li> The brush works great and gives your skin a nice finish.  The different settings allow you to kick up your cleansing if you want a little deeper clean.  The charging at first did not seem to last more than 3 uses but after being charged a number of times the charge seemed to last for at least 6 uses.  A great product if you are considering a clarsonic but don&#x27;t want to pay the added expense.</li>
    <li> I bought a NutraSonic brush at the end of December 2011.  My wife and I loved it!  After recently purchasing a Sonicare toothbrush and declaring that it was one of the best purchases we had ever made (never had an electric toothbrush before), I read about sonic face brushes in a news article and decided to give one a try.  After researching the two biggest brands (NutraSonic &amp; Clarisonic), I decided on NutraSonic mainly because of the large price difference and seemingly similar reviews - at least at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, as I said above, we were very happy with our purchase... UNTIL it stopped working completely after 1-2 months.  I can&#x27;t remember exactly how long it was.  You&#x27;ll understand soon.  My wife contacted NutraSonic.  They were very nice about it and sent us a replacement unit.  After probably 3-4 months it was still working, and once again we were VERY happy with how well it worked in cleaning our faces (we use separate brushes) and making our faces feel soft.  Given that it was now well past the amount of time that the first one quit, we figured the first one was a fluke and we were good to go.  WRONG!  It quit soon after that.  Now, we&#x27;re starting to see a pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We contacted Nutrasonic again about the unit stopping.  This time they were a little less willing to replace the unit, but did.  By this time it was somewhere around mid-2012. We received the THIRD unit and began to use it, hoping that just perhaps the first TWO units were flukes and that this THIRD unit would work fine for at least a year.  After all, the warranty is for 1 year, and products usually work for at least as long as the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG again!  Just yesterday, 11 months after the initial purchase and about 4-5 months after receiving this THIRD unit, it died.  The unit takes pretty much a full 24 hours to recharge, which in today&#x27;s world of 1-3 hour recharging for anything from shavers to toys, is a long time.  It has consistently taken around 20-24 hours to recharge (the light stops blinking when it is fully charged).  However, I noticed a couple of days ago when I charged it that it stopped blinking at about 12 hours.  Uh-oh, I thought.  Further, we then remembered that we had just recharged it about a week before, maybe less, when it consistently has lasted for 3+ weeks in-between charges.  Sure enough, when my wife used it yesterday it stopped in the middle of her use, but then started back up again. Then when I went to use it myself yesterday - nada, zilch, not a sign of life.  Completely dead.  I then tried recharging it for 24 hours, but even during the recharge it showed absolutely no sign of life - no light blinking, no light at all.  Nothing.  Take it off the charger after a \\&quot;full day of charging\\&quot; and still nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time we decided to not even bother with returning it, but instead decided to go with the new [[ASIN:B008YQ0R9G Clarisonic Aria Sonic Skin Cleansing Kit, White]].  Even though it is more expensive, we would certainly rather have a product that works consistently (it has a 2-year warranty), than one that doesn&#x27;t work.  It is a pain to have to return a product multiple times, and if we DID go back to them again and even if they DID replace it again (they may not this time), it would probably only last for 3-5 more months, and at that point we would have to buy a new one as our 1-year warranty would expire.  Once you start using a face brush, you won&#x27;t want to go back to not using one, much like many other things in life.  So, to have to stop using one while you wait for 1-2 weeks for your new one to arrive is not fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top things off, we just purchased replacement brushes, which of course are useless with Clarisonic.  AND I remember reading a review on Amazon, just before buying them, where one particular user said something to the effect of \\&quot;Don&#x27;t bother buying new/more brushes as the unit won&#x27;t last long enough!\\&quot;  I thought \\&quot;Well, this THIRD unit seems to be lasting longer and I&#x27;m sure will continue to last, so we&#x27;d better go ahead and buy new brushes as our old ones are wearing out.  I guess I should have heeded that review&#x27;s warning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews for it are not after having used it for a year as we have.  If I would have reviewed it after only 1-2 months I would have given it a great review.  Not now after the THIRD unit in 11 months has died!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please heed our warning and DO NOT BUY NutraSonic!!!  Great price!  Does a great job!  But HORRIBLE quality!  Buyer beware!!!  Three times is a definite pattern, not a fluke!</li>
    <li> This product improved my skin condition.  It made it softer and gently exfoliates all the stubborn little dry patches.  I wish this was available when I was in high school because I went through the pimple phase as most teenagers do.  I bought my daughters their own brush and they&#x27;re complection improved.  It taught them good skin care habits and how to properly clean their skin in minimal time which is great for kids and their busy schedules.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Disappointing product. Was great before it died. Would hold charge less and less over time, and found myself having to recharge brush more frequently. I expect a product to break down eventually because manufacturers make them that way...but would at least expect a FEW years. I REALLY HATE THROWING PRODUCTS LIKE THIS AWAY!!! I like being green and this is disgusting to me. Will be purchasing the Clarasonic and give it a try. Rather pay more for hopefully a longer lasting product.</li>
    <li> Nutra Sonic is a very good product. It really does clean my face, and I like the different brush attachments for using in the shower as well. It is easy to use and I like that it can be used without a electric wire so you can use in shower!&lt;br /&gt;Great gift idea too !</li>
    <li> We followed the charging instructions and then used it twice. That&#x27;s right, 2 times. After that the battery died and it would not recharge. We should have believed the other reviews. When it did work we thought it was great.</li>
    <li> im a guy and cant use this every day.  i would prefer something with softer bristles for my face.  even using the soft bristle brush that it comes with is too harsh to use more than 2-3x per week.  also i think there are cheaper alternatives out there.</li>
    <li> This brush looks just like the Clarsonic and worked fairly well when the battery would hold a charge (sometimes did some not, for about six months, after that I had trouble charging it and holding a charge my husband looked at it and realized that water had somehow seeped into where charger plugs in the brush.  It is completey corroded and appears be a safety hazard.  It is the only product I have bought from amazon that the rreviews seemed ok but what TOTALY different from my experience.  This product is an absolute piece of JUNK, spend the extra money and get the Clarsonic which is what I will now have to do.  What a waste of my hard earned money![[ASIN:B002TK78K4 NutraSonic Face Brush Skin Care System Basic Set Blue]] DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> I love it and use it everyday in the shower.  Leaves my face very soft and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Amazon.com from ProTherapy Supplies to replace an identical one that I have ... it quit working and the warranty has expired.  I LOVE the brush -- I use Tazorac on my face and this really removes the flaky skin associated with that product use, in addition to getting my pores really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is with the vendor, ProTherapy Supplies.  They STILL have this product listed as in-stock and available on Amazon.  After I placed my order, I waited two weeks and hadn&#x27;t received my order yet.  I contacted ProTherapy and they said it was out of stock, with no ETA on replenishment from the manufacturer, and they were holding my order open.  They didn&#x27;t even contact me to tell me that, I had to contact THEM.  I consider that to be FALSE ADVERTISING.  Either you have it in stock, or you don&#x27;t.  And if you don&#x27;t, you contact the customer and let them know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reordering this brush from a different vendor.</li>
    <li> Worked absolutely wonderfully until I lost the recharge base unit.  Now the darn thing has been discontinued!!!  Partly my fault for losing it, but what a waste of money for only having it a few months.  Will not buy from them again because who knows what else will be discontinued...</li>
    <li> Well, just like another reviewer,my Nutrasonic face brush stopped charging. I didn&#x27;t have it plugged in for about 2 weeks, plugged it in and now it doesn&#x27;t charge. I wish I could get my money back</li>
    <li> Love the fact that my face is already clearing up and i have only had the product for a month and 3 days. (dont get me wrong, i still have minor breakouts) My first time using it i was awwedd by all the make up i had left behind. i washed my face normally with just my hands. And after i used the brush, and there was makeup all on the brush. I cant believe for all this time ive been leaving that much makeup on my face. (and im not the type to cake on makeup)It definitively helps get my face as clean as possible. AND I LOVE THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I HATE about the brush is that its already becoming defective. After i use it i will turn it off, and about an hour in a half later it will turn on by itself and just sit there and pulse and vibrate until i turn it off.. and it usually happens quite a few times after. Im not sure why it does it but its becoming annoying because when i use it i use it at night before im going to bed, and then all the sudden right when i fall asleep it starts vibrating. I got mad at it and threw it, (i was half asleep) and that helped turn it off. But im not sure WHY its doing it. I thought it was my fault cause i take it in the shower with me and it definitely gets wet, but i know it says it can be submerged in water. So im not sure, maybe i take the screw out of it and let it dry out and make sure i tighten it all the way. If anyone has any suggestions please leave them.</li>
    <li> I had no problem with my brush charging or even holding the charge for a week at a time.  My issue is that the mechanism in the center of the unit that the brush snaps into started disentegrating.  Everytime I change my brush head a little more of the plastic ring breaks off around the center metal piece.  I am not afraid to change my brush head because I just know it will be the last time before the whole thing falls off and the brush won&#x27;t vibrate anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loved it for the first week or so. Then it simply stopped working and she was very disappointed. Opt for a better quality product.</li>
