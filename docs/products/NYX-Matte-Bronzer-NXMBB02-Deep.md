<li> and I was worried to be too dark bcoz</li>
<li> It is superr dark.</li>
<li> so I think this bronzer is kinda orange for me, but just a little bit.</li>
<li> it is very dark pigmented.</li>
<li> I was browsing for matte bronzers a few days ago and came accross</li>
<li> Makes you look few shades darker but its not one of those caked on feeling/looking bronzer.  </li>
<li> I hate the shimmery stuff because it makes you look a little trashy under direct sunlight, a matte finish definitely gives you a classier look than shimmery bronzer would.</li>
<li> Im very pale and this worked for me</li>
<li> but I was wrong..</li>

    <li> New favorite! I&#x27;ve been searching for a good bronzer and this is it! It blends like a dream, doesn&#x27;t make me muddy, and lasts all day. This can be used as a contour and a bronzer. My skin is a pale tan color and deep is a great shade for me. Nyx rocks!!</li>
    <li> I seriously love it.. and I was worried to be too dark bcoz I&#x27;m medium skin tone but I was wrong.. it&#x27;s really good. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it gets too powdery when you swipe the brush in it.</li>
    <li> Love the matte bronzers, and this one is no different.  It is buildable, and blends very well.  I am a matte bronzer girl, shimmer doesn&#x27;t look good on women over 40, in my opinion.  This one is very blendable and smooth.  Would recommend to matte lovers.</li>

    <li> Matte indeed! I&#x27;m Asian with tan skin, and this shade works well for me, it blends right with my skin tone and it looks natural. My boyfriend thought I lost weight on my face because I used this to contour my cheekbone. Haha. So worth the money, definitely recommend.

    <li> This bronzer is by far one of my favorite ever. Makes you look few shades darker but its not one of those caked on feeling/looking bronzer.  Light feeling and application is always even.</li>
    <li> I seen the other reviews about this bronzer being dark. I had already ordered it so I decided to see for myself. THEY WERE RIGHT. It is superr dark. I am Hispanic and have an olive skin tone and it literally looks like i smeared dirt on my face. I would not buy this product again.</li>
