      <li>I have been using this product in conjunction with the shampoo &amp; conditioner which I like very much as well.</li>

      <li>Tried this on towel dried wet hair, as bottle states, and how amazing my hair and scalp now feels!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very, very potent, which means that spraying this on dry hair can result in a greasy mess.</li>

      <li>Will fade to a very very soft scent after about an hour.</li>
      <li>it does not weigh down the curls, it is light weight.</li>
      <li>This oil is light on your hair, so if you are a natural or textured hair and your hair is straighten this will give you moisture wit out holding down your hair.</li>
      <li>My hair literally soaks up a palmful of shampoo and conditioner and it still feels dry and tangled right out of the bath.</li>
      <li>Very painful&amp;#34; sunburn&amp;#34; going on 4 days after I stopped using for only 3 days.</li>

    <li> I have tried using this mist many times to control frizz and dryness. It&#x27;s very, very potent, which means that spraying this on dry hair can result in a greasy mess. Spraying this on damp or wet hair, right after the shower, however — results in beautiful, manageable, non-frizzy hair from heaven. So yeah, it&#x27;s amazing, but only when its powers are used for good, rather than evil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good for my hair.  makes it feel so soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> Great product! ! it made my hair healthier</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is the only thing that keeps my curly hair under control. Without it, I end up with a head of frizz.</li>
    <li> I just love Oraganix coconut oil products. My hair is so soft strong and shiny. I get compliments from hairdressers and random people all the time!</li>
    <li> This is excellent! I am African American with straightened hair.  This oil moisturizers without weighing down my hair.  I also use it on my hair extensions and it stops the hair from tangling without weighing it down.  When I put on my scalp, it stops the itching. It&#x27;s a wonderful investment!</li>
    <li> This works great for my hair. My hair is thinner and tends to get oily on top and dry on the ends. I love this spray very light and makes hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I do like this oil a lot. May be a little strong when first applied. Will fade to a very very soft scent after about an hour. Not greasy and I use this almost every day. The only drawback is it&#x27;s a pump spray bottle. I apply it to wet skin and pat dry. It&#x27;s impossible for me to pump that bottle. So I got a plastic spray gun bottle and put the oil in that. Works great now and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!! This product makes my hair smell wonderful.......</li>
    <li> I love it really smells good and works on all hair even weave</li>
    <li> Ordered this product it came in two days and the item came with free shipping . It smells really good and it&#x27;s light weight just as it stated it would be. I used it for two days and so far so good. Its the liquid form of coconut oil which was exactly what I was looking for. Coconut oil is really good for your hair I&#x27;m going to use it a few days a week for the next 6 months to see if it makes a difference. It&#x27;s great for the ends when they are dry and for after blow drying your hair it lays down the fly always . I use it to slick my hair back in a bun you only need a little bit to add shine using to much of anything will weigh your hair down I love it so far ! After a few month I will post to see if it actually grew my hair ...</li>
    <li> Need too much to make a difference</li>
    <li> My hair feels amazing and looks healthier!</li>
    <li> I received burns on both legs due to this product. Burns equivalent to laying out in the sun during August for hours. With no sunscreen. Has anyone else? Buyer beware. Very painful&amp;#34; sunburn&amp;#34; going on 4 days after I stopped using for only 3 days.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very smooth and silky! My hair was dry and brittle and now this product is starting to condition it ! LOVE It</li>
    <li> I love the smell of coconut but this was too much and the hydrating oil mist did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it leaves my hair super soft!!!! you dont even need to use too much, only a little and it does the job</li>
    <li> I began using this product a few months ago to rid my head of dry hair caused by highlighting and coloring. I apply the stuff after shampooing when my hair is still wet. I always let my hair dry naturally and the product definitely takes all the frizz and dryness away. It also makes my hair super soft. I will say that my hair is still frizzy and dry if I don&#x27;t use the product. I guess you could say my hair is addicted...LOL!  The product is great and I will continue to use as long as I damage my hair by coloring and highlighting. The smell is terrific also.</li>
    <li> It really work, After getting my hair black colored it was extremely dry, it felt like a broom in my head. As soon as I applied just one time next day after getting colored. my hair gained shine and a softness which i love. I was going to cut my hair very short but this product gave back a natural beautiful shine to my hair that made me change my mind.</li>
    <li> This oil mist is okay. I like how it sprays out of the bottle and the smell. The only things I don&#x27;t like is that it is hard to evenly distribute in my hair and that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair but make it smell like coconuts. I am not sure when I run out I will buy more but for now I will continue to use it along with the other coconut milk products in the line.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product twice. And both times...it CRYSTALIZED!!! I am not kidding you. I bought it...returned it because it crystalized...and then thought my sons may have put something in it...but then after I bought the new one, within one day, it crystalized again! Done.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this for people with coarse hair as it dries your hair out making it even more frizzy.</li>
    <li> This oil is light on your hair, so if you are a natural or textured hair and your hair is straighten this will give you moisture wit out holding down your hair.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t use too much or your hair is left feeling VERY greasy. Smells amazing though! I use it, and then wash my hair the next morning.</li>
    <li> best for skin and hair, the more coconut the better! thin  oil great on hair all day, not greasy looking, good product!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do a thing for my curly/wavy coarse and very thick 54-yr old long Caucasian hair.  Still searching for the holy grail of product that gives me soft, defined curls that aren&#x27;t greasy.  And I&#x27;m not saying this product made my hair greasy: it didn&#x27;t.  But when I sprayed it on, my hair swallowed it all, said thank you very much, and then went right along its merry, uncontrollable way.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and as expected.</li>
    <li> Very light, nice sheen.</li>
    <li> good deal and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of real coconut, but this is that fake smelling perfumey coconut scent like in things from Bath and Body Works. It was overpowering and I didn&#x27;t notice any benefits to the look or feel of my hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair very smooth and it doesn&#x27;t over shine. Very nice scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Left my hair shiny but not greasy. It also worked to protect my hair before bleaching it.</li>
    <li> fantastic product i put on right after the shower</li>
    <li> Love this product and the smell. This whole product line is awesome and it makes your hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> Description was accurate. Just as promised. Smells great. Will definitely buy this again. Should come in a larger size option.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell and makes hair look moisturized without looking greasy.</li>
    <li> Makes hair soft and not weighed down and oily. This is perfect for locks and keeping the hair moisturized without heavy grease or oil.</li>
    <li> I used to have itchy scalp even though I always washed my hair, but now I just put a little of the coconut oil and my scalp is happy. No more itching. This product is great!</li>
    <li> LOVE this spray.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet, but I spray it all over my body just before I get out of the shower.  It&#x27;s very light, but moisturizes well and I LOVE the smell.</li>
    <li> Love tjis product for my natural hair maked it so soft and a bit of shine i love for my extentions too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become really invested in my hair care and saw that coconut oil was a great way to reclaim soft and shiny hair. I use this product twice to once a week and it has made a big difference. After my first use there was a dramatic change in look and texture. I was very happy with my product. I do wish the price was lower for the amount they sell. Also I received it in less than a week and it was fully intact with no spills or leaks.</li>
    <li> it helps my curly hair stay curly instead of frizzy and it smells great. it does not weigh down the curls, it is light weight.</li>
    <li> I love this mist...not only does it help my hair look a lot better, but it smells wonderful - and reminds me of Summer, even when it&#x27;s freezing outside!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products ever!!  Eliminates frizz, helps nourish dry hair, smells great and is light weight. Does not weight my hair down at all.</li>
    <li> This is my second order - I have even used this on my face and arms. It absorbs very quickly and the coconut smell reminds me of the beach!</li>
    <li> Hard to find in my local stores. I have really thick, sometimes coarse, natural try-blonde hair. My hair literally soaks up a palmful of shampoo and conditioner and it still feels dry and tangled right out of the bath. Tried this on towel dried wet hair, as bottle states, and how amazing my hair and scalp now feels! Will try OGX Coconut shampoo/conditioner too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing ! I have super curly hair and this makes flat ironing it so easy!! It&#x27;s cheaper at Walmart then on here, but it&#x27;s so worth the money!</li>
    <li> Makes hair incredibly smooth but not greasy</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the shampoo &amp; conditioner which I like very much as well. The smell is amazing and it is very good to tame flyaways and protect hair while styling!</li>
