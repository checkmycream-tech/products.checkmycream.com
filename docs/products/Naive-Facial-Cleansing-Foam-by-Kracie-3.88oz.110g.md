      <li>It really foams!</li>
      <li>Try it, you will be pleased with this facial cleansing foam.</li>
      <li>&quot; but i&#x27;m not to critical in smells, its more the products way to help repair my skin from blemishes</li>

      <li>I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin, ya i got the whole SHABANG, and this product helped me so much!!!, but i wish it will help me with my oil shine face</li>
      <li>I  admit that this foam is very affordable and can be bought pretty much in any oriental market.</li>
      <li>you just need a pea size amount for the whole face, it has helped with the texture of my skin, making it softer and eliminating breakouts</li>
      <li>One thing that might deter you, though, is that it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t remove makeup very well</li>
      <li>cause my skin is very picky at what it likes.  </li>
      <li>I am asian (chinese descent) and I&#x27;m sooo glad I have found this product..</li>
      <li>Since its only 1/5th of the price I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin so the product might work on people with normal skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and I can&#x27;t use just anything.</li>
      <li>No harsh overfragrance during or after washing my face.</li>
      <li>Love the foamy thick lather of this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>A little surely goes a long way.</li>
      <li>It definitely felt more smooth and didn&#x27;t have that heavy film that some products leave behind.  </li>
      <li>Not only did the shipment arrive two days after I ordered it (now that was fast), when I applied it that same night, about 3 days later I started to see an improvement in my face.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it is much better than all the other cleaners I tried, even the most expensive ones.</li>
      <li>I was a little worried at first</li>
      <li>I made the switch to Japanese products to clear my 15 year long struggle with acne</li>

<li> , the aloe is smoothing (I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s meant for normal skin), the peach is moisturizing (for drier skin) and the green tea is for oily skin.</li>
<li> Some tried out my skin and some made me break out like I had been on a week long pizza binge.</li>
<li> (but it&#x27;s not really a concern if you double cleanse with an oil first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Bought this at my local korean store since i have been half-heartedly looking for products with aloevera (was told my tea tree cleanser is simply too harsh for my skin).</li>
<li> You only need a little dab so</li>
<li> However, it dried my skin and caused red spots and severe irritation.</li>
<li> I have bought at least 6 different brands (expensive and cheap) and tried them out for awhile before giving them to my husband to use.</li>
<li> Made it sensitive, red, welted, broken-out, dry, angry skin.</li>
<li> I have tried several face washes this past year</li>
<li> When I first read the reviews on this product I was a little skeptical about it.</li>
<li> It cleans my face  in an average way and it does not irritate my skin.  </li>
<li> Also isn&#x27;t too harsh on the skin.</li>
<li> i guess its just plain messy..</li>
<li> It takes very little to wash your face so you will have the bottle a while.  </li>
<li> Hmmm.. it was alright, i mean it did work.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got sensitive, red, angry skin and this stuff did awful things to it.</li>
<li> During this period my skin got progressively worse.</li>
<li> Was I wrong.</li>
<li> That week my face broke out so bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a gentle foaming and effective cleanser, my face feels clean and smooth feeling after using it, feels clean without feeling dry!</li>
    <li> Found this for the same price locally at a japanese supermarket. It reminded me of the Shisheido Cleansing Foam that I adore.  Since its only 1/5th of the price I figured it was worth a try.  Its fabulous, it doesn&#x27;t rinse off as quickly as the Shisheido, but it cleans just as well.  You only need a little dab so a tube can last along time.  It really foams! My skin feels nice and clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> It works really good. Make your skin clean and smooth. I use the shampoo with the same brand name.</li>
    <li> Just a small dab, rub hands together and you have a wonderful foam facial cleaner that smells good and cleans really well. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price. My husband loves it too! I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> When I first read the reviews on this product I was a little skeptical about it. I figured it to be just another facial product that will work for two weeks and then go flat after that. Was I wrong. Not only did the shipment arrive two days after I ordered it (now that was fast), when I applied it that same night, about 3 days later I started to see an improvement in my face.  It definitely felt more smooth and didn&#x27;t have that heavy film that some products leave behind.  A little surely goes a long way. I use it in the morning and at night.  Try it, you will be pleased with this facial cleansing foam.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me by a friend. I had suffered from acne all of my teenage life . As soon as I started using this product it began to clear my face significantly. I use to cleanse makeup off my face and my face feels clean and fresh and smooth. I would recommened everyone to try this to help with acne.</li>
    <li> I got this face wash a couple of weeks ago and really like it!  I was a little worried at first cause my skin is very picky at what it likes.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems and my face is super clean.  If my face could squeak it would after washing your face with this product. It takes very little to wash your face so you will have the bottle a while.  The price is great and the shipping was super fast!  I am very happy with this face wash!</li>
    <li> Awesome product keeps my face clean and zit free. Also isn&#x27;t too harsh on the skin. This and good face moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be set!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got sensitive, red, angry skin and this stuff did awful things to it. Made it sensitive, red, welted, broken-out, dry, angry skin. Do not want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used it to shave my legs. It still sucked, but it got the job done.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser i have used. i have tried many brands, and by curiosity bought this one to try it out. i never expected it to be this great. you just need a pea size amount for the whole face, it has helped with the texture of my skin, making it softer and eliminating breakouts</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing, it leaves your face feel very clean and soft. It removes all impurities and make up, the only problem is that it hurts my eyes if it gets in them. Other than that, it is much better than all the other cleaners I tried, even the most expensive ones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as any other cleanser I&#x27;ve tried, which is great considering it comes for such a low price</li>
    <li> It cleans my face  in an average way and it does not irritate my skin.  It does not remove pimples though...  It is okay as a non-medicated cleanser.</li>
    <li> Well, i tried this foam and i like it! realy nice. my skin became not so oily and looks better</li>
    <li> 3 days after using this product I woke up to the smoothest and most supple skin on my face in months (if not years). No harsh overfragrance during or after washing my face. clean and fresh faced.. Bought this at my local korean store since i have been half-heartedly looking for products with aloevera (was told my tea tree cleanser is simply too harsh for my skin). I am asian (chinese descent) and I&#x27;m sooo glad I have found this product.. can&#x27;t wait to try the rest of the line!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several face washes this past year and this is the best!! I have bought at least 6 different brands (expensive and cheap) and tried them out for awhile before giving them to my husband to use. My skin is sensitive and I can&#x27;t use just anything. Some tried out my skin and some made me break out like I had been on a week long pizza binge. I went on vacation for a week and forgot to back it.That week my face broke out so bad I was embarrassed whenever I went out (and usually I&#x27;m not so embarrassed about that kind of thing). I love that it foams up nicely and that you only need a tiny bit to get a great lather. It&#x27;s a great price and I expect it to last a long time. Nice smell too!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t really lather or foam, but it goes on really smoothly (think lotion!). After you wash your face, it feels clean, smooth and soft. It&#x27;s not drying or stripping at all. One thing that might deter you, though, is that it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t remove makeup very well (but it&#x27;s not really a concern if you double cleanse with an oil first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip for buyers! While I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d all work very well no matter what your skin type (I really love this line of cleansers and I&#x27;ve used several with no bad effects), the aloe is smoothing (I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s meant for normal skin), the peach is moisturizing (for drier skin) and the green tea is for oily skin.</li>
    <li> Hmmm.. it was alright, i mean it did work. My skin did feel smoother and clearer, but i don&#x27;t know i guess its just plain messy.. you should use or attach a towel on your body and face so the foam won&#x27;t get on your clothes or maybe put this on naked ^_^...</li>
    <li> Love the foamy thick lather of this cleanser.  This is the same cleanser they use at the Korean spa.</li>
    <li> Extremely gentle, foams nicely without being too harsh, and has a beautiful smell! I love this product! I made the switch to Japanese products to clear my 15 year long struggle with acne and I finally did it.</li>
    <li> Feels good , I kept used this product over 2 years.</li>
    <li> I got this product from the many reviews stating that this product was a very good cleanser, and it was also recommended on Youtube by my favorite makeup and skin channel. I have to say i love the Foam and the smell is overall \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but i&#x27;m not to critical in smells, its more the products way to help repair my skin from blemishes AND THE PRICE IS MY FAVORITE. I have to say it did a GREAT job cleaning my skin and i recommend it. I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin, ya i got the whole SHABANG, and this product helped me so much!!!, but i wish it will help me with my oil shine face, it does not clog my pores&lt;br /&gt;when i put my moisturizer and makeup, i like it more for mornings, but i would say it would be fairly good for mornings and night routines! YAY! I LOVE IT *___*</li>
    <li> I ordered this quite a while ago and I&#x27;m still using it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and a good lotion does the trick for the rest of the day when I&#x27;m finished with the product. It has a nice, soft feel and there isn&#x27;t too strong of a smell. It does take a fair bit of water and a lot of lathering to get actual foam though. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a cream consistency.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on numerous reviews that empahsized a good combination of price and quality. I  admit that this foam is very affordable and can be bought pretty much in any oriental market. However, it dried my skin and caused red spots and severe irritation. I discontinued use after 3 weeks. During this period my skin got progressively worse. I do have sensitive skin so the product might work on people with normal skin.</li>
