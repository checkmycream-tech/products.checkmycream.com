      <li>So far she hasn&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but she has a small one.</li>
      <li>It can really make your dry, droopy old skin look firm and healthy in just a few uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>

    <li> Can&#x27;t say nothing now.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom as she&#x27;s lately been complaining about her skin starting to look less tight. Here&#x27;s her feedback: She does notice some tightening effects, however the smell isn&#x27;t the best, so she uses it mostly on her upper arms. It does seem to be working on her arms so she doesn&#x27;t mind the smell. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I really notice that after a few uses my skin felt firmer, yet still smooth and soft. I doesn&#x27;t feel heavy once applied and the skin is getting hydrated and nutritious by the so many different vitamins and antioxidants that are included in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few of these nutrients are:&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid - hydration for the skin&lt;br /&gt;Propolis - anti inflammatory that reduces irritation, swelling and can act as bactericide.&lt;br /&gt;Royal Jelly - reduces skin aging and keeps the skin hydrated longer&lt;br /&gt;Cocoa Butter - moisturizes and provides natural antioxidant to fight free radicals&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil - hydrates and moisturizes the skin&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea - provides protection against the sun, tones the skin, reduces Psoriasis, reduces Rosacea, and prevents wrinkles on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Avocado Oil - hydrates and adds natural moisturizing fats that keep the skin smooth and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Licorices - helps the skin by treating rashes, psoriasis, itchy skin from things like eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Lemongrass - known to be great for cellulite and folliculitis, as well as a way to ward off any bacteria on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil - repairs scars, marks, dry skin and so much more!

    <li> I love this cream. So nice to apply onto the skin. The consistency is just right. It spreads well. Looking forward to great results. Good products for wrinkles and to improve skin’s appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received the product to try and I am sharing my honest opinion</li>
    <li> this is the best all women should try this to keep from having a turkey  after you good through the change of life everything starts to fall and we all need a little help along the way so I really can say that this is the best that I have found with some other creams but this stuffs works just find I will be ordering me another jar of this soon. thank you so much, I get so many complements about my skin so it is really working and doing a good job at it I am looking,beauitful as ever.</li>
    <li> Have used Reventin for about a month. The product feels great on my skin, but haven&#x27;t noticed a marked change in skin taughtness. Maybe after the second jar . . .</li>
    <li> Was sceptical but it works fairly well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. She is older and loves trying new aging creams. So far she hasn&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but she has a small one. Hopefully after using it longer it will be more noticeable. The cream smells really good. Kind of a minty smell. It rubs into the skin well. I bought these at a discounted price in order to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great product. You will see the results on the third day.</li>
    <li> SMELLS LIKE MENTHOLATUM! NOT GOOD.</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t do anything  for me,  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks ago. Too bad I can&#x27;t  return it  and get my money back.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changed using this product so far.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is one of the best neck cream that i have used. Also the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> Did not see any change</li>
    <li> waste of money...only a moisturizer..firms nothing</li>
    <li> The Reventin Neck Firming Cream is  a wonderful product! My neck looks and  feels so fresh just after using it for a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Increased dermal density and elasticity&lt;br /&gt;Visibly reduced lines and noticeably tighter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in the firmness of my neck.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> When I was first offered this item during a promotion for my honest opinion I was very hesitant, mostly because, well, I had never thought about my neck. it has always been so veiny and ugly I had just given up on  it, it had never occurred to me that I might be what i had or had not been doing for it. So I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly and is very securely closed.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very lite pleasant smell to it. I applied it to my neck before i went to bed the first night and I was impressed with how well it soaked right in without any greasy feeling at all. I didnt notice any difference at all the next morning. Then I applied it again yesterday morning and again last night. When I got out of the shower this morning my husband was staring at me and of course being a man you know I just &amp;#34;knew &amp;#34; what he was  after.&lt;br /&gt;He just didnt know what was different, he couldnt put his finger on why I looked so different.&lt;br /&gt;NOW: I can , cut, curl and dye my hair and this man will not notice!!&lt;br /&gt;He noticed!  I looked in the mirror and sure enough the veins are disappearing!&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if it is this cream in particular or just the fact that I gave it some attention, but I do not care...... I will be purchasing more of this!</li>
    <li> really like it  I can feel the difference</li>
    <li> Great product... love it- Use it every night... lets see results soon.</li>
    <li> Thick hand cream is same thing... i used 4-5 times only</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say whether or not this works. I keep hoping. I have had lots of compliments recently - people wondering what I&#x27;m doing, so maybe it is noticeable to others more than it is to me.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, but did not do much for my turkey neck.  Guess I&#x27;ll just keep doing my exercises.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
    <li> This cream does not firm the neck area. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Okay, really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my neck!</li>
    <li> no way to tell how effective this product was; I didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled, kinda chemical like</li>
    <li> so far it&#x27;s an ok product. don&#x27;t much like the smell. softens neck lines some.</li>
    <li> This cream is so affordable!  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and already see results!</li>
    <li> Simply put, this product does not work. You may as well buy any generic moisterizer from your local drugstore or use coconut oil, which I have found to work much better - and it smells better, too! Save your money.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and I got it well before I expected!!  It has a really nice scent as well!</li>
    <li> Works okay.  But no better than other creams at your local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but I saw no change with any firming. I would be skeptical of the picture.</li>
    <li> Your neck won&#x27;t look like you are 20 yrs. old but it sure makes a difference.  For the two previous ladies - put a sealing cream on top.</li>
    <li> So far so good, awaiting more noticeable results.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t  seen a drastic  change, but do see some improvement!!</li>
    <li> I am trying this...it seems good...I am also using it on the front and back of my neck and chest area.</li>
    <li> I am 76 years old and truly needed HELP.  This cream is wonderful and will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Have bought three so far.  I first looked like a rooster neck now so much better.  REALLY.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Isabel</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT DIDN&#x27;T DO ANYTHINNG TO TIGHTEN THE SKIN ON MY NECK. AND SINCE I CAN&#x27;T GET A REFUND EXCEPT TO SEND THE PRODUCT BACK UNOPENED, I&#x27;M OUT THE MONEY AND NO RESULTS.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy this again....not great...</li>
    <li> NO STAR. CREAM SMELLED LIKE A DEAD ANIMAL. I THINK IT WAS &#x27;ROTTEN&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Been using for over 1 month.</li>
    <li> Well, I have been using it for two months and it has definitely improved my neck. It is firmer and less turkey neck. I would definitely buy it again and it lasts a long time. I haven&#x27;t even used half the jar. It was a great price and lasts long and works on firming the neck area.</li>
    <li> I find it to have firmed up the skin on my neck. It absorbs easily and is not at all greasy-feeling.</li>
