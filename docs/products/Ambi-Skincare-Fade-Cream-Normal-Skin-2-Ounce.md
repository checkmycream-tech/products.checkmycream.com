      <li>Nice to have a lotion and sunscreen in one which feels great on skin.</li>

      <li>Even if this result is the best I can get from this fade cream, it was totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have a great many freckles on my arms, which weren&#x27;t going away.  </li>
      <li>I bought the stuff because it has so many great reviews.</li>

      <li>but ambi make me so happy i will buy more &amp; more</li>
      <li>This product was initially effective for gradually fading (but not eliminating) some skin discoloration that started to bug me from sunburns and medication side effects.</li>

      <li>There are so many pricey creams for lightening the skin</li>
      <li>and now it look so much better now</li>
      <li>I will not be using this again unless  by some miracle is magically starts to show signs of improvement.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it will!!!  </li>
      <li>I have used Clinique and Estee Lauder products and this is far superior to both!  </li>
      <li>I am going to continue to purchase this product until my skin has a more even skin tone not too greasy light smell i can deal with</li>
      <li>I do not think this is a miracle product in that it will make my spots completely go away, but for the price I am paying, I am happy with what it is doing.  </li>

      <li>Am extremely happy overall and will continue to buy.</li>
      <li>I should  get it for free  </li>
      <li>but i think i&#x27;m going back to that to happy to say it work for me</li>
      <li>A nice fragrance was appreciated.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the cost, and works better than the peels I have used.</li>
      <li>So far so good though.</li>
      <li>I am 61 years old with fair skin</li>
      <li>My recommendation is to apply it consistently, I do so twice a day in the morning very lightly after cleaning my face and then again at night after I wash my face</li>
      <li>This is a great product for getting rid of dark spots, whether its from pregnancy or sun exposure, this fade cream works fantastic!</li>
      <li>It is the best product I have used for age spots and freckles and uneven skin tone ever!  </li>
      <li>Overall the product did hold up to my expectations and it smells good too.</li>
      <li>I was in a very well known store (think \\&quot;Bullseye\\&quot; :)  and saw this for under $5</li>
      <li>Oh and the smell of the product is not bad</li>
      <li>I have had tremendous results on my face and on my hands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Ambi for more than six months; and initially I was quite satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to see the long-term results, but using this once or twice a day in addition to light makeup really takes care of those imperfections I&#x27;ve been noticing from time to time!</li>
      <li>I figured starting with the cheapest option was the smartest thing and the reviews were pretty good too.</li>
      <li>Be aware!</li>
      <li>One side of my face, they are almost even invisible, while the darker side which botherd me more, has faded so much that I barely have to bother with make up on it any more.</li>
      <li>this is a great product that is not too harsh on acne prone skin.  </li>
      <li>Thus, this will make you more photo sensitive to the sun for a while.</li>
      <li>Thus, this will make you more photo sensitive to the sun for a while.</li>
      <li>My skin looks much more natural and evenly toned.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned (very very pale), so I scar easily.</li>
      <li>Right now I used an oil control face wash and apply this product before heading out in the morning.</li>
      <li>I was really self-conscious of them, but luckily it was winter and could keep them covered up until I found a solution.</li>
      <li>Try sunscreen daily and exfoliants (Stridex or Paula&#x27;s Choice are great) for something that actually works.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was skeptical about this fade cream, but figured since it was so inexpensive and highly recommended, I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for two weeks on brown spots on my forehead which appeared after pregnancy and on a scar on my hand that was quite bright red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw noticeable improvement in my forehead and my scar within a week. The spots and scar are still visible, but much less prominent. I plan to continue to use the cream twice daily to see if they fade more. Even if this result is the best I can get from this fade cream, it was totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this very long but read previous reviews so I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> I read the ingredients,and thew it away.</li>
    <li> I had mosquitos bites and bed bug bites all over my legs , I used this product on and off and suprisingly they faded. Now they have disappeared from my leg and they&#x27;re faint marks on my feet. Then I thought &amp;#34;If it works for my legs, how about for my face?&amp;#34; . I suffer from hyper pigmentation and ance scars . I haven&#x27;t seen any changes since I started recently but I soon will give another review!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne ever since I was 14. Still get it even at 29. Only thing that helps is when its summer and I get plenty of son. Problem is is the weather in the Chicago area is only nice for a short period of time. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past month and I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable amount of results with older acne scarring and even new breakouts heals faster and are not as red. Right now I used an oil control face wash and apply this product before heading out in the morning. Its nice to finally see all those old acne marks fading after all these years.</li>
    <li> Excellent for clearing up post inflammatory hyper pigmentation. I&#x27;m fair skinned (very very pale), so I scar easily. With trouble combination skin, acne, age, etc...this has been a problem I&#x27;ve dealt with for years, nearly decades. The problem with cystic acne is you can develop post inflammatory hyper pigmentation, which in simple terms are those dark splotchy purple/red spots that linger for months as it heals, sometimes even permanently scarring the area. And if you are older than your usual acne sufferer (ie a teenager), it takes even longer for them to go away because of the time it takes for collagen &amp; elastin to be produced in the body. They are unsightly &amp; seem to take forever to go away, especially if you get multiple flare ups of acne atop the same spot. Well, I finally managed to get the acne under control &amp; decided I needed to get a product that could help clear up the dark marks left over on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists multiple times for both acne &amp; scarring, &amp; although they are very capable, at times their remedies are costly. I needed something affordable and effective. I happened across this product amidst researched reviews &amp; reports. It was priced affordably and seemed to have majority positive reviews on various sites. I did buy this elsewhere in a single tube to try it first, before investing in a multi-pack. There are two kinds: normal &amp; oily skin. I got the one for normal, though perhaps I should have considered for oily, as it will moisturize the sites in which you apply it. But I&#x27;ve not broken out because of it thus far. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now, apply twice a day as it recommends. I wash my face, treat it for acne, apply this (ONLY to the sites of discoloration), &amp; top it off with sunblock. I wear sunblock anyway, but it is HIGHLY recommended that you wear it, especially when using this product. It works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin, within the site of application. Not using sunscreen/block, allows the spots to return once you have finishing using Ambi, because the skin&#x27;s melanin is what makes us tan &amp; freckle; protecting &amp; reacting to the sun&#x27;s rays. Thus, this will make you more photo sensitive to the sun for a while. It does have it&#x27;s own sunscreen mixed in, but you should really be mindful of your skin (the largest organ of your body) &amp; wear sunscreen everyday. &amp; don&#x27;t trust the ones only in your make up. It degrades over time &amp; tends to be a low spf. I digress, in the short amount of time, Ambi has managed not to break me out further &amp; the areas of extreme discoloration have already improved by 50%. I&#x27;m extremely please with the results. The majority of dark purple contrast has faded to a light pink or pale red. This type of result would have taken me weeks without assistance. Ambi recommends you use it for about 3 months &amp; discontinue use thereafter. I would theorize that my spots will diminish adequately long before then. Remember, there is no magic cure or youth potion, but if you take care of your skin when you are in your teens &amp; early 20&#x27;s (avoiding excessive sun, wearing sunscreen, handling acne, etc...) you&#x27;ll be much better off in the long run.

    <li> It works, not as well as I wish, but my brown spots have lightened with regular use over a period of months.</li>
    <li> Excellent condition. Always used ambi and was satisfied. Perfect for discoloration and dark spots. Cheaper than most department store prices</li>
    <li> It did what it said it&lt;br /&gt;Would do. A nice fragrance was appreciated.</li>
    <li> I have a great many freckles on my arms, which weren&#x27;t going away.  I&#x27;ve used this cream twice a day, for about a month, with no results. It smells a little odd, but I can live with that.  I&#x27;d be willing to buy another tube and try it longer, BUT.  The cream contains something dark (the sun block??), which has stained all my nails brownish all the way down, presumably from applying the cream with my hands.  Furthermore, it&#x27;s stained my white clothes where they touched places where I applied the cream.  I&#x27;m looking for a different brand.</li>
    <li> Been using religiously for about 4 weeks and I can&#x27;t say I notice a big difference. The cream does go on well and blend in nicely but I still have many dark spots (some are faded tho)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s and have 2 children, during both pregnancies I developed those ugly brown spots on my cheeks and around my eyes (not really Melasma known as the mask of pregnancy, they are more just scattered brown sun spots).  I worked in Dermatology for 7 years as an assistant, so I am very aware these are brought out by the sun, however, even with wearing a daily SPF and avoiding sun (and it was winter) I still developed them.  They have seemed to age me and make me look tired all the time since they are so close to my eyes, I simply hated looking in the mirror. I tried 2 different prescription samples I had from my dermatology days, and didn&#x27;t make one difference. I bought the very pricey Clinique Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector and while that felt and smelled fabulous on my skin, after the bottle was gone 2 1/2 months later...no change.  I was in a very well known store (think \\&quot;Bullseye\\&quot; :)  and saw this for under $5, I thought, what the heck, if it doesn&#x27;t work, at least it is one of the cheaper things I have tried.    I have been using it consistantly 2 x a day for 3 weeks now, and WOW! I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised at the changes already!  I will admit, I do not care for the smell, but since the product works and the smell only lasts a few seconds when you put it on, I will cont. using it.  It makes my skin feel soft and the dark spots have faded dramatically!  One side of my face, they are almost even invisible, while the darker side which botherd me more, has faded so much that I barely have to bother with make up on it any more. I sure wish I would have spotted this stuff sooner.    Don&#x27;t forget to always wear sunscreen (SPF 15 at least in your lotion and makeup EVERYDAY!) and then heavier kinds if you are outdoors to avoid these ugly spots from recurring.    I&#x27;m interested to see if the spots fade until they are all gone or if this is the best they will get; time will tell.    I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> takes 2-3 weeks before you see results</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks. For a rash that left dark marks on my stomach they are starting to lighten but i was hoping for faster results</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. And came package will and in excellent condition. I bought product for myself and my daughter. It has help with fading our dark spots. And giving us a even skin tone. I love all Ambi products. It was at a great price. I will purchase from this seller again. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference with my skin since I started this product. I thought it would get rid of my dark spots but I can definitely see them still. I will keep on using maybe it takes longer. Oh and the smell of the product is not bad just smells like a bunch of vitamins lol.</li>
    <li> When I was in my junior year of high school, I got chicken pox and had scars all over my face and body and I had to senior pictures and prom to look forward to and within six months, I was almost completely clear of my spots and by the year mark, they weren&#x27;t there. You have to be patient and have a near religious habit of putting it on; I think I did it two or three times a day at my worse.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant scent and nice consistency.  Seems excellent but too soon to gauge how effective it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ambi for more than six months; and initially I was quite satisfied.  My goal was to get rid of age spots on the back of my hands.  In very short time, the spots had decidedly faded.  I felt as though I was getting a &amp;#34;5-star&amp;#34; result.  But the reason for my lower rating (3-stars) is that after a period of time -- with the age spots about 1/2 to 2/3 faded -- it just seemed to stop.  I continued to apply the cream on the same schedule; but it&#x27;s never caused any further progress.  The spots are much faded -- but all still there (just lighter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it really does work, and work well...  up to a point, apparently.</li>
    <li> I love it! !!I have  been  looking  for  it for yearsin fact I should  get it for free  because I  talk about it to all my  friends.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 6 weeks straight it doesn&#x27;t work. I washed my face before applying it and it made my face very oily. I already have oily skin so it looked 5x worse.</li>
    <li> this is a great product that is not too harsh on acne prone skin.  always use sunscreen when using a fade cream of any concentration.</li>
    <li> Definitely works for old and new bruises.  For faster lifting results, dab the lotion on the dark spot.  Then apply strong tape over it.  Then apply heat to the area using a blow dryer.  Don&#x27;t put the blow dryer to close.  Just close enough.  You&#x27;ll see lifting in the next day!</li>
    <li> Ambi works, but it takes time and turns the dark patches pink for a while.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. I used it to fade mosquito bite marks over 4months. It did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely great!</li>
    <li> Not sure where all the aclaim is coming from since I have been using this product for over three months and still have every single age spot on my face that I started with!</li>
    <li> I had some pretty bad acne spots from picking at my face (to be clear this is discoloration I&#x27;m talking about not actual acne scars) in the past and this really did help clear up a lot of it I am actually impressed and I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 weeks. My recommendation is to apply it consistently, I do so twice a day in the morning very lightly after cleaning my face and then again at night after I wash my face but this time more heavily. It actually works and I wasn&#x27;t it expecting it to do its job so well.</li>
    <li> After years of ignoring sunscreen I am paying for it in my middle age.  I have age (or liver) spots on my face and one really big one that get even darker with pregnancy.  There are so many pricey creams for lightening the skin but I figured I try this one since it&#x27;s cheaper.  I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 2 months now and I think there is a difference.  I still have the spots but they are lighter.  I do not think this is a miracle product in that it will make my spots completely go away, but for the price I am paying, I am happy with what it is doing.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Pore cloggers acne sufferrers stay away if your acne is gone COMPLETELY then you may wanna try this</li>
    <li> I used it every night until the bottle was finished and saw no difference on my face so I went to a doctor and had them chemically removed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love and would recommend this product. I’ve noticed more even skin tone on areas that had hyperpigmentation and previous scarring, mainly from acne and other injuries. My skin is smoother and looks healthier. This cream has a pleasant/fresh scent and leaves no residue or oily feeling after application. Feels lightweight on my skin as I apply it twice daily. I appreciate that it contains sunscreen so as to protect my skin when outdoors. The delivery was very timely as I received my package only 4 days after placing my order with standard free shipping. When compared with other fade creams that cost almost double the price for a smaller quantity, this cream definitely gets you the most for your money. Friends and family say I look more radiant and glowing and I have even started wearing less makeup due to this cream. Am extremely happy overall and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> just a week back i brought this product ambi skincare normal and immediately started using it that night and within 2 applications i could see my face glow now that a week is over my acne spots have lightened a lot and my skin is so soft.loving this cream.</li>
    <li> Cream is great but i give it 4 stars because it took a ridiculous amount of time to get to nyc area from texas</li>
    <li> This product worked for me.  I used it for two weeks religiously morning and night and I seen improvements in my dark spots and my skin. I have a more even complexion. Overall the product did hold up to my expectations and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> If it were to act any faster, it would burn your skin and you don&#x27;t want that. I&#x27;m currently using the product and I&#x27;ve had my freckles since I was a kid. I didn&#x27;t think this would work but, I figured, what the heck. I started using a pumice stone for my rough skin. It says not to use it on your face but I did lightly and later noticed my freckles and sunspots were fading. I could see where my skin was lifting. DO NOT RUSH THE PROCESS! I did and I looked like I had pieces of bacon on my face. Slowly. Apply soap and move the stone in a circular motion both ways. The stone even got rid of my dark skin on my figures, elbows, knees, and cleared up my acne. Oh yea, and it removes hair. Not all but some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ambi for YEARS! It&#x27;s good for dark spots on the face mainly. on the rest of the body it takes a LOT longer before you see any results that&#x27;s the only downfall</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to lighten my age spots.  It took about six weeks but they are gone.  It actually works.  I used it once a day in the evening and let it work over night.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Having spent a fortune on highly priced dark spot faders from the beauty counter which dont work I found this on Amazon. At the price I thought what the heck. Progress is slow but it seems to be working. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Together with the bar soap it works really well. It is also very reasonably priced for what it does. Not easy to find in stores</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my mom. It has made a big difference on the dark spots she had under her eyes. She has been using it for 6 months now, but saw results after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Smells gross!! Threw it away. Don&#x27;t want this on my face.</li>
    <li> I used it for 3 months and have not seen adramatic difference. I would not recommend. It has a weird smell to it too</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 or 3 weeks, so far my skin has improved greatly. It&#x27;s not irritating but it is a little oily. The oily feeling when I wake up is the only reason why I give it 4 out of 5 stars. So far so good though.</li>
    <li> Ambi works just as well as expensive products...in fact, this product works better than most. I would say the sun spot on my face was reduced by 30% after using it for one month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for eight months, now... Religiously... And I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the lightness of my skin.  I have a dark spot on my left cheek, and have tried various ways to get rid of it. Ambi Cream hasn&#x27;t lightened it one iota. I bought the stuff because it has so many great reviews. I&#x27;m 100 percent positive I&#x27;m using it correctly (how do you mess up lotion??!!?), and - to sound like a broken record - No. Results.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, if you do decide to buy it. I hope you have a better outcome than I have!</li>
    <li> Works but is extremelyyyyyyy slow. You may see results in three months. And it has an expiration date. You are supposes to use it within three months of opening it. I&#x27;ve had lightening creams work within a week. So this is a slow acting product for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care what people say about ambi it work for me I love it no I&#x27;m trying to be pale that is not the look I&#x27;m going for i&#x27;m a natural black women and i&#x27;m 2 tone but over the years i been using the ambi face cream this kind and i have to say it work and not only i use the cream  but the soap to i use the lotion one time but i think i&#x27;m going back to that to happy to say it work for me i just want that honey brown skin tone no ligher then that that is good for me it was so dark around the mouth area and now it look so much better now my cheeks now i can look in the miorr now and i can see what it as done for me it did not work over night and i still got alot more work to do but ambi make me so happy i will buy more &amp; more til i dead and gone keep it up ambi thank god that he made something for the african women can use it and it work so much♡</li>
    <li> I&#x27;be only had this cream for a couple of weeks, but it actually works!  I have been applying it to the dark spots on my hands twice a day and and they are fading.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner. Has a very unpleasant smell and is very oily after being on the skin a few hours. I recommend using it only at night and then washing your face in the morning. I have had no change in my skin apperence since using though. Dark marks have not faded even slightly. I used this product every morning and night for 4 months and nothing, nada, zero, zilch improvement. I will not be using this again unless  by some miracle is magically starts to show signs of improvement.</li>
    <li> I received my product fairly quickly and have been using it everyday since getting it. My daily routine has been using the Nubian Heritage African Black Soap to clean my face and then applying this cream after the fact. It really makes my skin feel smooth, but of course the main objective is, does it really help with the fading. So far, and this could be because I have only been using it for about a week now, I haven&#x27;t noticed any crazy changes, but again, I&#x27;ll give it more time. I can say that I will continue to use this product because it does make my skin feel amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years. I had brown spots on the back of my hands probably from being out in the sun so much. I put this on every night before bed and the spots, while not completely gone have faded a lot. And it&#x27;s really inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this cream for about a month and a half now and it has faded an old acne scar I had on my cheek. So yes, it definitely works; you just need to have patience, and above all, apply it consistently.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore and I use it everyday to keep my face moist and it doesn&#x27;t fade my skin.</li>
    <li> I keep this on hand.  It is the best product I have used for age spots and freckles and uneven skin tone ever!  I have used Clinique and Estee Lauder products and this is far superior to both!  I have had tremendous results on my face and on my hands. The price and the product are amazing! I am 61 years old with fair skin and I have lots of sun damage...my daughter in law who is studying to be an estotician has even commented on the improvement and change in my skin tone and age spots.  Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product but was totally disappointed. When I first applied it to my face, it was incredibly oily and did not absorb into my skin. I left it thinking that eventually it would go in but it was so greasy that I eventually had to wash it off. It actually clogged my pores and made me break out. I felt like I&#x27;d rubbed Crisco on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may consider using it on other parts of my body but definitely won&#x27;t be putting it on my face ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while I stopped for a while but I started to use it again. It honestly helps with toning your skintone. When it gets to summer certain parts of my skin gets darker and its tones it up just the right amount. It&#x27;s not a skin lightening products it fades dark spots and evens out your skin. I recommend this to anyone with that problem</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my dark spots. I used this for one month, every morning and night, and I saw no difference. Given you might have to use it longer, but the reviews and descriptions made it sounds like this really worked. However, I was sadly disappointed and it was a waste of money. It smells like sunless tanner. I would recommend CAUDALIE VINOPERFECT Radiance Serum. Its the only thing that works</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my light freckles after using it twice daily for 2 months. Pretty disappointed with this product, not sure if there&#x27;s any other products like this that work seeing as how this is the first one I have tried. 2 stars cause the scent wasn&#x27;t horrible and didn&#x27;t do any negative damage.</li>
    <li> I am mixed and have a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; skin tone. I recently had an unfortunate bout of chest acne that left dark spots once it subsided. I was really self-conscious of them, but luckily it was winter and could keep them covered up until I found a solution. I originally was looking at the Proactiv dark spot treatment and many of the reviews mentioned Ambi. I figured starting with the cheapest option was the smartest thing and the reviews were pretty good too. So I purchased it and have been using it twice a day every day for almost a month now. I have definitely seen a difference. Some spots have faded away and the rest are definitely lighter and I assume will fade away given more time. I was worried about breaking out when using it (didn&#x27;t want it to clog my pores and create more acne thus making even more dark spots!!) but I haven&#x27;t had that issue. I did try it on some spots on my face but I had a slight break out where I used it. It could&#x27;ve been a complete coincidence though as its a normal break out area for me... but I stopped using it on my face regardless. But overall, I love the product and it smells wonderful. By the time warmer weather comes around I suspect the spots will be gone. And even after using it for about a month I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle. So I definitely recommend people try out Ambi before trying out the more expensive products.</li>
    <li> This product works nicely the moment you put it on. It also has a long lasting effect as the brown spots on my face have lightened considerably. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ambi for the dark spots on my face for about 6 months now and I really love this product. I have sun spots on my face and using this cream twice daily as recommended, I see a noticeable difference. Other products I have tried have showed no results and have cost way more. This product is easy to use and applies evenly. The product is also affordable and effective. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to get rid of sun spots or dark spots on their face.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s a nice feeling cream, it really did not fade my two dark spots at all.  I used it consistently for over 6 weeks and there was no discernible fading of my spots.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for getting rid of dark spots, whether its from pregnancy or sun exposure, this fade cream works fantastic! The results are gradual, but with proper and consistent use, you will get the results you want. I&#x27;m so glad i found something that actually works! A definite must buy, I&#x27;d recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Used product for two weeks .  Began to see sun spots fading. Texture of skin improved also. Will continue to use product and I recommend it</li>
    <li> This product has really brightened my face. I have some areas of my face that are a shade darker and even have plentiful freckles. After using this product for a couple of weeks I began to notice a different in my freckles. They became lighter and this fading cream truly works wonders. I never liked my freckles much but this cream has lightened them up significant hand I have so much more confidence now. My skin looks much more natural and evenly toned. I actually have stopped using foundation.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  And for the price, I cannot believe it!  I am 40 and have been a sun-lover my entire life.  I get super dark in the summer and have an olive tone in winter.  I use 70 SPF on my face every time I&#x27;m poolside but I noticed that I started getting sun spots about 2 years ago.  I did a lot of research, and I usually spend a decent amount on my skincare regiment (most of it being Origins brand), but this AMBI cream kept coming up with top marks.  For a little over $8, I figured I would give it a try.  It does exactly what it says it will!!!  I started using it over the winter and saw the spots begin to fade.  I just went to Destin, FL for a week and got a fabulous tan, which made some of the spots show back up, but way lighter than they were last summer, with many of them completely gone. I had an eraser sized one above my eyebrow and it did not return!  It is a nearly perfect product.  It smells funny, but get over it.  That&#x27;s the price you pay for the ingredients that you want and need.  BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> The service was great, the price too, but the cream for my skin was a disaster!!! I applied it to my two dark spots (very small amount, the size of a lentil) and then, like five minutes later or so I applied moisturizer (that I&#x27;ve been using for years), went to a meeting and four hours latter.... My whole face broke out, I had little pimples aaaaaall over my face, it was itchy... I looked like a beet, it looked like I had rosacea... and it took me two weeks to get rid of them. My skin was soooo dry that I had to apply moisturizer 5-7 times a day... I&#x27;m not exagerating, like desert sand! It might have worked for a lot of people, but for me it was a dissaster!!! And I&#x27;ve even put hand cream of my face before, body lotion... And never got a reaction before from any cream before... For me... Not worth the try. Thank God my skin is back to normal... I was misserable for two weeks. I will never apply a new product on my face without spot testing it! Be aware!</li>
    <li> This product was initially effective for gradually fading (but not eliminating) some skin discoloration that started to bug me from sunburns and medication side effects. I put up with the horrible smell and potentially toxic hydroquinone after I saw limited results. Previously had tried three department store brands and a drugstore product with zero results. Unfortunately, ONE time I forgot to put sunscreen on and sat outdoors at a cafe, and bingo, the next day I had an outcropping of new brown spots (melasma). Yes, granted, the directions warned this could be the result, but I&#x27;m not perfect. A product with zero margin for error and can harm, is too risky. This cream, in my opinion is dangerous and hazardous and we should have it off the shelves, following suit of the E.U.</li>
    <li> Used it twice a day for 2 1/2 months.  Make no difference in a couple of spots I have on my hands.  So for me, I&#x27;ll not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought a spot remover from Macy&#x27;s and paid $125 and it took a year to slightly fade this dark spot by my eye.  When I bought this product from Amazon and used it, the spot was gone completely within a week.  The area got irritated initially and got itchy in a couple if days, but that subsided.  I AM SO HAPPY THE SPOT IS GONE, and I&#x27;ve had it for years  it and was growing bigger every year.  My doctor said to just live with it and that it was the product if aging and sun damage.  Ha ha, it&#x27;s gone thanks to the Ambi Skincare Faded Cream. BTW I&#x27;m a 42yr old male.</li>
    <li> It take little time but it work on my darkspots and they are gettin lighter its taking the really dark spots a little longer to lighten up.</li>
    <li> It simply works if you are consistent.  Keep it by your bedside and it easily can become routine.  Yes.  I would recommend third product.  Affordable too.</li>
    <li> Does not work- go to a dermatologist !!!</li>
    <li> Try sunscreen daily and exfoliants (Stridex or Paula&#x27;s Choice are great) for something that actually works. Ambi smells like grandma perfume.</li>
    <li> I am going to continue to purchase this product until my skin has a more even skin tone not too greasy light smell i can deal with</li>
    <li> Ambi&#x27;s Fade Cream is fantastic!  It is easily the best fade cream on the market today!  In only a few days I noticed a drastic improvement with my dark spots.  I have only Ambi to thank for such an improvement in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old female, my skin is dry and I have small dark spots around my forehead and chin area. I used Ambi for two weeks before I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore, not only is it really oily for my dry face but it made me break out massively in every spot I put it on. The only reason Im giving two stars is because it barely noticeably lightened my dark spots. Side effects not worth it.</li>
    <li> I am a 49 year old caucasian male who started getting cystic acne about 5 years ago out of the clear blue. It gradually subsided about 2 years ago and left some raised purple and red scars. I tried 3 different remedies to no avail. I was about to give up when I started to research Ambi Fade Cream. I read 50% bad, 50% good and decided to try one last time. The first application left my skin a little irritated and red. I then used it once a day and noticed results in only about 7 days. I highly recommend that if you get an initial reaction just cut back a little. I have seen the redness go to a light pink, the raised scar to flatten, the irritation has gone and the affected area is now pink after only 7 days. I can only imagine what it will look like in a month, don&#x27;t just give up on this stuff it will work.</li>
    <li> I am a black girl and I have been for years with this stubborn dark patches on my face. I have also tried several products to make it go to no avail. This is my 3rd week using this product and I can testify that my dark spots are fading away. Even my family and friends are inspired to buy it now.</li>
    <li> WOMEN OF COLOR, DO NOT PUT THIS CRAP ON YOUR FACE. ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. Just read some of the ingredients in this and type it into google. Can&#x27;t believe this awful poison is being marketed in America - and of course it would be directed to people of color. This literally burned me when I put it on for a few seconds, I washed it off and I could still feel the burning - like scrubbing your skin with baking soda, lemon juice, and vinegar. Someone needs to start a campaign to take this of the market!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily skin and this product did everything the other reviews said.  Very light-weight, leaves non-greasy feeling which I can apply concealer over shortly after.  I do use a little extra lotion due to winter months my skin is a little on the dry side.  But am very pleased with this product. Nice to have a lotion and sunscreen in one which feels great on skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product three times a week for a month and there is a change already being seen. Easy to apply at night.</li>
    <li> The smell is really nice. I have been using it for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t seen a difference, but moisturizes well! No complaints!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for about 10 year (I am 58 yrs. old) and has gotten rid some sun spot while keeping other from getting any bigger.  I can&#x27;t find it in drug stores any more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and it really evens out my skin tone and clears up any discolorations from breaking out in the skin. I&#x27;ve also had severe acne in the past, so this helps out with those acne scars that are still apparent in the skin. I&#x27;ve yet to see the long-term results, but using this once or twice a day in addition to light makeup really takes care of those imperfections I&#x27;ve been noticing from time to time! I highly recommend trying this product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> First off; I just wanted to say, Ambi is a LIFE SAVER. I&#x27;m a 25 year old African-American male and I&#x27;ve had dark spots from acne as well as some other accidents on my face for about ten years now. It has always been a major blow to my self-esteem and its something that has bothered me for years, considering all the flaws were always my fault(picked at face, burned, cut, etc). For the past three weeks, I&#x27;ve been using Ambi every day(and night) religiously only to find my face slowly coming back to it&#x27;s original state. Every morning I analyze my face just to see it&#x27;s progress and I&#x27;m ecstatic. I&#x27;m not even completely done with my little personal project and I&#x27;m already seeing POSITIVE results. The key is to apply the cream ONLY on what you&#x27;re trying to lighten and to not apply too much. Just enough to let it do it&#x27;s job and let the sun naturally even out what you&#x27;re working on. I love Ambi. After three years of searching the internet and using everything from cocoa butter, lemon juice, honey, and many other expensive skin care products, I can finally say that I&#x27;m at the end of my journey of getting my even complexion back. I give Ambi a 11/10!</li>
    <li> It did moisturizer but did not do anything for the dark spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months. I&#x27;ve bought 4 bottles of this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing. A little does go a long way but I use it so much that I ran out of product fairly quickly. I would recommend this to anyone who is suffering from acne/scars. It does wonders! I use it on dark spots on my face and for acne scars. This is the best fade cream on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months twice a day, and I think it has faded many of my age spots.  I gave it 4 stars because hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of all of the spots.  I will revise it after the six months.  It is well worth the cost, and works better than the peels I have used.</li>
</ol>
