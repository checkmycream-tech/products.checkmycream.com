    <li> It is ok, but the one size fits all means I actually have to use tape to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fall of my feet.</li>
    <li> These are great! My wife loves them and shared them with our neighbor. Afriend of hers found them and gave my wife one to try. She liked them so much we ordered the box of 2 dozen.&lt;br /&gt;One thing she does is put socks over the NuPore.</li>
    <li> These work great, but are for tiny feet.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. Wore them over night with another pair of socks over them. In the morning my feet were awesome. And remain soft for a while.  My daughter also loves them.</li>
    <li> Love these socks that make my feet so soft! They are for smaller feet. I wear a size 6 shoe.</li>
    <li> This one all woman with Crap heels should try its is amazing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice ans soft, works like a light lotion for the skin. I actually use it with the heating socks for more absorption</li>
    <li> I wear mine at night. Feet feel wet as opposed to really moisturized. I think I will stick to a good thick foot moisture cream and warm socks when these run out. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Fantastic in terms of usage for a quarter of an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to buy and use after a hard day of walking and standing long</li>
    <li> ARRIVED ON TIME KIND OF BIG ON ME SEEMED TO WORK OK</li>
    <li> The absolute BEST for my feet. I use these overnight. I slather my feet with coconut oil then slip on the booties then socks on top, to keep them on and make it easier to walk. Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> I got 24 pairs, 2 separate small boxes with 12 pairs on each box!! I love these so much I literally go to sleep in them and wake up to sweaty feet but soooo soft!!  I tried using them on my hubby but he is a 10 1/2 and the sock ripped on Him.  but you can wear them with socks over...  great for dry heels</li>
    <li> I really like these socks.  After having my first baby, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of time for taking care of myself.  My feet were getting very dry and the calluses were almost out of control after only 2 months.  I got these as a time saver for moisturizing.  I put these on after a shower and can then walk around and take care of the many household and baby chores that need to be done.  After 20+ minutes, I&#x27;m done and my feet feel great.  I&#x27;m a US woman&#x27;s size 8.5 and these fit just fine for me.</li>
    <li> I got a case of Nu-Pore Moisturizing Gloves instead of socks and I already have a case of gloves. so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nu-Pore Moisturizing Socks, Case of 24, but there only 12 package!!!</li>
