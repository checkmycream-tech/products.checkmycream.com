      <li>Specially when customer see it and they are like &amp;#34;Winter is Coming&amp;#34; and i&#x27;m like &amp;#34;That&#x27;s</li>
      <li>At least she still has a cool token of an unforgettable party; she just can&#x27;t wear it anymore!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a fun pin for fans of the books/series.  </li>

      <li>so I&#x27;d say its worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a nice pin.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fun when people refer to me as Lord Hand.</li>
      <li>Very nice, but smaller than it looks in the photos, although the measurements are clear in the description.</li>
      <li>Its very good quality, but very small, its not aluminum</li>
      <li>When I showed concern for it being lost in the mail, the company sent another right out.</li>
      <li>It is solid with a good strong simply pin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as big as in the show, but that&#x27;s better.</li>
      <li>Smaller than the one from the show, more of a pin</li>
      <li>What really made it worth</li>
      <li>Other than that it looks &#x27;&#x27;nice&#x27;&#x27;</li>
      <li>I gave it to my son, who watches the HBO series and he refuses to wear the pin as long as the Lanasters are in power  :)</li>
      <li>Really nice pin for less than $4.</li>
      <li>Large pin to attach to clothing.</li>

      <li>A beautiful replica that was, sadly, very poorly constructed.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Overall well worth the price</li>
      <li>Although it seems to take forever and a half since it ships directly from China, this is a stylish accessory to take places.</li>
      <li>and im surprised.</li>
      <li>the back pin has been attached well and, although i handle said pin gently</li>
      <li>Just a reminder that this is a Pin so is not the actual size you will see on the series, but for a pin is it is pretty big tho.</li>
      <li>beyond that, it is very stiff and does not bend easily.</li>
      <li>but it seems to be solid as far as quality goes.</li>
      <li>Cool, just a tad small</li>
      <li>Love the game of thrones I thought it was going to be bigger</li>

<li> Cool, just a tad small</li>
<li> Love the game of thrones I thought it was going to be bigger</li>
<li> I bought this pin for myself because I&#x27;m a big fan of Game of Thrones, and I thought I might add this to a cosplay for my original cosplay.</li>
<li> So, the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> Huge game of thrones fan!</li>
<li> I actually cut the pin back off with small a wire cutter and carefully hot glued it to a small antique-looking box that I had.</li>
<li> Slightly smaller than expected, still grest</li>
<li> while not nearly as big as the hand of the king brooch as seen on game of thrones, this is still decent size.</li>
<li> Its actually gold not bronze and the index finger is a little bent to the side</li>
<li> My only complaint is that its a bit smaller then the one on the show.</li>
<li> Delivery time was about 10 days, as expected.</li>
<li> The piece that holds the pin closed broke off!</li>
<li> The paint job is bad and the piece isn&#x27;t clean cut.</li>
<li> Pin part is less than desirable but manageable.</li>
<li> The pin I got looks nothing like the one of the picture and that was a big disappointment, it is completely different.</li>
<li> Yes it&#x27;s small.</li>
<li> A bit on the small side  </li>
<li> at least once.</li>
<li> Arrived late.</li>
<li> I mean quality alone..</li>
<li> Smaller than I thought it would be, but not in a bad way.</li>
<li> However, I am a little disappointed in how small it is.</li>
<li> I purchased 4 of these for our Game of Thrones Water Cooler club at work.</li>
<li> but I am going to have a very hard time giving it up!</li>

    <li> Cool, just a tad small</li>
    <li> The pin looks quite similar to the actual one but the circle around the hand has a way different design. Also the index finger kinda petrudes away fro the hand making it look very awkward</li>
    <li> Triple A all the way.</li>
    <li> Well, I guess you get what you pay for. The pin I got looks nothing like the one of the picture and that was a big disappointment, it is completely different. Other than that it looks &#x27;&#x27;nice&#x27;&#x27; but the index finger it&#x27;s weird.</li>
    <li> Awesome love it thanks</li>
    <li> Flimsy, costume jewelry. Much smaller than the original costume piece.</li>
    <li> A really  beautiful pin !&lt;br /&gt;Carefully packaged, a product of good quality &amp; verry good gift for any fan of GOT!</li>
    <li> Slightly smaller than expected, still grest</li>
    <li> Smaller than the one from the show, more of a pin</li>
    <li> Love the pin. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I read some bad things about the offical product. I did some research and I found this one. To my surprise it looked great. My only complaint is that its a bit smaller then the one on the show. But its still worth it.</li>
    <li> Very nice, but smaller than it looks in the photos, although the measurements are clear in the description.</li>
    <li> A bit on the small side  but it was very useful and I used it for many accations hope you like it</li>
    <li> Its very good quality, but very small, its not aluminum so I&#x27;d say its worth the money. It could use better packaging. It came in an envelope with bubble wrap.</li>
    <li> The paint job is bad and the piece isn&#x27;t clean cut.</li>
    <li> I presented this to my maid-of-honor to wear at my wedding. It was perfect for the ceremony, but it didn&#x27;t make it through the night. The piece that holds the pin closed broke off! A beautiful replica that was, sadly, very poorly constructed. At least she still has a cool token of an unforgettable party; she just can&#x27;t wear it anymore!</li>
    <li> This pin is AWESOME. I love it! Its a Christmas gift for someone but I am going to have a very hard time giving it up!</li>
    <li> Just a reminder that this is a Pin so is not the actual size you will see on the series, but for a pin is it is pretty big tho. I love, i use it all the time at work and it is a conversation starter. Specially when customer see it and they are like &amp;#34;Winter is Coming&amp;#34; and i&#x27;m like &amp;#34;That&#x27;s what she said&amp;#34; and the is just an awkward silence...anyways is great</li>
    <li> how things look online and how they actually are. I mean quality alone.. Its a crap shoot. I really liked this pin and thought it was extremely cool repro. It is solid with a good strong simply pin. Its made well and im surprised. Great little &amp;#34;game of&amp;#34; bauble.</li>
    <li> while not nearly as big as the hand of the king brooch as seen on game of thrones, this is still decent size. beyond that, it is very stiff and does not bend easily. the back pin has been attached well and, although i handle said pin gently, i get the feeling it could take some abuse before breaking off. all in all, excellent quality and i have received many positive comments from people who recognize it. i highly recommend. great product with excellent durability.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fun pin for fans of the books/series.  I gave it to my son, who watches the HBO series and he refuses to wear the pin as long as the Lanasters are in power  :)</li>
    <li> I bought this pin for myself because I&#x27;m a big fan of Game of Thrones, and I thought I might add this to a cosplay for my original cosplay. It&#x27;s very well detailed and beautifully crafted. However, I am a little disappointed in how small it is. The description says 7.6cm, which is about 3 inches (according to Google), but the pin I got doesn&#x27;t seem to be much larger than 1.5 inches, if that. So, the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Gave it to a friend for a gift and he loved it. Yes it&#x27;s small. Yes it looks frail. But its a great gift for GoT fans. What really made it worth it was he&#x27;s my bosses #2 guy --- our office&#x27;s HotK.</li>
    <li> This is a very quality pin.. Made of sturdy meta with great attention to detail. It was a gift for my husband and he absolutely LOVES it</li>
    <li> Love the game of thrones I thought it was going to be bigger put still like it</li>
    <li> Its quality is not too shabby, it&#x27;s very sturdy for its light weight. Arrived late. But I still love it and it&#x27;s fun when people refer to me as Lord Hand.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend likes this. Great price, takes awhile to arrive.</li>
    <li> it may not be the exact replica of the brooch but its perfect for every Game of Thrones fan who feels like they want to be the Hand of The King :D Its actually gold not bronze and the index finger is a little bent to the side but hopefully from afar it isn&#x27;t noticeable. Thank you though and I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Two-day shipping, which is great. Really nice pin for less than $4. Nice detailing. Large pin to attach to clothing. I actually cut the pin back off with small a wire cutter and carefully hot glued it to a small antique-looking box that I had. It looks great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! My fiancée will wear it as a boutonnière for our wedding! The quality is great and it&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
    <li> It took over a month and a half to get to me, so I couldn&#x27;t use it for my wedding (boutineer), however, it is very nice and a great price. When I showed concern for it being lost in the mail, the company sent another right out. It&#x27;s a perfect miniature of the one on the show. I would definitely recommend if you have the patience!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Looks great on a nice blazer.</li>
    <li> Huge game of thrones fan! this pin is amazing</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I anticipated but still very nice detail.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 of these for our Game of Thrones Water Cooler club at work. Everyone was delighted with them. Delivery time was about 10 days, as expected. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my friend. It looks pretty good. It&#x27;s not as big as in the show, but that&#x27;s better. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than I imagined but it seems to be solid as far as quality goes.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s such a nice pin.</li>
    <li> Held togethor at the bottom by a parallel pin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Sturdy&#x27;, but not THAT sturdy.</li>
    <li> Although it seems to take forever and a half since it ships directly from China, this is a stylish accessory to take places. My only quality caveat is that you should treat this like a fancy accessory and not handle it like a big brute. Overall well worth the price and yes even the time.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be, but not in a bad way. Bought for my girlfriend for her bday and she loves it. She&#x27;s read all books etc. at least once. I just watch the shows with her but do enjoy the story. Has a nice weight to it. Pin part is less than desirable but manageable.</li>
