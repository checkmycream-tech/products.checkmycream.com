<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it does the job -- simple as that.</li>
    <li> Feels fresh and smells good. The size is pretty small... I hope it works good, this is the first time I use it</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on television.  It was very highly recommended by a consumer group so I decided to give it a try.  I searched on-line and found the best price at Amazon.  Prompt delivery and great price were two of the reasons I bought it.  So far so good.  Hoping to see an improvement in the eye area in the near future.</li>
    <li> I am using this product twice per day, but I have not notice any difference around my eyes. Maybe I have not used it long enough.I am now in my third week and the crows feet are still there. The eye serum I used by Avon prior to purchasing this more expensive product, worked about the same. Both products soften the appearance of my wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love it - tap it on under your eyes and above on your browbones, before applying moisturizer. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy and seems to help with puffiness.  And while it may be my imagination (or wishful thinking!) it does seem to improve the papery fine lines too!</li>
    <li> Meh. Not sure if it does anything.</li>
    <li> This feels really great around my eyes, very soothing. My eyes look brighter and I look rested after I use it. It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I read about this serum in a magazine and ordered this bottle to give it a go. It is wonderful and I will re-order soon.</li>
    <li> Had allergic reaction to this eye serum.  Also, found it a bit too drying for someone over the age of 50.</li>
    <li> soothes the eye area well</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye serum for 6 months now and think it is the best  eye serum that I have found.  Very light and I have noticed that I have no wrinkles - so I guess it is working.</li>
    <li> This product, without doubt, is the best eye cream I have ever used, goes on very smoothly and already can see the difference..</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a month and it does help with the eye wrinkles, I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I began using this after seeing it on the Today Show with Kathy Lee Gifford and Hoda.  On the show not only did I find that its very popular in Hollywood, and with Bobbi Thomas&#x27;s clients, but also KLG go to eye product.  I ordered for first at that time, about 6 months ago. I truly now understand why it&#x27;s so popular.  I&#x27;ve never used an eye serum before this. My under eye is so hydrated now, and I&#x27;ve seen dramaric decrease in fine lines, an puffiness.  A very little goes a long way which is also a plus.</li>
    <li> Really works, totally love . I use this with the klorane under eye patches and it makes the creepiness under my eyes dissapear</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. It&#x27;s pricey but it lasts me usually about 2 1/2 months so it&#x27;s not bad for the price. I see a noticeable difference when I use it.</li>
    <li> As advertised... worked ok</li>
    <li> I having been using this product for about a month now and have not seen much results.  I use a lot of Dermologica products and this was the first time a product disappointed. It has a nice scent, but it&#x27;s not enough for me to purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product goes on smooth but I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference in my eye area. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2weeks.</li>
    <li> Dried my eye area out, husband has no problems with it. Guess I just don&#x27;t do well with this brand, just my skin.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described, very quick mailing service.  I have been using this product for the over the last year, and can see the difference.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 5 months and have not seen any difference with the fine lines and wrinkles especially for the price.</li>
    <li> $50 for .5 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this at last yr&#x27;s IMATS for maybe $40. This goes on much more liquidy than other serums I&#x27;ve tried. Goes on very smoothly and easily and evaporates into nothing rapidly. I always wait at least 2 min before applying eye cream and moisturizer (I use a face serum that I apply the same time as this). Non irritating and lasts forever! I use at night only. For those that don&#x27;t like creamy/thick texture in an eye serum, you might want to give this a try. I would repurchase, but only at some kind of discount. This is too much for me full-priced.</li>
    <li> I had been using Clinque for years and was amazed at how helpful Dermalogica has calmed and soothed the area under my eyes, no bumps, my eyes don&#x27;t tear and used properly has a long life.  Thank you Dermalogica.</li>
    <li> My esthetician told me this was a new product that was very good and she was right. I noticed a difference within the first two nights of using it. As always Dermalogica hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
