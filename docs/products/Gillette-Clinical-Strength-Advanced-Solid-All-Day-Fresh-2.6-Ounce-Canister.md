<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> All of a sudden I started sweating profusely this year. I tried jockey staycool tshirts and socks, but I was still sweating. I started this product a couple of months ago, and it did the job. It&#x27;s kind of messy if you don&#x27;t give it enough time to dry, but I managed through it. Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Kim Sizemore</li>
    <li> After using this product for two weeks, I don&#x27;t think I will ever change the type of antiperspirant I use again.  This does reduce wetness by one third (as advertised) over anything else on the market.  When I read the instructions, I was skeptical when it directed me to apply it at night and that a morning application was not needed even after bathing.  I usually exercise in the morning and shower immediately thereafter.  I figured after showering, this would not be effective for the remainder of the day.  Much to my surprise, I did not need a second application and it still provided better wetness reduction than any other antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The scent is similar to baby powder.  It&#x27;s pleasant, yet not over powering.  This product is definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this product? It rolls on easy like a gel yet is dry like a solid.  I have zero pit stains when using this product and I stay fresh for more than one day if need be which is convenient if you are camping and have no access to a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes its expensive but a little goes a long way, a single click is enough to keep dry and smell free.  My previous Gillette gel required at least 3 clicks and it made my arm pits sticky and my shirts crunchy.</li>
    <li> I swet a ton, works great, I think you become immune after a while so I change it up to degree every now and then, but this is great stuff</li>
    <li> Until society decides to loosen up and smelling like two day old enchiladas is no longer a social stigma I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used 1.7 ounce canister GILLETTE CLINICAL STRENGTH before. And worked for me. I live outside US and i never found this product from here. Though i bought this item from amazon.com and subscribed for 15%. I will buy this product again for sure.  This product works very good, and smells good too.  One thing: i noticed chicks liked the smell. :)</li>
    <li> I really like the Gillette clinical deodorant. It is a tad tricky to use at first until you get \\&quot;the hang\\&quot; of clicking the the little wheel at the bottom until you get some deodorant coming through the holes in the top.  But once you get that, it is just really good deodorant that lasts more than a day, keeps perspiration to a minimum and has never caused a speck of rash for me which has been a problem with so many more expensive products.[[ASIN:B001F51QJ8 Gillette Clinical Strength Advanced Solid Anti-Perspirant, All Day Fresh, 1.7-Ounce Stick (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot and this product has really helped me. It stops sweat from showing on my shirt s</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot, and even using this one i sweat. But compared to other anti-perspirant deodorants I am incredibly happy with this one, great size too.</li>
    <li> I dig this stuff! Smells good and it works really well for me. I often switch between using this and a roll-on product to keep things interesting.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now and will not switch back to anything else. This deodorant protects without leaving yellow stains on white undershirts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big sweater (I sweat a lot; I&#x27;m not an article of clothing), and this is terrific.  You can&#x27;t find this large size in the grocery/drug stores, so I&#x27;m glad I have it!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stain white your clothing either.</li>
    <li> My husband discovered this deodorant a few months back.  When it&#x27;s time for a new stick - it would be out in whatever store we looked.  Finally decided to order several sticks ahead of time from amazon.  This is the only deodorant he will use, so I will continue to order this on line.  Product works great and smells good.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different deodorants in my life and none compare to the effectiveness of the Gillette Clinical Strength.</li>
    <li> How could it have taken so long for someone to design such a simple product that works effortlessly and flawlessly</li>
    <li> It really does work significantly better than the standard antiperspirants that you get in stores. Those never worked so well for me. I wasn&#x27;t sweating at a level that would cause me to talk to a doctor about it, but by the end of the day, whether I had been active or sedate, I&#x27;d always have wet marks on my shirts. I switched to the clinical strength stuff, and even applying it once every other day, I&#x27;m almost perfectly dry every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> My husband produces a very strong pit odor and we have tried multiple deodorants without much success until we found this one. I am thrilled to say that it works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend. He likes it a lot. He has a problem with the sweat but this desodorant really helps!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever smelled ever again after using this haha. It lasts all night and when it gets wet after being applied, it smells AMAZING. My deodorant for life.</li>
    <li> is the best deodorant you can buy! My armpits sweat a lot even if I am not doing anything they sweat. This deodorant helps me not sweat as much and when I do it is a small amount. My armpits still smell great. If you sweat a lot I recommend this.</li>
