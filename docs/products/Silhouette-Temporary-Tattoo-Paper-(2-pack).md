      <li>Perfect for very temporary tattoos.</li>
      <li>Was very easy to</li>
      <li>Found the instructions very easy to follow - didn&#x27;t have any printing, smudging or adhesive</li>
      <li>Make sure to have your design correct before printing and enjoy!!</li>
      <li>So pleased and I will be buying more!</li>
      <li>printed out my own tattoos for a photo shoot I was doing and the application was so easy.</li>
      <li>A lot of the top sheets had bubbles in them.  </li>
      <li>I tried a couple of different products but found this the best appearing and easiest to use.</li>
      <li>However, there is no margin for error when adhering the plastic transfer sheet on top of your printed design.</li>
      <li>earlier reviewer mentioned an excellent idea to use these on children for identification purposes when on vacation, visiting attractions or even just taking a trip to the mall.  </li>
      <li>I love this tattoo paper.</li>
      <li>Many people were concerned that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut it, so as team captain, I needed something to boost their confidence.</li>
      <li>Use photo software to get the most images per page.</li>
      <li>The film is thicker than most.</li>
      <li>many would come with this</li>
      <li>The tats I made myself using this paper were even better than store-bought tats.</li>
      <li>sure to trim the paper more rounded though</li>
      <li>love this, works just a described.</li>
      <li>I am a makeup artist and Ive used this for many shoots where I have had to make custom tattoos</li>
      <li>They look pretty good; closely cut images work better than script, as the outer edges of the tattoo are more noticeable around letters.</li>
      <li>worked pretty good for my kaepernick tattoos for Halloween.</li>
      <li>With the help of my talented roommate, I was able to make Lucy&#x27;s Tattoo look more realistic.  </li>
      <li>And the tattoos actually look very good on the skin as well.  </li>
      <li>Really gotta use some elbow grease to get it off your skin though which I guess is a good thing</li>
      <li>Alright these are so cool!</li>
      <li>purchased thinking I could easily print at home and</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>product was easy to use.</li>
      <li>worked and easy to use with help from some of the reader comments on shortcuts.</li>
      <li>adhesive was easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>These were so easy to use and apply.</li>
      <li>and there is nothing better, super easy to use and does not rub off,</li>
      <li>pack only comes with two sheets, and it&#x27;s also pretty pricey at about $4-$5 a sheet, but these seem to be the best choice offered on Amazon, and they work well.</li>
      <li>BUT these look more realistic, clean off better, and are customizable so they are just way better then your run of the mill</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it as a mockup for a future permanent tattoo, and it works great.</li>
      <li>I think our guests will still enjoy them.</li>
      <li>used my ordinary printer and they looked awesome!</li>
      <li>Lot&#x27;s of fun and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Special equipment NOT needed.  </li>
      <li>Contrary to the instructions, you don&#x27;t need any special tools, just an inkjet printer, a ruler or credit card, and scissors or hobby knife.</li>
      <li>and I was able to peal the whole thing off in one piece.</li>
      <li>The gloss issue noted by others is true.</li>
      <li>A quick child can easily disappear from even the most diligent adult.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to make temporary tattoos with this paper.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want the tattoo for more than a day, so I was easily able to get it off with soap and water, although the adhesive was pretty hardy and took a couple washings to come completely off.</li>
      <li>When you are ready to get tatted, make sure your skin is clean and free of oils or sweat (don&#x27;t be nervous, it&#x27;s not going to hurt like a real tattoo).</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really last more than 1 shower for me because the top layer peeled off and just exposed the sticky layer that the ink was attached to.</li>
      <li>Lovely for parties and even for adults wanting to try out a new design.</li>
      <li>At less than 6 cents per tattoo, I am extremely happy with my purchase and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first tattoo I applied didn&#x27;t stick entirety, which didn&#x27;t look very nice, but haven&#x27;t had issues with the other three I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>The tattoo paper sticks really well..great for parties or special occasions.  </li>
      <li>I could first before printing...</li>
      <li>Each pack has 2 sheets, so there are 4 sheets in total, so since everything went well, I still have 3 more sheets.</li>
      <li>They look pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>We will most definitely be buying this product again very soon!</li>
      <li>they prints better on flat paper.  </li>
      <li>The instructions for printing and transferring are pretty straight forward (pay attention to the fact that you need to flip your design before printing).</li>
      <li>I was participating in an obstacle course event with a large team.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use them with a cameo silhouette maker but they still turned out awesome with just normally cutting them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brand literally embeds to your skin and the tattoos look SO REAL.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I thank you so much.</li>
      <li>I designed something quickly in Microsoft PowerPoint using the freeform shapes tool, selected the whole thing, grouped it, reversed the image (flip horizontal), then duplicated it so there were multiple images on one sheet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was really awkward at the party when it worked best on pale skin tones and looked more plastic-y on darker skins.</li>
      <li>Definitely a little pricey for 2 pieces of paper but overall a really good product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also used by my roommate as she looks for a new tattoo to see where she wants to have it.  </li>
      <li>I know I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
      <li>inkjet photo printer set for high quality and glossy photo paper.</li>
      <li>high.</li>
      <li>I used baby powder to dull it down some, but as I was using this for a photo shoot, I found dulling spray worked perfectly to make it look real photographically, It also lasted long and was durable.</li>
      <li>Align and stick the adhesive layer on the tattoo paper, using your ruler, credit card, or any other hard-edged object to smooth out air</li>
      <li>As expensive as these papers are, I really expect good quality paper when I receive them.  </li>
      <li>My friend and I decided it would be fun tomake our own custom fake tattoos.  </li>
      <li>Take your time with wetting it down, it takes longer to have a clean image transfer.</li>
      <li>Would not suggest for movies or professional use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was impressed with this product. I made over 300 tattoos, roughly 1&amp;#34; wide and 3/2&amp;#34; high. I compiled the images in MS Word and printed them using an old (8 or 9 years) inkjet photo printer set for high quality and glossy photo paper. Applying the plastic over the printed tattoos was a breeze once I noticed the tab on the back to help with proper alignment and to reduce air bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tattoo I applied didn&#x27;t stick entirety, which didn&#x27;t look very nice, but haven&#x27;t had issues with the other three I&#x27;ve tried. They look pretty good; closely cut images work better than script, as the outer edges of the tattoo are more noticeable around letters. I&#x27;ve removed two with no difficulties. At less than 6 cents per tattoo, I am extremely happy with my purchase and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. It was delivered folded in half and creased so badly it couldnt be printed on properly. It was extremely expensive considering it didnt work. And it requires machinery, not just a home printer. Terrible.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly on my regular printer.  Made custom tattoos for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party.  Was very easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note:  I wanted 2 sheets total:  one for the party and one spare.  This is a 2 pack.  Each pack has 2 sheets, so there are 4 sheets in total, so since everything went well, I still have 3 more sheets.</li>
    <li> Wish I knew what Silhouette was when I ordered and that this paper must be used with the system (would have helped if the Silhouette name was TradeMarked as to represent the company).&lt;br /&gt;I purchased thinking I could easily print at home and that wasn&#x27;t the case.  Was worthless without Silouette</li>
    <li> I tried a couple of different products but found this the best appearing and easiest to use. The gloss issue noted by others is true. I used baby powder to dull it down some, but as I was using this for a photo shoot, I found dulling spray worked perfectly to make it look real photographically, It also lasted long and was durable. I didn&#x27;t want the tattoo for more than a day, so I was easily able to get it off with soap and water, although the adhesive was pretty hardy and took a couple washings to come completely off.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and Ive used this for many shoots where I have had to make custom tattoos and there is nothing better, super easy to use and does not rub off,</li>
    <li> literally the best and my favorite tattoo paper available. I&#x27;ve tried numerous different kinds and everything else looks fake and/or peels off like a sticker.  This brand literally embeds to your skin and the tattoos look SO REAL. I love, even at the price!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical because only two sheets are included but it worked perfectly for my daughters birthday party tatoos! Make sure to have your design correct before printing and enjoy!!</li>
    <li> These were a little expensive, but the quality was pretty good and my temporary tattoos printed and transferred well. I used these as nail decals actually.</li>
    <li> Got this for a party. Found the instructions very easy to follow - didn&#x27;t have any printing, smudging or adhesive problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was really awkward at the party when it worked best on pale skin tones and looked more plastic-y on darker skins. But plastic-y I mean there was no denying the adhesive, which looked opaque over the darker skin. We even cut really close to the design, but the inner negative spaces still looked plastic-y.</li>
    <li> So easy to replicate fake Halloween tattoos&#x3D; this would be a great party trick for a kids birthday! I didn&#x27;t have the Silhouette cutter/equipment. Just used an exacto knife to cut around the pieces. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I wish Amazon would NOT send them folded in half...they prints better on flat paper.  Had to flatten paper as best I could first before printing...adhesive was easy to use.  Fingers crossed on if they transfer good.</li>
    <li> The paper is too thick and doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.  I ended up using spirit gum to stick them on.</li>
    <li> Alright these are so cool! I didn&#x27;t use them with a cameo silhouette maker but they still turned out awesome with just normally cutting them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure of hos many would come with this but I got 2 packs with 2 sheets in each (so 4 sheets total.) And that was plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I printed out my own tattoos for a photo shoot I was doing and the application was so easy. They could be peeled off a few hours after application or washed off a few days later (sort of like a normal temporary tattoo.) BUT these look more realistic, clean off better, and are customizable so they are just way better then your run of the mill temporary tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my ordinary printer and they looked awesome! So pleased and I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> The plastic that has the tattoo on it is way too thick and does not sit evenly on the skin. In fact did not stick well enough to even keep on. I pulled it off and tried again with the others I printed out with no luck.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for very temporary tattoos. The only issue is for larger temp tattoos, depending on the area tattooed, the protective layer that keeps the ink in wrinkles. It didn&#x27;t really last more than 1 shower for me because the top layer peeled off and just exposed the sticky layer that the ink was attached to.</li>
    <li> I prefer to design my own tattoos before having them permanently inked on my body. Having the ability to print a temporary version to give it a test run allows me to make adjustments as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product. The instructions for printing and transferring are pretty straight forward (pay attention to the fact that you need to flip your design before printing). However, there is no margin for error when adhering the plastic transfer sheet on top of your printed design. So be extremely careful and patient or don&#x27;t print our designs to the very edge of the sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do look plastic and wrinkly, but that is the nature of temporary tattoos. They wash off easily in the shower - mine lasted only one day, which was a little disappointing, and left a dark residue.  Initially thought I had somehow given myself a bruise there.  A little baby oil was all that was needed to quickly clean it up.  I have used a similar product from an online tattoo site and while the tattoos last a little bit longer, they don&#x27;t completely come off as easily as the Silhoutte brand does. It was also almost twice the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silhouette recommends the purchase of their electronic cutting tool.  Unless you are mass producing temporary tattoo for an event, I see no reason to invest in this product. With a little patience and some small, sharp scissors you will have no need for that added expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An earlier reviewer mentioned an excellent idea to use these on children for identification purposes when on vacation, visiting attractions or even just taking a trip to the mall.  A quick child can easily disappear from even the most diligent adult. This is something I will be definitely be using for my grandson. I am not sure how well it would hold up at a water park or beach though.</li>
    <li> The tats I made myself using this paper were even better than store-bought tats. I made black &amp; white tats of Marijuana leaves, dragons, &amp;#34;Thug Life&amp;#34;, and others. Flawless.</li>
    <li> Great for making your own customized tattoos! Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The tattoo paper worked perfectly.  Special equipment NOT needed.  Definitely a little pricey for 2 pieces of paper but overall a really good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to make temporary tattoos with this paper.  I found it no problem with only a little practice.  And the tattoos actually look very good on the skin as well.  My only (minor) gripe is that the tattoos feel a little awkward on the skin, but that might be just temporary tattoos in general.</li>
    <li> These were so easy to use and apply. They look pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to trim the paper more rounded though, I cut mine in a square and one corner lifted and I was able to peal the whole thing off in one piece. I could have ignored it and it probably would have lasted a while.&lt;br /&gt;It did wrinkle quite a bit, which is something I was hoping to avoid with this product, but that&#x27;s not a huge deal. But if I had known, I would have just ordered one of the cheaper options.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they will work for what we wanted. We are using custom tattoos as favors for our wedding. I think our guests will still enjoy them.</li>
    <li> I love this tattoo paper. Unlike some other cheaper paper, it stays on the skin until washed wih soap. It&#x27;s great for kids of all ages, and the printing works great even with my very inexpensive inkjet printer.</li>
    <li> After looking at all the horrible reviews on other printable temporary tattoo papers here on Amazon, I decided to settle on Silhouette&#x27;s, even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey. I&#x27;m using it as a mockup for a future permanent tattoo, and it works great. Contrary to the instructions, you don&#x27;t need any special tools, just an inkjet printer, a ruler or credit card, and scissors or hobby knife. The process is simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Reverse your design and print it on the tattoo paper, since you&#x27;ll be applying the tattoo paper printed-side down on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) Align and stick the adhesive layer on the tattoo paper, using your ruler, credit card, or any other hard-edged object to smooth out air bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;3) Remove the plastic layer and apply it like any other temporary tattoo, using a damp towel, ice cube, or plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of the tattoos after you stick them on your skin, but it seems like it would last about as long as any other typical temporary tattoo, so don&#x27;t expect much more than a day of use before it starts to peel and rub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each pack only comes with two sheets, and it&#x27;s also pretty pricey at about $4-$5 a sheet, but these seem to be the best choice offered on Amazon, and they work well.</li>
    <li> Silhouette Temporary Tattoo paper is great for designing a tattoo, checking to see if you like the changes, size. It&#x27;s great for kids, too. No harmful inks or chemicals.</li>
    <li> I bought this to print out a tattoo concept and it worked great! The film is thicker than most. Take your time with wetting it down, it takes longer to have a clean image transfer. Use photo software to get the most images per page.</li>
    <li> A bit of a pain, did lead to tears, probably not entirely this specific brand of tattoo paper&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> worked and easy to use with help from some of the reader comments on shortcuts.</li>
    <li> This was fantastic!!!  I used it to make Fairy Tail Guild marks for myself and a few friends who were also cosplaying from the show.  With the help of my talented roommate, I was able to make Lucy&#x27;s Tattoo look more realistic.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t last past the first shower after wearing it, but that probably has to do with the fact that I had it on my hand.  I know I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more in the future.  It&#x27;s also used by my roommate as she looks for a new tattoo to see where she wants to have it.  I can&#x27;t wait for my next project that will use this!!!</li>
    <li> This tattoo paper is wonderful, high-durability, and transfers well. The best of its kind! Lovely for parties and even for adults wanting to try out a new design. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My friend and I decided it would be fun tomake our own custom fake tattoos.  We ordered this 2 pack and had 2 sheets each which was plenty. We had no issues with the process at all and we simply used Microsoft word to do the printing and they turned out great! The directions were very clear and simple . We will most definitely be buying this product again very soon!</li>
    <li> I was participating in an obstacle course event with a large team. Many people were concerned that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut it, so as team captain, I needed something to boost their confidence. What could be better for making yourself tough than getting a tattoo? This paper helped achieve this result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was easy to use. Select or create an image. For maximum toughness results, use something with flames and barbed wire. I designed something quickly in Microsoft PowerPoint using the freeform shapes tool, selected the whole thing, grouped it, reversed the image (flip horizontal), then duplicated it so there were multiple images on one sheet. Use an inkjet printer to print it on this paper, and and then apply the adhesive sheet carefully (I used a ruler to squeeze out air bubbles). Cut your tattoos out, staying close to the design shape. When you are ready to get tatted, make sure your skin is clean and free of oils or sweat (don&#x27;t be nervous, it&#x27;s not going to hurt like a real tattoo). After applying, I could feel the tattoo&#x27;s tough-making abilities take effect immediately. It felt thicker than commercial temporary tattoos, but at least I was tough. When I was done (office day job, you know), I peeled it off carefully starting at the edges. You can also scrub the tattoo off with a rag and soapy water.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use</li>
    <li> worked pretty good for my kaepernick tattoos for Halloween. Really gotta use some elbow grease to get it off your skin though which I guess is a good thing</li>
    <li> Used to transfer images to wood. Worked beautifully and made some great Christmas presents. A little pricey bit totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I like using this product, but on my last order over half of the papers were damaged.  As expensive as these papers are, I really expect good quality paper when I receive them.  The packaging was excellent so I feel the papers were already damaged before packaging.   A lot of the top sheets had bubbles in them.  Some had hard bends in the papers like something heavy had been dropped on them.  I was very disappointed when I received my last order.</li>
    <li> these don&#x27;t work at all in a laser printer</li>
    <li> love this, works just a described. it&#x27;s a lot of fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip: you don&#x27;t need to install any of their software. i decided on my tattoos and put them in photoshop PDF then simply printed. don&#x27;t waste time installing all the stuff if you have a .pdf or .doc file you want to print out.</li>
    <li> They worked out awesome. I used them for a military wives event at FE Warren AFB. I thank you so much.</li>
    <li> The tattoo paper sticks really well..great for parties or special occasions.  Would not suggest for movies or professional use.</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of fun and easy to use. Worked well for the photo shoot we used them for.</li>
    <li> Easy to work with, makes great party favors!</li>
    <li> Hard to put the backing on straight once the tattoos are printed</li>
