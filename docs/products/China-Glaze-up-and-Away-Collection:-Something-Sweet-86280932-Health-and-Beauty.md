      <li>It is a very soft pink and lasted me 5 days which is great for any nail polish if you wash your hands a lot.</li>

    <li> Fun and cute pink. Looked just the way I thought it would. You do have to do 2-3 coats to get the color even, but other than that its great!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of a Youtube reccommendation, and it was a lovely color. However I find that applying it without streaks is IMPOSSIBLE! The only other option is to glop it on, and then when it dries it peels. The one time I managed to get it on without gross streaks though, it stayed on forever. I wish the application wasn&#x27;t so touchy, cause I loved the color and staying power.</li>
    <li> All Time favorite polish, nice &amp; suttle</li>
    <li> I loved the color of this nail polish and was excited to find it on Amazon.  The color is a very soft, subtle pink and is perfect for spring/Easter.      The only complaint that I have is that the color chips off pretty fast.  I put on 2 coats and a clear top coat. I noticed that the polish was chipping pretty bad by the end of the second day.      This was my first experience with China Glaze and maybe the polishes are all like this.  They have really nice colors  so I might try a couple more and see if the results are similar.  Probably buffing my nails before applying the color would have helped but I always feel strange doing that because my nails are flimsy enough as it is.</li>
    <li> i like it i love it i want some more of it i try so hard just to get to 17 words...</li>
    <li> For people who have nails that crack peel works great just have to get past the color again looks better in picture by far.</li>
    <li> I use all China Glaze products and am very pleased with how they wear.  This color I did not like for me.  It was an iridescent shade not the pale pink I thought it was.</li>
    <li> Love this color and it does not leave streaks. Its very natural but flirty. This is definitely a must have!</li>
    <li> Very nice creme nail polish. Love it! Goes on nice and thick. Perfect for a quick manicure! But I thought it would be a little more light.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Must buy! It&#x27;s the perfect density, color, thickness, texture. It&#x27;s not a super fast drying nail polish though!</li>
    <li> Kind of watery defiantly two/three coats! The color is as pastel as I wanted but a base coat may be helpful.</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely wonderful.  You can use it for any outfit.  I love that you can use it almost all year round.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is a pretty. I was a bit suprised at how light pink it was though, it&#x27;s very washed out, which is not necessarily a bad thing because it&#x27;s still a beautiful shade. However, the application of this polish was more difficult than the usual China Glaze polishes. It was very streaky. The best way to apply this polish is to use thin a thin coat, wait until that coat dries (which shouldn&#x27;t be long with it being so thin), and apply another thin coat, and so on until you have an even finish. I find that easier than trying to apply thick coats to get full coverage because it can be messy, it takes longer to dry, and it will be more susceptible to peeling later on.</li>
    <li> Ive gotten so many compliments from this color choice. Its hard to find the perfect shade of pinkband ive definitely found it with china glazes &amp;#34;something sweet&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, great product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this as manicure tips, and full color. Light and a nice touch of pink without being overwhelming</li>
    <li> This item are perfect for a Baby Shower gifts my daughter love the color and everyone love it too perfect for a git.</li>
    <li> Was going to give for Christmas but I can&#x27;t now, because it&#x27;s still not here !! So madd !! Ugh I really wanted this for a friend but now they are going to think I forgot about them. This is one of the down falls of ordering online.</li>
    <li> The only thing is that it chips easily, so a clear top coat would help it.&lt;br /&gt;The pink is almost a natural pink but a bit cuter</li>
    <li> The color is pretty but you may have to apply about two to three coats to get this color.  Really not a bad deal</li>
    <li> This color is so pretty.  I ordered it for my daughter after an in-store search failed to produce this color. The wear is super!  No chips, no top coat applied and it still looks great.  It also was delivered the day BEFORE the estimated shipment arrival date so that was super fast! Even with the shipping, the price was awesome.</li>
    <li> I needed a light pink and this one does the job. Goes on thick but not clumpy, only 1 or 2 coats needed. Happy with this :) Worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this color because its in my opinion a nude pink. Its a classic color that isn&#x27;t too bold or anything.</li>
    <li> Simply beautiful!  Strangely suits quite a few skin colors. My daughter in laws very fair and I&#x27;m dark brown.... Suits us both!</li>
    <li> When you want to wear a subtle, soft pink Something Sweet is the way to go. It&#x27;s not a shocking, hot, I&#x27;m wearing pink polish kind of pink. This pink is lighter than it appears in the bottle.  It&#x27;s not a shocking, hot, I&#x27;m wearing pink polish kind of pink.  Opaque: one thick coat or two thin coats is all you need.  This polish gives professional looking results, no streaks. This polish can be used alone, with a coat of glitter for a magical affect, or even for a French manicure. I love it. If you love polish, don&#x27;t hesitate to add this color to collection.  It&#x27;s a fabulous every day polish.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite nail polishes as it goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t chip and stays on!  The color is a great light pink for any of you pink lovers. Would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Along with blue it&#x27;s not easy to find the right shade of pink. Something not too bright or dull. Something Sweet is the perfect pale pink and I have worn it already 3 times. Once alone and twice as a base with a fancy glaze over it. Looked great every time. I really love China Glaze.</li>
    <li> This product has a great color. It is a very soft pink and lasted me 5 days which is great for any nail polish if you wash your hands a lot.</li>
    <li> It was very difficult to put on-very streaky.  It looked horrible.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with Sally Hansen from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this brand!  I discovered it on here, and this is the 3rd color I have ordered.  It covers very smoothly, either in one thick coat, or 2 thin ones.  It doesn&#x27;t easily chip once it is hard, and it makes my stubby nails look fabulous!</li>
    <li> I love this baby pink nail polish, it has a light purple undertone. you may need 3 coats to make an opaque color. It is beautiful.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had this polish and I loved it. But once I got mine I was surprised by how thick it was. While it goes on great, one coat is almost enough and two coats is too much... But I do love the color</li>
    <li> It is not too thick nor thin, and great color payoff. I didn&#x27;t apply a basecoat because I could not find it so I did three coats with this. I normally use a white basecoat for colors like this that might need three coats. I love the color, and have this color on as I type this. I like this company because they didn&#x27;t test on animals the last time I checked, but who knows by now. I will get more colors from this brand.</li>
    <li> Delivery was slow but did make it before Christmas. Color is nice. This was a gift for my daughter. She lives it</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this color. It&#x27;s the perfect baby pink. However this polish lasted me about 2 days of wear, and that is with a top coat. It just doesn&#x27;t have the staying power that some of the other polishes have.</li>
    <li> polish is a very pretty pastel pink but it chips very easily. I like to put a white coat of polish underneath just to make the color pop.</li>
    <li> I love the color it is such a beautiful pale pink and only requires two coats for me. The downfall is after only a couple uses it gets sooo clumpy! I almost am considering throwing it out because now it&#x27;s almost unusable. I would suggest finding another brands polish of a color similar to this because it really is such a shame for such a pretty polish.</li>
    <li> Great polish, a beautiful color! I just love it. Goes on really well and dries fast. I have yet to be unhappy with a China Glaze.</li>
    <li> This color is a very subtle color. It&#x27;s a baby pink, but it&#x27;s so pretty. I wear it quite a lot. It&#x27;s my go-to color.</li>
    <li> Pink, almost lavender-y color. Does well for springtime or background to nail art. Goes on smoothly and usually done in 1-2 coats, typical China Glaze</li>
    <li> This shade of polish allows me to still be able to wear any color clothing &amp; it&#x27;s pretty on my mocha skin tone. Thanks China Glaze!</li>
    <li> I bought this polish because earlier I got my pedicure done at a salon in this particular color and I loved it. I was under the impression that this polish would be the same shade as my pedicure, but this is a lot pinker. It&#x27;s comparable to a \\&quot;cotton candy pink\\&quot; like what another reviewer said. The &#x27;Something Sweet&#x27; that the salon used (3 coats) was a muted pink with a purple tinge. I applied 2 coats of this polish on one of my fingers and compared it to my toes and it&#x27;s not even close. It&#x27;s still a nice color but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I just received my nail polish today and it&#x27;s so cute I&#x27;m in love with this color!!! I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> It took a week to get home but once it did its great its girly, cute pastel color im really happy</li>
    <li> I really like this color. Its a nice light pink for spring but it may look a bit young on some people.</li>
    <li> China glaze is the way to go!! Love everything about these products, I love the selection of colors and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t wear off!</li>
