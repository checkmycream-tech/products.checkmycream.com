      <li>And I bought it, and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>This particular soap is nice, and smells great while keeping your hands soft and feeling smooth.  </li>
      <li>Ironically, I get to use these wonderful little pouches after shoving my grubby hands into that greasy eco-friendly chip bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>o&#x27; soap is a practical, cost-effective way of keeping all the soap dispensers filled around the house.  </li>
      <li>Really enjoy this soap.  </li>
      <li>We have a combination of decorative soap dispensers that we re-fill, and the original bottles this product came in, which also can be refilled.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for something ecologically friendly in the liquid soap line for quite some time.  </li>
      <li>We love this soap - a nice, light fragrance that is pleasant, and the form factor of the refill is great - no mess, low waste.  </li>
      <li>It has a lovely scent and gentle on your hands.</li>
      <li>Such a good value for the money, and</li>
      <li>Still, I&#x27;m pleased with this Dial refill and love its current packaging!</li>
      <li>Thanks for a fine product</li>
      <li>Fine product, used by entire family, inexpensive and cleans without odors often associated antibacterial hand-soaps,  Augmented by pleasant and healthy additives for creating a more robust cleansing, something the entire family appreciates when using regularly.</li>
      <li>Smells great and helps keep my constantly washed hands soft.</li>
      <li>Choose the right one for your preference.</li>
      <li>This refill is inexpensive, easy to handle and dispense with no mess, and it smells really fresh without being perfumey.</li>
      <li>The product is as described and I like using it very much.  </li>
      <li>Love this soap and the White Tea &amp; Vitamin E smell.  </li>
      <li>So I decided to try the White Tea &amp; Vitamin E version to see if it was more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll have to see if it helps over the long term, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>be aware that this comes in both antibacterial and non-antibacterial forms.  </li>
      <li>Great for cleaning messy hands while keeping them soft and not drying them out.</li>
      <li>The foam, which has a subtle pleasant fragrance, really cleans your hands well, and rinses off quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure when the Universe was in its infancy this soap was actually the soap that the Old Gods used in their bathhouse orgy culture.</li>
      <li>I really recommend these over the large plastic bottles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use because you can squeeze the bag to move the soap along.</li>
      <li>a very inexpensive and cheaper way to purchase soap refills.  </li>
      <li>you need to warsh it to get it really clean!&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very convenient to refill dispensers when I run out.</li>
      <li>Much easier to fill dispensers without spills.</li>
      <li>Finally, a refill that is prepackaged in an easily collapsible soft plastic pouch-like container.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled not to have to purchase the large hard plastic bottles anymore.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dial Antibacterial liquid soaps for years, primarily the Spring Water scent, but I found my hands getting  dry.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These refill bags are great--the more you use, the less room they take up, and they don&#x27;t take up a ton of room in the trash/recycling bin, either.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It was kind of hard to hold they refill bag</li>
      <li>I bought this along with a new foam pump.</li>
      <li>These take up far less room, are easy to use with no spilling or mess, and easy to dispose of.  </li>
      <li>I love the twist off cap--it makes it easy to pour and creates less of a mess than the big, bulky refill bottles.</li>
      <li>i love that its dial which is hard to find in the store and 2.</li>
      <li>Overall, I really like this product  </li>
      <li>The spout on the bag works better than I expected, and I actually had an easier time refilling my kitchen dispenser with this bag &amp; spout than I have with the big jugs of liquid hand</li>
      <li>nothing beats having clean hands and saving the environment a little.  </li>
      <li>this has a soft plastic bag and a short nozzle type opening which allows you to fit it into the smaller bottle and have all the soap go into the bottle instead of running down the sides</li>
      <li>pouch is easy to pour from, uses less material, and can be squeezed flat and rolled like a toothpaste tube to get every last drop (don&#x27;t act like you don&#x27;t do it!).  </li>
      <li>The soap itself is of the same quality you get in the individual bottles, but far cheaper by the ounce when bought in bulk.  </li>

<li> I also appreciate the flexible packaging which contains 67% less plastic yet, still stands up.</li>
<li> /&gt;The smell is a little stronger than I would like, but I prefer no scent at all, so take that with a grain of proverbial salt.  </li>

    <li> Effective hand cleanser and nice fragrance.  I like the packaging as well and it is easy to fill the bottles.</li>
    <li> Easy to pour and smells okay. Good price</li>
    <li> nothing beats having clean hands and saving the environment a little.  I have the small dispenser and refuse to get replacement. Ones when getting this pack is easier and more eco-friendly</li>
    <li> This hand soap is the one we use most--I get these refills and fill our dispensers with it. It cleans well and also rinses off well. I love the smell--it&#x27;s light, but it smells so nice and refreshing. I&#x27;ll continue to use this soap for years to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These refill bags are great--the more you use, the less room they take up, and they don&#x27;t take up a ton of room in the trash/recycling bin, either. I love the twist off cap--it makes it easy to pour and creates less of a mess than the big, bulky refill bottles.</li>
    <li> This is a great option for saving money and resources. I highly recommend it. More words...more words..more words. Ha, just buy it.</li>
    <li> I was told that &amp;#34;it&#x27;s still dirty if you simply washed it... you need to warsh it to get it really clean!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing this stuff may warsh my hands...</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly. I mainly ordered it because I wanted a clear hand soap, which is surprisingly hard to find. This fit the bill and smells great too.  a</li>
    <li> Great smell, great package. Super easy and convenient! Especially for travel!!</li>
    <li> Love the product!! Great for cleaning messy hands while keeping them soft and not drying them out. No worries when sick knowing this product is also cleaning the germs.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a new foam pump. It is heavenly! Smells great and helps keep my constantly washed hands soft.</li>
    <li> I hate buying new handsoap bottles.  I use it in decorative pumps at my kitchen and bathroom sinks.  This refill is inexpensive, easy to handle and dispense with no mess, and it smells really fresh without being perfumey.</li>
    <li> Such a good value for the money, and I feel better about the amount of garbage I&#x27;m generating. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Love that Dial is thinking of reducing and made this pourable pouch.</li>
    <li> great way to fill soap dispensers with the spout and the bag, those bottles are a pain in the neck!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that there is no plastic jug to clutter up the landfills. However, still worry about the &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; as I hear negatives...  We only use in the kitchen with food prep, etc.</li>
    <li> This sack o&#x27; soap is a practical, cost-effective way of keeping all the soap dispensers filled around the house.  The soap itself is of the same quality you get in the individual bottles, but far cheaper by the ounce when bought in bulk.  We have a combination of decorative soap dispensers that we re-fill, and the original bottles this product came in, which also can be refilled.</li>
    <li> These refills are so easy to use. The product is great and the seller is excellent.</li>
    <li> Terrific product.  The foam, which has a subtle pleasant fragrance, really cleans your hands well, and rinses off quickly.  Much better than a slippery bar and sticky soap dish!  I also appreciate the flexible packaging which contains 67% less plastic yet, still stands up.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this refill in stores and no one has it. We like this scent but don&#x27;t want to keep buying the small bottles.</li>
    <li> This Dial formula, for some reason I can&#x27;t figure out from the label, is the easiest on my skin during dry winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a non-antibacterial version, or even maybe a probiotic version.  But whatever they&#x27;ve put together here, it does not rip my skin the way all their other formulations do.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something ecologically friendly in the liquid soap line for quite some time.  Finally, a refill that is prepackaged in an easily collapsible soft plastic pouch-like container. I&#x27;m thrilled not to have to purchase the large hard plastic bottles anymore.

    <li> The product is as described and I like using it very much.  Pleasant, not overpowering scent and it flows easily into my dispenser.  I will buy it again when this is gone.</li>
    <li> Love this soap and the White Tea &amp; Vitamin E smell.  It&#x27;s getting hard to find in the stores anymore.  I bought this big refiller, but I did think it was quite expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the White Tea &amp; Vitamin E hand soap but was unable to find it in my stores locally anymore except for in the small bottle size. This is just a better investment, more for your money. It has a lovely scent and gentle on your hands. That&#x27;s why I buy it.</li>
    <li> Love that it has a spout to easily refill a soap dispenser. Smells really nice too. I will def be ordering more bc 1. i love that its dial which is hard to find in the store and 2. did i mention the spout? love it.</li>
    <li> I had my last 2 for over a year...a very inexpensive and cheaper way to purchase soap refills.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This packaging is ingenious!  It&#x27;s hard to believe that I found this on the market AFTER those obnoxiously loud chip bags that used less material.  Ironically, I get to use these wonderful little pouches after shoving my grubby hands into that greasy eco-friendly chip bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch is easy to pour from, uses less material, and can be squeezed flat and rolled like a toothpaste tube to get every last drop (don&#x27;t act like you don&#x27;t do it!).  No more propping it upside down for an hour and watching the little drizzles get to the cap so you can refill your dispenser.  This particular soap is nice, and smells great while keeping your hands soft and feeling smooth.  It seems to help my hands a lot in the dry winter months..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done, Dial!</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this soap.  It doesn&#x27;t activate my allergies.  Yippee!  Also doesn&#x27;t leave a scum in the shower, or on me.</li>
    <li> We love this soap - a nice, light fragrance that is pleasant, and the form factor of the refill is great - no mess, low waste.  Much easier to refill than a hard plastic bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s getting harder to find this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be aware that this comes in both antibacterial and non-antibacterial forms.

    <li> I was just thinking, &amp;#34;Man, why don&#x27;t they sell this stuff in a package that&#x27;s more environmentally friendly?&amp;#34;  And then I saw this.  And I bought it, and it&#x27;s fine.  I used it to refill my own dispensers.  The spout on the bag works better than I expected, and I actually had an easier time refilling my kitchen dispenser with this bag &amp; spout than I have with the big jugs of liquid hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little stronger than I would like, but I prefer no scent at all, so take that with a grain of proverbial salt.  It&#x27;s not over powering or unpleasant, I would just prefer it not be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more of these when I run out.</li>
    <li> Fine product, used by entire family, inexpensive and cleans without odors often associated antibacterial hand-soaps,  Augmented by pleasant and healthy additives for creating a more robust cleansing, something the entire family appreciates when using regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this a couple of times now. The scent is pleasant, I like that it&#x27;s antibacterial, and it&#x27;s really easy to pour into my hand soap dispensers. I also like that the packaging is more compact and environmentally friendly.</li>
    <li> I like this liquid Dial soap and it smells really good. I am still using this same purchase. I like the packaging, too. It&#x27;s flexible and if you&#x27;re like me, you can squeeze it to get the &amp;#34;very last drop&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Dial is a product with a long history of cleaning me up.  So a antibacterial hand cleaner has to bebop good to uphol d the dial name.  And it did.  No complaints here.  Well, one small one.  It was kind of hard to hold they refill bag (I needed two hands.  I also needed a hand to hold the soap dispenser.  I think though that as I do it more often I will become more adept and be better able to accomplish the task.  Thanks for a fine product</li>
    <li> Bought this as a foaming hand soap replacement, I must have read the description wrong?  I&#x27;ll keep for non-foaming hand soap dispensers.</li>
    <li> I really recommend these over the large plastic bottles. Much easier to fill dispensers without spills.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dial Antibacterial liquid soaps for years, primarily the Spring Water scent, but I found my hands getting  dry. So I decided to try the White Tea &amp; Vitamin E version to see if it was more moisturizing. I just started using it so I&#x27;ll have to see if it helps over the long term, but so far so good. It has a very nice scent, light with a hint of coconut and it&#x27;s still antibacterial.&lt;br /&gt;A really great feature of this product is its packaging. Instead of the hard plastic bottles usually used for liquid soaps this has a soft plastic bag and a short nozzle type opening which allows you to fit it into the smaller bottle and have all the soap go into the bottle instead of running down the sides so you don&#x27;t  waste soap. It&#x27;s much easier to use because you can squeeze the bag to move the soap along. Overall, I really like this product  and I plan to order more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure when the Universe was in its infancy this soap was actually the soap that the Old Gods used in their bathhouse orgy culture.</li>
