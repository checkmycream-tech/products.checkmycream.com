      <li>Great to calm your dogs (put just a drop on their head), and also wonderful to use on their ear issues (use sparingly!)</li>
      <li>I really love this combo and will purchase again!</li>
      <li>I am so glad that Desert Essence decided to combine lavender oil with tea tree!</li>
      <li>I saw this combo and figured why not, both EO are amazing</li>
      <li>It does have a very strong herbal odor, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
      <li>Good antibacterial for gap between tooth and gum with use of fine proxy brush.</li>
      <li>I apply this twice a day to breakouts and love the smell.</li>
      <li>This is such great stuff!</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how many uses tree tea oil has-</li>
      <li>Love this combo - use it in the yoga class humidifiers at the Bikram Yoga Studio - I totally love this mixture</li>
      <li>love the scent.</li>
      <li>just seems to work better.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m sure some may find it a bit overpowering.</li>
      <li>Very happy with Amazon and will only buy this way.</li>
      <li>I used to get the oils form a local Health food store but paid so much more than on amazon!!!</li>
      <li>I started stretching and have issues with the holes getting infected and this is a natural antiseptic that works great if you happen to be gauging your ears.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the smell- very clean scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is relaxing as well, and does not overwhelm your nose with a strong odor.</li>
      <li>Even with a strong herbal odor, it&#x27;s well worth it for the benefits of clearer skin!</li>
      <li>This is a great organic essential oil.</li>
      <li>And adding some drops to a spray bottle filled with water helps sooth my dogs flea bites and shoos them away.</li>
      <li>This oil is such a good price and lasts for ever and smells lovely.</li>
      <li>It does nothing special.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>My skin has significantly cleared and also seems, when I do get pimples, to heal much faster than it did before I started using the oil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite first aid item in my medicine cabinet.</li>
      <li>The lavender really helps mellow the tea tree sting.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this oil combo.</li>
      <li>I got this oil for my face because I break out bad when i am streesed out and it worked great!</li>
      <li>I tried it out on three blemishes over the weekend and saw a large improvement in less than 8 hours.</li>

    <li> This is such great stuff! We cloth diaper our child and use it in the washes and soaks, I use it when making his wipe solution, and I even used it when little one had cradle cap. This oil is such a good price and lasts for ever and smells lovely. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product excellen price! Very happy with Amazon and will only buy this way. I used to get the oils form a local Health food store but paid so much more than on amazon!!! Will only buy this way now!</li>
    <li> To soon to tell.  love the scent.</li>
    <li> I use this with my apple cider vinegar hair mix. There are other uses for these oils, like cleaners and facial washes, but I haven&#x27;t tried these things yet. It lasts a long time as well since you only need a few drops and you have to dilute it with water. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Perfect blend of two great oils. I add this to all of my toddler&#x27;s baths. I also add a few drops to my homemade diaper wipe solution. Great idea to combine lavender and tea tree!</li>
    <li> This is a great organic essential oil. I dab a few drops and spread it on my face. If I need to relax I&#x27;ll rub a drop on my temples. And adding some drops to a spray bottle filled with water helps sooth my dogs flea bites and shoos them away.</li>
    <li> I bought this to fade dark spots. I don&#x27;t know if it works because I can&#x27;&#x27;t get past the smell. Even using very little gives me a head ache.</li>
    <li> Great to calm your dogs (put just a drop on their head), and also wonderful to use on their ear issues (use sparingly!)</li>
    <li> I put this oil on my face after I get out of the shower--just a couple of drops to apply to my forehead, chin, and nose--my problem areas. My skin has significantly cleared and also seems, when I do get pimples, to heal much faster than it did before I started using the oil. It does have a very strong herbal odor, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. Even with a strong herbal odor, it&#x27;s well worth it for the benefits of clearer skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blend of oils from Desert Essence for YEARS. It&#x27;s by far my favorite first aid item in my medicine cabinet. Tea Tree is antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral. Lavender is soothing and calming to the skin and scenses. It&#x27;s anti inflamitory, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal. I&#x27;ve use this on everything from minor cuts to acne to spider bites and staph infections (after seeing the dr of course). I&#x27;ve used other brands but something about this one just seems to work better. Big 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Good antibacterial for gap between tooth and gum with use of fine proxy brush. Removes the foul odor caused by liquid foods such as tea or coffee that seeps in the gap and can&#x27;t come out and cause decay.</li>
    <li> Love this combo - use it in the yoga class humidifiers at the Bikram Yoga Studio - I totally love this mixture</li>
    <li> I got this oil for my face because I break out bad when i am streesed out and it worked great!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how many uses tree tea oil has- add in the lavender and it adds a layer of soothing. We use this from everything from skin irritation, mosquito bites, blemish care, stinky feet, etc. I highly recommend this oil combo.</li>
    <li> I use this essential oil all the time. I especially like it to refresh my neck warmer. Great on pillows to help you sleep, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed. I don&#x27;t see a difference with this product. It does nothing special. Hyped up with no real results.</li>
    <li> I apply this twice a day to breakouts and love the smell. I use it undiluted though the instructions advise differently. It seems to help.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that Desert Essence decided to combine lavender oil with tea tree! It is a good product from a good seller!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This is great for my ear gauges. I started stretching and have issues with the holes getting infected and this is a natural antiseptic that works great if you happen to be gauging your ears. The scent is relaxing as well, and does not overwhelm your nose with a strong odor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes that it would help my acne. I usually use Tea Tree oil and found information stating how Lavender works as well. This product didn&#x27;t work for me but it may for someone else. Every body is different.</li>
    <li> I purchased this essential oil because I ran out of my usual tree tree. I saw this combo and figured why not, both EO are amazing and I have combined them in the past. I enjoy the smell- very clean scent. However, I&#x27;m sure some may find it a bit overpowering. I plan on using this on the dryer balls I&#x27;m making. I tried it out on three blemishes over the weekend and saw a large improvement in less than 8 hours. The lavender really helps mellow the tea tree sting. Conclusion: I really love this combo and will purchase again!</li>
