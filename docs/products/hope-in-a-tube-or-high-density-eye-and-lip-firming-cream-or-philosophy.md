      <li>Moisturizing, fills in the fine lines.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that my fine lines have diminished though.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;--spreads smoothly and evenly</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell a real difference, but nice smelling and hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to buy this at a reasonable price to try it out.</li>
      <li>Upon first application, I loved the smooth texture and how it made my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>After trying many eye creams, this one proves to be the absolute best, hands down!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t liked, for example, the HOPE in a jar, but this one is not stinky and comes out in a nice smooth small amount.</li>
      <li>A friend gave it to me for Christmas last year and it is an outstanding under eye and lip product!</li>
      <li>Put it on and it soaks right in.  </li>
      <li>Soaks right into the skin.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t be without it, since it does exactly what</li>
      <li>I started using Hope in  a Tube and at first burned my eyes.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time trying this companies products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Philosophy products, but Hope in a Tube has become a critical part of my daily make-up and nighttime routines.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the product until the fourth day, when I woke up to red, swollen patches under my eyes.</li>
      <li>The down side is ingredients are not all natural and it does have parabens which may not be good for you.</li>
      <li>It really moisturizes these areas i am noticing a difference.  </li>
      <li>Under eye dryness is moisturized very well with this cream.</li>
      <li>I have never seen an eye cream disappear so fast.  </li>
      <li>I will not be without this really works.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that just wants smoother, brighter looking skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I have used some higher end products, and they absorb well and the firming action is immediate!</li>
      <li>I dab it on very lightly and it absorbs very well, in a few minutes.</li>
      <li>I am sure this product will work wonders for many people, but unfortunately my face does not like something that&#x27;s in it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t use it  everyday, but still love it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s normal texture again.</li>
      <li>Eyes look fresh and dewy for several hours.</li>
      <li>Came on time and in new box too.</li>
      <li>but this product causes my eye area to form milia (tiny white bumps under the surface of the skin that form from using cheap ingredients</li>
      <li>I have used this cream on my eyes each morning for several years and really like it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 66 yrs old and eye area that of a 40 yr old.</li>
      <li>Seems to keep my lips and skin soft.</li>
      <li>Like most wrinkle-related products, I think you have to use them for a long time or stop using them to see an immediate difference (positive or negative).</li>
      <li>and this is the one product that, applied in the morning, makes the area around the eyes feel hydrated the whole day long, with no make-up caking right under the eyes, at the end of a very long day.</li>
      <li>I used Olay regenerist for a long time - but was not convinced it was really helping.  </li>
      <li>My original purchase was a small .5 oz from QVC.</li>
      <li>Very concentrated, you only need much less than a pearl size dot.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS VERY HARSH. TAKES SKIN OFF! BUYER BEWARE! I cannot believe this stuff is even on the market. Philosophy that is supposed to be the natural product selling harsh chemicals like this. Terrible!</li>
    <li> Great price and much cheaper than Sephora. Feels good around my eyes and is not greasy. Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this companies products. I was in the market for a \\&quot;GOOD\\&quot; eye cream. I am 46 and showing the signs of sun damage and ...UGH aging, I am still on the fence about this product. I have not had it long enough to see any results. I will say that it leaves the eye and lip area tacky to the touch. Not sure if I will continue to use this. I have used some higher end products, and they absorb well and the firming action is immediate! Will give another week. I will say buy from a good dealer, mine came with no packaging, which scares me. I still have to address that with the seller. Bottom line...Would not recommend at this time. I will update if it starts to work.[[ASIN:B001AH8PZY philosophy hope in a tube, eye and lip firming cream .5 oz (14.2 g)]]</li>
    <li> Just another cream to get people to spend money on.....can&#x27;t believe I keep getting sucked in.</li>
    <li> Great product w/a super great price, and quick delivery!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Philosophy products, but Hope in a Tube has become a critical part of my daily make-up and nighttime routines.  It truly helps the lines around your eye and mouth areas become less noticeable.  If you&#x27;ve ever thought about trying this - don&#x27;t hesitate - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good delivery turn around.</li>
    <li> I have never seen an eye cream disappear so fast.  Put it on and it soaks right in.  Give this a try and you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Love the Philosophy Hope in a Tube Eye Cream.  Best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.[[ASIN:B001AH8PZY Philosophy Hope in a Tube Eye and Lip Contour Cream Tube, 0.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I have been using Philosophy for awhile and my eyes lids have been very dry and wrinkly looking.  I started using Hope in  a Tube and at first burned my eyes.  I have been using it at night and in the morning now for about a month and see a big difference in the way my eyeliner goes on and stays on.  My eyes are a lot brighter and smoother.  I would recommend this product to anyone that just wants smoother, brighter looking skin.</li>
    <li> I will not be without this really works. I am 55 and keep this in stock at all times. Alittle pricey but with prime I do not pay for shipping. So it is cheaper than QVC</li>
    <li> This miracle cream has worked wonders for my dark circle under my eyes. I bought this product on a whim and Im happy with the results. Ill definitely recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> Due to the material quality，the cream is not easy to spread on your eyes，especially when ur eyes&#x27; circum skin are wet by putting on the toner or lotion.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to help with upper lip lines and see a very slight improvement after a month so think I need to try another product.</li>
    <li> My original purchase was a small .5 oz from QVC. Got me hooked. I&#x27;m 66 yrs old and eye area that of a 40 yr old. Makes ME happy and I&#x27;ll keep using till I either die or they don&#x27;t make it anymore, whichever comes first !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell a real difference, but nice smelling and hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out. Like most wrinkle-related products, I think you have to use them for a long time or stop using them to see an immediate difference (positive or negative).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go a day without it.  I put my concealer on over the Hope in a Tube.  Dab and press cream under eye.</li>
    <li> I love this product and am heartbroken that Philosophy discontinued it.  One of the only &#x27;must have&#x27; beauty products that I use.</li>
    <li> My wife has loved this from the start.  She finds some of the other products have changed.  Glad this hasn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I liked the way it penetrates the skin around the eyes and mouth.  It&#x27;s not too greasy and it moisturizes nicely.</li>
    <li> tiny amount in tube.  not very effective</li>
    <li> 10 stars for this product!!  I use alot of this, the only issue I have is that if I use it liberally, which helps, my eye makeup smudges, even the waterproof stuff, and even if I use it the night before. So I don&#x27;t use it  everyday, but still love it</li>
    <li> love this product!  i have tried many products for fine lines around my lips and eyes and this one is by far the best I have found.  It really moisturizes these areas i am noticing a difference.  This has officially been added to my beauty routine!</li>
    <li> Best eye creme I have used! A little bit goes a long way. I have tried many and this one works.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy product but alas this one doesn&#x27;t do a thing for me. I love how it feels and that makes me feel good. Maybe it&#x27;s too late for me. Came on time and in new box too.</li>
    <li> A friend gave it to me for Christmas last year and it is an outstanding under eye and lip product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, love it. Moisturizing, fills in the fine lines. The down side is ingredients are not all natural and it does have parabens which may not be good for you. Pricey but cheaper here on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream on my eyes each morning for several years and really like it. I dab it on very lightly and it absorbs very well, in a few minutes. It&#x27;s a bit expensive but lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I use this on my upper lip to help with the little lines that form  as we get older. I have never found anything else that works as well as this Philosophy product!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave home without it. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Buyers be aware - the description is wrong - this is 0.25oz cream, not 0.5oz as advertised by seller!</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used! It goes on perfectly and keeps moisterizing beatifully.Mostly,it works---you can see the difference--try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love Philosophy!!!!  this is a great product - not greasy and hydrates well.  Soaks right into the skin. Hope they never stop selling this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time fan of this product, and order it whenever I run out. Can&#x27;t be without it, since it does exactly what it promises:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--super moisturizes the eye and lip area&lt;br /&gt;--spreads smoothly and evenly&lt;br /&gt;--makes a noticeable difference in diminishing the look of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;--gives a silky base for concealer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have tried multiple eye creams to find one that actually makes a difference and this one is it. I used Olay regenerist for a long time - but was not convinced it was really helping.  What I like about this cream is when I put it on, it soaks in nicely - leaves my skin moist - I can put on concealer and there is no creasing or fake looking color.  I love it</li>
    <li> After trying many eye creams, this one proves to be the absolute best, hands down! It plumps up the eye area and moisturizes well.  Very concentrated, you only need much less than a pearl size dot.  Eyes look fresh and dewy for several hours. I don&#x27;t notice any effect on my lips. Product comes in small tube with no unnecessary packaging. It&#x27;s one of the few products I&#x27;d rather not live without!</li>
    <li> Now THIS, I like. Very creamy, too creamy for me to use during the day under makeup but perfect for nightime.  Other Philosophy HOPE products for skin I haven&#x27;t liked, for example, the HOPE in a jar, but this one is not stinky and comes out in a nice smooth small amount. One tube lasts me a loooooong time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and have seen no results. Not only that, when it is put on the target area, it appears shinier than any other part of the face. (This draws attention to the problems areas.) I&#x27;m glad I was able to buy this at a reasonable price to try it out.</li>
    <li> This product has mineral oil and petroleum in it in the top 10 ingredients, two very cheap fillers that do not metabolize into the skin.. The eye area is already very thin and delicate without pores so it&#x27;s hard enough getting an eye cream to show results in a relatively fast amount of time but this product causes my eye area to form milia (tiny white bumps under the surface of the skin that form from using cheap ingredients the skin can&#x27;t absorb effectively like this) when you use cheap filler ingredients like mineral oil, petroleum and parabens it doesn&#x27;t actually absorb effectively enough to show any signs of improvement..</li>
    <li> I thought I reviewed this 1 but here I go again. Didn&#x27;t work! The best is made by TOO FACED WRINKLE REMOVER. Instant results with a slight tint for brightening. Now it is here on Amazon. I bought mine at a Beauty Store in N.H. &amp; I still have it after 2 years. Love!!!! Try it before you buy any other it is amazing.</li>
    <li> Like product good value ! Did not like that there was not a seal on the tube . It also took a while to recieve it.</li>
    <li> This is a good philosophy product but I recently tried their eye repair with retinol and have been using it.  Great products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Philosophy Hope in a Tube Eye and Lip Cream for years. I love it and nothing else compares. Under eye dryness is moisturized very well with this cream. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands that don&#x27;t help, waste money, and are a disappointment. Philosophy is different and this is truly the best eye cream product on the market.</li>
    <li> Upon first application, I loved the smooth texture and how it made my skin feel soft and moisturized. I was very pleased with the product until the fourth day, when I woke up to red, swollen patches under my eyes. It looked like I had been hit with a baseball on both eyes. The redness went away after about 36 hours. But the skin under my eyes became tough and flaky, even though I was slathering on face cream several times per day. The area stopped flaking after several days, and the skin became it&#x27;s normal texture again. I am sure this product will work wonders for many people, but unfortunately my face does not like something that&#x27;s in it.</li>
    <li> Seems to keep my lips and skin soft. I wouldn&#x27;t say that my fine lines have diminished though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this faithfully for about 2 years now. It is very thick and dense (it&#x60;s supposed to be that way) but the absorption is quick and impressive. No issues with eye make up on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;m 43 and this is the one product that, applied in the morning, makes the area around the eyes feel hydrated the whole day long, with no make-up caking right under the eyes, at the end of a very long day.This has become my go-to eye contour product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this and strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very happy, half the price from stores and wonderful product. Thanks</li>
</ol>
