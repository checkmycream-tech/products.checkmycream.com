      <li>The kind of smell one gets when forgetting to use any deodorant at all.</li>

      <li>it smells good, it&#x27;s not overpowering, but most importantly it lasts all day.</li>

      <li>He is allergic to the ingredients of most mass market products.</li>
      <li>It is&lt;br /&gt;nice to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>It is more for my husband</li>
      <li>Thanks for having something that is so great for me.</li>
      <li>Product works really well and the scent is very light and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells pretty good too.</li>
      <li>and I think it could easily be used by men or women.</li>
      <li>It has a strong men&#x27;s cologne scent.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant is all natural free of many of the items that aren&#x27;t good for your skin.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant is hands down the best on the market.</li>
      <li>Herbal Clear Sport is the most effective deodorant I have used that does not contain aluminum.</li>
      <li>I bought this in my constant search of a good working deodorant without aluminium.</li>
      <li>Smells really good and last 24hrs+</li>
      <li>Its got a basic scent, kind of reminds me of the beach, but the important thing is it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Works excellently and this new scent is subtle but refreshing.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
      <li>As is the case with most natural deodorants, you will perspire.  </li>
      <li>only wish this product were more widely available.</li>
      <li>and I started looking for a more natural solution to see if it would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I already owned one (Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials natural deodorant) that worked pretty well, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find one that would work better.</li>
      <li>I am very allergic to any metals and preservatives and chemicals, so herbal clear has become my favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>To be more specific the ingredients are (in order): propylene glycol, water, sodium stearate, stereth-100, lichen extract, fragrance, tea tree oil, triethanolamine, oleth-2, tetrasodium</li>
      <li>When I first began to use this product, it would sting my armpits.</li>
      <li>I have to use more of the deodorant to make it last longer.</li>
      <li>This is the best men&#x27;s (natural) deodorant on the market...odorless and keeps you dry for a long time...</li>
      <li>so i was looking for something to block out that sweaty smell without giving me any bumps, rashes, or irritation in the armpit area, this product has done wonders, i first purchased at whole foods</li>
      <li>As far as deodorants go I&#x27;ve tried my fair share switching between all the major commercial brands.</li>
      <li>so i don&#x27;t even sweat that much.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.  </li>
      <li>cheaper, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It holds me very well.</li>
      <li>First time using natural, non aluminum, deodorant.</li>
      <li>I live in AZ where one really needs a product like this.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend you giving it a try.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for quality, aluminum-free protection.</li>
      <li>Keeps my pits dry and and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>bit about why I chose to begin searching for a new deodorant</li>
      <li>It truly lives up to its name as a 24 hour protecting deodorant while while other brands like a natural deodorant don&#x27;t work is good and ur just too expensive on top of it.</li>
      <li>I usually buy 6 or more at a time.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like other natural deodorants, it has no aluminum, zinc, or silver (which if you have metal allergies is a life saver), it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, and best of all, you don&#x27;t have to reapply it multiple times a day like some of the others if you&#x27;re a heavy sweater.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I sweat a lot and this keeps me dry and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Not as bad as brands like Tom&#x27;s, but not as good as Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray Mist or Adama Minerals ClayDry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Herbal clear sport for about a year.</li>
      <li>Do not purchase Herbal Clear or you will be dissapointed.</li>
      <li>Herbal Clear Sport works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And (hopefully) it&#x27;s much safer than the standard underarm products out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with wind salt for my natural deodorant approach from now on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>When I tried several of the Tom&#x27;s of Main deodorants I had to reapply up to 4 times a day</li>
      <li>I have a high stress, fast paced, job and interact with hundreds of people everyday.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a few missteps, with products that didn&#x27;t keep me fresh all day, I finally stumbled upon Herbal Clear Sport and I&#x27;ve never been happier.</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY deodorant that has worked for me (natural or not)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few natural deodorants over the last couple of years, the price is right and it works.</li>
      <li>figure the product would work because of all the positive reviews, but i did not share the same experience as the other reviews.  </li>
      <li>From within the first few minutes I used it I began to smell like armpits.</li>
      <li>I noticed it melts a little bit easier, so unless stored in a climate controlled place it might be very gooey, or if you try to put it on you might have to blot with a paper towel afterwards.</li>

    <li> As far as deodorants go I&#x27;ve tried my fair share switching between all the major commercial brands. This one works the best for me. I am an extremely active person usually walking, running, and moving around at least 6+ miles a day. I apply this in the morning and by the time I get done working out at night I&#x27;m still smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit about why I chose to begin searching for a new deodorant and why I chose this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the winter months, my skin would dry out considerably and I would usually get an annoying rash under the area where I applied the deodorant, it would extend under my arms, pretty much everywhere I sweat. I tried every brand I could, antiperspirants were worse and nothing I tried seemed to help. I even went to the Dr. and he prescribed some sort of Topo lotion. I didn&#x27;t see much of an improvement, and by the next winter it was back as usual. Nothing worked. Finally I went online looking for answers and found out about all the added chemicals in standard deodorants and I started looking for a more natural solution to see if it would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few missteps, with products that didn&#x27;t keep me fresh all day, I finally stumbled upon Herbal Clear Sport and I&#x27;ve never been happier. It&#x27;s not the most over powering scent. I&#x27;m a guy and I think it could easily be used by men or women. Its got a basic scent, kind of reminds me of the beach, but the important thing is it gets the job done. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and half now and haven&#x27;t had any noticeable rash reappear. This is now my go to choice for deodorant and I don&#x27;t see myself ever switching.</li>
    <li> Herbal Clear Sport is the most effective deodorant I have used that does not contain aluminum. It deodorizes with tea tree oil and lichen. Highly recommended for quality, aluminum-free protection.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is hands down the best on the market. It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like other natural deodorants, it has no aluminum, zinc, or silver (which if you have metal allergies is a life saver), it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, and best of all, you don&#x27;t have to reapply it multiple times a day like some of the others if you&#x27;re a heavy sweater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sweat a lot. I have a high stress, fast paced, job and interact with hundreds of people everyday. This is the ONLY deodorant that has worked for me (natural or not) AND it doesn&#x27;t stain. it smells good, it&#x27;s not overpowering, but most importantly it lasts all day. It was so frustrating to have to reapply deodorant at least once half way through the day with Right Guard Sport. When I tried several of the Tom&#x27;s of Main deodorants I had to reapply up to 4 times a day and I was constantly worried about whether or not my customers could smell me. Herbal Clear Sport works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found this product!</li>
    <li> this is the only brand of deodorant i have been using for the last 7 years, i play a lot of sports and my job requires me to be physically active so i was looking for something to block out that sweaty smell without giving me any bumps, rashes, or irritation in the armpit area, this product has done wonders, i first purchased at whole foods but recently i have been buying in bulk on amazon because it comes out cheaper, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Herbal clear sport for about a year. It holds me very well. I live in AZ where one really needs a product like this.</li>
    <li> First time using natural, non aluminum, deodorant. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. Smells really good and last 24hrs+</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  Keeps my pits dry and and clean smelling.  And (hopefully) it&#x27;s much safer than the standard underarm products out there.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for years. He is allergic to the ingredients of most mass market products. It is&lt;br /&gt;nice to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years. It truly lives up to its name as a 24 hour protecting deodorant while while other brands like a natural deodorant don&#x27;t work is good and ur just too expensive on top of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in my constant search of a good working deodorant without aluminium. I already owned one (Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials natural deodorant) that worked pretty well, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find one that would work better. Herbal Clear Sport was a bad attempt. From within the first few minutes I used it I began to smell like armpits. The kind of smell one gets when forgetting to use any deodorant at all. I thought maybe it was just me so I decided to try it the next day after showering. Again, the same thing happened. I was so dissapointed. I think my purchase came with three of them, all of which ended up in the garbage. I guess I&#x27;ll be sticking with Arm &amp; Hammer for a while.  Do not purchase Herbal Clear or you will be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best men&#x27;s (natural) deodorant on the market...odorless and keeps you dry for a long time...</li>
    <li> The product simply does not work.  it&#x27;s been a while since i smelled my pits and got a whiff of something truly foul.  After using this product, i can sadly say that time has come again.  I&#x27;m a mid twenties guy and i work an office job so i don&#x27;t even sweat that much. figure the product would work because of all the positive reviews, but i did not share the same experience as the other reviews.  i would not recommend this product. I&#x27;ll stick with wind salt for my natural deodorant approach from now on.</li>
    <li> This product received mixed reviews but I decided to give it a try.  For the longest time I have used the crystal deodorant.  I noticed with continued use, that you develop a weird body smell so I decided it was time to switch.  This deodorant is all natural free of many of the items that aren&#x27;t good for your skin.  I love this deodorant.  It has a pleasant smell, when applied but doesn&#x27;t linger,  and does keep you odor free all day.  I sweat a lot and this keeps me dry and fresh.  Would highly recommend you giving it a try.  Price is good also.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant my husband and I can use!! It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  I usually buy 6 or more at a time.  Never to run out. It is more for my husband but I use it too..</li>
    <li> Product works really well and the scent is very light and pleasant.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased only wish this product were more widely available.</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant because as the name suggests, I thought it would get me through a workout.  It does not!  As is the case with most natural deodorants, you will perspire.  Unfortunately, it does nothing to cover up odor.  It has a strong men&#x27;s cologne scent.  Not as bad as brands like Tom&#x27;s, but not as good as Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray Mist or Adama Minerals ClayDry.</li>
    <li> When I first began to use this product, it would sting my armpits. It also did not provide enough protection to last throughout the workday. I have to use more of the deodorant to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this when I work 8 hour shifts and have to be moving around a lot. I noticed it melts a little bit easier, so unless stored in a climate controlled place it might be very gooey, or if you try to put it on you might have to blot with a paper towel afterwards. I noticed after a long shift I could smell my underarms, or after going to the gym. I&#x27;m a bit reluctant to go too hard on this product as it uses tea tree oil and lichen and doesn&#x27;t have the same advantages one with lots of chemicals do. To be more specific the ingredients are (in order): propylene glycol, water, sodium stearate, stereth-100, lichen extract, fragrance, tea tree oil, triethanolamine, oleth-2, tetrasodium EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells pretty good too. If you&#x27;re just sitting down, I think it would meet your needs. But if you sweat a lot and don&#x27;t want to be smelt at all, I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am very allergic to any metals and preservatives and chemicals, so herbal clear has become my favorite deodorant. Works excellently and this new scent is subtle but refreshing. Thanks for having something that is so great for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few natural deodorants over the last couple of years, the price is right and it works. No aluminium which is the key,</li>
