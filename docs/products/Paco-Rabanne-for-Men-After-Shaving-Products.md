    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used Paco in years.  Always loved it.  I have a tad left over from years ago.  But this is not the exact same fragrance.  It does smell nice for sure and that part is great.  But it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Maybe 2 hours later you really can&#x27;t smell it. I am used to other fragrance that last 4 or 5 hours ... maybe even longer (PS is one that does that, as an example).  Like it said, it does smell nice... but take the bottle with you if you are going out for the evening.  You&#x27;ll want to re-apply it if you want her to smell it later.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who has used it for a long time.  He wont switch to anything else.  I found that the cost was less expensive than buying at my local beauty supply store.  He originally received it as a gift from my sister who was on a European trip.  From that time on thats all he wanted.  The scent is not overpowering but very fresh and I love it also.</li>

    <li> I used Paco Rebanne Sport for many years until it became unavailable. This aftershave is very close to it,so I am stocking up.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this for over 20 years. He does not like cologne, only aftershave. I really like the smell as well, so I am always trying to find it. I buy two bottles at a time. This is very good. It took a very long time to get here though about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this; using for years.  Hope it never is discontiuned!</li>
    <li> This is an old reliable that provide a fresh, clean finish to the shaving process.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, amazing service.... timely delivery...&lt;br /&gt;Fully satisfied. Will order again</li>
    <li> A splash bottle not the spray which I prefer- has a paper  stick on label which makes me suspicious of the actual product</li>
    <li> Had used it for years, then had a tough time finding it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and the price was wonderful</li>
    <li> No other fragrance for me, it been my favorite since it was introduced and defines me.  Not an overpowering scent, just enough to make my wife notice.</li>

    <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s so hard to find ... it&#x27;s been my aftershave for many decades.  Maybe it&#x27;s just too &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; for the market?</li>
