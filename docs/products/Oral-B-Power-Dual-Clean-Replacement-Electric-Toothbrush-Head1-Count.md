      <li>Exactly as described, and it does a great job.</li>
      <li>I think it cleans OK, but probably will replace it soon.</li>

      <li>The top one rotates and the bottom one moves as well.</li>
      <li>Comparing it to the precision head that came with my toothbrush (the top circular part of this brush head alone), I would prefer the precision one over this brush as this feels bulky in my mouth.</li>
      <li>so I dont know if that one is any better).</li>
      <li>Much better than the one you receive with the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Better than the original ones that came with the toothbrush!</li>
      <li>The circular part is good for precision and the bottom part is good for extra brushing going around your teeth.</li>
      <li>My original brush head that came with purchase was much better.</li>
      <li>It attaches to shower head, so it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Get the most clean feel after use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another fine product from Oral-B.</li>
      <li>the item was as described and is a genuine product from braun.</li>
      <li>It is the only one I have tried with my new Oral-B toothbrush, but it is awesome.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done though and my teeth still feel clean after brushing.</li>
      <li>I never felt like my teeth were getting really clean.  </li>
      <li>Just what I wanted and it was the right one!</li>
      <li>It feels like this does twice the work in the same time, which makes it more appealing, and I found it comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>But it works just great and isn&#x27;t too big and feels like it does a more thorough job of cleaning (and it covers a larger area).</li>
      <li>It does a great job cleaning as did the previous head.</li>
      <li>This was the first head I purchased to replace the original on my electronic brush.</li>
      <li>The double head works great for cleaning -- so much better than the single head.</li>
      <li>These feel noticeably more hard/firm that my soft manual toothbrush, and I regret not being smarter about switching over to electric.</li>
      <li>I prefer the floss action head better.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel good, plaque was much less at cleaning appt.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Seller shipped very fast.</li>
      <li>Unusual dual brush head, really get teeth and gums clean, also polishes teeth,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I thought that the dual head would give me a better cleaning, but somehow it was the opposite.</li>
      <li>When I found this larger head, I immediately felt like it was doing a better job.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what it says it is.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on my basic toothbrush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Just be aware-</li>
      <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more a a personal preference that a design issue.</li>
      <li>The head works fine, the only problem is that the head is very large.</li>
      <li>(The only decent replacement head is the Precision Clean &amp; the Dual Clean).</li>
      <li>I like the size, its more the size of a conventional brush, covers more teeth at the same time</li>
      <li>How much can one say about a purely functional necessity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works very well</li>
      <li>I had better expectations,the fitting is poor and I didn&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
      <li>very effectively.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You might want to try the Oral B Cross Action for a more thorough cleaning</li>
      <li>This one is bigger but doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well.</li>
      <li>I have a big mouth and it still takes up a good portion of my mouth, I&#x27;ll just stick with the smaller heads next time.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I have a particularly &amp;#34;big mouth.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>As the naysayer said &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t fit in your mouth as well as the Single piece brushes&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to everybody.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>and I think it is worth the extra money to buy it again.  </li>
      <li>There may be other models it doesn&#x27;t fit as well</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the &amp;#34;Oral-B Professional Floss Action&amp;#34; brush instead.  </li>
      <li>I may return to my original head due to the size of this one.</li>
      <li>They seem to last a decent amount of time, while cleaning really well.</li>
      <li>I could not angle the brush to hit my gums properly, because the head was so large.</li>
      <li>Better than those little tiny heads.  </li>
      <li>(I haven&#x27;t used the floss action brush head yet</li>
      <li>While it says \\&quot;Fits all Oral B Power Toothbrushes except CrossAction Power.\\&quot;, it also does not work with Sonic Complete.  </li>
      <li>I usually use the regular heads but saw this and thought it sounded interesting.</li>
      <li>Was a little disappointed with the quality of the head but works great and even better than the standard head!</li>
      <li>I will try new heads in the future but this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We have basic Oral-B professional toothbrushes and my husband likes the head for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>My husband felt like it was big at first, but I, with my smaller mouth than his, never felt like it was too big.  </li>
      <li>and it definitely beats the precission brush head by far</li>
      <li>I had much less bleeding at cleaning too, only at back, and I think the irrigator is responsible for that.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Better than the original ones that came with the toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This is for my husband&#x27;s toothbrush, these are cheap and they are great. No complaints from him. They seem to last a decent amount of time, while cleaning really well.</li>
    <li> The head works fine, the only problem is that the head is very large. I have a big mouth and it still takes up a good portion of my mouth, I&#x27;ll just stick with the smaller heads next time.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done though and my teeth still feel clean after brushing. Comparing it to the precision head that came with my toothbrush (the top circular part of this brush head alone), I would prefer the precision one over this brush as this feels bulky in my mouth. A smaller version of this would be great!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush head. It cleans my teeth quite well. How much can one say about a purely functional necessity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another fine product from Oral-B.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this one! It feels really good on my teeth. I use my OralB religiously, twice a day. My teeth feel good, plaque was much less at cleaning appt. I am not going to use nitrous oxide at next appt. The head I was using has an octagon shape. It wore out, I went to buy more but saw this one. I also use an irrigator called Shower Breeze. You might want to check it out. It attaches to shower head, so it is easy to use. I had much less bleeding at cleaning too, only at back, and I think the irrigator is responsible for that.</li>
    <li> Great deal ,  I liked it very much!</li>
    <li> I had a Oral-B sonic vitality before and I think it is worth the extra money to buy it again.  The duel clean gets dirty in between the two brush heads.  I&#x27;m already on my second head and it is getting dirty too.  I think it cleans OK, but probably will replace it soon.</li>
    <li> Best replacement head so far.  (The only decent replacement head is the Precision Clean &amp; the Dual Clean).</li>
    <li> the item was as described and is a genuine product from braun. Was a little disappointed with the quality of the head but works great and even better than the standard head! would buy again</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for my Braun Oral B battery toothbrush (which btw- is probably the best value ever in electric toothbrushes). In use and working perfectly. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush head for a month or two now. At first I was afraid to open the packaging because of all those reports about brush heads having no repacement ring, having an oral-B insignia with a grey background, and made in Germany are counterfiet. But, eventually I opened the package, and nothing is wrong with the brush head. It is Not a Tongue Mutilator, nor does it have out of shape bristels, not is it a counterfeit. All those pieces of information are either false, or just one time bad experiences. My brush head still has its shape maintained, isn&#x27;t too hard and hasn&#x27;t done anything funky. I like the size, its more the size of a conventional brush, covers more teeth at the same time and I just like it. If someone has a smaller than average mouth then, or if you&#x27;re one of those people who was used to small brush heads back in the day (when you used conventional brushes), then this brush head is not for you. Otherwise its a wonderful brush head and it definitely beats the precission brush head by far (I haven&#x27;t used the floss action brush head yet so I dont know if that one is any better).</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product</li>
    <li> It does a great job cleaning as did the previous head. I may return to my original head due to the size of this one. As the naysayer said &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t fit in your mouth as well as the Single piece brushes&amp;#34;. I haven&#x27;t had serious issues. It&#x27;s more a a personal preference that a design issue. It works well and I recommend it to people with mouths with average or &amp;#62; average size. Buy 1 try it, if you love it buy more. The bulk pack is way Cheaper.</li>
    <li> I prefer the floss action head better. This one is bigger but doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too big...it&#x27;s the size of a medium or full-sized toothbrush head, which I prefer.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Product Features\\&quot; info on this item is INCORRECT! While it says \\&quot;Fits all Oral B Power Toothbrushes except CrossAction Power.\\&quot;, it also does not work with Sonic Complete.  There may be other models it doesn&#x27;t fit as well so I suggest researching this further BEFORE buying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do note however that the return process was VERY EASY, VERY QUICK &amp; PAINLESS!  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Better than those little tiny heads.  Who likes little tiny heads?  I don&#x27;t like little tiny heads.</li>
    <li> It works very well and I have not had any cavities since I started using oral b products. Seller shipped very fast. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush recently and ordered the replacement brush head from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It has 2 parts. The top one rotates and the bottom one moves as well. Cleans teeth very effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: battery operated brush.</li>
    <li> I had better expectations,the fitting is poor and I didn&#x27;t like it that much. My original brush head that came with purchase was much better.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. You might want to try the Oral B Cross Action for a more thorough cleaning</li>
    <li> This is by far, the worst Oral-B replacement brush I have ever used.  Maybe if you have a big huge mouth it works well, but for the average person it&#x27;s very hard to navigate the insides of your teeth.  Highly recommend the &amp;#34;Oral-B Professional Floss Action&amp;#34; brush instead.  It works great for tartar control and massages your gums as you brush.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this because others found the brush part too big compared to the head that came with the handle.  I don&#x27;t find that to be the case at all I don&#x27;t think I have a particularly &amp;#34;big mouth.&amp;#34;  It feels like this does twice the work in the same time, which makes it more appealing, and I found it comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Unusual dual brush head, really get teeth and gums clean, also polishes teeth,&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and it was the right one!</li>
    <li> This was the first head I purchased to replace the original on my electronic brush. I found this head to be way to bulky. I thought that the dual head would give me a better cleaning, but somehow it was the opposite. I could not angle the brush to hit my gums properly, because the head was so large. At my cleaning after I purchased this, my dentist said I had a lot of plaque build up on my back teeth. I switched to the floss head, and am very happy.</li>
    <li> nice brush works well</li>
    <li> Excellent.....and good price, too!</li>
    <li> Much better than the one you receive with the toothbrush. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this brush head because of all the reviews that said it was big i.e hard to handle.  But I took the chance bought it.  While it is big, once you&#x27;ve had it for few days, you don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s size.  You do notice, however, how cleaner your mouth feels then with a single brush head.  You get all this at an affordable price.  Remarkable.</li>
    <li> Pros: OEM. Brush head indicates when it needs to be replaced. Excellent price point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this supplier again. Excellent service</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I like it very much. It cleans teeth somehow quicker and better maybe. I highly recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this toothbrush, does the job! Medium.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using these, my dentist&#x27;s office has been delighted.</li>
    <li> I like this head a lot! It is the only one I have tried with my new Oral-B toothbrush, but it is awesome. The circular part is good for precision and the bottom part is good for extra brushing going around your teeth. I will try new heads in the future but this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware- if you don&#x27;t have a big mouth this may not fit. I have a big mouth and it is tough to navigate occasionaly so take that into consideration.</li>
    <li> We have basic Oral-B professional toothbrushes and my husband likes the head for sensitive teeth. I usually use the regular heads but saw this and thought it sounded interesting. I was a little worried that it might be too big for my mouth and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on my basic toothbrush. But it works just great and isn&#x27;t too big and feels like it does a more thorough job of cleaning (and it covers a larger area). It may run the battery down a little faster, but that doesn&#x27;t matter when you charge regularly. We share 1 charger and I don&#x27;t charge my toothbrush except every couple of weeks.  If you are in doubt, I&#x27;d try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to cancel my return request for Order #111-4959302-478203, wuith no success.  I had received this order and there,s no need to return it.</li>
    <li> A few times a week I go to town with this brush head. After 2 minutes I feel like I just got my teeth cleaned</li>
    <li> The brush I use this with has been a great purchase and so far I like this head the best. Get the most clean feel after use.</li>
    <li> I used these for my oral electric toothbrush for over 2 years.  However, I recently stopped because my dentist noticed gum recession (not good) and mentioned that a lot of electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t have soft bristles.  These feel noticeably more hard/firm that my soft manual toothbrush, and I regret not being smarter about switching over to electric.</li>
    <li> Previously we had the smaller round brush head on our toothbrushes.  I never felt like my teeth were getting really clean.  When I found this larger head, I immediately felt like it was doing a better job.  I love how it makes my gums around my teeth feel \\&quot;massaged\\&quot;.  My husband felt like it was big at first, but I, with my smaller mouth than his, never felt like it was too big.  It was a good find</li>
    <li> I really like these brush heads for three reasons: they are good for teeth, good for gums, and are long-lived.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.  It has been very difficult to find them in stores.  The double head works great for cleaning -- so much better than the single head.</li>
    <li> Fits my Triumph Professional Series perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Exactly what it says it is.</li>
