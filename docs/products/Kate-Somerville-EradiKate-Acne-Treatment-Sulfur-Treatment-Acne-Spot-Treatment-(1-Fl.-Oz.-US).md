      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t unbearable, especially with great results!</li>
      <li>this is my favorite go-to for spot treating acne.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but I need to do more research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>insert a q-tip touching the bottom of the bottle and apply to face.</li>
      <li>I get whiteheads, blackheads, and cyst type blemish and have elected to eat healthy and drink plenty of water to control my blemish vs. taking loads of medication from the doctors.</li>
      <li>all good at attempting to calm reddening flare</li>
      <li>I love this product and Sephora who has been servicing my needs for quite some time.</li>
      <li>Was very excited to find an over-the-counter acne treatment that wasn&#x27;t salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.</li>
      <li>The important thing is to follow instructions that are on the top of the bottle&#x27;s cap:</li>
      <li>but I guess this was too strong for my skin... too strong.</li>
      <li>EradiKate works, although be forewarned of the chemical smell, which is strong.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best cure ever!!!!</li>
      <li>After putting this on my acne at night, I am finding that it dries up and heals the pimples quite quickly!  </li>
      <li>I get one huge zit once a month</li>
      <li>This product has made a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>I can use it daily with a light moisturizer and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>) acne free.</li>
      <li>It works fantastic on the small/whitehead pimples.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, the tone is also evening out, and there is not a pimple to be found.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly this has worked wonders for me both as a spot treatment and a preventative as the areas I&#x27;ve applied &amp; treated have remained clear.</li>
      <li>In addition, the KS skin care line for combination/acne is quite good; I actually used to use prescription products, but found that this line suits my needs even better.</li>
      <li>It smells more of alcohol at first, but when you wake up you&#x27;ll smell the sulfur.</li>
      <li>I generally have good skin</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Since that time I&#x27;ve tried many many \\&quot;spa\\&quot; and so-called high end treatments that do little more than smell pleasant.</li>
      <li>I apply this with a clean q-tip.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, MANY products for my ailing adult acne, and none have quite compared to this as a spot treatment.  </li>
      <li>I think with a day or two more of treatment it will be completely gone :)</li>
      <li>Love this product, has helped alot although its very drying</li>
      <li>not happening i love food too much)</li>
      <li>Received item quickly and it was as described.</li>
      <li>Thank you to this company for making such a great product that truly works, I don&#x27;t even have to wear as much</li>
      <li>There are many stores (especially online) that sell top of the line beauty products, but I have never been dissatified with kate somersville products or sephora.     </li>
      <li>this product very much indeed!</li>
      <li>Works perfect when you feel a blemish start but within a few treatments will eradicate older ones.</li>
      <li>, my skin has improved that much in 2 weeks!!</li>
      <li>my skin is almost completely clear and healthy.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s all mixed together, it&#x27;s not as effective for whatever reason....</li>
      <li>The smell is worth it, though, because when you put this on a blemish at night, it&#x27;s gone by the morning.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>So worth the money and hype.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Pain&amp;#34; is beauty right?</li>
      <li>Using it right now, as a matter of fact.</li>
      <li>This product is by far much cheaper than my $100.00 prescription medication for acne and works much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been through multiple prescription drugs to help clear up my face, but most didn&#x27;t work or irritated my skin so much that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell even if they had worked.</li>
      <li>Gave it to my sister after having such success, who was having a lot of breakouts on her chin for many years and within 2 days her skin was starting to heal and looked a lot better.</li>
      <li>It dries out your skin a little so using a moisturizer is a good idea.</li>
      <li>it does has a sulfur smell, i like it but to others smell like hospital but overall love</li>
      <li>The cystic breakout on my chin is significantly better, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it is the size of a regular pimple now!</li>
      <li>For clearer skin, I&#x27;d gladly put up with the initial smell.</li>
      <li>It also stings a bit when you first put it on with a cotton swab.</li>
      <li>It performs exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re hesitant because of the price, consider it a good investment, your skin will thank you a few weeks after using it.</li>
      <li>The trade-off (and I have extremely fair, sensitive skin) is that KS leaves my skin very very very dry and itchy and MB does not.</li>
      <li>If you have minimal to moderate acne, it&#x27;s a great addition to your face care line-up.</li>
      <li>(even if I just use a dab), and it makes my skin bright red the next morning.</li>
      <li>Based on the positive reviews I decided to order Kate Somerville EradiKate Acne Treatment and to my surprise this product have worked wonders on my face.</li>
      <li>but I seem to have super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The main ingredient in KS is sulfur, whereas that is the 5th ingredient in MB drying lotion, and a form of alcohol is the first.</li>
      <li>My hopes had risen very high beacuse of what others wrote about this product</li>
      <li>Use this product at night on problem areas and only wash your face with a light cleanser at night and with just water in the morning.</li>
      <li>fast...</li>
      <li>Thanks Catharine</li>
      <li>For real.</li>
      <li>Oh my gosh this is an absolute godsend.</li>
      <li>MB is much gentler on the skin, although the time to heal a pimple is a bit slower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 26 now and have tried Differin, Proactive, Epiduo, Tazorac; none of them really made a difference.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t fool proof because once you use a lot, you really gotta get the q-tip in there.</li>
      <li>On the cystic zits, it&#x27;s not quite as effective, but it does get rid of them after a few days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bye Bye Blemish is the exact same thing for 1/4 price.</li>
    <li> Strong alcoholic smell and it works really good!</li>
    <li> My adult acne has been really stubborn, and gets worse in the summer.  This product has made a huge difference.  Is a little smelly and a little flaky, but since I wear it at night I don&#x27;t care!  It means I don&#x27;t have zits in the morning!</li>
    <li> When I was on vacation visiting my sister and family, she introduced me to Eradikate and said that Kate Sommerville changed her skin. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s totally amazing. Worth every penny. Get it. For real. I have sensitive skin and if I feel it drying up too fast, I&#x27;ll wash it off and it still works. Just start with a tiny bit and see how it works. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to not shake it!! There is a pink sediment at the bottom and a clear layer of liquid on top. Dip a q-tip in it to the bottom and then pull out slowly and put on face. This is how you are supposed to do it. Don&#x27;t mix it up.</li>
    <li> Great price for a substantial amount of very effective treatment.  Yes it smells like matches/stinky farts/an erupted volcano, but it works and is especially soothing on cystic acne.  I use it as an overnight treatment and after applying I put a towel over my pillow so it doesn&#x27;t stink up the sheets. I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it overnight if anyone had to share a bed with my, though.  I wish I knew about this stuff 15 years ago during puberty.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My daughter has tried many products and loves this better than all others!</li>
    <li> Was very excited to find an over-the-counter acne treatment that wasn&#x27;t salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. However, the smell is overwhelming, it dries out my skin like CRAZY (even if I just use a dab), and it makes my skin bright red the next morning. I have this issue with benzoyl peroxide products (the redness) and was hoping to find something that would help with that. Was disappointed overall. It DOES clear up acne but I seem to have super sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll just have to keep looking!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other products one being Proactive which destroyed my skin making it extremely dry and flaky. This stuff is the complete opposite. I like applying it all over my face that were prone to breakouts, at night before bed, sleeping with it on and then washing my face in the morning.It does say not to shake it but a lot of the thick pink stuff sinks to the bottom leaving the liquid solution chillin at the top. I just go ahead and gently turn the bottle upside down until it all mixes together and then will use my fingers to apply it. Do not be hesitant to buy this product! It worked miracles for me and might for you too!</li>
    <li> After putting this on my acne at night, I am finding that it dries up and heals the pimples quite quickly!  I have tried many, MANY products for my ailing adult acne, and none have quite compared to this as a spot treatment.  1 night showed improvement, but at about 3 nights, the pimples that were treated are just about GONE!  I would highly recommend this product to those suffering from any form of acne. I have not experienced any drying yet, and yes, it dries pink like Calomine lotion, but who cares if you&#x27;re wearing it to bed. Better than a paper sack!  lol</li>
    <li> Received item quickly and it was as described.</li>
    <li> I have used a prescription sulphur product in the past, and I was very pleased to get the same results with EradiKate without having to get a prescription. It&#x27;s especially good at getting rid of the painful, under-the-skin cysts. Amazon had the best price I found on it, too.</li>
    <li> Love this product, has helped alot although its very drying and once it dries it flakes. Its used purposely for zits but i applied it all over and it helped so much but remember to moisture especially with SPF cause its very heavy and this dried the face. DO NOT SHAKE THE BOTTLE! insert a q-tip touching the bottom of the bottle and apply to face. it does has a sulfur smell, i like it but to others smell like hospital but overall love this product very much indeed!</li>
    <li> EradiKate works, although be forewarned of the chemical smell, which is strong. This product takes me back twenty years when acne treatment creams smelled medicinal, but actually worked. Since that time I&#x27;ve tried many many \\&quot;spa\\&quot; and so-called high end treatments that do little more than smell pleasant. This stinks, but works....and has the added bonus of a trip down memory lane.</li>
    <li> Though it is a little drying, this cleared up my very persistent acne, doesn&#x27;t work on blackheads but did wonders on those tiny bumps on cheek and jaw area, my skin is now completely clear, albiet the occasional pimple which stands no chance to this acne treatment, especially when applied at the first signs of a break out.</li>
    <li> I love this product and Sephora who has been servicing my needs for quite some time. There are many stores (especially online) that sell top of the line beauty products, but I have never been dissatified with kate somersville products or sephora.     This particular product clears the skin quite well, but is really meant for blemishes. I have combination skin, not acne, but at times the hormonal changes kick in and this remedy clears them up soo...fast... In addition, the KS skin care line for combination/acne is quite good; I actually used to use prescription products, but found that this line suits my needs even better. I also use epoince products and they are excellent too.....particuarly if you are concerned about breakouts and have troubled skin.     Thanks Catharine</li>
    <li> It works fantastic on the small/whitehead pimples. They&#x27;re gone the next day. On the cystic zits, it&#x27;s not quite as effective, but it does get rid of them after a few days. The big plus is there&#x27;s no scarring if you use it on those larger zits. If you have minimal to moderate acne, it&#x27;s a great addition to your face care line-up. If you&#x27;ve got severe acne, keep going to the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I prefer Eradikate over proactive. This product works for me. Its simple, 1 part application, let it sit for 15 minutes and then rinse off. I can use it once or twice a day. Using it right now, as a matter of fact. I would describe it as fingernail polish or paint that has lacquer thinner in it. Those aren&#x27;t the ingredients but you get the idea.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;m 27y.o. and have tried everything for my acne and works wonderfully and do quick I might add! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have been using MB drying lotion for YEARS, and decided to switch to this since they appeared similar. They are, in fact, very different and seem to work differently too. The main ingredient in KS is sulfur, whereas that is the 5th ingredient in MB drying lotion, and a form of alcohol is the first. It must be the sulfur that actually dries out the pimples because the KS stuff really gets rid of pimples much faster. I would say 3 days compared to MB at about 5 days. The trade-off (and I have extremely fair, sensitive skin) is that KS leaves my skin very very very dry and itchy and MB does not. MB is much gentler on the skin, although the time to heal a pimple is a bit slower. I would say that this product definitely works, but that it is at the cost of being harsh to the skin. A bit of MB around the edges of the pimple won&#x27;t affect the area without the pimple itself, but if the KS stuff gets onto other parts of the skin the whole area gets red/itchy, even if there is no pimple there, so you end up with a bigger infected area. They are both very effective, but MB is gentler. I&#x27;d repurchase either and might just switch between the two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne all my life and I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have adult acne. I get whiteheads, blackheads, and cyst type blemish and have elected to eat healthy and drink plenty of water to control my blemish vs. taking loads of medication from the doctors. I was browsing for something over the counter that could control my breakouts and not give me all the side effects that prescription medication can give you. Based on the positive reviews I decided to order Kate Somerville EradiKate Acne Treatment and to my surprise this product have worked wonders on my face. I still get my breakouts but not as bad and after putting this nightly treatment on my blemish by morning it is clear and by a few days it is dried up and practically gone. On the cyst ones that are under my skin they usually come to a head within a day and dried up easily. In the past, it took about one week for those harder cyst ones to clear up at times two weeks, their life span is much shorter with this product. I spot treat my blemish nightly and use under my makeup daily or as needed. It has also worked wonders for my oily skin as well. This product is by far much cheaper than my $100.00 prescription medication for acne and works much better.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best over-the-counter acne spot treatment there is. The sulfur is what makes this stuff work, but beware: it really stinks! It also stings a bit when you first put it on with a cotton swab. The smell is worth it, though, because when you put this on a blemish at night, it&#x27;s gone by the morning. Even if you put it on a blemish that&#x27;s already started getting worse, it helps.   Be careful when traveling with it, because it&#x27;s not supposed to be shaken at all. If you do happen to shake it up or drop it, wait for the pink sediment and the clear part to separate again. If it&#x27;s all mixed together, it&#x27;s not as effective for whatever reason....I learned that the hard way.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I read a review of it in some magazine recently and decided to give it a shot, since sulphur-based products have really helped my acne in the past. This stuff, however, goes far beyond anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. It dries out even a substantial pimple overnight. I expected it to smell strongly of sulphur (that rotten-eggsy smell) since most other sulphur-based items definitely do, but it&#x27;s not bad at all. When you first open the bottle, it smells like medicine or &#x27;chemical,&#x27; not at all sulphur-y. Once the product has dried on your face, though, it barely has any odor at all. I only really notice the sulphur smell when I wash the product off in the morning, and even then it&#x27;s very faint.  Great great product. I just wish I&#x27;d known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> I generally have good skin but I would break out on my chin. My facialist said it was hormonal.. maybe, who knows. Short of eating 100% clean (ahahhaha. not happening i love food too much), I thought I tried everything.  I was using benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid as spot treatment, frequently just applying to my chin sans zits just for a preventative measure. Well both of those products, especially the bp totally dried out my skin so I&#x27;d be left with a zit and flaky skin around the zit. Not attractive and even more difficult to cover up with makeup. Enter Kate Somerville Eradikate. This stuff is gold.  A lot of my zits were cystic. There would be a tiny little bump visible to only me for a month before it became a full on zit and there was nothing I could do to stop it. This stuff stops it.  Incredible really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply, I use a q-tip. It isn&#x27;t fool proof because once you use a lot, you really gotta get the q-tip in there. Also, the liquid accompanying sulfur dried out before I used up the sulfur. I need to figure out a way to make that a non-issue. I&#x27;m assuming some alcohol and water but I need to do more research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are cheaper products. I like them, but the sulfur is more liquidy and less of a paste than the Kate Somerville version. Ultimately cost is a factor though.. I wish this was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and finally, yes it does stink when you first apply it. Who cares!  When it dries, it no longer smells. &amp;#34;Pain&amp;#34; is beauty right? For clearer skin, I&#x27;d gladly put up with the initial smell.</li>
    <li> this product is awesome if you get those painful swollen pimples. I did not have acne as a teenager but it has come out of no where. Of course it&#x27;s that nasty &amp;#34;hormone&amp;#34; acne so no face wash or skin care line has helped. I came across this product and it literally worked over night! It&#x27;s not over drying like some spot treatments. I can use it daily with a light moisturizer and my skin looks great. So happy I can across this because not only were my pimples nasty to look at but they were painful!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used on my face. I&#x27;m in college now, and I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since 5th grade. It wasn&#x27;t the occasional pimple, or I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d have been such a big deal. I would break out so bad it would look like I had the chicken pox. I&#x27;ve been through multiple prescription drugs to help clear up my face, but most didn&#x27;t work or irritated my skin so much that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell even if they had worked. I ordered this randomly one day because of all of the positive reviews and I am beyond happy that I did. It took maybe 3 days for my face to start showing improvement. I&#x27;m at a little over 3 weeks now and my face is completely (and I mean COMPLETELY) acne free. It&#x27;s smooth, the tone is also evening out, and there is not a pimple to be found. I can&#x27;t believe it. I thought there was nothing I could do about my face, but this product changed my mind. I would recommend this to anyone whose tried plenty of products with little luck.</li>
    <li> Acne in middle age? Yes. And, once my previous source for a sulphur base remedy went out of business, I despaired, certain I&#x27;d never find another solution [so to speak!]. That is until my on-line searches found Kate Somerville EradiKate Acne Treatment for me. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I had to after discovering this product on amazon. This is the absolute best cure for cystic acne out there. I was struggling with breakouts along my cheek bone for 2 years and after using EradiKate for 3 months (one bottle lasted that long) my skin is almost completely clear and healthy. Gave it to my sister after having such success, who was having a lot of breakouts on her chin for many years and within 2 days her skin was starting to heal and looked a lot better. Use this product at night on problem areas and only wash your face with a light cleanser at night and with just water in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best blemish treatment I&#x27;ve ever used. It will literally reduce a pimple by 50% overnight, and makes all the difference in healing, and reducing. Will not use anything else. I apply this with a clean q-tip.</li>
    <li> It dried the heck out of my face!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my entire face was swollen for 2~3 consecutive days. I couldn&#x27;t even go outside during the day because my skin was literally PEELING  as if I had chemical peel done. I usually buy etude house ac clinic pink spot but for some reason I wanted to try this product out since there is so many positive reviews all over the internet (amazon,sephora,etc.) but I guess this was too strong for my skin... too strong. I really regret purchasing this, I feel like I wasted my money + ruined my skin.</li>
    <li> Great drying for quick results on breakouts</li>
    <li> I never expected that this product would perform the way it does. I am really impressed and recommend it. I did not find the smell outputting. The important thing is to follow instructions that are on the top of the bottle&#x27;s cap: \\&quot;Do not shake.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Clears up little bumps overnight and bigger pimples within a couple of days. Love it and will be ordering more for sure! I have no problem with the scent of it, especially since I can go out in public and look people in the eye because I&#x27;m not embarrassed about how my face looks anymore.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! I&#x27;ve purchased this twice and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Do not shake it and apply it just to the spot. It dries out your skin a little so using a moisturizer is a good idea.</li>
    <li> Works amazing on acne caused by stress! Only product I&#x27;ve found to do so. Shrinks blemishes in a few minutes. Works perfect when you feel a blemish start but within a few treatments will eradicate older ones.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product, the only thing that has finally cleared up my skin. Been using this stuff for a little over two weeks &amp; notice a drastic difference. If you&#x27;re hesitant because of the price, consider it a good investment, your skin will thank you a few weeks after using it. I agree with some to guard against the drying by applying a layer of lotion on your face first, I like using coco butter on my face at some point in the day which wards off any drying, but wow, I was beginning to lose hope &amp; thought I would be stuck with bad skin forever until I tried this miracle worker. Surprisingly this has worked wonders for me both as a spot treatment and a preventative as the areas I&#x27;ve applied &amp; treated have remained clear. If it is too drying at first, just take a day or two off til your skin adjusts, but overall this product has surpassed all of drug store products I&#x27;d wasted money on over the years with no where near the same noticeable results. Thank you to this company for making such a great product that truly works, I don&#x27;t even have to wear as much make up anymore, my skin has improved that much in 2 weeks!!</li>
    <li> I started to get acne on my chin in my early 20s after having little to none before that.  I&#x27;m 26 now and have tried Differin, Proactive, Epiduo, Tazorac; none of them really made a difference.  The only thing that ever worked were antibiotics but that only lasted until I stopped taking them.  After using this product for a week I noticed a big difference.  Now, two weeks later my chin has almost completely cleared up.</li>
    <li> My hopes had risen very high beacuse of what others wrote about this product&lt;br /&gt;Most said they had finally found a cure to their cystic acne&lt;br /&gt;However, in my case, it just did not work. I get one huge zit once a month and i fllowed all the product instructions to treat that. But it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;On some of the smaller acne yes it was effective.</li>
    <li> EVERY kid should have this.  Totally saved my kids confidence.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It performs exactly as described.  Has a medicinal smell but packs the power to to the job.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve almost used the entire bottle up and still have yet to notice a difference.  It smells bad, and burns when you first apply it.  It makes your skin extremely dry and tight but its caused me more pimples and aggravated the ones I already had.  MAJOR disappointment, and way too expensive.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite go-to for spot treating acne. as the instructions indicate, do not shake: simply dip a cotton swap down into the bottom and back out. this applies the appropriate ratio of pink eradicating concoction along with the clear alcoholic solution to help it apply onto cleaned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product contains zinc oxide, camphor, and salicylic acid...all good at attempting to calm reddening flare ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;whenever you feel there is the sensation of a potential break out, apply! it will almost always help to avoid it from progressing worse.</li>
    <li> I have had Acne Rosacea for 10yrs. I have spent thousands and countless efforts trying to repair my skin through aruyveda /chinese medicine / organic food &amp; a myriad of topicals. This is hands down the best cure ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice product dries up the start of a blemish immediately.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh this is an absolute godsend. Ive literally tried everything on the market from topical gels to antibiotics and nothing works as well as this. It is drying but thats what you need to kill acne. So worth the money and hype. Look no further. Kate you are a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T SHAKE IT! I think its working on my acne and clearing up acne scars, just have to use  it daily.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on a product before, but this deserves the publicity. I received this yesterday and used it last night before I went to bed. I have mild acne with a few cystic breakouts every now and then. My face wash helped, but not enough to completely get rid of my breakouts and the cystic acne that I had wouldn&#x27;t go away. I read great reviews about EradiKate, so I decided to get over the price and buy it. I woke up this morning and the mild acne spots were dried up and basically invisible. The redness had disappeared and there was no pain or itchiness. The cystic breakout on my chin is significantly better, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it is the size of a regular pimple now! I think with a day or two more of treatment it will be completely gone :) Just a tip: lay a towel over your pillow at night when you use this so the smell doesn&#x27;t migrate to your pillowcase. It smells more of alcohol at first, but when you wake up you&#x27;ll smell the sulfur. It isn&#x27;t unbearable, especially with great results!</li>
    <li> Way to over priced !!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Cleared up blemishes on my chin in just a few days.</li>
