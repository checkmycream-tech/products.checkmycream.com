      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It looks very feminine and supports a great cause.  </li>
      <li>It makes her hair smooth and shiny!</li>
      <li>I am really pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I have to admit, they look cute too.</li>
      <li>but I love it as well.</li>
      <li>All the girls in the house love this girly tool.</li>
      <li>Am I ever glad that I did.</li>
      <li>Product in great condition, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, including the price, which was the main reason for purchase.</li>
      <li>My wife is very happy with this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>The free bag that came with it was HUGE!</li>
      <li>Much better than the price would have you expect - makes hair straightening quick and easy</li>
      <li>my wife loves the straightner and the free bag that came with</li>
      <li>Well worth the investment!</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money, because its 2 in one!</li>
      <li>Love the quality of Chi products and I love pink, so this is the perfect flat iron for me.</li>
      <li>They use it every day, and the price was right too!</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick and well packed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hot and straightens my hair in no time at all.</li>
      <li>This product works far better than others advertised on TV.</li>
      <li>Products get real hot fast and wife says doesn&#x27;t take as much time to straighten hair.</li>
      <li>When everyone feels pretty, everyone benefits.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Love this product for daily straightening and styling.</li>
      <li>This Chi is amazing, if not better, than the other 2 Chi&#x27;s I own.</li>
      <li>it is stylish in a sense -- pink ...  </li>
      <li>Prompt and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to comment on durability, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>I thought the pink color was a nice mild pink with pearly ribbon pattern for breast cancer awareness.</li>
      <li>It works beautifully and efficiently on my hair (I am half black so this says a lot).</li>
      <li>Definately worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>I ordered my new CHI and recieved it within 4 days.</li>
      <li>Then I heard about the Chi, so I thought I would give it a try, since I needed a new straightener.  </li>
      <li>Now it snags on my hair &amp; I need to get a new one.</li>
      <li>I have very thick and curly hair, I have tried many other flatirons and they worked just okay.</li>
      <li>it is FASTER than most other flat irons ( she has tried others )  </li>
      <li>Also, I thought the travel case would be a small case for traveling with the Chi, when it was actually a large pink vinyl tote-very nice overnight bag size,though, except that it says CHI on it.</li>
      <li>repairs are covered for years upon years, she had an old one which the cord/power supply went -- for 35.00 the repair was made out of warranty.  </li>
      <li>As a person whose been affected directly by breast cancer</li>
      <li>I regret it, this doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my other chi and pulls my hair.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly, and straightens faster and easier than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>But after using this Chi for the last month, I will never own a cheap flat iron again!</li>

<li> As someone who owns a chi, I simply couldn&#x27;t pass up the limited edition one.</li>
<li> Much bigger than I expected</li>
<li> It took a long time to straighten my hair with them.</li>
<li> I am from mixed ethnicity and have coarse black hair.   </li>
<li> it also leaves her hair silkier than others - she suffers from frizzier curly hair without this product and is left shinny and smooth with it</li>
<li> And even then my hair felt dry and brittle and smelled burnt.</li>
<li> She wanted a CHI for a long time, but I was not willing to pay over 100 dollars for a flat iron.  </li>
<li> After about 5 years of my wife using this product i can make a few comments as a male:  </li>
<li> Stopped working less than 9 months after I purchased it.</li>
<li> My daughter, however, was not happy I bought a &#x27;pink&#x27; one for her, so it may have to be returned.  </li>
<li> and she uses it everyday!</li>
<li> Needless to say, I ordered mine the next day.</li>
<li> i was afraid that i was going to get ripped-off purchasing a $65 chi.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want to, but rather, my straightener simply stinks.</li>

    <li> It gets really hott and straightens so awesome plus the awesome bag i got I love it! Good decision when purchased</li>
    <li> Prompt and fast delivery. Product in great condition, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, including the price, which was the main reason for purchase.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a Chi before and knew little about the high end flat irons. But after using this Chi for the last month, I will never own a cheap flat iron again! It is amazing! I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to comment on durability, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I ordered my new CHI and recieved it within 4 days. I love it and I saved money by ordering it online.</li>
    <li> Great product, works as advertised. I am from mixed ethnicity and have coarse black hair.   This product works far better than others advertised on TV. I am really pleased with the results.  All this for a great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I received the flat iron in a timely manner but it was a gift and stopped working shortly after it was received. I have sent three e-mails trying to get Beauty Depot to respond so that we can get the problem resolved. Their has been no response to my e-mails so have now had to put in a claim with Amazon.</li>
    <li> After about 5 years of my wife using this product i can make a few comments as a male:  it is FASTER than most other flat irons ( she has tried others )  it is stylish in a sense -- pink ...  it is affordable under 100.00.  repairs are covered for years upon years, she had an old one which the cord/power supply went -- for 35.00 the repair was made out of warranty.  it also leaves her hair silkier than others - she suffers from frizzier curly hair without this product and is left shinny and smooth with it</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and in good condition. I thought the pink color was a nice mild pink with pearly ribbon pattern for breast cancer awareness. My daughter, however, was not happy I bought a &#x27;pink&#x27; one for her, so it may have to be returned.  It was her birthday gift.  Also, I thought the travel case would be a small case for traveling with the Chi, when it was actually a large pink vinyl tote-very nice overnight bag size,though, except that it says CHI on it.</li>
    <li> As a person whose been affected directly by breast cancer I love when I find products that support the cause! This Chi is amazing, if not better, than the other 2 Chi&#x27;s I own.</li>
    <li> This worked great for the first six months, but then the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; started peeling off. The plates look like metal underneath.  Now it snags on my hair &amp; I need to get a new one. Should have know this price was too good to be true for a Chi!</li>
    <li> NO PROBLEMS. JUST AS DESCRIBED.....BEAUTIFUL COLOR.....WORKS SO GREAT WILL NOT USE ANYTHING BUT A CHI....5 STARS...WONDERFUL I LOVE IT,,,THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It looks very feminine and supports a great cause.  Delivery was quick and well packed.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. Definately worth the extra money. I&#x27;ve been through about 10+ straighteners over a 7 year time span, and none of them can even compare to this one. I love it!</li>
    <li> A++++ great product! Great price! Fast shipping! Def buy again! Thanks! Chi is best product on the market in my opinion! Def recommend chi to all women with any kind of hair!!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, and straightens faster and easier than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Much better than the price would have you expect - makes hair straightening quick and easy</li>
    <li> I have chin length curly hair that I have never bothered straightening. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want to, but rather, my straightener simply stinks. It took forever to heat up and do its work on my hair. And even then my hair felt dry and brittle and smelled burnt. I recently visited a friend and when she was straightening her hair I realized how quickly she did it and how amazing her hair looked! So I tried it out and was awestruck. It took me 15 minutes (compared to 45 with mine) and my hair looked beautiful and healthy. The straightener I was using was a Chi! Needless to say, I ordered mine the next day.</li>
    <li> i was afraid that i was going to get ripped-off purchasing a $65 chi. But i was completely wrong, i was fully satisfied. the product was quickly shipped and in great condition. Love this product for daily straightening and styling.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this flat iron.  She wanted a CHI for a long time, but I was not willing to pay over 100 dollars for a flat iron.  She found this one on Amazon.com and we were very happy with the value.  The product arrived promptly and she has been using it every day since.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of Chi products and I love pink, so this is the perfect flat iron for me. It works beautifully and efficiently on my hair (I am half black so this says a lot). The free bag that came with it was HUGE! Much bigger than I expected but I love it as well. It&#x27;s about the size of a carry-on bag for an airplane.</li>
    <li> Stopped working less than 9 months after I purchased it. When it was working, it didn&#x27;t pull my hair and worked well.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Mom who has never owned a Chi but straightens her hair each morning.  Well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I love love love that i can curl and straighten my hair with this! Totally worth the money, because its 2 in one! Not to mention cute and promotes breast cancer awareness! The free bag that came with it is also an awesome duffle for when I go over to my boyfriends!</li>
    <li> All the girls in the house love this girly tool. When everyone feels pretty, everyone benefits. I have to admit, they look cute too. They use it every day, and the price was right too!</li>
    <li> It is in excellent condition and works better than my mothers old Chi hair straightener. Its a perfect gift for any breast cancer survivor, my mother fell in love with this and she uses it everyday!</li>
    <li> my wife loves the straightner and the free bag that came with it was just an added bonus for sure!</li>
    <li> Products get real hot fast and wife says doesn&#x27;t take as much time to straighten hair. Saves time waiting for her lol.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it! It makes her hair smooth and shiny! Great price too!</li>
    <li> As someone who owns a chi, I simply couldn&#x27;t pass up the limited edition one. I regret it, this doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my other chi and pulls my hair. Not sure if this is a real chi.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and curly hair, I have tried many other flatirons and they worked just okay. It took a long time to straighten my hair with them. Then I heard about the Chi, so I thought I would give it a try, since I needed a new straightener.  Am I ever glad that I did. It&#x27;s very hot and straightens my hair in no time at all. The best straightener I ever used.</li>
