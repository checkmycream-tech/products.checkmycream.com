      <li>I really love to hear after 8 hours : &amp;#34;what&#x27;s your flagrance?</li>
      <li>It arrived on time and it smells great and at a much lower price than anywhere else ive seen.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Purchase from a reputable place.</li>
      <li>I was most disgruntled  and unsatisfied</li>
      <li>I have used Jadore for years, love it.</li>
      <li>Scent is lovely and although it may not hold a &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The scent is nice but not like the original.  </li>
      <li>Also, the fragrance lasts for about an hour or two, unlike the genuine fragrance, which lasts most of the day.</li>
      <li>Came very quickly with no problems.</li>
      <li>A staple in eney woman &#x27;s collection of fine fragrance &#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn this scent for years and what arrived in the mail is the genuine article.  </li>
      <li>said it was the original</li>
      <li>The packaging and fragrance both seem authentic at first.</li>
      <li>Clean and fresh!</li>
      <li>Great price and product as expected.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
      <li>just make sure the one you buy is wrapped and not a bootleg.. was my birthday gift to myself...</li>
      <li>This is really amazing, lasting  for hours!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tad pricey, but worth</li>
      <li>NOT HAPPY for that kind of cash!!!</li>
      <li>It is nothing more than barely colored water.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s classy, romantic, popular, original  and Feminine.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Exactly what it should be.</li>
      <li>The real thing!  </li>
      <li>Was exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>The serial numbers on the bottom are consistent with the bottle I had on my dressing table that I bought from the department store as well...  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to squirt 2-3 sprays and it would last all day, this &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; is more like a body mist..</li>
      <li>First clue...</li>
      <li>makes you feel young and fresh!</li>
      <li>but it is a large bottle</li>
      <li>This one here is the real deal.</li>
      <li>you smell really good&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Got the real thing, had the employees at Bloomingdales, Macys and Nordstrom compare it with their copies, and the scent is identical with the one in the stores.</li>
      <li>Long lasting, amazing aroma.</li>
      <li>smell is gone quickly, and not one person has ever smelled it enough to comment on it or ask what</li>
      <li>But then I noticed that the top seal on the cellophane wrapping was missing.</li>
      <li>I normally buy this perfume at Macy&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It turns out that the box is indeed extremely thin for a french original famous perfume, the inside of the box looked ripped.</li>
      <li>Yes.. Same scent but much weaker.</li>
      <li>It goes without saying that :J&#x27;Adore by DIOR is an eternally fashionable perfume with a soft femininity.</li>
      <li>There are many J&#x27;adore Eau De Parfum on here and a lot of negative reviews.</li>
      <li>real stuff same as retail package.</li>
      <li>I contacted Amazon and they were very understanding and issued a refund, but still...pay attention to what you order, especially if you order it as a gift for someone</li>
      <li>Most CHRISTIAN DIOR Perfumes&#x27; pale in comparison with this one.</li>
      <li>It was apparent the plastic lining had been messed with..</li>
      <li>not Jador at all seller got a bad batch from distributor check with seller to make sure she got a new real batch!</li>
      <li>Since I had received the original last time I placed a second order few days back.</li>
      <li>down side is that it&#x27;s a little light.</li>

<li> down side is that it&#x27;s a little light.</li>
<li> Think it is imitation as the bottle looks different from the Macy&#x27;s one.</li>
<li> The box had Jadore &amp;#34;Gold Supreme Limited Edition&amp;#34; Shimmering eau de parfum labeled on the box.  </li>
<li> Some think they may have purchased a knockoff perfume, no ladies, sadly this IS the true state of J&#x27;adore.  </li>
<li> and I received the perfume as expected.</li>
<li> i felt that the box was a little bit too thin than normal.</li>
<li> When it all comes down to it, isnt that what we all want with this purchase?</li>
<li> Seems the product has been watered down or something.</li>
<li> I agree with all  of you who say this perfume is too weak, doesn&#x27;t last is too costly,</li>
<li> I got the feeling that is not original, and went ahead and opened the box to convince myself.</li>
<li> and i even saved a few bucks</li>
<li> and then it goes away in a few hours.</li>
<li> Your money has been wasted.</li>
<li> It seems to wear off after a few hours.</li>
<li> The bottle is also different than the one I purchased from Nordstrom - gold ribs on the cap were too high and the glass was thinner at the base of the bottle.</li>
<li> I ordered this item from amazon a few times in the past, i also purchased this item at Sephora.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it just wears off the skin</li>
<li> Had never tried the Jadore before and still am not sure about the fragance</li>
<li> And its a total fake one.</li>
<li> in order to feel like I can smell it on me I have to spray at least 4</li>
<li> Waste of my money!!</li>
<li> I was disappointed when I received the item in a different box.  </li>
<li> The Middle notes consist of a bouquet of flowers ending with the feminine charm of a sweeter base note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I always buy from Macys or Nordstroms, decided to try to save a few dollars and order online- bad idea.</li>
<li> it is fake.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s fake</li>

    <li> I agree with all  of you who say this perfume is too weak, doesn&#x27;t last is too costly, etc.  Some think they may have purchased a knockoff perfume, no ladies, sadly this IS the true state of J&#x27;adore.  I purchased a bottle from Dillard&#x27;s Dept Store  and WHAT A JOKE!  It is nothing more than barely colored water.  I poured the stuff over my arm waited 5 minutes and friends at work said they could not smell a thing.  For that price I want to people to stop and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  Christian Dior should be sued for fraud.</li>
    <li> Great shipping and product!</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good! Doesn&#x27;t last all day on me but I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Received timely and as stated</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...smells beautiful and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> It goes without saying that :J&#x27;Adore by DIOR is an eternally fashionable perfume with a soft femininity. Most CHRISTIAN DIOR Perfumes&#x27; pale in comparison with this one. I tend  to get a lot of compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s classy, romantic, popular, original  and Feminine.&lt;br /&gt;The composition is built perfectly. The top notes include Pear, Peach, Bergamot and Melon that is lovely.The Middle notes consist of a bouquet of flowers ending with the feminine charm of a sweeter base note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Scent is lovely and although it may not hold a &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; factor it does cause conversation .Perfect for all seasons and is a scent that you could wear 10 years from now, no matter what your age and it&#x27;s still appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that it&#x27;s a little light. It seems to wear off after a few hours. I&#x27;m not sure if it just wears off the skin or if I just become accustomed to the scent because I&#x27;ve still gotten compliments even after I thought it had worn off.  It&#x27;s a tad pricey, but worth it given that it can be worn for all occasions and during all times of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> A staple in eney woman &#x27;s collection of fine fragrance &#x27;s. Not only that but a affordable gift.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this at all it&#x27;s fake not Jador at all seller got a bad batch from distributor check with seller to make sure she got a new real batch! She is very nice and I&#x27;m sure honest just can happen to anyone.</li>
    <li> this perfume was and is a fake.waste of money and trust.i refuse to comment more.</li>
    <li> This  product is a very convincing counterfeit. The packaging and fragrance both seem authentic at first. But then I noticed that the top seal on the cellophane wrapping was missing. The bottle is also different than the one I purchased from Nordstrom - gold ribs on the cap were too high and the glass was thinner at the base of the bottle. Also, the fragrance lasts for about an hour or two, unlike the genuine fragrance, which lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> On checking the authenticity of the  product  I was most disgruntled  and unsatisfied</li>
    <li> Had never tried the Jadore before and still am not sure about the fragance BUT,  my husband loves it and that&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
    <li> Got the real thing, had the employees at Bloomingdales, Macys and Nordstrom compare it with their copies, and the scent is identical with the one in the stores.</li>
    <li> it is fake. Do not buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for several years, so this was a replacement bottle.  It is a very nice frangrance that is not overbearing.  I often receive compliments when I am using it.</li>
    <li> Smells like cat p**s.</li>
    <li> I have used Jadore for years, love it. Came very quickly with no problems.</li>
    <li> Great price and product as expected.  The same product as more expensive brick and mortar stores.</li>
    <li> I always buy from Macys or Nordstroms, decided to try to save a few dollars and order online- bad idea. It was apparent the plastic lining had been messed with.. First clue... Then sprayed the perfume.. Yes.. Same scent but much weaker. Seems the product has been watered down or something. I&#x27;m used to squirt 2-3 sprays and it would last all day, this &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; is more like a body mist..in order to feel like I can smell it on me I have to spray at least 4 and then it goes away in a few hours. So lesson learned.. Purchase from a reputable place. Also can&#x27;t return so once they got your order.. Your money has been wasted.</li>
    <li> as always my wife loved it</li>
    <li> this is a great perfume, it was a bit pricey but it is a large bottle and it is parfum not toilette. just make sure the one you buy is wrapped and not a bootleg.. was my birthday gift to myself...</li>
    <li> Exactly what it should be. It does spray out alot heavier than the smaller sized bottles.</li>
    <li> Smells so yummy!!  Clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> I normally buy this perfume at Macy&#x27;s but I decided to order it online this time.  I&#x27;ve worn this scent for years and what arrived in the mail is the genuine article.  The serial numbers on the bottom are consistent with the bottle I had on my dressing table that I bought from the department store as well...  I&#x27;m glad a took a chance and ordered it online!</li>
    <li> My wife said it does not last like the one she got at Macy&#x27;s. Think it is imitation as the bottle looks different from the Macy&#x27;s one.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received the item in a different box.  The box had Jadore &amp;#34;Gold Supreme Limited Edition&amp;#34; Shimmering eau de parfum labeled on the box.  When I opened it there were sparkles on the bottom.  The directions were to shake the bottle before use.  I guess it was just to make the bottle shimmer.  The scent is nice but not like the original.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay to send it back, so I decided to keep it.  Before I bought it I read the reviews and people said it was the original, so I took there word for it.  I guess some people can&#x27;t read!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item from amazon a few times in the past, i also purchased this item at Sephora. This time the product didn&#x27;t look the same, as soon as i grabbed it i felt that the box was a little bit too thin than normal. I got the feeling that is not original, and went ahead and opened the box to convince myself. It turns out that the box is indeed extremely thin for a french original famous perfume, the inside of the box looked ripped. I contacted Amazon and they were very understanding and issued a refund, but still...pay attention to what you order, especially if you order it as a gift for someone, you don&#x27;t want to look cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Took pics of the box, but i dont see an option on here to attach pics...</li>
    <li> This CAN&#x27;T BE eau de parfum!!! If that were the case, the smell should stay with you for a good while.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is gone quickly, and not one person has ever smelled it enough to comment on it or ask what it was.&lt;br /&gt;Either nobody liked it or nobody ever smelled it! My guess...never smelled it! NOT HAPPY for that kind of cash!!!</li>
    <li> my wife fell in love with this perfume from the first time she experienced it, now i am in love with it. It arrived on time and it smells great and at a much lower price than anywhere else ive seen.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as advertised. Sent in a timely manner</li>
    <li> While Christian Dior as a company has changed their J&#x27;adore recipe over the years. This one here is the real deal. Long lasting, amazing aroma. There are many J&#x27;adore Eau De Parfum on here and a lot of negative reviews. I compared it to the one I bought from a dept store and it is the same.</li>
    <li> I used it for years... I tried to replace it ... just for a change.. but no way!! This is really amazing, lasting  for hours! I really love to hear after 8 hours : &amp;#34;what&#x27;s your flagrance? you smell really good&amp;#34;. I really love it! makes you feel young and fresh!</li>
    <li> She loved, I am a hero. When it all comes down to it, isnt that what we all want with this purchase?</li>
    <li> The real thing!  So pleased.... so very very pleased!!</li>
    <li> I had ordered last year the same one and I received the perfume as expected.Since I had received the original last time I placed a second order few days back.And its a total fake one. The smell isn&#x27;t what it is supposed to be. Waste of my money!!</li>
    <li> real stuff same as retail package. my wife was very happy with this and i even saved a few bucks</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I am very pleased.  A Beautiful Scent.  I love it.  May just have to get some lotion too.  :)</li>
