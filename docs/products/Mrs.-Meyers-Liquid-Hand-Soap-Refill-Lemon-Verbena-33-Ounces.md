<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works good and nice scent. Nice on the skin</li>
    <li> If you want a decent soap, this good, but don&#x27;t expect it to smell anything at all like lemon verbena. I buy many lemon verbena products (it&#x27;s my favorite scent) and have even had the plant in my garden. This soap has a strong, perfumy smell, but there is nothing even remotely like citrus, lemon, or lemon verbena about its scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mrs. Meyers products for some time now and have tried (I think) all of them.&lt;br /&gt;They do a good jhob on cleaning whether it&#x27;s hands, laundry for counter tops and the aromas are not overpowering.</li>
    <li> great product.  smells great!  SUPER FAST shipping too!</li>
    <li> Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Liquid Hand Soap in the Lemon Verbena scent is really refreshing. I received this order on time, and appreciated getting the larger tube so that I could use it for refills</li>
    <li> This was good value in terms of cost per ounce and ease of refills.  But I was replacing a different Lemon Soap that was wonderfully fragrant.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to have any lemon in the scent.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I WANTED to like this soap but I didn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t smell like lemons. It smelled like an artist&#x27;s interpretation of lemons. It smelled pricey but not pretty. I will not be buying Mrs. Meyers again.</li>
    <li> Love the clean smell of Lemon verbena.  Great product and environmentally safe!</li>
    <li> I love that this soap cleans and leaves a nice soft scent.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I wanted a non-antibacterial soap for everyday use around the house that didn&#x27;t dry out my hands and left a pleasant scent. This soap is very gentle and leaves my hands feeling very soft, however the scent is a little strong for my husbands taste. I like everything else about the soap, so next time we&#x27;ll try a different scent to hopefully find one we love.</li>
    <li> So great to have big bottle to refill instead of wasting so many little containers. got here in quick time. we are in love with this scent!!</li>
    <li> Perfect love the scent</li>
    <li> Great product great service.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that we love this stuff.  My son introduced his mom to this about a year ago and this is all she wants to use. Me I&#x27;ll use whatever is handy, but the women folk are concerned with how it leaves their hands so they love this stuff.  Amazon had the best price.</li>
    <li> Nice calming smell and natural. I use it in the so-op amber glass metal soap dispenser in my remodeled bathroom that has a early 1900&#x27;s theme. I would buy this again. I also use Meyer&#x27;s laundry soap.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these products and the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand soap to keep in the bathroom of my business.  It has a fresh clean smell...  love it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick for my simple human auto soap dispenser, I mixed it with some more water and it help. I really like the fragrant though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you&#x27;re okay with hand soap that&#x27;s not greasy or slimy.  This stuff washes off easily &amp; I like that.</li>
    <li> I love this cleaner.  It&#x27;s smells wonderful.  I bought a small bottle and then I refill all the time now.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that I haven&#x27;t been able to find this refill size locally.  I ordered it from amazon as soon as I found it here.  The item pictured is a foil bag - I actually received a plastic jug.  So much sturdier and easier.  The jug is a thin rectangular shape (thinner than a cereal box) so it&#x27;s easier to store. This scent is heavenly. As someone with severe eczema, it is difficult to find a hand soap that leaves hands feeling clean but not stripped of all moisture.  This is the product.  I personally adore this scent - for those who are not a fan of lemony soaps, try Mrs Meyer&#x27;s radish scent - sounds weird but amazing.</li>
    <li> Thought the lemon scent would be much stronger...scent is mostly verbena.  Overall scent is just not strong and does not linger on your hands like other aroma therapy type soaps.  Does not lather well.  I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re buying it for the scent, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed. The smell is chemical and artificial. If you want a good lemon verbena soap, this is not it. Lemon verbena is a flowering plant that is unrelated to the citrus fruit it smells somewhat like. If you just want artificial lemon smell, there are plenty of soaps on the market that will fill the bill.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and can&#x27;t beat the cost!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells soooo good!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  Such a fresh scent.  This refill saves money and I use all the time for everything.</li>
    <li> I use it to refill bottles I have at all sinks.  It&#x27;s gentle to your hands, even for sensitive skins. The lemon verbena scent is refreshing but not too strong.</li>
    <li> I know this product for long time, so it&#x27;s not a new product to me! I really like it and will not change this soap for any other ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great vendor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to this scent.  Yeah, it&#x27;s not really very lemon-y, but it&#x27;s a great scent that seems very natural.  It doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like some floral scents do.  I wish it were cheaper, but it is pretty thick and you can water it down some.</li>
    <li> With the previous packaging, a collapsible bag, i used to lose product each time I refilled hand soap dispenser.  With this new package, no waste of my favorite scent in the Mrs. Meyers.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this soap, fits perfectly in my standard dispenser from target. Easy to store in medicine cabinet since the jug is so shallow.</li>
    <li> The price here on Amazon isn&#x27;t necessarily the best, but these particular refill sizes aren&#x27;t always easy to find and still cheaper than buying new dispensers.</li>
    <li> Great liquid hand cleaner.  Lemon Verbena is a wonderful, fresh scent.  Wish they made the liquid version in a Grapefruit scent.  They do have a gel, but I don&#x27;t feel it would work well in my hand activated dispenser since it&#x27;s designed for liquid and not gels.</li>
    <li> Not only is Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Lemon Verbena Hand Soap earth friendly and not tested on animals, but it&#x27;s a wonderful soap with great lemon verbena fragrance that leaves your hands feeling soft with a lingering hint of lemon verbena.  I&#x27;ve tried several other scents from Mrs. Meyers, but I keep coming back to this one.  It has such a nice, clean smell.  (The dish washing liquid in this fragrance is great too.) [[ASIN:B000E75EQY Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day Dish Soap, Lemon Verbena, Case of 6 - 16 Ounce Bottles (96 Ounces)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love ordering from Amazon in these refill containers because we use them in the main bath, the guest bath and the laundry room sink and this way I don&#x27;t run out as quickly. Great product!</li>
    <li> The packaging was not sufficient and the seal on the bottle was broken due to the bottle being loose in the box. Soap spilled inside the box and was a mess. Unfortunately, this item was part of a gift and will now be mine since I&#x27;d hate to give a half empty bottle of soap.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Not a lot for the money but it goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot per use.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of antibacterial or antiviral soap, I feel using such a soap is what is creating \\&quot;super bugs\\&quot; in children these days. It is not that easy to find a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soap that cleans hands well and smells good. I love the smell, crisp and clean, and it gets the dirtiest hands clean!! Plus the packaging is great for refilling all the hand soap containers in our home.</li>
    <li> I love that it is organic.  I actually used it for a bug repellent again the little biting black flies.  The smell is great and refreshing, and it does not leave any residue.  I am using it now for the hand washing.  I will buy more!</li>
    <li> love the fragrance and the fact it is refillable</li>
    <li> Great value for a produce we already use.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Keeps your hands clean.  What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really love the smell.</li>
    <li> My family likes this soap very much, and it&#x27;s a great, economical way to keep liquid soap dispensers filled, but watch the price on this carefully...also, shipping: prices can vary widely depending on seller.</li>
    <li> This product is hard for me to find for some reason in my area (and I am not willing to drive to multiple stores), so the fact that it is available here at a fair price is great for me!</li>
    <li> this product line is all good. Well priced, love the refill option!!!!</li>
    <li> smells great, cleans wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many of the 12.5 oz bottles of this soap. I thought I&#x27;d save some money by buying this refill, but I must have got a bad lot, because this doesn&#x27;t smell like the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Lemon Verbena I&#x27;ve purchased before. It&#x27;s barely smells like anything. It&#x27;s kinda gross; I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like Mrs. Meyers hand soaps.  Their Lemon Verbena scent in the hand soap is my favorite.  Simple as that.</li>
    <li> But this soap SMELLS great. Our is the only fragrance of this brand I&#x27;ve tried, but I love it. It is bright and sunny and makes me smile whenever I wash my hands.</li>
    <li> Removes grime and grease with NO leftover residue. Surpasses all supermarket cleaners. Leaves hands soft and moist. No dryness. Meant for kitchen, not garage. Pleasant scent not overpowering. Lightning fast shipping..........</li>
    <li> I use this in foam pump refills with added water and it is still smooth and silky.  Kids love it and wash more often.</li>
    <li> This soap is overpowering. I used it sparingly and all I smell is the scent and nothing else. I&#x27;m in my car driving with the windows open and I can still smell it. That&#x27;s how strong this stuff is.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and price.</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted, and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> This was like the cheapest soap refill that I could find... it does work good so no complaints there. However, I&#x27;m not too crazy about it&#x27;s smell, thus 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Smells more like evergreen trees than lemon verbena.  Not surprising when one checks the ingredients (which do NOT include verbena!)  Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, and I love this soap, and I&#x27;m an intelligent adult, so you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be able to understand the size of the bottle by the oz listed.  Somehow, I looked at the photo and thought &amp;#34;Great! A big refill jug at a fantastic price!&amp;#34;  Well, not so big.  Still a great product, but will ration this to the master and guest baths and use the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; stuff everywhere else in the house.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and smell of this soap.  I wish it was a little more affordable, but in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My family loves this soap for washing hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy this product exists and we can save a little money on a soap we love. It&#x27;s a little tough to pour into the Mrs Meyers pump bottles, but it saves money!</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Its a nice replacement to buying the actual bottle every three months. Its actually more smaller than what its actually displayed on the website, so its better to but the three liter ones, instead of this one.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this product years and years ago. Cleans and softens. Lemon scent is wonderful. Great product.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, works well while also being a milder soap. Will fill all my hand soap dispensers with Mrs. Meyers soap. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is great soap. It lasts longer than many other brands, you only need a little squirt.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a refill for my favorite kitchen soap. Nice light (note LIGHT) scent. Soft on skin. Refill was smaller than I was expecting (its only 33oz) but I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s organic.  I read that the key ingredient, triclosan, in antibacterial handsoap has safety issues, so I stopped using antibacterial handsoap and turned to organic instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say if the organic handsoap is effective in killing germs, but so far, I like the smell and am hoping it kills germs too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap. It cleans well and smells good. Also the bottle has a cap with a small spout so it&#x27;s easy to refill a soap dispenser. I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Above average cleaning and nice feel but the smell got kind of tired and my family did not like it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it feels so good on hands.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find the dispenser bottles of this soap locally so I just ordered the refill. I love the smell of this soap!!</li>
    <li> wish were a little thicker, but enjoy smell</li>
    <li> I use soap dispensers at all sinks in my house, and prefer this hand soap. Amazon carries it at a good price. Problem solved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting used to the scent. It seems like there is a hint if cardomum though it&#x27;s not mentioned on the ingredients.</li>
    <li> not worth the money.. doesn&#x27;t smell anything like lemon, it has a weird scent to it and not a good one</li>
    <li> The Mrs. Meyers Liquid hand soap arrived on time and as promised. I have been using Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s clean day hand soap and love the lemon Verbena. Will be back for more. Thank you Caldrea Company &amp; Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Meyers Lemon Vervena. The description states (6 x 33 oz.) I received ONE not SIX 33 oz. container. Where are my other FIVE??????????</li>
    <li> I love all Mrs. Meyers products, especially because they don&#x27;t contain the harsh chemicals of other brands, flushing down into our sewer and water systems. Only need a small amount. Work wonderfully. Lemon smells great.</li>
    <li> Bought this to refill gift from Christmas.  My husband loves this to wash his hands, frequently!</li>
    <li> We love these products from Mrs. Meyers. A bit costly, but worth it and less expensive than in the stores.</li>
    <li> The least scent this soap had, was that of lemons.  Wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this hand soap. I find the scent to be very clean and refreshing. This big jug is great. It almost fills the big dispenser I keep in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  I like this soap and if I can get more soap for less $ (while reducing the amount of plastic I have) it&#x27;s a win-win for me!  Shipping was quick and there was no damage to the bottle.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like Mrs. Meyers products.  They are priced well and smell great without being overwhelming.  Now if I could just find a cute dispenser...</li>
    <li> Great product. Clean your hands fast and is good for the environment.</li>
    <li> Always buy this product.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this soap, but I don&#x27;t like that it does not lather.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a refill on hand.  Great smell and nice to use daily in my kitchen.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love the smell.  I&#x27;ve benn buying the same product for a while now - hope it will never be dicontinued:-)</li>
    <li> Our family loves this soap and feel great about the ingredients. Never drying.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap. Fresh lemons. Truly lovely. Everything feels clean and nice. But the size of this refill is...well..teeny tiny. And then the price. Is it worth it? Uh...no. It&#x27;s just soap. I miss the smell, but my wallet is better for it.</li>
    <li> Gentle with lovely, clean aroma!</li>
    <li> Has a nice fresh scent that isn&#x27;t too either perfumey or chemical.  I don&#x27;t understand why this bulk refill isn&#x27;t sold in stores?</li>
    <li> This soap dried my hands out so badly that they nearly started cracking. My girlfriend&#x27;s hands actually DID crack and bleed because they were so dry. We now put hand lotion on after every use and our hands are back to normal. This is completely unacceptable. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
