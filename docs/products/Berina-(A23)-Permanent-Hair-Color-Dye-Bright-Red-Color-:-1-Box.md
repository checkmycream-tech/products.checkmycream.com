    <li> Not has the red red I saw in the picture, I dont like so much.</li>
    <li> Color comes out great even on dark hair, hardly lasted through one wash.</li>
    <li> The color wasn&#x27;t as bright as it shows in the picture and I had even bleached it prior to dying it, the color had a bit of a brownish tone to it. It also started to wash out within a couple weeks and left parts of my hair pinkish orange. Shipping also took waaay too long and to be honest it was not worth the wait at all, I prefer Splat or Manic Panic over this</li>
    <li> Not really a bright red...</li>
    <li> Excellent product, delivered quicker than expected!</li>

    <li> It took 2-3 weeks for it to arrive and I was hoping to get this bright red I even bleach my hair and it came out orange maybe I didn&#x27;t bleach it enough I don&#x27;t know but will not be repurchasing</li>
    <li> It sucked..my hair became like orange and it fainted..</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I love it I love how long it lasts. Everyone is always jealous of my hair color.  Absolutely my fave!</li>
    <li> Horrible, and it was leaking when opened ... Not made in usa and is not worth 10.84,, more like 2.84.</li>
    <li> What you will need that is not included with the dye is- a pair of gloves, a plastic mixing bowl. Not metal do to a chemical interaction. As well as plastic stir stick and application brush. Do not wash your hair first being this dries it out like tumbleweed. Have thick conditioner on hand. Rinse but do not shampoo and just use conditioner. It does not look the same on all hair types. Mine looked nice being my hair is dark. But it washes out very quick. I use dry shampoo to make it last longer. For a longer affect bleach your hair and leave it for a week to relax then use this product. I will not be using it again and will go back to other brands. It was a mess and stains. I have been doing my hair and my friends hair for years. I rate 3 stars being it arrived in a nice package and faster than expected. This is a product that is not made in the USA. The description tells you that. So instructions vary from site to site.</li>
    <li> I have dyed the underneath of my hair red for over a year now and still bleeds...I just dyed my hair this color last week and shoes not bleed at all I can even wash it with my blonde amd does not bleed into it..I will continue to buy this product it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> Product was a nice red-orange.  My hair was already very red...previously bleached blonde then dyed red from another company.  I purchased this product to use on my roots as the other product did not dye my roots.  This product dyed my roots (dark blond) a nice red-orange.  It did fade soonish...even though I washed every 3-4 days in cold water and used a red shampoo.  It didn&#x27;t look like the girl on the box but it wasn&#x27;t a bad color either.  Perhaps it would have been more red if I started lighter.</li>
    <li> The dye took very well to my hair  and even dyed my roots evenly. I was very happy with the outcome</li>
    <li> im glad i DID NOT put this in my hair never freaking buy this EVERY after i mixed in everything with in 5 minutes it bubbled up and turned into this weird stringy foam gunk. save your hair! do not get this... horrible</li>
    <li> Fades pretty quick. If you don&#x27;t have bleached out hair you won&#x27;t see the color as much.</li>
    <li> definitely a go to shade I keep when formulating my red shade. Worth the wait to ship</li>
    <li> Meh....Arrived sooner that the estimated time.It&#x27;s not the vivid red that I was hoping for.It&#x27;s just a quite dark red colour.I had bleached ends before I dyed them and it didn&#x27;t really cover them.Some parts still look bleached after dying them.Not so happy...</li>
    <li> The color is absolutely AMAZING!  However, it starts to fade after just one wash :/  But, really nice if you&#x27;re just wanting to do something for a special one night occasion!</li>
