    <li> This review is coming from a mother who is in a constant battle with her toddler about getting into daddy&#x27;s cologne. He loves that he gets to be like daddy and wear it. The smell is actually a great smell for children. It smells like a diluted version of an adult cologne and I love this because I wouldn&#x27;t let him wear it if it were overpowering. So please keep this in mind when you read reviews about it not smelling or stinks. It is a very natural &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; smell. The smell does last all day which is very surprising. Overall I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son  that&#x27;s wasting money it doesn&#x27;t smells good at all is same like water</li>
    <li> I was so nervous because of the mixed reviews... but I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. It was a birthday gift for my nephew and a real hit. His mom had to limit him to 2 squirts a day and store the rest on a high shelf. She tells me that the fragrance actually is not that bad and the cute bottle is everything. Buy!!</li>

One whif of this and the ladies look at me like they want to make out in the rain while I hang upside down suspended from a string of twine produced from my own body.  I&#x27;d recommend resisting the urge to try this, and just trying to get there numbers.  Then you&#x27;re just a few will-timed emoticons away from glory my friends.</li>
    <li> Good for Kids... now they have interest in fragrances.</li>
