      <li>I have used shea butter before, and do think it is a great product.  </li>
      <li>The texture is great.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Good Shea butter.  </li>
      <li>Good purchase.</li>
      <li>Good on skin without any adverse reactions.</li>

      <li>and I do hope to buy more!</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely an amazing product</li>
      <li>I use it as my daily/nightly moisturizer, and I just started using it on my hair with nice effect.</li>
      <li>It is still usable, but seems to take longer to warm up in my hand so I can apply it.</li>
      <li>What you need to do is mix it with olive oil to get it to kind of a paste consistency, and THEN you can apply it to you hair.</li>
      <li>It also comes in a nice container that doesn&#x27;t crack or break easily.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep it simple, this is a great, quality, must have product!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a product of Ghana which seems to be the best shea butter overall.</li>
      <li>Love it for my biracial daughter and son.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m SO glad</li>
      <li>My skin and hair are soooo soft and feel great after 7 days.</li>
      <li>This shea butter is a bit pricey but the texture is fantastic and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>My product was shorted not the full amount</li>
      <li>And let me tell you, my hair is so soft and my curls are so nice and defined.</li>
      <li>The butter gets warm in my hands and instantly melts and glides on my skin smoothly.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
      <li>This is the very first time I have ever ordered shea butter.</li>
      <li>It heals the skin and leaves it your skin feeling soft looking beautiful and feeling years younger</li>
      <li>again I&#x27;m so proud of my skin and how this Shea butter has restored it back to its natural heathy state.</li>
      <li>and I instantly fell in love with the smooth silky texture and how it just melted into my skin.</li>
      <li>This Shea Butter is the REAL DEAL!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used shea butter</li>
      <li>First time using your brand</li>
      <li>My friend from school came over one evening and brought me a strange gift, at the time I didn&#x27;t realise it would be my most favoured gift.</li>
      <li>My feet are super soft, my hands and face are too.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended product for every household!</li>
      <li>If  every customer is  &amp;#34; a tiny bit short&amp;#34;  they make &amp;#34;a tiny bit more money&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>well it was more than a tiny bit short.</li>
      <li>Unrefined, natural and real.</li>
      <li>I like the feel of the butter, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s healing my scrapes any better than neosporin or cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>My skin is softer and I&#x27;m sure that after a few weeks my skin will be toned and softer!</li>
      <li>The butter is good straight out of the jar, little bit hard but quite usable</li>
      <li>The Arizona desert really dries out my skin, but this product has been the only one to help my flaky skin.</li>
      <li>Being a member of the natural hair community, I&#x27;ve had friends extoll the virtues of shea butter since forever.</li>
      <li>This shea butter made the perfect base for my homemade organic whipped body butter.</li>
      <li>Thought I would search for a new one and finally decided to purchase from CheMekx.</li>
      <li>At first I was reluctant to try something new as all the other lotions were an epic fail,but my friend encouraged me to take a little into my hand</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it simple, this is a great, quality, must have product!  My skin and hair are soooo soft and feel great after 7 days.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase! My skin is softer and I&#x27;m sure that after a few weeks my skin will be toned and softer!</li>
    <li> I have used shea butter before, and do think it is a great product.  First time using your brand and I found it to be grainy.  It is still usable, but seems to take longer to warm up in my hand so I can apply it.</li>
    <li> The texture is great.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used shea butter and I loved it.  The Arizona desert really dries out my skin, but this product has been the only one to help my flaky skin.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is the REAL DEAL! I had purchased a different kind on Amazon two years ago and it smelled horribly. Thought I would search for a new one and finally decided to purchase from CheMekx. I am extremely pleased! The butter gets warm in my hands and instantly melts and glides on my skin smoothly. I will continue to use this product for years to come. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I truly have been using shea butter since forever and I do mean forever! I do prefer the unrefined raw than the store bought.</li>
    <li> Love it for my biracial daughter and son. They use it in their hair and on their body. It works well for both of them. If your searching for the one product to work for you biracial hair and skin, give this a try.</li>
    <li> My product was shorted not the full amount and they said  &amp;#34;as you can imagine when producing over 1000 jars at a time maybe 1 might have been a tiny bit short&amp;#34;  well it was more than a tiny bit short. I weigh all my product. If  every customer is  &amp;#34; a tiny bit short&amp;#34;  they make &amp;#34;a tiny bit more money&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is a bit pricey but the texture is fantastic and easy to use.  It also comes in a nice container that doesn&#x27;t crack or break easily.  It&#x27;s also a product of Ghana which seems to be the best shea butter overall.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with incredibly dry skin for the past 6 years and I have tried every lotion advertised with no luck, they would marginally help then my skin would get dry and flakey again. I was so sick and tired of feeling so unattractive and flakey. I would deliberately decline invites out with friends because of my skin and how disgusting it looked. My friend from school came over one evening and brought me a strange gift, at the time I didn&#x27;t realise it would be my most favoured gift. She bought me this Shea butter that she said she had bought from a company called chemekx on amazon.com. It was only half a tub as she was actually using it herself. At first I was reluctant to try something new as all the other lotions were an epic fail,but my friend encouraged me to take a little into my hand and I instantly fell in love with the smooth silky texture and how it just melted into my skin. Regardless of wether it works or not I loved the feel of the butter. So I took the tub and started using it daily. I was amazed by the condition of my skin after just 1 week. It&#x27;s been 5 weeks and the tub that was given to me is almost finished so I ordered another so that i wouldn&#x27;t be a day without it. I feel like a woman again I&#x27;m so proud of my skin and how this Shea butter has restored it back to its natural heathy state. I would definitely recommend this Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Being a member of the natural hair community, I&#x27;ve had friends extoll the virtues of shea butter since forever. So on a whim, I decided to try this. I&#x27;m SO glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a warning: you can&#x27;t use this by itself in your hair. It&#x27;s WAY too thick for that and will just weigh your hair down and make it stiff. What you need to do is mix it with olive oil to get it to kind of a paste consistency, and THEN you can apply it to you hair. And let me tell you, my hair is so soft and my curls are so nice and defined. It&#x27;s definitely an amazing product and I do hope to buy more!</li>
    <li> The butter is good straight out of the jar, little bit hard but quite usable but if you melt it to add anything it turns very dry and grainy.</li>

    <li> A wonderful quality product at a great price! Product arrived quickly and was as described. This shea butter made the perfect base for my homemade organic whipped body butter. I will be purchasing this product again !</li>
    <li> Very good product. Unrefined, natural and real. I would buy again. Good on skin without any adverse reactions. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the very first time I have ever ordered shea butter. I am absolutely in love with it! It has so many uses and works great. It literally melts in your hands. My feet are super soft, my hands and face are too. Highly recommended product for every household!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It heals the skin and leaves it your skin feeling soft looking beautiful and feeling years younger</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it as my daily/nightly moisturizer, and I just started using it on my hair with nice effect.</li>
    <li> This is very good Shea butter.  I bought some once before from maybe a health food store or on line and it smelled bad and was gunky.  I didn&#x27;t like to use it and gave it to my husband some to use but he didn&#x27;t like it either.  I think we through it away and got this.  We both are very pleased with this.  Good purchase.Good Shea butter.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> To be fair, this is a great product. I just don&#x27;t understand why the price has doubled within nine months. Soon I will be priced out.</li>
