      <li>I Love the way it feels.  </li>
      <li>and I love helping the women that makes this in Africa.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Being accepted by the ASBI was one of the most important things I read to look for.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to rub on.</li>
      <li>it melts into a silky oil that spreads easily.</li>
      <li>my skin feels so soft after just one evening&#x27;s use, its amazing!</li>
      <li>it was delivered quickly!</li>
      <li>I bought this butter full price on my own after much research, and I am so glad I didn&#x27;t let the size vs. the price stop me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  light and and has somewhat of a whipped consistency.  </li>
      <li>It really keeps my skin looking nice.</li>
      <li>It is malleable and easy to use even in cool temperatures.</li>
      <li>You are getting high- quality shea butter in a nice tin</li>
      <li>All I do is take my fingernail (or plastic knife) and scrape as much as I need off of the top.  </li>
      <li>It also has an earthy, nutty aroma that quickly fades and isn&#x27;t offensive at all.  </li>
      <li>I put some Shea Butter in a bowl and mix in just a few drops of Coconut Oil to a smooth consistency,  works great.  </li>
      <li>First of all--I put it on before bed and after the first night of doing this I woke up with plump and glowy skin!!  </li>
      <li>I have dry flaky skin, this isn&#x27;t a miracle worker but does feel good.</li>
      <li>Works well on its own or mixed with something.  </li>
      <li>Love how soft my skin feels after using this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my skin- especially right after bathing with African Black soap (Out of Africa brand) because the soap tends to dry the skin, and this shea butter is THEE answer to combat the dryness.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It absorbs very quickly, and leaves your skin silky soft.</li>
      <li>So far its working fine i am using it</li>
      <li>(in the summer it is hot</li>
      <li>I have tried many different</li>
      <li>Shea Butter is amazing in general as a natural anti microbial and anti viral as well as being a natural sunscreen--but this Shea butter literally leaves my skin plump and glowing.  </li>
      <li>(it can feel slightly gritty if you don&#x27;t warm it enough first)-</li>
      <li>This is the real stuff...great .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper than the skin products I used to use too.</li>
      <li>High vibration Shea Butter!  </li>
      <li>its the real deal</li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;re mainly just playing for the tin can</li>
      <li>This is a good value for the money - the container is very large (16 ounces), and you only need a very small amount.</li>
      <li>that does not mean it is or is prepared correctly.  </li>
      <li>Love that it is raw and wild.</li>
      <li>This product is ok but is not suitable for use all over your body.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so thankful for the ladies in Ghana who work SO HARD to make this butter mostly by hand.  </li>
      <li>As a girl who is into products but does&#x27;t like to have a complicated daily regieme--I am really happy with the all-in-one results that I am getting from this Shea Butter.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels extremely soft.</li>
      <li>I have a bit of acne and this shea butter is improving it and making my face soft and with a uniform tone.</li>
      <li>can that holds it nicely and keeps it from being a mess all over the place when the room temperature goes up and it begins to slightly melt.  </li>
      <li>Has really helped my dry skin.</li>
      <li>After only 3 weeks of use, the skin on my face looks younger, and this product is straight from a tree.  </li>

<li> A little bit of this will go a long way, so this 16 oz jar will las you a while!</li>
<li> so good some just terrible</li>

<li> I have milia on my face (very tiny hard bumps, but they aren&#x27;t acne), and I have small patches of eczema on my arms-</li>

<li> It is a very hard cream and it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> This product reminds me to slow down because the granules need time to melt with message.  </li>
<li> It comes firmly packed, and looks to be a bit hard to use-</li>
<li> (use small amounts sparingly if you want a drier feel).  </li>
<li> Although the label, at least on mine, does not say it&#x27;s ASBI certified.</li>
<li> The butter is really thick and does not melt fully when rubbed onto skin.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
<li> They were either too hard to rub on, smell bad or not as moisturizing.</li>
<li> My home is cold so the Shea Butter is not spreading consistency</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a good value for the money - the container is very large (16 ounces), and you only need a very small amount. The consistency in the container is almost like play dough, but once you get the product in your hands it melts into a silky oil that spreads easily. It melts with your body heat.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs very quickly, and leaves your skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff is interesting. It really keeps my skin looking nice. It is not like it makes my skin glow but it keeps the lines at bay without making my skin breakout. I use it to help prevent lines and it seems to be working. I put it around my problem areas twice a day. It is a very hard cream and it lasts a long time. I think I will reorder once I use it all.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea Butter.  It&#x27;s  light and and has somewhat of a whipped consistency.  I Love the way it feels.  A little bit of this will go a long way, so this 16 oz jar will las you a while! Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different she butters so good some just terrible but I can honestly say that this is the best one.  Quality, packaging, everything. Look no further.</li>
    <li> Love that it is raw and wild.</li>
    <li> Great quality, and it was delivered quickly! I can&#x27;t wait to use this!</li>
    <li> Love how soft my skin feels after using this.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several different brands of shea butter and I&#x27;ve disliked every one I&#x27;ve ordered until now. They were either too hard to rub on, smell bad or not as moisturizing. I am so happy I found this one. It is the BEST shea butter!!!! I absolutely LOVE it! It is easy to rub on. My skin feels extremely soft. Not only is the product awesome but the customer service (TopGoods) is excellent!!!! I will definitely recommend this product and will order again.</li>
    <li> Like this product still using it</li>
    <li> I love it. As good a the best brands out there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s improving the texture &amp; health of my skin.  This product reminds me to slow down because the granules need time to melt with message.  The necessary message aspect helps my blood flow as well as my mind unwind and relax.  I love how it makes me feel.  After only 3 weeks of use, the skin on my face looks younger, and this product is straight from a tree.  Who would have thought?  Thank you Mother Nature.  It&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper than the skin products I used to use too. The only heads up I would give is the granules (before they&#x27;re melted) can drop on the counter or floor and make it greasy.  So maybe message in an empty tub, or on a towel, or somewhere that can control the droppings if that happens.  Great product.  Great service.</li>
    <li> Seriously, as a licensed Master Esthetician, this is the only thing that you need for your skin. My go-to for essentially everything. And this company is awesome. A great product and you are supporting a great company. 24 Karate, keep it up.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!!</li>
    <li> A friend told me that Shea butter stopped fingernails from breaking. It does. Every three or four days does the trick. This container is enough for years!</li>
    <li> So far its working fine i am using it i have only had it for about a week i can&#x27;t give a five star yet</li>
    <li> absolutely loved it but it&#x27;s a little expensive I think you&#x27;re mainly just playing for the tin can</li>
    <li> This product is ok but is not suitable for use all over your body. The butter is really thick and does not melt fully when rubbed onto skin. It is great for feet.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Makes my face look oily but learning how much/little to apply.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as described. Although the label, at least on mine, does not say it&#x27;s ASBI certified.</li>
    <li> Pretty Great. I got this as a gift, I like the packaging. I have dry flaky skin, this isn&#x27;t a miracle worker but does feel good.</li>
    <li> I read everything I could find before ordering this Shea Butter because I had read that just becaouse it says it is 100% this or that does not mean it is or is prepared correctly.  This one is accepted by the American Shea Butter Institute.  Being accepted by the ASBI was one of the most important things I read to look for.  Anyway I am happy with this product.  Works well on its own or mixed with something.  My home is cold so the Shea Butter is not spreading consistency (in the summer it is hot so it will probably be a spreading consistency).  I put some Shea Butter in a bowl and mix in just a few drops of Coconut Oil to a smooth consistency,  works great.  Has really helped my dry skin.</li>
    <li> GLOWING!!!  High vibration Shea Butter!  This is the most incredible Shea Butter I have every used!  As a girl who is into products but does&#x27;t like to have a complicated daily regieme--I am really happy with the all-in-one results that I am getting from this Shea Butter.  First of all--I put it on before bed and after the first night of doing this I woke up with plump and glowy skin!!  This Shea butter has healed my occasional pimples and balanced my oil production (I have combination skin).  Shea Butter is amazing in general as a natural anti microbial and anti viral as well as being a natural sunscreen--but this Shea butter literally leaves my skin plump and glowing.  I also appreciate its soft-whipped texture.  It is malleable and easy to use even in cool temperatures.</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff...great .</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love this product!!! I can&#x27;t wait to buy more. If your thinking of buying this product don&#x27;t just think it buy it!You won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> does not have  use by date for shelf life.</li>
    <li> I just received this butter yesterday, and I just HAD to leave a review today!! Its sooooo good!! my skin feels so soft after just one evening&#x27;s use, its amazing! I cannot stop touching myself!! :-) So yes, it is a tad more expensive that some other brands out there, BUT! You are getting high- quality shea butter in a nice tin can that holds it nicely and keeps it from being a mess all over the place when the room temperature goes up and it begins to slightly melt.  It comes firmly packed, and looks to be a bit hard to use- but it is not.  All I do is take my fingernail (or plastic knife) and scrape as much as I need off of the top.  I rub it in my hands to warm it to make it melt into a nice consistency to rub in (it can feel slightly gritty if you don&#x27;t warm it enough first)- and then I massage it in!  I use it on my face and body.  It&#x27;s perfect for my skin- especially right after bathing with African Black soap (Out of Africa brand) because the soap tends to dry the skin, and this shea butter is THEE answer to combat the dryness.  I have milia on my face (very tiny hard bumps, but they aren&#x27;t acne), and I have small patches of eczema on my arms- I am noticing they are softening after just one day!  It does have a slightly oily feel, but it absorbs well after a few minutes so it doesn&#x27;t bother me (use small amounts sparingly if you want a drier feel).  It also has an earthy, nutty aroma that quickly fades and isn&#x27;t offensive at all.  It is amazing stuff!  and no, I was not paid in any way for this review.  I bought this butter full price on my own after much research, and I am so glad I didn&#x27;t let the size vs. the price stop me.  I&#x27;m so thankful for the ladies in Ghana who work SO HARD to make this butter mostly by hand.  My skin is forever grateful! I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Amazing for my skin ! I have a bit of acne and this shea butter is improving it and making my face soft and with a uniform tone. its the real deal and I love helping the women that makes this in Africa.</li>
