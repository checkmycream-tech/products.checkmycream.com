      <li>It works good, but I would not purchase again.</li>
      <li>I even tried The art of shaving and although it was a good shaving cream it did not come close to this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Truefitt &amp; Hill shave cream by itself to see how good it truly is.</li>
      <li>This is good shaving cream I use with a brush to lather in the palm of my hand before applying to my face.  </li>
      <li>Also this is unscented, so its great with your favorite scented after shave/cologne.</li>
      <li>It makes my face feel amazing.  </li>
      <li>Amazing shave cream.</li>
      <li>Very good stuff - highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this a try and except for the higher price, this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Leathers up very good, the razors just glides on my skin, fragrance free, just what I expected from these guys, a great shaving cream.</li>
      <li>It has always provided me with the closest of shaves and is in my top five of &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; shaving creams.</li>
      <li>This cream minimizes nicks and cuts and I almost get none on my neck any more.</li>
      <li>; but the product was the Aftershave Balm once more.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
      <li>and I have used it as on of my shaving creams for more than five</li>
      <li>But it ain&#x27;t cheap!  </li>
      <li>This is a product that is great for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>He finds it  very hydrating and the lack of a scent is good for him.</li>
      <li>It lathers up quite easily and has a bit of a lavender smell when applied, but after rinsing there is no scent.</li>
      <li>Somehow it seems to lather some on its own during my first pass.  </li>
      <li>I normally use proraso but have heard good reviews of the Truefitt &amp; Hill.</li>
      <li>this product as the cream in the formula produces fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used it with a regular cartridge razor (Gillette Pro Glide) and still got a great shave.</li>
      <li>I used this with and without a brush and got a comfortable, close shave with each method.</li>
      <li>Just a small amount placed in a mug, scuttle, or bowl - on on your face or brush if you fave lather - and you will get an excellent lather.  </li>
      <li>It makes an immediate and very noticeable difference in smoothness and in closeness - you can get much closer much more easily and more comfortably.  </li>
      <li>outstanding product, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes it is difficult to add just the right amount of water for the perfect lather, but I suppose that is the case with most shaving creams.  </li>
      <li>Has a light fragrance that dissipates right after use, which is a positive for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaper to buy in the larger size tub, but that takes more shelf space in my bathroom and isn&#x27;t available on Subscribe and Save.</li>
      <li>Even when I&#x27;m traveling and only use my electric shaver instead of my nice brush and safety razor.  </li>
      <li>My wife is quite sensitive to strong scents, which is why I was looking for an unscented cream.  </li>
      <li>I will say that Amazon&#x27;s customer service is excellent and both times refunded my money with no issues whatsoever, but something is wrong between the ordering and fulfillment process.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many but always come back to Truefitt &amp; Hill.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with wet shaving, and I&#x27;ve only tried a couple of shaving creams, but I am generally happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>However, the size of it (large) makes it impractical for travel purposes.  </li>
      <li>I use a Schick Quattro razor, a stainless steel soap bowl, a Mason Pearson pure badger shaving brush, Truefitt &amp; Hill</li>
      <li>With a dime-sized dollop, this shave cream quickly builds up a thick, rich lather in a cup and provides a smooth and well lubricated shave.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much and gives you such a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>While there are many different creams out there, and I&#x27;ve tried a few, I fell in love with this one.  </li>
      <li>It really just tabs a dab</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost difference over the Taylor of Bond Sensitive Skin shaving cream.</li>
      <li>I alternate using it with a more prosaic and lots cheaper similar item, and wish that I could feel like I could afford to use this right along.  </li>
      <li>High quality.  </li>
      <li>The biggest downside of this T&amp;H product is the high cost.  </li>
      <li>would give the product five stars as a home product but only four stars because the size is so large it takes up too much room when you travel and exceeds the size permitted in carry on baggage.</li>
      <li>Particularly well suited for a soft silver tip badger brush.  </li>
      <li>- I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it could get any better than this.  </li>
      <li>More consistent lathers that with taylor of bond (and I have in Missouri where the water is VERY hard).    </li>
      <li>I tried the Taylor of Bond Sensitive Skin too.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to find a shave cream that produces such a thick and luxurious lather so quickly.  </li>

<li> You cannot go wrong with Truefitt &amp; Hill!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  It works good, but I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shave cream for two years now (and I&#x27;ve loads of others) - it lasts a long time, as very little is needed per shave (a tiny bit mixed with water and you&#x27;re all set) - I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s kept me from ingrown hairs and redness - cannot recommend it enough -</li>
    <li> This stuff gives me the smoothest shaves ever.  It just take a small amount, so it lasts a long time, which is good, because it&#x27;s really expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for the past 12 years and tried almost every shaving gel over the counter or shaving creams like lab series or bill jealousy and I can say with confidence this is the best product ever for shaving. I even tried The art of shaving and although it was a good shaving cream it did not come close to this one. This cream minimizes nicks and cuts and I almost get none on my neck any more. I used Mach III and together they are great. I am going to decide to order their aftershave soon.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy 5:00 o&#x27;clock shadow, prefer a shaved head and have sensitive skin. This is superior shaving cream and the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream (6 oz jar, unscented) I use a Schick Quattro razor, a stainless steel soap bowl, a Mason Pearson pure badger shaving brush, Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Pre-Shave Oil (or Clarins Shave Ease Oil), Van Der Hagen hypo allergenic shave soap and Neutrogena Post Shave Lotion. I shave every day per my business meeting requirements but often don&#x27;t shave for two or three days when completing project assignments and/or don&#x27;t have meetings. Because of how often I shave and the cost of the Truefitt &amp; Hill shave cream, I use the shave cream with Van Der Hagen shave soap. A small dab of Truefitt &amp; Hill shave cream mixed in with the Van Der Hagen shave soap  lather is absolutely perfect for my shaving requirements.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Truefitt &amp; Hill shave cream by itself to see how good it truly is. It&#x27;s exemplary but expensive for daily use. If I could afford to use the shave cream by itself, I would. It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Truefitt &amp; Hill shave cream in my shaving regimen for almost two years and I&#x27;m completely satisfied. The results are an extremely close shave with no nicks, cuts and very minimal razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;An outstanding product, highly recommended! Bravo!</li>
    <li> I started shaving with my Merkur Safety Razor a few years ago. Shortly afterwards I wanted to find a shaving cream to enhance to overall experience. While there are many different creams out there, and I&#x27;ve tried a few, I fell in love with this one.  It lathers up quite easily and has a bit of a lavender smell when applied, but after rinsing there is no scent. It has always provided me with the closest of shaves and is in my top five of &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; shaving creams. After you start using this type of shaving cream, you will never go back to canned shaving creams.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best shave cream on the market.  I have tried many but always come back to Truefitt &amp; Hill. You don&#x27;t need much and gives you such a smooth shave. You will thank me!</li>
    <li> Amazing shave cream. Great lather, hint of menthol. Will purchase again. Just a very small dab builds sufficient lather for 3 passes. You cannot go wrong with Truefitt &amp; Hill!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  It makes an immediate and very noticeable difference in smoothness and in closeness - you can get much closer much more easily and more comfortably.  I alternate using it with a more prosaic and lots cheaper similar item, and wish that I could feel like I could afford to use this right along.  Very good stuff - highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product twice through Amazon and both times have received the Aftershave Balm rather than the Shaving Creme.  The last time the external zip lock bag it came in actually said &amp;#34;Shaving Creme Travel Tube, 3.5 oz.,&amp;#34; but the product was the Aftershave Balm once more.  I will say that Amazon&#x27;s customer service is excellent and both times refunded my money with no issues whatsoever, but something is wrong between the ordering and fulfillment process.  Perhaps the company could afford to charge less than $33 for the product if they managed to find a way to actually deliver what the customer orders.</li>
    <li> Leathers up very good, the razors just glides on my skin, fragrance free, just what I expected from these guys, a great shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Particularly well suited for a soft silver tip badger brush.  Has a light fragrance that dissipates right after use, which is a positive for me.  I have tried shaving creams and soaps.  This is the one I prefer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it could get any better than this.  I tried the Taylor of Bond Sensitive Skin too.  This laters easier.  Somehow it seems to lather some on its own during my first pass.  Really impressive.  Sames time.  More consistent lathers that with taylor of bond (and I have in Missouri where the water is VERY hard).    It&#x27;s worth the cost difference over the Taylor of Bond Sensitive Skin shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Great product that i have been using for years. Unfortunately  this bottle was old or something as it smelled terribly of mildew when wet. I have returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> An amazing, luxurious shave cream! I used this with and without a brush and got a comfortable, close shave with each method. I used it with a regular cartridge razor (Gillette Pro Glide) and still got a great shave. A little goes a LONG way, especially when using a brush so this tube will last a long time. I use it exclusively when traveling because of the convenience of the small tube. It is hard to find such a quality shave cream in a travel size tube. Also this is unscented, so its great with your favorite scented after shave/cologne.</li>
    <li> I normally use proraso but have heard good reviews of the Truefitt &amp; Hill. I decided to give this a try and except for the higher price, this stuff is great. Very smooth shave and perfect lubricity.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with wet shaving, and I&#x27;ve only tried a couple of shaving creams, but I am generally happy with this product.  My wife is quite sensitive to strong scents, which is why I was looking for an unscented cream.  However, it does have a slight lavender scent, but it tends to dissipate in a short time and doesn&#x27;t cause her problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it is difficult to add just the right amount of water for the perfect lather, but I suppose that is the case with most shaving creams.  The biggest downside of this T&amp;H product is the high cost.  It&#x27;s cheaper to buy in the larger size tub, but that takes more shelf space in my bathroom and isn&#x27;t available on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a shaving cream when I travel.  However, the size of it (large) makes it impractical for travel purposes.  Nevertheless, this cream in my opinion is the best shaving cream on the market.  High quality.  Just a small amount placed in a mug, scuttle, or bowl - on on your face or brush if you fave lather - and you will get an excellent lather.  This is a product that is great for sensitive skin and I have used it as on of my shaving creams for more than five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are a fan of Uberlather as I am (soap + cream + a few drops of liquid glycerin) this product as the cream in the formula produces fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the product five stars as a home product but only four stars because the size is so large it takes up too much room when you travel and exceeds the size permitted in carry on baggage.</li>
    <li> With a dime-sized dollop, this shave cream quickly builds up a thick, rich lather in a cup and provides a smooth and well lubricated shave.  I have yet to find a shave cream that produces such a thick and luxurious lather so quickly.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is good shaving cream I use with a brush to lather in the palm of my hand before applying to my face.  It works well and lasts quite awhile.  I purchased my last tube seven months ago.</li>
    <li> This will last me forever!  I shave in the shower and with a dab of the cream on a brush I get a terrific shave. It really just tabs a dab and I have enough lather to shave twice.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaving cream.  He finds it  very hydrating and the lack of a scent is good for him. I wish it was less expensive.</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel amazing.  Even when I&#x27;m traveling and only use my electric shaver instead of my nice brush and safety razor.  But it ain&#x27;t cheap!  I usually mix mine about 50/50 with Nivia&#x27;s unscented aftershave balm for sensitive skin.  That way one tube lasts about a year.</li>
