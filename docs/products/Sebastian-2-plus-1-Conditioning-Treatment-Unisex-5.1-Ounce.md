      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found the item because it has been discontinued by the company.</li>
      <li>My hair love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This one combines the right amount of moisture and protein to keep a healthy balance in your hair that helps prevents breakage.  </li>
      <li>Glad to find this old favorite</li>
      <li>Ok so I really like this product, but its not the original 2 plus 1 Sabastian conditioner I was looking for.</li>

      <li>and I really like how easy this product is.</li>

      <li>Just have to say that my daily conditioner is better than using this one.</li>

      <li>After using Loreal Preference my hair was REALLY dry and NOTHING was getting it to lose that puffy and scraggly look that I have mostly managed to avoid.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice now and really like it.</li>
      <li>When hair breaks it has too much moisture or too much protein.  </li>
      <li>I used this and stop using so much heat in my hair</li>
      <li>Adds so much moisture.and makes hair very soft.</li>
      <li>but I still dye it when the premature white comes through too much.</li>
      <li>it makes hair soft and silky.</li>
      <li>Product looked opened and old.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if they sold me a fake one or if the real is really not at all good?</li>
      <li>I received this and the seam on the botttom was split like it had been opened and a different product was put in, because it doesn&#x27;t make my dry hair soft at all.</li>

    <li> very good conditioner I used by many time. this condition and smell good i &#x27;m happy with this purchase very good seller.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time !!!! Love it</li>
    <li> No change in my hair, I have dry course hair....this did nothing for me</li>
    <li> I have chest length curly European hair which is chemical (relaxed)  and colour treated. I try to do both services as little as possible which is why it has grown so long but I still dye it when the premature white comes through too much. After using Loreal Preference my hair was REALLY dry and NOTHING was getting it to lose that puffy and scraggly look that I have mostly managed to avoid. (Loreal excellence never does that and that is what I usually use). This conditioned my hair successfully and literally transformed it without stripping the colour at all.  I used almost the entire tube but the next time around only needed half. I have a lot of hair! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> Great hair product. When used, the hair does not fall out or anything. Great conditioner to use twice a week.</li>
    <li> Ok so I really like this product, but its not the original 2 plus 1 Sabastian conditioner I was looking for. I was looking for the much larger bottle ( thicker conditioner) apparently  its been discontinued, but this is a great substitute.</li>
    <li> it is good but for me it is not the original formula</li>

    <li> I know the brand and for me it is a very good one, I read several reviews saying how good this treatment is and bought it. What a waste of money! My friend actually told me to buy it because she has one and she loves it. I don&#x27;t know if they sold me a fake one or if the real is really not at all good? Just have to say that my daily conditioner is better than using this one. Didn&#x27;t return it because it would be another waste of money but I don&#x27;t intend to ever buy it again.</li>
    <li> It was definitely what I expected! I&#x27;m really glad I found the item because it has been discontinued by the company.</li>
    <li> I take my 2 plus 1 to the salon with me and I have my hair stylist use this instead of the salon product. My hair is very healthy, manageable, and soft thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> Great product..can&#x27;t wait to order and great price..!!.work wonders for my dry an frzzy hair. Adds so much moisture.and makes hair very soft.</li>
    <li> This item complies with condicones Information. In terms of price and quality is acceptable. I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Sebastian products are excellent.  This one combines the right amount of moisture and protein to keep a healthy balance in your hair that helps prevents breakage.  When hair breaks it has too much moisture or too much protein.  With this product you don&#x27;t have to try to figure out what your hair needs.</li>
    <li> The results are amazing! Glad to find this old favorite it makes hair soft and silky. Sebastian needs to bring this one back</li>
    <li> Product looked opened and old.  I didn&#x27;t dare to use it in my hair. I should have purchase it at a hair salon.</li>
    <li> My hair love this stuff. First off my beautician recommended this product to me because my hair was breaking badly because I always use the same conditioner. She said that I should switch conditioner every two weeks so my hair wouldn&#x27;t get to use to the conditioner. I used this and stop using so much heat in my hair and I have notice a big difference in the texture of my hair. It is more soft and silky. My hair have ways to go but I know this will help it get back to where it need to be.</li>
