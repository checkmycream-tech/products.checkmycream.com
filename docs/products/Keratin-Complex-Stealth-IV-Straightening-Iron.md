<li> Purchase this flat iron you will not be sorry!</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>

    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned and at an exceptional price.</li>
    <li> wires constantly break off the circuit board, have repaired it 3 times so far.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used chi the past 12 years or so, but the keratin complex is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve never gotten my hair so straight and in a shorter amount of time. And the best part is, my hair didn&#x27;t get frizzy throughout the day! My hair always frizzes as soon as I walk out the door, but not anymore!!! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Purchase this flat iron you will not be sorry! Went from 45 mins of straightening to 20 minutes and that was with very frizzy hair after being up in a bun.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I threw away my chi and I have the frizziest course hair ever!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Best Flat Iron ever. Love the temp gauge that tells you when it&#x27;s hot and I love that it&#x27;s durable. Sucker gets hot too. Burned my finger a few times already so be careful.</li>
    <li> This is my second Keratin Complex Stealth flat iron. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice for thick hair.  But it seems like if you don&#x27;t have a thick piece of hair, it won&#x27;t straighten it.  Gets hot fast and is digital.</li>
    <li> My hair was out of control kinky. A friend of mine had this iron and my hair LOVED it. Purchased one right then and there. Best thing that has happened to my hair. Since I started using it my hair has become silky smooth. The best part is that I don&#x27;t need a million hair products anymore. Thank You Stealth.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this iron!! so happy with it!!</li>
    <li> THE BEST Flatiron EVER!!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have natural thick wavy hair and have used a straightener since I was 17 (I&#x27;m 33 now) so I&#x27;ve been through a lot and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. It would only heat up to 410 degrees, even though the instructions say it should go to 450. She called the manufacturer who stated it should go to 450. It heats up and works ok, but the manufacturer said it is probably best to get another one because there may be a flaw with this one. Disappointing. Now we have to return and pay for the return shipping ourselves.</li>
    <li> love it! My last one lasted 6 years and hoping this one does too!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and evenly perfect for Keratin users</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve bought this like 15 years ago when I was younger and my hair started turning very thick and course. I could never straighen my hair like the pros did and thought it was due to my straightening skills and not my actual tool. For years I was using a $20 ceramic conair iron that left my hair fried and couldn&#x27;t fully get the job done. This straightener is a totally different animal. Leave my hair smooth, soft and shiny. You can use it on lightly damp hair for an even better effect. My hair doesnt get caught in the iron either. my stylist recommended this to me and it is one of the best investments I have ever made. Really life-changing, I&#x27;m serious...</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> My first Iron ever is a little clumsy to use. Perhaps a more streamlined handle would be an improvement. I have straight hair and use the iron to give each section of the crown some lift and volume. Then I curve the hair under as I reach the end of the each section of hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! It&#x27;s my second one. I had the first one for four years; worked like a dream. I dropped it on the floor last year twice, glued it back together and still works to this day. I gave it to my daughter and bought a new one for myself as a treat. :)</li>
