      <li>In only two sittings you can have the huge callous under control.</li>
      <li>This really works.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything from the Sephora diamond paddle to creams, scrubs, dr. scholl&#x27;s stuff and nothing really worked.  </li>
      <li>As a runner I have to admit the callus reducer comes in hand very well.</li>

      <li>The best on really bad feet.</li>
      <li>The handle is nice and thick and sturdy so you can apply pressure to your feet without it bending and the screen works the calluses down easily.  </li>
      <li>this product made my feet soft like a new born baby feet.</li>
      <li>The only other effective home use removal tool is the wet method with a razor blade.</li>
      <li>I had really cracked, dry, feet and this helped in one week to get my feet soft again.  </li>
      <li>Summer sandal season is hard on my feet and they seem to get callused so easily.  </li>
      <li>Its simple and easy to use and I also like the small jar of foot cream that it came with.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now that my feet are so soft I have been using regular lotion after my bath (I use the callus remover before my bath)</li>
      <li>the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use both for two weeks and my feet were soft.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s a small flexible screen, that gently shaves the callus off.  </li>
<li> The screens last a long time.</li>
<li> Make sure you put a paper towel under your foot because the scraping leaves behind a mess, which is what you want.</li>
<li> I have heavy callus&#x27; and I an always searching for something to use between pedicures, this is kind of weird</li>
<li> Before your eyes you will see soft shavings of dead skin flaking off.</li>
<li> This set has preformed miracles on my dry heels and feet.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin.</li>
<li> I also paid $18.00 for it (it has a few replacement screens), so I was surprised to find it here for much less.</li>
<li> Only a couple little spots that I am still working on.  </li>
<li> and I no longer have ANY rough patches of skin on my feet.</li>
<li> Never use on wet skin.  </li>
<li> I have tried a lot of other prodcuts for my feet and nothing ever worked as well as Sof Feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have had trouble with cracked heels when traveling to a dry climate.</li>
<li> My feet aren&#x27;t in bad shape, but something comes up, tis will quickly smooth it out without discomfort.</li>
<li> I have horrible calluses on my feet that crack and haven&#x27;t found anything that works really well (unless I soak my feet for awhile first to soften them up).  </li>
<li> This is my little miracle for my feet.  </li>
<li> The cream that comes with the file is HEAVY</li>
<li> I have use the Pedi Egg and scratched so hard I&#x27;ve torn my flesh.  </li>
<li> If you have hard calluses you need this callus reducer.  </li>
<li> So I hate to give it a bad review, because I can see how it would really help people who don&#x27;t have feet as bad as mine.</li>
<li> You will want the handle and appreciate it&#x27;s simplistic yet functional design.</li>
<li> I have horrible cracked, dry feet that are often painful in the winter.</li>
<li> I think it all depends on how bad your feet are.</li>
<li> It can become very painful, making walking difficult.</li>

    <li> AS I read the reviews I wondered if this was too good to be true.  Not........this is a wonderful product and does exactly what it promises.  The best on really bad feet.</li>
    <li> I think it all depends on how bad your feet are. I have horrible cracked, dry feet that are often painful in the winter. I have&lt;br /&gt;tried many creams, pumice stones and soaks with no improvement. This device removed a good amount of the surface dry skin, but I still have a lot of callous to deal with. So I hate to give it a bad review, because I can see how it would really help people who don&#x27;t have feet as bad as mine.</li>
    <li> Everyonce in awhile you find a product that does exactly what it says it will. This is one of those products. Works easily and effectively for removing callouses and dry skin from the feet. So much better than pumice! I love it!</li>
    <li> Summer sandal season is hard on my feet and they seem to get callused so easily.  I have been using pumice stones to keep them looking nice.  When I saw this screen with a handle and read the great reviews I wanted to give it a try.  Now I am hooked, it works really well.

    <li> This is the 2nd one of these that I have ordered and I love it. It is the best thing that I have found to remove rough skin from your heels. The cream is wonderful too. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you have hard calluses you need this callus reducer.  Before your eyes you will see soft shavings of dead skin flaking off. It&#x27;s works so gently and effectively that you will need a towel to catch all the shavings.  I have use the Pedi Egg and scratched so hard I&#x27;ve torn my flesh.  This system is not anything like that.  It&#x27;s a small flexible screen, that gently shaves the callus off.  Never use on wet skin.  I am always barefooted and have feet calluses to prove it, now I use the Sof Feet Callus Remover at any sign of callus build up.&lt;br /&gt;This sounds like an ad as I read it over.... But it&#x27;s truly my story and my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product this morning at my local beauty supply store, based on the recommendation of the store clerk.  I have horrible calluses on my feet that crack and haven&#x27;t found anything that works really well (unless I soak my feet for awhile first to soften them up).  I just used this tool and it works amazingly well.  I also paid $18.00 for it (it has a few replacement screens), so I was surprised to find it here for much less.</li>
    <li> This really works. Better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. As a runner I have to admit the callus reducer comes in hand very well.</li>
    <li> This foot file keeps my feet super smooth!!  I can keep my own heels callous free and save a lot of money on pedis!!  The cream that comes with the file is HEAVY so I use it occasionally.  The cream is just an added bonus, the file is what really does the trick!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I wish I found this before I purchase a battery operated one. Its simple and easy to use and I also like the small jar of foot cream that it came with. I will be buying the bigger size of that.</li>
    <li> I have heavy callus&#x27; and I an always searching for something to use between pedicures, this is kind of weird but it works.  Make sure you put a paper towel under your foot because the scraping leaves behind a mess, which is what you want.</li>
    <li> This is quite the best tool I have ever used for dry feet and callouses.  I have tried everything from the Sephora diamond paddle to creams, scrubs, dr. scholl&#x27;s stuff and nothing really worked.  This is my little miracle for my feet.  The cream that comes with it is okay.  But the tool is AMAZING and it will not let you down!  I now have the softest feet possible.</li>
    <li> This works very well to remove dead skin from heels.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  I would recommend this to anyone with cracks and callouses on their feet.</li>
    <li> After trying many products, only this got our satisfaction; it works great, comfortable and easy to use. I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. I have had trouble with cracked heels when traveling to a dry climate. It can become very painful, making walking difficult. This set has preformed miracles on my dry heels and feet.</li>
    <li> I had really cracked, dry, feet and this helped in one week to get my feet soft again.  The Callus Reducer tool by itself is the best one I ever used and it lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve had it for weeks now and haven&#x27;t had to change it yet.  After putting on the cream I noticed a difference the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use both for two weeks and my feet were soft.  Only a couple little spots that I am still working on.  I have tried a lot of other prodcuts for my feet and nothing ever worked as well as Sof Feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my feet are so soft I have been using regular lotion after my bath (I use the callus remover before my bath) and I am so happy I decided to give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, not rough like other callus removers. Very Effective! I do road runs and my feet always get rough/hard points on certain areas. This product leaves the bottom of my feet smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best callous removers for dry removal I have ever used. The screens last a long time. The only other effective home use removal tool is the wet method with a razor blade.</li>
    <li> This thing IS AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy files, rocks, etc. If you are a man with big boot callouses, get this. It is a drywall sanding sheet piece that attaches to a well designed handle. You will want the handle and appreciate it&#x27;s simplistic yet functional design. In only two sittings you can have the huge callous under control. It turns it into pain free fine dust.</li>
    <li> Love this product !! Will not be without !!! Easy to use and actually works !!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this out !</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to reduce calluses. I use it once a week and I no longer have ANY rough patches of skin on my feet. I&#x27;ve never written a review of anything I&#x27;ve purchased before but this little tool is so good, I just has to write one!</li>
    <li> This is the best callius scraper I have ever used and I have used lots of different one. This one gets the job done fast I use about once a week to keep my feet in good shape.</li>
    <li> This is the best callas reducer I ever used at home or in a salon.  It removes stubborn callas like I&#x27;ve never seen.</li>
    <li> best thing i have ever tried. this product made my feet soft like a new born baby feet. i would recommend this product to people who have crusty feet.</li>
    <li> This is the best callus remover that I have ever used and I have tried most of them.  It really did the job.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> seems to do the job. My feet aren&#x27;t in bad shape, but something comes up, tis will quickly smooth it out without discomfort. Haven&#x27;t tried the foot cream it comes with.</li>
    <li> I saw a video of this on YouTube and decided to try it!  I walk a lot and always trying to find something to help my feet.  This is definitely a winner;  the callus reducer and cream are both fabulous!</li>
