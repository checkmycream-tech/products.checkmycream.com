<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great oil and great price just what i was looking for and at a great price  I will order again</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample a few months ago right after I had bleached my hair &amp; this stuff is a lifesaver.  If you color or dye your hair often I would highly recommend it for keeping your hair super soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> i use it after every time i wash my hair. it makes it so smooth and soft with shine. i have frizzy hair and it helps so so so much.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Smells wonderful and makes my hair soft and smooth. Key is to put it on partially dry hair.</li>
    <li> My hair was very dry. I purchases this product thinking it would make my hair healthier.  Although it made my hair super soft and pretty,  the benefits would disappear each time I washed my hair. Now that I&#x27;ve switched to a better shampoo and conditioner combo, my hair is feeling way healthier.  The soy renewal is still an awesome product.  It just isn&#x27;t a permanent fix. I love using it to control static in the winter.</li>
    <li> I received this product in my Ipsy bag to try out and I just knew I needed more!  I loved it.  It leaves my hair looking healthy, shiny and alive!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s my second bottle. It absorbs into the hair (and my skin) instead of just laying on top. I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how soft and healthy my hair looks even though I blow dry it almost every day. This stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> This is terrific stuff.  I have fine hair, but lots of it, and live in Arizona.  The dry heat here is very harsh on my hair.  This product actually leaves it smooth and silky without weighing it down.  This has become my #1 favorite hair care product of all times.  A very small amount goes a long way - a nickel size amount works for me.</li>
    <li> Nourishing but not greasy.  There is a smell to it but it is not an obnoxious perfume like so many hair products these days.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product on Amazon! You do not get what they are advertising! I have bought this from salons for years and absolutely love it, but this product is different. The container is teal with a pink wrapper around it with a black lid, while the ones from salons have teal containers with the writing directly on the container, no wrapper, and a brown lid. The product itself smells different and is thinner than when I&#x27;ve bought it in salons.</li>
    <li> I use this religiously and have for several years.  It makes my hair very soft and manageable without feeling greasy.  I really like it, but I think the formula may have changed and it&#x27;s not quite as good as it used to be (which is why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars).  Still, I don&#x27;t go a day without it.  (Hint:  Any residue left on my hands after applying it to my hair gets rubbed on my elbows which tend to get very dry.)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product ! No split ends in months!</li>
    <li> My hair looks so Shiny and healthy! #blackhair!</li>
    <li> I ordered this about a week ago, got free shipping, and only paid $9.00 for it! That was a good deal if ever I saw one. Anyway, I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but it&#x27;s absolutely fabulous so far! I was afraid when I saw the consistency of it that it would weigh my hair down and make it greasy, but it somehow does the complete opposite. Yesterday I put it in my hair after washing and towel drying it and just let it air dry. Normally my (straight, thick, blonde) hair gets fairly frizzy when I let it air dry. Not anymore! It is shiny and bouncy and smooth and lovely, even after sleeping on it. It&#x27;s also rainy outside, and that&#x27;s not usually an advantage when it comes to hair. It&#x27;s not phasing mine, though!</li>
    <li> I love this healthy sexy hair soy renewal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy this all the time my hair demands it easy  comb and soft I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. One of the best hair products out there! It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and leave your locks looking sleek, revitalized and rejuvenated. I have to have a bottle on had all the time. Must have product!</li>
    <li> I put this in my damp hair after every shower. You don&#x27;t need much, only a small amount. Rub in hands, run through hair, then brush. Works wonders.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I have an obsession with anything that is great-smelling. We get together for \\&quot;Show and Smell\\&quot; and share our booty.&lt;br /&gt;  Little did I know the night she shared this little dynamo of a product it would actually increase my happy-factor exponentially.&lt;br /&gt;  I *love* good-smelling hair.  And this Soy Renewal delivers.  I get compliments all the time- even a bite on the neck!  YES! ;D&lt;br /&gt;  But I also have very fine hair that I process (hi-&amp; low-lights) which tends to be frizzy in the Summer- Not a happy thing.&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product, it makes an immediate difference.  My hair is softer, shinier, swingier, (yeah, it&#x27;s a word)&lt;br /&gt;and smoother.  What other S-words can I use?&lt;br /&gt; And as anyone with fine hair knows, hair-shine products can really weigh down hair &amp; make it look like you&#x27;ve been swimming in an oil spill but that&#x27;s not the case with this product.  Of course, go verrry sparingly on the scalp area, if at all..but that&#x27;s quite the accomplishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs &amp; all my happy, sexy follicles Up!  (figuratively.)&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
    <li> Makes hair soft, smooth and feels amazing!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this oil!! The smell is amazing, almost like a cologne and it leaves your hair shiny and healthy! Even if you have mousse on and don&#x27;t want that hard feeling you put this and instantly feel your hair softer! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this a while before showering leaves my hair feeling great</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a kid, my hair has had awful breakage in the back. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now and Ive seen a wonderful improvement with the breakage. My hair dresser recommended this and I&#x27;m so happy that she did. The price seems high, but it lasts awhile. I have found that amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist.  This is the best out of the types of syrum available.  Chi, Redken, Bed Head, etc...  NOBODY has a better finishing syrum than this.  BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> Healthy for your hair and controls the frizz.  I use it every time now and don&#x27;t like to be without it.  Makes my hair shinny and smooth but not greasy.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT - a little goes a long way whether your hair is long or short, male or female. Smells good, leaves hair shiny, easy to style.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine curls, and this stuff is awesome for my hair. Keeps the curls nice and soft&lt;br /&gt;and moisturized. I love it, my new holy grail.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this stuff works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon then Walmart. I prefer to shop at Amazon exclusively.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd bottle of this product I&#x27;ve gotten for myself.  The first bottle lasted me over a year (I have long hair, and my 3 daughters, who also have long hair, also used it about a couple times a week)  I also bought a bottle for my sis-in-law, who now swears by it.  I use about a dime size amount, (I have dark hair, which is thin, but there&#x27;s a lot of it.  I have to be careful about putting too much product at the crown so it doesn&#x27;t get weighed down) which makes drying much faster and it seemed to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; the damage at my ends and make my hair super soft.  My oldest daughter (age 11), who has blond, hard-to-control, very thick hair, several inches below her waist (we&#x27;ve cut it about 30 inches, but it grows so fast), needs about 4 times as much as I do, but it transforms it.  When we use this oil, her hair is tamed and manageable.  If we use this oil AND straighten it, she has strangers stop and comment every time.  I haven&#x27;t found another product this amazing for hair...possibly ever.</li>
    <li> Product received packaged and protected very well! I love this product as it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily, smells nice, and helps your hair become beautiful! It was recommended by my hair stylist - but I have been paying over double the price at the salon! I will be purchasing from this site in the future! Very excited!</li>
    <li> This product is magic! LOVE it! My stylist tried to sell it to me for a lot more money in the salon. This price is way better here. I will buy this product for a million years if the price stays low.</li>
    <li> Works well, very happy!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product at my local hair salon so I was delighted to find it here for a fraction of the price.  It helps to make my gray hairs less wirey.</li>
    <li> Half of product poured out due to loose closure on cap. Too expensive to waste at no fault of mine. this is the second time this has happened.</li>
    <li> I love it, it makes my hair very natural</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair sleek, soft and smooth.  I also love the smell and it helps my hair dry faster too.</li>
    <li> I subscribe to Ipsy and got this in my bag one month.  I loved it and had to have more.  I have very long, thick hair and this really helps keep it soft and frizz free.  Amazon had the best prices and shipping was really fast.</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world for dry or permed hair! Worth every penny!  Lasts at least six month of everyday use</li>
    <li> I have long hair and it takes forever to blow dry it after I shampoo.  I put this on after I towel dry my hair, its cut my blowing drying time in half.  I put it on again after I have dryed my hair.  It doesnt build up and gets rids of that dry flyaway hair.  Makes your hair shine and feels stronger.  I like all thier products.</li>
    <li> Amazing good product, if you have hard to dry hair......this helps amazingly!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Just a little goes a long way! Makes my hair so smooth and frizz-free!</li>
    <li> Bought this on my stylist&#x27;s recommendation and not sure how I ever managed to have good-looking hair without it! Doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy and my bangs cooperate sooo much better!</li>
    <li> I combine this with Straight Sexy Hair Darn Straight Polishing Lotion.  Leaves hair soft and shiny.  Pleased with this product.  I have short hair, heavily textured with highlights.  I blow dry my hair and use a straightening iron.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy on your hair. I also love how it smells. This product leaves my hair feeling soft and looking shiny. The only downside to this product is the price. I wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> First of all, when I got this product it came in a red colored bottle, not blue, like the picture. This product doesn&#x27;t work as well as it says it does. When my stylist used it on me at the salon, the texture was thicker than the product in the bottle that I have. I don&#x27;t know if this is the product that I ordered. It says that it is on the bottle, but the texture of it makes me think that it isn&#x27;t. When my stylist used this product on me at the salon it worked wonders. When I use this, it doesn&#x27;t do everything that the bottle says it should. After I use it, I still have fly aways and my hair is still full of static. It doesn&#x27;t get moisturized.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 bottles - seal was broken on both. One bottle was half empty. Oil was a different color than previously purchased bottles @ different locations. Will not order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair is fine and thin and it just does wonders on it. Takes care of the frizz and adds body to my hair. I love the fact that you can use it on damp or dry hair.  I had a small sample bottle and was so happy to be able to get a big bottle at such a good price.</li>
    <li> I use this daily because it softens, protects, and shines my hair without making it oily or greasy. And it smells really nice! The best part about this is that it keeps my hair from frizzing. The price for this particular product from this seller is excellent - to buy this in-store is $22+ so to get it for $12 here is fantastic! Also, it shipped fast and was well-protected so it was not damaged during shipping.</li>
    <li> Helps my tangled hair stay smooth and dry more quickly.</li>
    <li> Th I s makes your hair so soft and not greasy.  You only need a little and it lasts for a very long time.  Will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves my hair feeling super smooth and shiny! I have really thick, long hair and after I got a sample in my ipsy bag I thought I would give it a try. After a few days I noticed a big difference in the way my hair felt. I straighten my hair almost everyday and it tends to get frizzy sometimes, but once I put this in my hair, frizziness is gone!this bottle will definitely last me all year, and I will definitely purchase another bottle once I&#x27;m done with this one. Thanks ipsy!!</li>
    <li> No problems with shipment, very happy customer. Please never discontinue this product, I have tried many others and non work the same. I am a Latina with thick corse, frizzy, wavy and at times curly hair.</li>
    <li> second time ordering it , it works great for dry hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff really works and is affordable! I would also recommend the beach spray from the same brand</li>
    <li> Just another product havent noticed any difference in my hair</li>
    <li> I love this product it was so fast to blow dry my hair today. Took away frizz! hands down best hair product!! would buy it again</li>
    <li> I color my hair and even with shampoo and conditioner it still can be dry. Use a tiny amount and I have no dry hair issues.</li>
    <li> Love how my hair looks when using this product! I don&#x27;t use anything else now.  I finally found something that turns my frizzy hair into curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product will cut your blowdrying time in half if not more!! It leaves hair soft, silky and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT! totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> I first bought this at a salon. This product is the same thing for significantly less money! It makes my hair shine and feel so healthy.</li>
    <li> Arrived very time and just as expected. I love this product and am so happy I can save money buying online vs in the salon.</li>
    <li> Love this item!!! Have and will buy it again!!! cant find a better product to make my hair healthy &amp; shiny!!</li>
    <li> my salon lady is always trying to get me to switch to redken but i REFUSE. my hair has grown SO much in the last year.. and she compliments my hair everytime and says its a combination of cuts often and what i do at home (wash 2 a week.. blow dry and straighten each wash and thats it.) i put this in after the shower when my hair has been in a towel for a lil while so its still damp.. brush through with a wide tooth comb. i always will use a lil on the ends if they are feeling dry because of the weather or something. this is the most amazing hair oil EVER. refken diamond oil doesnt even come close to comparing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry hair. My hair is like hay from over-processing-- this product adds life back into my hair. It&#x27;s also great as a detangler and for adding shine.</li>
    <li> Received this product in an entirely different package  it was pink and as you can see this product is in a green/teal bottle. Hopefully this is the same product that I had from an ultra sample. I have used the sample on my dry hair in the evening prior to bed.. My hair is in much better condition</li>
    <li> I just love this product...and its awesome....and shipping was also before time... U should try it and m damm sure u will like it...</li>
    <li> Received a free sample from Ulta Beauty and tried it the other day with absolutely amazing results! I live in a very dry climate and have long, super-fine hair that dries out despite conditioning my hair every other day. I am definitely ordering this through amazon (much cheaper), and will make this my go to hair product.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!! Keeps my hair soft and looking healthy. I use it, because I dye my hair about every 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll cosign other reviews- this product is a LIFESAVER..errr, hairsaver. It&#x27;s done wonders for my hair, which is a bit on the thin side and that I use heat products on regularly. I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my hairs shine and strength, and it does a great job of maintaining frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that continuously frustrates me is the bottle&#x27;s design. It is horrendous for travel and when you&#x27;re running low- if the bottle tips over (while closed, obviously) it still leaks like nobody&#x27;s business and I&#x27;ve lost a lot of the product because of this. Healthy Sexy Hair needs to tweak the design of the bottle to make it airtight when snapped close to make it easy to travel or turn upside down- for such an expensive product, it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating to lose so much when travelling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you do take it with you to travel, make sure to put it in a ziploc bag!</li>
    <li> My wife like bed this stuff!  Lasts a lonnngg time!</li>
    <li> Just when I thought I was going to have to shave my head due to my hair being so damaged, this was the last product I was hopeful about trying... I would totally recommend it to anybody who has damaged n broken hair!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have fine hair with some body and It left hair feeling soft and shiny without weighing it down. Has a very nice smell. All you need is a little and will last you a long time. I use after shampooing and before drying and styling. If I want a little extra shine I&#x27;ll use a little after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Favorite Hair Product! Smells Great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have color treated hair and it helps my hair to look healthy and makes it more manageable</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this product where I usually have my hair cut. After running out I decided to check amazon&#x27;s price and it was more that half off. A true savings.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. I&#x27;ve used it for a very long time. It really helps with tangles on wet hair. My hair is super long so getting it combed out after a shower would be impossible without this stuff and makes your hair really soft when dry.</li>
    <li> I tried this in one of my Ipsy Glam Bags and fell in love instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great hair product for a great price... I have really thick curly hair... putting this in it after the Soy Renewal Leave in Conditioner really helps cut drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and my ends look really good... after all the dye and heat!</li>
    <li> Use this all the time.  It feels really good in your hair and makes your hair less dry.</li>
    <li> Finally, my hair is moisturized and silky enough to wear down!  I was cursed to a constant ponytail or bun in the past...but no longer.  :)  Will never go without.</li>
    <li> My hair was fried off by a stylist and I have used this religiously for years now and it is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I put a little in while my hair is wet to blow dry it and a little on the ends after its dry to style it. it smells awesome too</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go a day with out it!  I get soooooo many compliments on my hair now!  Everyone has asked me what am I doing different and I tell them about this.  I have long hair sonI only use it on the bottom four inches so I can still get height and volume.  Great buy!!</li>
    <li> If you looking for a product to cut the drying time, make ur hair smooth, shiny and just beautiful. This is it. I put it in my hair after showering and just leave it or you can style it. Results are pretty amazing. Also noticed my hair doesn&#x27;t get as greasy. Which is a plus. They have sample sizes if your doubtful. Good stuff. Haven&#x27;t tried the rest of the line.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best hair oil around. I tend to have dry hair and I flat iron it and this product really helps protect my hair and leaves it super soft. The product also has an appealing smell. Definelty recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m with everyone else here! This stuff is amazing! I use it on my hair and my daughter (6 yrs) and it keeps our hair soft and free of tangles. I paid $25 for it at salon and I am thrilled to find it a lot cheaper here. It&#x27;s a little bottle but it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use too much!  A little of this goes a long way.  This is a great product, I have mid-back length, very curly, thick, course hair that tangles easily.  Just a quarter size in my palm &amp; rubbed between hands, then through the hair makes the comb glide through!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m glad i found this for a less expensive price. this way i bought two of them instead of 1.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair. Gives my weird semi straight/semi curly hair curl, or helps keep my hair straight of I decide to straighten It.</li>
    <li> I love this hair oil!!! A little goes a long way. I have just below the shoulder length hair and only have to use about a nickel size for my whole head. I have found this at many other stores but never for such a good price. I was able to buy two bottles for the price of one.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair, I use it 3 -4 times per week, my hair can be naturally oily so more frequent use doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
    <li> Gives you total softness and strength like you&#x27;ve never had. I would definitely recommend this for any and all hair types. A little goes a longggg way with this product do the bottle will last u a long time! :)</li>
    <li> Perfect consistency...wasn&#x27;t too heavy or too light. Hydrates well and smells great! Definitely my new favorite hair product. Can&#x27;t wait to try the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday!! It does not make my hair oily or anything! One of the best products I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and it really takes out the frizz without weighing my hair down with an oily looking film.</li>
    <li> This speeds up the drying process like crazy. Good for anyone, but if you have curly hair and like to blow it out straight rather than use a flat iron, this stuff is amazing. Run a bunch through damp hair and have at it, you&#x27;ll spend half the time on the dry.</li>
    <li> So far I like it, but it has done nothing to tame frizz in my curly hair, that being said curly hair can take longer to respond to a new hair product just because it is curly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue use this bottle and see how my hair responds over time.&lt;br /&gt;Just a&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip for the the curly heads out there that my beloved Grandmother taught me~~~&lt;br /&gt;after washing and conditioning rinse your curly locks with very cold water, this closes the cells give it shine and helps with the frizz.</li>
    <li> This product is great to keep curly hair from frizzing.  It is also great for giving a sleek blowout look.</li>
    <li> I have recently used this, it leaves my hair oily! It isn&#x27;t good for my hair either. Weighs it down so badly too. I put it in the soy and cocoa shampoo thinking it would look better, as time went on my hair got oilier, and greasy looking. It was even that way when I first used it, I also used the pumpkin set the masque and the conditioner. Maybe I just condition it too much, but, regardless my hair looks limp and lifeless.</li>
    <li> Sexy Hair has really outdone itself with the product Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal by combining the benefits of soy and argan oil with a uniquely divine and lasting sent. The soy oil helps nourish hair to increase its elasticity and strength while moisturizing it.Considering that it contains argan oil, the \\&quot;liquid gold\\&quot; of beauty products, this hair treatment goes beyond strengthening weak, split-end hair by giving it shine and locking in moisture for the whole day. This serum also helps control frizz and flyaways without leaving your hair all greasy and damp. To top it off, this product has a signature fragrance that smells like the sweet spring time roses mixed with hints of tropical coconut. I personally use this product because I have been dying my hair for six years which has caused it to become dull, dead, crunchy and just unhealthy until I discovered this product. After using this product, my hair had become smooth, shiny, silky, and fragrant. Overall this product is made of quality ingredients that will help transform unhealthy dry hair into a silky smooth locks, however there are some faults to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Though the bottle design itself is eye catching and unique, some of them do not hold in the product very well. There is a design flaw in some of the brown caps that allows oil to slowly seep out only when it falls on its side so a considerable amount of the product ends up on the table instead of hair. The only other downfall to this product is its price tag. In stores, it runs for about twenty-one dollars just for one 4.2 fluid ounce bottle and even though Amazon has the same bottle for around ten dollars, it is still a pricey product. Regardless of these faults, the product speaks for itself when compared to got2b Argan Oil. Unlike soy renewal, got2b Argan Oil leaves hair greasy and oily causing it to quickly dry out and form split-ends. Even on Amazon, Soy renewal has a 4.75 out of 5 star rating with 72% giving it five stars where got2b Argan Oil on has a rating of 3.5 out of 5 with 42% giving it five stars. These customer reviews show that between the two products, Soy Renewal is the favorite compared to got2b Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy Hair Soy Renewal is a fragranced serum that utilizes the benefits of soy and argan oil to strengthen and moisturize hair while making it shiny and smooth without the greasy residue. However, some of the brown caps may be defective and cause some of the serum to be lost. Also the price tag may be costly depending on if you buying it from a store or online. Even though got2b argan oil is the cheaper product, it leaves hair oily and dry compared to the silky smooth results of Soy Renewal. Overall, this product fixes most of the damage in hair caused by daily styling and it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It has calmed fly away hair without weighing it down. I love the results.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it makes soft and shiny without weighing it down. I use it every day with no build up. Makes my lightened hair look healthy. I&#x27;m planning on trying the entire line. Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite product! My friend used it on my hair and I just had to get some for myself. Smells great and leave my hair shiny and soft not oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! However, this is the second time i&#x27;ve ordered it, and both times the bottle has leaked! I just transfer it to another bottle, but it&#x27;s a hastle. If they fix that I would give it 5/5!</li>
    <li> I first found this from my beautician. The smell is to die for and the oil easy on the hair and scalp. Loved it so much I scoured the net to find more!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;ll make your hair feel so soft and silky. Your hair will absorb it like a sponge. NOT greasy at all.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this product!!!</li>
    <li> fast delivery,,,love the product</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt as healthy as it has since I&#x27;ve been using this oil. It also speeds up the drying time of my hair significantly. It&#x27;s honestly amazing- it makes my hair look better, feel better, and smell better. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out my hair and this stuff is a great product to use while doing so. I gave it to my mom to try too and she also fell in love with it! I have thick, long hair and she has short, thin hair. It works fabulously on all hair types! I will be repurchasing this many times in the future (though the bottle lasts so long it will surely take a long time for me to need to do so).</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Makes hair soft and shiny. I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry or brittle hair.</li>
    <li> fantastic oil for my thick long hair - doesn&#x27;t leave it oily but shiny and smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This hair serum smells nice, has a good consistency, and contains quality ingredients on par with more expensive products.  The first week I used it, it made my hair moisturized and shiny, and seemed to improve my hair health.  However, after a few weeks of use, the serum built up on my hair shaft and ended up making my hair dry and brittle.  I started to have a lot of hair breakage and shedding.  As with most hair serums, this one contains a lot of silicones, which can be an issue for some.  Once I stopped using it and clarified my hair, my hair breakage slowly diminished.  I still like the serum, but I would recommend that you use it occasionally...not everyday.</li>
    <li> i really like this product! i have semi curly hair and it can frizz this is the best stuff to keep your hair tame!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  You get a lot for your money and it smells WONDERFUL!  Also, it feels smooth and not greasy on my curly hair but works best when I put it on after straightening my hair.  I love the healthy sexy line!</li>
    <li> it makes my hair sooo silky smooth and one bottle lasts forever b/c you only need about a dime size amount (and that&#x27;s for my mid-back length hair)</li>
    <li> it leaves my hair oily..</li>
    <li> I paid full price for this at a salon (ouch) and I absolutely love it. I have medium length, thin, curly, color treated hair that I abuse on a regular basis. I prefer to use it (quarter sized amount) on wet hair before I blow dry and straighten. It gives it a great shine and cuts the frizz beautifully. When I let my hair curl, I use half the amount on wet hair and work from the ends up, same great results. I have stopped using all my other products, which was 3 to straighten, not including hair spray! I am very happy Amazon has it at HALF the salon price.&lt;br /&gt;It has made my hair MUCH more manageable and healthier. I just purchased the shampoo and conditioner with hopes of even better, healthier hair. We&#x27;ll see how that goes!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Compliments on how shiny my hair is.</li>
    <li> This is not a good choice, it is not oily, but it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. The bottle is leaking when use it, and the liquid will turn to sticky gel. Not recommend.</li>
    <li> This worked for me for a little while,  then it seemed to be making my hair worse.  I have very fine hair,  so I think that it may work better for others with a different hair type.  It goes on well with no grease leftover on my hair later, but I think the silicones just build up too easily on fine hair types.  My hair was a mess until I did a clarifying shampoo.</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot took a long time to come in the mail but it helps with blow drying and making hair look nice</li>
    <li> My hair is much smoother since starting to use this. I put some on prior to using heat straightener and it help to protect my hair from the heat. Just don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look greasy.</li>
    <li> I have thin, curly hair and it has a tendency to get dry and frizzy. I put a dime size amount into my wet hair and it stays soft and silky all day. Not greasy</li>
    <li> I do like this.  Makes hair soft and shiny and gives it life.  Does cost more than it should.  OK</li>
    <li> Great product  my hair feels &amp; looks renewed</li>
    <li> Love this product I always use this line of hair line, but this renewal treatment for hair is really good makes my hair feel great and it&#x27;s not sticky messy or weigh on the hair love it!</li>
    <li> I love the Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal, but what I received is not this product. I got something in pink packaging, contains a thin oil, rather than something thicker like I remember. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product does not weigh down my curls and makes my hair soft.  I recommend it for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Product was great for curly hair.  Kind of like a light gel effect.  Really dig the smell too!</li>
    <li> The product works well, maybe not as good as the expensive Moroccan Oil, but close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other comment is that the bottle does not travel well - the top is very loose and the flip lid easily comes open causing leaks even when you tighten it as much as possible. In the future, I&#x27;m going to transfer the product to a travel bottle.</li>
    <li> Got this because I used some of my brothers (which he got to soften his beard) on my hair and loved how it toned the frizz down, but didn&#x27;t make my hair look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you use a lot of heating products or swim consistently. Downside is the bottle leaks, so when traveling, get a different bottle or carry it around in a ziplock bag to protect your things.</li>
    <li> Smells so good!  I really liked this product, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down either.</li>
    <li> Gives hair wonderful shine and body. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I need oil for my hair is dry so I bought Soy Renewal.  It&#x27;s natural and it gives me the softness and the shine without leaving my hair greasy.  I recommend the product!</li>
    <li> Terrific oil that doesn&#x27;t weigh down or grease up my fine, tangly hair, but makes it easy to comb through wet and moist and healthy-looking all day. I use it on my son&#x27;s long hair, too, with great results. I wish a bottle lasted longer, though. I use about a dime-sized dollop daily, and I have to reorder about 3x/year.</li>
    <li> I use this with the conditioning spray, and then blow dry.  Leaves my hair silky smooth and I also like to use the straight and sexy hair smoothing spray when using flat iron, I highly recommending pairing this with COnditioner, spray conditioner, and smoother... I love the sexy line</li>
    <li> I love this product. It takes only a very small amount to make my hair look and feel healthier and shiner.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now and i love it .i have very long hair and it makes my hair so smooth and shiny...</li>
    <li> made a girls hair that was fried look really shiny after a hair cut. for me its not good n smells like Grandma I like the paul mitchel for sleek no frizz hair</li>
    <li> as advertised, fast delivery, good price.</li>
    <li> I love this product so I gave it 5 stars, and the company selling it is wonderful. But Amazon packages it in a way that makes it impossible to open without damaging the caps.  They had  tightly wrapped it with a weird sticky cellophane cover that i took me almost half an hour with scissors and a small knife to get it off without doing damage to the bottles. Then I went to use the first bottle, opened the lid, and tipped over the bottle to pour a little product on my hand, and the lid popped up, and product poured all over. I&#x27;ve bought this product in a salon before and not had any troubles.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was fabulous, and even refunded me my money, and said they would check with Amazon on the packaging. They took full responsibility! The seller gets 5 stars along with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this from a hair salon over a year ago and was surprised by how much I loved it. You can use it on wet or dry hair (I prefer dry). All you do is use a dime size amount and rub it into the ends of your hair and use your straightener.  It seems like it will be greasy but it&#x27;s really not. It makes your hair shine and it takes the frizz right out. It&#x27;s a great friend for your straightener.  I bought a bottle for my daughter and daughter in law and they love it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product when I purchase hairspray and fell in love.it is awesome makes hair shine,creates volume,and even speeds drying time.I was so happy to find it on amazon that I bought 2 and couldnt be happier.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very smooth and soft. A little goes a long ways!!</li>
    <li> I initially bought this product because of how amazing the smell was. It&#x27;s reminiscent of warm brown sugar, thats the only way I can describe its truly fantastic scent. Aside from that though, I have curly hair that I often straighten. When I go curly, I apply the serum while my hair is still wet to control frizz and keep my curls moisturized. When I straighten my hair I apply it dry and it seals the style in, makes my hair super soft, adds lots of shine and again helps a ton with frizz.</li>
    <li> Wonderful formula, especially for those with unruly, thick, and curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have NOT noticed a huge difference in my hair with this. I bought it because of the reviews and I still use it but over all not too impressed</li>
    <li> This is fabulous for my silver hair. It adds softness to my hair and I can style it with my fingers and not use a jell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I do not lose hair as I did.  This stuff keeps your hair healthy. It helped withdry hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is miracle in a bottle for my thin, dry hair!!! I use this at night and wash away in the morning. After a week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;I could brush my thin/dry hair while wet!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is so healthy and shiny and frizz-free when I use it! Definitely the best of similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this on my hair a couple of years ago and I have been using ever since.  Makes my hair feel healthy and strong. Recommend highly especially on colored hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Smart Style and paid $21.59 * tax!  ouch.  But I love it.  My hair (African American) is (Bleached and dyed) growing and the longer it gets, the more coarse and dry it gets. In the past I would cut it but this time I decided to try everything ------ and this product worked.  I use it religiously.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever gave this 1 Star is crazy.  I have used everything out there to put moisture in my hair and this works.</li>
    <li> This really helps my dry hair and is not greasy.  The only thing I do not like is that you cannot lay the bottle on its side in a drawer because it leaks even with cap on tightly.  Had also put it in my bathroom kit while travelling and it leaked through the kit and onto my clothes which did not make me at all happy.  This is my 4th bottle and they have all done the same thing - wish they could redesign or do something with the bottle to prevent this from happening.  I now put some in another container when travelling and keep it in a plastic bag at home (which ends up making a mess of the bag, but better than my drawer).</li>
    <li> Works well in my hair.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Works great , hair feels smooth and only need a tiny drop.</li>
    <li> Must buy!!&lt;br /&gt;It smooths the frizziness and leaves hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;It helps to when you&#x27;re blowdrying your hair, makes it easier.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years. This is a big size that will last a while! Love the product, leaves hair soft and shiny without making it greasy. Only need a small dime size amount for shoulder length heir. One negative is the bottle leaks if laying down. Make sure to keep upright!!!</li>
    <li> Love The smell and it keeps my hair shiny</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy, colored hair and I swim nearly every day.  This stuff makes my hair soft shiny and super easy to style, without making it flat or greasy.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Keeps those wonderful curls of mine curly all day and does not let it frizz out.  It works great on my wet, damp or dry hair!!!  Can not live with out it</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  Whether I apply it when my hair is damp or dry, it still makes my hair silky and smooth, without making it look oily or dirty.  Just be sure to use a little-- a little goes a long way!  My hair is to my collar bone, and I use about a quarter-size amount.  Also, it smells ridiculously good!  I get so many compliments on my hair now!  I am SO IN LOVE with Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I use a dime size amount on my shoulder length hair and it leaves my hair extremely soft, silky and shiny. It does not feel weighed down or greasy. This is one of the best products out there and I have tried a TON. I just hope they continue making it!</li>
    <li> Really works as it says it does. Argan oil itself is incredible. I have medium thick, long hair so I use about a dime size amount on damp hair; personally I think it works much better on damp hair. If you use too much you WILL have bad results. Even for straight, mostly undamaged hair it improves the look and feel immensely. Absolutely love it. (PS smells good too:)</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I use it every day and the only complaint I have is that bottle that it comes in-when you get the item it is usually leaky, and make sure not to tip it on its side as it will just come out.  My recommendation is to get a different bottle for it once you get it, but definitely try it!</li>
    <li> My new favorite - silky not oily, shiny not greasy.</li>
    <li> This product works great to control friz and provide shiny healthy hair.  I would recommend it to anyones hair styling routine. They&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
    <li> I love it! Smell great! Make my hair shiny and soft. Tangle free my hair but don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
    <li> love this stuff for dry hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s priced lower than I can find it locally.</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my hair so soft and you can use it after towel drying your hair and leave it, or you can use it prior to heat styling. Smells good too</li>
    <li> I love this stuff more then I can say!! I would have never used it, but got a sample from Ulta and thought, \\&quot;What the hey!\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t use conditioner in my hair in months since getting this! As a natural red head I have very course \\&quot;unruly\\&quot; hair...this has been amazing for me! Plus, my hair has grown at least 2 inches in less then 2 months...I don&#x27;t know if the growth is from this or not...but either way, I know the softness and shine is :)</li>
    <li> I color my hair and this product keeps it soft and it does not feel like it&#x27;s so dry!  I have found that the price of this product is quite a bit higher in a Salon. I am so glad I was able to find this on Amazon. Wonderful Product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a staple in my house!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and it is Great! It has brought about a shine that my hair has never had before. My hair also feels so much softer and looks healthier.  I paid twice as much at salon.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair so smooth and soft and smells amazing. I would highly recommend it to everyone.The best hair  product!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the product. Does exactly what it says it will. My only negative comment is about the bottle. It leaks! I have tried to tighten the cap it still leaks. I purchased a small travel bottle of the product it leaks. If the bottle gets knocked over on my vanity it leaks. The cap that was on the bottle when I first started using the product was fine (2-3 years ago). I hope someone reads this that can fix the packaging.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I was turned on to it  by my hairdresser Tina and by the way is the best.  She started highlighting my hair over the summer and its the bomb.  My hair is so much softer with this!!!!:)I would highly recommended it to everyone out there that needs a little tlc the name says it all Healthy and Sexy!!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money.  I have very curly hair and it made my hair dry and flyaway.  Cheap products in a general store worked better than this product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I liked this product it works pretty good as far a restoring some of the natural oils to damaged hair.  I color my hair alot so I always use some sort of product on my hair like a hair oil.  I like this one but it hasn&#x27;t blown the other&#x27;s I have used out of the water.  But for the price it is great and I would probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I was almost going to leave a \\&quot;don&#x27;t bother\\&quot; review for this product until I used it in my daughter&#x27;s hair. My hair is coarse, curly and damaged so I didn&#x27;t notice a real difference. I put a little in my daughter&#x27;s already pretty shiny hair that is straight and undamaged and it made it really shiny! Kim Kardashian shiny. I second the suggestion on improving the bottle design in the event it tips over or is packed for travelling. It tipped over and almost the entire bottle leaked onto my bathroom counter. :(</li>
    <li> Great stuff - works best on your hair when its still damp out of the shower. Gets rid of frizz and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue. Best alternative to gel or mousse on the market. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I am never one to write reviews... but considering how much i base my purchases on reviews i suppose i should. I received this product in an ipsy bag just over the weekend. After my shower i put it in my damp hair before blow drying. OH MY GOSH!!! Even after drying and using a flat iron my hair was silky smooth! Normally I had to put a spray in my hair to protect it prior to straightening. that would sometimes leave it a little sticky. then i would have to put a serum in it to make it silky and help with the frizz afterwards. My hair would always be seriously greasy by the time i woke up the next morning and if i ever got even near my roots it would be badly greasy right away. This stuff helped protect my hair against the flat iron and never got greasy. Its so silky! the next day i woke up, my hair is still silky smooth without a bit of grease. i will suggest this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only con is the packaging. It kind of leaks out if you&#x27;re not careful and is messy. This would be way better if they would have put it in a pump.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. i could repurches this over and over again. this product couldent get any better i deffenetly recamend this to all of you reading this right now click add to cart</li>
    <li> It is a great item.. I will be ordering more. Makes my hair more manageable and less frizzy.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> my stylist recommended this product and I am glad I tried it.I love it! has a pleasant scent but is not strong.I use less conditioner and my hair feels silky.It has improved the look and feel of my hair.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair so smooth and soft. All you do is dab a little in the palm of your hand and spread it in your damp hair and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to cut to the chase...Hands down this the BEST, and I repeat, The BEST Hair Oil treatment on the market. I have tried so many brands and my last two favorites were the Moroccan oil and the One and Only Argan oil, and although they did make my clients hair more healthy looking and shiny, they left the tresses weighed down and if used too much, greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have found Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal Treatment and nothing else is better! If you sincerely want nonstop complements and healthy,bouncy,shiny,weightless,Super Star hair you must try this product. A dime size is all you need especially If your plagued with dry, rebellious, colored treated, relaxed or abused lack luster locks; this will be your Holy Grail. The reviews are all true. This stuff is a liquid Gold miracle!</li>
    <li> I love it and use it everyday I have bleached fine hair it keeps all the fly ways down</li>
    <li> This is a must have product, I absolutely love it and swear by it!</li>
    <li> Best hair product I own!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be better than their Leave-in Conditioner which I love.  Prefer their leave-in Conditioner more.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Does not weigh your hair down at all.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly, excellent product</li>
    <li> I have very thick, color-treated hair which can be highly unmanageable. This product works wonders and the scent is delightful. I have used it before drying and after drying....either way, it works very well. Must be careful not to use too much, though....a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this product to smooth fly aways and speed drying time after washing my hair. It is an oily product and does not require more than a dime size amount when applied to medium length hair. Some bottles have a stronger alcohol scent than others rather than a clean soap smell. The number one reason I would consider switching brands has to be how terrible the container is for traveling. It requires being double bagged in plastic and will STILL leak from the lid at more than one point. Transferring to a smaller travel bottle is an alternative but with the oily consistency it will be a nightmare to clean if you miss.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair nice and soft!</li>
    <li> I love it. Great for shining hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> This is like silk in a bottle. My hair has been highlighted and heat-styled excessively, but this product can turn dry hair into soft, shiny hair in one use. I will always repurchase!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! I just put a little bit in my hair, and it works great! No tangles, no problems!! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and I have had it before I could of baught it at any cosmetic store for cheaper price but I wanted fast service definetly worth it</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have dry curly hair and this product helps control the frizz.  I apply it immediately after washing my hair and it keeps it manageable.</li>
    <li> Great hair product for us curly haired. I use this after I towel dry. I put in teaspoon size dollop and it makes brushing my hair so much easier. It is also a nice detangler in my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  It keeps curled hair from frizzing, along with adding protection and shine. Great value.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff always. it protects my hair from blow drying and straightning. It smells great  too. I even use this on my skin because i love the smell so much. it makes my face and elbows soft</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. This makes my hair feel AMAZING! I bought 2 bottles. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> So much better than  buying  this  at a salon....same thing  but  cost less.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that takes care of frizz all day, and soaks into my hair without leaving it greasy. Has a pleasant scent too.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING and makes my hair so soft and shiny! Most products I&#x27;ve tried that do that will also leave my hair weighted down or greasy feeling, but not this stuff! My hair is REALLY long, thick, and has a very fine texture. It tends to be a little more on the dry side so I&#x27;m not sure how this would work for oily hair.</li>
    <li> I love the soy renewal product!  I use it everyday in my natural curly hair.  It adds a touch of shine and leave my hair soft and conditioned.  I even use it on my hand and legs for extra moisture.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shinny, healthy, and happy! Very moisturizing and damage fixing! Repaired split ends and smoothed my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Best product to tame frizzy hair, makes it softer and shiny. I can&#x27;t be without using this product. Must have product and can be used on  both wet and dry hair. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> My hair is over colored so I use this on the ends. By the next morning it looks normal. Make sure not to get it all over or you will be too greasy.</li>
    <li> Works great and good price</li>
    <li> Definitely helps in keeping my hair healthier. Doesn&#x27;t tame my frizzy hair but it does condition my hair nicely.</li>
    <li> This is another one of those &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; hair nourishment products that my hairdresser swears by.  The product is meant to help very dry hair retain moisture, which this one does without feeling greasy or matted down.  After buying it at the salon, I ordered two or three bottles here as I wash my shoulder length hair 2-3 times a week.  Use at most a quarter sized pool and scrunch throughout.  Love it.  My hair is shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Absolutely love it.  Shipping took an extra 3 days which was frustrating. Apply only to your length to avoid grease. I use about the size of a dime with just past shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff!  I have very thick, semi-wavy hair that often gets frizzy (I let it air dry), and I only wash it once every 3 or 4 days.  When I saw the consistency of this product, it looked like it had a lot of argan oil in it.  I thought for sure it was going to make my hair greasy - but NOT AT ALL!  I put quite a bit on my hair, and it&#x27;s never oily!  I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair any more than I normally do.  It adds some shine, helps with the frizz, and especially after the second day it looks even better.  It&#x27;s just more tame.</li>
