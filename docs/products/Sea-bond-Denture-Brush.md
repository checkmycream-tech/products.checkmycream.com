      <li>They still give you the best brush for the $ but do not want it to last forever!</li>
      <li>free shipping WOOT!</li>
      <li>better then all the tools of the trade for cleaning de teachable blades.</li>
      <li>Can you have too many of these.</li>
      <li>so would be OK.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t fit into any tooth brush holder I own.</li>
      <li>Make sure you keep the bristles moist as when using denture cremes and pastes it could cause the bristles to harden.</li>
      <li>This is an outstanding product.</li>
      <li>Each type of  brush does an excellent job and my dentures finally feel clean.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice quality brush for the price, I was pleasantly surprised when I received it today.</li>
      <li>This is easy..</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know a special brush was needed to clean dentures and I am glad I gave this one a try.</li>
      <li>Fortunately found some Walgreen brand at Walgreen&#x27;s and bought up what they had.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold and maneuver to clean dentures.&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
      <li>With the special tip on the handle, this brush is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>She was excited when I gave this to her.</li>
      <li>Use this to clean my clipper blades in barber Shop.</li>
      <li>Bargain dental brush to clean my retainer.</li>
      <li>But, they lowered the price and the quality of their original super brush that literal</li>
      <li>Keep one in dop bag, one in bathroom with denture glass, or bath, at work for quick clean up after lunch.</li>
      <li>This has never happened in all the years I have used Sea-bond denture brushes and that is good enough for me!</li>
      <li>I have had full dentures for over 40 years</li>
      <li>It is a brush, does what many others do and does a decent job.</li>
      <li>One would think with so many toothbrushes that one of these companies could develop a decent denture brush.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>Right?  </li>
      <li>The pick really isn&#x27;t needed on full plate dentures--</li>
      <li>This brush is only ok.  </li>
      <li>Works and reasonable price!</li>
      <li>I usually toss one or two of these on an order that qualifies for add-on sales, because they are just Such a great value!</li>
      <li>Same exact product that you pay much more for in drug and grocery stores.</li>
      <li>I have bought this product in the past and find this brand superior to the others on the market.</li>
      <li>Bruise is super soft.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Would have liked the bristles to be stiff.</li>
      <li>Good brush for dentures, makes it easy to get into all little and big crevices inside and outside the dentures.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The plastic handle could be sturdier and a little more heavyweight.  </li>
      <li>I scrub the dentures multiple times a day and these tough bristles work great.  </li>
      <li>The brush is very soft and after 14 days of use I had to through it out.</li>
      <li>Adequate length &amp; thickness of the handle, brush area seems adequate, has a handy hard rubber pick at the end of the handle, bristles are stiff enough and not too soft.  </li>
      <li>Spend an hour or two with tweezer trying to free a bristle lodged between two of your teeth when it either broke off or came loose from your generic denture brush, and then you will understand.</li>
      <li>The brush is just too soft.  </li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s so soft, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
      <li>I have used many different kind of denture brushes and they all lacked the ability to get into the small crevices behind the teeth.  </li>
      <li>Helps keep my night guard clean with just a little soap and this brush.</li>
      <li>Much softer than other denture brushes I have used, since it doesn&#x27;t go in your mouth, it should be stiffer.</li>
      <li>So, as far as I can see your choice are limited!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Would have liked the bristles to be stiff.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Was having a problem finding a denture brush in the drugstore so tried this one. Figured it was a brand name so would be OK. The pick really isn&#x27;t needed on full plate dentures--no place to use it. After a couple of weeks, bristles were frayed and the brush needed to be replaced. Fortunately found some Walgreen brand at Walgreen&#x27;s and bought up what they had. Much, much better.</li>
    <li> definatly cleans teeth well</li>
    <li> Good, strong bristles, works great.</li>
    <li> This brush is only ok.  It does the job after a fashion but need improvement.  The brush is just too soft.  The bristles need to be firmer to brush dentures.  I&#x27;ve used some brands that are much better.</li>
    <li> These are really great.  Came in good packaging too.  Like the contour shape.</li>
    <li> Great bargain. Works as promised</li>
    <li> I have used many different kind of denture brushes and they all lacked the ability to get into the small crevices behind the teeth.  With the special tip on the handle, this brush is fantastic.  Each type of  brush does an excellent job and my dentures finally feel clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I have bought this product in the past and find this brand superior to the others on the market.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and serves it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
    <li> I was told that there was no such product. I always felt that brushing provides the best cleansing because of the direct contact. This is an outstanding product.</li>
    <li> Adequate length &amp; thickness of the handle, brush area seems adequate, has a handy hard rubber pick at the end of the handle, bristles are stiff enough and not too soft.  The plastic handle could be sturdier and a little more heavyweight.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Works very well. It is bulky. But, it helps in cleaning your dentures. Make sure you keep the bristles moist as when using denture cremes and pastes it could cause the bristles to harden. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice quality brush for the price, I was pleasantly surprised when I received it today. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works and reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Good brush for dentures, makes it easy to get into all little and big crevices inside and outside the dentures.</li>
    <li> Use this to clean my clipper blades in barber Shop. better then all the tools of the trade for cleaning de teachable blades.</li>
    <li> The Sea Bond denture cleaning brush has always done a good job for me.</li>
    <li> It is a brush, does what many others do and does a decent job.</li>
    <li> This is the second brush in 20 years.  Speaks for itself.  Lasts a long time and the bristles stay firm</li>
    <li> I scrub the dentures multiple times a day and these tough bristles work great.  The double sided feature with a different shape for each brush is a plus.  I have used this for months and there is no sign of wear whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This Brush was not in a sealed package.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a denture brush...looks just like the picture...it works...what more is there to say? I wish they had pastel colors though...</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. Bruise is super soft. I find it not comfortable to hold and it doesn&#x27;t fit into any tooth brush holder I own. Will not buy another one. One would think with so many toothbrushes that one of these companies could develop a decent denture brush.</li>
    <li> I use a denture toothbrush for house cleaning, not hygiene.  The bristles at not very strong for my needs.  I will try others in the future.</li>
    <li> My Mom loves this sea bond denture brush.  She was excited when I gave this to her. GREAT Product! I will recommend this to my grandmother.</li>
    <li> Very good denture brush! Cleans well at a great price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful..They are so hard to find.</li>
    <li> Know that you might get different color.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband after his dentist recommended it but we could not find any in local stores.  He is very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Helps keep my night guard clean with just a little soap and this brush. Works well.</li>
    <li> B ought this for my mom  she likes it says it works great</li>
    <li> Still the best denture brush around---But, they lowered the price and the quality of their original super brush that literal lasted forever! So, as far as I can see your choice are limited! They still give you the best brush for the $ but do not want it to last forever!</li>
    <li> Once I got used to the shape, the brush does an excellent job of cleaning.  I had shopped locally but had not found a brush that seemed satisfactorily.  Am very pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> Another great Amazon value! I usually toss one or two of these on an order that qualifies for add-on sales, because they are just Such a great value! Same exact product that you pay much more for in drug and grocery stores. Also like this brush because of the two kinds of bristles and the little rubber picks at the end.</li>
    <li> This brush does a good job of cleaning particles from between the teeth in my removable bridge.</li>
    <li> These are great denture brushes</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know a special brush was needed to clean dentures and I am glad I gave this one a try. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Durable hardworking brush</li>
    <li> Good product, it works really well, easy to use, I never have purchased one like this before, thank you for the good product, great seller fast shipping also.</li>
    <li> This denture brush is so well made that it feels like it will last for a long time. My hubby is now able to keep those nasty germs off from his dentures.</li>
    <li> I like the brush, but the handle is just too big.  I hate just leaving it on the counter or in a glass.  That&#x27;s just too cheesy, but the handle doesn&#x27;t fit into any toothbrush holder that&#x27;s a standard size.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning! That&#x27;s why I bought it!</li>
    <li> Very effective brush at a good value and a convenient way to get it.</li>
    <li> I just got drntures. Can you have too many of these. Keep one in dop bag, one in bathroom with denture glass, or bath, at work for quick clean up after lunch.</li>
    <li> Bargain dental brush to clean my retainer. Great value when purchased as an add-on item...free shipping WOOT! This is a great device for brushing off the schmootz from my removable dental appliance</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve found in almost 50 years!</li>
    <li> good item i will buy it again</li>
    <li> This is easy.. Hmmmm... It&#x27;s a denture brush and it brushes dentures.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you for reading this review.</li>
    <li> Why bother to write a review about a denture brush?  I mean it is just a denture brush. Right?  Wrong.  It is a Sea-bond Denture Brush and that makes all the difference in the world.  I have had full dentures for over 40 years so I have some expertise when I say that all denture brushes are not created equally. Spend an hour or two with tweezer trying to free a bristle lodged between two of your teeth when it either broke off or came loose from your generic denture brush, and then you will understand. This has never happened in all the years I have used Sea-bond denture brushes and that is good enough for me!</li>
    <li> God product, good service.</li>
    <li> Much softer than other denture brushes I have used, since it doesn&#x27;t go in your mouth, it should be stiffer. Because it&#x27;s so soft, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> The brush is very soft and after 14 days of use I had to through it out.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold and maneuver to clean dentures.&lt;br /&gt;Soft bristles that will not damage the dentures.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with the brush.</li>
    <li> This denture brush is great for cleaning your dentures after using the fixodent glues.</li>
