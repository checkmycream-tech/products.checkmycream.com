      <li>But the firmer the bristles, the better it cleans.</li>
      <li>I purchased a 4 pack of the Tung tongue brushes along with 4 more tubes of the Tung Brush Gel.  </li>
      <li>Love this thingy.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THESE.</li>
      <li>I prefer this product over the tongue scraper and able to get more cleaning out of it as well.  </li>
      <li>Effective, sturdy, durable, and comfortable to use.    </li>
      <li>I also love the gel and find that it works even better in combination.</li>
      <li>It seems as though using tongue scrapers were somehow a better idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure...</li>

      <li>Really works good on cleaning and freshening your mouth.</li>

      <li>however, I have always come back to the TUNG Brush as it is the most effective and easiest to use.</li>
      <li>I brush my tongue regularly with this product, which is stiffer than my toothbrush, making my tongue taste &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; to me after a good scrubbing.  </li>
      <li>You will experience a super clean mouth and breath.</li>
      <li>cleans my tongue like nothing else ever has.....makes my mouth all minty and fresh.</li>
      <li>a toothbrush that has a higher profile does.  </li>
      <li>However, used gently, this is a far superior solution to a scraper, and won&#x27;t cause you to gag in the same way</li>
      <li>, I ending up making my tongue bleed the first time.</li>
      <li>I first bought the Tung Brush maybe 7 or 8 years ago at a Walgreens.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>Does a much better job than any other product that I have tried.</li>
      <li>a must-have companion to the Tung Gel for the ultimate clean mouth experience.</li>
      <li>It really cleans the white plaque from the tongue and gets it nice and pink.</li>
      <li>I dunno if the gel cleaner is really needed, as i find after i use that i have to use a bit of normal toothpaste to get rid of the chalky taste the gel leaves</li>
      <li>I purchased a similar tongue brush years ago at the local big-name store, and haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.  </li>
      <li>This is so much better than a scraper or tooth brush because the bristles are so firm.</li>
      <li>each brush comes with a tung paste sample i suggest buying the larger bottle its worth it.</li>
      <li>Have been looking for a replacement for my old one.</li>
      <li>It was getting old</li>
      <li>I had tried previously without success.  </li>
      <li>No other tongue scraper works so well.</li>
      <li>Just wet the bristles with water, shake and apply a coat of baking soda from the palm of your hand, brush gently, rinse, and apply again if needed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are not quite as soft as my older brush, so be careful!  </li>
      <li>helps me fight bad breath very effectively.</li>
      <li>so I suggest running really hot water on it to soften the bristles a little.</li>
      <li>It happened with nearly every member of my family who was used to using a long bristled toothbrush prior to my implementing this.  </li>

<li> If the brush were to be horizontal and face down, then the drops down and then kicks up into the air.  </li>
<li> I got in the beginning little bleeding in my tong</li>
<li> But I don&#x27;t lay my my toothbrush down on the counter, and I&#x27;m not sure who would.  </li>
<li> The gel won&#x27;t numb your tongue like regular toothpaste.  </li>
<li> So it makes storage awkward, and it feels a little strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I get dry mouth and develop a nasty film on my tongue.</li>
<li> This product isn&#x27;t too bad when paired with a tongue scrapper.</li>

    <li> I LOVE THESE. USEDF THEM FOR YEARS. BNEST PRODUCT FOR THE USE.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Does a much better job than any other product that I have tried. The angle of the brush is just perfect to get all that gunk out!</li>
    <li> Best tongue brush ever I can&#x27;t find them anywhere except Amazon</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for the tongue!</li>
    <li> This brush is terrific !  I can&#x27;t believe I could not find anything close to this brush in local stores, even Walmart didn&#x27;t carry anything like it.  I LOVE THIS BRUSH !!!</li>
    <li> cleans my tongue like nothing else ever has.....makes my mouth all minty and fresh. I dunno if the gel cleaner is really needed, as i find after i use that i have to use a bit of normal toothpaste to get rid of the chalky taste the gel leaves behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution...do not press down too hard when using it, esp the first few times, I ending up making my tongue bleed the first time.</li>
    <li> I purchased a similar tongue brush years ago at the local big-name store, and haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.  It seems as though using tongue scrapers were somehow a better idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure... because scraping nerves is a superior concept than gently brushing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not quite as soft as my older brush, so be careful!  If used with gusto, you can cause your tongue to bleed.  It happened with nearly every member of my family who was used to using a long bristled toothbrush prior to my implementing this.  However, used gently, this is a far superior solution to a scraper, and won&#x27;t cause you to gag in the same way a toothbrush that has a higher profile does.  Even my 4-year-old said so.  I can&#x27;t say that I like the reversed-angle handle.  If the brush were to be horizontal and face down, then the drops down and then kicks up into the air.  I assume this is supposed to be helpful, but the only practicality I see out of this design is so that when you place it on the counter, the bristles can air dry without making contact with the counter.  But I don&#x27;t lay my my toothbrush down on the counter, and I&#x27;m not sure who would.  So it makes storage awkward, and it feels a little strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said... BUY IT, and the TUNG GEL.  The gel won&#x27;t numb your tongue like regular toothpaste.  It tastes good, leaves your buds fresh, and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years. The tongue cleaners work great.</li>
    <li> I prefer this product over the tongue scraper and able to get more cleaning out of it as well.  Place of order was expedient and came packaged accordingly.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great shipping!</li>
    <li> It gets your tongue clean without doing damage!</li>
    <li> awesome makes my mouth feel cleaner and no cotton mouth in the morning each brush comes with a tung paste sample i suggest buying the larger bottle its worth it.</li>
    <li> Easier than the product I was using and arrived when promised. The paste I bought along with this also works well.</li>
    <li> This is the best tongue brush I have ever found.  My dentist gave me one years ago, and it WORKED!  It was getting old so I went on line and found this one.  I had tried previously without success.  I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 4 pack of the Tung tongue brushes along with 4 more tubes of the Tung Brush Gel.  Really works good on cleaning and freshening your mouth.</li>
    <li> I brush my tongue regularly with this product, which is stiffer than my toothbrush, making my tongue taste &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; to me after a good scrubbing.  I just use my own toothpaste with it.  Works great!</li>
    <li> If you have to do this, then this is the best cleaner on the market.  Plus, buying them on Amazon is the best deal out there.  Get the gel cleaner, also.</li>
    <li> It make the difference. It has really good cleaning abilities. All what you need to do is to use the Tung Gel with it and you will notice a difference. I got in the beginning little bleeding in my tong however that got away after periodic use of the brush. It is not that rough though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would need to start from the back of you tong and then pull it forward for about seven to ten times and that is it.</li>
    <li> I have sleep apnea and asthma, so I am a mouth breather. I get dry mouth and develop a nasty film on my tongue. This item is a necessity for me to keep my breath and mouth in check. I had purchased a TUNG brush and scraper at a local grocer several years ago and have not found them anywhere since (checked multiple stores in two states!) so I was overjoyed finding them on here. I also ordered another TUNG scraper and TUNG gel.</li>
    <li> Love this thingy.  Bought the four pack to use in our cottage, throw a couple in our Disney Owner&#x27;s Lockers, for travel, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my extended review here [[ASIN:B00005BAWO The Original TUNG Brush - Tongue Cleaner with TUNG Gel Sample]]</li>
    <li> I first bought the Tung Brush maybe 7 or 8 years ago at a Walgreens. Now, I&#x27;m not really able to find it at stores near me. It really cleans the white plaque from the tongue and gets it nice and pink. This is so much better than a scraper or tooth brush because the bristles are so firm. This can make your tongue sore and/or bleed so I suggest running really hot water on it to soften the bristles a little. But the firmer the bristles, the better it cleans. And the older the Tung Brush is, it won&#x27;t be as stiff. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product forever</li>
    <li> I think everyone should have one of those.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to order the Tongue Gel with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;You are gonna love the product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I knew this from buying this product in single packaging: it is common for the tongue to bleed in a few places for the first few days/the first week. keep using it, though, and it will go away after the tongue gets used to it.&lt;br /&gt;really cleans it well. helps me fight bad breath very effectively.</li>
    <li> This is the best tongue cleaner on the market. Effective, sturdy, durable, and comfortable to use.    I have found that using ordinary baking soda with this brush does a terrific job of removing the white plaque from the tongue. Just wet the bristles with water, shake and apply a coat of baking soda from the palm of your hand, brush gently, rinse, and apply again if needed. You get used to the briny taste.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a replacement for my old one. No other tongue scraper works so well. Gives great confidence about fresh breath.</li>
    <li> I discovered the TUNG Brush about 8 years ago and since then I&#x27;ve tried others (such as scrapers, metal and plastic, also the Orabrush) however, I have always come back to the TUNG Brush as it is the most effective and easiest to use. I also love the gel and find that it works even better in combination. Please give this a try. You will experience a super clean mouth and breath.</li>
    <li> Works well. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t too bad when paired with a tongue scrapper. On its own, it not all that great of a product. I was hoping that it would suffice on its own but to my disappointment it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> great brush! they even come in lots of colors so you don&#x27;t have to share! a must-have companion to the Tung Gel for the ultimate clean mouth experience. my opinion, of course. wouldn&#x27;t ever want this product to go away.</li>
    <li> I always buy these in quantities along with the Tung Gel.  I use both in the morning and before bed with great results.  Mouth definitely feels cleaner, and you don&#x27;t wake up with &amp;#34;morning mouth&amp;#34;</li>
