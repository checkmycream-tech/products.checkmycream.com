      <li>When I put this on it went on easily.</li>
      <li>Even after the first use my skin felt nice and looked refreshed.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin so much smoother and more radiant looking!</li>
      <li>It really makes the skin nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Others have had better success than I, so you have to go with what works for you.</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth after use.</li>
      <li>Now I add this to my honey and sugar face scrub and my face feels so smooth.  </li>
      <li>I would not have tried this at the original price ($66-$75), but for $19.99, I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn though or feel very harsh, so it is perfect.</li>
      <li>Within just one use my skin looked much more vibrant and smooth.</li>
      <li>I need to use this some more times most likely to see the full benefit of what it can do.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe results so quickly.</li>
      <li>I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Oh I am also 7 months pregnant</li>
      <li>I love that this is all natural and made in the USA.</li>
      <li>For me, it wasn&#x27;t worth the $20.</li>
      <li>I love it because it&#x27;s all natural and contains fruit extracts.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and more clear than in many years.</li>
      <li>This product really made my skin feel smooth just after the first use.</li>
      <li>I have naturally oily skin that is prone to the odd pimple or 2 but for the most part, my skin is good.  </li>

      <li>Definitely a product to try if you want fast and amazing results</li>
      <li>and yes I said 2 times of using this my face is glowing soft fine lines softened.</li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;m old, older.</li>
      <li>This stuff did away with 85% the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I also use a daily, morning exfoliating wash and therefore I can&#x27;t say for sure if this product has helped.</li>
      <li>Make sure you wash your face before applying it and allow it to sit for close to ten minutes.</li>
      <li>from having a first time experience with it this weekend i wanted to write a review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read cases on here saying they felt the difference after the First try.</li>
      <li>My pores looked amazing the next day and my skin was so soft!</li>
      <li>I had a very dry spot that wasn&#x27;t healing from my peel as fast as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>I do a couple other things around the bathroom and then wash it off with warm water.</li>
      <li>You do not get the burning sensation like you do with acid peels but this mask is very effective at removing dead skin and leaving you with glowing soft skin.</li>
      <li>feel slight tingling with it on and skin looks and feels nice after using.  </li>
      <li>They claim 100% customer satisfaction and certainly strive towards that, by their actions.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>The enzyme method of exfoliating is absolutely the way to go for me.</li>
      <li>I really wish this product would have worked for me.</li>
      <li>product really makes a difference</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> OMG, I love this product.  I purchased this product for the first time approximately 1 week ago and I have used it twice since and I have to say, this is liquid youth in a bottle.  I have naturally oily skin that is prone to the odd pimple or 2 but for the most part, my skin is good.  This product made my skin look great!!!  Since using it, the texture of my skin is softer, smoother and the appearance is brighter and flawless.  I had some stubborn dark spots that have been a pain to fade and 1 week later they have improved considerably. Without makeup, my skin looks just as good as when I&#x27;m wearing foundation.  My co-workers have noticed the difference and have commented on how glowing my skin appears.  I am in the process of purchasing another bottle or 2 so that I always have in stock.  Definitely a product to try if you want fast and amazing results</li>
    <li> I like this. I put it on and leave it on all day. It really makes the skin nice and smooth. I feel like that it has improved my skin complexion greatly. It doesn&#x27;t burn though or feel very harsh, so it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Perfect concentration for my skin. I am use to regular chemical peel and this works wonderfully in between peels. I would order again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel any difference when using it. I tried 4 times and nothing. I&#x27;ve read cases on here saying they felt the difference after the First try.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to review and I&#x27;ve been using XFOLI8 for a few weeks now and I LOVE it! It makes my skin so much smoother and more radiant looking! And you only need to use just a little for each application, plus it doesn&#x27;t take much time to use it in your beauty routine either! I&#x27;ve used many facial scrubs before and this is by far much more gentle! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now. And my face feels soft for an hour after use but beyond that I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin. I was so excited to try this product too!</li>
    <li> I would not have tried this at the original price ($66-$75), but for $19.99, I decided to give it a try. I would not purchase this again. This was a waste of money, as I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. Others have had better success than I, so you have to go with what works for you. For me, it wasn&#x27;t worth the $20.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful exfoliating mask. I love it because it&#x27;s all natural and contains fruit extracts. It doesn&#x27;t dry ouy my skin like the acid-based products do. My skin is so smooth after use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this enzyme mask!  Let me start out by saying I used to have oily combination skin, then I hit my 30s.  I was purchasing another pumpkin exfoliating mask that I loved, just didn&#x27;t like the price tag.  I bought this after reading reviews.  I initially had trouble leaving it on my skin but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t follow instructions.  Now I add this to my honey and sugar face scrub and my face feels so smooth.  I follow with my seaberry oil and in the morning my face is glowing.</li>
    <li> Works very nicely, I use it every 5-6 days to get rid of flaking from prescription acne medication (retin-a).  Skin is very smooth, I think it helps my Rx to work better.  I skip the Rx on nights when I use it. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m old, older. I used to work in the dermatology field and take good care of my skin without spending a fortune. This stuff works. I&#x27;m dry, but have had issues with blackheads on my nose and outside edges of my face. This stuff did away with 85% the first time I used it. I have used it now three times within two weeks and keep being impressed. My skin is soft and more clear than in many years. I have no redness or irritation. I love it and will happily endorse!</li>
    <li> i actually just got this product a last week so i havent used to much of it but from having a first time experience with it this weekend i wanted to write a review. I put this on my face as told i left mine on for 10 min you can leave it on for less. then i washed it off with water and no joke i could tell a difference my skin looked softer and more even. i will purchase again when i am out. i recommened to anyone looking for a great exfoliating mask</li>
    <li> I tried this recently and put on a little more than advised to see if it would work. I got this in for a lower cost to try and review. When I put this on it went on easily. There was no burning or stinging during the treatment. My skin felt smoother afterward but I could not tell if it was thoroughly exfoliated or not. This seems like a good product with nice natural ingredients. I need to use this some more times most likely to see the full benefit of what it can do.</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt for a new mask and when I was offered to test a sample I decided to give it a try. Once I tried it, I was HOOKED. This is a great Exfoliating Mask for those of us with sensitive skin. I use my clarisonic once a day and this peel every 5 days. No irritation. My skin always looks clear and fresh the next morning after I use this. The value is also good with this product. I only need tiny bit each time, a thin layer over face. I left it for 7 minutes and then I wash it off. I did not have any adverse reaction that night or the next day. My skin loved it.  I found this Exfoliating Mask is very effective. My skin looks brighter, and smoother! I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Its not what i  expected ,  don&#x27;t  do nothing  for me</li>
    <li> I have numerous masks/facial products from companies I&#x27;ve found on Amazon and this did not disappoint!  I was expecting a bit more burn to feel like it was effective, and still wouldn&#x27;t mind it a tad stronger, however, it does work well!  Even after the first use my skin felt nice and looked refreshed.  I&#x27;m considering trying another one of their products!</li>
    <li> This would be a five star product if I was not allergic to pumpkin !!!! Yikes and ouch!!!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It doesn&#x27;t feel like much going on, but I know it is working because the huge abruption on my chin was greatly reduced after one day of using. I use it every night.</li>
    <li> I was super kicked to try the product, but unfortunately for me it did not work. This review is more for their customer support  and what followed more than anything.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to them stating my issue with the product and that it did not do anything for my skin. They were prompt with their response and almost immediately gave my a refund of my amount. They claim 100% customer satisfaction and certainly strive towards that, by their actions.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I cannot wait to purchase another product from them and have it work for me like it has worked for the others!</li>
    <li> This product works ok. It tightens my skin the next day and at first it did give me a girlish glow.  I use it 2x-4x a week.  The initial effects are not as noticeable now. I&#x27;m half way through the bottle so maybe it&#x27;s already &amp;#34;old.&amp;#34; ... I&#x27;ve had it for 1 month or so...</li>
    <li> This peel left behind such a smooth, glowing result. It&#x27;s an all natural enzyme peel that can actually deliver good results which is what we all want. Make sure you wash your face before applying it and allow it to sit for close to ten minutes. No need to scrub or rub off. Just rinse after your time is up and it leaves behind such a smooth result. I was really impressed with this exfoliating peel.</li>
    <li> Have not used it enough to notice a major difference, but the product seems ok, based on the 2 times that I have used it thus far.</li>
    <li> Love this exfoliating mask. Within just one use my skin looked much more vibrant and smooth. I use this in combination with the resurfacing night cream. Great Combo! My skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for great results thus far only slow and still waiting to see a major difference!</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t tell the difference before I used the product then after.</li>
    <li> I will honestly say I had my doubts with this product but it truely did work great! I cleansed my face like normal, applied this mask as directed and left on for 10 minutes. I rinsed it off and was amazed at how smooth and healthy my skin looked. It was much brighter and didn&#x27;t look so dull. My pores looked amazing the next day and my skin was so soft! I try to exfoliate regularly with a wash cloth but I end up scrubbing too hard and leave my face red, irritated and burning. Which is what I expected when I recieved this for my review. It did not burn, irritate or dry my skin out. I did follow with a moisturizer however. It was very easy to use and went on smoothly. It was just as easy to remove as it was to put it on. Exfoliating is very important to aging skin as dead skin cells make lines and wrikles worse. I use this once a week and my results have been amazing! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I order this exfoliating serum as a sample for review and evaluation and I love it! I used to exfoliate with a gritty type of formula until I recently discovered enzymes for exfoliating. I have combination skin and keeping the dead and dull skin away is a constant challenge. The enzyme method of exfoliating is absolutely the way to go for me. I love that this is all natural and made in the USA. It comes in a bottle with a dropper so I drop in the full amount of 7 drops in my palm and gently spread it around my face and let it sit (I wash and lightly dry my face first). I do a couple other things around the bathroom and then wash it off with warm water. It&#x27;s way faster and easier to do than the gritty scrubs and much less messy. Most important it&#x27;s more effective for me. I have no irritation when using this and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave it looking red. I am just so happy to have found this. I&#x27;m a busy mommy so I need things to just work and this does! I really love it.</li>
    <li> This product was something new for me. I have applied leave in masks before but never such where you cannot see the gruesome black colored mask on your face looking horrific. This is a clear liquid.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is the dropper cover which makes application very easy and non messy.&lt;br /&gt;The liquid is very clear hence you will never look scary while you have this applied on your face. Just 5-7 drops for 10 minutes and wash it off. You can feel the smoothness on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin with redness around my cheeks. This product has my skin improving each day. Mostly products give me a tingling feeling around me face but this product did not leave any weird feeling at all. I could not make out that i did apply anything on my face. I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.&lt;br /&gt;This product really makes a difference and i totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this product. I will not let this product run out!!! After only 2 and yes I said 2 times of using this my face is glowing soft fine lines softened. I can&#x27;t believe results so quickly. The mirror doesn&#x27;t lie though. My face is just so soft.I had no bburning or irritation from this product at all. I do get lactic acid peels. I had a very dry spot that wasn&#x27;t healing from my peel as fast as I would have liked. I took a chance and used this product on the spot. To my surprise the following evening after using this product the rough spot was gone. I was getting worried that the spot would not heal. That perhaps I left the lactic acid on too long. Maybe I did maybe I didn&#x27;t but the spot is completely healed. I highly suggest this product. I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful words about it. Oh I am also 7 months pregnant and I can use this product. I asked my obgyn and she said yes. Now I have that pregnancy glow. I can tell you I did not have a glow at all. My skin was broken out dull just uugghh. I wanted to hide. Now look out I am ready to see the world again. Thank you :) I am extremely happy</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I ordered it on a Friday and it was delivered the next day, couldn&#x27;t believe it. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product really made my skin feel smooth just after the first use. I&#x27;m excited that I have found a company that I have a good feeling about and will be ordering more of there products.</li>
    <li> Modern way to exfoliate. Leaves skin very soft and fresh without harsh grains.</li>
    <li> Love product&#x27;s sensation on my skin. It is very easy to use, no tingling sensation and leaves the skin looking clean and smooth</li>
    <li> Very, very mild exfoliant. Doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell and doesn&#x27;t leave a crunchy mess on your face. It&#x27;s actually a runny liquid that doesn&#x27;t leave a gross film. It doesn&#x27;t burn, either. My fave feels amazing after using this! I definitely recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> great product.  works well on clearing clogged pores.</li>
    <li> Worthless product.  Felt like I was rubbing water on my face.  I tried this stuff for over a month with absolutely no results.  Sadly a waste of money</li>
    <li> Sadly, this stuff really irritated my skin. I followed all of the directions carefully, but it did not agree with my skin. My face was red for several days and broke out with bumps on my forehead and cheeks (not acne bumps, just small, raised, rash-like bumps). I will say, however, that the majority of users seem to really benefit from this product, and the customer service is great. I really wish this product would have worked for me.</li>
    <li> this &#x27;mask&#x27; is very thin, doesn&#x27;t feel like a mask, but it seems to work!  feel slight tingling with it on and skin looks and feels nice after using.  only used once, we&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and bought this product as an all natural treatment to prevent the buildup of blackheads and deep clean my pores, especially around my nose. However, I never notice that &#x27;tingling&#x27; sensation and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to feel any different when I rinse it off. I also use a daily, morning exfoliating wash and therefore I can&#x27;t say for sure if this product has helped. I bought it along with the Vitamin C serum and eye cream - both of which have made a drastic difference in my skin - so I&#x27;ll keep using the Xfoli8 while I&#x27;ve got it, but would highly recommend the Vitamin C serum if you don&#x27;t have highly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this mask. You do not get the burning sensation like you do with acid peels but this mask is very effective at removing dead skin and leaving you with glowing soft skin.</li>
    <li> it did&#x27;n work as well for me. it work in some area</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference after using product!</li>
    <li> I like this, dont use to ofter, I would buy again</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> For the price it is helpful.  I use Clarisonic afterwards.</li>
    <li> This peel works so well! I have been using it for a little while now and I have noticed that my skin is smoother and looks healthier than it ever has! I haven&#x27;t been having the problems with black heads on my nose like I usually do. I can&#x27;t wait to see if there are any other benefits that result in me using this! I will be buying another bottle after I finish with this one! You can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this peel!</li>
