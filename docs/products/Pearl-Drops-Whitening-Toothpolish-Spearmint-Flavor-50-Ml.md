      <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll still be able to order from this vendor when I need to restock.</li>
      <li>Worth it!!</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly and was just as described in the ad.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as strong a whitening as it used to be but it works better,is cheaper and easier than anything I have tried since 1980, and believe me I have tried everything.</li>
      <li>I have used Pearl Drops for years and love the clean and fresh feeling after brushing!  </li>
      <li>Wish that it was still available in drug stores here in US.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I used to &#x27;stockpile&#x27; it, buying it in quantity.</li>
      <li>This used to be available everywhere, and was useful and safe to use when the ol&#x27; plaque built up a bit.  </li>
      <li>works awesome and love how it turns ur teeth back to the white side and quick!</li>
      <li>If you want REALLY clean, smooth,and glossy teeth...</li>
      <li>I have tried several on here and all were good.</li>
      <li>I started using it a week ago and already notice my teeth returning to a lighter more normal color.</li>
      <li>The most important thing to do of course is FLOSS daily.</li>
      <li>My mom had raved about these, so since I couldn&#x27;t find them in the US, I went onto Amazon and was pleased to find them at such a cheap price.  </li>
      <li>And I find it worth the money.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>like when you leave the dentist&#x27;s after a cleaning, this is the right stuff for you.</li>
      <li>So I was really surprised when I had to restock and found it not to be available anylonger in the U.S.</li>
      <li>I like to brush once every month or so with Pearldrops, brush daily with tooth paste but my teeth feel so much better when I use pearl drops.  </li>
      <li>Didnt taste exactly like the one I used to purchase in USA</li>
      <li>Been using it for years to whiten and brighten my teeth with no ill effects.</li>
      <li>Spearmint is not my favourite flavour and the product is a little more liquid than remembered, and I still haven&#x27;t really found a replacement for the original pearl drops</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for adding it to your list of products.  </li>
      <li>Pearl Drops tooth polish really works for me.</li>
      <li>I think I paid too much</li>
      <li>This is really &amp;#34;Great Stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It really does work as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I really like Pearl Drops Toothpaste hahaha.</li>
      <li>Sodium Monofluorophosphate is what gives that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling, the sodium flouride is what is in most other toothpastes like Crest, Colgate, etc.  </li>
      <li>Many of the Pearl Drops items on Amazon don&#x27;t list their active ingredient......</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference, I think it would be much better just to go to the dentist, at least it will work for sure)</li>
      <li>This is the only place I have been able to purchase it in the last year or so.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to everyone except children under 10 years old.  </li>
      <li>This is the only toothpolish that I have found that actually makes your teeth FEEL clean.</li>
      <li>When they reconfigured the old formula to the new, they got rid of the Sodium Monofluorophosphate and changed to sodium flouride.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After less than one week of brushing twice daily, the most noticeable of the tea stains are gone.</li>
      <li>50ml (~1.7oz) for a similar price as the normal 3oz size.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Spearmint is not my favourite flavour and the product is a little more liquid than remembered, and I still haven&#x27;t really found a replacement for the original pearl drops</li>
    <li> Excellent! This is the only toothpolish that I have found that actually makes your teeth FEEL clean. I don&#x27;t know why they quit making?/carrying it!</li>
    <li> 50ml (~1.7oz) for a similar price as the normal 3oz size. Also, the box was labeled with the price \\&quot;99p\\&quot; which is about US$1.60.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product but shipping and handling is just to high. At this rate I will never order it from Amazon.  It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for reducing hardening buildup on teeth.  I have been using this product for over thirty years.  I ordered a lot of it this time because I heard it was going to be discontinued.  I did that once before on a product, ordering cases of a discontinued product, and then someone bought out the trademark and formula and put it back on the market -- I still have cases left after three years!  Hope someone resurrects the product as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I&#x27;ve used it for over 10 years.  It&#x27;s no longer sold in stores.  This is the only place I have been able to purchase it in the last year or so.  Thanks so much for adding it to your list of products.  I highly recommend it to everyone except children under 10 years old.  TRY IT!  YOU&#x27;LL LOVE THE RESULTS!</li>
    <li> Earlier in the year, I switched from soda to unsweetened iced tea to save money and calories. A few months later I did a double take at the bathroom mirror when I realized my teeth were showing stains around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered that my cigarette smoking, coffee drinking parents used Pearl Drops and I looked for the product every time I was out shopping. No luck in the stores, but I found it here at Amazon.com and ordered two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After less than one week of brushing twice daily, the most noticeable of the tea stains are gone. By next week I expect my teeth will be completely back to white. Pearl Drops tooth polish really works for me.</li>
    <li> Can anyone tell me if this contains Sodium Monofluorophosphate?  When they reconfigured the old formula to the new, they got rid of the Sodium Monofluorophosphate and changed to sodium flouride.  Sodium Monofluorophosphate is what gives that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling, the sodium flouride is what is in most other toothpastes like Crest, Colgate, etc.  Many of the Pearl Drops items on Amazon don&#x27;t list their active ingredient......hmmmmm....I wonder why.  When I bought one that didn&#x27;t list the active ingredient, it came and was sodium flouride and tasted like a sweaty foot.  Please list active ingredient!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. Been using it for years to whiten and brighten my teeth with no ill effects. Great taste not sweetened!  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> My mom had raved about these, so since I couldn&#x27;t find them in the US, I went onto Amazon and was pleased to find them at such a cheap price.  She had talked about this being a great polish that used to leave her with that &#x27;just from the dentist feel&#x27;....I cannot say that I notice this being any different than my regular toothpaste.  I will say however, that I like the flavor and like the design of the bottle...it&#x27;s far less messy than my regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I Love Pearl Drops! Been using the product for over 10 years! NEVER have problems with tarter build up or yellowing, stained teeth! Wish that it was still available in drug stores here in US. Since it isn&#x27;t, I will continue to pay extra for it and get it online here!! Worth it!!</li>
    <li> What can I say? I really like Pearl Drops Toothpaste hahaha. I have tried several on here and all were good. Since it is no longer in stores these tubes can be more expensive then regular toothpaste. But for me it takes forever to go through an entire tube. As my dentist once told me you don&#x27;t need to use a lot or any actually. So I just use a small amount for the taste. The most important thing to do of course is FLOSS daily. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have used Pearl Drops for years and love the clean and fresh feeling after brushing!  Also, I was recently asked what product I use to keep my teeth so white. My immediate reply was &amp;#34;Pearl Drops&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Like the product.  Dont really care for the packaging as the toothpolish tends to leak into the bottom of the pedestal base of the package.  Messy.  Can always turn it upside down, but then you have to shake it to get the product back down to the opening. Simple diaphram design that would open when you squeeze and closes when you release would solve this issue.  Note the package had to ship from the UK.  Anyone know why this is no longer sold in the US?</li>
    <li> This is a back up supply see my other review on this product, it should give you the information you might want to know.</li>
    <li> I have used Pearl Drops for the last 15 years.  Can&#x27;t find it in the stores, so I am very glad I can find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this stuff was, but it was not even close to the pearl drops toothpaste I had as a kid.&lt;br /&gt;BTW: I dumped out the toothpaste and added my own - I like the applicator.</li>
    <li> It really does work as advertised.  My wife&#x27;s dentist is amazed at the whiteness of her teeth at her age.</li>
    <li> Didnt taste exactly like the one I used to purchase in USA but it was close. The toothpaste worked great.</li>
    <li> Not like the Pearl Drops I used in the 1970s...I think I paid too much but oh well, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. It only had one flavor back them...</li>
    <li> works awesome and love how it turns ur teeth back to the white side and quick! definately works for in between dentists visits</li>
    <li> This used to be available everywhere, and was useful and safe to use when the ol&#x27; plaque built up a bit.  It is too bad that it now has to be imported and is hard to find.  I am glad that Amazon is still carrying it.</li>
    <li> Glad to be able to get it.</li>
    <li> It was everything I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love Pearl Drops tooth polish And I have used it since 1980. I smoked for 11 years and this was the only thing that kept my teeth completely white. No one from my work even knew that I smoked because my teeth were so white. They stopped selling it in the U.S. I quit smoking so I thought I wouldn&#x27;t need it but I started drinking lots of coffee instead. As soon as I quit using it my teeth started getting yellow. I&#x27;m glad I can get it again from amazon. I started using it a week ago and already notice my teeth returning to a lighter more normal color. Hopefully I can get my teeth white again. It&#x27;s not as strong a whitening as it used to be but it works better,is cheaper and easier than anything I have tried since 1980, and believe me I have tried everything.</li>
    <li> I like to brush once every month or so with Pearldrops, brush daily with tooth paste but my teeth feel so much better when I use pearl drops.  Excellent product, delivered untra fast, I can smile again.</li>
    <li> This is really &amp;#34;Great Stuff&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used it ever since the 1980&#x27;s when it could be purchased in the U.S. Fortunately I used to &#x27;stockpile&#x27; it, buying it in quantity. So I was really surprised when I had to restock and found it not to be available anylonger in the U.S. If you want REALLY clean, smooth,and glossy teeth...like when you leave the dentist&#x27;s after a cleaning, this is the right stuff for you. It was more than I wanted to pay but that is now the going price to obtain this product. And I find it worth the money. It arrived very quickly and was just as described in the ad. Hopefully I&#x27;ll still be able to order from this vendor when I need to restock.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference, I think it would be much better just to go to the dentist, at least it will work for sure)</li>
