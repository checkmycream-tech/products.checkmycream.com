      <li>so I ended up ordering more.</li>
      <li>Great soap, I highly recommend it !</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love to use it on my newer tattoos.</li>
      <li>I have over 9 tattoos, and for my latest bunch I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been great for that and is really convenient; however!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>great soap for new tattoo.</li>
      <li>So far great</li>
      <li>It is very mild</li>
      <li>Seems to do the job fine.</li>
      <li>Fine for tbe smLl ones though.</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin and this also good for that.</li>
      <li>Fantastic, no stinging and moisturizes well</li>
      <li>Have re-ordered so she can continue to clean the area.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars, but it didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
      <li>My tattoo covers the whole top of my foot</li>
      <li>It shipped quick too.</li>
      <li>This here is mild and cleans out the nasty.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Treat it right, Keep it clean, And stay away from Dial.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle but effective, and has kept my tattoo from oozing and the the color vibrant.</li>
      <li>Yes its small, but this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used, so gentle on the skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice to just pump out and wipe down your tattoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot and sometimes cheap isn&#x27;t better for what&#x27;s going to last you a lifetime.</li>
      <li>but is worth it.</li>
      <li>It gets the tattoo clean, but I have to use way too much soap in order to achieve cleanliness..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like regular soap that foams more as you rub.  </li>
      <li>Works ok for smaller tattoos.</li>
      <li>Rub briskly until dry.&amp;#34; I have been doing exactly that and not using any water with it.</li>
      <li>but in reality, you&#x27;ll end up using more than that if your tattoo covers an area larger than an iphone (like I did).</li>
      <li>I noticed in other reviews that people have mentioned using it with water, and I checked the H2Ocean site, which says to wash your tattoo with the soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it cleans really well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well</li>
      <li>was very close to leaving 3 stars because of that</li>
      <li>This soap is gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my tattoo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a whole ton of pin pricks on your body.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t care for it much because it dries it out and makes it intensely itchy</li>
      <li>Drugstore antibacterial soaps are effective for this, but I find them too harsh and drying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more than the other stuff</li>
      <li>I get better results with regular anti-bacterial soap for my larger tattoos.</li>
      <li>/&gt;THE ONLY CON (PRETTY BIG CON) -- is the bottle size and amount available.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes because I used this company&#x27;s piercing spray and it worked miracles.</li>
      <li>Works great, removes all the extra ink that using green soap leaves behind after the tattoo will be buying more.</li>
      <li>Like the other reviewer said, this won&#x27;t get the petroleum off your skin - because it&#x27;s super gentle.</li>
      <li>If the way I&#x27;ve been using it is correct, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it until your tattoo is several days old, because if you use it on a fresh tattoo, you&#x27;re just mushing all the plasma and ink around and probably back into the tattoo.</li>
      <li>Seems inadequate to wash a large tattoo (entire upper arm, entire forearm, etc) --</li>
      <li>I was really frugal with the amount I used because of how small the bottle is and how light it became after a few uses.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the record I have a little less than 100 hours of work and have used many different products over the last fifteen years.</li>
      <li>Just because the soap doesn&#x27;t lather up like traditional soaps, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not getting you clean.</li>

<li> I have seven existing tattoos and my aftercare routine is pretty set, but I was looking for a new soap because I can never find an unscented antibacterial soap, and I am obsessed with the H2Ocean spray.</li>
<li> Remember it&#x27;s an open wound and heals like one, so it will feel slimy when wet not because of the soap.</li>
<li> Sometimes you get a scab the is loose</li>
<li> Needless to say, I was left really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Since I spent the money on it, I still use it, but I wash with dial liquid soap, then use the H2Ocean soap after, just to use it up.  </li>
<li> and you can buy green soap in larger bottles at a cheaper cost.</li>
<li> but you have to be careful when washing it.</li>
<li> The soap was not at all drying and lasted for a lot longer than I expected.</li>
<li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
<li> With the soap, a little goes a long way, so try not to over do it.</li>
<li> and she never had an infection as with previous piercing (when we didn&#x27;t know about this product).  </li>
<li> I tend to tap out at around 4 hours or once my skin is heavily welted, the needle just starts to burn at that point, this extends it another hour or so.</li>
<li> I will never buy this soap again - waste of money.</li>
<li> I got my forearm tattooed about a week ago and have been using this the past few days, once it moved into the itchy, peeling stage.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not huge but not too small.</li>
<li> I used this on a bad acne flare up and it really helped reduce the inflammation and the duration of the outbreak.</li>
<li> I like the product but just to small</li>
<li> However I personally believe using dial or bar soap is just wrong.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it as directed on the bottle, which is &amp;#34;Pump a small amount of foam into palm of hand.</li>
<li> I was disappointed when I discovered it&#x27;s not a soap, but a antibacterial foaming salve that you apply to dry skin (already have a similar herbal product).</li>
<li> a star off for the confusing directions...</li>
<li> Longer if we take a break and use Dr Numb too, though I do suggest if using Dr Numb to use it after some work is laid down, an artist told me this helps to get the numbing agent in the skin faster since it&#x27;s already open from tattooing,</li>
<li> Dial is caustic, Bar soap is loaded with funk.</li>
<li> This foam soap helps me pat it on to my tatt without disturbing the scab and having it accidentally come off.</li>
<li> And I hate that it doesn&#x27;t lather up when you use it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yes its small, but this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used, so gentle on the skin and I used it for my forearm tattoo and wrist and they healed beautifully</li>
    <li> I have used the H2Ocean moisturizing foam and cream before and love them.  After my last tattoo I bought a combo box with those and this soap in it.  It says it&#x27;s foam soap which made me think it would be foamy on the skin... No.  It&#x27;s a pump bottle, comes out foamy, but when you rub it on your skin, the foam is gone.  It&#x27;s not like regular soap that foams more as you rub.  And it didn&#x27;t get all the cream off.  After using a quarter of the bottle, I could still feel a film on my skin.  I used Aquaphor one day, and NO way will this \\&quot;soap\\&quot; get that off.  Since I spent the money on it, I still use it, but I wash with dial liquid soap, then use the H2Ocean soap after, just to use it up.  I will never buy this soap again - waste of money.</li>
    <li> Just because the soap doesn&#x27;t lather up like traditional soaps, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not getting you clean. It comes out as foam and you rub it into your skin until it dries. Then rinse. Maybe repeat. Like the other reviewer said, this won&#x27;t get the petroleum off your skin - because it&#x27;s super gentle. Drugstore antibacterial soaps are effective for this, but I find them too harsh and drying. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my tattoos after I starting use this (along with the after foam and cream).</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. I especially loved this after getting a fresh tattoo. It felt really good and light -- which is perfect for a sensitive and fresh wound! The instructions say to use a golfball size on your tat... but in reality, you&#x27;ll end up using more than that if your tattoo covers an area larger than an iphone (like I did). I was really frugal with the amount I used because of how small the bottle is and how light it became after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY CON (PRETTY BIG CON) -- is the bottle size and amount available. My tattoo is not big, its only on the inside of my arm (4x2.5 inches). I went through the product in under a week! Needless to say, I was left really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I was very close to leaving 3 stars because of that but figured I&#x27;d just warn you about it in my review. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It is definitely soap. It gets the tattoo clean, but I have to use way too much soap in order to achieve cleanliness.. And I hate that it doesn&#x27;t lather up when you use it. The bottle also leaks just the smallest amount.. Just enough to be a nuisance when you keep it in your purse (which I had to),</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> I bought the H2Ocean Ultimate Tattoo Care Kit . Loved the soap in it so I ended up ordering more. It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well but it&#x27;s not supposed to lather. You can still feel the slipperiness from the soap though until you&#x27;ve rinsed it all off. The soap was not at all drying and lasted for a lot longer than I expected. My tattoo covers the whole top of my foot so it&#x27;s not huge but not too small. One bottle lasted me about three weeks using two pumps three times a day. Will definitely continue to use the soap!</li>
    <li> great soap for new tattoo. provides an almost calming effect</li>
    <li> My daughter thinks that this is the best stuff ever for keeping her cartilage piercing clean. Seems to do the job fine.</li>
    <li> This foaming soap works incredibly! I love to use it on my newer tattoos. It feels so nice and cold when you apply it and it cleans really well. I just wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
    <li> It...worked? I don&#x27;t know.  It didn&#x27;t do harm so I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars, but it didn&#x27;t do anything special. I had high hopes because I used this company&#x27;s piercing spray and it worked miracles.</li>
    <li> Great soap, I highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> I will get to the point. I have over 9 tattoos, and for my latest bunch I&#x27;ve used this. Sometimes you get a scab the is loose but you have to be careful when washing it. This foam soap helps me pat it on to my tatt without disturbing the scab and having it accidentally come off. Someone on here mentioned a film or left over soap. That is actually from your tattoo. The body starts creating another layer of skin over your tattoo. Remember it&#x27;s an open wound and heals like one, so it will feel slimy when wet not because of the soap. This soap is gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my tattoo. I was given this by my artist, and I swear it&#x27;s all I want to use. With the soap, a little goes a long way, so try not to over do it. You&#x27;re not supposed to use a lot of soap anyway. It&#x27;s gentle but effective, and has kept my tattoo from oozing and the the color vibrant. I would def give this a try if you need something. It&#x27;s more than the other stuff but is worth it. I also have very sensitive skin and this also good for that. I&#x27;ve tried a lot and sometimes cheap isn&#x27;t better for what&#x27;s going to last you a lifetime.</li>
    <li> best tattoo care products on the market right now!  helps to soothe and improves healing time! could not, would not go without this stuff for any of my future tattoos!</li>
    <li> Great stuff for keeping your tattoo clean while your between showers.  Im prone to infections and this was great for keeping my tattoo clean with no issues while healing.</li>
    <li> great soap perfect for cleaning new tattoos</li>
    <li> Love it. You just rub it in. So far great</li>
    <li> Fantastic, no stinging and moisturizes well</li>
    <li> I use this for my navel piercing and it helps a lot! Highly recommend this product. It shipped quick too.</li>
    <li> Great product! Arrived on-time and iin excellent condition</li>
    <li> Works great, removes all the extra ink that using green soap leaves behind after the tattoo will be buying more.</li>
    <li> it really does take the sting out especially after a few hours of work. I tend to tap out at around 4 hours or once my skin is heavily welted, the needle just starts to burn at that point, this extends it another hour or so. Longer if we take a break and use Dr Numb too, though I do suggest if using Dr Numb to use it after some work is laid down, an artist told me this helps to get the numbing agent in the skin faster since it&#x27;s already open from tattooing, so using it at the midway point is how to he gets the max benefit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve known people who have gotten there tattoos infected. I&#x27;ve heard tons of theory as to why they did get infected. However I personally believe using dial or bar soap is just wrong. Dial is caustic, Bar soap is loaded with funk. Two extremes. This here is mild and cleans out the nasty.&lt;br /&gt; I bought two of these and used them on several tattoos. It&#x27;s very nice to just pump out and wipe down your tattoo. I would highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s not a one stop tattoo aftercare item. You need lotion, You need to take care of that thing. It&#x27;s a whole ton of pin pricks on your body. Treat it right, Keep it clean, And stay away from Dial.</li>
    <li> Works ok for smaller tattoos. Seems inadequate to wash a large tattoo (entire upper arm, entire forearm, etc) -- I get better results with regular anti-bacterial soap for my larger tattoos. Fine for tbe smLl ones though.</li>
    <li> I used this on a bad acne flare up and it really helped reduce the inflammation and the duration of the outbreak. Not its intended purpose but it worked great.</li>
    <li> I like the product but just to small and you can buy green soap in larger bottles at a cheaper cost.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I discovered it&#x27;s not a soap, but a antibacterial foaming salve that you apply to dry skin (already have a similar herbal product). not their fault, it was my own mistake. don&#x27;t care for it much because it dries it out and makes it intensely itchy</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter after she had a piercing done as this was recommended. Works great and she never had an infection as with previous piercing (when we didn&#x27;t know about this product).  Have re-ordered so she can continue to clean the area.</li>
    <li> I used this after I had a derma-pen done on my face. It works great and helps me keep the area clean. 2nd time purchase.</li>
    <li> I have seven existing tattoos and my aftercare routine is pretty set, but I was looking for a new soap because I can never find an unscented antibacterial soap, and I am obsessed with the H2Ocean spray. I got my forearm tattooed about a week ago and have been using this the past few days, once it moved into the itchy, peeling stage. It&#x27;s been great for that and is really convenient; however!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it as directed on the bottle, which is &amp;#34;Pump a small amount of foam into palm of hand. Apply thoroughly on desired skin area. Rub briskly until dry.&amp;#34; I have been doing exactly that and not using any water with it. I noticed in other reviews that people have mentioned using it with water, and I checked the H2Ocean site, which says to wash your tattoo with the soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a star off for the confusing directions... I haven&#x27;t been rinsing it off, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. If the way I&#x27;ve been using it is correct, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it until your tattoo is several days old, because if you use it on a fresh tattoo, you&#x27;re just mushing all the plasma and ink around and probably back into the tattoo.</li>
    <li> I use this for about a week after a session and it seems to work great! I do wish they would sell in larger bottles because I end up using 2-3 of these bottles per session(3-4 days after). Still a great product. It is very mild( I think it feels quite refreshing on the still healing skin). I will continue to use this for every session.&lt;br /&gt;for the record I have a little less than 100 hours of work and have used many different products over the last fifteen years.</li>
    <li> Got 2 uses out of it.</li>
