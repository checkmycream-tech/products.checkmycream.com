<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent shaver at a convenient price. Does the job and eliminates all hair, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it daily. Cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times as it is intended for travel. The results have been very good. It feels a bit light in my hand. I&#x27;m used to holding a heftier shaver. That aside, it cuts close - wet or dry - and charges in 110 to 240 with appropriate plug adapter. No need for power converter.</li>
    <li> 1st Razor for my son :)</li>
    <li> Not as nice as previous Phillips electric shavers I have owned, but gets the job done.  Reasonable product for the price.</li>
    <li> I see why this is the number one top rated seller.  I read all the reviews and was worried as this was a birthday gift to my boyfriend.  Some of the reviews listed this as flimsy or cheap or plasticky.  It is NOT.  It is light weight compared to the old razors from 10-20-30 years ago!!!  It DOES have plenty of power.  It also is fully charged fast.  Under 1/2 hour and holds a charge for a long time as long as you aren&#x27;t doing 1 hour shaving sessions daily.  My boyfriend said it sounded like it had no power. He was wrong.  It gave him a baby smooth shave. I know cuz I felt it after.  I worried cuz it was very quiet and me and my daughter tested this razor ourselves on some gnarly leg hairs.  It just is quieter than the old fashioned BUZZZZZ razors.  It did a fantastic job on my coarsest hair.  You may THINK it is not working but trust me it is.  I did try on my underarm hairs and did encounter a little bit of nicking and discomfort but I blame that on the fact that its a hard to reach place and maybe I was pushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and thankyou Amazon for the gift wrap and note card and excellent packaging on a brand new product.  HAPPY CUSTOMER!!</li>
    <li> Works and is decently priced</li>
    <li> It Beat My Expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Description &#x3D; Lightweight, Quiet, Ergonomic Grip, Shaves Closer Than My New Blade, Easy Clean-up, Low Price.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried a wet shave yet. Maybe the whisker pull on my lower neck will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy another for myself or a gift.</li>
    <li> Affordable performance. It doesn&#x27;t claim to be shower-proof, but you can still use it with shaving foam. I don&#x27;t, and I find a dry cut to be just as effective as my older (more expensive) AquaTouch model. It is light and the plastic housing doesn&#x27;t feel like it will hold up if I drop it. It is made in the Netherlands as opposed to my previous model which was made in China.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price. In my opinion, other models have cool features and costs a lot more but don&#x27;t give you a better shave. This model is easy to grip, has the flip-up trimmer, is cord or cordless and is very quiet. Does not come with a carrying case but is still very portable.</li>
    <li> Not as close shave as I was expecting</li>
    <li> I ordered the Norelco PT724 from Amazon after reading so many good reviews about it, especially of how how good it is on heavy beards. I ordered it for my adult son who&#x27;s disabled and needs help with shaving. He has a heavy beard and other electrics I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t stood up to his beard. This Norelco has worked beautifully. Easy to grasp, it hums quietly and performs extremely well. He gets a great shave from it--close, clean, no nicking and pulling, and a shave can be completed within 5 min. or less if his growth is less. Sometimes he skips shaves and the whiskers come in thick and heavy after a couple of days. He hasn&#x27;t had it long, so I need to see how it holds up over a year, but if it continues working this well over time, I&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> Satisfied very much after used it</li>
    <li> the Norelco PT724/46 came on time to replace my old Norelco due to a battery failure. I think a Norelco user would be pleased with this shaver.However, I do think you should offer free shipping like many co.do. Also reduce the cutter replacememt cost.  Lenny Haherman</li>
    <li> Break in period was very short before getting great results. For the money you won&#x27;t do better.</li>
    <li> Works okay but leaves a lot left to cut.</li>
    <li> my man loves the good cut and the ease of the blades with the up n down motion, kind of like the old norelco commercial of the snowman coming down the hill with the smooth but sturdy ride.</li>
    <li> Good daily electric razor</li>
    <li> Close shave, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Exactly what he wanted and it has a nice shave will continue to buy this product when needed</li>
    <li> My old razer was loosing it&#x27;s performance a bit after 2 years, so instead of just getting new blades I decided to look into new razors. This one came up with great reviews, so I gave it a try. I had to send this back after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a beard, so I only shave my neck really. It took 3x as long as my previous electric shaver, and had a hard time grabbing the hairs I guess.  I could feel right away it was ripping the stubble out. The next day, my neck broke out and was painful. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the tech for this particular model, or just the fact that the 3 round blades on this one doesn&#x27;t work as well as the 4 across like my previous, but either way I&#x27;m not about to go through that pain again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back to my old razer I go. I just ordered new blades and a replacement outer foil cover, hopefully that will make it good as new.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver.  I wish I had purchased sooner.  Gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. Makes easy for me and no maintenance , just tap water :)</li>
    <li> Good shaver. Happy with performance.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco,  I have no complaints, the shave is good and has plenty of power.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband.  In the past, he has had several Norelco razors and the very similar versions from Remington, plus a Braun of a different design.  The limiting factor has always been the NiCad batteries, so I hoped this version would be an improvement.  He has only had it for a few weeks now so that&#x27;s no test for the batteries, other than mentioning that the initial charge went quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the Norelcos he had was a high-ticket version with a little reservoir that holds some Nivea lotion.  He said that did make the shave more comfortable, but no closer, and if he skipped a day (or two), it could not cope with the extra growth; he doesn&#x27;t have a heavy beard either  Also, the trimmer head was separate and the regular head had to be swapped to use the trimmer.  He gave it a full year and a little more, but eventually he decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  Also, the blue plastic trim is deteriorating - not so good for a premium product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of discussing a different razor here?  Save your money.  Stick with the PT 724 or a basic variation.</li>
    <li> good product and less price.</li>
    <li> This electric razor exceeded my expectations in every way for the price point.</li>
    <li> Very  happy with this item;</li>
    <li> the trimmer should flip up higher over the heads when in use.  the way it is,  it is harder to use up under the chin.  it keeps wanting to close down.  if it came up more over the shaving heads it would work much better,</li>
    <li> Provides a very close shave without pulling hairs. Really appreciate the way it cuts. Charge seems to be adequate...wish it would cgharge a bit faster but planning ahead and leaving it charging overnight works well.</li>
    <li> The razor charged up and gave me a much better shave than my previous Norelco. I love the fact that I can just rinse it off under the tap, I can keep it cleaner, easier than trying to brush all the little hair bits in the dry state. Excellent razor at a good price.</li>
    <li> Once the razor is charged I had to recharge it after about 2 weeks.  The cutters do a good job.  my concern will be&lt;br /&gt;later when I have to replace the battery.</li>
    <li> Nice razor.  Does the job!</li>
    <li> Love the shave the razor provides and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband its very nice and can shave well. I am very pleased with this product. it arrived on time and I am very pleased with this item</li>
    <li> This product is for my husband.  He says he likes it very much -- does a good job and is fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, should spend more for something cleaner cut if possible</li>
    <li> I have had lots of Norelco shavers in the past, this one is the best one by far!</li>
    <li> I find it very easy to use. It gives me a good shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and safe compare with razor.</li>
    <li> Great purchase and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The shaver is nice and gives a very good clean shave.</li>
    <li> Great for my young pubescent son!</li>
    <li> I like the razor.  I was hoping it would have a device to tell me when it needs to be recharged or cleaned.</li>
    <li> Pretty study. Material looks kind of cheap but I&#x27;ve had it for 4 months and works so far</li>
    <li> Great Shaver-Exceeds by shaving needs!</li>
    <li> does as good as more expensive one. loving it</li>
    <li> I love it, bought as a gift for my husband. Sleek design and works great.</li>
    <li> This razor works very well.</li>
    <li> Shave is ok but seems light and flimsy</li>
    <li> Nice and solid, seems to hold charge for pretty long time, maybe 7 or 8 days between charges, motor seems to be pretty powerful compared to  last shaver. I run the head under water for quick clean up and no problems so far. This was shipped in a &amp;#34;No Frills&amp;#34; packaging, bare bones box, but who really cares about the packaging anyway! At first appearance I was a little worried that I had been duped by the packaging, but it is working out fine. You have to charge this for at least overnight before you use it for the first time. It arrived with completely dead battery. But I am quite satisfied with my purchase. I think it is a good value for the money. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I will be the first to admit that I have very sensitive skin. Hoping to quicken my morning routine I decided to try an electric razor, a quick search lead me to this one. Upon opening the box the first thing that I noticed was a little dusty, not that this was a problem. After charging the product for the recommended 8 hours I powered it up and gave it ago. The irritation was immediately noticeable leaving me quite embarrassed that day, despite this I gave a two more tries to the same result and as such decided to send it back. I give it four stars because it did offer a close shave and I do believe that had it not been for my skin it would have been great.</li>
    <li> so far so good.... I am old fashion and yet to try to clean it with water but will use the brush that came with it after each use</li>
    <li> No friction is not a good package, but it is a good shaver</li>
    <li> PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED, SHIPPED ON TIME.</li>
    <li> Nice little cordless and corded razor.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts through my thick whiskers easily.&lt;br /&gt;I like that you can wash the heads out instead of having to brush them out.</li>
    <li> Great value, shaves good, meets my needs</li>
    <li> Gets the job done.  Nice price from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x60;t the item ordered and described. Same price.</li>
    <li> Gets a very close shave for me, closer than shaving with the grain using a razor. 4 stars because it just doesn&#x27;t seem that powerful and takes longer to shave an area than I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver and the price is great</li>
    <li> Shaves fairly well, provided that you do shave every day.  Have had it for two weeks and so far so good.</li>
    <li> slightly underpowered,but it works just fine</li>
    <li> Once your skin gets used to shaving with an electric razor - about two weeks - this is a convenience that I regret not finding sooner. My shave lasts at most 30 seconds each morning with minimal irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is not particularly close however. I still feel a little rough but since my facial hair is reddish-blond, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great value.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I thought it was too good to be true. For the first month or so this shaver did everything I wanted it to do, not a straight razor shave but so much easier. I was concerned about the speed of the razor from the jump as it always sounded like it was on it&#x27;s last leg but it kept shaving. Today after shaving and cleaning the shaver head the blades,etc popped out. I was ticked and decided this wasn&#x27;t the time to reassemble. Granted I may be able to put it back together but this is not the shaver I thought it would be. Unfortunately for me it&#x27;s past the Amazon return policy.  This is an update on the shaver. The next day I put it back together and it&#x27;s still shaving. I shave my face,neck and head everyday and have done so since Dec 2014. The shaver sounds under powered but it continues to shave like a champ.   I suggest getting a can of compressed air to blow it clean, using the included brush won&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Hubs loves it. Lighter weight than his old one, does a great shave and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> When I cleaned the blades, I discovered that the little knob that keeps the blades in place is a separate piece. In attempting to afix the piece it jumped out of my hand and I can&#x27;t find it. Don&#x27;t know if it can be replaced.</li>
    <li> It chops down unwanted hair like a lucrative logging liaison cuts down a forest. Careful or it will do the same to wanted hair. Wanted hair? What law did it break? Refusing to cooperate. I&#x27;ll be here all week.</li>
    <li> A great value. Norelco is top shelf goods.</li>
    <li> good shaver easy to clean ,.charge lasts me a long time</li>
    <li> Good price and is still going strong.</li>
    <li> This razor really exceeded my expectations!  I bought it as a replacement for my 8-year-old Norelco razor, and the technology has advanced noticeably.  I like the battery life, which lasted 3.5 weeks for me on its first charge.  The low battery indicator and the quick charge feature are also big pluses.  I&#x27;m happy with the closeness of the shave.  The ability to clean the razor under running water works fine, though I don&#x27;t know that it saves much time.  I haven&#x27;t tried a &#x27;wet shave&#x27; with the razor, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option.  Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t take five stars lightly, but if a product DOES all you expect it to do, the rating is deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting a close shave, the shaver is quiet, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for decades.  Tried a Braun and a couple of Panasonics.  The Braun quickly self destructed, the Panasonics irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted an electric razor that actually works on legs. This does. Even if you wait a week. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> had a close shave with it, ......but I came out unscaithed.</li>
    <li> Good bang for the buck in terms of battery life. Decently close shave, although not the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. My only gripe is that there is no indication of battery life aside from a hidden led that turns red when you&#x27;re close to dead. I think you get 1 or 2 half-power shaves when you see the red light, but it is kind of a guessing game as to when it will show up. Still, given that you can easily make a week or two, shaving once a day, you&#x27;re fairly covered.</li>
    <li> great alterative to bladw</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver so I could clean it with running water. Works great as well. Gives a pretty close shave. Will recommend as a great buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent products with a high quality / price ratio. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great and well satisfied</li>
    <li> It is cheaper than bestbuy! I like it!</li>
    <li> I was searching this model at Walmart and Walgreens. They were selling it around $70+. Ulta was similar.&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews on Amazon and bought this for Father&#x27;s Day. My dad said it works great.</li>
    <li> Works great! Stays charged for weeks!!</li>
    <li> Initially, I gave this a raving review. I bought it for my car on the times I am crazy late for work. Charged it once, used it once, worked perfectly. Never charged or worked again. Too late to return. At least I have the blade heads.</li>
    <li> Superb value and shave.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it zero stars.  I bought it May 14th and it broke today.  It starts and shuts off after a second.  Thanks for screwing me out of $40 Phillips.</li>
    <li> Night and day better than the remington&#x27;s I have owned.</li>
    <li> Does everything a shaver should do, only half the price of those in department store.&lt;br /&gt;My dad loves it.</li>
    <li> ordered a replacement to the first, which spun very slowly, and the second had the same prob.  not enough momentum to sever whiskers, but enough to grab aholt to &#x27;em.  ouch.</li>
    <li> Reliable product and the price is competitive.</li>
    <li> Does everything it should and reasonably well at that. I use it with shave cream and it cuts well then cleans fairly easily.</li>
    <li> So far, after one month, it gives a good shave and does so very quietly.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband, he really liked it. Only wish it had a stand for charging.</li>
    <li> Everything was fine. Thanks!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it very much! He feels very comfortable while using it.</li>
    <li> The razor&#x27;s great but, it was displayed with a stand and a small black bag to put everything in. Neither were included with this purchase. I call that false advertising. Specifically chose THIS one because it appeared to have a stand for charging. Live and learn. NO STAND with this razor!!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great price, Great design.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  My 15 year old Norelco (Model??) just wasn&#x27;t shaving close enough.  This one is a big improvement and gives a very close shave.  It has all of options I need including water cleaning and a pop-up trimmer.  I find it hard to believe that anyone would need anything more expensive.</li>
    <li> Husband really likes this.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I am pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> Works perfect and super quiet</li>
    <li> Works great.  Delivered early, no problems.</li>
    <li> This razor worked out pretty good for me.  It shaves a lot faster than my old one did.  I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> When Gillette doesn&#x60;t work since outsourcing to Mexico Norelco is a wonderful breath of fresh air. Shaves quick and close.</li>
    <li> The pictures on the product page are not for this product.  The razor face does not swivel, there is no stand and the product looks and feels extremely cheap.  The up close pictures are likely from the model above this, which does have a tilting razor platform.</li>
    <li> Very weak motor.  Wish they had a normal, corded version of this exact razor and I&#x27;m be happy.</li>
    <li> Everything is good for this price.</li>
    <li> Meet expectations, soft shave in dry. The manual don&#x27;t recommend to shave in wet and is not water resistant. Careful! you have to select the charging stand and travel pouch option to get what pictures offer</li>
    <li> Much quieter than my 2100 shaver.  Seems to shave a little closer as well.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> this razor does every thing I wanted to do .Seems to be  a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and he has been greatly pleased with this shaver, he said he gets a great clean cut, and its nice and smooth. He gives it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. It works quiet and smooth. I used to use an old Philips shaver with two heads, but I would say, the one with three heads is far much better; this three-head shaver touches every single inch of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also gave a coupon for replacing the heads. A great product.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job. Thanks</li>
    <li> I was first put off by the low noise generated; having been use to more aggressive sounding shavers. However, performs better than expected and would recommend</li>
    <li> Really cheaply made and very slow.  Had to return it and actually buy the parts for my older model which was much cheaper and better.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well. However, the razor does NOT include a charging dock like the picture claims.</li>
    <li> Works great. Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Give close shaves-----JB</li>
    <li> Gives a nice close shave it is much better than Remington.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> nice shaver!but it is a little large,anyway,it is cheap and nice!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my last Norelco and it is even better. Holds a charge for several weeks and gives a great shave, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Noreco rotary-head shavers since 1973.  I don&#x27;t expect the closest shave from a Norelco, but if you spend a bit of extra time, it&#x27;s acceptable. But this model, regardless of how many times you go over the facial area, does not give an acceptably close shave, especially if you have a heavy beard.  Do not buy this model if you want a close shave.</li>
    <li> Disintegrated within 2 uses. See attached picture. I should have been suspicious when it came in a brown box. I threw away the box and not sure how to return this now. Most expensive two shaves I have had!</li>
    <li> Great shave and I have a sensitive face. I was concerned about some who said it tears this face up, but this thing feels like clouds floating on my face compared to the remington I just replaced with this. I would agree the RPM&#x27;s are lower than most shavers, BUT it shaves great, so who cares.</li>
    <li> It died. My last Norelco lasted over four years.</li>
    <li> 英语&lt;br /&gt;Shaver good use, bought for my father, he liked</li>
    <li> Quiet and effective, but sometimes I need to stay in one place a bit too long.  Maybe better starting with electric preshave lubricant...</li>
    <li> Great product,  great shave.  Holds charge well.  Arrived in good condition on time.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job husband says on bald head</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> Great electric razor, allows me to shave my face quickly and easily. Does&#x27;t shave super close, I usually do a quick wet shave after using this to catch the remaining whiskers. No irritation.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son, much better than mine.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the money. Would buy again anytime.</li>
    <li> For the price it is ok</li>
    <li> Does not shave very closely. Thus, I&#x27;ve been using it as more of a supplement to traditional razors than a substitute. On the other hand, this is far more comfortable than shaving with razors.</li>
    <li> convenient and clean shave</li>
    <li> Has worked great, so far!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the shaver overall, but it does not cut as closely as Norelco shavers that I have had previously.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot quieter than the one I used to own. This is also very easy to grip and hold. Another nice touch it gives is that it shaves closely, and therefore gives a cleaner look.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this shaver for 2 months and he has a very light beard.  He says it works about as well as the one he just threw away which was 3 years old with original blades!</li>
    <li> The product is poor quality.</li>
    <li> This latest iteration of this shaver is top notch. The charge on it lasts 3x as long as the previous model if you first charge it according to instructions, for a full 8 hours. It seems to be way more comfortable than the previous model.</li>
    <li> Quietly does the job well and is light as a feather to boot. I was happy as a clam with my old (as in 10+ years) Norelco but this one is miles better!</li>
    <li> I have always shaved with Norelco but find this &amp;#34;comfort head&amp;#34; design to be lacking in closeness. I still have an old &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; blades and&lt;br /&gt;have to use it before or after using this one if I wanted a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if they had put the &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; blades on this &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; design we may have had a winner. You do have a comfort shave with it&lt;br /&gt;but not a close one.</li>
    <li> As a man who shaves many parts of my body, I was hoping this would be the easy solution to my problems. It was not. I give it 4 stars because it works beautifully on my face, which is what it&#x27;s designed for. However, I&#x27;ll list how it works on other body parts.&lt;br /&gt;Penis (actual shaft and balls)- Cuts me up something bad. I&#x27;ll stick with a straight razor here.&lt;br /&gt;Pube area- Works decently. Once in awhile it gives me a little razor burn but its quicker and easier than a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Legs- Works well. I use the buzzer first to get the hairs short then the razor heads to get smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Armpits- More cuts and occasional razor burn. Stick with razor here.&lt;br /&gt;Anus- Works well. I use the same strat as legs.&lt;br /&gt;Nipples/chest- Works well. I just ran over with the razor heads, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of chest hair.</li>
    <li> Good design.  Easy to use. Of course, nothing bests a wet razor shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Philips Norelco shaver for years.  The one I had finally got to the point that the battery would not hold a charge long enough to complete a single shave.  After pricing replacement batteries and shaver heads, it made sense to get a new shaver.  So I went with the Shaver 3100 which was basically the updated version of the shaver that I had been using for years.  It works great and with a lithium ion battery, I was able to shave for two weeks on a single charge.</li>
    <li> Reliable. Not perfect but better than previous shavers I bought.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a previous model Panasonic I had. I like the floating head design and for me, there was no &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; period for my skin and the shave to become compatible. That&#x27;s occurred when I used a foil shaver which is more prone to cut or irritate when new. It has a comfortable grip, is attractive looking, light weight and is a cord/cordless model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric shaves are priced all over the board. This is an excellent value that should last, based on previous experience. Only reason for four stars is that it seems a little under-powered.</li>
    <li> A good shaver for the money.  I like being able to rinse the shaver after each shave.</li>
    <li> I am on my third day of the break-in period.  I am experiencing very minimal irritation on my neck only and am very happy with the shave.  It has cut (I avoided a pun here) about 5 minutes off my morning routine and as my face adapts and I can move a little faster I expect more improvement.  I would agree with some other posters that it feels a bit cheap, but so so far the perception is not reality.</li>
    <li> Did not cut close enough  and hard  to clean</li>
    <li> great gift for my dad.</li>
    <li> Use it every day, and I don&#x27;t have to charge it very often at all. It could cut a bit closer.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for many years. This is the first one I can truly say disappointed me. Takes much longer to shave with this razor than the last Norelco I owned and I always seem to have patches that are left with stubble. I know this is not a top of the line razor from Noreco but it should at least work. Time to find another razor.</li>
    <li> I have owned several versions of this razor.  It does not seem as thought the motor is as strong as in the past.  It works OK, but not as well as previous models.  Also, the item is pictured online with a charging stand and a travel pouch... neither the charging stand nor the travel pouch were included.  I will have to buy a travel pouch separately.</li>
    <li> cheaper construction, made it harder to remove heads and clean them. They should have stayed with the old style heads. I will not buy this brand again. I have been buying Norelco all my adult life, however this is the last time atleast on rzors</li>
    <li> economy shaver. and good shave for me.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it and he is getting a good shave from it.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my father-in-law and he likes it so much. It works quietly and is not as noisy as the one I&#x27;m using. The shaving angle is always neat to fit his face. And this price is quite attractive.</li>
    <li> Better than I expecterd.</li>
    <li> works fine, battery is good too</li>
    <li> I buy it as gift for my father.&lt;br /&gt;I think he like it</li>
    <li> The last shaver from this company lasted 25 years--they have improved battery life and style--great company!!</li>
    <li> Works great, for the price !</li>
    <li> Typical China. Sounds and shaves like a kids wind-up toy.</li>
    <li> Super Great shaves and great price</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the picture,  it does not come with a charging dock.  I ordered this because of that picture.  I returned it today!</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver for the price. Gives a great close shave, and is easy to use. you will love this razor, there is a reason why so many have given this a good rating.</li>
    <li> I could not get a decent shave from this razor and ended up returning it. The battery sounded like it was going to die any moment and just did not have enough power to do the job. The directions said to give it three weeks but I could tell after three days it wasn&#x27;t going to work. Everyone&#x27;s shaving experience is different but I cannot recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor (I&#x27;m 62).  It seems to work well  Takes about the same amount of time to finish as a with blade.  I like being able to flip open the heads and wash in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;I can shave close to my moustache, and it will cut a hair if I get too close, but so far has not pulled any.  Also tried to get it to nick me, running it up over edges of my lips and letting skin bunch up / wrinkle up under it, but no nicks or cuts, so that&#x27;s good..&lt;br /&gt;Only oddity is the green charged light wont stay on.  Spec says &amp;#34;Battery full indication&amp;#34;, but no light when full.  It flashes while charging, but when I come back hours later, its not on.  If I unplug it and plug it back in, then the light comes on ... for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Also the battery was 100% completely dead when I open the package - I&#x27;ve never bought a lithium-ion powered product that came with a dead battery - all the others have SOME charge, but not this.  That concerns me a little &amp; I may ask for another.  But like I said, it does a good job shaving.</li>
    <li> in the listing it show that it comes with case and the stand and that&#x27;s why i order it, it came with nothing and its going right back waste of time&lt;br /&gt;they should fix the listing or take it off&lt;br /&gt;thanks for nothing</li>
    <li> Good, Inexpensive daily use item.  Not super fancy, but definitely worth the price.  I use my regularly, no issues.</li>
    <li> Very nice clean shave i didnt even feel it cut unlike the other three i had that pulled and jammed alot this one is nice and quiet havent tried the flip up razor on it yet which i probably wont use anyway cause the three circle blades pivot to get all areas of your face only had it for two days so ill see how it goes    Update 9/30/15  Still very happy with this thing, i went three weeks without charging it and the battery still has plenty of power doesnt even die out still very satisfied</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve experienced, but for the $, I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. Bought my first one like this about 12 years ago and it just quit. Ordered a new one and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Easy to charge, use, clean. Gives a nice shave.</li>
    <li> After having great success with my purchase of the Norelco PQ208/40 Travel Razor, five months ago I decided to purchase the PT724/46 Shaver 3100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 55 days after having received it, and with careful maintenance, the razor began to leave large patches of whiskers untouched on my face and neck.  Going over the patches did not completely reduce the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To check the performance of the razor, I tried shaving alternately with the Travel Razor and the 3100 and found that the amount of whiskers left after a good going over on my face with the Travel Razor produced a much larger crop of whiskers to be cleaned out of the chamber than the 3100 indicating that the 3100 was clearly not doing the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I reported the problem to Philips, they said I would have to purchase a replacement blade kit (at my own expense) which was not an acceptable solution given the short time I had been using the razor.  Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s liberal returns policy, I sent the 3100 back for a refund and would have a big problem now trusting another purchase of a Norelco rechargeable razor.</li>
    <li> It does what I need it to do, quickly and without fuss.</li>
    <li> Shaver works well.  No pulling or nicking.  Similar to my previous unit until it wore out.  The most interesting thing is that it was cheaper to buy this new unit versus replacement heads for the older unit that still ran.</li>
    <li> Excellent item, prompt delivery</li>
    <li> shaves and water resistant. So far working well</li>
    <li> Good as a &amp;#34;traveling razor&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver, everything is ok, but its not included a bag for shaver like in picture! And here is another charger! Here only shaver they put the same!</li>
    <li> great works very good</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised at how well this Norelco shaves my beard.  I have used it both wet and dry and both are acceptable although &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; seems to cut closer.</li>
    <li> Great clean shave. Holds its charge well.</li>
    <li> nice features, but i don&#x27;t like that when the battery is low, it&#x27;s like someone throws the off switch.  yeah, the light flashes, but nobody i know shaves with the unit upside-down, so you won&#x27;t see the indicator light anyway.  my remington R950 would just die nice &amp; slowly and let you finish the job if you needed to.  also, it has TWO concentric cutters in each of the 3 heads and cuts waaaay faster.  i can shave in about 5 minutes with the remington and still use it occasionally since it is a better shaver--even tho it is 7 years older than the norelco.  the norelco only has 1 cutter in each head &amp; maybe that&#x27;s why it takes 15 minutes to shave?  far too over-rated IMO.  edit:  after a few months of use, i&#x27;ve come to the realization this shaver just does NOT cut.  it takes 20+ minutes to shave!  just don&#x27;t understand these high reviews.  did i get a bad unit?  were the others getting free product??  can&#x27;t explain, but this is a one-star shaver at best!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the newer heads as they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as an older model I had. They sound cheap and flimsy.  Also, I was surprised to find Philips didn&#x27;t supply a travel bag (even if it was a cheap model bag). Cleaning this unit is more difficult than the previous model. I don&#x27;t use water as a cleaning agent as mentioned in the booklet. I guess I just miss my 20 year old unit. It worked flawlessly. Maybe this cheap sounding Chinese unit may as well.... time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;As far as delivery from Amazon.... just as they said... no gripes.</li>
    <li> as far as NOW , is awesome. i purchased one before and it didnt work after replacing the piece that cuts .hoping this one last longer.</li>
    <li> Irritates my skin.  Caused me to breakout.  I didn&#x27;t get a clean close shave feel.</li>
    <li> Shaves very good your face has to get used to it after using blades</li>
    <li> does not shave close enough</li>
    <li> Better than nothing.  If you have a very curly beard and have to shave with the grain to keep from getting pseudofolliculitis barbae, this razor is not going to do nearly as well as a fresh old-fashioned safety razor, in a hot shower, with shave oil and shaving cream applied with a badger hair brush.  Maybe it would do that well if you used it in the shower, with shaving cream, etc.  The instructions say you can.  But if you are going to do that, what did you buy this for?  By the time I went to all that trouble, I could have just done it the old-fashioned way.  I bought this to shave in the car.  And for that, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Old product&lt;br /&gt;they should change the technology</li>
    <li> Pruduct is working as anticipated. No problems so far!</li>
    <li> Arrive promptly works very well; I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it gave a closer shsve</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a 7110x shaver for many, many years and put a new shaving head on a couple of years ago.  It has always shaved well.  My new PT724 doesn&#x27;t shave very close - leaves a lot of stubble. I&#x27;m not very happy with it.  I am getting ready to return it.  I am 81 years old and have used a Norelco since I was 18.  I am very disappointed, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas E. Foisy</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave.  The price is right.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver that I have found for the money.  I would definitely buy this as a gift for a family member or friend.</li>
    <li> After 30+ years using Norelco shavers, gotta say I&#x27;m disappointed by this model. Normally, when I get a new shaver, one of the great benefits is getting a faster, closer shave than my old Norelco, whose battery and heads have worn down. But shaving with this model is not as close and is even SLOWER than my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is mainly due to different heads or whatever as another reviewer suggests (though I don&#x27;t see any difference from my previous shaver), but I suspect the switch to a Lithium Ion battery has something to do with it. I was eager to switch to Li-ion, and the charging is faster and more convenient, but the heads don&#x27;t seem to spin as fast, and so the shave isn&#x27;t as close. It&#x27;s more like how the shave was on my old Ni-Cd Norelco when the battery was nearly run down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the voltage on the Li-ion battery is different and that&#x27;s the reason, IDK. I have no idea whether this affects all the new Li-ion Norelcos or just this one, but I can&#x27;t recommend this model.</li>
    <li> It does the job, better than the previous version.  Haven&#x27;t had to recharge it in over a month.</li>
    <li> This is my second PT724.46 shaver, first for some reason stopped working after two years.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, the way it shaves and the long charge batteries.</li>
    <li> This one is one of the best, for the money it works good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for about 20 years and this is my third one.  It cuts like the others, but does run slower than the other shavers I have owned.  It&#x27;s not a problem because it still does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself feels light, which is good, and the shape fits my hand very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Really not sure we will keep it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t replace the battery on my previous shaver. This one looks like I won&#x27;t be able to replace battery either.</li>
    <li> This product was certainly a great buy, to say the least!  But it is of great quality, for sure.  It shaves much closer than my former Norleco Razor shaved.  I can feel on my face, that it shaved much shorter, closer to my skin with no stubble left at all.  That may be because it is brand new, but regardless of that, it does what it is supposed to do and does so well.  Besides the regular features of the Razor in the process of shaving my face are concerned, it does have a little side or moustache trimmer that works well also, for those who may want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to what I have already written, I do recommend using shaving cream with this razor, for I believe it was built to be used with shaving cream and NOT get stopped up with cream, because of the way it is built internally, when you take the razor head off to clean the razors.  By using shaving cream it gives a MUCH closer shave and it highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Close shave and keeps charge for a long time</li>
    <li> My husband has been very happy with this razor. Gives a good shave. It is also quiet to use</li>
    <li> Quiet and smooth shave.  Charges in ample time and holds a charge for several shaves.</li>
    <li> GREAT electric razor, highly recommended. So far I have had 4 very close shaves on one charge.</li>
    <li> Recommends this  product.</li>
    <li> very good razor for the price a very close shave</li>
    <li> works great arrived on time</li>
    <li> works very well and its a nice option to be able to rinse it off</li>
    <li> This replaced an old Norelco electric shaver after its battery refused to hold a charge anymore. Typically I use a simple disposable double bladed razor to shave with, using an electric shavers pop up trimer just to trim some hair over my ears between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this new razor a few times each week to save some time in the morning, and it does a very nice job providing a very close shave. Better than my simple double blade razors do. However, having a goatee along with a small beard above my jawline, the simple disposable razor is able to get to spots that any electric razor can&#x27;t, so I don&#x27;t always use an electric razor. But if i did, this Norelco shaver would so the job nicely. The shaver worked reliably after its initial charge, and cleaned up fairly easily. The parts seem to be very cheaply made, but the head was easily taken apart for cleaning, very similar to my previous Norelco in basic design.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a great value, and am very pleased with it so far.</li>
    <li> My son was thrilled with this!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and he seems to like it.  It&#x27;s very much like the one he had previously.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver for price !!! Dennis PA.</li>
    <li> This electric razor has worked wonderfully for four years and is still cutting close.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-out trimmer helps keep side burns trimmed between hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to keep it clean and lubed with the spray stuff and it should last a while and not eat your face like conventional razors.</li>
    <li> Outstanding performance</li>
    <li> Works even better than I had hoped.  My son is delighted.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  I gives a close shave and it is smooth.  It leaves no razor burn and it is the so easy to clean after shaving.  Trim&#x27;s mustache and sideburns great with little effort.  It is probably the best  shaver that I have ever had and I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a great shaver.  It is a great buy too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 93 year old father. It was easy for him to use.  Gave him a close shave.</li>
    <li> bought for friend, so did not open it.</li>
    <li> very good good product</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used consistently and its been amazing.</li>
    <li> Fantastic electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Stupid n gives me acne every time  I use so I returned</li>
    <li> very good。Arrive on time</li>
    <li> Check out the video  So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So this is my opinion comparing years of using the Gillette razors vs Dollar Shave Club mid range 4x razor    [...]</li>
    <li> the motor spins super slow.  I don&#x27;t know if something is wrong with it or not.  I don&#x27;t want to go to the hassle of shipping it back and contesting the matter !</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because the cost of replacement heads for my Norelco Arcitec 1050x, which I really like,  are now $110 which seems excessive. I expected that the PT724/46 Shaver 3100  would include the stand and travel bag shown in the product picture. It didn&#x27;t. In fairness the product description confirms that it doesn&#x27;t. The shave was ok-not great. My advice - spend the money for a better shaver. Kudos to Amazon for refunding my money no questions asked.  PS I bought a replacement head for my Arcitec shaver.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well. These shavers last about five years and then you have to replace the battery and the cost of doing so is more than the cost of a new shaver. Sad but true.</li>
    <li> My husband is recovering from open heart surgery and had not been able to shave more than  a week.  I gave him the shaver early Christmas present and he was so pleased with it he used it on that tough beard.  It performed very well and he is still very pleased with it.  We then ordered it for my son as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Works good. My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Lighter weight and quieter than my previous razor, so far am very impressed.</li>
    <li> No more cuts! No more lather! I find it best to shave right after showering (and towel drying, of course) while the skin is free of natural oils and debris. For best results, the skin should be held tight, and razor pressed firmly against the skin.</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace my old razor which finally died. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year or so without any complaints. It gives nice, close shaves without any cuts or pulling.</li>
    <li> Nice razor and it arrived on time.  This is replacing the exact same model I had, once it served its useful life.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for he shaves his head.. Works great with no mess!</li>
    <li> It is a good product for a less expensive price, my husband is happy with it, thanks!</li>
    <li> Great item, super fast shipping</li>
    <li> My son absolutely loves this shaver!  He wishes we would have gotten it years ago.  He is dialed and finds this one simple to use.  It&#x27;s the best shave he has had, too.  Very nice shaver.  My husband wants one now.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had in years!  Great value!!</li>
    <li> Works as great as my $100 ones...surprising how smooth it cuts long stubble.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, price, service.</li>
    <li> THIS IS UGLY TRICK ,BECAUSE FOTO PICTURE ASSOCIATED WITH listing showing somethig what push me make purchase.Something means 2 things: case and charging dock.But I received naked shaver,which I can buy easy below $30 .PLEASE NO MAKE future above tricks,simmilar to cheap department stores,which fool around customers.</li>
    <li> Best cutting electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Quiet and a  close shave.</li>
    <li> Great for a close shave on your face... horrible at shaving your neck.</li>
    <li> I use it maybe ten times and it quit cutting my facial hair</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a Norelco that I have used for several years.  I have used various Norelco shavers for perhaps 30 to 40 years and have been generally satisfied with them.  I replaced the older shaver because I forgot to bring the charger cord.  It seemed time to replace the shaver anyway so after reading many reviews and considering the price, I selected this shaver.  This shaver is lighter weight and seems to charge faster than my previous shaver.  As with the last several Norelco shavers it seems to need more work to get a close shave.  With persistence I can get a satisfactory shave, but it does take some work.  I still prefer the rotary shaver style, and this works.  I would recommend it, but expect a rough shave at first and expect to need to work at your shave to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Its okay for what you pay for.</li>
    <li> it is worth the price</li>
    <li> had 3 months and does not give a good shave anymore.</li>
    <li> $39.95 at Walmart.com</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend to replace his old ones and he loves it. He has been using it for a few months now. He said not only that it works real well for his facial hair but also it&#x27;s lightweight compare to the ones that he had before. I believe for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. This is the way to go if you&#x27;re looking for a gift or for personal use. The color is cute too.</li>
    <li> The shaver is very good, but it cannot place stable on the table.</li>
    <li> Great shaver just like the last one I had for years.</li>
    <li> shaver works well but they need to improve the trimmer as it just doesn&#x27;t work we ll- ineffective.</li>
    <li> Close shaves at a great price can be used cordless or with cord plugged in.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor for the price. Shaves close and is much quieter than I expected. I have shaved for 2 weeks now without having to recharge. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Did not come with stand and case as shown. Was only the razor</li>
    <li> As the directions say, give this shaver a few days. Once your face adjusts, the shave will be excellent.  A great razor, for a great price.</li>
    <li> Save yourself a year or two with time spent shaving. Extremely close shave in less than 45 seconds. Incredible product.</li>
    <li> This is my first non-$10 electric razor, and I love it!! It&#x27;s soo much easier and faster to shave versus a disposable razor, even the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Did not expect it to outperform my more expensive Braun shaver, but it does.  Shaves me smooth. Quiet. Easy to clean.  Trimmer is a bit awkward to use.  Bought one for myself and my father.  It&#x27;s his first electric shaver after 60+ years of safety razors.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have owned.  And a serious step up from the 10 year old Norelco that I had been using.  And very quiet.  I&#x27;m happy.  But I bought it on sale at Christmas and I don&#x27;t know that I would have been as happy if I had paid the full list price.</li>
    <li> very nice. excellent set up to use with water.</li>
    <li> Husband likes it. it works well.</li>
    <li> Good price caught on sale works good</li>
    <li> dosent hold a charge. it was charged for ten hours( befor first use) three days passed without using it, and shaver was dead.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and my husband loves his new razor.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!! Every man needs one</li>
    <li> Works well, charge last a long time, shipping was quick. Only concern may be longevity. I bought the cheaper version and it appears that is what I received. Appears to be good value for the money but will know better in a year.</li>
    <li> A very good razor that gives me a good shave, quickly.  It well priced.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> great! I love AMAZON.</li>
    <li> My husband has used a blade razor for at least 50+ years but he decided that he would switch.  He hands are no longer as steady as they once were and the thought of cutting his throat crossed his mind.  So for safety sake he asked me to find him an electric shaver.  I knew about the Norelco brand because my father used one for at least 40+ years so I ordered this brand because of the reliability of the shaver that served my father all those years.  It works very well and my husband is very satisfied with the one I purchased for him.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is great! I love it. And it was a great price too!</li>
    <li> Not in original package, full of dust!</li>
    <li> good，but no packaging</li>
    <li> works good, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was charged 3 times for the same item and was never refunded after three calls.</li>
    <li> Very good razor for the price!</li>
    <li> It will probably last the  year.  My son says it works but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
    <li> My son loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a cheapo from wal-mart and it almost started a fire...this is a good quality one. Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item local.&lt;br /&gt;1st, packaging is horrible! You need a utility knife to saw through the thick plastic packaging so be careful and don&#x27;t slice a finger off!  DANGEROUS!!&lt;br /&gt;2nd, the pop-up clippers are completely useless. There is nothing to keep the clippers extended so if you apply ANY force to the clippers they fold back into a locked/closed position.&lt;br /&gt;Junk and it is being returned.</li>
    <li> First time user and love it. The touch is gentle and it clean very well. The design itself is easy to use considered that I am first time user and it didn&#x27;t take me much time to figure out how to use this. Sort of water-proof I guess but I didn&#x27;t bring it to shower.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, does not have some of the bells and whistles of the 150.00 plus shavers but it shaves like a 300 dollar one. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he loves it. His cheeks are smoother and he enjoys shaving more.</li>
    <li> A very nice inexpensive alternative to expedite my morning ritual. The shaver works well and gets my face baby smooth. I also use it in my bald head, arms, chest, etc., and I can get 3 complete shaves on one charge. It does not get the skin in those areas as smooth as my face, but I don&#x27;t believe it is intended for that usage, so I use it for those areas when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend, as you can multi task while shaving.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this for my very elderly father who lives in another state so I have not actually seen the shaver yet but his home health aide tells me he uses it with no problem and it does the job.</li>
    <li> I had a similar model using the same heads that worked better.  I returned this unit</li>
    <li> One of the best razors on the market</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s the first time that I do shaving and I felt so good!</li>
    <li> Basic satisfaction, commodity packaging, no travel package.</li>
    <li> Handles nicely and does the job.</li>
    <li> my son says it does a great job.</li>
    <li> my husband like it very much！</li>
    <li> nice shaver,and cheap!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. He is very happy with the close shave he gets from the shaver.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight,delivers a superior close shave,reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use and gives a clean shave, very smooth. I had a Philips Norelco before (i don&#x27;t know the serial number, it was a gift) and it worked fine until someone decided to cut the charger. Yes, instead of ordering another charger I saw this product and decided to buy it as a new replacement. So far I love it, it&#x27;s better than my old one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for a couple of weeks and it has exceed my expectations.  I get a reasonably smooth shave without using the water needed for the optional scrape razor. And that&#x27;s no small thing here in California where water is becoming a rare and precious resource.  The reason I purchased this item was to save water, and it&#x27;s doing that; not much saving, but every little bit helps, I hope. I like the ergonomics of this shaver as it is very comfortable.  The floating heads do an excellent job of providing a smooth shave. It charges the battery fairly rapidly, but I keep it plugged in at night, and don&#x27;t take it on trips.  So, battery charging is not an issue for me. I recommend this to anyone needing a fine electric razor at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Really nice razor.  I replaced a five year old Norelco with this item and the improvements are wonderful.  I can barely wait until my next use.</li>
    <li> good ... does what it says ....&lt;br /&gt;not much suited for people like me with beard that grows too fast n thick XD</li>
    <li> This shaver is terrific.  it is just what my son wanted.</li>
    <li> Alright, first off, this is my second electric razor, the first was very cheap and a pretty big piece of junk, since then i have been reluctant to spend any money on an electric razor.  I am not disappointed.  This worked really well especially considering i hadn&#x27;t shaved for about a week before picking it up.  It wasn&#x27;t as close as a razor blade, but i may need to get used to it a little more before i can get those kind of results.  I was really happy it did not pull the hair out like the cheap one i got many many years ago, everything was cut, excellent!  i was able to plug it into the outlet and shave right away which was a plus.  Cleaning it was a snap, this time all i had to do was pop the top and tap it out, ill probably do more thorough cleans on a monthly or bimonthly basis.  The added bonus of a pop up  mustache trimmer was nice, i used it to line up my ears nicely.  Overall, great product as an intro to electric shavers, the shaving experience and the price were both nothing to be scared of.</li>
    <li> works like a new razor</li>
    <li> Nice quick way to shave if you need to shave everyday.High quality feel and easy to use. Seems to have great construction.</li>
    <li> I like it , works grant</li>
    <li> Only had it a month so far, but it does everything arazor to do. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Provides a nice clean shave.  It&#x27;s waterproof so it&#x27;s easy to clean. I would definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> Perhaps my boyfriend just has sensitive skin  . . . Or perhaps the razor takes some getting used to . . . But he find that it tugs the hairs rather than cutting them cleanly . . . And it especially irritates his neck.  He hasn&#x27; tried a lot of electric razors, so perhaps this would be the norm for him.</li>
    <li> Does everything my previous version did</li>
    <li> I am very Happy with it.</li>
    <li> cuts my beard OK but noisier than my last Norelco</li>
    <li> isn&#x27;t strong enough for a tough beard</li>
    <li> It feels like a 4 cylinder engine... week, but works, I gave a Ok. rating</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor. Great shave. Faster spin speed than lower priced model, due to higher voltage lithium-ion battery. Charges quicker, has charge indicator light, stays charged longer. Rinses out to clean. Trimmer works great too. Does not come with charger stand as pictured, just a regular charger.</li>
    <li> A well-received birthday gift.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of this model I bought.  Very satisfied with the job on my tough beard.</li>
    <li> Works well for the price...</li>
    <li> This is my second razor. Shaves very well, but my first one lasted less than a year.</li>
    <li> The shaver blades did not delivwe as I had hoped. I purchased a newer model a month later for my travel kit and like it better. No issues with the vendor.</li>
    <li> My shaves using my new Norelco are are only beat by my blade razor, but hay, no surprises here.</li>
    <li> he said it shaves great</li>
    <li> Works well enough for an electric. None will shave as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for and older model.&lt;br /&gt;Both work well, and if the time comes to replace this one I&#x27;m sure I will&lt;br /&gt;get the latest model of this design</li>
    <li> My husband thinks this is a bit bulky compared to his old one. He compared this to a &amp;#34;GMC&amp;#34; SUV and his old razor was a Lexus.&lt;br /&gt;Works well but is not able to contour to his face the way his old one could. He complains it is a bit bulky</li>
    <li> Do not buy unless you have thin girly hair</li>
    <li> It is really good. The battery can continue so long.</li>
    <li> Purchased elsewhere, but love it so far.  Leaves an amazing shave and very little burning.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave but you do have to use it for a month for best results.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet too.  I use the cordless feature.  That way I can sit and watch TV,&lt;br /&gt;listen to radio or hold a conversation and not be inhibited with a cord.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does exactly what it promises. Highly satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have had an electric razor for years and years and I have found this one the best one yet.</li>
    <li> Love love love! I bought it for my teen and we use it for shaving our legs. It saves so much time and effort...and no more cuts.</li>
    <li> Great razor, the ability to quickly flip the razors open to rinse is an excellent feature.</li>
    <li> Aweseme shaver! Real fast and accurate.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and does a very good job for the price.</li>
    <li> good product.  works as advertised</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t LOOK as nice as my old one, that I paid 4X as much for.&lt;br /&gt;But the blades are the same, and the battery better.&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s what your buying, really.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy it for looks.</li>
    <li> Gives only a fair shave</li>
    <li> Great shaver. No complaints.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with shaver.</li>
    <li> I returned it for a new head for my 4 year old sensitouch Norelco. There was no comparison.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t perform as well as I hoped  ....but im a had grader</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard so electric shavers work great for me. I love this one except that the trimmer is at a funky angle and doesn&#x27;t lock. It makes it awkward to use. Other than that, I love this shaver.</li>
    <li> Cannot efficiently shave. Usually need multiple rounds. It is reasonable for such a low-end product.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this shaver does not include the carrying case and stand that are in the photos.  The Packaging includes: Electric shaver, protective cap, power cord, cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Close, comfortable shaves.  Easy to clean. Replaced an older Norelco which had a dead battery.</li>
    <li> works great. close shave been useing one for years</li>
    <li> A very good appliance. Smooth, close shave, and--finally--a trimmer (less easy to install on a rotating head razor).</li>
    <li> Beautiful my husband loves it. Shaving is excellent included the brush for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Really useful and verstile. Very good battery life.</li>
    <li> This one is just average, little or no improvement over similar model I&#x27;ve used for about four years.</li>
    <li> Product ok but advertised picture not the same as delivered. Missing G 2 items.&lt;br /&gt;Roland</li>
    <li> i love this product it works fantastic</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as previous razors I have had.&lt;br /&gt;Works well for the cost.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product.My father like this gift.</li>
    <li> I had used Remington shavers for years &amp; years and had never been too satisfied especially with the job it did with whiskers that tend to lay flat on the side of one&#x27;s neck.  I saw my friend had a Norelco and asked him how he liked it.  He said he didn&#x27;t have a comparison because he  had never had another brand and only two or three in his entire life (he&#x27;s a very senior citizen!).  I took his statements to indicate that the Norelco must at least do an adequate job of shaving and be dependable.  I bought one and it is multi-times better than any Remington that I ever had.  I&#x27;ve used it for about two months always in the wet mode with gel shaving cream.  Clean up with running hot water is super easy and quick.</li>
    <li> Clearly superior in every way to the Remington it replaces.</li>
    <li> Lives up to its name!</li>
    <li> Present for our grandson.  He is very pleased and has only good things to say about the shaver.</li>
    <li> Nice but delivery time was late</li>
    <li> It gives a nice close shave. And  I am the one shaving my  husband.</li>
    <li> Great electric...I am a woman and I love using this for my legs...I can shave as often as I want, especially great for warm weather seasons, without having to worry about pesky ingrown hairs or razor burn! Great purchase</li>
    <li> OK, but seems to be made with less care than my old Norelco.</li>
</ol>
