      <li>Wonderful cream rinse, but you only have to use it every other time you wash your hair.  </li>
      <li>Great price compared to the salon &amp; this huge bottle will last me a long time.</li>
      <li>so my hair tends to get real grimy and frizzy quick.</li>
      <li>Hair looks shiny and soft and tangle free after using it.</li>
      <li>- it really works!  </li>
      <li>In the future, it needs to be packaged better</li>

      <li>I noticed a difference after the first use and my hair continues to improve with each use.</li>
      <li>like I just had a treatment again for the first time.</li>
      <li>but it really works!  </li>
      <li>Hair feels clean and soft with use.</li>
      <li>have very fine hair, and every other conditioner I&#x27;ve tried makes my hair very greasy.</li>
      <li>Saw this priced almost twice as much in some stores around me.</li>

      <li>I have very course hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the real thing for years</li>
      <li>My mom hair type is wavy in front and canopy and very kinky in the bottom of hair head.</li>
      <li>I was told that you CAN use this too much --</li>

      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I feel like it really helps my hair keep its soft texture</li>
      <li>mostly* the same, but not exactly.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
      <li>look like I have the hair of a fifteen year old .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also available at CVS, whereas many other brands are only available in salons and are VERY expensive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this was NOT authentic Coppola conditioner!!!  </li>
      <li>thick hair, and the previous Coppola conditioner was a great detangled as well as a deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product before and this conditioner smelled old and even had some kind of hard particles in it!!  </li>
      <li>I planned to leave it in for 20mins as a deep conditioner but had to rinse it out immediately once the reaction started and even that wasn&#x27;t fast enough!</li>
      <li>She claims no other product softens and nourishes her hair like this one.</li>
      <li>is definitely more manageable, softer, less frizzy and MUCH less damaged</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, it really makes my hair soft and it isn&#x27;t overly heavy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Much cheaper than at stores. Smells good and makes my hair look smooth and shiny. I have a keratin treatment and its the brand my hair stylist recommends.</li>
    <li> I have very course hair and this is the only shampoo that has ever add me look like I have the hair of a fifteen year old .</li>
    <li> I do my own keratin treatments at home for my daughter and I. I use this conditioner once a week to revamp my hair. I feel like it really helps my hair keep its soft texture like I just had a treatment again for the first time. I use Aubrey organics so the need to use the conditioner everyday would be a waste.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think its the real deal. Was not sealed when it came in and my hair feels dry. Not Coppola Complex. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with my hair my whole life - the Keratin treatment costs a bomb but it really works!  Have just returned from a beach holiday (wet your hair and thinly coat with conditioner before and then after rinsing off - to protect from salt or chlorine from the pool) - FANTASTIC - it really works!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I washed my hair with the Keratin Complex shampoo and conditioner once and had horrible results. I had more hair loss than usual and I was barely able to comb through it. I immediately returned it. STAY AWAY</li>
    <li> I get Keratin treatments done to my hair, and after those, you can only use special shampoos/conditioners that do not contain any sulfates or sodium chloride. I have tried a variety of these types of shampoos/conditioners, and I think this is the best by far. It makes my hair feel so soft. It&#x27;s also available at CVS, whereas many other brands are only available in salons and are VERY expensive. Ordering a huge bottle on Amazon saves me money too, and I love that the huge bottles come with a pump, so you don&#x27;t have to pick up the bottle every time.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE this stuff! I noticed a difference after the first use and my hair continues to improve with each use. I was told that you CAN use this too much -- so I limit my use to every 2nd or 3rd shampoo and my hair is definitely more manageable, softer, less frizzy and MUCH less damaged looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this product once I&#x27;ve used this bottle up for SURE! GREAT, GREAT stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have the Keratin Straightening Treatment done regularly and my stylist uses this product line - so it is what is recommended for maintenance. It works great and the prices on Amazon are the best around!</li>
    <li> Love these products! Great hair with shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels and it was nicely wrapped and shipped.  The bottle is perfect size.  It will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF I RECEIVE WHAT I PAY FOR OR I RECEIVED AN IMITATION. I WILL NEVER KNOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE: I&#x27;m pretty sure this was NOT authentic Coppola conditioner!!!  I&#x27;ve used the real thing for years but THIS bottle triggered an allergic reaction!  I&#x27;m talking swollen, red, itchy ears, then neck, face, and chest! I planned to leave it in for 20mins as a deep conditioner but had to rinse it out immediately once the reaction started and even that wasn&#x27;t fast enough! Be careful!</li>
    <li> So I decided to search and see if I could find this cheaper than buying it at the salon.  I purchased this before I had the actual treatment so that I could have it by the end of my 3 day waiting period after the treatment.  I received it on the day before I was able to wash my hair so I was greatly relieved to not have to wait any longer.  It is doing a great job so far so I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this conditioner!  I tried all other products for colored hair and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Keratin Complex shampoo for some time now and I love it.  I just decided to try the conditioner.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those guilty of thinking all shampoo &amp; conditioners are created equal. Last year I heard about the keratin treatment by capolla and decided to try it out. I also purchased the conditioner &amp; shampoo. BOY did it make a difference with my hair. Even though I havent been using the keratin treatment itself lately this shampoo &amp; conditioner makes washing &amp; straightening my hair soooo much easier. I&#x27;m african american and I work out alot so my hair tends to get real grimy and frizzy quick. But since I started using the keratin complex products I no longer dread washing/blow drying my hair. I did make the mistake of trying a different shampoo but still using the conditioner and quickly found out that YES it does make a difference.</li>
    <li> The conditioner itself gets 5 starts. have very fine hair, and every other conditioner I&#x27;ve tried makes my hair very greasy. This doesn&#x27;t, my hair feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, the bottle I received was not what was ordered. I received a blue bottle that didn&#x27;t have the brand name &amp;#34;Coppola&amp;#34; anywhere on the bottle. The ingredients list was *mostly* the same, but not exactly. This seems to be a common problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent the bottle back and purchased at CVS. I will avoid purchasing online again.</li>
    <li> Great economy size, seller provides nice service and product. Having extreme curly hair.....this product cuts down on frizz and styling time. Go for it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve usede this for years with excellent results;  leave my hair solt and manageable; using it makes a big difference</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and this conditioner smelled old and even had some kind of hard particles in it!!  I think it may have been stored for a while!</li>
    <li> This conditioner gave me a dry scalp and residue was left on my scalp and in my hair, no matter how long i would rinse for or if i would comb my hair in the shower during rinsing process.</li>
    <li> this is a great value for the product, and it is lasting me forever! leaves my hair very smooth. thank you so much for the fast delivery and good packaging!</li>
    <li> Very good! Would recommend the product again! Definitely a great product! In the future, it needs to be packaged better</li>
    <li> Very good conditioner. Smooth and silky. Hair looks shiny and soft and tangle free after using it.Great after using brazilian keratin treatment. Copolla shampoo and conditioner are much better then the QOD ones.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd purchase for my wife&#x27;s use. She claims no other product softens and nourishes her hair like this one.</li>
    <li> Hi there I just wanted to say how happy my daughter is with this product since she has a very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;A lot a trouble to get it done, but with the shampoo, and the conditioner things are easy.</li>
    <li> This is product is the best of chemically straighten hair.&lt;br /&gt;It provides the needed maintenance. My mom&#x27;s hair never looked this long and shiny before. My mom hair type is wavy in front and canopy and very kinky in the bottom of hair head.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell. Hair feels clean and soft with use. Easy to detangle hair after the use, works well with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as the wife was tired of driving a ways to get this from a salon.  The price here after shipping was way cheaper than going to the salon.  The product shipped quickly and arrived in great shape.</li>
    <li> I was a fan of Coppola Keratin conditioner for years, but something was amiss with this one.  The bottle was completely different, and so was the product.  I have very long, thick hair, and the previous Coppola conditioner was a great detangled as well as a deep conditioner.  This bottle, however, is much different - did not detangle like the others, and did not condition as deeply.  It&#x27;s no longer my go-to product and I will save it for my kids or for shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this keratin conditioner. Great price compared to the salon &amp; this huge bottle will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner on the market. The end. HA HA&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it really makes my hair soft and it isn&#x27;t overly heavy. Great product.</li>
    <li> Please see the extensive proof cited below about how this company has knowingly put customers at risk.  The first link describes hundreds of cases of healthy women going bald after using the Coppola products. Please do not purchase Coppola product until you at least look at this link.

    <li> It is a good product to use for your hair. My hair is coarse and thick. It helps soften my hair.</li>
    <li> Saw this priced almost twice as much in some stores around me. Great product, but a great buy now too!</li>
    <li> The one I had receive has deferent design .. I like it .. It is good to my hair ..</li>
    <li> Great for extending a keratin conditioning treatment! Hair stays silky longer.</li>
    <li> I use this with the keratin shampoo after I got a keratin on my hair.  Wonderful cream rinse, but you only have to use it every other time you wash your hair.  Great scent.</li>
