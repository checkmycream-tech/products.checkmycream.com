<li> Color is great, but nail polish is a little thick and clumpy...</li>
<li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts...</li>
<li> It stays on well and doesn&#x27;t seem to chip like other brands.</li>
<li> Staying power is less than my other OPI polishes.  </li>
<li> Does not go on like other OPI Polishes...not sure it is not old as it separates when applied and is thick; I am very disappointed</li>
<li> I wasted my money on this polish.</li>
<li> usually lasts less than a day.</li>
<li> Sort of mad</li>
<li> Disappointed that the color was not as shown but that&#x27;ll teach me to buy online instead of in person.</li>
<li> The consistency is on thicker side so if you&#x27;ve been disappointed by runny coral shades, this one is fully opaque in 2 coats.  </li>
