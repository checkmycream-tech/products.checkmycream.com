<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very moist,so I like it.</li>
    <li> Nice kit, great price. Bought a bunch for gifts.</li>
    <li> Box was all crushed up when it arrived :(</li>
    <li> it is ok as i expected</li>
    <li> Nice kit. Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. Target has these sets for good prices check them first but I do recommend this item.</li>
    <li> The product sizes are not the same size as pictured.  For example the deep cleansing cream is pictured as 6 oz.  What you get is a 0.75 oz tube.  You get much smaller products than the ones pictured.  I guess you have to read the description instead of looking at the picture.</li>
    <li> I have used many of the products. Most of them have been wonderful(the lip balm, deep facial cleanser, and body moisturizer. I although did not like at all the foot lotion. Very sticky as honey and needless to say very messy.</li>
    <li> The lipchap is pepper mint  and very minty and burns a bit, the creams are nice and very lovely smell</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great gift set.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for use.But I think it smells too strong.</li>
    <li> I Like It is VERY Cute But all the things inside are tiny all mini!! not worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees products before but wanted some more products at a better price. I found this online and had to have it. I like all the scents, love the ingredients and think this kit is absolutely wonderful for traveling.</li>
    <li> I have bought similar gift sets for women in my life and have heard nothing but praise for Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products.  My mother (one of the aforementioned women) has asked me where she can get these products.  This is a woman who was once a model and cares very much about what she puts on her skin.  I&#x27;d recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees without hesitation.</li>
    <li> As i have not used it ,it is very good!</li>
    <li> Wife considers it low quality.</li>
    <li> Love this kit and just about everything Burt&#x27;s makes. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and it made the person smile.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get tricked, these are travel size only not full size, which is not clearly describe. Therefore, it is not a good deal.</li>
    <li> Great way to check out if you like a product before for spending money on a full sized bottle or tube. In this way the products were very reasonably priced. I did not care for any of the products.</li>
    <li> great product for the money.</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVE this set of Burt&#x27;s Bees!&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees always has such cute packages during the holiday season. Each product on this set&lt;br /&gt;is useable &amp; definitely effective.&lt;br /&gt;I got a few of these sets to give out to friends &amp; family for Christmas, + one for myself!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend the set, its excellent essentials!</li>
    <li> Great variety of products, perfect for gifts</li>
    <li> l LIKE IT . It &#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer idea, for someone you just dont know that well.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I like it very much!</li>
    <li> wife loved this little package of Burt&#x27;s bees, she love the brand.</li>
    <li> this product(s) are all great and they all are very moisturizing I gave theses products as a gift and she loved them I would buy these product(s) again in the future.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it. Great mix of things</li>
    <li> Sent as a gift to my sister.  She says she loves it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good I like this</li>
    <li> cute set as a stocking stuffer. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin, bad hands.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this and shipped it to my sister at college. She loved it. I would recommend this. :)</li>
    <li> Easy and affordable Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Great set but the box came somewhat damaged.</li>
    <li> I never knew why Burt&#x27;s Bees is considered \\&quot;the s***\\&quot;. This kit speaks for itself.    Although i find it a bit overpriced, most of these items cost 2+ regardless. The chapstick itself is around 2.37 at my Walmart. That being said, I believe its cheaper to get this than to get them separately.    I have yet to try all the items.    The chapstick is one of the staples of Burt&#x27;s Bees for a reason. I find it to be a little too waxy for my preference. As a male i find that my favorite chapstick brand is actually softlips, with spf 15. I would rate Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm 3.5/5.    I originally purchased this because of the foot cream. My girlfriend loves foot massages so i was automatically sold. Like some had said, this cream is pretty greasy. Foot massages are usually given in the evening or before bed, so It wasn&#x27;t too much of an issue. The odor is strong! So it would mask a mild foot odor, which is common after a long day in the socks &amp; shoes. I&#x27;d also rate this a 3.5/5.    To be continued...</li>
    <li> nice assortment of lotions.</li>
    <li> If someone you know geeks over Burt&#x27;s Bees, get them this and earn a few points.  It is also a nice sampler to get an idea of what they are about.  I&#x27;m happy with about 60% of this set, so 3 stars is pretty fair.  I&#x27;m not sure what the cleansing cream is, or when you need to use salve, but everything else is great.  The foot creme has to be the star of the show though.  A massage with this could help you realize true love.  Thanks Burt!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Got this as part of a &amp;#34;one-day&amp;#34; sale and it&#x27;s a great travel kit. Love the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> very good, i like it very much~</li>
    <li> The perfect small gift for a co-worker. If it is for a parent or loved one, you may need to buy another gift to go along with it, maybe buy an additional Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Kit!?</li>
    <li> Wife loved it a whole lot cheaper here than a retailer.</li>
    <li> Part of a bridal shower gift and the bride was clearly pleased.  Who doesn&#x27;t love Burt&#x27;s Bees?</li>
    <li> Very good stuff. This is a small package as you can see by the volumes of each product and judge by the price of the set. The ingredients are all natural and quality products. This makes a great gift for someone. I have used all of these products individually in the past and love them. Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s chapstick is absolutely the only kind I will use. It&#x27;s the only one that actually fixes the problem instead of just feeling good until it wears off.</li>
    <li> At about $9 or $10, I was very pleased with this set. I purchased it as a gift for someone.</li>
    <li> Love burts bees usually, but this seemed old to me. Lotions smelled bad, everything smelled bad for that matter...couldn&#x27;t find a date on it but definitely would not re purchase sorry</li>
    <li> Creamy, chap stick is a little drying.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. They are gifts to my sister and she likes them.</li>
    <li> Brand new, awesome smelling, glad I went through amazon!</li>
    <li> love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm</li>
    <li> All these products in this kit are top notch! They are sample size and small, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good buy. We give these as gifts to teachers and friends and everyone loves them.</li>
    <li> My grandmother bought me this as an early Christmas gift. I used every single product at one time, so imagine my delight when I found out that I am, in fact, allergic to bees wax. I was itching and burning for a good 2 hours and have not dared to touch the box. It sits on the bathroom counter mocking me. Please, for the love of your skin, do a patch-test before using copious quantities of this product.</li>
    <li> awesome gift for anyone that is a burt&#x27;s bees fan. excellent price for an excellent product that is sometimes hard to find.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who believes in good natural things.  She used it, called me and said, Mom I love this. It goes on smooth and leaves no greasy feeling.  I absorbs quickly.  She uses hand lotion all the time....Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great little gift set for a great price. I gave it as part of a gift to a friend and she loved it</li>
    <li> Love! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It makes the skin feel like its on vacation.</li>
    <li> really liked the lip balm so tried other items with this kit. wish it had a better smell to it.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day, and she loved it. They all smell really nice; well except for the hand salve and the lip balm, which has no scent; and the foot cream works really well. If you&#x27;re new to Burt&#x27;s Bees, it&#x27;s a nice kit to start with. I would reccomend.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the facial wash- didn&#x27;t feel special in any way. The hand salve stinks going on but leaves your hands soft without a lingering smell. The body lotion isn&#x27;t fantastic- probably not worth the full-size price. The lip balm is amazing and I&#x27;ll probably put one in every bag I own and in every room of my house. I love the coconut foot lotion- it&#x27;s moisturizing and has helped soften my dry, cracked feet.</li>
    <li> I love burt bees..especially when it&#x27;s this Price :) I got it for a valentines gift. You get a little bit of every thing some chap stick lip Baum, lotion, foot cream ect...</li>
    <li> love this product. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff is a little more expensive then what I normally buy, so it was great to get a pack of small items to try before I spend a lot on the full size products. I liked everything in the pack especially the coconut foot cream! Plus it was delivered very quickly!</li>
    <li> Great! I chose the Gift-wrap this item and/or Include a free personalized gift message option and it was perfect! Everything came nice and carefully packaged. Excellent service from Amazon, getting people together even when they are far </li>
    <li> Love the lip balm.  It has a tingling sensation that is great for chapped lips.</li>
    <li> I love it! Why it cannot be shipped overseas now?</li>
    <li> very nice pack and good product</li>
    <li> I will not use any thing else.</li>
    <li> I loved it. I even bought the bigger size milk &amp; honey hand cream.</li>
    <li> Neat kit, wish I&#x27;d bought more at that price.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are the best!</li>
    <li> This was our first experience with the burt&#x27;s bees brand. My wife was very impressed and is looking forward to ordering more.</li>
    <li> Bought for my boyfriend to keep in his gym bag, perfect for it!</li>
    <li> We happened on Burt&#x27;s Bees by accident when we went to buy more we thought it was a bit too pricey at Wal-Mart so we when I found this kit on here I snatched it up.  The little travel sizes allowed me to sample a lot more of their products.  We still love them all they restore moisture to dry hands and feet.  Great for dry arid climates or the winter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine product. No problems.</li>
    <li> good quality and nice package and decent smell but nothing special; I expected more since everyone loves this product but did not meet that expectation.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 kits and gave them as gifts. So far, they are much loved by my friends who received it.</li>
    <li> I received an Amazon gift card and spent some of it on this kit.  I had used the lip balm and some of the other products before, but had never tried the face wash.  I love it! It&#x27;s fun to treat yourself and find something new that you might not have tried otherwise.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s bees in a well known and trusted company, this is a perfect gift for secret santa. Even if they already have one, you can&#x27;t have too many.</li>
    <li> Makes a great small gift to put with a gift card. I wish it was bigger, but its a great set of samples. I love Burts Bees products.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products are very good. The only down side is their price.</li>
    <li> It is very small. Look at the amounts of each. I also didn&#x27;t really pay attention to how the lotions and things were the same size as the chapstick...</li>
    <li> I bought this as a way to try a bunch of different Burt&#x27;s Bees products without spending big bucks on something I may not like. Out of all the products included, the Milk and Honey Body Lotion is absolutely to die for! It smells so good and absorbs into your skin quickly without leaving a greasy feel. I&#x27;ve used almost all of the trial size bottle and will be purchasing a big bottle soon. The Soap Bark and Chamomile lotion is good but I don&#x27;t like the smell as much. The hand salve is great on really dry skin. I used it on my face when I was sick and drying out my skin from constant nose blowing. It worked very well to replenish moisture to my nose and face. The lip balm is very minty, which I&#x27;m not a huge fan of, but it works very well so I use it. If you like mint, you&#x27;ll love it. I haven&#x27;t used the foot lotion so I can&#x27;t comment on it, but it does smell very good. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to try Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> This was a small gift for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day, and she loved it. She&#x27;s always liked Burt&#x27;s Bees products and she used up everything in the gift set. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Delivery was prompt, which was essential since this was a Christmas present.  The person I gave the gift too enjoyed it and I would purchase it again as I have in the past.</li>
    <li> What a sweet and nice collection. Good quality product with a nice cross section of products.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and actually about this for my mom for Christmas. I was happy that she liked it, but was a little sad I hadn&#x27;t bought one for myself! :)</li>
    <li> Heard so much about how great a product they are, but was totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly as is in the description. Perfect for everyday use. Just enough to last well over one month. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Well, my wife loves it. Great product.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend of mine.  She always got dry hands so bad in the winter that her skin would split.  This is the only thing we have found to actually resolve that issue.  It may only be one of these items that does the trick, but it works.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend&#x27;s wedding shower and she loved them, it was the center piece in the de-stress kit I made for her upcomming marriage lol. She used it all in about 2 months and bought more to boot!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 17 year old.  She has always been one for liking Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  She couldn&#x27;t be any happier when she has their products for use.  After all, they are all natural.  It has been money well spent.</li>
    <li> Gotta love Burt&#x27;s Bees!  This would be a great stocking stuffer for a sister, or a teenager, or to give out as a teacher gift.  Or treat yourself (that&#x27;s important, too)!</li>
    <li> I bought them as gifts for my friends, they are well packaged and seems newly manufactured. I hope my friends will like them.</li>
    <li> Great introduction to the Burt&#x27;s Bees products and gives you pretty much everything you need. The honey lotion smells absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought these to put in large mason jars for Mother&#x27;s Day gifts my Grandkids could give their Mothers.  They were so cute!</li>
    <li> From the picture, the box looks bigger than it is..  That&#x27;s my only complaint.  Other than that, it makes a great small gift.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Burt&#x27;s Bees Kit to give to my Pastor for Christmas. How can you go wrong with this? I&#x27;m 100% sure she will love it and use it.</li>
    <li> Expected these to be way bigger. I want to say the packaging is a tad bit bigger than a dvd case. Bough this for my girlfriend but just wanted a little try. I used the hand salve a hit and it made my fingers really smooth, everything in here smells really nice and I personally use a couple of Burt&#x27;s products on myself and have never had a complaint. Love the company and great products. I would say this is a sample pack size. Good as a stocking stuffer or extra gift to throw in at a birthday or something. Sure my girlfriend will love all these.</li>
    <li> I love this product line and highly recommend.  The beauty kit is great for covering lips to hand, or feet.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for gifts for a wedding shower and they were a big hit, would buy more!!!</li>
    <li> this kit has everything you need to be your best.... burts bees is  the very best you can buy, my family love it.</li>
    <li> My wife is a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. She has sensitive skin and finds every product she has used by Burt&#x27;s to be gentle. She has never had a adverse reaction even with everyday use. I bought this kit as a stocking stuffer that she can add it to her travel bag.</li>
    <li> Was a gift. I would have liked it myself and definitely thought about that. She loved it. She is a mother and needs to pamper herself once in awhile. Good for any woman or girl.</li>
    <li> I just decided to give to my friends as a gift. it looks pretty nice though. I am glad that I&#x27;ve bought this one from burt&#x27;s bee for present.</li>
    <li> cute gift set, I bought these as a gift. Nice packaging and good variety of samples</li>
    <li> my wife orders stuff like this for her skin and other uses for her body. Not sure what else she does with it</li>
    <li> Facial cleanser is so refreshing (according to my wife). All good!</li>
    <li> great items, good gifts for my friends</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes some great, simple, old-school products, and this sample pack is a great value.  Ask any set of chapped lips if they&#x27;d like a little Burt&#x27;s Bees; you&#x27;ll very likely hear a &#x27;yes&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I gave the lip balm to my mom, which I had planned on doing all along. But then I also gave the foot cream to a friend because when I put it on, the feeling of it on my skin was horrible! It felt greasy and dry all at the same time. However, I do like the hand salve in the little tin, so I kept that and use it sometimes. Overall, I&#x27;m not happy, and wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> My bridesmaids loved them. I had to get one for each of them along with the other stuff I put into bags so they wouldn&#x27;t fight.</li>
    <li> Superb products for travel situations only. Keep in mind that there are trial size only not the full product size.</li>
    <li> THis little kit is a perfect gift or if you&#x27;re going on a trip. Is a good way to try all of the products i use. I really like using natural products without petroleum products.</li>
    <li> Works good but is too small and overpriced. Not worth it. better off getting little items at target. waste of money to ship it.</li>
    <li> I like the products in this kit. I love the peppermint lip balm.</li>
    <li> The size was bigger than I expected. Mom liked them.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom for Mother&#x27;s day, and she loves it. We&#x27;re already huge fans of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but she likes the small lotions to keep in her purse and what not.</li>
    <li> Good price! Used it for baby shower prize!</li>
    <li> Nice combo for people with dry skin problems. The hand salve is a little smelly for my taste but works great.</li>
    <li> My sister had not tried burt&#x27;s bees products before and this was a great way for her to experience many products without breaking her wallet before she could figure out which ones she liked.</li>
    <li> Another perfect gift giving idea from Burt&#x27;s Bees. The sizes are just right to be able to throw in your handbag to carry with you all the time or to put with the rest of your beauty items. This is a perfect gift for anyone who loves natural products.</li>
    <li> He loves Burts Bee&#x27;s product&#x27;s. He was very appreciative and other fella&#x27;s were asking if his Mom would send them some too. Ya Right!! I will be getting this again for both of my boy&#x27;s.Thank You Amazon!!</li>
    <li> very good!  I want it next.</li>
    <li> Burts Bees products are always nice to have.  This was a present for my granddaughter living in France.  A difficult product for her to get there, so I sent this to her to make her feel more at home.</li>
    <li> I had been familiar with the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand and this set does not disappoint. I bought these as gifts and one for myself and everyone has been talking about how great it feels on the skin and how well it is working. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great gift item, perfect for holiday giving, birthday or as a thank you gift</li>
    <li> I had heard this product was great. Now I know first hand that everything was the truth. THANKS!!!! I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 sets.</li>
    <li> I brought this as a gift, my friend loves it very much !</li>
    <li> thanks for a great product very pleased good service</li>
    <li> Love it, great gifts! Who doesn&#x27;t love some Burt&#x27;s bee!! Good price!</li>
    <li> love it, everything works nicely</li>
    <li> I like the fact that a little bit of everything comes in this kit. I purchased it as a gift for a teenager and she just loved it. I have tried Burts bees brand before and I really like the way it makes my skin look and feel. I would recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> Very nice as a small gift, or to try the products&lt;br /&gt;included.</li>
    <li> Very cute little set of products, perfect as a gift or prize for the baby shower games we played. Great price too!</li>
    <li> As advertised. Burt&#x27;s bees is a favorite.</li>
    <li> The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
    <li> Great gift set at a great price. Made a perfect stocking stuffer. Great quality as well!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> love burts bees and a great price</li>
    <li> very good,my son like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, so I can&#x27;t comment on the actual product quality.  However, as a gift, it was a good deal and really nice.  It is packaged well, in a way that shows off the contents.  I expected the items included to be smaller-sized (quantities) than they are; they&#x27;re really pretty decent and would be excellent for travel, carrying in a purse, or tucking in a desk or bedside table-- they&#x27;re not just miniatures that aren&#x27;t really good for anything.  The sizes are practical.  The items included are a nice selection of things that an average person would use, not &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; choices that might not appeal to everybody.  There are no scents or colors/tints to worry about, so it&#x27;s a pretty safe bet.  If you wanted to pick up a gift to stash at home and have on hand for an emergency, this wouldn&#x27;t be a bad choice at all.</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees.  The kit is perfect for summer beach trips</li>
    <li> nice travel size and works for small gift for someone who doesn&#x27;t need a thing</li>
    <li> I loved being able to try these products and decided what i really liked. The size of the bottles are not super small, i have used them over and over for almost a month.  The kit is also very well priced. In the stores, the lip balm itself is at least a few dollars. This is a great way to try products with out spending a lot of money. I love the face wash, and the body lotion. not extremely happy with the hand cream, or the foot lotion. I like the cuticle cream much better (which isn&#x27;t in this kit) all of the products have a wonderful scent, and I don&#x27;t feel like I am using products with a lot of chemical smell in them. This kit is also fun as to order as a gift. (i bought it for me) I am sure someone (male or female) would love to receive it.&lt;br /&gt; I just wish it came with a zipper bag or something to keep the bottles in, the packaging wasn&#x27;t worth much.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I thought but should have read the volume descriptions.</li>
    <li> This item is convenient, but too small.</li>
    <li> got this for christmas gifts. everyone loved it</li>
    <li> Is useful and smell very sweet.</li>
    <li> You know how in \\&quot;Honey I Shrunk the Kids\\&quot; the husband shrinks the kids? Well image him doing that to the Burt&#x27;s Bees because it is A LOT smaller than what is picture and not at all what I had imagined.</li>
    <li> This kit came with a product for all sorts of uses.  I bought it for my wife because she has really dry and cracked hands and it has helped immensely.  I have even found myself using some of the products.  I am a diabetic and have trouble with dry and cracked feet.  This kit comes with a coconut foot lotion that has worked wonders to help repair my feet when nothing else worked.  Its a little greasy at first, but if you let it dry for a few minutes it stick.  This is an awesome product, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I needed an in- expensive gift for Christmas, when it arrived I was very pleased what a bargain I had.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the product as always. Mainly bought it for the two items I really needed on short notice and didn&#x27;t want to shell out extra money on the shipping since I have Prime.</li>
    <li> Great quality but too little product for the price</li>
    <li> It burns! I hated it and I&#x27;m glad I ordered this gift set to test out the products. I won&#x27;t be ordering them again!</li>
    <li> Good deal for high quality Burt&#x27;s Bee products.  Prompt delivery.  Got them for a work party, and most of the men took it home to give to their wives...so probably better for women then men.</li>
    <li> Bought a couple for stocking stuffers and one for myself. I had only used the lip balm before, which I like, and wanted to try their other products. I&#x27;m defiantly going to buy more and the kit I bought is great for my purse.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as Christmas gifts, but I am sure that they will love them. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and thought these would make great gifts and the price was much better than Wal-Mart or Target. The package is a little smaller then what I was expecting, but I would be happy to get something like this.</li>
    <li> I bought these as prizes for baby shower games and everyone just loved them....they are really nice sets!</li>
    <li> Friend loved this gift</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bess products have been a good purchase for me in the past, so I felt comfortable purchasing them again from Amazon.com.  I should have paid more attention though because this purchase did not come with a carry bag which I thought  it did.  Next time I&#x27;ll be more careful.</li>
    <li> i just try the lip balm &amp; didn&#x27;t like the smell &amp; taste is very strong like vicks</li>
    <li> Great products!  I recently purchased for my daughter and now she is hooked on the products as well.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent stocking stuffer for my girlfriend and she loved it! Tried some of the lotion, makes the hands feel very good.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is the shiz-nit! I love this stuff. If you&#x27;ve never experienced the soothing feeling of Unlcle Burt on your lips... it&#x27;s time to try!</li>
    <li> This product was shipped quickly and was what it was suppose to be - it is a great product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this kit is all travel sized stuff. Not sure if I just over looked that info or what but just so everyone knows.</li>
    <li> Nice cute. Got for a teachers gift during the holidays</li>
    <li> I love the foot cream so much had to get a bigger tube, it really has helped my dry feet.</li>
    <li> Burts  Bee products are the best, like the lip balm better that anything else I have used. Rest in peace Burt, your products will be used for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s  Bees products.  This set is great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected however it made a great gift</li>
    <li> Very nice assortment of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> Perfect mini trial of products, I received this for Christmas and was extremely happy to discover a couple of new things!</li>
    <li> Great value for burrs bees products I normally spend almost this on just the lib balm. Thank you Amazon for connecting me with such a great deal. I love Burt bees! The great deal made me love it even more! Defiantly will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for each of my daughters for Christmas.  They love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and always get a lot of use out of them.  This was no exception.</li>
    <li> Love it! It was a little pricey for the size of it all, but Burts Bees usually is.</li>
    <li> Most people really like Burt&#x27;s Bees and to give this along side a gift card is my favorite &amp;#34;not sure what they would like&amp;#34; gift. I got this for my recently new boyfriends mom and I really like it. Personally, I would love this gift. It&#x27;s simple, adds variety and is super cheap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift, but want one for myself! This is a great starter kit for anyone who wants to try Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend. All the products here are sample sized (except the lip balm) but I think they are good to give as a present. I received a burts bees packet like these, though they are regular sized and I loved it!</li>
    <li> travel sizes good gift</li>
    <li> I love Burts Bees and this online deal was way cheaper than the prices at stores so I am glad that I found this deal.</li>
    <li> Recomended. Excellent products. It is a very cute kit, very nice design. Thanks a lot guys. Highly recomended, thanks. Hope you like it too.</li>
    <li> GREAT gift! Inexpensive and looks really nice.</li>
    <li> You get a little bit of everything for such a great price. It comes in a nice size box, not too big or small.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Package is very affordable, packed solid, there are 5 things, the production date is 2013. For more than 140 days, 240 days and so on, should be fresh</li>
    <li> Natural, comfortable.</li>
    <li> Nice little gift. Gave it to my Granddaughter and she loved it.</li>
    <li> A perfect Christmas gift for daughter-in-law.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Made for the perfect christmas gift</li>
    <li> Bought it for a colleague but wanted to keep the gift low key, small but thoughtful and she seemed to appreciate it.</li>
    <li> It is a good gift set.</li>
    <li> like it especially in winter</li>
    <li> It served as a good gift for my best friends Bumble Bee Baby Shower theme</li>
    <li> Great last minute gift</li>
    <li> the product is fine but the size is very small, it seems like a trial size, guess I should of paid closed attention to the picture.</li>
    <li> Perfect way to find which Burts Bees products you&#x27;ll love. I love them all except the cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup. I&#x27;m in love with the foot cream.</li>
    <li> Burts Bees makes some great products. Its all natural and a bargain for what you get. I would highly recommend this set as a gift or a combo buy for product to use everyday. Only con is the package is pretty small, all products are purse/travel size.</li>
    <li> It is cheap and I like it.I can bring it when I go to travel because it is small and convenient.</li>
    <li> I gave this kit to my girlfriend as a gift. She is very pleased with every item in the kit. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a little pricey for the small containers.  I thought the containers would have been bigger.  I&#x27;m sure the product is good because I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees before and really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> They usually have a sale every year and I get my wife this or a similar kit.</li>
    <li> This was a great kit.&lt;br /&gt;Yes they are travel size products but for 10 dollars its worth it plus burts bee is a great company so i do recommend this for someone that wants to try burts bees products for the first time or just anybody .</li>
    <li> This is a perfect shopping</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter at Christmas and she loves everything in it.  Nice, small sizes to try to see if you like them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as small gifts for some ladies in my life.  They all said that they loved using Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d read the description closer because I saw the picture that specifically says 6 and 4 oz. wrong. Good news is that these can go through airport security.</li>
    <li> What is not to love.  Presents for my girls.  Everything came as promised and everything was sealed.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> Yes this is small but a great way to show someone you&#x27;re thinking of them. Quality product and packaging for a great price.</li>
    <li> Appealing packaging with nice presentation. Perfect for the last minute gift or stocking stuffer. Nice assortment of package contents as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotions!!  I really love that these products are all natural, even though this is a small gift set, it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are always a good quality. The small sample sizes are great for stuffing a stocking. A Christmas crowd pleaser.</li>
    <li> Picture is very misleading. Items are tiny - not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very great products for a great value! I would absolutely buy this again. Wait for the sale on it though.</li>
    <li> Gave it to Mom for Mother&#x27;s day and she likes it. I dont like the price - this entire package was $10, which would be fine if there was more quantity. I guess this is quality stuff and you gotta pay for quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent beauty kit. My wife loved it especially the lip balm.</li>
    <li> very nice,I like it very much.I&#x27;d like to buy it angie!</li>
    <li> the price is very cheap, very worth buying</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t pay too much for value products!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the chapstick! It glides smooth! Can&#x27;t beat coconut either! Loveeee it!</li>
    <li> This made a great Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my wife for Christmas after we saw a similar product (at a much higher price) while shopping.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Smaller than than what was expected, but every thing is great</li>
    <li> For my child,feels good</li>
    <li> The teacher loved it.</li>
    <li> This is smaller than I expected and the items inside are more like sample size, but it&#x27;s a nice gift and looks good.</li>
    <li> this kit was older than me i got it for my mother for christmas last year and i was very unsatisfied</li>
    <li> The package is a bit old. It is not good to give as a Christmas gift. I need to repackage it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, my mother loved it. Arrived safe and sound (and early :D)</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Burts Bees? A great kit with all the basics for a nice price</li>
    <li> Gave my sister this for a small Christmas gift. She loved it and so did I. I think I used more of it than she did, oops.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes great products and this kit is a solid little sampler of what they offer.</li>
    <li> Everything that would be expected from Burts. Smells great and is not irritating to the skin. I will buy another from amazon when it all runs out.</li>
    <li> I keep seeing complaints about how it&#x27;s travel size, but it doesn&#x27;t take alot. It&#x27;ll last a while. This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really nourishing to my hands, especially after doing dishes and laundry all day.</li>
    <li> Just received my Burt&#x27;s Bees shipment and I did not receive 6 oz. products as they showed in the photo so was extremely disappointed. I feel like I was deliberately tricked. Will never buy this product from you again.  I could have bought it locally but thought I was getting a good deal.  Shame on you.</li>
    <li> All good, except the foot cream, very sticky!!!</li>
    <li> I would so get this again! Its great.(:</li>
    <li> A little bit of everything to try.  I love everything in this kit.  These products are amazing!  The price on Amazon was also very good.</li>
    <li> Very good!!!! very good I love it. it works as good as i expected. impressive. I will come back again</li>
    <li> Great value for testing out which burts bees products work for you. I absolutely love the milk and honey lotion. I purchases a large bottle but keep the one from the kit in my purse.</li>
    <li> I know little about burts bees, but I do know this kit put a nice big smile on her face.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift at my shower.. and it was very nice. everyone loved them, would def.  buy again</li>
    <li> always a good product</li>
    <li> Really unimpressive, barely ok. The tubes were small, as expected, but I did not expect them to be also filled up only partially, there is nothing but air  at the top 3rd (you can notice this if you hold the tubes up to a bright light, which I accidentally noticed by setting the kit on an end table that had a bright lamp bulb illuminating the tubes). The foot &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; feels more like a sticky honey, but once you work it into your feet and put socks on overnight, it does make your feet feel smoother by the morning. The hand salve smells nice, but does not bring much hydration to the hands, my hands still felt pretty dry after applying this product a couple times. Same could be said for the hand cream, not much mending of my chapped skin on my hands even after re-applying the hand cream 2-3 times. Also, the hand cream has an unpleasant sweet vanilla smell, something that I personally don&#x27;t care for. I haven&#x27;t tried the chamomile face wash yet, hopefully it has a better smell than the hand cream. And I haven&#x27;t tried the chap-stick either, but I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees chap-sticks before and they are fine. All-in-all, I would not order this item again.</li>
    <li> Great little gift set that is perfect for travel or your purse. I&#x27;ve tried all of the products before with the exception of the coconut foot cream. I usually buy the peppermint foot cream. I must say that I do prefer the coconut foot foot cream. It&#x27;s super hydrating without the burning sensation-- perfect for dry winter feet. I still like the peppermint foot cream for foot massages (I pay my daughter $1 per foot for the pleasure of a foot rub!), but I prefer the coconut foot cream for overnight deep hydration as the burning from the peppermint sometimes makes it difficult for me to fall asleep! Anyways, this is a great little set.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift this year that was given to my mother &amp; she really enjoyed it. Although, I do have to say that the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm was a little strong on her lips. On some cases it burned her lips, but overall everything else came out just fine. Shipping was fast &amp; easy. I recommend this to anyone to use as an add-on gift or a last minute gift. A satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my grandaughter</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as described. Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this made a sweet little &amp;#34;take care of yourself&amp;#34; gift.</li>
    <li> Gifts for my relatives, looks  nice</li>
    <li> Love this product. Will go without chocolate for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just going to go through item by item-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapstick- glides on smoothly, not greasy, leaves your lips a little minty feeling- kind of tingly. Lasts a while, I would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Facial cleanser- absolutely amazing. It smells... clean? Kind of a bit like an herb... its just freshly scented. Doesn&#x27;t foam (natural things shouldn&#x27;t) cleans face nicely and also leave a bit of tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hand salve- I don&#x27;t really like this personally. I don&#x27;t see it healing my hands any better than a good thick balm-y moisturizer and it also leaves them extremely greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;foot cream- this is great but purely for nighttime. It will leave your feet VERY greasy, but just cover them with socks and go to bed- you&#x27;re golden. It does soften after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;daily moisturizer- this isn&#x27;t much better than any light moisturizer, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it also smells light and nice.</li>
    <li> The hand cream is very well</li>
    <li> i love most products from bursts bees so i enjoy it all love this for Christmas presents i enjoy it</li>
    <li> I gave these as gifts and everyone loved them. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good gift at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Bought for the significant other since she liked to use BB products. She was ecstatic. Mission accomplished! Might buy a set for myself too.</li>
    <li> Its burts bees come on! It is a great natural product that I gave as a gift. I buy the big things in store so when I saw this I was like &amp;#34;AH&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I use them everyday. I recommend them as a small gift for someone! Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know the sizes were so small, but other than that the product is fine! I gave all but the lip balm to my mother as a gift and she loved it :)</li>
    <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than in stores. Perfect baby short prize gift. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little kit. Purchased it for my wife as a Christmas present. It met all of her needs. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Burts Bees</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using the Burt&#x27;s bees &#x27;s hand salve, although I don&#x27;t like the smell of it.and I found that if you use the hand salve first and then use the body lotion to your hands  then you will have both nicely smelled scent and soft hands.</li>
    <li> Great kit for traveling or for a baby shower prize.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Burt&#x27;s bees products, and I decided to share it will my aunt, this is a great variety pack for someone to try to see what they think.</li>
