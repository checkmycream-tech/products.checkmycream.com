      <li>i used it once and wasn&#x27;t even able to finish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this item before and more than 2 at a time.</li>
      <li>This drill is just ok...</li>
      <li>but most of the time i prefer the filer over the drill&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>I needed more help than that.</li>

      <li>Excellent item, now I can do my nails like in the beauty salon without having to pay big quantities of money.</li>

      <li>i use this to remove top layer of gel nail before removing with acetone.</li>
      <li>Wish there was a case for bits to better keep up with them</li>
      <li>It is safe (will not remove your skin/full nail with light pressure.)</li>
      <li>Easy to assemble.  </li>
      <li>So I started doing it myself, and my feet have improved drastically since I am now able to keep my toenails trimmed and clean.</li>
      <li>okay, needed something a bit more powerful.</li>
      <li>Cheap cheap cheap garbage.</li>
      <li>especially given the great price.</li>
      <li>It needs to be locked securely while trying to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I am sure it is great for buffing as it barely takes anything off, but for filing a nail down it isn&#x27;t so great.</li>
      <li>and so glad the price was right</li>
      <li>Never disappointed by anything from Amazon.</li>
      <li>( I am new at doing my own nails).</li>
      <li>The second, Was it a good price?</li>
      <li>After perusing the shelves at local Targets, drug stores, and beauty shops, was thrilled to see this line at such a great price.</li>
      <li>Just spend a couple extra bucks and get a good one vs buying this one and</li>
      <li>Came quickly in the mail.  </li>
      <li>it worked for a week then became very hot and stoped working.</li>
      <li>not enough power good for light work drill bit are also good for natural nail only not bad for what i paid</li>
      <li>It is quite powerful and is great for assisting in cuticle removal, filing down nails and buffing and smoothing nails!</li>
      <li>but for the price its completely worth</li>
      <li>but for the price its completely worth .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen one as strong as that particular drill, and the newest one isn&#x27;t either.  </li>
      <li>It is powerful enough and very easy to hold and use.</li>
      <li>Yet, I have used it on fingernails and it just zips right through...</li>
      <li>The long lasting one seemed to have a stronger &amp;#34;motor&amp;#34; and worked beautifully.  </li>
      <li>It work nicely burns through battery&#x27;s but that&#x27;s to be expected and the tips fall out sometimes</li>

      <li>First time for everything.</li>
      <li>This works pretty well for how it was priced.</li>
      <li>The doctors were OK, but they only worked on my feet every 4-6 months.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>At first glance I thought &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>At first I was excited because it did a good job, but then it seriously broke after one use!</li>
      <li>We previously had one from AVON which was amazing</li>
      <li>just order a few more, to have spares!</li>
      <li>and when you press hard and it stops, it good for safety.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t really expect it work</li>
      <li>Excited to get this in the mail finally!!!</li>

      <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>Recommend it highly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works beyond my expectations! And the price is amazing too! I highly recommend this product, especially because it is a variable speed battery operated tool.  It is quite powerful and is great for assisting in cuticle removal, filing down nails and buffing and smoothing nails! I even use it on the bottom of my feet to remove calluses.  The variable speed works by depressing the button to the speed at which you want it to go.</li>
    <li> I prefer doing my own nails and this device does a nice job. I had one before that lasted &amp;#62;10 years so figured I was due for an update, especially given the great price.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t file acrylic nails that good. It may work well on bare natural nails but barely files acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> Only bad thing, it runs out of battery  quickly  other than that great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this item before and more than 2 at a time. Some have lasted only a month, and others over a year.  The long lasting one seemed to have a stronger &amp;#34;motor&amp;#34; and worked beautifully.  I&#x27;ve never seen one as strong as that particular drill, and the newest one isn&#x27;t either.  In either case, the price was so low, I still don&#x27;t believe it</li>
    <li> It does what is supposed to do for a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have allot of torque, but that is good, you need to let the speed work with the filing heads and when you press hard and it stops, it good for safety.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy the filing tools for a Dremell, they will cost you more than the hole thing.&lt;br /&gt;I just order a few more, to have spares!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had onychomycosis on my toe nails since I was 1 year old and no treatment worked on them. I use electric files to trim my awful and irregular nails so that they look a little closer to normal. I&#x27;ve owned a couple of brand(Zepter) electric nail files and they just didn&#x27;t have the power to work on my nails. I bought this one because it was very cheap and I didn&#x27;t really expect it work but it is GREAT! It is powerful enough and very easy to hold and use. The batteries seem to last a long time. I will order another just to have a spare.</li>
    <li> okay, needed something a bit more powerful. once the bits are worn, it&#x27;s done. will look for a more durable replacement</li>
    <li> I only used it twice.</li>
    <li> very handy devise, it does what I wanted to do, some people complaint that it does not work but that is not true, it does work and it files nails just perfect and I mean real nails, it prolly not strong enough for acrylic nails but on natural naisl it works great. Great value for $ and if anyone needs a nail file for acrylic nails then I would recommend to go with an electric one because they just stronger, all the battery operated ones are really meant for your natural nails only not acrylic.</li>
    <li> Did not think I would really use this for anything but hard toe nails. Yet, I have used it on fingernails and it just zips right through...and I mean zip, so be careful with that big pink one. ;)</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all! The tips don&#x27;t really do much on my nails and the actual electric pen stops working so I have to wait for it to function again before using it. Takes too long! rather do it the old fashion way!</li>
    <li> product wasnt what i expected. the pen was placed in a silk bag and the drills were placed in a small ziplock bag and some were damaged. thought it mustve been used but the drills look clean.it didnt come in a box or at least like the picture. i havent used the item yet but i hope it fulfill its purpose of use.</li>
    <li> the product is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;very powerful so do like very much,&lt;br /&gt;and I would recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> not enough power good for light work drill bit are also good for natural nail only not bad for what i paid</li>
    <li> Not worth it got it looked for English instruction none was in there. For those who don&#x27;t Know it takes 2AA batteries. I think I got a bad one because when you try to twit the cap it keeps popping off. It needs to be locked securely while trying to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. if I could I would rate This One A ZERO!! Not bragging about this product.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well for how it was priced. It took a while to be delivered, since it was coming from China &amp; does not have the carrying case for the attachments, but it works well for the price. I wish the buffing attachment was a little better, but you can&#x27;t have it all.</li>
    <li> It was a good catch for the price. When you push down on it, it starts to stop. That&#x27;s the only problem I have with it. Other than that I guess it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I love it and I use it all the time. I read a review saying you get what you pay for BUT it&#x27;s not TRUE. It works great and it&#x27;s easy to use. If it does ever break i will be more than happy to buy another one.</li>
    <li> It work nicely burns through battery&#x27;s but that&#x27;s to be expected and the tips fall out sometimes but for the price its completely worth ot</li>
    <li> The picture included a case for the drill tips, which was NOT included. It&#x27;s overpriced considering the quality and the fact it doesn&#x27;t come as pictured</li>
    <li> It seems 2nd hand/used!</li>
    <li> Attachments come out very easily, poor quality.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. It feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart once you turn it on. The attachments come off when turned on.</li>
    <li> it is everything i wanted it works great and so glad the price was right just wish the parts came with a case</li>
    <li> This drill is just ok...but most of the time i prefer the filer over the drill&lt;br /&gt;Its like &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; kind.&lt;br /&gt;Gets very minimal work done...and most of the time the while using it the attachment comes out..</li>
    <li> After perusing the shelves at local Targets, drug stores, and beauty shops, was thrilled to see this line at such a great price. Came quickly in the mail.  Easy to assemble.  Does the trick well buffing, but it took me a couple tries to get the hang of it without hurting my toes.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I had a nail infection for years, and started going for treatment by a podiatrist at the VA. The doctors were OK, but they only worked on my feet every 4-6 months. I needed more help than that. So I started doing it myself, and my feet have improved drastically since I am now able to keep my toenails trimmed and clean. This item is cheep, works well, and is great. My only complaint is that I had to wait for almost six weeks to receive it by mail, on a slow boat from China..</li>
    <li> At first glance I thought &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;. After using it though I found it to be very under powered and pretty much useless for manicure/pedicure purposes. I cannot return product since it was used on my feet, or I would return it.</li>
    <li> For the price, This is wonderful! It works so well, and it cuts time off of trying to do it by hand.</li>
    <li> At first I was excited because it did a good job, but then it seriously broke after one use! I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but it won&#x27;t turn on. Don&#x27;t waste your money, no matter how inexpensive it is. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I used this, and it smoothens your nails perfectly, and i highly recommend purchasing this product. it even comes in a cute little purple bag to keep the kit in without loosing it all. awesome</li>
    <li> The pen does not work. I snapped in the attachment and nothing happened. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the case for the attachments. it arrived broken  I WANT A REFUND PIECE OF CRAP</li>
    <li> i love it! it came with instructions on what every head does and my shippment came almost 2 weeks early then what it should have gotten here.</li>
    <li> came in broken and had to ask for a refund!</li>
    <li> Excited to get this in the mail finally!!! All to find our that after the batteries were put in, it doesn&#x27;t work. The motor works when the bits arent in because you can hear it but when you put a it in, it doesnt work. JUNK. Not that I was expecting the highest craftsmanship considering the price but I did expect it to work. Never disappointed by anything from Amazon. First time for everything. Epic Fail!</li>
    <li> The bits are crap and cheap Dont buy only giving it 1 star because I needed to so I could write this review. U can buy one like this at a family dollar. Just spend a couple extra bucks and get a good one vs buying this one and another one after u figure out it sucks.</li>
    <li> love it, it works great just as well as the nail shop and a whole lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> i use this to remove top layer of gel nail before removing with acetone. not like a salon quality but work great for dollar value.</li>
    <li> Good product, recommended seller</li>
    <li> you order a two dollar item you get a two dollar item</li>
    <li> I have had this for sometime now and it had been working and running great since I purchased it. My sisters all want one so I will be buying more as gifts</li>
    <li> Its ok I use it a lot. I didn&#x27;t understand  the instructions that came with it but I figured it out.as matter of fact there was no instructions it was just a black and white piece of paper telling you what all the pieces are and what they&#x27;re for . it doesn&#x27;t tell you how to use the different pieces.</li>
    <li> When I buy something, there are two conditions that have to be met. The first, Does it work like it&#x27;s supposed to? The second, Was it a good price? And this definetly meets both therefore I like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very good price, I love, is as I saw it on the internet. I arrive at his time, very good, I recommend the product. Excellent product, beautiful color, good material, it received in due time, very good price. I am delighted with my purchase</li>
    <li> My husband had an injury to his finger and now has a funky nail that can only be filed, not clipped. We previously had one from AVON which was amazing but its bee years and the motor is wearing down so I bought this one and it sucks. He has to spend forever to get his nail down to size...I am sure it is great for buffing as it barely takes anything off, but for filing a nail down it isn&#x27;t so great.</li>
    <li> It work nicely burns through battery&#x27;s but that&#x27;s to be expected and the tips fall out sometimes but for the price its completely worth .</li>
    <li> Just recvd today, 3-31-14.  Everything came with the drill and bits except the case shown as advertisement with drill for the drill bits. Instead bit pieces came in tiny ziplock bag. I put batteries in and it works and will serve the purpose of doing it myself at-home nails. Definitely, a good purchase for a beginner but suggest a $30 or more drill for those with more experience or doing more than at home nails.  Good buy for my intents and purposes.  Wish there was a case for bits to better keep up with them but I&#x27;ll make it work.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It is a nice file but if you want something super powerful for acrylics, invest in an expensive one...</li>
    <li> The day i got this item i put brand new batteries in it and it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this, its a piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Excellent item, now I can do my nails like in the beauty salon without having to pay big quantities of money. I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I love this little gizmo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has saved me so much time! It is safe (will not remove your skin/full nail with light pressure.)</li>
    <li> I use this as a touch up pen for my nails because its not very powerful. This is my go to in between manicures. Its not very strong, so I dont have to worry about burning my self ( I am new at doing my own nails). I would only recommend this for natural nails. I use my plug in one when working with acrylics.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for because although it came with everything as promised, once you&#x27;ve inserted one of the file attachments into the base it stops working. Cheap cheap cheap garbage.</li>
    <li> it worked for a week then became very hot and stoped working. also it would not stay together. this was a waist of money</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly had it for a yr now. Still works good</li>
    <li> I love this kit ,had it before but never in the pen form.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, an import, took forever to arrive, from China,  Works, fair at best,  I would pass on this.</li>
    <li> Teeny tiny drill. Not worth a plug nickel.</li>
    <li> i would not recommend this... it doesnt have enough power to buff the nail</li>
    <li> This product is great shipping was okay it came on time very happy will by again</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be beat for the price.  Does everything you need it to.  Second one I have bought.  Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> horrible! i used it once and wasn&#x27;t even able to finish. i thought maybe the little motor had overheated so i waited a few hours to try it again but that didnt work!!! it sucked!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as i wish</li>
    <li> This works great.  I have bought several for friends.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give no stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted something that worked faster the a nail file. But the thing didn&#x27;t work when I got it.</li>
