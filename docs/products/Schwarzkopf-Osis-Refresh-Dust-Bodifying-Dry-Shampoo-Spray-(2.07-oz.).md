      <li>Great for a quick fix.</li>
      <li>Smells lovely and is effective.</li>
      <li>Product is okay</li>
      <li>Make sure to shake all of the powder out of your hair or you&#x27;ll look like you have gray patches in hair.</li>
      <li>Like magic, you have lots of volume, that &amp;#34;dirty, day after feel&amp;#34; and no flakes.  </li>
      <li>I was able to use this product one time.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue and smells wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell.  </li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo product I have found.</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo that I have come across.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I really liked it.</li>
      <li>and I can get it quick with my Amazon Prime!</li>
      <li>and they have those huge floral arrangements.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best dry shampoo on the market.  </li>
      <li>I first started using this product with the advise of my stylist and really love the way it works.  </li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>Great for blondes not for dark haired people.</li>
      <li>I loved the dry shampoo but gave it a four star because it&#x27;s over priced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoo sprays and this one works better than most.</li>
      <li>I love the light clean floral smell, it smells expensive, like what you smell when you walk into a really nice hotel</li>
      <li>I notice they do have a larger size now also, but the little ones are perfect for travel!</li>
      <li>Make sure not to spray to close to your head though or you will see a white residue.</li>
      <li>the first go around.</li>
      <li>Thanks a bunch!</li>
      <li>Sure it gives volume, but if you shake your hair or run your fingers through you hair white powder of flaky like things get under your fingernails or on your shoulders etc.  </li>
      <li>Great for travel, but 1/2 the size of standard can of dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>better than Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have used more efficient dry shampoos.</li>
      <li>You have to blend in the white powder, but that&#x27;s easily done.</li>
      <li>I like Aveeno dry shampoo better.</li>
      <li>This is maybe absolute favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Maybe they were just using too much.  </li>
      <li>But the product itself isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; enough to do so.&lt;br /&gt;It is a light white colored spray, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to dark haired ladies unless you are really good at combing it through.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different ones from cheap to expensive and I love this one.</li>
      <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t dull hair too much, will definitely buy it again!</li>
      <li>When purchased, it would be cheaper to buy multiple items in this size than full size sold on amazon.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the Klorane brand, which has less chemical products in it.</li>
      <li>It has a decent, yet not over powering smell.  </li>
      <li>I can get it locally at Ulta, but I found other brands that work just as well (Primarily Batiste) that are more reasonably priced and are easier to obtain through a larger number of sellers on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Not bad but not much savings either.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo but the can is tiny and I can only get about 6 or 7 uses out of it.</li>
      <li>Makes hair smell freshly shampooed and gives volume back to second day hair.</li>
      <li>If I do notice a little white it is easily remedied by brushing or rubbing it in.  </li>
      <li>the price was ~10% lower, I think it would be right on par with competing with the other brands.</li>
      <li>This dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t absorb oil very well and smells like fruity farts.</li>
      <li>It really makes your dirty hair seem pretty clean.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and isn&#x27;t sticky or wet at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Kind of expensive for it to be gone so soon.  </li>
      <li>I only use 4 or 5 quick sprays a few times a week, so it lasts me about a month.</li>
      <li>I purchased this to try out a new dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>My only complaint would be that I go through these little bottles pretty quickly.  </li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> Oily but dry on ends, needs to be washed every day, but this will get me through the second day without having to wash, in a pinch.  </li>
<li> Only dry shampoo type product that has worked for my hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried roughly seven dry shampoos and this is the only one I 100% recommend.  </li>
<li> Perhaps this is the ingredient they use to add volume , but personally speaking as a freelance hairstylist I know of other ways to do this with dry shampoo.  </li>
<li> I try not to brush the pruduct through to my ends because it makes my dry, bleached hair seem dryer and the ends can get tangly.</li>
<li> TRESemme Volumizing Dry Shampoo is cheaper and works just as well.</li>
<li> I have not had this problem with other dry shampoos like Oscar Blandi.  </li>
<li> and then it&#x27;s empty.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gunky like some other dry shampoos!</li>
<li> There is little to no white residue on my dark brown hair.</li>
<li> My hair is shoulder length, and I have used one small bottle several times without using it up.</li>
<li> Several people commented that the bottles were too small and they used them up in one or two uses, but I have not had that problem.</li>
<li> I have used many other dry shampoos and this one is one of the worst.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;the price is a little too steep for me.</li>
<li> It gives my hair body and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue behind like the other dry shampoos.</li>
<li> dirty up your hair with other products such as pomade, creme or gel or even the Schwarzkopf Volumizing hairspray, then shake some Oscar Blandi dry shampoo in your hair.  </li>
<li> This bottle is approximately the same size as a can of axe body spray.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s kind of disgusting</li>
<li> Can see powder when dried.</li>
<li> Either way for me it was a waste of money.</li>
<li> The sprayer clogged up and no more product would come out.</li>
<li> (it&#x27;s too expensive for me to not use it up despite the gross smell and ineffectiveness!)</li>
<li> So either I got a bottle that was nearly empty when I received it or some mechanism failed to work when I tried it again.</li>
<li> Hard to find in stores!</li>
<li> Sorry</li>

    <li> Best dry shampoo product I have found. Price is (was?) amazing. When purchased, it would be cheaper to buy multiple items in this size than full size sold on amazon. I absolutely LOVE this product. It saves me time in the mornings (when I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(David&#x27;s wife)</li>
    <li> TRESemme Volumizing Dry Shampoo is cheaper and works just as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far. I only wish it lasted longer.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gunky like some other dry shampoos!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo that I have come across. It smells so nice! The only problem is that they don&#x27;t manufacture it in a larger size</li>
    <li> This is maybe absolute favorite dry shampoo.  I have tried many different ones from cheap to expensive and I love this one. It has a decent, yet not over powering smell.  There is little to no white residue on my dark brown hair. If I do notice a little white it is easily remedied by brushing or rubbing it in.  My only complaint would be that I go through these little bottles pretty quickly.  I think one of the cans will last me about three weeks.  Good price though, and I can get it quick with my Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> Pretty impressed with the volume this gives. You have to blend in the white powder, but that&#x27;s easily done.</li>
    <li> Only dry shampoo type product that has worked for my hair.  Oily but dry on ends, needs to be washed every day, but this will get me through the second day without having to wash, in a pinch.  Also gives good volume.  I only use 4 or 5 quick sprays a few times a week, so it lasts me about a month.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair body and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue behind like the other dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I really liked it. I wanted to make this product my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;But......&lt;br /&gt;the price is a little too steep for me. I can get it locally at Ulta, but I found other brands that work just as well (Primarily Batiste) that are more reasonably priced and are easier to obtain through a larger number of sellers on Amazon. I thought about purchasing a larger container, but the price per oz just doesn&#x27;t make sense.&lt;br /&gt;If the price was ~10% lower, I think it would be right on par with competing with the other brands. But the product itself isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; enough to do so.&lt;br /&gt;It is a light white colored spray, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to dark haired ladies unless you are really good at combing it through.</li>
    <li> I loved the dry shampoo but gave it a four star because it&#x27;s over priced. You only get about 4 uses out of the can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried roughly seven dry shampoos and this is the only one I 100% recommend.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and isn&#x27;t sticky or wet at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very blonde hair and I do notice a bit of white residue.  It&#x27;s not a big deal for me as it disappears after I brush it but it might not be good for someone with darker hair.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best dry shampoo on the market.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue and smells wonderful.  However, the lower rating is because you might get 5-6 uses out of it and then it&#x27;s empty.  Kind of expensive for it to be gone so soon.  I&#x27;m still buying it though!!!!</li>
    <li> This works great! better than Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t absorb oil very well and smells like fruity farts. It&#x27;s kind of disgusting and I can&#x27;t wait for it to run out so I can buy something different (it&#x27;s too expensive for me to not use it up despite the gross smell and ineffectiveness!) Give this one a MISS.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo but the can is tiny and I can only get about 6 or 7 uses out of it. I love the light clean floral smell, it smells expensive, like what you smell when you walk into a really nice hotel and they have those huge floral arrangements. It really makes your dirty hair seem pretty clean. I try not to brush the pruduct through to my ends because it makes my dry, bleached hair seem dryer and the ends can get tangly. If they made a bigger can this would be a staple, but this baby can is just not practical.</li>
    <li> I have used more efficient dry shampoos. My favorite is the Klorane brand, which has less chemical products in it.</li>
    <li> Love this perfect size for travel! Hard to find in stores!</li>
    <li> Product is okay I like Aveeno dry shampoo better. Great for blondes not for dark haired people. Can see powder when dried.</li>
    <li> I was able to use this product one time.  The sprayer clogged up and no more product would come out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoo sprays and this one works better than most. Make sure not to spray to close to your head though or you will see a white residue. I have oily hair and this works well!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Wish I would&#x27;ve know it&#x27;s an aerosol spray.  Didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Several people commented that the bottles were too small and they used them up in one or two uses, but I have not had that problem. Maybe they were just using too much.  My hair is shoulder length, and I have used one small bottle several times without using it up. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t dull hair too much, will definitely buy it again! I notice they do have a larger size now also, but the little ones are perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great for a quick fix.</li>
    <li> I have used many other dry shampoos and this one is one of the worst.  Sure it gives volume, but if you shake your hair or run your fingers through you hair white powder of flaky like things get under your fingernails or on your shoulders etc.  I have not had this problem with other dry shampoos like Oscar Blandi.  Perhaps this is the ingredient they use to add volume , but personally speaking as a freelance hairstylist I know of other ways to do this with dry shampoo.  This product is not necessary.  My suggestion...dirty up your hair with other products such as pomade, creme or gel or even the Schwarzkopf Volumizing hairspray, then shake some Oscar Blandi dry shampoo in your hair.  Like magic, you have lots of volume, that &amp;#34;dirty, day after feel&amp;#34; and no flakes.  I will stick with that from now on.  Sorry</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and is effective. This bottle is approximately the same size as a can of axe body spray. Great for travel, but 1/2 the size of standard can of dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> I first started using this product with the advise of my stylist and really love the way it works.  I do wonder, though, why this product is advertised as 3.4 oz. but says 2.07 oz. on the can.  I have found that ordering this at that size makes the purchase even with my stylist.  Not bad but not much savings either.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to try out a new dry shampoo. I used it once the day I got it, to test it out. When I went to use it again nothing would come out of the can. There is no way I used the entire bottle the first go around. So either I got a bottle that was nearly empty when I received it or some mechanism failed to work when I tried it again. Either way for me it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> A great price for this product, which has one of my favorites for some years now.  Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Makes hair smell freshly shampooed and gives volume back to second day hair. Make sure to shake all of the powder out of your hair or you&#x27;ll look like you have gray patches in hair.</li>
    <li> Too dry--dried out my scalp.</li>
    <li> This product works great.</li>
