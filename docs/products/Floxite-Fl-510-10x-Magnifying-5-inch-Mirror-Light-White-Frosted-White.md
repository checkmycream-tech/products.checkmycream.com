      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t happy with product.  </li>

      <li>I love this mirror because I can take it anywhere</li>

      <li>My favorite mirror.</li>
      <li>I have had one of these lights for many years could not get along without it.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t love this so returned it.</li>
      <li>This mirror with light is just what I wanted!</li>
      <li>so I will eventually sell it at a tag sale and get a better one.</li>
      <li>I love this magnifying mirror.  </li>
      <li>Went to the website and ordered the part that broke on my big one (the company website is awesome)  </li>
      <li>those many years ago, and I will never go without one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this brand of mirror</li>
      <li>to be able to see what needs correcting....</li>
      <li>I love this one also.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re doing both the eyebrow area and the chin, it IS necessary to move the arm of the mirror around a bit to get the best lighting for whatever area you&#x27;re working on.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea of it folding up to travel with.</li>
      <li>so I was pleased to find it on your site.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect magnification, easy to pack for travel, and comes apart and back together very easily.</li>
      <li>The mirror is great and does not distort and the light is in the right spot.  </li>
      <li>the mirror itself is very good..but cannot use the light!!!</li>
      <li>My first was a 5x - still have, but I really like the 10x best that I purchased from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>good mirror in good company but way smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>The light would be better if it was under the mirror like on my Sharper Image Mag.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be sharper and the light would provide better vision</li>
      <li>For eyebrows, I position the light at the top of the mirror.  </li>
      <li>Lighting is excellent (unlike what I found on other brands).</li>
      <li>Good price and great little mirror...</li>
      <li>The 5X served me well for many years, but now that I need a little help with closeup, this 10X is perfect.  </li>
      <li>they are compact and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>makes it easy to&lt;br /&gt;zero</li>
      <li>so you can easily put it in your suitcase.</li>
      <li>I liked my mirror so much, I bought 2 more for my granddaughters for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>It seems well made, the lighting is good but only suitable for tweezing and seeing pores</li>
      <li>Helpful mirror to see fine details.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It works ok but the light is in a place where you get shadows on your face or blind yourself as you try to pluck&lt;br /&gt;a hair or two.  The light would be better if it was under the mirror like on my Sharper Image Mag. Mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror width is to small. Needs to be inches larger.</li>
    <li> This mirror was a replacement for one that was very old  It was a perfect match and exactly what I ordered</li>
    <li> I got lasik prk surgery to improve my distance vision but now it is hard to see to tweeze etc.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is such a good mirror. I never want to be without one again. I have rosacea and I get to the pustules before they get large enough to be apparent to anyone else.  I also was able to figure out I lost a filling in my tooth with this.&lt;br /&gt;One bulb burned out right away but it comes with 2. The other has lasted over a month so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with my mirror because I find the mirror too small for 10x magnification. You can&#x27;t see very much of your face only small areas. You cannot look in the mirror and see your whole face. I think for this strong a magnification you need a bigger size mirror. I love the idea of it folding up to travel with. I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t get a lower magnification but I thought it would be good.</li>
    <li> This great.  I only use for my eye makeup so the size is fine.  You can see every pore.  Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> This mirror with light is just what I wanted! It is always a pleasure to order from Amazon! I have never been disappointed!</li>
    <li> Works well with makeup and tweezing eye brows.  10x is perfect and the size fits easily on counter , sink etc</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this type of mirror.  My first was a 5x - still have, but I really like the 10x best that I purchased from Amazon.  You can easily turn the mirror 360 degrees (the mirror just pushes onto the light source arm and can be twisted if needed) to get the best light on the area of your face that you are working on.  For eyebrows, I position the light at the top of the mirror.  I change the angle of light with the arm and by turning the whole base, to have the light at the bottom for the chin area.  It makes plucking all those pesky hairs very easy when you can see them up close with this lighted mirror. A very handy little lighted and magnified mirror for all your plucking, makeup, and teeth hygiene.  It is really a great item and soon you can&#x27;t do without it when you find out how well it works.</li>
    <li> I have a Flocite 8x magnification travel mirror that I&#x27;ve had for at least 14 years.  My 72 year old mother in law used mine on a trip and was amazed at how well she could see to apply her makeup.  I purchased this mirror for her for Christmas and she was so excited that she received one of her very own.  I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> My almost Mother in law had one of these and I fell in love!! The mirror is great and does not distort and the light is in the right spot.  This is a great little mirror to get rid of those unwanted facial hairs. It&#x27;s not the prettiest mirror out there but it is the best!!!</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t happy with product.  The lighting on it is horrible.  It cost way to much for what it actually is.  Don&#x27;t buy it if you want good lighting.  I had no problem with seeler, and receiving on time.</li>
    <li> I have owned this mirror for over 4 years and due to a fire in my house I had to replace it with a new one. I was so glad when I found it on line. I love this mirror because I can take it anywhere I go, it has great magnification and the lighting is so good on this one. I have it hanging on my wall next to my sink so I use it everyday to get those ugly hairs off my face that I could not see with a regular mirror.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought a mirror like this at Brookstone over 10 years ago and it was fantastic.  I finally found it again and was so happy because it is a fantastic mirror!!!!   5 Stars for sure!!!!!</li>
    <li> After searching stores forever, I was ecstatic to find online a Floxite 10X to replace the 8X I have owned and loved for years. I&#x27;m not ecstatic now. The 10X simply doesn&#x27;t cut it. It is not nearly as sharp as the old 8X. After a few weeks of use, I dug out the packaging, convinced I had been sent a 5X by mistake. The box clearly states 10X. The unit itself is not marked--maybe it&#x27;s really a 5X in a 10X box. I&#x27;m keeping it only because it was the arm, which broke years ago, that demanded replacement (good thing I have a hubby who&#x27;s good at \\&quot;make do\\&quot; fixes). Now the new base is sporting the old 8X mirror. Pretty expensive arm replacement. When the arm breaks again, which it will (probably within the year), I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere unless Floxite is kind enough to send me a 10X that really is 10X.</li>
    <li> good mirror in good company but way smaller than I thought it would be. I wouldn&#x27;t buy a bigger one but not this particular one again.</li>
    <li> Could not see in the strange mirror at all...had to return it.  Really too bad because it is a good size for travel.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  I had one for years and it just got old and the bulb burnt out, so I decided to just get a new one.  while I was at it I got one for my Mom and my daughter-in-law for mothers day.  They have both liked mine.  You can see more than you want to!!!</li>
    <li> I had older model for years.  When I broke the mirror, decided to try new.  Ordered other brands and was so disappointed.  This one delivers!!!!  Be careful what you ask for.  I got greater magnification and I can see way too much now!!!!!  Lighting is excellent (unlike what I found on other brands).</li>
    <li> A fantastic mirror.  You will be amazed at how close and clear this mirror image is.  I have had this for several months and love it.</li>
    <li> Used this mirror 3 times and it blew a bulb 2 out of 3.  Luckily it came with 2 extra bulbs, however, now I have no extra and don&#x27;t care to have to special order them from the enclosed order form.  The light is not very bright and because of the curved design on the mirrow you must be very close to be able to focus causing the light to land on your chin only.  Not impressed and I am returning this product.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent service. I bought a second one for a friend for her birthday. She loves it too!</li>
    <li> After using this not more than a total of two hours since purchase, both bulbs have burned out!!!!  Not happy!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, however, my wife has gone through three of these within a year to a year and a half time frame. The first one, the bulb burnt out, and the replacement bulbs didn&#x27;t fit or work either. The second one, the mirror cracked. It&#x27;s OK, but doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up very long.</li>
    <li> I am ordering this to replace my 17 year old Floxite mirror. It finally died! I can not function without it! If you need to pluck eyebrows or get a close up of your facial pores this is the mirror for you!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the mirror on this on. It&#x27;s just too small so I&#x27;m using the mirror from my old light and it works great.</li>
    <li> A question was asked, &amp;#34;Can you change the bulb if it goes out? I have one that you can&#x27;t.&amp;#34;  When I went to respond to the question, I got &amp;#34;this discussion has been removed&amp;#34;, so I am answering in this fashion for the person who asked.  The mirror came with one bulb already installed, a choice of two different filter lenses, and a small box that had TWO replacement bulbs in it.  When you use up these three bulbs, which should last you a long time, additional replacement bulbs can be purchased, either here on Amazon, directly from Floxite, or I have just gone to a local electrical supply shop and picked up a bulb if I needed a replacement.  It does take a little maneuvering to remove the bulb to replace it.  You may have thought that it didn&#x27;t come out in the mirror you had, when in actuality it did.  It doesn&#x27;t just pop in and out. According to the written instructions:  &amp;#34;To change Light Bulb #55  Unplug the power cord from the outlet.  Gently push in on the bulb and turn to the left to unlock, then pull to remove.  To insert, align bulb knobs with socket slots and push in gently, then turn to the right to lock into place.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Have used this brand for years.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror for many years, had to buy a new one because I dropped it and broke the mirror.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it on trips...easy to transport and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
    <li> As I get older, I need the assistance of a magnifying mirror to tweeze and check  my makeup application. This is the best mirror and I gave had a few. I even have a much larger table top magnifying  mirror that does not magnify 10X or light up as well as this little product and it is small and lightweight enough for me to bring on trips.</li>
    <li> Good price and great little mirror...although I wish I&#x27;d ordered the larger one. It takes up very little room and will be easy to transport.</li>
    <li> Im returning the product. The mirror ring does not attach security to the light base. It has way too much play. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the best I have found. Both my daughter loved mine. One bought her own and the other wanted one for Christmas. These mirrors at one time were sold at Bed, Bath and Beyond but they no longer have anything as good as these mirrors. I couldn&#x27;t find any for sale locally. So glad I could order them. Great order and receive time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I had expected, but it will work and maybe this time we won&#x27;t drop it. lol I love the magnification. Thank you for your speedy shipment of our purchases. :)</li>
    <li> Had one of these mirrors that broke....this item was MUCH cheaper than the one I originally purchased and the quality is BETTER.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Floxite mirror before.  This is a great size for travel.  This mirror is great for putting on makeup and plucking eyebrows. Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> My larger version broke in my suitcase. Didn&#x27;t realize they made a smaller version and I bought this by mistake. Way too small. Ended up buying a larger one at a brick and mortar.</li>
    <li> My favorite mirror. Great for applying makeup. You can really see the hairs to pluck eyebrows also. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these lights for many years could not get along without it. The light folds down and the mirror comes off for easy travel, I take it with me everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> It broke within five uses. The mirror was nice, but need the light to see more clearly. Sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I had a floxite mirror that finally broke after over 20 years.  I have replaced it with this one and it is outstanding.  I love these mirrors they are compact and easy to use.  the light makes all the difference.  thanks!</li>
    <li> I love it great for finding those hairs you did not know were there, like around your mouth or under your nose</li>
    <li> Great lite and magnifier for facial work.  Very adjustable.  Don&#x27;t even need glasses to get the fine little hairs spotted.</li>
    <li> It is a very good quality, however I had another Floxite mirror that was ~8&amp;#34;, however I broke the base of it.  I took the base of this mirror and put the larger mirror on it, so now it works great.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great for at home and travel because it is not quite a full size mirror the mirror comes off and the base folds up so you can easily put it in your suitcase.</li>
    <li> The mirror light is a replacement for a broken one. The new one is much heavier and seems to be better quqlity</li>
    <li> Unless the mirror is at the tip of your nose everything reflected is upside down. I called the manufacturer help line and they said that depending on my sight that is the way it worked. Sooooo, even if I wanted to use it for a makeup mirror, I would have to all but rest my nose on the mirror to bring anything into focus.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time for putting in my contacts. Its great for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife . She Loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and a good value if the thing continues&lt;br /&gt;to perform well.&lt;br /&gt;Listen UP</li>
    <li> This mirror just is not practical to use.  You have to get your face real close to it, and since it&#x27;s a small mirror you can only see small sections of your face at a time.  The light is like a little spot light and does not distribute light evenly.  We returned it.  I do not recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these types of Floxite mirrors because I liked them, so much, however, I have purchased my last one. Both have broken in the exact place and I feel it&#x27;s a design flaw.  The mirror itself is attached to a plastic ring that slips over the stand/base and therein lies the problem.  Because the mirror is heavier than the base, it must be pushed back onto the stand so that it will not fall over to one side or the other.  When you do that, stress is put on that plastic ring and in a short time, it breaks. The mirrors are expensive and this product is NOT worth the money.</li>
    <li> Ill be returning this mirror since its too small. You only see small parts of the face. Light is great,but doesnt eliminate the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Funny, right after I posted this review the mirror broke as I was packing it. Going to the trash now.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this, I was hesitant to purchase because its relative small...but it is powerful.  It comes with extra bulbs and replacement part numbers.  It gives you a very up close and personal view of your face.  I use to apply my false lashes.</li>
    <li> This is the best magnifier mirror I have ever experienced.  This was my second one.  The first lasted 40 years!  Do you believe it?</li>
    <li> I really like the 10 magnification, but the mirror quite small.</li>
    <li> This is an EXTREMELY small mirror. I have a 9 inch one that I was replacing... I will save the small one for traveling. Went to the website and ordered the part that broke on my big one (the company website is awesome)  Saved me $40 by just replacing the broken mirror~</li>
    <li> Now that my eyesight has declined this is the must have mirror for home and to take on trips. I have purchased many but this one is absolutely the best.</li>
    <li> This mirror is worth every penny! You will never find this kind of quality @ discount stores. Light and view is amazing for tweezing especially. I always travel with it since it folds down.  I had my last one for at least 8 years before it finally gave out.  I recommend storing your mirror unfolded to avoid daily folding of the base. This keeps it in better shape over the longrun. I only fold when traveling. I will always own one of these.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a replacement for a Floxite that is 15 years old. Can&amp;#34;t live without one!&lt;br /&gt;Also, purchased the second one for a gift, and she loves hers!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a 10x Magnifying 5-inch Mirror and found this one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Floxite Fl-510 10x Magnifying 5-inch Mirror Light, White, Frosted White was priced&lt;br /&gt;right on Amazon. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> I had a magnifying make mirror of the same brand. I was trying to replace it. This was very tiny, did not have a regular sided mirror and was not nearly the quality of the one I was trying to replace that was the same price. I would never recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is well lit, and very adjustable as far as the position.  I also like the relatively small size.</li>
    <li> I like this lighted mirror because the light is under the mirror.  I have a similar one made by the same manufacturer, with the light in the mirror and there is much more glare on the eyes.</li>
    <li> This mirror is small but mighty!  It does the job brilliantly. This is just the right size for eyebrow plucking.  I recommend this whole-heartedly.</li>
    <li> The magnification on this mirror made it impossible to apply makeup.  I had to have this mirror about 2 inches from my face to be in focus.  It seems well made, the lighting is good but only suitable for tweezing and seeing pores you never knew you had. You can only see small parts of your face at a time.  Replacing this with a 5X magnifying and 7 in. mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a 5x magnification. I have had one of these mirrors for 20 years. It is the perfect magnification, easy to pack for travel, and comes apart and back together very easily. The re-placement light bulbs are easy to find at a local store.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in February, it broke on March 20th! Complete waste of money. You have to constantly move your face into focus in order to see yourself in the mirror. It is so small too. I had read the reviews and thought it would be great, its cheaper than some of the other mirrors on the market, and it had the 10Xmagnifying I was looking for. Well its garbage. I&#x27;m gonna spend the extra few bucks and buy one that is worth it, with a larger mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror itself is great. I wish I had gotten one that was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd one I have owned!! I just love everything about it especially that I can see well. I also take it when I travel which it packs very well. I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> The first thing I have to say is OMG!  I first got a Floxite mirror through Brookstone about 25 years ago which was a 5X.  I liked it so much that even before I had any trouble with the mirror, I purchased a \\&quot;backup\\&quot; one.  That first one lasted about ten years and then I went to my backup, which lasted another fifteen years, just now dying on me.  I decided that since I&#x27;m older now, and starting to have trouble seeing close that maybe I should try the 10X this time around.  I figured, if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could always just use the 5X mirror from the dead one (having my fingers crossed that it would fit - btw, it does).  So, I went ahead and ordered this 10X from Amazon.  At first I thought, \\&quot;Whoa! This is close!\\&quot;  But then I saw what I had been missing.  I was almost horrified seeing all the stray hairs that I had failed to pluck from my eyebrows.  And then, I looked at my chin.  It&#x27;s a sad fact that as we get older, pesky strays start showing up in the chin area.  I thought I was getting everything with my old 5X...until I looked at myself with this new 10X!  As horrifying as the sight was, I&#x27;m sure glad to now be able to see what I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;missing\\&quot; and to make sure that I get every last stray.  I really worried that the 10X might be too strong to be usable, but it is fantastic.  If you&#x27;re doing both the eyebrow area and the chin, it IS necessary to move the arm of the mirror around a bit to get the best lighting for whatever area you&#x27;re working on.  With my old 5X&#x27;s, I could just leave it in one position.  But with the increased magnification, you do have to fiddle a bit with getting the light directed at the spot you need.  But it sure is great (in that horrifying way!) to be able to see what needs correcting....And on a different note, let me mention Amazon&#x27;s shipping.  I ordered this mirror late on a Saturday evening.  Since I was getting another item together with it, the shipment qualified for the Free Super Saver shipping, which normally takes a little longer.  Sunday afternoon I received an email that the parcel had been shipped and that the estimated delivery date would be the  coming Friday.  Imagine my surprise when I received the package on Tuesday!  Not Tuesday following that estimated Friday delivery date, but the Tuesday prior!  That was fast and much appreciated since I was doing without a functioning lighted mirror.  I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this brand of mirror those many years ago, and I will never go without one.  The 5X served me well for many years, but now that I need a little help with closeup, this 10X is perfect.  For those who are new to these mirrors, these ARE NOT MAKEUP MIRRORS!  Yes, they would help you see better putting on eyeliner, seeing one eye at a time, but you can&#x27;t see your whole face, and you&#x27;re not supposed to with these.  They are for closeup work and they are a necessity.</li>
    <li> It is much smaller than I thought.  I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> this is great I just wish the mirror was a little larger</li>
    <li> Just the right magnification for old eyes when doing close-up work on one&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> The magnification feature creates distortions from certain angles of mirrow, making it almost impossible to view certain desired areas.  For instance, if looking at the nose, the chin is out of focus, which was not the problem with the old mirror.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be sharper and the light would provide better vision but I don&#x27;t think it is as good as the last one I had.</li>
    <li> I did not expect the magnification to be so big---I do know that it said it would have a magnification of 10x, but I had no idea how much that was.</li>
    <li> Good product and good service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased. The only problem I have is that I should have ordered a bigger mirror.</li>
    <li> Make sure you look closely at the size/measurements before you buy this mirror. It is REALLY SMALL. I returned it because it was so small it was actually extremely hard to use.</li>
    <li> My fault, hadn&#x27;t realized the mirror area is very small compared to my previous mirror which was lower magnification.  I switched, using my larger mirror onto this base, solving the problem.  Previous base broke at swivel point but had lasted many years, too many plastic parts, making it unable to repair.</li>
    <li> Really brings out all the flaws.  If you are 23, its super, but past 30 it can be a wake up call.  Difficult to assemble</li>
    <li> it is okay.  Had one from years ago and I like it better, actually.  Don&#x27;t understand what the diff is.</li>
    <li> She couldn&#x27;t believe how much she could see, every pore, every hair--scary.  I love mine so much I wanted to share and I was not disappointed with her reaction.</li>
    <li> Helpful mirror to see fine details. Especially the eyes,&lt;br /&gt;Shows your pores in distinct detail. makes it easy to&lt;br /&gt;zero in on what you need to see.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, and easy to pack</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! This is the 2nd one I have bought, so I can keep one at our summer cottage.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t love this so returned it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t maneuver well and I can&#x27;t get it down to see my chin. I want to send it back, but don&#x27;t have time now so I will eventually sell it at a tag sale and get a better one.</li>
    <li> I liked my mirror so much, I bought 2 more for my granddaughters for Christmas.  They love them so much.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong size because the mirror was so small.  It would be great for traveling but the good thing is that the mirror I had could fit on the base of the new mirror and thank goodness the stand is a better stand so that the whole thing doesn&#x27;t fall over because of the size of the mirror.  The stand has a stabilizer that my old stand did not have.  Thanks for the improvement.</li>
    <li> The mirror lacked the shades..so the light was too bright and blinding..the mirror itself is very good..but cannot use the light!!! Where are the shades??</li>
    <li> This mirror works great for plucking eyebrows.  The combination of light with magnifying mirror makes the job a lot easier.  It does fold up well for travel, but I don&#x27;t travel with it.</li>
    <li> I love this magnifying mirror.  I had one that finally stopped working after probably 20 years, so I wanted to get another one just like it and found it on Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had this exact one before and i used it till it broke. I love this one also. Only thing was the bulb went out within 3 weeks! Good thing you enclosed extra ones.</li>
    <li> Fantastic like all floxite mirrors.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be however the size was clearly stated. My wife has the bigger size and is happy with this for travel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror many years ago at Brookstones&#x27;s. It was great. When the switch no longer worked, the Floxite company sent me a new one free of charge. I installed the new switch, using the mirror until it recently broke and could not be repaired. I franticly looked for another, but could only find it at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new mirror arrived quickly, for which I was thankful. It is actually the same as the old EXCEPT it no longer has a battery component in the base. It is a corded plug- in only. Due to where the plug is situated in my home, the cord tends to get in the way. I have also found that because there is no battery component, the base is not as heavy and sometimes moves. Despite this, I do like this mirror as well as the company that makes it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d purchased a Floxite magnifying mirror several years ago and the mirror had finally broken on it.  I searched all over to find a duplicate, same brand, but this is the only one they offerred.  While it works well, the mirror itself is a lot smaller than my old one and is a little difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Aargh…just got this as a Christmas gift and the mirror popped out and broke.  Can you buy just replacement mirrors&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> These are my favorite magnifying mirrors. They actually magnify 10x, and the light means you actually can see what is magnified. Plus the stand works well for adjusting to how you approach the mirror. I&#x27;ve bought them before, and I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> I love it! Best little travel mirror ever!</li>
    <li> Its ok have to get used to it. They want you to add words sometimes there&#x27;s noting really to say</li>
    <li> I had this same light for about 15 years and needed a replacement.  Bed Bath and Beyond no longer offered it so I was pleased to find it on your site.</li>
